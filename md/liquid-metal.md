Abstract The combination of fluidity and metallic conductivity has attracted considerable attention to liquid metal (LM), but its development remains challenging due to enormous surface tension. Here, vinyl‐terminated silicone oil and platinum catalyst are added to LM to reduce its surface tension, which develops a special type of liquid‐metal‐silicone (LMS) ink with a catalyst diffusion effect. Combined with an embedded three‐dimentional (3D) printing method, the LMS ink is printed on the support matrix, and the catalyst diffuses outward along the print path to cure the silicone around it, directly constructing self‐encapsulated conductive composites with excellent conductivity and self‐encapsulated flexible tactile sensors based on triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity (0.308 V kPa −1 ), high linearity (≈0.99), and good durability (over 10 000 cycles). Furthermore, when used in flexible wearable electronics, the sensor demonstrates a good performance with an accuracy of ≈96% in classifying different human postures using a convolutional neural network. Finally, through embedded 3D printing with LMS ink and silicone ink, a somatosensory soft robotic gripper with complex cavity structures is designed and manufactured in one step, achieving the all‐in‐one integration of sensors and actuators. This study shows great application potential in flexible electronics and soft robotic systems.

Thermo-catalytic decomposition (TCD) of natural gas is a suitable technology to provide clean hydrogen (H2). This TCD process directly splits hydrocarbons, mainly methane (CH4), into H2 and carbon as illustrated in Equation 1. [Equation 1]CH4(g)→C(s)+2H2(g)ΔH∘=74 kJ/mol In TCD process, H2 is produced as a gas while carbon is generated in solid form. Though the reaction can occur with heat energy alone, the use of a catalyst significantly reduces the required reaction temperature, making the process less energy-intensive. Various reactor designs are used for TCD to pyrolyze CH4, including fluidized/packed bed reactor, moving bed reactor, bubble column reactor (using molten metal or salt), and plug flow reactor. This paper elucidates ROTOBOOST's bubble column reactor, which utilizes a specific molten metal alloy as TCD catalyst. Although methane pyrolysis demonstration has started since the 1950s, the development and understanding of liquid catalyst in bubble column has gained more momentum since the 2000s. This stems from the benefit of lowering the reaction temperature to below 1000°C, making the process less energy-intensive, mitigating coking issues and subsequent deactivation of solid catalysts, and allowing better control and tuning of solid carbon quality Von Wald et al. (2020) reported that methane pyrolysis using the bubble column technology with liquid metal catalyst is a suitable process for reducing CO2 emissions in the short term. In TCD process with bubble column reactor, pre-treated natural gas or methane is continuously fed to the bottom of the reactor, allowing it to travel upward through the molten catalytic alloy, which is heated to the reaction temperature. The catalytic alloy, with high heat capacity, provides a homogenous heat supply directly to each hydrocarbon gas molecule. As the bubbles burst at the upper interface of the liquid media, H2 and carbon are released. Since the density of carbon is much lower than that of the molten media, the produced carbon rises with the bubbles, floating at top of the liquid surface, and finally deposits at the surface of the liquid column. Therefore, the produced carbon does not affect the reaction zone on the inside/surface of the bubbles as they rise through the molten media, ensuring the bubble surface is a continuously renewed catalyst. The main advantage of liquid bubble column reactors is the continuous carbon removal from the liquid media due to density differences, preventing reactor blockage or contamination from carbon accumulation.

Established in 1949, The University of New South Wales (UNSW) stands as a globally recognized institution in research and education. It has earned a reputation as one of Australia's leading universities for research quality and influence and was placed among the top 50 universities globally in the 2021 Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities. The University also ranks within the top 20 universities worldwide in the QS World University Rankings for 2024. Its leading position in materials science within Australia is reflected in its #1 ranking in this field, according to the 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities by subject. UNSW has driven progress in materials science and engineering through cutting-edge research and innovation. This special issue of Advanced Materials marks the 75th anniversary of UNSW, featuring a collection of Reviews and Research articles that bring attention to the ongoing materials research by UNSW scientists and their national and international collaborators. The issue presents research efforts and advancements in the areas of catalytic materials, biomaterials, superconducting materials, and materials for energy, optoelectronic, environmental, and food technologies, crossing the interface of chemistry, physics, and life science. In the field of catalyst materials, Professor Liming Dai and co-workers review the recent progress, challenges, and future directions in carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts (C-MFECs) for clean energy and chemical conversions (article number 2405664). Professor Zhenhai Xia and co-workers discuss innovative strategies, such as physics-inspired descriptors, high-throughput computational techniques, and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted design with machine learning (ML), for the rational design of carbon catalysts (article number 2407102). These carbon-based catalysts, together with single atom catalysts with and without carbon substrates (reviewed by Professor Chuan Zhao and co-workers in article number 2404659), have been extensively applied in the development of various electro- and photocatalytic processes for energy-chemical conversion, environmental remediation, and biomedical applications. Examples include photocatalytic solar hydrogen generation (reviewed by Professor Rose Amal and co-workers in article number 2404618), water electrolysis (reviewed by Professor Sean Li and co-workers in article number 2404658), electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (reviewed by Dr Rahman Daiyan and co-workers in article number 2405029), and flow batteries (reviewed by Professor Da-Wei Wang and co-workers in article number 2405029). A research paper (article number 2408560) by Professors Liming Dai, Zi Gu, and co-workers introduces a novel approach to catalytic cancer therapy using a metal-free, near-infrared (NIR)-responsive co-catalyst composed of phosphorous-doped carbon nitride (P-C3N4) and graphene quantum dots (GQD). The GQD converts NIR into visible light to activate P-C3N4, catalyzing glucose into hydrogen peroxide and generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill cancer cells. Regarding biomedical materials, Professor Chun Hui Wang and co-workers review the latest developments in energy harvesting and storage technologies for wearable and implantable medical devices, detailing strategies to improve the performance and reliability of these devices for clinical use (article number 2404492). Recent progress in self-powered wearable devices is reviewed by Professor Dewei Chu and co-workers, who explore the role of MXene-based materials in these devices and the impact of multi-interface engineering on material performance for energy storage and conversion (article number 2403791). Associate Professor Kristopher Kilian and co-workers provide an overview of advances in Synthetic Extracellular Matrix (ECM) mimics designed to replicate the complex biochemical and mechanical properties of native tissues (article number 2404235). Professor Nick Di Girolamo and co-workers review improvements in isolating and cultivating robust stem cell populations using biomaterial scaffolds and new biomedical engineering techniques to improve clinical outcomes for patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (article number 2401763). Professor Ewa Goldys and co-workers review the use of auto fluorophores for non-invasive and label-free biological assays, featuring technologies such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and hyperspectral microscopy for detecting endogenous fluorescent compounds (article number 2403761). Concerning materials for superconducting, energy, optoelectronic, and food technologies, Professor Charles Christopher Sorrell, Professor Sean Li, and co-workers review superconducting materials with interfacial superconductivity and interface-enhanced superconductivity, examining the major factors and potential mechanisms to illuminate pathways toward achieving high transition temperature for advancing superconductivity research toward practical, high-temperature applications (article number 2405009). In a research paper (article number 2408933), Professor Kourosh Kalantar-Zadeh, Professor Guangzhao Mao, Dr. Jianbo Tang, and co-workers designed arrays of liquid metal marbles consisting of a gallium-indium eutectic alloy with a copper-doped ZnS luminescent coating for pixelated visualization of electric discharge paths at optical imaging length-scales, enabling logic computing and information encoded display for new-generation electric discharge-based optoelectronics. Professor Guangzhao Mao and co-workers offer an updated perspective on charge-transfer complexes, discussing their advanced synthesis, unique properties, future developments, and existing limitations as emerging organic semiconductors for optoelectronics (LEDs, solar cells, photodetectors), catalysis, and gas sensors (article number 2406083). Although various food sensors, including gas sensors, have been developed for food quality monitoring and contaminant detection to reduce food waste and food-related illness, few of these sensor technologies have been translated into commercial products. Associate Professor Rona Chandrawati and co-workers review recent material and design advances on the integration of sensors into materials and devices for food packaging and processing, aimed at on-site testing and identifying the complexity and natural variation in food products and different causes of food spoilage. Challenges and opportunities relating to food sensor translation are also discussed (article number 2404274). In the area of environmental materials, Professor Guan Yeoh and co-workers review the use of carbon materials, such as graphite, graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon dots, and fullerenes with and without functionalization, for flame retardants, and their effectiveness in enhancing polymer flame resistance (article number 2403835). On the other hand, the scale-up of silver recycling from end-of-life crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels is still at an early stage, particularly through continuous operations (e.g., in continuously stirred tank reactors, CSTR). Using an integrated experimental and numerical simulation approach, Professor Yansong Shen and co-workers investigate and optimize the recovery of silver within CSTR. This study focuses on improvements in silver leaching performance with enhanced CSTR designs, providing insights into the hydrodynamics and particle-scale behavior of the leaching process (article number 2403653).
