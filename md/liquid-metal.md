Liquid metal (LM) nanodroplets possess intriguing surface properties, thus offering promising potential in chemical synthesis, catalysis, and biomedicine. However, the reaction kinetics and product growth at the surface of LM nanodroplets are significantly influenced by the interface involved, which has not been thoroughly explored and understood. Here, we propose an interface engineering strategy, taking a spontaneous galvanic reaction between Ga
