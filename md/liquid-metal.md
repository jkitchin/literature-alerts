Abstract Functional nanoporous materials are considered a significant category of nanostructured materials that exhibit distinct characteristics like high surface area, porosity, and improved mass transport properties. These qualities render them suitable for a wide range of applications including catalysis, energy storage, biomedical fields, and electrochemical sensors. Dealloying or laser-induced technologies are the primary methods employed to fabricate such nanoporous materials. Dealloying is a dependable top-down approach used to produce hierarchical, disordered nanoporous materials with customizable pore sizes in the range of a few nanometers. The process of dealloying involves the selective elimination or dissolution of one or more elements from an alloy through a corrosion mechanism, using various dealloying techniques, such as chemical, electrochemical, liquid metal, or vapor phase dealloying. In the present study, copper-based amorphous metallic ribbons (Cu75Ni6Sn5P10Ga4) were initially manufactured using the melt-spinning method. The Cu-based amorphous ribbons were structurally investigated by X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. Subsequently, the ribbons were subjected to a dealloying treatment, using an acidic solution to selectively dissolve the nickel from their composition and to obtain a nanoporous structure. The microstructure and chemical composition of the ribbons before and after the dealloying process were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The dealloying process performed in 1 M H2SO4 solution at 25 °C for 60 minutes leads to a large number of nanopores, uniformly distributed onto the surface of the Cu-based ribbons.
