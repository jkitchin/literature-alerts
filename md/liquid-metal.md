The exceptional properties of liquid metals at room temperature, such as their fluidity, stretchability, deformability, and potential applications, have rapidly inspired the scientific community. At present, the main challenge is overcoming technical barriers associated with the characterization of liquid metal systems, which have resulted in their molecular structure remaining effectively unknown. This lack of knowledge has significantly hampered the progress of the emerging field of liquid metal chemistry, prohibiting tailored design and relegating researchers to work by trial and error. In recent years, several technological and scientific developments, including improved analytical tools, have emerged that have the potential to tackle the current challenges. In this review, we present a comprehensive appraisal of the various state-of-the-art characterization techniques that can help uncover answers to long-standing questions in the domain of liquid metals and metal-in-metal colloidal systems. We describe selected generic methodologies and several unique approaches that can capture the various changes in the physical and chemical behavior of molten metals in the presence of internal and external stimuli. In combination, the outlined tools will deepen our understanding of liquid metal chemistry and will accelerate research translation to provide solutions in areas such as catalysis, biomedicine, and reconfigurable electronics.

Extraction of aqueous uranium element for practical applications has drawn growing attention due to its significance for both green energy acquirement and ecological environment remediation. Herein, the liquid metal droplets produced by a facile ultra-sonication process are found to be able to capture aqueous uranyl ions with a maximal adsorption capacity up to 237 mg g−1 (1483 mg cm−3), and further to reduce them into insoluble UO2 nanoparticles (2–5 nm in diameter). With the homogeneous immobilization of UO2 nanoparticles, the ultra-thin shell of liquid metal droplets exhibits a high catalytic activity towards electrochemical reductions e.g., CO2 reduction. The liquid metal core, when supporting on the electrodes, also offers the efficient electro-transporting pathway for electrochemical reaction. With a high formate selectivity, a faradaic efficiency ≥91.4 % and a generation rate as high as 988.9 mmol g−1h−1 of C1 products (i.e., CO and formate) are achieved in the CO2 reduction. Thus, this study may offer not only a unique platform of liquid metal nanodroplets for extracting uranium from water, but also a novel route of fabricating high-efficiency electrochemical catalysts for CO2 conversion.

Solar powered electrochemical CO₂ reduction to disposable products is presently being developed as one of negative carbon emission technologies 1 . State-of-the-art electrocatalysts are mainly developed for the CO 2 reduction to hydrogen rich products or chemical feedstock materials while for the above-mentioned application solid carbon-rich products are desired (best pure carbon). Even though the formation of solid products is sometimes observed on catalysts (coking effect), this usually leads to an undesirable irreversible deactivation of their solid interfaces. Thus, the development of next generation CO 2 electrocatalysts is demanded based on liquid metal alloys such as galinstan (GaInSn). The advantage of using liquid phase electrodes is to eliminate coking and coarsening limitations that are associated with solid catalysts. For example, it has been reported that ceria-supported liquid galinstan can electrochemically produce carbonaceous materials from CO 2 gas 2 . This shows, that doping with additional active elements can change the CO 2 reduction activity of GaInSn in the direction of other desired products. Our work investigates the activity of galinstan for the electroreduction of CO 2 depending on alloying with additional metals (such as Ce, Ag, Pb). While pure GaInSn shows a predominant activity for the formation of C1 products (CO, HCOOH) in DMF/H 2 O electrolyte, we are mainly interested in the formation of solid carbon or oxalate. Therefore, our investigations aim at finding suitable modifications of GaInSn that achieve high selectivity for these products. Electrochemical analysis coupled with in-line gas chromatography and in-line mass spectroscopy are used to characterize the reactivity. Furthermore, the influence of the water content of the organic electrolyte on the product selectivity will be investigated. In particular, to suppress the observed low hydrogen evolution as a by-product even more efficiently. May, M.

Here, upon the invitation of Matter’s editorial team, four postdocs from four Chinese institutes with various backgrounds and research expertise share their insights in seeking academic positions. Here, upon the invitation of Matter’s editorial team, four postdocs from four Chinese institutes with various backgrounds and research expertise share their insights in seeking academic positions. One of the best parts of this position is interacting with the next generation of researchers (and potential Matter authors). When I undertake site visits, my slide deck is designed to promote the Cell Press portfolio (gotta pay the bills) and give some editorial tips, but also to spur discussion among grad students and postdocs about how to position themselves for successful academic careers. One tip: build a relationship with your favorite editor! Last year (February 2023), we solicited comments from four postdocs who were seeking academic positions in North America. It was a huge success in terms of interest and readership, and I’m hoping that there were some useful insights in the article (Reflections in search of faculty positions). However, academia is global, and while there are universal trials and tribulations in seeking a faculty position, there are many more local idiosyncrasies. Recognizing this, for this year, Matter editor Tina Zhang and I sought out four postdocs across China (Figure 1) to reflect on their own experience seeking an academic position: Puxian Xiong (P.X.), Mengyi Li (M.L.), Jianye Gao (J.G.), and Suting Weng (S.W.). We asked the same set of questions as the previous year’s cohort, and hope you find their replies just as insightful! P.X.: From 2012 to 2016, I studied at Shandong University (Jinan, China) majoring in Materials Science and Engineering, and finally I got my bachelor’s degree in engineering in June 2016. During that time, from September 2013 to June 2014, I studied at Central South University (Changsha, China) majoring in Materials Physics as an exchange undergraduate student. From 2016 to 2021, I studied at South China University of Technology (SCUT, Guangzhou, China) with quite broad research topics, from structural research of concrete to efficiency research of perovskite solar cells and finally to inorganic luminescent materials (crystals, glass, and optical fibers). I obtained my PhD in Luminescence Physics in 2021. Since 2021, I have been working as a postdoctoral assistant researcher at the State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices of South China University of Technology, where I continue to focus on research of inorganic luminescent materials, especially mechanoluminescence (ML, a kind of luminescence usually from a solid material under external mechanical stimuli such as compression, tension, or friction force). M.L.: I earned my bachelor’s degree in Polymer Materials and Engineering from Nanchang University, followed by a master’s degree in Physical Chemistry from Jinan University in China. Subsequently, I pursued my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Germany, completing it in 2020. Upon returning to China, I searched for positions for a period and secured a position at a research institute in Shanghai. However, in the end, I declined the offer. Currently, I am serving as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemistry and Engineering at Tongji University in Shanghai, collaborating with Prof. Tong Wu. J.G.: I completed my BS and MS in Power Engineering and Engineering Thermophysics at Northeastern University (Shenyang, China). After obtaining my master’s degree in January 2018, I was fortunate enough to secure the opportunity to pursue my PhD at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Since the doctoral program officially starts in September, I worked as a Research Fellow at Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, CAS (TIPC, CAS) in the group of Jing Liu (a jointly appointed professor at TIPC, CAS and Tsinghua University) for about eight months. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, working with Prof. Jing Liu. S.W.: I earned my bachelor’s degree in Powder Materials Science and Engineering from the Powder Metallurgy Research Institute at Central South University in 2018. During my undergraduate studies, I joined Prof. Libao Chen’s group, focused on the development of energy-storage materials, partially because I was quite good at electrochemistry (at least I thought I was), and I thought it was quite cool to actually be able to make some novel batteries as well. After that, I survived my PhD in Condensed Matter Physics at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Xuefeng Wang. And now, just getting along with this academic life a bit further, I am a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Wang’s group. P.X.: Nowadays, I am focusing on the research of near-infrared (NIR, 600–1700 nm) ML materials. As a kind of novel energy conversion material, ML materials can convert mechanical energy into light energy in situ and in real time, which is expected to attract much attention (in intelligent human-computer interaction, flexible displays, and passive lighting, etc.) as a new type of mechanical energy-sensing material. One must know that NIR lights can penetrate biological tissues to a certain extent and have been used in various fields such as biological imaging and detection. Therefore, we want to develop such a tissue-penetrating NIR ML material to achieve in situ, real-time in vitro monitoring of stress information in organisms. Even though it seems quite hard at present, we are currently working on all aspects of material design and development, mechanism discussion, and application exploration. In addition, I am also quite interested in ultraviolet and visible spectral band ML materials, especially the development of some new applications (anti-counterfeiting, sterilization, etc.), which always makes me quite excited. M.L.: My research area focuses on the development of stimuli-responsive materials with a specific emphasis on advancing targeted drug delivery systems for diverse disease treatments. Specifically, I investigated the use of stimuli-responsive polymers and nanoparticles to achieve spatiotemporal control over drug release, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. My work aligns with the evolving landscape of precision medicine, where the goal is to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. J.G.: My research interests mainly focus on liquid metal advanced materials, especially aiming at uncovering their practical values in thermal management, soft electronics, biomedical applications, soft robotics, and catalysis. As a doctoral student, I dedicated my research to fundamental theories and pioneered the development of a novel 4D porous liquid metal material system. I analyzed the feasibility and key mechanisms involved in preparing such materials and devised and implemented various techniques for their fabrications, including the capsule stacking method, the chemical foaming method, and the electrochemical sintering and foaming synergistic method, as well as the additive manufacturing method. Furthermore, I explored the multifunctional properties of 4D porous liquid metal materials and their diverse prospects for applications. For my postdoctoral research, I am working on hydrous liquid metals, especially for their biotissue-like rhythmic behaviors. S.W.: My current research focuses on employing cryogenic electron microscopy to study beam-sensitive materials, with a primary emphasis on investigating the structure and mechanisms of energy-storage materials. In a way, the short-term research project I did on the energy-storage materials inspired me to carry on with this. Specifically, I am deeply engaged in exploring graphite, a crucial anode material in commercial lithium-ion batteries. My research aims to unravel the staging structure and transition of Li-intercalated/deintercalated graphite and provide understanding of the sluggish reaction kinetics to boost the fast-charging performance of graphite anodes. Recently, I am developing further investigations of the evolution of interphase formation in anode materials and Li+ transport in lithium-ion batteries under varying operating conditions, including temperatures, pressures, charge and discharge rates, and other factors. These studies contribute significantly to the understanding of failure mechanisms and principles for enhancing the performance of lithium-ion batteries. My postdoctoral work involves developing more advanced electron microscopy techniques for tackling such problems in energy-storage materials and gaining new insights into the structural evolution and reaction mechanisms in this system. P.X.: Actually, it took quite a long time for me to make a decision to be a possible scientific researcher. When I was about to graduate as an undergraduate, I was almost 22 years old, and I had no idea what I wanted to do in the future. Due to the poor job market, I chose to go to graduate school and successfully entered SCUT in 3 months. Here, I experienced the most difficult 7 years of my life (so far). I covered quite a broad range of research topics, from structural research of concrete to research of perovskite solar cell efficiency and finally to inorganic ML materials. I also had to change mentors and even schools a few times. I wanted to give up more than once until I met a lot of teachers who were good to me during my PhD period, especially my two PhD supervisors (Professor Peng and Professor Yang): the former taught me how to quickly enter a field and find innovative points in scientific research, and the latter taught me to think about problems from an overall perspective. My career plan began to change. I fell in love with scientific research and hoped to explore the unknown world. I enjoy the uncertainty brought by the unknown and the sense of accomplishment of figuring out the possible reasons for the unknown. This feeling is like two teachers have planted the seed of a dream deep in my heart, and I decided to cultivate it carefully and slowly. This kind of thinking even affects every aspect of my life, which makes me always choose an uncertain path. M.L.: Ten years ago, as a college student, my teacher introduced the world’s renowned universities and research institutions in materials research, including the Max Planck Institute. Back then, I could not have imagined that I would eventually find myself there. As a graduate student, my research project faced obstacles, and progress was not smooth. After extensive literature reviews, I successfully synthesized the target product, which went on to be utilized in numerous projects within my laboratory. This experience bolstered my belief in my problem-solving abilities and fueled my aspirations to advance further in the realm of scientific research. Fortunately, my application for a PhD at the Max Planck Institute was successful. Throughout my PhD journey, my scientific thinking and capabilities underwent significant enhancement. I thoroughly enjoyed engaging in discussions with my supervisor, Prof. Katharina Landfester, a highly distinguished female scientist renowned for her exceptional achievements in miniemulsion technology. She serves as an inspiring role model, embodying the professional I aspire to become. Even more fortuitously, during my postdoctoral period, I have had the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. Tong Wu. His affirmation and guidance on my projects ensured that my work progressed in the right direction. J.G.: Before going to college, I never even though about becoming a teacher. But things changed during the summer of my sophomore year. I joined a volunteer project to teach at a school in the remote mountains. That experience really ignited my passion for education. Witnessing the children’s thirst for knowledge made me truly understand the importance and value of being an educator. Since then, I’ve seriously considered pursuing a teaching career. After graduating from university, I decided to continue my studies and delve deeper into research. To obtain more teaching experience and qualifications, I participated in various teaching trainings and academic activities organized by Tsinghua University for young faculty members. I believe that combining our research achievements with teaching may offer students unique educational experiences and greatly benefit their academic and professional development. I believe the enthusiasm and dedication will make me an outstanding educator. S.W.: Approximately nine years ago, during the early years of my undergrad, I first thought about going for a faculty role. This decision was influenced by a myriad of factors and experiences. A pivotal catalyst was my interactions with the lecturers and professors in my university who not only illustrated the rewards and challenges of pursuing academia but also imparted their profound passion for teaching and research. Their experiences resonated deeply with me, inspiring my foray into scientific research. Upon embarking on my PhD journey, my initial aspirations to make a substantial contribution to my field were met with the stark realities of numerous challenges and failures. The setbacks led me to doubt my suitability for a career in research. However, as I completed my PhD in June this year, I found myself at a crossroads, torn between continuing in research or pursuing other possibilities. It was at this juncture that my supervisor, Prof. Xuefeng Wang, offered invaluable advice: “It’s challenging to persist in a job you don’t enjoy; you need to contemplate what you want to do, not just what you can do.” I would say that was the triggering moment that led me to step back and look at the bigger picture. Following careful consideration, I chose to embark on my postdoctoral research journey. Furthermore, the successful publication of my doctoral research this year provided a significant boost of encouragement. These experiences solidified my steadfast aspiration to pursue a faculty role. P.X.: No, this is the first time I have started looking for a job. Officially, my postdoctoral contract will expire in July 2024. During my postdoc period, I tried to apply for funding, led students to design projects from beginning to end, and tried to think about problems as a mentor. In the past two years, I have applied for 4 funding grants, published 42 papers as the corresponding author, served on the youth editorial board of several journals, and led some students to win various honors such as national scholarships. At this moment, I feel that I am ready to truly join the workforce as a young teacher. M.L.: In fact, after completing my PhD, I actively sought a position in the university. My primary desire was to relocate to Shanghai. Notably, Shanghai’s university recruitment standards were comparatively higher than those in other cities. I secured a lecturer position at a research institute in Shanghai. I investigated various aspects of the institute, such as fund applications, experimental equipment, the professional development of staff hired in previous years, and salary structures. After careful consideration, I concluded that it wasn’t an ideal match for me. As a result, I declined the offer and opted to pursue a postdoctoral position instead. J.G.: This is my first time pursuing a faculty position, for which I have been preparing throughout my entire graduate career as well as my current doctoral studies. At this stage, I actively engage in searching for and discerning academic job opportunities online. Once I identify desired faculty positions in universities or research institutes, I reach out through emails or phone calls to inquire about potential opportunities and then closely keep up with their official announcements. Apart from academic positions, I am also considering exploring job interviews aligned with my interests. The most profound realization is that securing an academic position necessitates not only exceptional talent and proactive efforts but also fortunate circumstances. Job hunting is indeed a time-consuming endeavor; perhaps most postdocs, like myself, aspire for a quick settlement so that we can wholeheartedly dedicate ourselves to scientific research. S.W.: No, given the heightened competitiveness of faculty positions in today’s academic environment, I’ve chosen to take a strategic approach to my career. Having recently obtained my PhD this year, I’ve decided to embark on postdoctoral research. This allows me to accrue valuable experience and transferable project managing skills, engage in diverse research projects, and produce representative works. My aim is to thoroughly prepare myself before actively pursuing a faculty position. P.X.: ML is a new type of energy conversion technology that can display mechanical energy in situ and in real time as three-dimensional imaging in the form of light energy. However, the mechanism of ML is difficult to unify. A large number of scholars believe that it is related to defects, and so do we. Recently, we have been particularly interested in defect type, concentration, and distribution and the structure-activity relationship between these factors and ML properties. We hope to be able to clarify the deep physical mechanism of luminescence behind it as soon as possible so that we can design a material from the bottom up and further expand the practical applications of ML materials. M.L.: My future research area is to create accurate nanocarriers that respond to physiological cues, such as specific enzymes. I am investigating the use of stimuli-responsive polymers and nanoparticles to achieve spatiotemporal control over drug release, especially in the context of cancer treatment. On the other hand, I am also developing stimuli-responsive materials tailored for gene delivery with a focus on optimizing the release of genetic payloads under specific cellular conditions. I want to contribute to advancements in gene therapy by designing materials capable of responding to intracellular cues, enabling targeted and efficient delivery of genetic material. J.G.: Currently, intelligent materials are gradually evolving into a strategic frontier and a global hotspot, owing to their increasingly prominent scientific and industrial values. Liquid metal, as an emerging type of intelligent material, has demonstrated its immense potential in diverse fields such as soft robots, flexible electronics, biomedical applications, thermal management, and catalysis. In terms of the material itself, liquid metal encompasses a wealth of substance science that can serve as inspiration and provide exemplary models for the advancement of other disciplines. The exploration of liquid metal intelligent materials research may hold the promise to propel cutting-edge national technology forward while simultaneously creating boundless opportunities for new industries. S.W.: My proposed area of research focuses on employing advanced characterization methods to delve into the structural evolution and reaction mechanisms of energy-storage materials. I hold a particular interest in exploring solid-liquid interfacial reactions and investigating battery failure mechanisms. Advanced characterization methodologies facilitate in-depth studies of the properties and behaviors of materials, systems, or phenomena. P.X.: From my limited experience in looking for a job, I am concerned about the current form of employment, especially in Guangzhou, where I am located, a first-tier city in China. In recent years, many foreign scholars have returned to China to look for jobs, causing the job requirements to rise. Moreover, the assessment system of promotion or resignation is now popular, and the assessment indicators set are often ridiculously high. Young scholars are not given many opportunities to choose. You have to say that the possibility of finding a suitable place and concentrating on producing good results is not too high. M.L.: Recently, the term “rat race” has gained popularity in Chinese society, and this phenomenon extends to the job market. China’s universities are categorized into Project 985 universities, Project 211 universities, and other regular universities (note that the 985/211 designation was nullified in 2016 and replaced by the Double First Class University Plan in 2017, but the names are still used colloquially). The 39 Project 985 universities typically have higher recruitment standards and often offer six-year tenure-track contracts. Employees undergo assessment in the third year of the contract, and only those who have passed the assessment can continue to be employed for another three years. Recruitment standards are generally higher in first-tier cities like Beijing or Shanghai. Some Project 211 universities (of the 116 total) in these cities even surpass the recruitment standards of remote 985 universities. Additionally, recruitment requirements vary among different disciplines, with popular fields like computer science facing more intense competition. As postdocs, our strategy involves putting in extra effort to achieve better results, aiming to gain a competitive edge in the job market. J.G.: Nowadays, the competition for research positions is becoming fierce due to the ever-growing number of highly educated graduates in China. Additionally, more and more Chinese students studying overseas repatriate for employment opportunities. As a result, candidate evaluation has become more comprehensive and discerning in universities and research institutions, necessitating candidates to possess elevated qualities and skills to stand out. We need to foster a positive mindset in seizing opportunities and continuously augment our abilities and competitiveness. This may include engaging in continuous learning and further education, participating in internships and projects, and accumulating extensive work experience and interpersonal relationships. Additionally, establishing and maintaining a personal brand to showcase our specific expertise or skills enables us to stand out in fierce competition. S.W.: In my research area, the job market is fiercely competitive, characterized by a limited number of faculty positions relative to the abundance of qualified candidates. This high level of competition is propelled by factors such as the increasing number of PhD graduates and a growing interest in academic careers. While securing a position in prestigious universities and institutes poses significant challenges, numerous ordinary scientific research platforms are available in China. Despite the hurdles, I am holding an optimistic and proactive mind. I consistently refine my application materials and actively seek feedback from advisors in anticipation of finding potential opportunities. P.X.: To be honest when answering the questions, I have not specifically submitted my resume to any schools. At present, I am taking advantage of the opportunity of project meetings to visit and study various platforms. I want to first have a rough idea of what these platforms can bring to my future career development before I submit my resume. My academic background and achievements are relatively good, and there are currently some platforms that have given me opportunities. But now I have no interviews. Haha, maybe when you read this article, I will have started to be interviewed! M.L.: In reality, my options are somewhat limited since I’ve concentrated solely on universities in Shanghai, totaling around 5 institutions. As of now, I haven’t submitted my resume. I consistently inquire about the recruitment landscape from teachers employed at other universities. It’s undeniable that I’m confronting intense competition. However, I believe this process will be much smoother than when I was searching for positions after completing my PhD, as my academic achievements and capabilities have significantly improved. My primary goal is to stay in the current research group at Tongji University, which is also a 985 university. Of course, many universities are now avoiding academic “inbreeding” and seldom hire their own postdoctoral students. So there is also a possibility for me to go out and become a principal investigator. In addition, considering the challenging scenario, I am contemplating broadening my scope to include cities in proximity to Shanghai, such as Hangzhou and Nanjing. This expansion of choices aims to increase my opportunities to secure a position. J.G.: I am currently applying for faculty positions at two universities and a research institute affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. As of now, I have published over 40 academic papers, applied for 8 invention patents (with half already granted), and accumulated solid practical experience in projects. During my postdoctoral period, I successfully obtained funding from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation. Furthermore, my research focuses on current hot topics and frontiers that most universities find intriguing. I have a great passion for my research and believe it could be a strong asset; however, I haven’t received any interview invitations yet. I will continue to be proactive and take initiative in hopes of receiving a prompt response. S.W.: My aspiration is to pursue a position as an associate researcher at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and I am diligently putting in the effort to increase my chances. Additionally, I have listed several institutions that align closely with my research interests and overall career goals, and I am in the process of tailoring my application materials to effectively showcase how my research and teaching align with the specific requirements and values of each institution. Currently, I am actively preparing my application, confident that it will lead to an interview opportunity soon! P.X.: I know that the following points may be critical when looking for a job: (1) published academic papers; (2) your academic background; and (3) research project experience. Therefore, since I have no obvious shortcomings in these three aspects, I will highlight these three points. Of course, if the group I want to go to is close to the direction of my mentors, I will write down the names of my mentors, because they are indeed very outstanding seniors in our field. If they contact my mentors, it means that I at least have a chance, and we know that chance will not always exist, which I hope will help me find a suitable position. M.L.: During my postdoctoral stage, I focused on honing my abilities in fund application, laboratory management, and student supervision. I believe these skills distinguish the postdoctoral phase from the doctoral stage, as we have limited opportunities to develop these capabilities during the doctoral period. I believe showcasing these three proficiencies is crucial. These abilities demonstrate that I’m a highly competent researcher and will bring valuable contributions to your new team. Furthermore, given the current trend in many universities requiring English teaching, I will emphasize my proficiency in English. Additionally, I plan to introduce collaborative projects, as partnerships established in these endeavors can potentially lead to continued cooperation in the future. J.G.: According to an ancient Chinese proverb, “Knowing oneself and the enemy leads to victory in a hundred battles.” I firmly believe that it is of utmost importance to fully comprehend the requirements and expectations of the position. Building upon this understanding, we should thoroughly delve into and showcase our research findings and academic contributions and teaching proficiency and experience, as well as educational background and professional expertise. The last point, often overlooked, is to meticulously organize our application materials and present them in a clear, well-structured, and professional manner. This ensures coherence, readability, and error-free content, thereby improving the quality of our application materials and increasing our competitiveness in academic job competitions. S.W.: In preparing my application package, I focused on how my unique background and research area aligned with the requirements of the positions I was applying for. I organized my curriculum vitae and research statement well to highlight key findings, publications, grants, and pertinent professional experiences. These will underscore not only my research capabilities but also the significance of my work and its potential contributions to the field.
