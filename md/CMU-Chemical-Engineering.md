Abstract. Aerosols influence fog properties such as visibility and lifetime by affecting fog droplet number concentrations (Nd). Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models often represent aerosol–fog interactions using highly simplified approaches. Incorporating prognostic size-resolved aerosol microphysics from climate models could allow them to simulate Nd and aerosol–fog interactions without incurring excessive computational expense. However, microphysics code designed for coarse spatial resolution may struggle with sub-kilometer-scale grid spacings. Here, we test the ability of the UK Met Office Unified Model to simulate aerosol and fog properties during case studies from the ParisFog field campaign in 2011. We examine the sensitivity of fog properties to variations in Nd caused by modifications to simulated aerosol activation. Our model, with a 500 m horizontal resolution and interactive aerosol and cloud microphysics, significantly underpredicts Nd, although it only slightly underestimates the cloud condensation nuclei concentration. With an updated version of the Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (2000) activation scheme, we produce Nd that are more consistent with those predicted by a cloud parcel model under fog-like conditions. We activate droplets only by adiabatic cooling. We incorporate more realistic hygroscopicities for sulfate and organic aerosols and explore the sensitivity of simulated Nd to unresolved updrafts. We find that both Nd and simulated fog liquid water content are very sensitive to the updated activation scheme but remain less affected by the update to hygroscopicities. Our improvements offer insights into the physical processes regulating Nd in stable conditions, potentially laying foundations for improved operational fog forecasts that incorporate interactive aerosol simulations or aerosol climatologies.

Abstract. Aerosol–fog interactions affect the visibility in, and life cycle of, fog and are difficult to represent in weather and climate models. Here we explore processes that impact the simulation of fog droplet number concentrations (Nd) at sub-kilometer scale horizontal grid resolutions in the UK Met Office Unified Model. We modify the parameterization of aerosol activation to include droplet activation by radiative cooling in addition to adiabatic cooling and determine the relative importance of the two cooling mechanisms. We further test the sensitivity of simulated Nd to: (a) interception of droplets by trees and buildings, (b) overestimation of updrafts in temperature inversions (which leads to artificially high Nd values), and (c) potential mechanisms for droplet deactivation due to downward fluctuations in supersaturation. We evaluate our model against observations from the ParisFog and LANFEX field campaigns, building on evaluation described in the companion paper. Including radiative cooling in the activation mechanism improves how accurately we represent the liquid water path and the vertical structure of the fog in our LANFEX case study. However, with radiative cooling, the Nd are overestimated for most of the ParisFog cases and for the LANFEX case. The time-averaged overestimate exceeds a factor of three (the normalized mean bias factor exceeds 2.0) in 4 out of 11 ParisFog cases. Our sensitivity studies demonstrate how these overestimates can be mitigated. Assuming the overestimate affects both radiative and adiabatic cooling, we find that although radiative cooling is more often the dominant source, both cooling sources can sometimes dominate activation.

Abstract Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However, GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge, we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across several Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold dataset. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning strategies.

Multiple parafoil landing is an enabling technology for massive supply delivery missions. However, it is still an open question to design a collision-free, computation-efficient guidance and control method for unpowered parafoils. To address this issue, this paper proposes a coordinated guidance and control method for multiple parafoil landing. First, the multiple parafoil landing process is formulated as a trajectory optimization problem. Then, the landing point allocation algorithm is designed to assign the landing point to each parafoil. In order to guarantee flight safety, the collision-free trajectory replanning algorithm is designed. On this basis, the nonlinear model predictive control algorithm is adapted to leverage the nonlinear dynamics model for trajectory tracking. Finally, the parafoil kinematic model is utilized to reduce the computational burden of trajectory calculation, and kinematic model is updated by the moving horizon correction algorithm to improve the trajectory accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed coordinated guidance and control method for the multiple parafoil landing.

Abstract Isoprene (C 5 H 8 ) is the non-methane hydrocarbon with the highest emissions to the atmosphere. It is mainly produced by vegetation, especially broad-leaved trees, and efficiently transported to the upper troposphere in deep convective clouds, where it is mixed with lightning NO x . Isoprene oxidation products drive rapid formation and growth of new particles in the tropical upper troposphere. However, isoprene oxidation pathways at low temperatures are not well understood. Here, in experiments at the CERN CLOUD chamber at 223 K and 243 K, we find that isoprene oxygenated organic molecules (IP-OOM) all involve two successive $${{{\rm{OH}}}}^{\bullet}$$    OH   ∙    oxidations. However, depending on the ambient concentrations of the termination radicals ( $${{{{\rm{HO}}}}_{2}}^{\bullet},\,{{{\rm{NO}}}}^{\bullet}$$      HO   2     ∙   ,    NO   ∙    , and $${{{\rm{NO}}}}_{2}^{\bullet}$$    NO   2   ∙    ), vastly-different IP-OOM emerge, comprising compounds with zero, one or two nitrogen atoms. Our findings indicate high IP-OOM production rates for the tropical upper troposphere, mainly resulting in nitrate IP-OOM but with an increasing non-nitrate fraction around midday, in close agreement with aircraft observations.
