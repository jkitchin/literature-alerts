Abstract Magnetic materials play a crucial role in the transition to more sustainable forms of energy and electric vehicles. There is an anticipated shortage in magnetic materials in the future, and as a result there is an urgent need to discover and design new magnetic materials. Computational magnetic material design using density functional theory is daunting because of the challenge in identifying magnetic ground states from a combinatorially large set of possibilities. Machine learning offers a path forward by enabling efficient surrogate models that can more readily enumerate these states, but there is a dearth of training data available, and what is available tends to be imbalanced with too much non-magnetic data. In this work we show that the discrete and previously tackled data imbalance that exists at the level of the magnetic ordering leads to an imbalanced continuous distribution with many zeros when the data is unraveled at the atomic magnetic moment level, which subsequently leads to models with low accuracy for magnetic properties. We mitigate this by using a two-part model framework. Our scheme is able to classify atoms into magnetic and non-magnetic with an F1 score and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of $\sim$ 91 \% and then to provide an implicit embedding representation that maps directly onto the magnitude of the magnetic moment with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1 $\mu_{\text{B}}$. Beyond screening for new magnetic materials, we demonstrate an additional practical use case of our scheme: the provision of good initial guesses for magnetic moments in first-principles electronic relaxations. Such initialization is shown to lead to faster convergence to configurations that lie closer to the ground state.

Recent data has characterized human milk cells with unprecedented detail and provided insight into cell populations. While such analysis of freshly expressed human milk has been possible, studies of cell functionality within the infant have been limited to animal models. One commonly used animal model for milk research is the mouse; however, limited data are available describing the composition of mouse milk. In particular, the maternal cells of mouse milk have not been previously characterized in detail, in part due to the difficulty in collecting sufficient volumes of mouse milk. In this study, we have established a method to collect high volumes of mouse milk, isolate cells, and compare the cell counts and types to human milk. Surprisingly, we found that mouse milk cell density is three orders of magnitude higher than human milk. The cell types present in the milk of mice and humans are similar, broadly consisting of mammary epithelial cells and immune cells. These results provide a basis of comparison for mouse and human milk cells and will inform the most appropriate uses of mouse models for the study of human phenomena.

This manuscript presents a complete framework for the development and verification of physics-informed neural networks with application to the alternating-current power flow (ACPF) equations. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN)s have received considerable interest within power systems communities for their ability to harness underlying physical equations to produce simple neural network architectures that achieve high accuracy using limited training data. The methodology developed in this work builds on existing methods and explores new important aspects around the implementation of PINNs including: (i) obtaining operationally relevant training data, (ii) efficiently training PINNs and using pruning techniques to reduce their complexity, and (iii) globally verifying the worst-case predictions given known physical constraints. The methodology is applied to the IEEE-14 and 118 bus systems where PINNs show substantially improved accuracy in a data-limited setting and attain better guarantees with respect to worst-case predictions.

The need for rapid and widespread deployment of new technologies to address climate change goals (e.g., deep, economy-wide decarbonization) presents new opportunities for advancing modular design strategies. Conventional engineering approaches focus on unique designs for each installation, while missing opportunities for manufacturing standardization. Extending insights from the automotive industry, we optimize a platform of common unit module designs while simultaneously designing an entire family of process variants that make use of that platform. This reduces engineering effort, deployment timelines, and manufacturing costs. We propose a nonlinear generalized disjunctive programming formulation and convert this to an efficient mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation through discretization of the design space. We formulate our optimization in Pyomo with costing from IDAES, and we demonstrate the computational performance and solution quality on a water treatment desalination system from the PARETO framework and a carbon capture system built in Aspen PlusÂ® as part of CCSI2.
