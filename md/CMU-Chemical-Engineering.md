We introduce a new method to estimate the mass concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) collected on quartz filters, demonstrating it using quartz-filter samples collected in greater Pittsburgh. This method combines thermal-optical organic carbon and elemental carbon (OC/EC) analysis and the volatility basis set (VBS) to quantify the mass concentration of semi-volatile POC on the filters. The dataset includes ambient samples collected at a number of sites in both summer and winter as well as samples from a highway tunnel. As a reference we use the two-filter bare-Quartz minus Quartz-Behind-Teflon (Q-QBT) approach to estimate the adsorbed gaseous fraction of organic carbon (OC), finding a substantial fraction in both the gas and particle phases under all conditions. In the new method we use OC fractions measured during different temperature stages of the OC/EC analysis for the single bare-quartz (BQ) filter in combination with partitioning theory to predict the volatility distributions of the measured OC, which we describe with the VBS. The effective volatility bins are consistent for data from both ambient samples and primary organic aerosol (POA)-enriched tunnel samples. Consequently, with the VBS model and total OC fractions measured over different heating stages, particulate OC can be determined by using the BQ filter alone. This method can thus be applied to all quartz filter-based OC/EC analyses to estimate the POC concentration without using backup filters. © 2016 American Association for Aerosol Research

Abstract: ======= Transition metal dioxides (BO2) exhibit a number of polymorphic structures with distinct properties, but the isolation of different polymorphs for a given composition is carried out using trial and error experimentation. We present computational studies of the relative stabilities and equations of state for six polymorphs (anatase, brookite, rutile, columbite, pyrite, and fluorite) of five different BO2 dioxides (B = Ti, V, Ru, Ir, and Sn). These properties were computed in a consistent fashion using several exchange correlation functionals within the density functional theory formalism, and the effects of the different functionals are discussed relative to their impact on predictive synthesis. We compare the computational results to prior observations of high-pressure synthesis and epitaxial film growth and then use this discussion to predict new accessible polymorphs in the context of epitaxial stabilization using isostructural substrates. For example, the relative stabilities of the columbite polymorph for VO2 and RuO2 are similar to those of TiO2 and SnO2, the latter two of which have been previously stabilized as epitaxial films.
