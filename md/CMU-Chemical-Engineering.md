Abstract. Aerosols influence fog properties such as visibility and lifetime by affecting fog droplet number concentrations (Nd). Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models often represent aerosol-fog interactions using highly simplified approaches. Incorporating prognostic size-resolved aerosol microphysics from climate models could allow them to simulate Nd and aerosol-fog interactions without incurring excessive computational expense. However, microphysics code designed for coarse spatial resolution may struggle with sub-kilometer-scale grid spacings. Here we test the ability of the UK Met Office Unified Model to simulate aerosol and fog properties during case studies from the ParisFog field campaign in 2011. We examine the sensitivity of fog properties to variations in Nd caused by modifications to simulated aerosol activation. Our model with 500 m horizontal resolution and interactive aerosol and cloud microphysics significantly underpredicts Nd, although only slightly underestimates the cloud condensation nuclei concentration. With an updated version of the Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (2000) activation scheme, we produce Nd that are more consistent with those predicted by a cloud parcel model under fog-like conditions. We activate droplets only by adiabatic cooling. We incorporate more realistic hygroscopicities for sulfate and organic aerosols and explore the sensitivity of simulated Nd to unresolved updrafts. We find that both Nd and simulated fog liquid water content are very sensitive to the updated activation scheme but remain unaffected by the update to hygroscopicities. Our improvements offer insights into the physical processes regulating Nd in stable conditions, potentially laying foundations for improved operational fog forecasts that incorporate interactive aerosol simulations or aerosol climatologies.

Abstract. Accurate precipitation forecasting hinges on the representation of microphysical processes within numerical models. A key approach to understanding these processes is through the analysis of hydrometeor drop size distribution (DSD). The characteristics of DSD bulk parameters:-Mass Weighted Mean Diameter (Dm) and the Normalized Number Concentration parameter (Nw), are estimated from the double moment cloud microphysical scheme (CASIM: Cloud-Aerosol Interacting Microphysics) employed in the operational convection permitted model of National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Fore- casting (NCUM-R). The observations from the Joss-Valdvogel Disdrometer (JWD) and the Global Precipitation Mission – Dual Frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM-DPR) are analyzed for providing essential validation. An algorithm for separating the monsoon precipitation into convective and stratiform types in NCUM-R and a new parameter estimation module to obtain DSD parameters from the CASIM are established in the study. The model exhibits agreement with the characteristics of the DSD of raindrops with Dm ranging from 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm marking the majority of the monsoon precipitation events. However, the underestimation when it comes to the larger drops (with Dm > 3.25 mm and Rainrate >= 8 mm/hr) demands a reassessment in microphysical parameterizations. The advanced autoconversion parameterization scheme applied in CASIM favored the growth of large drops compared to the existing scheme. The enhanced growth of larger drops is reflected in the increased accuracy in the prediction of extreme precipitation associated with a convective event. The current study underscores the importance of refining microphysical parameterizations to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts offering a pathway for enhanced model performance in future operational forecasting systems.
