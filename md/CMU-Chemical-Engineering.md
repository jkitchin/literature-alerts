Abstract Multi-horizon stochastic programming includes short-term and long-term uncertainty in investment planning problems more efficiently than traditional multi-stage stochastic programming. In this paper, we exploit the block separable structure of multi-horizon stochastic linear programming, and establish that it can be decomposed by Benders decomposition and Lagrangean decomposition. In addition, we propose parallel Lagrangean decomposition with primal reduction that, (1) solves the scenario subproblems in parallel, (2) reduces the primal problem by keeping one copy for each scenario group at each stage, and (3) solves the reduced primal problem in parallel. We apply the parallel Lagrangean decomposition with primal reduction, Lagrangean decomposition and Benders decomposition to solve a stochastic energy system investment planning problem. The computational results show that: (a) the Lagrangean type decomposition algorithms have better convergence at the first iterations to Benders decomposition, and (b) parallel Lagrangean decomposition with primal reduction is very efficient for solving multi-horizon stochastic programming problems. Based on the computational results, the choice of algorithms for multi-horizon stochastic programming is discussed.

Determining the optimal configuration of adsorbates on a slab (adslab) is pivotal in the exploration of novel catalysts across diverse applications. Traditionally, the quest for the lowest energy adslab configuration involves placing the adsorbate onto the slab followed by an optimization process. Prior methodologies have relied on heuristics, problem-specific intuitions, or brute-force approaches to guide adsorbate placement. In this work, we propose a novel framework for adsorbate placement using denoising diffusion. The model is designed to predict the optimal adsorbate site and orientation corresponding to the lowest energy configuration. Further, we have an end-to-end evaluation framework where diffusion-predicted adslab configuration is optimized with a pretrained machine learning force field and finally evaluated with Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our findings demonstrate an acceleration of up to 5x or 3.5x improvement in accuracy compared to the previous best approach. Given the novelty of this framework and application, we provide insights into the impact of pre-training, model architectures, and conduct extensive experiments to underscore the significance of this approach.

The optimization of chemical processes is challenging due to the nonlinearities arising from process physics and discrete design decisions. In particular, optimal synthesis and design of chemical processes can be posed as a Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) superstructure problem. Various solution methods are available to address these problems, such as reformulating them as Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems; nevertheless, algorithms explicitly designed to solve the GDP problem and potentially leverage its structure remain scarce. This paper presents the Logic-based Discrete-Steepest Descent Algorithm (LD-SDA) as a solution method for GDP problems involving ordered Boolean variables. The LD-SDA reformulates these ordered Boolean variables into integer decisions called external variables. The LD-SDA solves the reformulated GDP problem using a two-level decomposition approach where the upper-level subproblem determines external variable configurations. Subsequently, the remaining continuous and discrete variables are solved as a subproblem only involving those constraints relevant to the given external variable arrangement, effectively taking advantage of the structure of the GDP problem. The advantages of LD-SDA are illustrated through a batch processing case study, a reactor superstructure, a distillation column, and a catalytic distillation column, and its open-source implementation is available online. The results show convergence efficiency and solution quality improvements compared to conventional GDP and MINLP solvers.

An experimental and theoretical study of module collar design is presented here. Hollow fiber membranes are prepared by dip coating a poly(vinylidene) (PVDF) support with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gutter layer and a Pebax 2533 selective layer. Fiber bundles with a well-defined fiber packing are prepared using a 3D printed module. A parallel fiber bundle consisting of 4-9 uniformly spaced fibers is created with printed tabs that align the fibers and create a tubesheet. The tabs are sealed within a printed case that possesses a series of external ports for gas introduction and removal. Uniquely, both port location and the use of a collar to assist fluid distribution in the shell can be varied for the same fiber bundle. Experimental measurements are compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The experimental module design allows high-fidelity representation of the fiber bundle and module case in the simulations. Comparisons between experiment and simulation are in good agreement over a broad range of experimental conditions. The detrimental effect of having ports located too close, leading to stagnation regions, is captured as well as the beneficial effects of using a collar for shell-side fluid distribution around the fiber bundle. Such results help validate the use of CFD to develop high-performance module designs.

Optimal management and desalination of produced water is a major challenge for U.S. oil and gas development. Integrating rigorous desalination models into multi-period produced water network optimization problems presents several hurdles, which need to be tackled using advanced optimization strategies. In this work, a novel multi-period produced water network formulation with separate solid and liquid flows is introduced to avoid singularities at zero flows. Rigorous steady state desalination models based on mechanical vapor recompression are embedded at the desalination sites in the network model. An integrated optimization formulation is developed to co-optimize the design of desalination units along with the operation of the network. Furthermore, a more robust approach based on the trust region filter method is developed to efficiently integrate complex desalination models into the multi-period planning problem. Both optimization approaches are demonstrated on a produced water network from the PARETO library (Drouven et al., 2022) using thermal desalination units. Our results show that while the TRF and integrated approaches have comparable solve times, the TRF approach has better performance reliability in terms of solver convergence. Furthermore, the optimal solution obtained by embedding rigorous models into the network is significantly different than when desalination costs are approximated using simple cost models, which motivates further research in this field.
