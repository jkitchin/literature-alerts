Inverse problems, where we seek the values of inputs to a model that lead to a desired set of outputs, are a challenges subset of problems in science and engineering. In this work we demonstrate the use of two generative AI methods to solve inverse problems. We compare this approach to two more conventional approaches that use a forward model with nonlinear programming, and the use of a backward model. We illustrate each method on a dataset obtained from a simple remote instrument that has three inputs: the setting of the red, green and blue channels of an RGB LED. We focus on several outputs from a light sensor that measures intensity at 445 nm, 515 nm, 590 nm, and 630 nm. The specific problem we solve is identifying inputs that lead to a specific intensity in three of those channels. We show that generative models can be used to solve this kind of inverse problem, and they have some advantages over the conventional approaches.

Controlling chemical reactions at interfaces is central to many fields, including atmospheric, environmental, and biological chemistry as well as catalysis and corrosion. We performed a fundamental study of how catalytically active Rh atoms placed at and above a molecule-metal interface influence the surface reaction kinetics of tartaric acid (TA) decomposition. Specifically, TA decomposition on Cu(100) exhibits autocatalytic decomposition kinetics involving a slow initiation step followed by fast decomposition of the molecular layer. These so-called "surface explosions" are extremely sensitive to initial conditions, making it fundamentally interesting to study how the placement of reactive atoms affects the reaction rate. Temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) experiments reveal that Rh atoms embedded in the Cu(100) surface beneath TA (TA/Rh/Cu) or atop the TA layer (Rh/TA/Cu) reduce the decomposition temperature and modify the reaction rate constants. Isothermal TPR analysis reveals that Rh enhances both the initiation rate constant, ki, and the explosion rate constant, ke, facilitating explosive decomposition at lower temperatures. This result provides evidence that both the initiation and explosion steps occur at the metal-molecule interface and are accelerated by the presence of Rh at this interface. This study illustrates how small amounts of reactive elements may be used to control nonlinear kinetic processes at interfaces.
