Abstract Integration of Bayesian parameter estimation (BPE) with model‐based design of experiments (MBDoE) aims to estimate process parameters efficiently and systematically. To achieve more efficient use of resources by iteratively selecting informative experiments based on current knowledge about the parameters, an integrated method with BPE and MBDoE is proposed in this article. A built‐in Markov Chain Monte Carlo is also developed to yield not only the distribution profile of the estimated parameters but also aid in the determination of stopping criteria and the estimation of noise. Two applications of dynamic batch reactor systems are presented. Comparative analysis substantiates the superior performance of this approach in terms of parameter accuracy and the efficiency of experimentation.

Abstract We address in this paper linear programming (LP) models in which it is desired to find a finite set of alternate optima. An LP may have multiple alternate solutions with the same objective value or with increasing objective values. For many real life applications, it can be interesting to have a pool of solutions to compare what operations should be executed and what is the cost/benefit of doing it. To obtain a specified number of these alternate solutions in the increasing order of objective values, we propose an iterative MILP algorithm in which we successively add integer cuts on inactive constraints. We demonstrate the application and effectiveness of this algorithm on a 2 dimensional LP and on small and large supply chain problems. The proposed iterative MILP algorithm provides an effective approach for finding a specified number of alternate optima in LP models, which provides a useful tool in a variety of applications as for instance in supply chain optimization problems.

Abstract We develop a two-timing perturbation analysis to provide quantitative insights on the existence of temporal ratchets in an exemplary system of a particle moving in a tank of fluid in response to an external vibration of the tank. We consider two-mode vibrations with angular frequencies $$\omega $$  ω  and $$\alpha \omega $$   α ω   , where $$\alpha $$  α  is a rational number. If $$\alpha $$  α  is a ratio of odd and even integers (e.g., $$\tfrac{2}{1},\,\tfrac{3}{2},\,\tfrac{4}{3}$$     2 1   ,    3 2   ,    4 3     ), the system yields a net response: here, a nonzero time-average particle velocity. Our first-order perturbation solution predicts the existence of temporal ratchets for $$\alpha =2$$   α = 2   . Furthermore, we demonstrate, for a reduced model, that the temporal ratcheting effect for $$\alpha =\tfrac{3}{2}$$   α =   3 2     and $$\tfrac{4}{3}$$    4 3    appears at the third-order perturbation solution. More importantly, we find closed-form formulas for the magnitude and direction of the induced net velocities for these $$\alpha $$  α  values. On a broader scale, our methodology offers a new mathematical approach to study the complicated nature of temporal ratchets in physical systems. Graphic abstract
