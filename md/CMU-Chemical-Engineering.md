Abstract. Criegee intermediates (CIs), forming from the ozonolysis of alkenes, are highly reactive species with diverse reaction pathways, with important roles in atmospheric chemistry. This study focuses on the formation of accretion products through reactions of thermally stabilized CIs (sCIs) from the ozonolysis of three different terpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene, and β-caryophyllene) with malonic and oxalic acids. Our experimental results demonstrate that these reactions efficiently produce the expected accretion products, though with apparent variations in yields depending on the specific terpene and acid involved. To our knowledge, these are the first direct gas-phase observations of expected adducts from terpene-derived sCIs and carboxylic acids, paving the way for a better understanding of the importance and atmospheric implications of these reactions, especially in terms of aerosol-forming capabilities of these large product molecules.

Access to the potential energy Hessian enables determination of the Gibbs free energy, and certain approaches to transition state search and optimization. Here, we demonstrate that off-the-shelf pretrained Open Catalyst Project (OCP) machine learned potentials (MLPs) determine the Hessian with great success (58 cm$^{-1}$ mean absolute error (MAE)) for intermediates adsorbed to heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. This enables the use of OCP models for the aforementioned applications. The top performing model, with a simple offset correction, gives good estimations of the vibrational entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy with an MAE of 0.042 eV at 300 K. The ability to leverage models to capture the translational entropy was also explored. It was determined that 94% of randomly sampled systems had a translational entropy greater than 0.1 eV at 300 K. This underscores the need to go beyond the harmonic approximation to consider the entropy introduced by adsorbate translation, which increases with temperature. Lastly, we used MLP determined Hessian information for transition state search and found we were able to reduce the number of unconverged systems by 65% to 93% overall convergence, improving on the baseline established by CatTSunami.

Molecular representation is a foundational element in our understanding of the physical world. Its importance ranges from the fundamentals of chemical reactions to the design of new therapies and materials. Previous molecular machine learning models have employed strings, fingerprints, global features, and simple molecular graphs that are inherently information-sparse representations. However, as the complexity of prediction tasks increases, the molecular representation needs to encode higher fidelity information. This work introduces a novel approach to infusing quantum-chemical-rich information into molecular graphs via stereoelectronic effects. We show that the explicit addition of stereoelectronic interactions significantly improves the performance of molecular machine learning models. Furthermore, stereoelectronics-infused representations can be learned and deployed with a tailored double graph neural network workflow, enabling its application to any downstream molecular machine learning task. Finally, we show that the learned representations allow for facile stereoelectronic evaluation of previously intractable systems, such as entire proteins, opening new avenues of molecular design.
