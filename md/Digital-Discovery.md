OpenAlex: https://openalex.org/W4405421036    
Open access: False
    
[Masahiko Taniguchi](https://openalex.org/A5066177154), [Jonathan S. Lindsey](https://openalex.org/A5083917347), Digital Discovery. None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.1039/d4dd00255e.
    
Spectra – the lifeblood of photochemistry – have been very difficult to find in the literature. Chatbots, remarkably, may enable their more efficient acquisition and prove to be generally powerful tools for searching the scientific literature.
