There is a growing interest in developing high-performance catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to address the increasingly serious impacts of global climate change. In this talk, we report on the design of Cu-based and Co-based bimetallic nanomaterials for the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . The morphology, composition and structure of the synthesized nanomaterials were characterized with various imaging and spectroscopic techniques, including FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, EDX and XPS. The effects of an applied potential on the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 were investigated using various electrochemical methods. The products generated from the CO 2 electrochemical reduction were identified by gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was also employed to monitor the activity of the catalysts and the CO 2 reduction products. The kinetics of the CO 2 reduction reaction at the nanomaterials was further studied using in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The critical roles of nanostructured surfaces in the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 are discussed.

Due to the escalating crisis of global warming, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion has garnered significant attention as a pivotal technology for sustainable energy and chemical processes. However, the challenge lies in its nature as a strong endothermic reaction with substantial activation energy, thus requiring extensive energy input. Therefore, integration with renewable energy sources becomes imperative. In this regard, Photo- and electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) presents promising avenues for converting CO 2 with water (H 2 O) using electricity derived from renewable sources, thereby producing various chemicals and fuels. However, the abundance of H 2 O in the catalytic microenvironment promotes the competing evolution of hydrogen (H 2 ), leading to diminished energy efficiency and selectivity toward CO 2 R products. Additionally, another challenge is to selectively produce valuable multicarbon products (C 2+ products), including C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 5 OH, and C 3 H 7 OH, which hold higher market value and greater market volume compared to single-carbon products (C 1 products) like HCOOH, CO, and CH 4 . Among various CO 2 R catalysts, Copper (Cu)-based materials have emerged as prominent candidates due to their capability to yield C 2+ products with considerable activity and selectivity. Recent studies suggest that catalytic microenvironments significantly influence C 2+ production on Cu-based catalysts. Hence, this presentation aims to elucidate the impact of these microenvironments near Cu catalysts and explore how this knowledge can be effectively applied to design a photocathode for the photo-electrochemical reduction of CO 2 , thereby enhancing the production of C 2+ products.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has the potential to play a key role in addressing major energy and environmental challenges via clean conversion of the atmospheric CO 2 from combusting of fossil fuels into value-added products such as fuels and chemicals. The products generated by CO 2 RR vary depending on the electrocatalyst used at the CO 2 electrolyzer cathode, 1 which calls for the development of more active, stable, and selective CO 2 RR electrocatalysts. Atomically dispersed Ni-N-C catalysts have attracted attention due to their superior selectivity for CO generation. 2 Their activity and selectivity towards CO 2 RR are influenced by the metal center and its local coordination environment in Ni-N-C catalysts. 3 Ni-N-C catalysts derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have multiple advantages including a high specific surface area, customizable pore structures, and controllable morphologies, even after the carbonization treatment at high temperatures. In this presentation, we will focus on ZIF-derived Ni-N-C catalysts using a ligand exchange strategy during ZIF synthesis. These ligand-exchanged ZIFs are synthesized by partially replacing 2-methylimidazole (used in ZIF-8 synthesis) with different imidazole-like ligands for the purpose of obtaining structures with increased porosity. The effects of several parameters, including ligand exchange percentage and pyrolysis temperature for synthesizing Ni-N-C catalysts will be evaluated. We will show how the physicochemical characteristics of the Ni-N-C catalyst, i.e., porosity, hydrophobicity, and density of active sites, can be tuned by varying the synthesis parameters. We will focus in particular on the optimization of porosity and accessibility of CO 2 to the catalyst’ active sites to maximize CO 2 RR rate.

Recent rise in the consumption of fossil fuels have raised the levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere causing global warming 1 . Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) to value-added chemicals at low temperature and ambient pressure using green renewable energy sources has emerged as a propitious technology to realize carbon neutrality and mitigate global warming 2 . Supramolecular assembly of noble metal nanoclusters (NMNC) is one of the alluring areas of modern material science. Nanocluster assemblies formed by integrating NMNC using a crosslinking ligand, are reported to be applied in various applications such as nanodevices and as luminescent sensor materials 3 . Silver nanocluster assemblies (Ag-CAM) are composed of regularly crosslinked silver nanoclusters 4 and were evaluated as cathodic electrocatalysts for CO2RR. In this study, we evaluated the reaction selectivity and structural stability of an Ag-CAM ([Ag 12 (StBu) 6 (CF3COO) 6 (2EB) 3 ] n ; Ag 12 -2EB) crosslinked by linker with triple bonds 5 when used as a cathode electrocatalyst (Figure 1). Synthesized Ag-CAMs were supported onto the surface of commercially available gas diffusion electrode (GDE) by spray coating method (Figure 2). The catalyst-loaded electrodes were attached to a self-fabricated GDE flow cell, and electrocatalytic properties were evaluated. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and Pt mesh was taken as the counter electrode for the electrochemical reactions. Single crystal-XRD and powder-XRD were measured to determine the exact crystal structure, while SEM-EDS was used to characterize the electrode surface to determine the structural stability. We used gas chromatography (GC) and 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to calculate the reaction selectivity and quantify the product concentration. The CO2RR products in outlet gas streams from the gas chamber and electrolytes from the catholyte room were analyzed using GC and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. For silver nanocluster assembly cross-linked with 4,4`-bipyridine ([Ag 12 (StBu) 8 (CF3COO) 4 (BPY) 4 ] n ; Ag 12 -BPY) most of the constituent elements of the aggregate (S, N, F, etc.) were eluted out after performing the electrochemical (EC) reactions up to a voltage of 3.2V. The catalyst structure underwent significant transformations and was confirmed by SEM-EDS analysis with samples before and after EC analysis. However, in EC experiments using Ag 12 -2EB as the cathode electrocatalyst, the structural decompositions were suppressed and the electrocatalyst could withstand long-term use. Figure 3 shows the Faraday selectivity (%) of CO2RR products against the applied potential for Ag 12 -2EB/GDE in 0.1M KHCO3. Carbon monoxide (CO) was the main product obtained from electrochemical CO 2 RR of Ag 12 -2EB and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) could be suppressed when the applied potential was shifted to the negative side. Additionally, regarding the reaction selectivity, it was found that the selectivity was approximately the same regardless of the structure of the crosslinking agent. Knowledge obtained from this study will help to bridge the gap for utilizing Ag-CAMs as novel cathode catalyst materials for electrochemical CO 2 RR experiments. References (1) Liu, Y. Y., Huang, J.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to highly value‐added C2+ fuels or chemicals is a promising pathway to address environment issues and energy crisis. In the periodic table, Cu as only the candidate can convert CO2 to C2+ products such as C2H4 and C2H5OH due to the suitable absorption energy to reaction intermediate. Application of Cu is limited for its low activity and poor selectivity. The tandem catalytic strategy can effectively solve the problems caused by single copper catalyst. In tandem catalysis, how to promote the formation, transport, adsorption and coupling of the important intermediate CO is the key issue to improve the selectivity of C2+ products. Regulating structure of Cu‐based bimetallic can effectively promote processes to Electrochemical CO2RR on account of its synergistic effect, electronic effect. In this review, we systematically summarized the relationship between structure of Cu‐based bimetallic catalysts with performance of electrochemical CO2RR. More importantly, we reveal that different Cu‐based bimetallic structures enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts by regulating the processes such as the transport and adsorption of reaction intermediate CO. We proposed well‐effective strategies to rationally design Cu‐based metallic catalysts. We put forward some challenges and opportunities that Cu‐based bimetallic catalysts in future.

We report on the growth and photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization of single crystal, epitaxial zinc telluride (ZnTe) thin film photocathodes. ZnTe is a II-VI semiconductor that has promising photocathode characteristics, including its suitable band gap alignments to CO 2 reduction potentials, chemical stability, strong p-type character, and is theorized to have surface sites suitable for CO 2 reduction. To gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental charge transport of the reactivity mechanism for ZnTe, we utilized molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow single crystal thin film photocathodes. This work focuses largely on the synthesis and characterization of degenerately-doped ZnTe films on three different gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate orientations: (100), (110), and (111)A. ZnTe thin films with a thickness of 300 nm, grown in the temperature range of 340–360ºC, were doped with nitrogen via an in situ RF plasma source and characterized by RHEED, XRD, AFM, and Hall effect measurements. The epitaxial films exhibited p-type characteristics with doping concentrations of 10 18 to 10 20 cm -3 . Photoelectrochemical stability and catalytic selectivity of the ZnTe photocathodes were investigated in a three-electrode compression cell in a CO 2 -saturated electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO 3 ). Utilizing degenerately doped (100) ZnTe, we have demonstrated high (60%) selectivity for CO 2 reduction to CO in the absence of cocatalysts. Overall, we showed the correlation between the CO 2 R selectivity and ZnTe orientation and this work can be leveraged for developing catalyst-free tandem ZnTe-based photocathodes for carbon dioxide reduction.

In this study, Cleaner Production (CP) strategy and Carbon Emission Pinch Analysis (CEPA) were used to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission generated in printing industry. CP audit was conducted in a printing premise to quantify the consumption of materials and energy, waste generated and other aspect such as safety and productivity. The amount of CO2 emission generated from the operations and activities in the premise was estimated to identify key issues. Subsequently, CP options were identified to overcome the issues. Feasibility studies were conducted for each option identified to evaluate the reduction of CO2 emission and monetary returns. The study revealed that a total of 0.8 kg CO2 emission was generated per kg of paper processed, where electricity consumption was the main contributor. A total of eight CP options were identified and evaluated to reduce CO2 emission generated from the electricity consumption and solid waste generation. Implementations of the suggested CP options are expected to potentially reduce the CO2 emission to 0.7 tons CO2/kg of processed paper, which is a reduction of 78%. The CEPA study also demonstrated that a saving of 211,194 kWh/month of electricity and a reduction of CO2 emission of 141.5 tons/month (68%) from the total emission of 209 tons/month could be achieved. There are four CP options can be implemented without any cost incurred, with expected CO2 emission reduction of 96.5 tons/month. Hence, the case study proves that it is possible to reduce CO2 emission in printing premise by implementing CP and CEPA.

CO 2 reduction is an important step in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The utilization of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) realizes high current density CO 2 reduction. However, most of the developed CO 2 reduction catalysts suffer from low Faradaic efficiency when using a proton exchange membrane MEA, due to low local pH surrounding catalysts. Alternatively, with an anion exchange membrane MEA, CO 2 reduction suffers from low conversion efficiency due to carbonate-bicarbonate crossover through the membrane to the anode. For continuously-running CO 2 electrolyzers, the crossover of acids and cations results in low reduction efficiency and flooding of the GDE. We have designed and characterized an asymmetric membrane that prohibits carbonate-bicarbonate crossover, yet can maintain a high local pH surrounding the catalyst. The resulting MEA can achieve high Faradaic efficiency toward CO 2 reduction using developed catalysts with near-zero CO 2 crossover. When using oxygen evolution in the anode, we further developed an ion-blockage strategy to diminish the crossover of acids or cations during long-term operation, maintaining a relatively stable and suitable environment for CO 2 reduction on GDE. The crossover management of carbonate, bicarbonate, protons and cations can lead to a long lifetime high-efficiency CO 2 electrolyzer.

As the global economy transitions towards carbon neutrality, innovative secondary energy sources are becoming increasingly pivotal. Hydrogen derived from zero-carbon power and synthetic fuels produced by bonding carbon dioxide (CO2) with hydrogen—hereafter referred to as Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) fuels in this article—are expected to complement electricity as critical components in this transition. However, to incentivise the use of these alternatives, mechanisms must be in place to ensure that their adoption effectively translates into reductions in CO2 emissions for users. With this in mind, this paper reviews the current issues related to the ‘attribution’ of GHG emissions or emission reductions for CCU fuels, reviews the current status and developments of the various relevant schemes, and identifies their challenges. It then categorises and proposes solutions: CCU fuel characteristics and challenges arising from its counting methods: CCU fuels are attracting attention for their potential as a new energy source that does not require changes to existing fossil fuel infrastructure and utilisation equipment. Although CCU fuels emit CO2 during combustion, their CO2 is recovered from what would otherwise be in the atmosphere, so long as the carbon content (C) of the fuel is focused on, fuel use does not increase global CO2 emissions. However, as long as the conventional counting rule—emissions are attributed to the physical emitting point—is applied, the fuel users are not incentivised to choose CCU fuels since they are identical to the fossil fuels under the rule. In order to design a system that promotes the use of CCU fuels, it is necessary to consider how to count the CO2 emissions associated with the production and use of CCU fuels, not bound by conventional approaches. In particular, clear international rules need to be set on which countries get the value of the emission reductions when they are traded crossing national borders. Approaches to international rule-making: Currently, the IPCC, ISO, EU, Japan and others are working on guidelines and rules directly or indirectly related to the handling of CCU fuels. Based on theoretical considerations and taking into account the content of these developments, this paper proposes the following approach: • Basically, CCU fuels are counted by the user as fuels with zero emission factor during combustion. At the same time, at the origin of the CCU fuel, the counting method is adopted: ‘CO2 captured and used for CCU fuel synthesis is considered as not captured for convenience’; • At the national level, possible approaches include (1) rule setting on the National GHG Inventory (IPCC Guidelines and relevant CMA decisions), which is used for accounting for the achievement of NDC targets; (2) adoption of national rules; and (3) transfer of ITMOs through bilateral agreements; • It is best to set national rules for companies in each country that are also consistent with them; and • Technically, the key point is how to guarantee “being CCU fuel” in the rules, such as certification of origin, and its emittability of captured CO2 in the baseline. The potential of CCU fuels can be maximised if the rules are set up in a way that is as easy to understand, common and workable as possible. To this end, instead of simply waiting for the completion of the IPCC methodology report and the subsequent discussions in the CMA of the Paris Agreement, it is desirable to continue to provide opportunities for all stakeholders, including governments and industry, to engage in dialogue and harmonise the rules, and to support discussions in the IPCC and UNFCCC.

In this chapter, photocatalytic systems for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using metal complexes are discussed. To construct efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems, two functions, i.e., redox photosensitizer and catalyst, are required. Metal complexes displaying visible-light absorption and long lifetimes in the excited states might be suitable for redox photosensitizers and redox-active metal complexes having a labile ligand forming a vacant site to activate CO2 can possibly be used as catalysts. Simple mixed systems of them photocatalyze the reduction of CO2. In addition, supramolecular photocatalysts in which they are linked via covalent bonds are also introduced.

The direct CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) from simulated flue gas of various CO2 concentrations could minimize extra energy for pre‐concentration processes to highly concentrated CO2 as a feed­stock. We investigate the challenges for CO2RR caused by low CO2 concentrations and provide strategies concerning the impact of the chosen electrocatalyst material and the selection of the electrolyte to attain high CO selectivity. We continuously feed CO2 mixed with N2 (the typical dilutant in flue gas) in various ratios to gas diffusion electrodes in a model flow‐through electrolyzer. Operating the CO2RR at lower CO2 concentrations results in an overpotential shift to more cathodic values. We show that higher active catalysts can maintain high CO selectivity down to 5% CO2 by using Ag‐ and NiCu‐based catalysts. NiCu reached its limit when the CO2 concentration was lowered to 2%, due to low CO2 availability and competition of carbonate formation. Employing near‐neutral electrolytes with buffering capacity, we maintained high Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials and higher CO2 utilization at low CO2 concentration.

The proceeding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires the formation of active hydrogen species for CO2 protonation, while traditional catalysts fail to balance the rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. Herein, we propose a “hydrogen on demand” mechanism, in which the polarity of the adsorbed CO2 is enhanced to allow the capture of hydrogen from water without forming free hydrogen species, realizing the matching rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. As a proof of concept, we construct Zn–N sites modified by Se atoms, allowing the proceeding of CO2RR under the “hydrogen on demand” mechanism with superior efficiency. The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of −539.7 mA cm−2, faradaic efficiencies of CO > 90% over a broad window from −0.5 to −1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6 × 104 h−1 in flow cell. In‐situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO2− with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.

Since the Industrial Revolution, massive amounts of generated from human industrial activities have been causing ongoing climate change and environmental impacts on Earth. Hence, there is a substantial body of research aimed at mitigating CO 2 emissions to address climate change. Research on CO 2 reduction has been actively conducted, focusing on electrochemical-based CO 2 conversion capable of operating under high current and long-term conditions. Under high current and prolonged operation, catalyst are influenced by the concentration of CO 2 within the catalytic layer. To investigate the impact of CO 2 concentration, we fabricated reaction zones of flow plates used in zero-gap MEA electrolyzers in both flat and sunken shapes. The two flow plates feature an inlet with a channel to guide the incoming gas to the reaction zone and a channel within the reaction zone to distribute the gas effectively. Both the flat and sunken type feature. Both the flat and sunken shapes contain a reaction zone channel where the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is positioned at the top. However, In the sunken flow plate, gas introduced from the inlet can penetrate towards the GDL side, facilitating enhanced delivery of CO 2 to the catalytic layer compared to flat flow plates. This leads to increased CO 2 activity within the catalytic layer and, simultaneously, offers the advantage of easier water management, a major cause of equipment performance degradation. In this study, we confirm through simulation that the sunken shape in flow plates with serpentine channels in the reaction zone offers advantages in CO 2 activity. Experimentally, we obtained partial current densities of 861 mA/cm 2 and 1 A/cm 2 for silver catalyst and NiNC catalyst, respectively, in the sunken serpentine structure. To analyze the reasons for the increase in these values, which are 34.5% and 18.3% higher respectively compared to the flat serpentine structure, we conducted device water discharge experiments and real-time CT imaging. Through this, we confirmed that water management is more efficient in the sunken serpentine structure. The insights and methods presented in this research are crucial for developing design principles suitable for large-scale industrial electrochemical CO 2 electrolysis. Figure 1

With the extensive use of fossil fuels and CO2 emission, the development of effective electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into high‐value‐added chemical products has become an important issue in academia community. Single‐atom alloys (SAA) integrate the advantages of single‐atoms catalysts and alloys, which can improve the activity and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) by adjusting the electronic and geometric structure of the host and guest metals simultaneously. This article provides a comprehensive review on the research advances of SAA catalysts used for CO2RR, including the synthesis and characterizations, computational design, experimental performances, and electronic structure effects of different SAA. Specifically, the correlations between experimental results and theoretical studies have been highlighted and discussed clearly in this review, which provide unique fundamental insights on the CO2RR performances of SAA catalysts. Based on these understanding, we finally propose a workflow combining both computational and experimental methods to rationally design the SAA, which can help the further development of CO2RR catalysts in the future.

Operando analysis is crucial for understanding the selectivity and stability of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Existing operando techniques normally adapt single-compartment cells operating at low currents. However, high current densities on the order of 100 mA cm-2 are required for practical applications, and under these conditions, selectivity and reaction pathways can differ. Here, we developed an inline operando NMR method compatible with high-current reaction conditions. Demonstrating on a copper-catalyzed eCO2RR at a current of 100 mA cm-2, our NMR study revealed a fast decrease of Faradaic efficiency for formate and ethanol within the first few hours of reaction, accompanied by a pH decrease from 14 to 8 within the first hour and a continuous concentration increase of bicarbonate. At 200 mA cm-2, the bicarbonate concentration reached the saturation point of 3.34 M within five hours. Water crossover was simultaneously observed and quantified via a deuteration technique and showed a strong current dependency. Our NMR observations revealed a highly dynamic environment of copper-catalyzed eCO2RR at high currents and will further aid the design and optimization of this reaction. Using on a common flow cell and a benchtop NMR system, the new operando approach is accessible by non-NMR experts and readily applicable to a wide range of catalysts, electrolyte compositions and reactor designs for eCO2RR.

The catalytic efficiency of M‐H2tpda pincer complexes (M = Mn(I), Fe(II), Co(III)) in CO2 hydrogenation, emphasizing the role of transition metal center variability have been discussed. The DFT analysis demonstrates that complexes with low αR values form weaker M—H bonds, enhancing catalyst reactivity with the elongation of M—H bond. The analysis further displays excellent catalytic performance for Mn‐H2tpda (ΔE = 20.3 kcal/mol), Fe‐H2tpda (ΔE = 21.0 kcal/mol) and Co‐H2tpda (ΔE = 23.6 kcal/mol) for CO2 to formic acid formation. The Co‐H2tpda (ΔE = 16.7 kcal/mol) is comparatively better than Mn‐H2tpda (ΔE = 20.7 kcal/mol) and Fe‐H2tpda (ΔE = 19.6 kcal/mol) in formaldehyde formation. All three catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the conversion of formaldehyde to methanol. The condensed Fukui function calculations of these catalyst complexes establish direct relationship between the ΔE for the rate limiting catalytic cycle and the electrophilicity of the metal centers. The TOF calculations further helped to understand the catalytic performance of the catalysts at various temperatures.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect, and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by about 50% since the Industrial Revolution. The signs of global warming are everywhere, and solving this problem requires analyzing the trend of CO2 concentration and its impact on global temperature. This report will establish mathematical models to verify the accuracy of CO2 concentration and analyze the feasibility of new models. At the same time, two models will be constructed to explore the relationship between global temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration and predict future trends. The results showed that the trend of carbon dioxide concentration is constantly increasing, whereas the trend of land-ocean temperature appears to be periodic. Pearson correlation analysis found that carbon dioxide was linearly correlated with temperature height, and linear regression further visualized this relationship. The forecast data show that carbon reduction needs to be taken seriously, or the consequences are serious, and both individuals and governments should take measures.

Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential across all sectors, including the maritime transport industry. Speed reduction is a key short-term operational measure for lowering GHG emissions from ships, and its implementation has already begun. While speed reduction offers significant benefits, particularly in terms of GHG emissions reduction potential, there are concerns about its application, including increased voyage times, an increase in the number of ships required, and the fact that ships may operate in conditions quite different from those for which they were designed and optimized. This study investigates the impact of speed reduction on ship performance in calm water, using a post-Panamax container ship as an example. Numerical simulations of resistance, open-water, and self-propulsion tests were conducted for a full-scale ship and propeller, and the results were validated against extrapolated towing tank data. Hydrodynamic characteristics, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions at various speeds were then estimated. The results indicated that when constant transport work was maintained, yearly CO2 emissions decreased by −16.89% with a 10% speed reduction, −21.97% with a 20% speed reduction, and −25.74% with a 30% speed reduction. This study demonstrates that the classical cubic law for fuel oil consumption and speed dependence is not valid, as the speed exponent is lower than 3. The potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing slow steaming are discussed. Finally, this research contributes to the existing literature by evaluating the CO2 emissions reduction potential of slow steaming.

Commencing nearly a decade ago, the scientific literature has shown that changes in the concentration of water vapor, a greenhouse gas with a heating power 400 times greater than carbon dioxide, CO2, closely match changes in the average global temperature. The foregoing notwithstanding, while there is no correlation between changes in the average global temperature and changes in the concentration of CO2; still a large community of interests including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), academia, agencies of government, various research institutions and enterprises, tens of thousands of scientists, public officials and policy makers which have worked for over three decades without proof, continue to assert that it is the increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2 that drives global warming. Thus, the myopic focus of this de-carbon community remains reducing carbon emissions. This is a major problem, because, while the data and the physics have clearly shown that when the global concentration of water vapor is reduced, the result is global cooling and reductions in catastrophic weather. and these relationships have not been discussed in the preeminent scientific literature. As a direct consequence, no steps to drive increased precipitation to reduce the concentration of water vapor have been undertaken. As each year passes, the size of the reduction sufficient to reverse global warming grows, thus, increasing the time necessary to effect this, whichmay take decades as annual devastation from catastrophic weather increases at a rate of $45 bn US every decade. To fight climate change, the policy must change to focus on encouraging the development of effective, efficient and sufficient means of increasing precipitation.

Human activities have caused a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, leading to greater absorption of CO2 by oceans and causing ocean acidification. This phenomenon, marked by a reduction in pH, represents substantial risks to marine ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. Seagrasses are vital elements of coastal ecosystems, performing important functions in carbon storage, stabilizing shorelines, and preserving biodiversity; however, reactions to ocean acidification are not well understood, especially in terms of molecular.This research study examined alterations in gene expression within seagrass meadows, namely the species Cymodocea nodosa, in reaction to simulated ocean acidification conditions. Climate chamber system to adjust CO2 levels to simulate future projections of ocean acidification, specifically following the RCP 8.5 scenario. Gene expression dynamics were assessed by collecting samples at different time intervals across a 36-hour period.Research has demonstrated that genes related to photosynthesis are suppressed quickly after being exposed to increased amounts of CO2. Gene expression levels were found to change often over time, which is crucial for adaptation and acclimatization. However, antioxidant genes have varied responses to ocean acidification, with CAT and SOD being downregulated in distinct ways.Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of seagrass responses to ocean acidification. It highlights the significance of examining short-term responses when evaluating the susceptibility of coastal ecosystems to climate change.

The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) using renewable energies is widely recognized as a promising approach to establishing a sustainable closed carbon cycle economy. To date, the focus of this field has primarily been on the electrolysis of ambient pressure CO 2 , where the critical factors include the limited solubility of CO 2 in many electrolytes and its hindered mass transport to the electrodes. However, industrial CO 2 is typically pressurized during capture, transport, and storage, often existing in dissolved form. Herein, we shift our focus to the potential applications of supercritical CO 2 (SCO 2 ) obtained from industrial storage. By using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations integrated with the slow-growth sampling (SG-AIMD) method, we conducted a systematic investigation into the supercritical CO 2 reduction reaction (SCO 2 RR) on various Cu surfaces. Our findings reveal that Cu(111) favors CO* generation, while Cu(100) promotes formic acid production under the reaction conditions of SCO 2 R. In the meantime, we present a comprehensive free energy diagram incorporating both kinetics and thermodynamics of SCO 2 and Cu atom migration, which illustrates the critical role of Cu sites with high coordination numbers induced by intermediate adsorption in the overall performance of CO 2 electroreduction into formic acid. This study would lay the foundation for potential applications of supercritical CO2 and the designing of effective catalysts in the future.

Global warming is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). A metric used to quantify the change in CO2 emissions is the marginal emission factor, defined as the marginal change in CO2 emissions resulting from a marginal change in electricity demand over a specified period. This paper aims to present two methodologies to estimate the marginal emission factor in a decarbonized electricity system with high temporal resolution. First, we present an energy systems model that incrementally calculates the marginal emission factors. Second, we examine a Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model, a statistical model designed to estimate marginal emission factors faster and use an incremental marginal emission factor as a benchmark to assess its precision. For the German electricity market, we estimate the marginal emissions factor time series historically (2019, 2020) using Agora Energiewende and for the future (2025, 2030, and 2040) using estimated energy system data. The results indicate that the Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model is more accurate in estimating marginal emission factors than the Dynamic Linear Regression models, which are frequently used in the literature. Hence, the Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model is a simpler alternative to the computationally intensive incremental marginal emissions factor, especially when short-term marginal emissions factor estimation is needed. The results of the marginal emission factor estimation are applied to an exemplary low-emission vehicle charging scenario to estimate CO2 savings by shifting the charge hours to those corresponding to the lower marginal emissions factor. By implementing this emission-minimized charging approach, an average reduction of 31% in the marginal emission factor was achieved over the 5 years.

Malaysia generates substantial agricultural residues annually, endowing the country with significant biomass energy potential. Palm oil biomass stands out as a promising feedstock. However, its high humidity, bulkiness, low energy density, and dispersed resource locations (mills) pose challenges. A network that consisting collection facilities incorporating pretreatment operations as intermediaries between mills and biorefineries is a plausible solution. Nevertheless, the facility locations directly impact travel distance, overall expenses, and the nearby population. Moreover, vehicle routing during biomass collection influences transportation costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Consequently, this research designs a model to address the location-routing intricacies within a two-echelon biomass supply chain. The model operates as a multi-objective optimization framework, encompassing three-dimensional sustainability assessment, quantified respectively as total cost minimization, CO2 emissions reduction, and minimization of the population affected. The research initially optimizes each objective function individually and subsequently advances to multi-objective optimization employing the weighted sum approach. While single-objective optimization yields optimal outcomes for each dimension, enhancements in one aspect may hinder performance in others. Nonetheless, the multi-objective optimization provides insight into the trade-offs among the sustainability objectives. The computational findings demonstrate the model could adapt the network configuration in alignment with distinct sustainability aspirations.

Structural transformations in OECD countries significantly influence carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, affecting economic and social dimensions. These transformations encompass changes in industrial composition, technological progress, energy consumption patterns, and policy frameworks. This research investigates the impact of such structural shifts on CO2 emissions across a panel of 38 OECD countries between 2000 and 2021, using panel cointegration techniques to ensure robust analysis. The study confirms the presence of cross-sectional dependence among countries and establishes long-run cointegration relationships. Results from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) models indicate that renewable energy, advancements in information and communication technology, and structural changes significantly reduce CO2 emissions. In contrast, economic growth, reliance on non-renewable energy, and institutional quality are linked to higher emissions. However, estimates derived from Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) and Mean Group Panel (MGP) methods differ from those of FMOLS and DOLS, underscoring potential methodological variances in evaluating these relationships. This study highlights the pivotal role of structural changes in emission reduction strategies, while also emphasizing the importance of methodological choices in policy analysis. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align economic growth with environmental sustainability within OECD countries. Moreover, the research stresses the necessity of incorporating structural changes into long-term climate strategies to ensure their effectiveness. Future studies could expand the analysis by integrating more recent data and exploring non-linear relationships to refine policy recommendations further.

Carbon dioxide is emitted in several industrial processes and contributes to global warming. One of the industries that is considered a significant emitter is metallurgy. Therefore, it is necessary to search for and implement methods to reduce its emissions from metallurgical processes. An alternative option to the use of conventional coke, which is produced solely from fossil coal, is the utilization of bio-coke. The production of bio-coke involves the use of coking coal and the incorporation of biomass-derived substances such as biochar (charcoal). The article presents the results of the research on the influence of the biochar addition on the structural, textural, and technological properties of produced bio-coke. Research on the production and analysis of the properties of the obtained bio-coke aimed at assessing the potential possibilities of applying it in the process of a carbothermal reduction of manganese ore in order to smelt ferroalloys. Studies have shown that biochar addition to the coking blend in an amount of up to 20% allows a bio-coke characterized by properties enabling the mentioned use to be obtained. Bio-coke was characterized by higher CO2 reactivity index (CRI), lower post-reaction strength (CSR), and higher reactivity to synthetic manganese ore than regular metallurgical coke. In the context of industrial applications of bio-coke, it is necessary to verify its production and use on a pilot and industrial scale.

A reduction in emissions in transportation is paramount to achieve full compliance with the European Union’s 2050 targets. In this framework, a great boost to the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of internal combustion engines fueled by petroleum-derived fuels can be obtained through the adoption of biomass-derived fuels that can be employed in conventional series production engine vehicles. This paper presents the results of an experimental activity on a two-cylinder turbocharged common rail diesel engine, whose main application is for urban mobility, fueled with renewable fuels: Neste MY Renewable Diesel and Eni HVOlution. Aimed at analyzing the potential employment of renewable fuels as drop-in alternative fuels, the engine performance and emissions were investigated under fixed settings of the injection parameters, in the complete range of the engine speed, at the full pedal position. The comparison with the data from tests in which the engine was fueled with fossil diesel highlighted minimal differences in the performance outcomes, while significant differences were observed in the emissions results. In more detail, there were reduced carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (HVO produced using Ecofining™ technology retained better behavior in relation to HVO produced using the NEXBTL™ technology), advantages in hydrocarbon (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (HVO from NESTE Oil performed better than HVO from ENI), a decrease in the particle mass and number emissions (HVO from Ecofining™ technology was characterized by a lower particle number and court mean diameter in relation to HVO from the NEXBTL™ technology). The results highlight that an optimization of the engine settings based on the specific properties of each fuel could allow us to take full advantage of these fuels in reducing the environmental impact of cars.

Between 2013 and 2018, commercial aviation saw a 70% increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, significantly outpacing United Nations projections. This alarming trend is anticipated to continue, with emissions potentially tripling by 2050, driven by economic expansion and an increasing dependence on fossil fuels. In 2022, the aviation industry’s energy consumption reached 12.1 MJ/RTK, with projections forecasting a 2.8 to 3.9-fold increase by 2040. Without a strategic shift towards sustainable alternatives, aviation emissions are expected to reach 2,000 megatons by mid-century, posing a severe threat to global climate stability. This study emphasizes the urgent need for the aviation sector to adopt high-energy, reliable alternative fuels that can mitigate its environmental impact. A comprehensive evaluation and comparison of potential alternative fuels are presented, focusing on their energy densities, production processes, and environmental footprints. The research highlights the potential of these alternatives to meet the industry’s energy demands while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Technological advancements in fuel production and aircraft propulsion are also explored, underscoring their role in achieving meaningful emissions reductions. The study argues that integrating sustainable practices and fostering innovation within the aviation sector are critical for ensuring its long-term sustainability and resilience. By transitioning to alternative fuels and embracing new technologies, the aviation industry can not only address its environmental challenges but also lead the way in global efforts to combat climate change and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.    

    

## Improving the Stability of Gas Diffusion Electrodes for CO2 Electroreduction to Formate with Sn and In-Based Catalysts at 500 mA cm–2: Effect of Electrode Design and Operation Mode

The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) using renewable electricity sources could provide a sustainable solution for generating valuable chemicals, such as formate salt or formic acid. However, an efficient, stable, and scalable electrode generating formate at industrially viable current densities (>100 mA cm–2) is yet to be developed. Sn or In-based catalysts in gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) can efficiently produce formate. However, their long-term durability is limited owing to catalyst deactivation, carbonate deposition, and electrode flooding. Herein, a systematic study of 20 cm2 GDEs with SnO2 and In2O3 catalyst layers is presented in conjunction with various electrode operation strategies (i.e., flow-by vs flow through, dry vs humidified CO2, continuous vs reverse polarity pulse electrolysis). It is demonstrated that the incorporation of CeO2 nanoparticles as a promoter in either SnO2 or In2O3 catalyst layers coupled with intermittent reverse polarity pulse operation dramatically improves the GDE stability during 12 h of tests at 500 mA cm–2 with over 90% formate Faradaic efficiency. Due to its strong oxidizing capacity, CeO2 helps Sn and In regain their valence state of + IV and + III, respectively, which are in situ reduced during CO2RR, as shown by the surface characterization of the electrodes. The effect of the initial particle size of SnO2 and reverse polarity pulse on the catalytic activity, durability, and carbonate salt precipitation in the GDE have also been addressed. Regarding two-phase flow dynamics, the quasi-convective gas flow through the GDE was more beneficial than the gas flow-by mode for enabling stable operation at high current densities (up to 500 mA cm–2). The synergistic approach of catalyst layer engineering coupled with diverse GDE operation modes explored here is promising for the scale-up of efficient and durable reactors for the CO2RR to formate and CO2 redox flow batteries.

Combining spectroscopy with electrochemistry enables the monitoring of changes in bonding, molecular orientation, and chemical composition during electrochemical processes at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) allows a direct in situ monitoring of electrochemical processes occurring at the electrode interface due plasmonic enhancement by surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). 1 Electrochemical ATR-SEIRAS has been used extensively for investigating electrocatalysis 2,3 , characterizing adsorbed species 4 , and detecting reaction intermediates 5 . However, SEIRAS literature has focused on plasmonic metals while the small number of SEIRAS studies reported on graphene surfaces are incompatible with electrochemical experimentation or not considered. Nonetheless, carbon electrodes are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis, sensing, and energy storage 6 , thus probing their surface chemistries are of particular interest. Thus, there is still a need for a convenient substrate for probing graphitic interfaces using electrochemical SEIRAS. In our first study 1 , we expanded the scope of SEIRAS by introducing a robust hybrid graphene on gold (graphene-gold) substrate where we monitored electrografting processes occurring on the graphene/electrolyte interface. The graphene-gold substrate successfully monitored the electrografting of 2,2,6,6-tetremethyl-1-pipperridine N-oxyl (4-amino-TEMPO) and 4-nitrobenzene diazonium (4-NBD) in real-time using SEIRAS and cyclic voltammetry. The graphene-gold substrate is proficient at resolving the spectral responses of the electrografting and redox transformations of the grafted moieties occurring at the graphene interface spectroscopically and electrochemically. We clearly demonstrate highly sensitive SEIRAS in real-time at a graphene interface. This substrate opens a plethora of possibilities for real-time electrochemical ATR-SEIRAS investigations on graphitic interfaces such as catalysis, battery research, and CO 2 capture and conversion, the latter of which our laboratory is exploring using modified electrodes. Electrochemical carbon capture and concentration (eCCC) methods have emerged as a prosing alternative to the current state-of-the-art temperature-pressure swing systems. 7 Redox-active organic (RAO) molecules such as quinones have been reported to reversibly capture and release CO 2. 7 However, they suffer from low solubility in solution. New approaches have explored immobilizing these molecules on electrode interfaces for increased CO 2 adsorption capacities. 11 Our graphene-gold allows a unique opportunity for an in situ mechanistic investigation of the immobilization and carbonization of RAOs. Our current work investigating immobilized aminoanthraquinone and a riboflavin derivative will be presented.

Our research interests aim at establishing structure/property relations leading to rational designs of functionalized materials for efficient electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy conversion and storage. There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To optimize the hydrogenation-type electrocatalytic approach, we have proposed to utilize nanostructured metallic centers (e.g. Pd, Pt or Ru) in a form of highly dispersed and reactive nanoparticles generated within supramolecular network of distinct nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen-coordination complexes. Among important issues are the mutual completion between hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction and specific interactions between coordinating centers and metallic sites. We have also explored the ability of biofilms to form hydro-gel-type aggregates of microorganisms attached to various surfaces including those of carbon electrode materials. Upon incorporation of various noble metal nanostructures and/or conducting polymer ultra-thin films, highly reactive and selective systems toward CO 2 -reduction have been obtained. Another possibility to enhance electroreduction of carbon dioxide is to explore direct transformation of solar energy to chemical energy using transition metal oxide semiconductor materials. We show here that, by intentional and controlled combination of metal oxide semiconductors (titanium (IV) oxide and copper (I) oxide), we have been able to drive effectively photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide mostly to methanol. Application of metal oxides as active matrices in electrocatalysis is particular importance. The hydrous behavior, which favors proton mobility and affects overall reactivity, reflects not only the oxide’s chemical properties but its texture and morphology as well. For example, the mixed WO 3 /ZrO 2 systems are characterized by fast charge (electron, proton) propagation during the system’s redox transitions. By dispersing metallic Cu electrocatalytic nanoparticles over such active WO 3 /ZrO 2 supports, the electrocatalytic activities of the respective systems toward the reduction of carbon dioxide have been enhanced even at decreased loadings in acid media. The fact that WO 3 /ZrO 2 nanostructures are in immediate contact with the metallic catalytic sites leads to the specific interactions (via the surface hydroxyl groups) with the reaction intermediates (e.g. CO adsorbates). Formation of ammonia is one of the most important chemical synthetic processes. Under industrial conditions, ammonia is primarily been synthesized from nitrogen and hydrogen via the Haber-Bosch process which requires pressurizing and heating, despite utilization of catalysts. Consequently, development of low-temperature synthetic methodology is tempting both from the practical and fundamental reasons. An ultimate goal for electrochemistry is to generate NH 3 from N 2 at temperatures lower than 100ºC, atmospheric pressure, and with use of new generation of catalysts. Currently, most of electrochemical approaches to drive N 2 -fixation suffer from slow kinetics due to the difficulty of achieving the appropriate adsorption and activation of dinitrogen molecule leading to cleavage of the strong triple N≡N bond. Our recent studies, clearly demonstrate that coordinatively stabilized iron catalytic sites, e.g. iron-centered heme-type porphyrins or iron phosphide, FeP and Fe 2 P phases, have been found to act as efficient catalysts for the formation of NH 3 in alkaline and semi-neutral media.

In order to close the carbon cycle, the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reaction (CO2RR) using copper as a electrochemical catalyst is gaining much more attention. When considering the social implementation of the technology, the gaseous CO 2 used for the CO2RR should be collected from the atmosphere. However, the gas inevitably contains a number of impurities such as oxygen, NO x and SO x . Among them, the possibility of oxygen contamination is high, and the reactivity of oxygen is higher than that of CO 2 . Therefore, the oxygen would affect the reaction selectivity of CO2RR. To demonstrate the effect of oxygen on the CO2RR, oxygen-contaminated CO 2 gas was used as the feed gas for the system in previous reports. 1,2 For the positive effect of oxygen, the twenty percent of oxygen in the CO 2 gas decreased the overpotential for the CO2RR, thus increasing the reactivity of the reaction. On the other hand, for the negative effect of oxygen, the selectivity for CO2RR was largely decreased with only four percent of oxygen in the gas under high pressure conditions. The discrepancies in the reported results are due to various factors at different scales, such as current density, type of electrode, concentrations of reactants, surface pH, surface orientation of the catalyst, and oxidation number of the surface metal atoms. Among these factors, those related to the surface reactivity of the catalyst have the greatest effect on the reactivity and selectivity for CO2RR. The presence of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, such as O* and OH*, has been demonstrated during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) using Raman spectroscopy. 1 In the present work, 3 we perform first-principles calculations for the CO2RR in the presence of oxygen species (O* or OH*) on the Cu(100) surface to focus on the effect of the adsorption of ORR intermediates (Figure 1a) while excluding macroscale differences, such as surface pH, local concentration of reactants, and other factors. In the results of the calculation, we identified the most stable structure of the Cu(100) surface on which zero to five of one kind of oxygen reduction intermediates were adsorbed. Using the obtained surface, the activation energy for CHO* formation by CO hydrogenation was calculated. In the results, the activation energy was 0.74 eV on the clean Cu(100) surface, increased on the OH*/Cu(100) surface (Figure 1b), and decreased to a maximum of 0.15 eV on the O*/Cu(100) surface (Figure 1c). This is because the initial state of CO hydrogenation was activated by the oxygen atoms adsorbed onto the Cu(100) surface. References (1) He, M.; Li, C.; Zhang, H.; Chang, X.; Chen, J.

There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change, and its conversion into useful carbon-based fuels or chemicals. Numerous homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been proposed to induce the CO 2 reduction and, depending on the reaction conditions various products that include carbon monoxide, oxalate, formate, carboxylic acids, formaldehyde, acetone or methanol, in addition to various hydrocarbons at different ratios. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To produce highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts, the transition-metal-based molecular materials are often considered. It is believed that, during electroreduction, the rate limiting step is the protonation of the adsorbed CO product to form the CHO adsorbate. Because reduction of CO 2 can effectively occur by hydrogenation, to optimize the conventional copper-based electrocatalytic approach, we explore such a model catalytic matrix as nanostructured tungsten oxide nanowires which are capable to undergo partial reduction to hydrogen-rich nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide bronzes. We demonstrate here that following the ntercalation of copper into tungsten(VI)-oxide-nanowires, the resulting electrocatalytic systems exhibits synergistic properties toward electroreduction of carbon dioxide, in addition to other inert inorganic reactants, such as oxygen, nitrates(V), nitrates(III) or bromates(V). In particular, evidence has been provided that hierarchically deposited films (on glassy carbon) of copper(I) oxide decorated with tungsten(VI) oxide nanowires and, subsequently, subjected to electroreduction and voltammetric conditioning to generate hybrid Cu/WO 3 catalyst can be successfully utilized to drive reduction of carbon dioxide (saturated solution, concentration, ca. 0.033 mol dm -3 )in a fairly strong acid medium of 0.5 mol dm -3 H 2 SO 4 . Here formation of the partially reduced tungsten oxides (H x WO 3 and WO 3-y ) is accompanied by consumption of protons and sorption of hydrogen, and it tends to inhibit hydrogen evolution by shifting the proton discharge toward more negative potentials. Our observations are consistent with the view that copper is irreversibly trapped (i.e., it cannot be reoxidized) within the network of WO 3 nanowires. The dispersed metallic copper sites seem to facilitate electron transfers and charge distribution in the catalytic layers. Among important issues are the capacity of copper-containing partially reduced tungsten oxides to induce reductions of nitrates, bromates and oxygen in acid medium. On mechanistic grounds, the existence of hydrogen-rich partially-reduced tungsten oxides, H x WO 3 , which contain large population of delocalized electrons and monoatomic H, or coexisting protons and electrons, H + + e - , is likely to induce hydrogenation of carbon oxo species, followed by protonation, in the vicinity of Cu to form oxo-hydrocarbon-type products. The hybrid Cu/WO 3 system, is also characterized by improved durability, relative to pristine Cu 2 O-dervied copper, as evident from electroreductions under chronoamperometric conditions. Our research aiming at optimization the material’s activity and selectivity have also concentrated on application of mixed oxides, e.g. WO 3 -ZrO 2 . Finally, the present study demonstrates the usefulness of certain diagnostic electroanalytical approaches, such as ultramicroelectrode-based sensing,chronocoulometric probing of the diffusional-type charge propagation dynamics , or voltammetric stripping and monitoring of small organic or inorganic molecules as electroreduction products.

The county-to-district reform, as an important measure to break down administrative barriers between cities and counties and promote market integration, raises the question of whether it influences enterprise carbon emissions behaviour. By utilising data from 1992 to 2019 and matching it with patent data for Chinese listed companies, this paper examines the impact of the county-to-district reform on enterprise carbon emissions. The findings show that the reform accelerates market integration, facilitates the free flow of production factors, thus expanding the scale of enterprise production and increasing total carbon dioxide emissions from enterprises. Meanwhile, this process alleviates financing constraints for enterprises and increases the proportion of research and development investment on one hand; on the other hand, the reform intensifies market competition, thereby improving enterprise productivity. Ultimately, this leads to a reduction in overall carbon emission intensity. This phenomenon is particularly evident in non-state-owned enterprises, non-carbon trading pilot regions, northern regions, and small and medium-sized enterprises. This paper explores the impact of changes in China's government power structure on enterprise carbon emissions behaviour, adding to the research on the role of micro-level enterprises in carbon reduction during the county-to-district reform process.

National carbon peak track and optimized provincial carbon allocations are crucial for mitigating regional inequality within the commercial building sector during China's transition to carbon neutrality. This study proposes a top-down model to evaluate carbon trajectories in operational commercial buildings up to 2060. Through Monte Carlo simulation, scenario analysis is conducted to assess carbon peak values and the corresponding peaking year, thereby optimizing carbon allocation schemes both nationwide and provincially. The results reveal that (1) the nationwide carbon peak for commercial building operations is projected to reach 890 (+- 50) megatons of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) by 2028 (+- 3.7 years) in the case of the business-as-usual scenario, with a 7.87% probability of achieving the carbon peak under the decarbonization scenario. (2) Significant disparities will exist among provinces, with Shandong's carbon peak projected at 69.6 (+- 4.0) MtCO2 by 2029, approximately 11 times higher than Ningxia's peak of 6.0 (+- 0.3) MtCO2 by 2027. (3) Guided by the principle of maximizing the emission reduction potential, the optimal provincial allocation scheme reveals the top three provinces requiring the most significant reductions in the commercial sector: Xinjiang (5.6 MtCO2), Shandong (4.8 MtCO2), and Henan (4.7 MtCO2). Overall, this study offers optimized provincial carbon allocation strategies within the commercial building sector in China via dynamic scenario simulations, with the goal of hitting the carbon peak target and progressing toward a low-carbon future for the building sector.

The objective of this study is to investigate the temporal variation of forest cover and carbon stock change within the Middle Awash River Basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the years 1995, 2010, and 2023. The study utilized multi-temporal Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine cloud API platform and employed the Random Forest Algorithm for LULC classification. The above-ground carbon stock in the present study was computed from total forest cover of the basin. The results indicate a significant decline in forest cover within the Basin, which decreased from 1,521.88 km&sup2; in 1995 to 1,174.10 km&sup2; in 2010 and further to 825.20 km&sup2; by 2023. Alongside this reduction, total wood volume and dry matter biomass also experienced declines, with wood volume falling from 876.28 m&sup3; to 676.03 m&sup3;, and then to 475.14 m&sup3;, while dry matter biomass decreased from 376.80 tons to 290.69 tons, and finally to 204.31 tons. These trends highlight a troubling reduction in carbon stock and an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Overall, the gradual decline in carbon stocks and the loss of forest cover within the basin highlight the urgent need to implement effective conservation strategies aimed at restoring and safeguarding the remaining forest ecosystems.

Abstract CO 2 -to-CO electrolyzer technology converts carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide using electrochemical methods, offering significant environmental and energy benefits by aiding in greenhouse gas mitigation and promoting a carbon circular economy. Recent study by Strasser et al. in Nature Chemical Engineering presents a high-performance CO 2 -to-CO electrolyzer utilizing a NiNC catalyst with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency, employing innovative diagnostic tools like the carbon crossover coefficient (CCC) to address transport-related failures and optimize overall efficiency. Strasser’s research demonstrates the potential of NiNC catalysts, particularly NiNC-IMI, for efficient CO production in CO 2 -to-CO electrolyzers, highlighting their high selectivity and performance. However, challenges such as localized CO 2 depletion and mass transport limitations underscore the need for further optimization and development of diagnostic tools like CCC. Strategies for optimizing catalyst structure and operational parameters offer avenues for enhancing the performance and reliability of electrochemical CO 2 reduction catalysts.

As the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly visible, carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) is gaining popularity to convert waste carbon dioxide to value-added products. As carbon monoxide (CO) is a key intermediate for valuable products such as methane and ethylene, CORR is studied to bypass CO 2 activation. Most of the work on CO2RR and CORR has focused on using water as a proton source as water’s hydrogen bonding supports key intermediates and acts as a proton source for hydrogenated products. Using nonaqueous solvents instead of water decreases the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water breakdown. Additionally mixed aqueous-nonaqueous systems allow for fundamental understanding of water’s role in electrochemical transformations when it is only available in limited quantities as a proton source. Here, we experimentally control water speciation and activity using aprotic solvent media during CORR. Remarkably, we show that aprotic solvents that support microheterogeneous water-water clusters leads to significant amounts of CORR products (methane and ethylene) with a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 22% in acetonitrile (χ H2O = 0.2); the first report of CORR to C2+ products using water in an aprotic solvent. In contrast, microhomogeneous systems – where water integrates into the solvents’ intermolecular binding network at all length scales and has lower water activity – primarily support undesired HER. Insights gained expand our understanding of water activity and nonaqueous electrolyte design for other important transformations reactions beyond CO reduction such as CO2RR and HER.

Abstract Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by skeletal muscle hypermetabolism following exposure to halogenated anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine. The sustained muscle contraction produces a depletion of adenosine triphosphate, dramatically increasing oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and heat. We present the rare case report of MH diagnosed intraoperatively posted for an open reduction and internal fixation surgery of the right mid-shaft of femur fracture. Unfortunately, the patient developed MH and succumbed. In every hospital set-up where MH-triggering anesthetics are administered, an adequate stock of dantrolene and other medications and rescue equipment must be available to treat the MH crisis.

CCUS (Carbon dioxide Capture, Utilization and Storage), is attracting attention as an effective method for reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions toward carbon neutrality by 2050. Currently, chemical absorption followed by thermal desorption using liquid amine is employed as the CO 2 capture and concentration technology. However, low energy efficiency and high cost of the thermal swing process remain to be addressed. CO 2 capture driven by renewable electricity represents a promising alternative approach to mitigate CO 2 emissions and address climate change. Electrochemically mediated carbon capture can be achieved by developing redox-active CO 2 adsorbents, such as quinones. In aprotic electrolytes, reduced quinone species can selectively uptake CO 2 from a dilute feed upon electro-reduction via a nucleophilic addition reaction and release a concentrated CO 2 upon electrochemical oxidation. However, the low solubility of quinones in nonaqueous solvents limits their total CO 2 carrying capacity in the system. We synthesized a salt of imidazolium modified anthraquinone with ionic liquid-like structure to address the solubility issue. The synthesized cationic quinone derivatives showed more than 100 times higher solubility and high ionic conductivity as well as electrochemically reversible CO 2 adsorption-desorption. In addition, we synthesized anionic quinone derivatives, anthraquinone with sulfonate (SO 3 − ) moiety, by one-step salt metathesis reaction, and confirmed that the negatively charged quinones is also applicable to the electrochemical CO 2 capture. We report the electrochemical CO 2 capture-release behaviors of the ionic quinones and its monitoring using in situ spectroscopic analysis with the aid of density functional theory calculations.

Because of the climate crisis caused by increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration, developing technologies for reducing them has become imperative. Among various tries, electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECRR) is one of the promising solutions for carbon dioxide recycling as it can be used for the production of more valuable industrial chemicals(e.g. syngas, CO, formic acid...) in a clean way. Ethylene, one of the products, has a high market price of 1.30 dollars/kg. It has various uses for polyethylene production and ethylbenzene synthesis. Ethanol is 1.00 dollars/kg and can be used as fuel. In addition, formic acid has a high value of 0.74 dollars/kg and is used in preservatives and anti-bacterial agents. Carbon monoxide can be easily converted into other hydrocarbon forms through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis For electrolysis, gas diffusion layer(GDL) based electrolyzers have been used. This is because carbon dioxide has a solubility limit of 33 mM, so humidified carbon dioxide in the form of a gas is used to overcome this up to 41 mM. The hybrid flow cell is an electrolytic bath in which a gas diffusion layer and a cathode liquid layer are separated from the anode by a polymer membrane. It is easy to collect liquid products generated from the cathode side, but it has resistance by the liquid layer. The MEA electrolyzer is an AEMWE-based electrolytic bath in which the cathode liquid layer has been removed. Since the electrode and the membrane are in direct contact and contain a small amount of liquid, a three-phase interface is formed, resulting in an electrolytic reaction. Focusing on the catalyst, Cu is the only mono-metal that shows decent selectivity for multi-carbon products(e.g. ethylene, ethanol, acetate, propanol...). For decades, various researches have been conducted on the development of Cu catalysts through bi-metal composition, oxidation state control and about grain boundaries, crystal facet, single-atom. However, it still has challenges about low partial current density and insufficient stability to commercialize. Herein, copper sulfide catalysts were fabricated on gas diffusible carbon paper with microporous layer(MPL/CP). First, Cu nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited on the MPL/CP. Subsequent immersing it into Na 2 S solution enables ionic exchange of surface oxygens with S ions. Because the copper sulfide state has low solubility product constant, so is thermodynamically more stable. As reported, sulfur can change the distance between metal molecules, their oxidation state and their morphologies. By adjusting the exchange condition, the catalyst morphology and surface composition can be easily controlled. The fabricated electrodes were employed as cathodes for CO 2 RR electrolyzer and its faradaic efficiency(FE) was computed. It was revealed that the CO 2 RR performance was highly affected by S coverage on Cu surface. At some point the existence of Sulfur changed selectivity by enhancing the FE of ethylene and oppressing FE of methane.

Climate change caused by global warming has led to disasters in many countries around the world. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for "taking specific measures against climate change." The time has come for humanity to think concretely about ways to suppress the increase in greenhouse gases, which ate thought to be the cause of global warming, and to actually implement them. Among the known greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) accounts for about 75% and is recognized as an important target. Various efforts have already been made to reduce CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, in order to reduce the amount of CO 2 emitted into the atmosphere, technologies for geological storage and conversion of CO 2 are indispensable. CO 2 becomes a resource if it can be converted into useful industrial resources such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, or hydrocarbons in processes that utilize surplus or renewable energy. Many electrochemical reduction techniques have been studied for CO 2 conversion, and Dr. Yoshio Hori has conducted a comprehensive study of electrochemical reduction of CO 2 using metal electrocatalysts1). It has been clarified that the products are different depending on the metal species, and studies are underway to change the surface morphology and crystal planes of metal electrodes and to combine multiple metals in metal electrocatalysts. These previous studies were to reveal that the adsorption strength of CO 2 and electrodes is based on the metal type of the electrode, and that changing the electrode metal changes the path, efficiency, and products of the electrochemical reduction reaction. The object of this research is to take a bird's-eye view of the characteristics of CO 2 electrochemical reduction using copper-based alloy plating electrodes, which we have been development. Among metal electrodes, copper, which can produce hydrocarbons, has been the most widely studied for CO 2 electrochemical reduction. When a copper-cobalt electrode is prepared by alloy plating, the ratio of the hydrocarbons, methane and ethylene, changes depending on the mixing ratio of cobalt. In this copper-cobalt electrode, cobalt exists as a substituted solid solution in the copper crystal structure, and it is considered that the generation efficiency of ethylene is reduced and that of methane is increased due to the inhibition of C-C bonding. When copper-tin electrodes are prepared by alloy plating, unlike cobalt, a solid solution or an intermetallic compound may be formed depending on the ratio of copper and tin. Since the atomic radii of tin atoms are quite different from those of copper atoms, tin atoms do not exist only in substituted solid solution as in the case of cobalt, but their crystal structure changes. The reduction properties of CO 2 electrochemical reduction at a copper-tin electrode were changed. Copper produces hydrocarbons and tin produces formic acid as the main products of CO 2 electrochemical reduction, while carbon monoxide is produced as the main product at a copper/tin ratio of 87:13. Computational chemistry studies predict that the formation of hydrocarbons by copper is via the two-electron reduction product carbon monoxide. The presence of tin near the copper atoms is considered to weaken the adsorption between copper and carbon monoxide. The modeling of the adsorption and the attempt to elucidate the cause by computational science revealed that the tin atoms are weakly bonded to the reaction intermediates and act only as the active sites for the formation of formic acid. It was found that the copper atom weakens the bond with carbon monoxide due to the presence of the tin atom next to the copper atom, and that it decreases the amount of adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. It is reported that the amount of carbon monoxide adsorbed on copper atoms is important for the formation of hydrocarbons, which is stabilized by the formation of hydrogen bonds with CHO*, the reaction intermediate to hydrocarbons. These results suggest that the adsorbed carbon monoxide is destabilized, and carbon monoxide is desorbed from the copper atom, resulting in an increase in carbon monoxide as a product.

Research on CO 2 conversion into valuable materials has attracted much attention, aiming to realize carbon neutrality and carbon-negative emission technology. It has been reported that the unique physicochemical properties of high-temperature molten salt, such as high conductivity and wide electrochemical window, make it possible to obtain solid carbon directly from CO 2 and metal carbides. In this study, we focused on the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 in high-temperature chloride melt. CaC 2 is the raw material for acetylene, the starting material for various chemical products. This study demonstrated the selective formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 by an electrochemical process in NaCl-KCl-CaCl 2 -CaO melt at 823 K to produce C 2 H 2 with high current efficiency. When the inert material for oxygen evolution in the high-temperature melts was used as the anode, the formation of acetylene and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water can be realized as the total reaction. 2CO 2 + H 2 O → C 2 H 2 + 5/2O 2 On the metal cathode, the CaC 2 was formed through two reactions: the carbon electrodeposition from CO 2 -derived CO 3 2− (Step 1) and the electrochemical reduction of Ca(II) ion on the carbon (Step 2). These two reactions could be controlled by conducting potentiostatic electrolysis under CO 2 and Ar atmospheres, resulting in acetylene synthesis with a maximum current efficiency of 92%. The electrolysis on carbon electrodes revealed that the higher the crystallinity of carbon, the more selectively CaC 2 was formed. The CaC 2 formation was induced by the reduction of Ca(II) ions on the basal plane of the graphite layer rather than the edge plane. The unique interfacial phenomenon between high-temperature melt and a carbon electrode surface will contribute to realizing a highly efficient CO 2 conversion process to acetylene. It was found that the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 tends to proceed at the basal plane of the graphite layer. This reaction mechanism is entirely different from the interlayer reactions that tend to occur in LIBs and is unique to this electrolytic system at the carbon/molten salt interface. The obtained data will provide a highly efficient process for CO 2 resource conversion and physicochemical insights into new carbon surface reactions.

Observing key intermediates directly on the catalyst surface poses a significant challenge in various photo/electrocatalytic processes, including CO 2 reduction and O 2 reduction reactions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms, it is essential to conduct combined studies utilizing complementary tools such as electrochemical characterization, computational calculations, and operando spectroscopies. Among these, time-resolved attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) stands out as particularly suited for investigating electrochemical CO 2 RR due to its ability to observe interfacial processes in real-time with high surface sensitivity. Time-resolved analysis offered by ATR-SEIRAS allows for the exploration of the kinetic relevance of intermediates and their dynamics in relation to reactants and products during the reaction. Furthermore, integrating operando spectroscopic studies with material characterization enables the correlation of intermediate behavior with catalyst conditions. In this context, I will introduce in situ time-resolved FT-IR (or ATR mode) spectroscopic techniques to capture isotopically labeled products and key intermediates generated during the photoreduction of carbon dioxide.

Systems for direct conversion of captured CO2 into CO (i.e., CO2 capture and reduction: CCR) via bifunctional catalysts have attracted attention as technologies for achieving carbon neutrality. However, the reported systems require additional heating above 623 K, which is still an issue from an ecological perspective. The present work realized selective CO production through CCR under isothermal conditions at 423 K by the application of a direct current electric field and a Pt‐Na/TiO2 catalyst. The application of an electric field to the catalyst is needed for CO2 conversion at low temperature, and the loading of both Pt and Na is required for CO2 capture and its selective reduction to CO. The obtained results open the door for greener CCR technologies that effectively utilize waste heat from power plants and industry.

The growing concerns over the high energy consumption of buildings challenge design and construction parties to grow a deeper understanding of sustainable design practices and carbon footprint reduction in construction. With emerging technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and its associated tools, it is now possible to analyze various design models and decide on their implications on environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Although these tools are effective in estimating carbon emissions in the project’s design stages, working with several material alternatives throughout the project’s life cycle requires further comprehension of how CO 2 emissions can be diminished with sustainable design decisions. This study presents a comprehensive two-step analysis linking BIM and energy analysis software to compare the impact of conventional versus sustainable design parameters and their implications on CO 2 emissions. The proposed framework includes simulating the energy consumption of commercial building case studies. Using BIM and energy analysis software, design parameters are evaluated from an energy use intensity (EUI) perspective. The implications of using the conventional versus sustainable design are reflected in a range of CO 2 emissions. The second part of the methodology includes a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the real-world case studies with and without sustainable design implications. This methodology will help designers identify the intensity of their design decisions on energy use and carbon emissions throughout the building life cycle. The seamless and user-friendly application of this framework will help design parties expedite decisions during the first stages of their projects.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) holds promise for mitigating carbon emissions and reuse CO 2 for chemical synthesis and energy storage. Among various catalysts, copper-palladium (Cu-Pd) shows potential for converting CO 2 into valuable hydrocarbons (C 2+ products). However, the efficiency of Cu-Pd catalysts is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during CO 2 RR. To tackle this issue, we have developed and analyzed Cu-Pd bimetallic catalysts with varying ratios of copper to palladium to understand the mechanisms underlying HER and its impact on CO 2 electrolyzer performance. Utilizing in-situ Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, Ex-situ Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, and X-ray Photon Spectroscopy, we have identified three detrimental effects of HER during CO 2 reduction: (i) formation of carbonate salt precipitates causing cathode clogging, (ii) mechanical damage to the ion exchange membrane, and (iii) facilitation of anode catalyst crossover. The precipitation of salts on the cathode flow field and gas diffusion layer hinders CO 2 diffusion to the catalyst surface during electrolysis. Notably, we observe catalyst crossover from the anode to the cathode, potentially exacerbating HER during CO 2 RR. These processes adversely affect the long-term durability of CO 2 electrolyzers and necessitate a comprehensive understanding and strategies for mitigation. Figure 1

Background: The treatment of glaucoma often requires numerous therapeutic modalities to achieve the desired reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). Cyclodestructive procedures or ciliary body destruction have been performed using techniques with considerable differences in efficacy and complication rates. Among these methods, cyclocryotherapy is non-invasive and simple for the management of uncontrolled glaucoma in dogs and cats. The objective of this case report is to describe the technique of carbon dioxide cyclocryotherapy to reduce intraocular pressure in dogs and cats with glaucoma.Cases: Nine canine patients and one cat with glaucoma were treated with cyclocryotherapy performed under general anaesthesia. Clinical signs patients included blepharospasm, ocular pain, episcleral congestion and ocular hypertension. The patients showed higher levels of IOP, higher than 30 mmHg. Surgical treatment with general anaesthesia was applied. The pre-anaesthesia protocol included acepromazine 0.05 mg/kg with methadone 0.2 mg/kg, followed by intravenous propofol and maintenance with isoflurane and oxygen. An ophthalmological cryocautery unit was used with carbon dioxide as the cryogenic agent and a retinal cryoprobe of 3.2 mm diameter tip for the procedure. The method used was a double cycle of freezing and thawing for 60 s in each site. The cryoprobe was centred approximately 5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus over the ciliary body. The temperature of each cyclocryotherapy spot was between -60°C and -80°C and each site was maintained in place for 60 s; 4 to 6 spots of the double freeze-thaw cycle were made. This technique did not have any serious complications during or after the application of cryotherapy, but chemosis and hyperaemia of the bulbar conjunctiva developed. Subconjunctival anti-inflammatory steroids were injected to minimise swelling and patient discomfort. Satisfactory results were observed; in all cases, the intraocular pressure decreased, with the usual result being a cosmetic and painless eye. Discussion: Even with recent surgical and medical advances, pain and blindness are still common occurrences in glaucoma in human and veterinary practice. The cyclodestructive procedures included cyclodialysis, cyclodiathermy, cyclocryotherapy, and cyclophotocoagulation. The cryosurgery in veterinary ophthalmology has many indications for the treatment of ocular diseases and is effective at decreasing intraocular pressure in patients with persistent uncontrolled glaucoma. Cyclocryotherapy has been shown to reduce intraocular pressure in dogs, cats, rabbits and humans with normotensive and glaucomatous eyes. The application of a cryoprobe over the ciliary processes results in ablating ciliary tissue so that aqueous humour inflow is reduced to acceptable levels. In the clinical cases evaluated, there was a reduction in intraocular pressure reaching acceptable levels, with the usual result being cosmetic and painless eye. Medical therapy remains the predominant method for treating glaucoma in veterinary patients; therefore, cyclocryotherapy is an effective, simple way to lower IOP and is a reasonable treatment option for glaucoma management. Cyclocryotherapy has shown good results, with a low learning curve and it can also be repeated if necessary.Keywords: eye, canine, feline, surgery.

This paper investigates the impact of road traffic-related air pollution on public health in Beijing and evaluates the effectiveness of driving restriction policies in mitigating both traffic congestion and environmental pollution. With Beijing facing severe air quality challenges due to rapid urbanization and increased vehicle use, various measures have been implemented over the years to improve air quality. The 2008 Beijing Olympics served as a catalyst for stricter emissions controls and vehicle restrictions, leading to a reduction in pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM). This study traces the evolution of these policies, assesses their effectiveness in reducing air pollution and carbon emissions, and examines the broader public health implications. The paper concludes that while significant progress has been made, further innovations such as low-emission zones and congestion pricing could help address the remaining challenges of air pollution and traffic congestion in the city.

Biochemical networks use reaction cascades to selectively reduce CO2 using energy from sunlight, but can similar selectivity be achieved by applying a cascade approach to an engineered system? Here, we report the design and implementation of a two-step photoelectrochemical (PEC) cascade to a liquid solar fuel: reduction of CO2 to CO and subsequent reduction of CO to methanol. The potentials required to perform the reductions were generated using custom-made III–V-based three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNT) catalyzed both reactions. Multiphysics simulations of electrolyte flow and nonilluminated electrochemical measurements were used to narrow the operating parameters for the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes. The champion integrated photocathode produced methanol with 3.8 ± 0.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE), with tested photocathodes having 0.7–3.8% methanol FE. Products were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The current output of the tested photocathodes was highly stable, and methanol production continued over multiple experiments. The low methanol yield is attributed to insufficient CO flux to, and CO2 depletion at, the methanol-producing subcell when both contacts are active, which is supported by the observation that a control photoelectrode slightly outperformed the methanol production of the 3TT device. Methanol production ceased when the 3TT subcell driving CO reduction was deactivated, supporting the assignment of a cascade mechanism. The major factors resulting in low methanol FE by the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes are insufficient CO2 depletion at the methanol-producing contact and uncertainty in operating potential selection using the 3TT design. Although the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathode is not yet highly selective, this work develops the basic science principles underlying the PEC cascade, demonstrates the co-design of a 3TT-based photoelectrode to produce carbon-based fuels, and finally discusses routes for improving product yields with this concept, including CO2 supply optimization and alternative photoelectrode and catalyst materials.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO 2 R) holds great promise for producing valuable chemicals and fuels while mitigating carbon emissions. However, challenges arise from the need to enhance CO 2 transport and operate at higher current densities. Despite the development of gas diffusion electrodes, operating at higher current densities generates hydroxide ions at the cathode, promoting the formation of carbonate ions, which can cause salt precipitation and flooding, hindering CO 2 mass transport. To investigate the potential degradation of eCO 2 R of copper gas diffusion electrode (Cu GDE), we utilize X-ray tomography, a nondestructive method for visualizing morphological changes. Through in-line gas chromatography, we track salt precipitation and flooding in the GDE, correlating these changes with shifts in product distribution during eCO 2 R. Our findings reveal that the degradation of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cells is linked to the extent of precipitation and flooding. Furthermore, micro-CT imaging captures morphological changes, such as precipitation growth, dissolution, and regrowth from the Cu surface to the gas diffusion layer, during transient oscillatory voltage profiles and selectivity changes in Cu GDE. This study sheds light on the degradation mechanism of MEA cells and offers insights into strategies for enhancing device durability.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to multi‐carbon (C2+) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO2 loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C2+ products due to the competing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C‐C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO2 coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO2 reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C‐C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C2+ products in strong acid. Lowering the CO2 feed concentration reduces CO2 coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C‐C coupling. This approach efficiently suppresses the formation of undesired C1 products. By employing a 20% CO2 feed, we achieved a significant improvement in C2+ Faradaic efficiency, reaching 68% at 100 mA cm‐2, approximately 1.7 times higher than the 41% obtained using pure CO2. We demonstrated the direct electroreduction of a 30% CO2 feed – representative CO2 concentration of typical industrial flue gases – in a full electrolyzer, achieving a C2+ selectivity of 78% and an energy efficiency of 23% at 200 mA cm‐2.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to multi‐carbon (C2+) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO2 loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C2+ products due to the competing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C‐C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO2 coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO2 reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C‐C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C2+ products in strong acid. Lowering the CO2 feed concentration reduces CO2 coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C‐C coupling.

Metal‐Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of solid‐state materials comprising inorganic elements and organic molecules. These hybrid materials are widely recognized for their diverse properties, rendering them indispensable in the field of organic synthesis, material science and the pharmaceutical industry. Although the traditional batch methods for MOFs synthesis are well‐developed, they often struggle with reproducibility, scalability and environmental issues. However, the development of continuous flow techniques has emerged as a promising alternative, offering more efficient mass and heat transfer, precise reaction control, greater potential for automation, improved safety, and reduced environmental impact. This review primarily focuses on advanced continuous flow synthesis of MOFs incorporating techniques such as air flow, spray drying, microwave, micro‐droplets, supercritical carbon dioxide, and ultrasound. Additionally, the recent advancements in applying MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts for various organic transformations under continuous flow conditions are discussed, categorized by the type of bond formation, including C‐H bond formation (hydrogen reduction), C‐C bond formation, and C‐O bond formation.

Abstract The manufacturing of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) significantly contributes to global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, necessitating the exploration of alternative binders like alkali-activated materials (AAM). Despite its environmental benefits, AAM generally faces challenges such as drying shrinkage and efflorescence, limiting its industrial application. This study focuses on investigating the impact of steam curing on addressing these challenges in high strength slag-based AAM. The results indicates that high strength AAM can be developed by carefully optimizing the activator-to-binder and water-to-binder ratios, and incorporating steam curing. Specifically, a compressive strength of 112.4 MPa was achieved after one day of steam curing, compared to 100.8 MPa after 28 days of standard curing. This demonstrates the ability of steam curing to accelerate strength development of AAM. Furthermore, steam curing proved to be highly effective in reducing drying shrinkage, which was decreased from 17 351 microstrains to 1 440 microstrains. This reduction aligns the shrinkage levels of AAM with those of OPC, addressing a major limitation of AAM. This study also found that efflorescence was notably mitigated, with a significant reduction observed after a 24-hour steam curing period. These findings highlight steam curing as a cost- effective and practical-effective method in improving the performance of AAM. By addressing the key challenges, steam curing facilitates the broader adoption of AAM in sustainable construction practices.

As the greenhouse effect intensifies, China faces pressure to manage CO2 emissions. Coal-fired power plants are a major source of CO2 in China. Traditional CO2 emission accounting methods of power plants are deficient in computational efficiency and accuracy. To solve these problems, this study proposes a novel RF-RFE-DF-Optuna (random forest–recursive feature elimination–deep forest–Optuna) framework, enabling accurate CO2 emission prediction for coal-fired power plants. The framework begins with RF-RFE for feature selection, identifying and extracting the most important features for CO2 emissions from the power plant, reducing dimensionality from 46 to just 5 crucial features. Secondly, the study used the DF model to predict CO2 emissions, combined with the Optuna framework, to enhance prediction accuracy further. The results illustrated the enhancements in model performance and showed a significant improvement with a 0.12706 increase in R2 and reductions in MSE and MAE by 81.70% and 36.88%, respectively, compared to the best performance of the traditional model. This framework improves predictive accuracy and offers a computationally efficient real-time CO2 emission monitoring solution in coal-fired power plants.

Aiming at the challenges of rapid heat dissipation, limited swept efficiency, and a rapid water cut increase in steam huff and puff development in heavy oil reservoirs, an alternating steam and CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff method for IOR was proposed. In this work, the effect of CO2 on the physical properties of heavy oil was evaluated, and the optimal concentration of viscosity reducer for synergistic interaction between CO2 and the viscosity reducer was determined. Next, novel huff and puff simulation experiments by three sandpack models of different sizes in series were analyzed. Then, the IOR difference between the pure steam huff and puff experiments and the steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff were compared. Finally, the CO2 storage rate was obtained based on the principle of the conservation of matter. The results show that the optimal viscosity reducer concentration, 0.8 wt%, can achieve a 98.5% reduction after combining CO2. The steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff reached about 45 cm at 80 °C in the fifth cycle due to the CO2/viscosity reducer effects. CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff significantly reduces water cut during cold production, with an ultimate IOR 15.89% higher than pure steam huff and puff. The viscosity reducer alleviates heavy oil blockages, and CO2 decreases oil viscosity and enhances elastic repulsion energy. The highest CO2 storage rate of 76.8% occurs in the initial stage, declining to 15.2% by the sixth cycle, indicating carbon sequestration potential. These findings suggest that steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff improves heavy oil reservoir development and provides theoretical guidance for optimizing steam huff and puff processes.

Construction of metal–organic cages (MOCs) with internal modifications is a promising avenue to build enzyme‐like cavities and unlocking the mystery of highly catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes. However, current interests are mainly focused on single‐metal‐node cages, little achievement has been expended to metalloclusters‐based architectures, and the in situ endogenous generation of metal clusters. Herein, based on the hard‐soft‐acids‐bases (HSAB), the metalloclusters‐based heterometallic MOC (Cu3VMOP) constructed of [Cu3OPz3]+ and [V6O6(OCH3)9(SO4)(CO2)3]2– clusters was obtained by one‐pot method. In addition, Cu4I4 was generated in situ in the cage to form Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP by the coordination‐driven hierarchical self‐assembly strategy. As catalysts for CO2 reduction, Cu3VMOP produces HCOOH and CH3COOH as the main reduction product with yield of CH3COOH up to 0.9 mmol g–1, ranking among the highest value of reported materials, whereas Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP exhibited targeted CO2‐to‐HCOOH conversion with 100% formic acid selectivity and the yield outperforms that of Cu3VMOP by 5 fold. Theoretical calculations and femtosecond time‐resolved transient absorption reveal that endogenous Cu4I4 not only regulates orbital arrangements and enhances localized electron states to generate a long‐lived charge‐separated state, but also raises *CO coupling energy barrier, resulting in the targeted conversion of CO2 to formic acid.

The urgent global challenge of climate change and the depletion of energy resources have spotlighted the technology of converting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable carbon-based products. The CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) via metal complex molecules is expected to improve and enhance the electronic/chemical environment of the catalytic active sites through control with freely modulable organic ligands. The selectivity for the formation of formic acid and carbon monoxide from CO 2 in organic solvents has been successfully controlled in some molecular catalysts by small structural differences in the ligands. For catalytic reactions in organic solvents, NMR and other common analytical methods can be used to follow structural changes and reaction intermediates during the reaction of unimolecular molecular catalysts. The study of detailed reaction processes has led to ligand design guidelines that contribute to higher reaction rates and improved selectivity. However, analytical methods still need to be developed for heterogeneous molecular catalysts used in water on electrodes. Catalysts capable of producing C 2 products, such as ethylene and ethanol, require methods to detect intermediates in multi-electron reduction processes involving C-C coupling reactions. Current C 2 producing molecular catalysts are known to decompose during reactions, turning into metals and not fully utilizing their precisely controlled active sites. Therefore, developing structurally stable molecular catalysts during reactions is critical to understanding these mechanisms. In this study, we have demonstrated a Br-bridged copper dinuclear molecular catalyst with high robustness for CO 2 /CO reduction reactions, producing C 3+ products including C 3 H 7 OH beyond C 2 products. Operando XAFS and various spectroscopic analyses show that the dinuclear molecular catalyst maintains a stable Cu(I) state during the reduction reaction, preventing decomposition. Operando spectroscopic analysis using localized surface plasmon resonance identifies key C 2 and C 3 coupling intermediates essential for C 3 production. Reaction intermediates obtained by 13 CO 2 -labeled operando analysis were also corroborated. DFT calculations propose a mechanism where the reaction proceeds at room temperature to form C 3 coupling species. The transition state structures resulting from this mechanistic analysis suggest that the progression of C-C coupling in the Cu dinuclear molecular metal complex is facilitated by the formation of a CO 2 /CO-reduced intermediate species that bridges the two Cu active sites. The bridging intermediate can adjust the Cu-Cu distance during the reaction, attracting reducing species to one Cu side and accepting substrate to the other Cu side. C 3 H 7 OH is formed through C-C coupling at the bridging site in flexible Cu binuclear structures. The discovery of a robust molecular catalyst for C 3+ production provides a molecular design guideline for developing next-generation catalysts for multicarbon CO 2 reduction products.

Fundamental studies of well-defined catalyst materials and electrolyte conditions uncover the role of the microenvironment in steering catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability. Studies of more applied platforms with greater complexity provide insights into the roles of mass transfer, flooding, and crystallization. Translating knowledge from model systems to applied platforms is key to enabling high-performance technologies in this space.

Electroreduction of CO2 to CO represents a highly promising way for artificial carbon cycling, but obtaining high selectivity over a wide potential window remains a challenge due to the sluggish CO generation and diffusion kinetics. Here we report an integration of long‐range P modified asymmetrical bismuth atomic site on an ordered macroporous carbon skeleton with mesoporous “wall” (MW‐BiN3‐POMC) for efficient electroreduction of CO2. In‐depth in‐situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the incorporation of long‐range P atom is able to strengthen the orbital interaction between the C 2p of CO2 and Bi 6p, thereby establishing an electronic transport bridge for the activation of CO2 molecule. Additionally, the ordered macropore with mesoporous wall effectively facilitates the diffusion of CO. As a result, MW‐BiN3‐POMC exhibits an ultrawide potential window of 1000 mV for high CO selectivity (>90%) and a maximal CO partial current density of 414 mA cm‐2. Moreover, MW‐BiN3‐POMC can also be employed as the cathode to integrate the solar‐driven electrolytic cell (anode of Co3O4‐OMC) toward CO2 reduction coupled with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation to simultaneously yield CO and 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid.

Abstract Photovoltaic‐driven electrochemical (PV‐EC) carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 R) coupled with sulfide oxidation (SOR) can efficiently convert the solar energy into chemical energy, expanding its applications. However, developing low‐cost electrocatalysts that exhibit high selectivity and efficiency for both CO 2 R and SOR remains a challenge. Herein, a bifunctional copper selenide catalyst is developed with copper vacancies (v‐CuSe 2 ) for the CO 2 R‐SOR. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 62.4% for methane at −200 mA cm −2 is achieved in the cathodic CO 2 R. In a two‐electrode CO 2 R‐SOR system with 16 h of long‐term operation at a current density of 200 mA cm −2 , an average Faradaic efficiency of 57.2% for methane and 97.7% for sulfur powder generation is achieved at cathode and anode, respectively. Compared to the coupling of CO 2 R with oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the energy efficiency (EE) of the CO 2 R‐SOR system can be increased to 22.9%. The mechanism study has found that the synergistic effect of copper vacancies and introduced Se significantly enhances the selectivity toward methane. Driven by silicon solar cells, a solar‐to‐methane conversion efficiency of 2% is achieved.

This study explores the environmental and economic impacts of aviation emissions, focusing on the changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using real flight data from Batman Airport, the research examines aircraft emissions, global warming potential (GWP), specific environmental impacts (SEI), and specific eco-cost (SEC) from 2018 to 2023. The analysis reveals significant reductions in total emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2, HC, CO, NOx) during 2020, while per-passenger emissions increased. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, total CO2 emissions in 2020 decreased by 31.45%, while emissions per passenger rose by 9.7%. Similar patterns were observed for HC, CO, and NOx. The pandemic-induced reduction in aviation activity led to a 32.1% decrease in GWP and a 31.7% reduction in SEC for the same period. However, the rapid recovery in 2021 saw emissions and environmental costs return to near pre-pandemic levels by 2023. This research provides valuable insights into the long-term environmental effects of reduced air travel during COVID-19 and highlights strategies to mitigate aviation-related emissions, such as reducing taxi times to loer pollutants and their associated environmental costs.

The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction provides a convenient approach to convert CO2 to CO, which facilitates to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Herein, the Cu/CeO2 catalyst prepared by a co‐precipitation method using a mixture of Na2CO3 and NaOH at pH of 10 (sample Cu/CeO2‐10) achieved an intrinsic reaction rate of 428.4 mmol•gcat‐1•h‐1 with 100% CO selectivity at 400 °C and CO2/H2 ratio of 1:4, which is much higher than Cu/CeO2 prepared by impregnation and other methods. Various characterizations showed the highest fraction of CuCeO2 solid solution in the calcined Cu/CeO2‐10, and formed highly dispersed Cu clusters (~2.5 nm) on partially reduced CuCeO2 solid solution with abundant of oxygen vacancies upon reduction. The Cu and oxygen vacancies facilitates the activation of H2 and CO2, respectively, resulting in lowered H2 and CO2 reaction orders. As a result, the synergy between the two components enhanced the overall RWGS activity with lowered activation energy. Moreover, the optimal catalyst is very stable in 24h stability test without detectable agglomeration of Cu clusters.

Despite the reductions in air travel demand during the 2020 pandemic, with a reduction of up to 80% in passenger travel during the peak pandemic period, the air travel demand has already recovered to around 80% of the pre-pandemic level, with aviation emissions in 2022 reaching around 800 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>, accounting for 2% of the global energy related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Moreover, the demand for air travel is expected to double by 2040, growing at an annual average rate of 3.4%, which means that. despite the efficiency improvement trend (average 2%/year), will almost double the aviation’s greenhouse (GHG) emissions, with a significant increase in its relative GHG share, compared to the other transport modes.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">Meanwhile the aviation sector is one of the hardest to decarbonize, with few and costly pathways available.

From a chemical perspective, the SAF is the liquid aviation fuel derived from non fossil carbon resources, such as biomass or organic derived waste feedstocks, as well as synthetic fuels produced from carbon capture and renewable energy sources. They might be currently used in blends with fossil jet fuel, with current blending limits ranging from 5% to 50%, depending on the feedstock and production pathway.

We propose a hybrid electrocatalytic-bioelectrocatalytic reaction cascade integrated on a gas diffusion electrode for CO2 reduction under selective formation of methanol. Ag-Bi2O3 selectively reduces gaseous CO2 to formate at neutral pH conditions. A subsequent enzymatic cascade comprising formaldehyde dehydro-genase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent, further reduce formate sequentially to formaldehyde and methanol. The enzymatically oxi-dized redox cofactor NAD+ is regenerated through the enzyme diaphorase which is electrochemically coupled to the electrode by embedding it into a cobaltocene-based low-potential redox polymer. Methanol formation is confirmed using a highly selective biosensor based on alcohol oxidase in combination with horseradish peroxidase integrated into a specifically adapted redox polymer. The proposed hybrid electrocatalytic-bioelectrocatalytic cascade is an example for a general strategy for enhancing the selectivity of electrocatalytic reac-tions and/or to replace bioelectrochemically challenging steps such as the synthesis of formate from CO2 using the highly oxygen-sensitive formate dehydrogenase by more robust inorganic electrocatalysts.

This study evaluates the impact of building orientation, typology, and envelope characteristics on energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in urban dwellings in subtropical climate, with a focus on Cartagena, Colombia. North-facing dwellings consistently demonstrate superior energy performance, achieving an average efficiency increase of 4.27 ± 1.77% compared to south-facing counterparts. This trend is less pronounced near the equator due to the sun’s high zenith angle. Semi-detached homes exhibit 23.17 ± 9.83% greater energy efficiency than corner houses, attributed to reduced exterior wall exposure, which lowers energy demand and CO2 emissions by 2.16 ± 0.74 kg CO2/m2 annually. Significant disparities in emissions are observed across socioeconomic strata; homes in strata 3 and 4 show the lowest emissions (6.69 ± 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), while strata 5 and 6 have the highest (10.48 ± 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), due to differences in construction quality and glazing ratios. Roofing materials also play a key role, with thermoacoustic (TAC) roofs reducing emissions by up to 5.80% in lower strata compared to asbestos–cement roofs. Furthermore, sandwich panels demonstrate substantial potential, achieving CO2 emissions reductions of up to 51.6% in strata 1 and 2 south-facing median homes and a minimum saving of 9.4% in strata 5 and 6. These findings underscore the importance of integrating energy performance criteria into public housing policies, promoting construction practices that enhance sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving occupant comfort and property value.

The increase in CO2 emissions, recognized as a global problem, is significantly influenced by energy consumption. Türkiye, which is among the developing countries, is a country dependent on foreign sources to meet its energy needs. Nevertheless, it satisfies its energy requirements through both renewable and non-renewable sources. The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the impact of consumption from renewable and non-renewable energy sources in Türkiye between 1990 and 2020 on CO2 emissions and investigate the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. We apply the traditional and structural break unit root tests to check whether the variables are stationary. We employed the newly accepted Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method to estimate the long-run relationship between variables. According to the findings, there is a U-shaped relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions. It means that the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is not applicable in Türkiye. Moreover, it concluded that non-renewable energy consumption plays a role in emission increase, while renewable energy consumption is effective in emission reduction.

The brain is highly innervated by sympathetic nerve fibres; however, their physiological purpose is poorly understood. We hypothesized that unilateral cerebral norepinephrine (NE) spillover, an index of cerebral sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), would be elevated when engaging the baroreflex [via lower-body negative pressure (LBNP; -20 and -40 Torr)] and respiratory chemoreflexes [via carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) administration (+8 Torr)], independently, and in combination. Twelve young and healthy participants (5 females) underwent simultaneous blood sampling from the right radial artery and internal jugular vein. Tritiated NE was infused through the participants' right forearm vein. Right internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery blood flow were measured using Duplex ultrasound. Unilateral cerebral NE spillover remained unchanged when only LBNP was applied (P=0.29), but increased with hypercapnia (P=0.035), and -40 Torr LBNP + CO 2 (P<0.01). There were no changes in total NE spillover during the LBNP and LBNP+CO 2 trials (both P=0.66), nor during CO 2 alone (P=0.13). No correlations were present between the increase in unilateral cerebral NE spillover during -40 Torr LBNP+CO 2 and reductions in internal carotid artery blood flow (P=0.56). These results indicate that baroreflex and respiratory chemoreflex stressors elevate cerebral SNA; however, the observed cerebral sympathetic activation has no impact on blood flow regulation in the internal carotid artery.

Electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is known to proceed at lower overpotentials with the presence of ionic liquids (ILs) in the electrolyte. However, the role of ILs in modulating CO 2 RR, even for the most studied 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF 4 ]) remains unclear. In this study, the electric field and the hydrogen bonding effects induced by [EMIM][BF 4 ] and hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), including water and a series of alcohols, in acetonitrile were examined on Ag. By employing voltammetry, in-situ enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that the initial electron transfer to CO 2 occurs at reduced overpotentials when it is confined between the [EMIM] + ring planes and the electrode surface. This confinement of CO 2 stabilizes it at the interface and enables its conversion to CO, accompanied by the generation of carbene and water as by-products. Furthermore, our findings suggest water (< 0.5 M) acts as the hydrogen bond donor as opposed to serving as the primary source of free protons. Based on this finding, we further show how the extend of hydrogen bonding as varied by various alcohols alter the microenvironment in synergy with [EMIM] + at the electrode-electrolyte interface for fine tuning of the thermodynamics of CO 2 RR. The clarified role of the imidazolium based ILs and hydrogen bond donors, and the demonstrated enhancement in CO 2 RR will advance non-aqueous electrolyte development and inform future kinetic studies.

Solar desalination efficiency can be significantly altered by combining several approaches to improve evaporation rate. The objective of this research is to find a way to make solar stills (SS) more efficient by combining evacuated tube solar collectors, blue metal stones, and corrugated fins. An investigation into a six-tube evacuated solar collector was conducted to increase the system's evaporation rate. Corrugated fins were thought of to rise the surface area of heat transfer between the water and absorber. Blue metal stone was proposed to keep the water at a maximum temperature even when solar radiation is minimal. Separate displays of the cumulative distillate output (DO) numbers and hourly values for each time period provide a comprehensive view. Based on the findings, the peak period for DO moves from 1 p.m. on a sample day in May 2024, which is six months into the project. In comparison to CSS, MSS temperature values are over 55 °C higher at the peak and nearly 26 °C higher on average. On top of that, the total DO during the day can reach 2.64 to 6.82 L, while at night it rises from 0.067 to 0.96 L. In addition, there is a 146.3% improvement in the average DO during the six months, going from 3.02 to 7.22 L. Additionally, MSS is 0.43₹ per liter and CSS is 0.47₹ per liter, in that order. The net amount of carbon dioxide reduction achieved by modified solar stills was approximately 2.44 times greater than that of conventional solar stills.

The utilization of carbide slag, an industrial by-product, as a resource to prepare value-added products has a profound impact not only for sustainable synthesis and the circular economy but also for CO2 reduction. Herein, we report the very first example of the controlled multi-dimensional assembly of calcium carbonate particles at the micrometer scale with industrial by-product carbide slag and CO2. Calcium carbonate particles of distinctly different sizes, shapes, and morphologies are obtained by finely tuning the assembly conditions. This strategy yields diverse assembled structures, including simple cubic, mulberry-like assembled unit, stacked cubic polycrystalline, and rotated polycrystalline structures, using the same starting materials. This innovative approach not only highlights the adaptability and efficiency of utilizing industrial by-products via multi-dimensional assembly but also provides new insights into the potential applications of the resulting calcium carbonate.

Abstract Dynamic resistance exercise (RE) produces sinusoidal fluctuations in blood pressure, with hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion commonly observed immediately following RE. Whether the cerebral vasculature adapts to these regular blood pressure challenges is unclear. This study examined the cerebrovascular response to post‐dynamic RE orthostasis. RE‐trained ( n = 15, female = 4) and healthy untrained individuals ( n = 15, female = 12) completed five stands: one after seated rest, with each of the subsequent four stands occurring immediately following a set of 10 repetitions of unilateral leg extension exercise at 60% of their one repetition maximum. Beat‐to‐beat blood pressure, mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv mean ) and end‐tidal carbon dioxide were measured throughout. During standing the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and MCAv mean nadirs were identified. There was no difference between groups for age (mean ± SD, 26 ± 7 RE‐trained vs. 25 ± 6 years untrained, P = 0.683) or weight (78 ± 15 vs. 71 ± 15 kg, P = 0.683). At MAP nadir during the post‐exercise stand, a greater reduction in MAP was observed in the RE‐trained group (e.g., set 4, −45 ± 11 vs. −36 ± 6 mmHg, training effect P = 0.026). However, post‐exercise stand MCAv mean at MCAv mean nadir was not different (e.g., set 4, −20 ± 7 vs. −17 ± 6 cm/s, interaction effect P = 0.478). Rate of regulation was higher in the RE‐trained group (set 1, 0.301 ± 0.170 vs. 0.167 ± 0.009, training effect P = 0.023). Despite RE‐trained individuals demonstrating greater absolute reductions in MAP during orthostasis following RE, there were no differences in MCAv mean , suggesting that habitual RE may mitigate post‐exercise cerebral hypoperfusion.    

    

## Effects of soil tillage practices on soil conservation in pasture-based integrated management systems: a case study on steep slopes in southeastern Brazil

Conservation tillage practices within integrated systems offer a viable strategy for restoring degraded pastures on slopes. This study evaluated the short-term (2 years) impacts of soil tillage types and young silvopastoral systems on soil hydrophysical properties, CO2 emissions and erosion processes in a 38% sloping area following pasture renovation. Three management systems (full-sun pasture; and silvopastoral system with eucalyptus or with gliricidia) were evaluated alongside three soil tillage types (downhill ploughing with a disc plough; contour ploughing with a mouldboard plough; and no-tillage). The results revealed that soil tillage led to bulk density and penetration resistance reductions of up to 85% compared to no-tillage. The decrease in bulk density was associated with increased total porosity (particularly macroporosity), resulting in enhanced soil water infiltration rates (up to > 76.5%). However, disturbance induced significant environmental disadvantages, including nearly twofold increases in soil losses, water losses and increased CO2 emissions (> 43%). Young silvopastoral systems demonstrated a soil hydrophysical quality comparable to full-sun pasture and did not significantly affect CO2 emissions, soil water content or temperature. Notably, no-tillage resulted in lower CO2 emissions and soil temperatures but higher soil water content, particularly when integrated with tree species, effectively minimizing soil and water losses. These findings underscore the critical role of no-tillage practices within silvopastoral systems in enhancing soil conservation, especially on erosion-prone sloping lands.

The electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2eRR) to high value-added chemicals in an aqueous electrolyte usually faces challenges, including sluggish oxygen evolution at the anode and the competing reaction of hydrogen evolution at the cathode. A novel CoNi@NC composite with high saturation magnetization, prepared by facile pyrolysis, was used as the cathode and a Pt sheet as the anode in an ionic liquid (IL)-methanol electrolyte to conduct the CO2eRR to produce CH4 and CO, and oxidation of methanol to generate methylal (dimethoxymethane, DMM). A magnetic CoNi alloy nanomaterial (CoNi@NC) with a nitrogen-doped carbon layer-coated structure was synthesized by a one-pot method. The system achieved an associative strategy for synchronous production of high-valued chemicals via two half-reactions at the cathode and anode, respectively. The optimal CoNi@NC composite exhibited efficient catalytic activity, obtaining an average of 54.5% faradaic efficiency (FE) for DMM within 48 h and 91.9% of momentary FE for CO and CH4 at 24 h under lower energy consumption. The electrode catalyst and ionic liquid electrolyte also exhibited good recyclability and stability in the CO2eRR. Mechanism studies indicated that magnetic CoNi alloy species served as adsorption and active sites for CO2 conversion. In addition, the carbon layer coating enhanced the stability of the CoNi alloy, and N-doping introduced surface defects on the carbon layer, thereby promoting CO2 adsorption and electrocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the magnetic CoNi (1 1 1) species was conducive to CO2 adsorption and activation, exhibiting high selectivity for the CO2eRR.

Abstract Electric vehicle (EV) deployment provides an opportunity to reduce emissions in Texas, which has the greatest transportation emissions in the United States. This study aims to evaluate the impact of light-duty EV (LDEV) adoption through a capacity expansion model of the Texas power grid (Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT). Particularly, this work investigates how various LDEV adoption rates and charging strategies (i.e., managed and unmanaged) affect the electricity generation capacity mix, hourly dispatch, transmission capacity, carbon emissions, and costs in ERCOT. Our findings show that unmanaged charging strategies can lead to 30%–70% cumulative tailpipe CO2 emission reductions in the power and transportation sectors by 2050, depending on whether the LDEV adoption is 50% or 100%, respectively. These CO2 reductions are associated with 2.5%–6.7% increases in total power system costs compared to a scenario with no EV adoption. Furthermore, we find that managed charging can lead to 10% less transmission capacity compared to unmanaged charging in the complete LDV electrification scenarios. These results indicate that policies incentivizing EV adoption and managed charging strategies can facilitate sustainable decarbonization in the transportation sector while minimally increasing costs relative to a scenario without increased EV adoption.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 is promising for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage but confronts low CH4 selectivity, especially at high current densities. The key challenge lies in promoting *CO intermediate and *H coupling while minimizing side reactions including C‐C coupling or H‐H coupling, which is particularly difficult at high current density due to abundant intermediates. Here we report a cooperative strategy to address this challenge using Cu‐based catalysts comprising Cu‐N coordination polymer and CuO component that can simultaneously manage the key intermediates *CO and *H. A fast CO2‐to‐CH4 conversion rate of 3.14 mmol cm‐2 h‐1 is achieved at 1,300 mA cm−2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.7%. In‐situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations show that the increased Cu‐Cu distance in the Cu‐N coordination polymer component favors multistep *CO hydrogenation over the dimerization, and the CuO component ensures an adequate supply of *H, together contributing to the selective CO2‐to‐CH4 conversion at high current densities. This work develops a cooperative strategy for the electrosynthesis of CH4 with simultaneous high current density and high selectivity by rational catalyst design, paving the way for its applications.

CO 2 emissions have become a series problem since the industrial revolution, the detrimental effect of CO 2 emissions raise people’s awareness in recent years. Scientists are eagerly searching the sustainable energy as the replacement of the petrochemical industry. The carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) can reduce the CO 2 amount in the atmosphere as well as generating the valuable carbon-based chemicals spontaneously, which is a strong potential way for the next generation green energy. In our work, we suggested a strategical design of the copper cathode in the zero-gap membrane electrolyte assembly (MEA) electrolyzer of CO 2 RR, the electrolyte-free cathodic environment caused the consequence of inefficient and ineffective activation. The magnesium oxide (MgO) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2 ) incorporated with the copper oxide (CuO) as the initial catalyst (CuO-MgO/Mg(OH) 2 ), with the manipulation of three gradually increasing potential range of cyclic voltammetry (CV) as the break-in process, the MgO/(OH) 2 totally dissolved when contacting the located CO 2 (g) and H 2 O (l) crossed from the anode which brought by the cation through the electric field attraction. The absent of the dissolved MgO/Mg(OH) 2 would provide the sufficient triple-phase boundary, with the accessible reactant CO 2 (g) and H 2 O (l) and proper local environment, the high surface area copper (HSA-Cu) eventually creating a proper condition for CO 2 RR. The high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) 276 μC/cm 2 and 11.3 mF/cm 2 had been proved in the monolayer copper oxidation redox detection and capacitance double layer (C dl ) measurement, respectively. The HSA-Cu had outstanding performance of the partial current density j C2H4 = 44.7 mA/cm 2 at 3.0 V and Faradaic efficiency FE C2H4 = 27.3 % at 2.8 V for C 2 H 4 product.

Purpose: The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality in Vietnam. Methodology: The research employed is the non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) approach, utilizing time-series data from 1986 to 2022. The strength of NARDL lies in its consideration of both increasing and decreasing trends in independent variables such as Economic Growth, Energy from Renewable Resources and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in a non-linear relationship with the dependent variable, CO2. Findings: The research findings indicate that overall economic growth is positively associated with an increase in CO2 emissions, aligning with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory in the first stage of the inverted U-shape. However, the EKC hypothesis is not supported in later stages, as environmental degradation persists despite economic growth. Renewable resources in primary energy have increased from 6% in 1986 to 16% in 2022, while FDI has risen from 0.03% of GDP in 1986 to 4.3% of GDP in 2021, resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions. In other words, the Pollution Haven Hypothesis does not hold in Vietnam. With a net-zero CO2 target by 2050, Vietnam necessitates rapid, short-term changes to neutralize carbon emissions effectively in the long term. Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: To simultaneously ensure economic growth while adhering to Vietnam's carbon neutrality objectives, followings solutions are recommended: (1) increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources and reducing fossil fuel dependency; (2) incorporating modern, environmentally friendly technologies in the industrial sector to diminish resource-intensive practices and reduce dependence on fossil fuels; (3) establishing a legal framework and conditions to attract FDI in technology-intensive sectors, thereby mitigating carbon emissions.

Stabilizing GHG emissions in the agri-food sector is crucial for climate change mitigation. Tea is one of the most consumed drinks worldwide and such high levels of consumption necessitate for the carbon footprint (CF) assessment of its entire life cycle encompassing all six stages such as cultivation, processing, packaging, transportation, consumption and disposal to understand the environmental impact of tea industry at large. In this context, this study is a maiden attempt to quantify and compare CF for the entire life cycle of all three types of tea such as black, green and white tea in a single research paper by employing the life cycle assessment (LCA) method in significant tea growing areas of Tamil Nadu, India. The findings revealed that the consumption stage contributed the highest CO2 emissions, accounting for 45%-56% to overall CF. Black tea consumption contributed 45% (5.8 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea) of the total CF, while green tea and white tea had higher CF (8.3 kg CO?-eq/kg of made tea), contributing 56% to the total CF. The processing stage was the second largest source, contributing 12-19% to overall CF, followed by packaging (15-17%) and cultivation (10-11%) stages. Overall, the total CF (cradle to grave) for black tea and white tea had a similar value of 12.9 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea, whereas green tea registered a higher value of 14.79 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea. Furthermore, this assessment identified hotspots of GHG emissions. It enabled the recommendation of CF reduction measures to promote carbon neutrality in tea sector while being a part of global climate change mitigation efforts.

The steel industry is responsible for a very large environmental impact because more than 70% of the production of iron is done in blast furnaces, where the reduction of iron oxides (ore) is performed with carbon monoxide obtained from coke and coal. Their partial oxidation produces CO used to reduce the iron oxides, simultaneously yielding huge amounts (approximately 2GT/a) of CO2. It is necessary to find new alternatives to decarbonize the steelmaking process. The present work studies the reduction kinetics of iron oxides using hydrogen as a reductant. The overall reaction displays complex behavior that explains the versatile and partly contradictory interpretations found in the literature on hydrogen reduction of iron oxides. Experiments in thin layers of powder were performed under various experimental conditions to investigate the kinetics with both pure iron oxide and an industrial feedstock. To support the interpretation of the data, morphological and chemical-physical characterization was performed, and a comparison between pure hematite and commercial ironmaking pellets was reported.

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has been widely acknowledged as a key component in the global transition from fossil energy to renewable energy powered society to combat climate change. Cu is the only metal capable of converting CO 2 to valuable multicarbon products with decent yields. Despite intense research efforts, mechanistic understanding of Cu-catalyzed CO 2 RR remains incomplete. A key point with impactions for catalyst design is whether the CO 2 -to-CO conversion and the further conversion of CO are independent steps in the reaction network of the CO 2 RR. In this talk, I will discuss our recent results showing that the presence of CO 2 enhances the Cu-catalyzed CORR to multicarbon products, and intriguingly, not by acting as an additional surface of carbon. Co-electrolysis studies show that there are at least two types of Cu sites with distinct activities, with one type favoring the CO 2 -to-CO conversion (Cu CO2 ), and the other more active in the CORR (Cu CO ). Analysis based a proposed two-site model shows that CO adsorbed on Cu CO is at least six times more active in the formation of multicarbon products than that on Cu CO2 . Experiments conducted on single crystal Cu facets suggest that Cu CO2 corresponds to Cu(111)-like sites and Cu CO is associated with undercoordinated Cu sites.

In this study, we employed EC‐MS to elucidate the role of halide anions in electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction. We found that the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was significantly suppressed by the anion used. Specifically, the rates of H2 production decreased in the order KF > KCl > KI, meaning that I− most strongly suppressed HER. Interestingly, CO reduction products showed an inverse relationship to HER, with KI leading to the highest rate of CO reduction. By pairing our experimental findings with classical molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism wherein halide anions influence the dynamic interplay between CO reduction and HER by modulating the competition of H* and CO* for active sites on the Cu surface. We propose that this interaction is enabled by the interfacial concentration of K+ being greater in the presence of F− than in I−. Our results highlight the need to more broadly consider the properties of ions at electrocatalytic interfaces and they point to thus far underappreciated avenues to optimize hydrocarbon production while suppressing hydrogen evolution.

Cu-based materials are regarded as effective electrocatalysts for CO2RR; however, Cu+, the active site for C–C coupling, is unstable under reduction conditions. Herein, Mg2+ is doped into the Cu2O/CuO interface and generates high-activity Cu+–O-Mg2+ sites following electrochemical activation. The electron-withdrawing effect of Mg2+ in the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site stabilizes Cu+ and optimizes the reaction pathway for CO2RR. At a partial current density of 567.21 ± 5.18 mA cm–2, the Faraday efficiency (FE) for C2+ products can reach 81.03 ± 0.74%. In situ Raman and in situ infrared spectroscopy reveal that the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site significantly enhances the coverage and stability of *CO, which contributes to the ultrahigh selectivity of CO2 toward C2+ products. Density functional theory (DFT) studies indicate that *CO2 is readily adsorbed on the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site, facilitating the more effective generation of *CO, which subsequently promotes the electrochemical C–C coupling step and accelerates the production of C2+ products.

Pumps in fuel oil systems are mechanical equipment used for the transfer of liquid fluid from one place to another. In particular, pumps are required to transfer the maximum flow rate in the transfer units in minimum time. They consume a very high amount of energy for this transfer. In this research, research studies were carried out to ensure the transfer of the highest possible amount of fuel oil by consuming energy at optimal rates. In this experimental study, the energy consumption and flow rate were measured across a range of engine speeds (100-700 RPM) and varying gear lengths (90-100 mm). According to the findings, energy consumption reached ideal levels at 600 RPM engine speed. In addition, it was determined that the lowest CO2 emission was obtained in the range of 600-700 RPM and by using long gear length. In addition, it is observed that the effect of gear length on energy efficiency is significant and energy consumption decreases as the gear length gets shorter. The results show that minimum energy consumption can be obtained with maximum flow rate at 609 RPM engine speed and 100 mm gear length. The ANOVA analysis used in the study reveals that the flow rate changes are 98% related to the engine speed, while the gear length is 78% effective in CO2 emission reduction. This research provides an important contribution to energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in industrial applications. This study provides an innovative method that can be used to achieve energy saving and environmental sustainability goals and makes valuable contributions to the literature on optimising internal gear pump designs.

Photoelectrochemical biohybrids combine the advantages of light harvesting semiconductors and biocatalysts into a single compact device. However, limited device stability, the use of toxic elements and non-innocent external components (buffers, mediators or sacrificial reagents) makes a sustainable artificial photosynthetic reaction, where fuel production is coupled to water oxidation, difficult to achieve. Here, we introduce organic photoelectrodes connected to an inverse opal TiO2 matrix that hosts efficient hydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase, driving direct solar fuel synthesis. By co-immobilising carbonic anhydrase, supported by simulations and spectroscopic investigations, the PCE10:EH-IDTBR photobiocathodes generate unprecedented photocurrent densities of up to −8 mA cm−2 in a pH neutral bicarbonate solution, attaining stable H2 production or selective CO2-to-formate conversion over 10 h. Semi-artificial photosynthesis is achieved by assembling the photobiocathode with a BiVO4 photoanode in an artificial leaf device for unassisted CO2 reduction coupled to O2 evolution, attaining a faradaic yield of 87% over 24 h of operation.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 has the potential to convert CO 2 into carbon-based fuels by using renewable energy. For many years, copper based cathodes have been highlighted as the quintessential electrocatalytic surface for CO 2 reduction (exemplified by the work of Hori). While gas-diffusion electrodes have shown than industrially relevant reaction rates can be achieved using relatively simple cathode materials, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the behaviour of copper cathodes in aqueous solutions. In particular, a review of the literature reveals that a very wide range of product selectivities are found at seemingly similar conditions (Figure 1). Rather surprisingly this review shows that sometimes copper can have almost no activity for CO 2 reduction and instead evolve almost pure H 2 . Our own measurements confirm this unexpected behaviour, with replicate experiments revealing occasions where identically mechanically polished copper electrodes favour hydrogen evolution over CO 2 reduction. In this presentation, we will discuss the reproducibility of CO2 reduction and the steps taken to explain copper’s highly variable product selectivity.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of sunlight into a chemical energy of hydrogen (H 2 ) through water splitting has been studied extensively to achieve production of storable and transportable energy sources from sunlight. Reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) using water (H 2 O) as an electron source into a more reduced chemical species is also an important subject for utilization of solar energy because of its possible production of energy-rich carbonaceous compounds without the use of fossil resources. Among the various possible systems, a coupling of two different semiconductor electrodes termed a Z-scheme system has been studied as an attractive concept in recent years. For the photocathode side in the Z-scheme system, Cu-based selenides and sulfides and their mixed forms of selenosulfides crystallized in chalcopyrite and kesterite structures, which were originally used as photovoltaic materials, were shown to be effective upon modifications on their surfaces for inducing water reduction. A ternary chalcopyrite CuGaSe 2 is one of the attractive materials for this application because of its wide bandgap energy (1.67 eV) for achieving a positive onset potential for water reduction. However, compared to other narrow-gap chalcopyrite- and kesterite-based systems such as CIGS (Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 , a marked improvement of PEC performance over the CuGaSe 2 -based photocathode has not been achieved. In this study, PEC activity for water reduction (H 2 liberation) over a co-evaporated CuGaSe 2 compact thin film modified with a CdS layer and Pt deposits under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) radiation was evaluated, specifically focusing on the impact of a Cu-deficient layer (CDL) loaded on the top part of the CuGaSe 2 film. It was found that the intentional loading of the CDL with an appropriate thickness was effective for achieving a large current flow and relatively positive photocurrent onset. The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) reached 6.6% over the best photocathode used. Moreover, the highest photocurrent onset potential of more than 0.9 V vs. RHE was achieved over the photocathode based on the CuGaSe 2 film having an extremely thick CDL (200 nm) with a relatively thick CdS layer (90 nm) due to efficient spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, though the thick CDL was also detrimental for efficient photoabsorption of CuGaSe 2 , resulting in appreciable decrease in photocurrent densities when compared to those obtained over photocathodes based on CuGaSe 2 films covered with a relatively thin CDL. Furthermore, an appreciable increase in current density was observed by applying intentional doping of rubidium (Rb), leading to the best STH of 8%. Although further investigation is required, increase in porosity at the heterointerface induced by the Rh doping would contribute for the result. Therefore, regulation of properties at the p-n heterointerface should be important for designing chalcopyrite- photocathodes for further improvements of PEC parameters of water reduction. The concept would also be applicable for preparations of the other PEC devices aiming for water oxidation as well as CO 2 reduction.

Electrochemical reduction of CO 2 is a promising method for converting a greenhouse gas into value-added products, utilizing renewable energy. Novel catalysts, electrode assemblies, and cell configurations are all necessary to achieve economically appealing performance. In this talk, I am going to present a zero gap electrolyzer cell, which converts gas phase CO 2 to products without the need for any liquid catholyte. I will demonstrate how multiple cells are connected into a stack, thus scaling up the electrolysis process. I will show how proper cell components and operational conditions result in industrially relevant performance. I will demonstrate the role of each component of the membrane electrode assembly, such as the catalysts, the porous transport layers, the membrane, and the ionomers. In the second part of my talk, I will show that while precipitate formation in the cathode gas diffusion electrode is detrimental for the long-term stability, the presence of alkali metal cations at the cathode improves performance. To overcome this contradiction, I will present different approaches which help to extend the lifetime of the electrolyzer cell. I will also present a detailed electrolyte and water balance of the operational cell, to better understand the contributing factors to these phenomena. As an outlook, I will present a complex machine learning based approach, through which we aim to find the optimal operating conditions of such CO2 electrolyzer cells. Finally, I will share the most recent insights on our containerized prototype CO2 electrolyzer system, capable of processing 100 t CO2/year.

A major concern within modern society is the need to substitute the fossil fuels with more renewable sources of the energy. Chemical industry is one of major players in the field of the usage of the crude oil to produce more complex chemicals. Despite of being good source of carbon species, a dropping amount of the coal and oil is raising the questions for future solutions. Carbon dioxide can be promising and sustainable source of carbon, but its high C-O bond energy (806 kJmol -1 ) poses general problems in efficient utilization. The most common feedstock in chemical synthesis is the syngas, a mixture of H 2 and CO, which can be simply processed into more complex molecules like e.g., methanol, dimethyl ether, or methane. Highly inert CO 2 can be transformed into more valuable CO via, so called, Reverse Water-Gas Shift Reaction (RWGS). Even though there are couple proposed CO 2 activation mechanisms, and knowledge on the reaction is quite high, the common issue is still proper selection of the catalyst for the reaction. In the surface redox mechanism Cu metal is being oxidized by CO 2 to form Cu 2 O with the release of CO. After that, Cu + ions are getting reduced back to metallic copper using surrounding H 2 . Solid Oxide Cells can become good source of ‘green’ hydrogen and, at the same time, perform direct electrolysis or chemical reduction of CO 2 . High temperature, at which SOECs are working, is beneficial from the point of Faradaic efficiency and CO 2 conversion rate. Steam electrode of SOEC contains copious amount of nickel. It is also a well-known catalyst for many reactions, but in this case the electrodes are struggling under carbon-rich atmosphere. Therefore, an addition of different catalytic materials is needed. Commonly used are mixed catalytic heterogenous systems composed of Cu supported on oxide materials e.g., Fe x O y , MoO 3 , La 2 O 3 , and many more. In this study a series of catalysts for SOECs were fabricated based on the Cu-doped double perovskite structure able to exsolve intermixed Cu or Cu-Fe nanoparticles supported on the matrix lattice of La 0.3 Sr 1.7 Fe 1.5 Mo 0.5 O 6-σ denoted as LSFM. The usage of LSFM compound as a matrix for Cu exsolution was based on the idea that it already consists of the oxides, which are currently utilized as the catalysts in RWGS. On the other hand, quite high mixed ionic-electronic conductivity may lead to even more enhanced electrochemical activity of the compound. The samples with varying Cu dopant level (5-20 mol.%) were synthesized via modified Pechini method maintaining fixed Fe:Mo ratio. Selected powders were processed into inks and screenprinted onto Ni-YSZ electrode. During the startup procedure of the SOEC, the catalysts were activated and the exsolution of metallic nanoparticles occurred. The powders and catalytic layers were characterized using XRD, SEM, and XPS techniques in both oxidized and reduced states. Doped compounds were able to exsolve metallic nanoparticles with the coverage density and size depending on the initial Cu amount in the lattice and the temperature of the reduction. Additional Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation (TPR/TPO) tests were performed to better understand the formation mechanism of surficial nanoparticles. SOECs equipped with additional layer of LSFM-Cu on the fuel electrode were examined for the performance in coelectrolysis mode under flowing H 2 O-CO 2 with subsequent measurement of the outlet gases concentration using GC-MS. New layer altered the production of syngas concerning H 2 :CO ratio, yield, selectivity and conversion rates. The anchoring effect of the exsolution process causes higher integration of the nanoparticles compared to conventional catalysts produced via simple deposition and most likely limits the evaporation and surface diffusion of copper. LSFM-Cu can be promising material for increasing the efficiency of the SOECs.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to alleviating global warming and emerging energy crises. Yet, the CO2RR efficiency is impeded by the need for electrocatalysts with good selectivity and efficiency. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention in electrocatalysis and are more efficient than traditional metal-based catalysts. In this study, we modeled a Cu single atom embedded on MoX2 (X = Se and Te) monolayer with a single chalcogen (X) vacancy as SAC. Employing the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) method, the electrocatalytic CO2RR activity of the Cu-MoX2 SACs is systematically investigated through significant descriptors, such as the Gibbs free energy change, charge density difference, and COHP analysis. The stability of SACs, CO2 adsorption configurations, and all possible reaction pathways for the formation of C1 products (HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, and CH4) were examined. All of the Cu-MoX2 SACs are stable and show high catalytic selectivity for the CO2RR by significantly suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We found that the catalytic activity is mainly due to the level of antibonding states filling between the Cu atom and *OCHOH intermediate. Among the C1 products, CH4 is selectively produced in all three SACs. Notably, there is a decrease in the limiting potential (UL) when X changes from S to Te in Cu-MoX2. Among these three SACs, Cu-MoTe2 SAC is the most promising catalyst for reducing CO2 to CH4, with as low as UL of −0.34 V vs RHE. Our results demonstrate that the local coordination environment in SACs has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of CO2RR.

The purpose of this study was to develop a fuzzy logic controller (FLC)-based energy management strategy for battery electric vehicles that enables them to reduce their energy consumption and carbon emission levels without sacrificing their performance. An electric vehicle model was developed in MATLAB/Simulink using a virtual battery and validated with real-world driving tests to save time and money. An in-depth investigation is conducted on both virtual and real vehicles to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy. This study shows that by using FLC-based energy management, an energy consumption advantage of 9.16% can be achieved while maintaining acceptable performance levels in real-world driving conditions. This advantage results in significant reductions annually: 1044.09 tons of CO2 emissions, USD 164,770.65 in savings for electric bus lines, and 5079 battery cycles. For European passenger electric vehicles, this corresponds to 405,657.6 tons of CO2 emissions reduced, USD 64,017,840 saved, and 5.071 battery cycles per vehicle. This strategy not only enhances energy efficiency but also contributes to long-term sustainability in public transportation systems, particularly for electric bus fleets, which play a critical role in urban mobility.

Low-temperature proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are poised to undergo rapid expansion in the coming decades for clean hydrogen production. Hydrogen has been hailed as the ‘Swiss Army knife’ of decarbonization as it can help mitigate carbon dioxide emissions from ammonia production, metal refining, and heavy-duty vehicle transportation. Proliferation of clean hydrogen production necessitates large reductions in iridium loadings in the anode while also operating at higher current density values. The latter goal can be achieved by adopting thinner proton exchange membranes (PEMs), but the use of thinner membranes exacerbates hydrogen crossover – which leads to unacceptable levels of hydrogen in the anode effluent poising safety concerns (i.e., above the lower explosion limit of 4 vol% hydrogen in oxygen). Notably, the hydrogen content in the anode effluent is high when operating the PEMWE at low current density values (0.1 to 0.5 A cm -2 ). A PEMWE will sometimes throttle down and operate at low current density because of the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources which are used to power the electrolyzer. Recombination catalyst (RC) interlayers, located within the PEM, can consume hydrogen and mitigate the hydrogen concentration in the anode effluent. This Talk presents our continuum-level modeling approach for hydrogen crossover in PEMWEs with membranes containing RC interlayers. The model accurately captures the hydrogen content in the anode effluent as a function of the PEMWE current density, cathode back pressure, membrane thickness, anode backpressure, RC location, and RC loading. The modeling results, as well as experimental observations in the literature, suggest that RC interlayer effectiveness is limited by oxygen availability at the RC interlayer. The low oxygen concentration at the interlayer relative to hydrogen arises from the lower solubility of oxygen in hydrated PEMs and the lower diffusivity of oxygen in hydrated PEMs. The Talk concludes with future directions to improve the model as well as suggestions for future experiments to aid the accuracy of the model.

The electrification of the petrochemical industry will greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing of commodity chemicals; however, electrification on a global scale is only achievable using earth-abundant materials for electrocatalysis in place of state-of-the-art catalysts made from precious metals. A promising catalyst that has been used for industrial hydrodesulfurization and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, nitrate reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and oxygen evolution is Ni 2 P. Ni 2 P and other transition metal phosphides benefit from active site ensembles that moderate the binding of reaction intermediates, making them promising electrocatalysts for reactions beyond the ones listed, especially other hydrogenation reactions. However, Ni 2 P and other TMPs are susceptible to oxidation, which can lead to catalyst degradation and loss in certain conditions. Stability is an important part of catalysis; therefore, it is important to understand the degradation mechanism of Ni 2 P in order to mitigate corrosion, accurately predict surface reactivity, and prepare Ni 2 P for industrial electrocatalysis. Previous reports on Ni-P alloys found passivation regimes through anodic polarization but others saw complete dissolution at more oxidizing potentials. Bulk nickel phosphides have been shown to have a passivated surface, and characterization, often limited to ex-situ spectroscopy after the fact, has shown that the surface is composed of nickel hydroxides, phosphates, and oxyhydroxides. In the present work, operando Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and polarization are combined to understand the electrochemical degradation of Ni 2 P nanoparticles. Ni 2 P nanoparticles were synthesized by heating NiCl 2 and tris(diethylamino)phosphine in oleylamine and thermally annealed at 450 °C under 5% H 2 /95% N 2 . Transmission-mode Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy was conducted on benchtop spectrometers (easyXAFS) using a 3D-printed electrochemical cell designed for operando spectroscopy. Nanoparticles maximize surface to bulk atom ratio, which is beneficial both for electrocatalysis, less atoms are necessary to have the same number of active sites, and for X-ray absorption, spectra are more surface sensitive. The use of a benchtop spectrometer offers the flexibility to iterate on experiments on the fly and the power to acquire synchrotron quality data on a routine basis. Preliminary results in neutral phosphate buffered electrolyte indicate that Ni 2 P significantly oxidizes and dissolves at and beyond 0.8 V vs RHE which agrees with anodic polarization corrosion experiments. Ongoing work extends anodic polarization experiments to acidic and basic pH and probes the potentials at which oxidation is no longer reversible. We hypothesize that dissolution will be less severe with increased pH and reduction of oxidized species to Ni 2 P will no longer be possible after the onset of Ni dissolution.

The process of conversion ethylene through carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) shows potential in catalysis by encouraging the formation of C-C bonds while reducing the occurrence of competing reactions(1). Despite their potential, a deeper understanding of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems is needed due to their low selectivity. The MEA configuration, which eliminates the need for a catholyte, delivers humidified CO 2 to the cathode, enhancing CO 2 solubility and minimizing overall ohmic resistance by maintaining a narrow electrode gap, thus boosting energy efficiency(2). However, in MEA, since protons and ions from the anolyte for reaction are supplied to the catalyst through a membrane, additional understanding of the electrolyte supply effect is needed to optimize the overall system(3). Ions and water of electrolytes are essential for CO 2 RR. Water serves as a proton source for CO 2 RR and facilitates ion transport. However, the delicate balance of water is crucial in CO 2 RR systems. While water is necessary for proton supply, an excess of water at the cathode can lead to complications, particularly in promoting the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)(4). HER can occur alongside CO 2 RR and consume protons and electrons, thereby reducing the selectivity of CO 2 conversion and diminishing overall efficiency. Balancing the concentrations of ions and water is crucial for optimizing cell voltage and overall performance, highlighting the necessity of effective water and ion management approaches. While much research on water management has focused on cathodes, electrolytes, and membranes, the properties of the anodes have been relatively neglected. This study proposes the hypothesis that modulation of the anode electrode can have a significant impact on CO 2 RR performance. When comparing Ti-mesh, which facilitates the passage of electrolyte, with carbon paper, which restricts electrolyte movement, localized pH changes and optimal ethylene production efficiency were observed. In particular, in situ/operando analysis shows that under conditions of insufficient water and ion supply, local pH effects are promoted and Cu valence increases during CO 2 RR, resulting in optimal ethylene production efficiency at low current densities. However, at high current densities, the reaction was not evenly distributed and catalytic activity decreased. On the other hand, when water and ions are supplied smoothly, the ethylene production efficiency increases as the current density increases, showing that the material is sufficiently transferred. In addition, it was confirmed through the backside image that water crossed over to the cathode at the same time. This shows that the anode can affect the catalytic activity of the cathode side. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of effective ion and water management in improving CO 2 RR efficiency in MEA and highlights the central role of the anode in this process.

One of the solutions contributing to the development of energy independence is the utilization of biogas as an alternative fuel for agricultural tractors. Biogas is recognized as a renewable energy source, and its usage aids in the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale. The reuse of this material/waste exemplifies the concept of a circular economy. Several models of agricultural tractors designed explicitly for biogas utilization or adaptable for its use are available in the market. This study aimed to evaluate the energy-ecological parameters of the MP tractor (T6.180 Methane Power) powered by Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in comparison to its structurally identical counterpart fueled by Diesel (T6.180 Electro Command). Based on the Air–Fuel Ratio (AFR) coefficients for diesel and methane, as well as values of air excess ratios (λ) and the proportions of CO and CO2 emissions determined for various engine load states, the mass emission of selected exhaust components for the examined tractors was estimated. This research highlights that biogas-powered tractors hold the potential to contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture through the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in farm energy autonomy, and optimal resource utilization, closely aligned with the principles of a circular economy.

In the context of new power systems, the rapid development of distributed renewable energy and the drive of dual carbon targets have prompted community-level clean energy and energy storage configuration to become the key to improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Based on the regional autonomy balance and sharing mechanism, this paper establishes a community distributed energy and energy storage optimization configuration model. With the goal of minimizing the total operating cost of the community, the established model is linearized by using the Big-M method and the McCormick method and transformed into a mixed integer linear programming model that is easy to solve. In order to comprehensively evaluate the comprehensive benefits of the established optimization scheme, this paper introduces the indicators of clean energy self-consumption rate, load self-supply rate, static investment payback period, and static CO2 investment payback period from the aspects of energy utilization, the economy, and the environment. Finally, a calculation example analysis is conducted, and the results show that, compared with the scenario where energy storage is configured separately and distributed energy resources are not shared, the configuration strategy proposed in the article can reduce the energy storage configuration capacity by 46.6% and the distributed energy configuration capacity by 21.1%. Investment costs can be reduced by 15.6%. At the same time, 91.75% of distributed energy self-consumption and 96.80% of load self-supply are achieved, reducing grid interaction and promoting regional autonomy and balance. The static CO2 investment payback period is also significantly shortened, and the carbon emission reduction effect is significant, providing an important reference for community energy system optimization planning and green and low-carbon development.

Due to the high environmental burden of plastics, this study aimed to evaluate the environmental performance of chemical recycling of plastic waste through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), focusing on pyrolysis oil production as the primary output. A pyrolysis plant in Almería, Spain, was chosen as a case study. The results indicate that the production of 1 L of pyrolysis oil from plastic waste generates about 0.032 kg CO2 eq and a water consumption of 0.031 m3, with other impact categories registering values of less than 0.1 kg/L or 0.01 m2a crop eq/L, reducing impacts in 17 out of 18 categories compared to fossil diesel. In addition, its chemical and physical properties, close to those of fossil diesel, suggest its suitability for internal combustion engines, although as a blend rather than a complete substitute. Chemical recycling also appears to be more environmentally favorable than incineration and landfilling in all 18 impact categories, achieving significant benefits, including a reduction in global warming of −3849 kg CO2 eq/ton, ionizing radiation of −22.4 kBq Co-60 eq/ton, and fossil resource consumption of −1807.5 kg oil eq/ton. These results, thus, highlight the potential dual role of chemical recycling of plastic waste, both in mitigating environmental impacts and in supporting circular economy goals by reducing demand for virgin plastics. However, although it appears to be a promising technology, challenges associated with high energy requirements, raw material variability, and scale infrastructure still need to be addressed to ensure industrial competitiveness and significant environmental benefits.

This study investigates the effects of adding steam to the oxidizer on the combustion behavior of coke oven gas through numerical simulations. The analysis used the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Ansys Fluent. The results obtained for the case where dry air was used as the oxidizer were compared with experimental data. The k-Ɛ standard turbulence model was employed for turbulence modeling, while the PDF/Mixture Fraction combustion model and the P-1 radiation model were used for the three-dimensional numerical simulations. According to the simulation results, adding steam to the oxidizer slightly reduced the temperature of the COG. When assessing the emissions, it was observed that NOX emissions significantly decreased, while CO2 emissions showed a slight reduction. However, CO emissions were found to increase slightly. In conclusion, the study indicates that adding steam to the oxidizer significantly mitigates the high NOX emissions typically associated with using coke oven gas as an alternative fuel.

Electrochemistry has become a key player in establishing a global sustainable energy landscape. Unfortunately, most electrochemical processes are limited in their efficiency and selectivity which has prevented them from replacing carbon-intensive industrial processes. Computational simulations have the potential to conquer the vast chemical space and reveal so far unconsidered new electrocatalysts and boost the performance of these devices. This, however, requires the knowledge of computationally accessible activity and selectivity descriptors. In this work, and by the example of electrochemical CO2 reduction, it is shown that the conventionally considered adsorption energy descriptor is not enough to distinguish product selectivity among catalysts. Including specifically the electrochemical environment in the quantum chemical calculations, we find that a charge-transfer descriptor is separately re- quired, such as the work function or the potential of zero charge. With this, experimental trends in product selectivity can be well described, thus providing a new set of descriptors for high-throughput screening of electrocatalysts.

The role of hydrogen is emphasized in many countries' energy and climate strategies, yet the impacts of regional hydrogen-supporting policies remain underexplored. This study analyzes recently announced hydrogen-supporting policies across five provinces in northern China. Four scenarios – Current Policy (CP), Announced Policy (AP), Enhanced Policy (EP), and Net-Zero Emissions (NZE) – are developed and assessed using a dedicated hydrogen planning model, MESSAGEix-H2NC. With cumulative demand of end-use applications expanding 1.3 times compared to CP, the AP scenario's absence of carbon emission constraints leads to a reliance on non-clean hydrogen, resulting in higher carbon emissions than CP. Cost reductions under EP achieve lower emission intensity (11.9 kgCO2/kgH2 by 2030 and 3.6 kgCO2/kgH2 by 2060). Consequently, the investment gap for EP grows from $2.4 billion in 2025 to $89.7 billion in 2060, while the gap for more thorough net-zero emissions (NZE) expands from $10 billion in 2025 to $107 billion in 2060. The investment gap between EP and NZE relative to CP expands over time. Overall, the model results highlight potential deficiencies in current hydrogen development plans and incentive policies in northern China. These findings reveal a misalignment between current policies and CO2 reduction targets and underscore the need for accelerated technological advancements to improve cost competitiveness.

The aviation sector has a significant role to play in the reduction of carbon emissions, particularly in light of EU emissions targets. Within the EU, aviation emissions constitute 13.9 per cent of total transport emissions, where under the Green Deal a target of 90 per cent reduction in transport emissions by 2050 has been set. Several tax exemptions apply to the aviation sector due to its international nature, which have contributed to an increasing trend in emissions. Recent movements in EU policy under the ‘Fit for 55’ package, as well as public and political interest, have focused attention on changing the taxation struc-ture of the aviation industry in order to reduce CO2 emissions. This report focuses on several different potential policies and taxation structures which would attempt to decrease the emissions of the aviation sector: the removal of kerosene taxation exemption (in line with the recent EU proposal), removal of VAT exemption, introduction of a passenger tax, and abolition of free EU ETS allowances by 2026 (in line with the recent EU proposal). Each of these policies, as well a combination scenario, is assessed with respect to the impacts on the aviation industry, spillover effects, macro-economic and government revenue effects, and household effects, as well as the emissions impacts. This analysis applies the Ireland, Environment, Energy and Economy (I3E) model, which allows for the examination of spillover effects of the aviation industry to government, households and other industries. This methodology does not, however, allow for a detailed analysis of different passenger or airline types. In what follows, results are shown as cumulative percentage changes compared to no aviation taxation. Hence a decrease does not present an annual decrease but the build up of a cumulative decrease from 2022 to the given year.

CO₂ emissions are one form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to global warming. CO₂ contributed 175.62 million tons in 2021, impacting greenhouse gas levels. One strategy to reduce the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere is to convert CO₂ gas into useful chemicals. One example of this is the hydrogenation of CO₂ to produce methane, which can serve as an alternative to LPG. The aim of this research is to produce methane gas by developing a fixed bed reactor in a simple manner. The catalyst Ni/Al2O3 with 20 grams and five regenerations could produce CH₄ up to 49.73% compared to 39.06% for those with 10 grams. However, the H2 gas remaining is higher for those with 10 grams (1.454 ppm compared to 1.042 ppm). Also, The CO2 gas remaining is higher for those with 10 grams (58.18% compared to 47.92%). The results of this study can be the basis for developing energy policies, encouraging investment in clean energy technologies, and supporting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for energy sustainability and resilience.

The removal of barriers to the movement of goods, services and factors of production within an integration association leads to the emergence of spillover effects that have a significant impact on the welfare of the population in the integrating countries. Given the growing dynamics of trade turnover and accelerating economic growth in the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), as well as the lack of studies on the environmental situation in this region, the study of the impact of technology on the environment in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia is of particular relevance. The purpose of the study is to identify the impact of technological spillover on the state of the environment in five EAEU countries in the interval 2011-2022. Hypothesis of the study - the spread of technology in the EAEU space changes the quality of production (there is an increase in the share of renewable energy sources), and this reduces damage to the environment, through the reduction of CO2 emissions. The study investigated the stationarity of variables, determined the most appropriate model for each set of data, considered the possibility of using models with fixed or random effects. As a result of the study, the hypothesis stated in the paper was not confirmed by panel data for the EAEU countries in the interval 2011-2022.

Background/Objective: The relationship between food consumption and environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly evident. The aim of this study was to estimate the evolution of the environmental impact of food consumption in the Spanish population, assessed in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Methods: Data collected from the Household Budget Survey were included, from approximately 24,000 households for the period of 2006–2023. The environmental impact of diet, in terms of GHG emissions, was estimated from the EAT-Lancet Commission tables, and the adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) was calculated using the Dietary Score index. Results: The environmental impact of the Spanish diet, in terms of GHG, followed a downward trend over the years analysed, from 3978.1 g CO2-eq in 2006 to 3281.4 g CO2-eq in 2023, a decrease of 17.5%. The food groups with the largest decrease in consumption during this period were red meat (from 39.9 kg/year to 35.5 kg/year), fish (from 24.3 kg/year to 19.0 kg/year), and dairy products (from 113.4 kg/year to 99.7 kg/year). The level of adherence to the MedDiet increased slightly from 34 points in 2006 to 35 points in 2023 due to an increase in the amount of vegetables (42.7 kg/year vs. 44.3 kg/year) and grains consumed (53.1 kg/year vs. 72.6 kg/year) and a decrease in fish consumption (24.3 kg/year vs. 19.0 kg/year). Conclusions: In Spain, a reduction in GHG emissions associated with food consumption was observed due to a decrease in the consumption of red meat, fish, dairy products, and fats. National surveys are very useful tools to analyse the impact of food consumption on climate change and to assess the effect of the policies implemented to contain it.

The competences of the President of the Energy Regulatory Office include, inter alia, resolving disputes between parties of specific contractual relations in which at least one party is an energy enterprise. One of the categories of such disputes is refusal to connect a renewable energy installation. The analysis presented in this paper leads to a conclusion that due to the multidimensional goals laid down in energy law, technical and economic conditions should be examined while taking into account interests of all stakeholders. This article presents analyses the law in force, involving a case study of a Polish example and a comparative analysis. As a result, the author has come to the conclusion that resolving disputes by the President is a legal instrument that serves to ensure equal treatment and connection of market participants who request it, at the same time facilitating reduction of CO2 emissions and energy neutrality pursuant to the principles adopted by the European Union and the international community. The article draws on selected acts of ordinary law, the relevant literature, decisions made by courts and tribunals, as well as data published by the President and by industry entities.

This study evaluates the performance of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (codh) embedded strains in bench-scale microbial electrochemical systems (MES) for CO₂ reduction to biofuels and biochemicals. CO2 fermentation efficiency was evaluated by comparing the wild-type Clostridium acetobutylicum (Wild), a negative control E. coli strain lacking the codh gene (NC-BL21), and engineered E. coli strain (Eng) alone and with IPTG induction (Eng+IPTG). Four electrochemical systems were used viz. Wild+E, NC-BL21+E, Eng+E, and Eng+IPTG+E, with a poised potential of 0.6 V applied to the working electrode. CO₂ and bicarbonate were supplemented to a total inorganic carbon (IC) concentration of 40 g/L, with a retention time of 60 h. The engineered strains demonstrated enhanced metabolic performance compared to the wild-type and negative control strains, yielding a maximum formic acid concentration of 2.1 g/L and acetic acid concentration of 7.8 g/L under the Eng+IPTG condition. Ethanol yield was highest at 3.9 g/L under the Eng+IPTG+E condition, substantially exceeding the 2.4 g/L acetic acid yield observed in the wild-type strain. The engineered strains showed superior cumulative yields (0.4075 g/g), improved codh charge flux stability (60 vs. 5 for Wild), and upregulated expression of genes in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Bioelectrochemical performance analysis demonstrated elevated reductive catalytic currents, enhanced CO₂ reduction, and optimal charge transfer kinetics. This study highlights the effectiveness of genetic and process engineering, particularly codh overexpression and IPTG induction, in optimizing microbial electrosynthesis for biofuel and biochemical production from C1 gases.

The iron and steel industry is a sector with very high energy consumption and also causing high emissions. It is difficult to imagine the development of modern sectors of the economy such as construction, transport or the machinery industry without the use of steel, so forecasts indicate that the demand for steel will increase in the future. Meanwhile, environmental concerns and concerns about climate change are growing, so the iron and steel industry faces a serious challenge related to reducing its emissions in order to achieve the goal set in the Paris Agreement, and this is even more true for this industry in the European Union. Currently, the most popular technology for steel production is the blast furnace process – basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF). This technology requires the use of coal, which is a source of emissions, so a radical technological change is needed. Decarbonising the steel industry requires changing from coal-based metallurgy to hydrogen-based and electricity-based metallurgy. Changing from primary to secondary steel production (using scrap steel) improves the situation but is not a solution to meet growing demand. There are two main technology paths that can achieve significant CO2 reduction. The first is Smart Carbon Usage (SCU), which is based on the gradual reduction of coal consumption, including the use of by-product gases for further conversion into valuable products. The second emerging technology path is Carbon Direct Avoidance (CDA). These and other developing methods of low-emission or zero-emission metallurgy are discussed in the article. Unfortunately, some of these methods are not mature and their final commercialisation requires overcoming a number of problems.

Carbon black is one of the most ubiquitous reinforcing fine particles in use today for tyres and rubber goods, providing significantly enhanced performance, strength and lifetime. Without carbon black, tyres would have to be replaced at a significantly higher rate, and thus carbon black has proven to be one of the first, original sustainable materials providing a significant social contribution towards sustainable mobility and the benefits this concept brings to civilization. Additionally, carbon black is used for many specialty applications in plastics, inks, and coatings where its benefits as a colourant, conductive agent and UV-resistive material are realised, again providing higher performance and longer lasting materials with significant social benefit. In this chapter, the manufacturing processes for the various commercial carbon blacks produced today are reviewed, along with the fundamental properties of carbon black that play a key role in its performance in its numerous applications. Also discussed is the future of carbon black and the latest recycled and renewable materials that may compliment carbon black in the future, obviously with an eye toward future reductions in CO2 and the concept of sustainable carbon blacks.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties, but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active-learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results experimentally. To illustrate their catalytic implications, we examined the behavior of Rh single atoms on the reconstructed surfaces, focusing on CO2 activation, the rate-limiting step in the RWGS reaction. Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.

Abstract Due to multiple external shocks since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the world economy, SSA is facing acute debt distress and new highs in the cost of foreign capital at exactly the time it needs to mobilise a stepwise level of financing to invest in human, physical and natural capital to meet the region's development and climate goals for the 21st Century. This paper outlines the relative levels of sovereign external debt and service payments between now and 2030 for SSA countries. We calculate the fiscal space level left to meet climate and development financing needs during the same period. The region cannot meet those pressing needs without new forms of liquidity, concessional and grant finance to complement and bend down the cost of capital and comprehensive debt relief. We find that External debt in SSA has more than tripled since 2008, experiencing the largest increase in debt and the largest increase in debt-to fiscal revenue in the developing world—as capital costs have hit new highs.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and private bondholders represent 60% of the region's external debt, with roughly equal shares of 30%. China and the Paris Club are owed 12 and 5%.Sub-Saharan's external debt service is the equivalent to 93% of the average country's climate financing needs, and only ten countries in the region have the borrowing space to finance those needs.The region urgently needs new forms of liquidity, concessional and grant-based development finance that catalyses low-cost private finance; and for those countries in debt distress significant debt relief across all creditor classes that is aligned with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.MDBs will need to provide between $2.4 and $34.5 billion in relief in a manner that does not harm their preferred creditor status or crediting ratings, or the burden of reduction by the private sector and official creditors will be immense. Sub-Saharan Africa's debt distress is in large part a function of external shocks of which the region had no control—such as COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, climate shocks, the globalisation of inflation from advanced economies and advanced economy interest rate hikes. Moreover, the region is responsible for roughly one half of 1% of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and bares the highest level of the costs of climate change itself (IMF, 2017; Moss, 2020). Given the lack of voice and representation that the region has in the international economic architecture, advanced economies must lead. Further inaction will not only inflict material damage globally in the form of climate change and lost market opportunities, but also further erode the legitimacy of the architecture itself.

This study investigates the distributional impacts of carbon taxes, traditionally examined through simulation studies on the regressivity of hypothetical tax scenarios. However, the dy-namic influence of actually implemented carbon taxes on consumption/income poverty and inequality in a cross-country setting has been less scrutinised. This paper assesses the effect of carbon taxes introduced in the past three decades in 15 European countries on consumption shares of the lowest decile groups, poverty rates and inequality indices. The analysis shows that a $40/ton CO2 tax covering 30% of emissions leads to a consumption share increase of up to 4% for the bottom 20% and 40% of the population, a trend that persisted for five years post implementation, particularly in nations that efficiently redistribute carbon tax revenues. This resulted in a modest reduction in consumption inequality over three years. In contrast, the impact of carbon taxes on income poverty and inequality is not statistically significant. These findings suggest that concerns about poverty and inequality due to carbon taxes can be miti-gated by implementing a moderate tax combined with a strategically efficient revenue redis-tribution mechanism.

β-cyclocitric acid and its precursor β-cyclocitral are signaling apocarotenoids which trigger defense and detoxification mechanisms enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. From a transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis plants exposed to each apocarotenoid over several exposure times, we identified a gene (CYP81D11) encoding a cytochrome P450 that is strongly induced under all conditions and is under the control of the TGAII-SCL14 transcription regulator. Overexpressing the CYP81D11 gene in Arabidopsis led to a very tolerant phenotype to high light stress while a CYP81D11-deficient mutant was photosensitive. The transcriptomic profile of the CYP81D11 overexpressor revealed a selective upregulation of genes related to photosynthesis and the response to high light stress. Photosynthetic electron transport, CO2 fixation and biomass production were noticeably improved by high expression levels of CYP81D11. These effects occurred in high light, not in low light, and were associated with a noticeable reduction of singlet oxygen photoproduction. These findings indicate that CYP81D11 is a key component of β-cyclocitral-induced stress tolerance, acting through enhancement of the photosynthetic capacity of leaves. This gene could be a new target for improving photosynthesis, particularly in sunny environments.

The electrification of transport is increasingly recognized as a pivotal strategy in global efforts to mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and decrease dependency on fossil fuels. This paper investigates the key drivers behind the shift toward electric transportation, emphasizing environmental benefits, energy security, and technological advancements. Notable environmental advantages include significant reductions in CO2 emissions and air pollution, while energy security is enhanced by diminished reliance on oil and improved integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with renewable energy sources. Technological progress in battery systems, electric drivetrains, and smart grid infrastructure has accelerated the feasibility of widespread EV adoption. Despite these advances, the transition to electric transport faces several challenges, including the need for extensive charging infrastructure, sustainable sourcing of critical materials like lithium and cobalt, and the economic impacts on industries and labor markets. The paper explores strategies to overcome these challenges, such as advancements in recycling technologies, enhanced grid management, and supportive economic policies. By analyzing both the drivers and barriers, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape and future prospects for sustainable transport electrification.

Various electrocatalysts have undergone extensive examination regarding their capacity to selectively produce desired products via the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Nonetheless, the efficiency of a CO2RR electrocatalyst does not guarantee the effectiveness of a co-catalyst on the semiconductor surface for photoelectrochemical CO2RR. Herein, we synthesize Bi2S3 nanorods and electrochemically reduce them to Bi nanoplates that adhere to substrates for use in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical CO2RR applications. Compared with bare Bi, the Bi 2 S 3 -derived Bi (S-Bi) nanoplates on carbon paper exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for formate (HCOO - ) in the electrochemical CO 2 RR, achieving a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 93%, with minimal H 2 production over a wide potential range. This highly selective S-Bi catalyst is being employed on the Si photocathode to investigate the behavior of electrocatalysts during photoelectrochemical CO 2 RR. The strong adhesion of the S-Bi nanoplates to the Si nanowire substrate and their unique catalytic properties afford exceptional activity and selectivity for HCOO - under simulated solar irradiation. The selectivity observed in electrochemical CO 2 RR using the S-Bi catalyst correlates with that seen in the photoelectrochemical CO 2 RR system. Combined pulsed potential methods and theoretical analyses reveal stabilization of the OCHO* intermediate on the S-Bi catalyst under specific conditions, which is critical for developing efficient catalysts for CO 2 -to-HCOO - conversion. These results emphasize the potential of S-Bi as an effective catalyst for CO 2 reduction reactions and provide valuable insights into optimizing the reaction mechanisms and enhancing the product selectivity, especially in conjunction with co-catalysts for Si photocathodes.

Chemical weed control is a significant agricultural concern, and reliance on a limited range of herbicide action modes has increased resistant weed species, many of which use C4 metabolism. As a result, the identification of novel herbicidal agents with low toxicity targeting C4 plants becomes imperative. An assessment was conducted on the impact of 3-cyanobenzoic acid on the growth and photosynthetic processes of maize (Zea mays), a representative C4 plant, cultivated hydroponically over 14 days. The results showed a significant reduction in plant growth and notable disruptions in gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence due to the application of 3-cyanobenzoic acid, indicating compromised photosynthetic activity. Parameters such as the chlorophyll index, net assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), maximum effective photochemical efficiency (Fv′/Fm′), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (ϕPSII), and electron transport rate through PSII (ETR) all decreased. The A/PAR curve revealed reductions in the maximum net assimilation rate (Amax) and apparent quantum yield (ϕ), alongside an increased light compensation point (LCP). Moreover, 3-cyanobenzoic acid significantly decreased the carboxylation rates of RuBisCo (Vcmax) and PEPCase (Vpmax), electron transport rate (J), and mesophilic conductance (gm). Overall, 3-cyanobenzoic acid induced substantial changes in plant growth, carboxylative processes, and photochemical activities. The treated plants also exhibited heightened susceptibility to intense light conditions, indicating a significant and potentially adverse impact on their physiological functions. These findings suggest that 3-cyanobenzoic acid or its analogs could be promising for future research targeting photosynthesis.

This study examines calcium extraction from Bottom Ash (BA) and the use of Solid Residue (SR) as a substitute for White Lump Clay (WLC) in brick production. Experimental analyses identified calcium and silicon as the main elements in BA, with 50% of calcium carbonate recovered through leaching. SR was a viable alternative to WLC in ceramic bricks, as SEM-EDS and FTIR analyses revealed changes in composition and microstructure. This approach promotes circular economy principles by recovering resources and reducing waste. Calcium extraction from BA can produce 29,000 tons of CaCO3 annually for industrial use, while substituting SR for WLC in brick production could replace 30% of clay, saving 1500 tons of clay and producing millions of bricks annually. Less than 50% of incinerated Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) would require landfilling. The process supports sustainable construction by conserving natural resources, reducing landfill waste, and lowering CO2 emissions. It offers annual cost savings of 2,639,250 USD and preserves 74,812.5 tons of resources through waste and clay reduction. By demonstrating a scalable model for waste valorization, this research aligns with global goals for sustainable development, resource efficiency, and ecological balance.

Background: The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is a measure of quantitative anesthetic potency and has become the standard index for the evaluation and comparison of volatile anesthetics, in addition to guiding dose administration. Black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) are primates present in the clinical and surgical routine of veterinary hospitals, as well as experimental models, especially in neuroscience. Few studies have evaluated the potency of the main volatile anesthetics in this species. This study aimed to determine the MAC of isoflurane and sevoflurane in C. penicillata using the up-and-down method and to evaluate the effects of these drugs on the quality of anesthetic induction, maintenance, and recovery. Materials, Methods & Results: Twenty-four animals of undetermined age were used. All marmosets were healthy according to hematological and physical evaluation. The animals were randomly divided into two groups: ISOMAC and SEVOMAC. Each animal was induced to general anesthesia in an anesthetic box with oxygen (5 L/min) and sevoflurane at 7% in the SEVOMAC group or isoflurane at 5% in the ISOMAC. Upon reaching lateral decubitus, orotracheal intubation was performed. General anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane or sevoflurane diluted in oxygen (0.8 L/min) using a non-rebreathing delivery system under spontaneous ventilation. As defined in the pilot study, the first animal from ISOMAC started the maintenance of anesthesia with 2.6% isoflurane, while the first animal in SEVOMAC received 4% sevoflurane. After finishing the instrumentation to assess heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, and rectal temperature, a 15-minute wait to reach anesthetic equilibrium was allowed, and then an electrical noxious stimulation (50 mA and 50 Hz) was performed on the lateral aspect of the thigh (a faradic current of 3 consecutive single stimuli, followed by 2 continuous stimuli). The animals' responses to the electrical stimulus were observed. The presence of a positive response (gross movement of the limbs, head, or vocalization) or a negative response (absence of gross movements) determined the increase or reduction, respectively, of the inhalation anesthetic concentration by 10% in the subsequent marmoset. The quality of anesthetic induction and recovery from anesthesia was evaluated using a scale that measured the intensity of agitation, coughing, nausea, and vomiting. Physiological variables were recorded before (M0) and after (M1) applying the nociceptive stimulus. Isoflurane and sevoflurane MAC values in C. penicillata were 2.29 ± 0.10% and 3.93 ± 0.61% respectively. Physiological parameters, quality of anesthetic induction and recovery did not differ significantly between groups. However, isoflurane caused irritation of the airway and ocular mucous membranes, more coughing episodes, and tearing at induction. There was no difference between groups for time to extubation and recovery time to regain sternal position. Discussion: Previous studies in primates found lower MAC values for both anesthetics, except for Lemur catta. Those findings may be explained by the use of different nociceptive stimuli and the MAC determination method employed, although no differences in MAC values have been described between bracketing or up-and-down methods in human primates and dogs. It is unlikely that the stimulus and technique alone are the determining factors for the high concentration of isoflurane and sevoflurane observed in the present study since MAC was high with both halogenates, indicating that dose extrapolation from other species can lead to the wrong anesthetic dosage.

Biochar’s benign effects on agricultural production have been demonstrated. Still, no consistent conclusions have been drawn on the impact of biochar-amended paddy fields on carbon sequestration, gas emission reduction, and efficiency enhancement in typical cropping areas in the middle Yangtze River. A field experiment using five dosages of biochar (CK, BC1.5, BC3, BC4.5, and BC6) at 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 kg·m−2 was conducted at the Hubei Irrigation Experiment Center Station, Jingmen City, Hubei Province, China, to investigate the effects of biochar on carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, and agricultural efficiency in paddy in the middle Yangtze River Region. This study showed that the optimal biochar dosage was 4.5 kg·m−2 (BC4.5). Biochar significantly improved soil properties, increased rice yield by 26.4–61.4%, and enhanced water use efficiency (WUE) and economic profit (EP) by 32.0–83.7% and −8.0–48.6%, respectively. Biochar increased soil carbon sequestration (SCS) and carbon pool management index (CPMI) by 23.0–198.3% and 22.9–71.5%, respectively. Biochar also reduced greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI), global warming potential (GWP), and emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that soil organic carbon (SOC), in addition to the “biochar” influence factor, was a key positive influence factor for SCS, CPMI, and EP. Another major positive factor for GWP was silt, and for WUE it was saturated hydraulic conductivity, while TN and SOC were the major negative variables for GHGI. In summary, biochar demonstrated outstanding carbon sequestration and emission reduction impacts while ensuring crop production growth and efficiency improvement. The results provide a research basis for safeguarding food security and mitigating climate warming in the middle Yangtze River region.

Renewable raw materials, as regenerative biobased feedstock for chemicals, have an enormous potential for reducing feedstock-related greenhouse gas emissions. Dedicated to driving the growth of bioeconomy, we continuously explore and develop building blocks for turning the bioeconomy ambition into a reality. Bio-based products are already available in the market but are limited in growth due to lack of technologies and product development costs. Alternatively, scale-up and utilization of biobased feedstocks, leveraging existing infrastructure, requires utilization of different chain-of-custody models. That is how a growing need for bio-attributed products, which provide the same quality and performance of their conventional equivalent and a proven benefit determined by the reduction of the Product Carbon Footprint in cradle-to-gate assessments, can be fulfilled. Ranging from a discussion around collaboration to drive sustainability in the chemical industry, towards current and future policy asks, we discuss about the opportunities of using different types of feedstocks and how we can accelerate industry transformation strategies by using attribution models, model biogenic CO2-uptake in a meaningful, fair, and transparent way, based on accepted and harmonized standards, such as global ISO standards. We provide reference points and statistics and address the latest and the most important bioeconomy-related aspects of bio-attribution as science is evolving.

Cities encounter increasing risks and challenges under new development patterns, and digital economy (DE) can drive cities’ improved resilience to natural and social uncertainties. Based on data collected on the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2011 to 2021, the development situation of the regional DE and urban resilience (UR) was measured, and the impact mechanisms of the DE on UR were analysed theoretically and empirically using a benchmark regression model. The findings are as follows: The benchmark test revealed that the DE development contributed significantly to UR in the region. The mediating effect test revealed that the DE improved UR through two pathways: industrial structure upgradation and energy restructuring. The moderating effect test suggested that environmental pollutant emissions had a negative moderating effect between the impact mechanisms of the DE, industrial structure, and energy structure and between the effects of industrial structure, energy structure, and UR, whereas CO2 emissions had a positive moderating effect between the impact mechanisms of DE and industrial structure. Heterogeneity analysis indicated that the DE contributed positively to the UR except in the upstream region, where the coefficient of the DE was insignificant. Overall, this study highlights the crucial role of the DE in improving UR and elucidates the theoretical impact mechanisms of environmental pollution control and carbon reduction measures on UR.

Artificial N2 fixation via the electrocatalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) has been recently promoted as a rational route toward reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission as compared with the traditional Haber–Bosch process. Nevertheless, optimizing NRR relies on developing highly efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we report on the reliable and reproducible synthesis of two promising electrocatalysts in either the presence or absence of Ketjenblack (KB), namely, ZrO2–ZrN@KB and ZrO2–ZrN systems, synthesized through the nitriding of Zr. Both materials had never previously been considered for NRR, to the best of our knowledge. Nevertheless, both of these electrocatalysts incorporated a combination of tetragonal ZrO2, ZrON, and cubic ZrN and showed excellent activity and durability toward NH3 formation. Moreover, the maximum NH3 production rate of 84.1 μg h–1 mg–1 at −0.7 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was achieved with the ZrO2–ZrN electrocatalyst with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 21.2% at −0.6 V vs RHE, indicating a high selectivity associated with the NRR. Additionally, the catalysts demonstrated excellent stability during the electrolysis process and recycling tests. We postulate that the combination of exposed active sites of ZrN and ZrO2 likely contributes to the enhanced NRR performance attributed to ZrO2–ZrN.

The phosphate-bearing rocks (phosphate rocks and phosphorites) were studied over a 45-meter interval of the Moyero river section, covering the upper part of the Darriwilian and the lower part of the Sandbian stages of the Ordovician. These rocks were investigated by field observations and laboratory methods, including optic and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analyses. The accumulation of phosphatic matter is manifested in carbonates, sandstones, and aleurolites in the form of grains (ooids and peloids), intraclasts, phosphatic and phosphatized shells. In argillites, it is represented by cryptocrystalline matter. Phosphate matter consists of fluorapatite. The peaks of phosphate accumulation are associated with the formation of layers of physically reworked granular phosphorites (condensation horizons) directly above the depositional sequence boundaries. The formation of the studied phosphate-bearing rocks during the Darriwilian-Sandbian transition was influenced by a combination of global (Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), reduction in sea surface temperature, atmospheric CO2, high sea level, flooding of craton margins) and regional (equatorial position of Siberia, arid climate, facies) factors. Global conditions led to the enrichment of seawater with phosphorus and the effect of upwelling. Regional conditions determined the characteristics of phosphate formation. Studied phosphate-bearing rocks can be considered as a record of upwelling on the Siberian craton during the Middle-Late Ordovician transition and one of the manifestations of long-term global cooling started early in the Middle Ordovician.

Photoelectrochemistry holds the promise of directly converting sunlight to valuable chemical products since its birth over 50 years ago. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods, however, lag behind their electrochemical (EC) counterparts (which can be powered by a solar photovoltaic (PV) power source) in terms of current density, by orders of magnitude. In this work, we demonstrate that by integrating the recent achievements of the PV and EC communities (in terms of using concentrated sunlight and gas diffusion electrodes, respectively), we can achieve current densities similar to EC methods, but with lower energy input. Specifically, in this proof-of-concept study, we combined the direct PEC oxidation of glycerol (on a NiOOH co-catalyst-coated n-Si photoanode) with the dark hydrogen evolution (HER) or CO2 reduction (CO2R) in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) separated continuous-flow PEC cell. We achieved over 110 mA cm–2 photocurrent density under 10 Sun irradiation, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than those typically reported in the literature, for any of these PEC half reactions. We demonstrated that the product distribution of glycerol oxidation is notably different in PEC and EC scenarios at the same current density, and the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be suppressed in the PEC case. This approach raises new opportunities to drive electrochemical reactions with complex reaction pathways in a more selective manner even at high current densities. In the second part of my talk I will demonstrate the effect of the co-catalyst properties in tailoring the product distribution.

"The preservation of meat has always presented a complex problem to man. The first means of preservation was probably rubbing salt onto the meat surface. This dried out the surface enough and produced a high enough salt concentration to inhibit the growth of spoilage organisms. It is believed that the salt used at first contained many impurities such as salt peter (sodium nitrate), which were also inhibitory to spoilage organisms. The meat would last longer than fresh unprotected meat, but the high salt concentration produced a rather unpalatable finished product. New means of preservation were provided with an increase in technology. A new method of preservation was developed by Nicholas Appert in the late 1700's. He found that foods heated in sealed containers lasted longer than foods that were unprotected as long as the container was not opened. This finding developed into the canning industry. Refrigeration was the most important technological advancement in meat preservation since canning. The reduction in temperature down to 0-5 [degrees] C decreased the rate of growth of spoilage organisms. Refrigeration greatly expanded the length of time meat could be stored. Meat could be transported further with increased shelf-life and storage time at home was increased. With the advent of refrigeration in the retail store, meat could be individually packaged and self-service meat cases evolved. The retail shelf-life was still limited to several days because the meat packaging material was oxygen permeable and provided an environment for bacterial growth. New types of packaging systems have been introduced that replace or remove oxygen and thus inhibit spoilage bacterial growth. Different gasses have been used to replace oxyqen to extend the storage life of meat. Carbon dioxide has been used successfully to replace oxygen and has caused significant increases in storage time (Baran et al., 1970; Huffman, 1974). Huffman, (1974) also reported using nitrogen to replace oxygen, but found no decrease in bacterial counts. In addition, Pierson et al., 1970, reported finding no difference between vacuum packaging and nitrogen gas packaging. Vacuum packaging excludes oxygen from the meat package thereby inhibiting aerobic spoilage organisms. Oxygen impermeable films have been developed to facilitate vacuum packaging. The use of vacuum packaging has become very popular in the distribution of beef wholesale cuts. Vacuum packaging of pork has not been utilized much in industry to date. Very little is known about the effects of vacuum packaging on pork. The objectives of this research were to determine: 1. The impact of (a) chill method and storage temperature and (b) meat quality on weight losses, tenderness, and oxygen saturation of the purge in vacuum packaged fresh boneless pork sirloin roasts. 2. The impact of leakers on (a) the subsequent microbial profile population and (b) fresh meat color after three days of retail display of vacuum packaged fresh boneless pork sirloin roasts."--Introduction.

The article presents the results of research on the impact of material and construction solutions on energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Field research was conducted in an existing free-standing greenhouse located in southern Poland. The research period covered the entire calendar year. The measurement data were used in the next step to validate the computational model using the numerical method of elementary balances. The data distribution was also analyzed in terms of basic statistics. The validated and verified model was used in the further part of the analysis to conduct computer simulations for three variants, differing in terms of material and construction solutions. The variants included: no foundation insulation, extruded polystyrene (XPS) insulation and the use of single-chamber polycarbonate panels with thermal insulation of the foundations. The obtained results showed a high agreement between theoretical and real data (85–89% for the coefficient of determination (R2) and 84–88% for the GOF method). In the case of variant 1, which in terms of material and construction solutions corresponded to the actual construction of the greenhouse, it was found that the annual energy demand for heating purposes amounted to 153,234 kWh/year. In variant 2, in which additional thermal insulation relative to the zero state was used, the energy demand for heating purposes was lower and amounted to 147,704 kWh/year. The lowest heat load was characteristic of variant 3, in which 116,294 kWh/year was required to cover heating needs. The variant with polycarbonate and foundation insulation brought energy savings of 24% and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 24%. In addition, replacing fuel from hard coal with natural gas brought significant benefits, reducing pollutant emissions by 51%. The paper is a new approach to the use of the mentioned numerical method for the assessment of gaseous pollutant emissions in this type of building based on numerical simulations of energy consumption.

A fuel cell is a generator that produces electric power by the hydrogen oxidation reaction at a fuel electrode and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at an air electrode. A fuel cell is a clean energy conversion system that produces only water without emission of carbon dioxide. However, Pt (an expensive precious metal) is used as a catalyst of a fuel cell. Reduction of Pt loading in the catalyst or development of alternative materials of Pt is important for the widespread of fuel cells as a primary energy source in the future. Finding out materials that have higher ORR activity is a major target of the development of fuel cells. TiO 2 , a more abundant resource compared to Pt, is one of the alternative materials of Pt. The ORR activity of TiO 2 can be enhanced by metal doping [1]. Theoretical calculation predicts that doping of Pd and Rh reduces the overpotential of the ORR to zero [2]. The ORR activity of Nb doped TiO 2 electrodes depends on the crystal orientation as follows: TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (111) < TiO 2 (110) [3]. However, the real surface structure and adsorbed species for enhancing the ORR activity have not been determined on TiO 2 single crystal electrodes in electrochemical environments. In this study, we have studied the adsorbates on the low index planes of TiO 2 single crystals in 0.1 M HClO 4 using nanoparticle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (NPSERS). We assigned adsorbed species using DFT calculation. 1%Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (100), TiO 2 (110) and TiO 2 (111) were annealed and chemically polished with a 30w% HF solution. Au nanoparticles of about 50 nm were dispersed on the single crystal surfaces. Raman spectra were measured by stepping the potential positively with the interval of 0.1 V. The electrolyte solution was 0.1 M HClO 4 . All the potentials were referred to RHE. NPSERS bands were found at 580 cm -1 and 360 cm -1 in Ar saturated HClO 4 . The onset potentials of the bands were 0.4, 0.6, and 0.7 V(RHE) on TiO 2 (100), TiO 2 (110) and TiO 2 (111), respectively. The Au-O stretching vibration of Au nanoparticles appears from 1.4 V(RHE) at 590 cm -1 [4]. Thus the observed bands originate from surface adsorbates of TiO 2 . The band at 580 cm -1 was shifted 15 cm -1 to lower frequency in D 2 O solution, showing that the band is an adsorbed species containing hydrogen. On the other hand, the band at 360 cm -1 is an oxygen species such as Ti-O because no deuterium isotope effect was observed in D 2 O solution. DFT calculation showed that symmetrical stretching vibrations of Ti-OH-Ti (bridged OH) and Ti-OD-Ti locate at 577 and 564 cm -1 , respectively. Ti-O-H out-of-plane bending vibration and in-plane bending vibration also locate at 350 cm -1 and 680 cm -1 , respectively, which are close to the above-mentioned 577 cm -1 according to the DFT calculation using the bridged OH model. However, these two vibrations shift more than 100 cm -1 by the substitution with deuterium, which contradicts the experimental result. Other candidates of the adsorbed species containing hydrogen are OH and OOH on 5-coordinated titanium. However, TiO 2 (100), which has no 5-coordinated titanium, also gave the NPSERS band at 580 cm -1 . Therefore, the band at 580 cm -1 is assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of Ti-OH-Ti (bridged OH). The onset potential of 580 cm -1 band increases as TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (110) ≤ TiO 2 (111), whereas the order of the ORR activity is TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (111) < TiO 2 (110). No correlation is found between the onset potential and the ORR activity. This result suggests that adsorbed water, which cannot be observed with NPSERS, is involved in the ORR activity.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">The aim of this study is to compare possible approaches that support the goal of achieving a carbon-neutral society in the mobility sector, with a specific focus on the two-wheel segment of the mobility sector. One of the key considerations in the mobility sector is the transition from a fossil fuel-based energy mix to a more renewable one. While there are numerous options available for achieving a carbon-neutral society in the four-wheel scenario, the two-wheel sector presents a different challenge due to a smaller number of available options. This study introduces a new comparison between full electric, gasoline, and ethanol-powered two-wheeled vehicles. It suggests that ethanol is a feasible solution for reducing carbon emissions in the two-wheel sector. The study includes an analysis of CO2 emissions for two-wheel vehicles using a life cycle approach, focusing on the technologies of full electric motorcycles, motorcycles with flex-fuel internal combustion engines running on gasoline, and motorcycles with flex-fuel internal combustion engines running on ethanol. The energy mix of a country, which serves as a reference for this study, directly impacts emissions from the mobility sector. Therefore, the analysis focuses on Brazil, China, and India, which represent significant markets in the two-wheel segment and are crucial for decarbonization efforts. The findings of the analysis indicate that motorcycles powered by ethanol can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 56% compared to gasoline-powered motorcycles and by 52%, 48%, and 37% compared to electric motorcycles in countries with emission-intensive energy sources such as China, India, and the United States, respectively. However, in countries with more renewable electricity sources, such as Brazil and France, full electric motorcycles showed slight advantages. The study also suggests that, based on the Brazilian experience with flex-fuel two-wheeled vehicles, replacing 60% of the current gasoline-powered fleet with ethanol-powered vehicles could lead to a reduction of around 34% of all emissions associated with the two-wheeler sector in China and India. The conclusions drawn from this study provide valuable insights for comparative discussions on the decarbonization of the two- and four-wheel segments. These insights can be instrumental in making strategic decisions and promoting the development of alternative sectoral solutions.</div></div>

Greenhouse gas emissions and following global climate change problems are the most important human-being facing issues. The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is one of the most promising processes to obtain value-added hydrocarbons from carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O), and the process is being actively investigated as an alternative way to conventional hydrocarbon production by fossil resources. Among the electrocatalysts for CO 2 RR, copper (Cu) species are unique and most studied material group because of their capability of producing C 2+ species, such as ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) and propanol, through forming C-C bonding. Especially C 2 H 4 is the most highly demanded and profitable product [1] . Porous structure of electrodes is reported to be advantageous to CO 2 RR because it enables enrichment of reactants, CO 2 molecules, and intermediates [2–5] . Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a hydrophobic polymer, has been reported to be beneficial to increase the FE towards C 2+ products [6] and suppressing competitive reaction, hydrogen production [7,8] . In this study, we prepared PTFE modified porous Cu electrodes and investigated the influence of each factor and their synergistic effect on CO 2 RR activity. As a result, the introduction of porous structure increased FE to C 2 H 4 (FE(C 2 H 4 )) and suppressed both carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) production. Further modification by PTFE enhanced FE(C 2 H 4 ) and improved durability significantly. Porous Cu electrode was prepared by de-alloying process [9] . First, Cu and Al metals were co-sputtered to form CuAl alloy on gas-diffusion layer (GDL, MFK-A, Mitsubishi Chemical) coated with micro porous layer (MPL). The samples were etched using 5 wt.% hydrochloric acid for approximately 20 minutes to remove Al from the alloy and obtained porous Cu electrodes. CO 2 RR test was carried out in flow cell with gas-diffusion electrode (GDE), the electrocatalyst coated GDL, as a cathode under applied current density of 300 mA cm -2 . Both gas phase products and liquidous products were quantified by gas chromatography (GC). Structural characterizations using scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed that porous Cu structure was successfully formed, and porous Cu electrodes exhibited higher FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 48%, and lower FE toward CO (FE(CO)) of 6% and FE toward CH 4 (FE(CH 4 )) of less than detection limit, while smooth Cu electrode showed FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 45%, FE(CO) of 12%, FE(CH 4 ) of 0.6%, respectively. However, FE(C 2 H 4 ) started to decrease 6 hours after the start of the reaction and decreased to 12% after 24 hours reaction. This could be caused by GDE soaking to electrolyte. To overcome these issues, we next investigated PTFE added porous Cu electrodes. PTFE was introduced into the porous Cu layer by electrostatic spray [10] .The introduction of PTFE further improved FE(C 2 H 4 ) from 48% to 55% and demonstrated over 80% of FE towards valuable C 2+ products at 300 mA cm -2 . PTFE introduction enhanced durability and resulted in FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 55% for over 24 hours. References [1] S. Nitopi, E. Bertheussen, S. B. Scott, X. Liu, A. K. Engstfeld, S. Horch, B. Seger, I. E.

Purpose China is experiencing an economic revolution focused on reducing carbon emissions (CEs). Various technological research and development (R&D) frameworks also hasten the growth of the digital economy, which then fuels this economic revolution. Nevertheless, several correlation uncertainties in China have been observed between R&D investment and CE reduction with green economic transformation. This phenomenon is attributed to insufficient spatial impact considerations. Design/methodology/approach Therefore, this article explored the spatial impacts of the digital economy and R&D expenditures regarding environmental quality using Chinese-related panel data between 2012 and 2021. This study uses the Moran I index to test whether there is a spatial relevance between regional carbon emissions in China and assess the digital economic advancement level using the entropy weight approach. In addition, this article analyzes the direct and indirect impacts following the partial differentiation approach, and then creates an interaction term between the digital economy and R&D investment to assess the moderating effect for examining the influence of investing in R&D on reducing CO2 levels of the digital economy. Findings A positive spatial relevance between the digital economy and CEs was then highlighted from the empirical findings. The digital economy expansion also demonstrated higher local CEs while negatively impacting nearby regions. Notably, the digital economy concurrently lowered and increased local CEs in the Eastern and Central zones, respectively. Overall, a larger R&D investment directly impacted the capacity of the digital economy in decreasing the carbon emission intensity (CEI) at a regional level. An accelerated digital economy expansion and lower CEI were recorded in the Eastern zone owing to more significant R&D investments. Research limitations/implications China has gradually shifted its focus from reducing CEs to implementing “dual control of carbon” to achieve the “dual carbon” target. Future studies should then involve additional studies concerning the impact mechanism and path selection related to “dual carbon control.” Practical implications Investment in R&D plays a key role in reducing carbon emissions from the digital economy. By fostering innovation and technological advances, R&D investment activities can create more energy-efficient digital infrastructures, develop sustainable practices and optimize resource use. In addition, these R&D investments can facilitate the transition to renewable energy sources, enhance data management systems to minimize waste and promote the adoption of green technologies by businesses and consumers. As the digital economy continues to evolve, prioritizing R&D in this area is critical to achieving long-term sustainable development goals and addressing the pressing challenges of climate change. Stakeholders across industries must therefore recognize the importance of investment in research and development as a strategic approach that not only drives economic growth but also ensures environmental stewardship in an increasingly digital world. Social implications Investments in research and development not only foster innovation and technological progress, but also promote sustainable practices, which can have significant environmental benefits. In addition, they have the potential to create new jobs, improve public health through better air quality and drive economic growth in a manner consistent with climate goals. As society becomes increasingly dependent on digital solutions, it is critical to harness the power of the digital economy to achieve a more sustainable and inclusive society. Originality/value Research development investment is critical to all aspects of regulation. Research on R&D investment can provide direction to local governments in formulating digital economy policies and can be beneficial to local governments in considering regional differences in resource availability. The research and technical innovation strategies in the policies for developing the digital economy can substantially expedite carbon neutrality achievement by 2060.

Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, wreaking havoc on the national pharmaceutical and medical supply industries, which are largely concentrated on the island.1 The impact was profound, particularly on the supply of small bags of intravenous (IV) fluids. For months afterward, hospitals across the United States struggled to obtain basic IV fluids, forcing clinicians to rethink how and when they used these products. The crisis highlighted the vulnerability of our healthcare supply chain to environmental disasters and underscored the need for more judicious use of IV fluids in the inpatient setting. In the wake of Hurricane Helene in September 2024, we find ourselves grappling with similar supply chain disruptions. By mid-October, ~86% of US physicians and providers had experienced IV fluid shortages.2 Some hospitals delayed noncritical surgeries3 and many hospitals continue to ration IV fluids until supplies return to their pre-Helene levels.4 These events, which are associated with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters due to climate change, demand long-term solutions. Hospitals face numerous challenges from extreme weather across the clinical care continuum. In addition to critical supply shortages, climate change and extreme weather can affect disease patterns (e.g., heat-related illness, injury, and vector-borne illnesses), resulting in care interruptions, and delay in diagnosis and treatment. As health care providers, it is incumbent upon us to not just treat the patient in front of us, but also to do our part in resource utilization to reduce waste and decrease patient care related greenhouse gas contributions and environmental harms that spur these events. Rather than relying on reactive and temporary workarounds, such as rationing supplies or importing from less-affected regions, it is time to reassess our dependency on IV fluids. While they are a cornerstone of inpatient care, used for everything from volume resuscitation in shock to rapid medication delivery, more environmentally sustainable, evidence-based practices exist that prioritize patient safety while conserving resources. We must also address the lack of supply chain resiliency and support broader efforts to reduce healthcare's large, negative environmental impact. There is growing evidence that IV fluids are often administered unnecessarily or continued longer than clinically indicated. The proportion of hospitalized patients who can safely receive oral hydration instead of IV fluids is likely substantial, particularly in cases where oral intake is feasible and safe. For patients with infectious diarrhea, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends oral rehydration solutions as the first line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration.5 In patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing contrast-enhanced CT or cardiac catheterization, oral hydration was as effective as IV hydration in preventing contrast-associated acute kidney injury.6, 7 Oral rehydration for clinically stable patients with hypernatremia has demonstrated safety in pediatric populations, and could be implemented for adult inpatients.8 Avoiding low-value practices restricting oral intake can reduce the use of IV fluids. Examples include shortening pre-procedure fasting times9 and early resumption of enteral nutrition for acute pancreatitis.10 Even for patients with dysphagia, a study by Leder et al. demonstrated that 90.7% of hospitalized patients who passed a 3-ounce water swallow challenge could be advanced to oral diets without subsequent signs of aspiration.11 Many medications such as antibiotics can be administered through IV push (like cefazolin and meropenem)12 or orally (as in azithromycin or fluroquinolones) with equal efficacy.13 IV proton pump inhibitors in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleed can be administered as infusions or intermittently as twice a day IV pushes or oral therapy after the initial 80 mg bolus, according to American College of Gastroenterology guidelines.14 Wherever fluids can be minimized, doing so provides multiple benefits including improved resource utilization and ease of nursing medication administration. Overuse in these cases is not only wasteful but also increases the risk of complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and prolonged hospital stays in patients with heart failure and other conditions. Moreover, the unnecessary use of IV lines increases the risk of infections and thrombophlebitis, adding to patient morbidity. Despite the evidence, excess use of IV fluids and medications remains a default practice in many hospitals. The reasons are multifaceted. Orders may be part of standard protocols, sometimes with little thought given to whether they are truly necessary. Many clinicians view IV fluid administration as a simple, low-risk intervention to "do something" for patients, especially where the clinical picture is uncertain. The complex nature of insurance reimbursements also contributes to this confusion, as the use of IV fluids and medications can be perceived as the difference between inpatient and observation status. This mindset contributes to a cycle of overuse that is difficult to break. Using IV fluids and medications more judiciously and developing better decision-making frameworks for fluid management also includes work to reduce our overall dependency on IV medications. A report by the Department of Health & Human Services identified more than 25% of drug and device manufacturers are located in areas at high risk of natural hazards including flooding, tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes.15 The climate change-induced disruptions caused by Hurricanes Maria and Helene offer opportunities to reevaluate our use of IV fluids. These events have forced hospitals to implement multifaceted measures aimed at conserving supplies, such as encouraging oral hydration when possible, limiting the use of IV fluids to critically ill patients, changing medications to oral equivalents, and more carefully monitoring fluid balance. From a greenhouse gas emissions perspective, the production of 500 mL of IV fluids generates about 0.5 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).16 If we can reduce annual usage by 25%, this could save emissions equivalent to driving a passenger car nearly 800,000 miles, or 285 trips from California to Maine in the United States. This rough estimate and other high-value care practices highlight the broader environmental benefits of simultaneously improving healthcare sustainability and potential cost reductions.17 Conservation strategies should not be seen as temporary measures but as part of a broader shift toward more mindful and evidence-based fluid management practices. Hospitals should consider implementing stricter guidelines for IV fluid administration. This includes regular reassessment of fluid needs, limiting automatic inclusion of IV fluids in admission orders, or requirements to reorder continuous IV fluids after a prespecified amount of time. Clinical decision support tools can help guide fluid management based on the patient's condition. For example, ask clinicians to consider if oral equivalents or oral hydration with fluid intake goals would be an appropriate first-line approach for patients with active diet orders. The practice of "keeping veins open" with IV fluids may also not be required as studies in the pediatric population suggest no difference between saline lock and continuous infusion on IV patency.18 As hospitalists, many of us are involved in administrative roles including resource utilization and supply chain issues as a part of process improvement and providing higher value. By taking steps now to reassess our utilization, we can create more resilient and adaptable healthcare systems better equipped to face the challenges of the future. This latest IV fluid shortage is not a supply chain anomaly. The COVID-19 pandemic is a lingering reminder that even the most basic elements of medical care are not immune to the forces of nature.19 Aside from causing severe equipment shortages, it also catapulted telehealth, once considered an aspirational next step for medicine, to the forefront of ambulatory care. Natural disasters, pandemics, and future unknown threats provide opportunities for innovation, improvement, and adoption of more sustainable practices. Rigorous and systematic research into best practices and disaster preparedness should be undertaken to inform our institutional policies and priorities given the increasing likelihood of future supply disruptions. Changing practice patterns will require more than updated guidelines and decision support tools. A cultural shift is necessary to reduce the default reliance on IV fluids and medications in inpatient care and to move to more sustainable hospital practice in general. This starts with education. Physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers need to be trained in the risks associated with unnecessary IV fluid use and the benefits of alternative approaches. They should also be apprised of the downstream environmental harms of hospital waste and overuse and how this can adversely impact our communities and patients.20 Medical schools and residency programs should emphasize evidence-based fluid management, teaching future clinicians to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of IV fluid administration. Continuing education programs for practicing providers can also help to reinforce these principles, especially in the context of supply chain vulnerabilities and disaster preparedness. Medical societies also have a role in driving sustainable healthcare delivery through clinical practice guidelines. Members of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health have committed to addressing climate change and health issues through their organizations and collectively through policy action and educational offerings. The frequent disruptions in IV fluid supplies due to climate disasters such as Hurricanes Maria and Helene highlight an urgent need to reduce overreliance on these products in the inpatient setting. We must seize this moment to promote smarter, evidence-based practices that not only conserve valuable resources but also enhance patient safety and care outcomes. This shift will require systemic changes, from updating clinical guidelines to fostering a culture that questions the routine use of IV fluids. By doing so, we can create a more resilient, patient-centered healthcare system capable of withstanding the growing pressures of climate-related disruptions (Table 1). The authors declare no conflict of interest.
