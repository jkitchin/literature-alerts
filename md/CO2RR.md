An electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way to reduce greenhouse gases by converting CO2 into high-value-added chemical products using electricity generated from renewable energy. In this paper, a Cu2O spherical catalyst was prepared by ascorbic acid reduction. The precipitated Cu-Ag spherical catalyst (P-CuO-Ag) was successfully prepared by calcining Cu2O-Ag with the introduction of an Ag component as the substrate. During the electrochemical reduction of CO2, the FE of the P-CuO-Ag catalyst for C2H4 at a potential of −1.1 V vs. RHE was as high as 39.8%, which was nearly twice that of the CuO catalyst, while the local current density JC2H4 for C2H4 reached 6 mA cm−2. The incorporation of Ag gives the spherical CuO catalyst higher electrochemical activity and better kinetic performance than the catalyst without Ag.

The field of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is pursuing high operating current densities, eventually controlled by CO2 transport. Here, we develop a new multiscale modeling approach that is able to more generally describe the effects of the electric double layer (EDL) on CO2 transport over a wide potential window extending to utmost potentials. By leveraging it, we identify a distinct CO2-run-out regime where the supply of CO2 runs out due to the EDL steric effect from a dense layer of solvated cations with the maximum layer thickness equal to the solvated cation size. Consequently, CO2RR current density drops at a relatively negative transition potential generating a bell-shaped polarization curve, which is in contrast to the CO2-transport-limited regime where the current density reaches a plateau. Furthermore, we develop a graphical method, verified by experimental data, to generally predict the transition to the CO2-run-out regime. This work sheds new light on the EDL effects for catalyst design and electrolyzer engineering.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to value‐added multicarbon (C2+) products offers a promising approach for achieving carbon neutrality and storing intermittent renewable energy. Copper (Cu)‐based electrocatalysts generally play the predominant role in this process. Yet recently, more and more non‐Cu materials have demonstrated the capability to convert CO2 into C2+, which provides impressive production efficiency even exceeding those on Cu, and a wider variety of C2+ compounds not achievable with Cu counterparts. This motivates us to organize the present review to make a timely and tutorial summary of recent progresses on developing non‐Cu based catalysts for CO2‐to‐C2+. We begin by elucidating the reaction pathways for C2+ formation, with an emphasis on the unique C‐C coupling mechanisms in non‐Cu electrocatalysts. Subsequently, we summarize the typical C2+‐involved non‐Cu catalysts, including ds‐, d‐ and p‐block metals, as well as metal‐free materials, presenting the state‐of‐the‐art design strategies to enhance C2+ efficiency. The system upgrading to promote C2+ productivity on non‐Cu electrodes covering microbial electrosynthesis, electrolyte engineering, regulation of operational conditions, and synergistic co‐electrolysis, is highlighted as well. Our review concludes with an exploration of the challenges and future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract Traditional catalytic techniques often encounter obstacles in the search for sustainable solutions for converting CO 2 into value-added products because of their high energy consumption and expensive catalysts. Here, we introduce a contact-electro-catalysis approach for CO 2 reduction reaction, achieving a CO Faradaic efficiency of 96.24%. The contact-electro-catalysis is driven by a triboelectric nanogenerator consisting of electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride loaded with single Cu atoms-anchored polymeric carbon nitride (Cu-PCN) catalysts and quaternized cellulose nanofibers (CNF). Mechanistic investigation reveals that the single Cu atoms on Cu-PCN can effectively enrich electrons during contact electrification, facilitating electron transfer upon their contact with CO 2 adsorbed on quaternized CNF. Furthermore, the strong adsorption of CO 2 on quaternized CNF allows efficient CO 2 capture at low concentrations, thus enabling the CO 2 reduction reaction in the ambient air. Compared to the state-of-the-art air-based CO 2 reduction technologies, contact-electro-catalysis achieves a superior CO yield of 33 μmol g −1 h −1 . This technique provides a solution for reducing airborne CO 2 emissions while advancing chemical sustainability strategy.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value‐added chemicals by renewable energy sources is a promising way to implement the artificial carbon cycle. During the reaction, especially at high current densities for practical applications, the complex interaction between the key intermediates and the active sites would affect the selectivity, while the reconfiguration of electrocatalysts could restrict the stability. This paper describes the fabrication of Ag/C catalysts with a well‐engineered interfacial structure, in which Ag nanoparticles are partially encapsulated by C supports. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits CO Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of over 90% at current densities even as high as 1.1 A/cm2. The strong interfacial interaction between Ag and C leads to highly localized electron density that promotes the rate‐determining electron transfer step by enhancing the adsorption and the stabilization of the key *COO‒ intermediate. In addition, the partially encapsulated structure prevents the reconfiguration of Ag during the reaction. Stable performance for over 600 h at 500 mA/cm2 is achieved with CO FE maintaining over 95%, which is among the best stability with such a high selectivity and current density. This work provides a novel catalyst design showing the potential for the practical application of electrochemical reduction of CO2.

China has identified the synergistic reduction of pollution and carbon emissions as a critical component of its environmental protection and climate mitigation efforts. An assessment of this synergy can provide clarity on the strategic management of both air pollution and carbon emissions. Due to the extensive regional differences in China, the spatial effects of influencing factors on this synergy exhibit variation across different provinces. In this study, the reduction indexes of PM2.5 and CO2 were calculated based on their reduction bases, reduction efforts, and reduction stabilities across provinces. Then, the synergistic reduction effect was assessed using an exponential function with the PM2.5 reduction index as the base and the CO2 reduction index as the exponent. Next, the MGWR model was applied in order to analyze the influencing factors of the synergistic reduction effect, considering natural settings, socioeconomic conditions, and external emission impacts. Finally, the k-means clustering method was utilized to classify provinces into different categories based on the degree of impact of each influencing factor. The results indicated that air circulation, vegetation, tertiary industry ratio, and emission reduction efficiency are major impact indicators that have a positive effect. The topography and emissions from neighboring provinces have a statistically significant negative impact. The spatial influences of different factors exhibit a distribution trend characterized by a high-high cluster and a low-low cluster. A total of 31 provinces are divided into three categories, and suggestions on the corresponding category are proposed, to provide a scientific reference to the synergistic reduction of PM2.5 and CO2.

The testing and evaluation of catalysts in CO2 electroreduction is a very tedious process. To study the catalytic system of CO2 reduction more quickly and efficiently, it is necessary to establish a method that can detect multiple catalysts at the same time. Herein, a series of CuBi bimetallic catalysts have been successfully prepared on a single glass carbon electrode by a scanning micropieptte contact method. The application of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) enabled the visualization of the CO2 reduction activity in diverse catalyst micro‐points. The SECM imaging with Substrate generation/tip collection (SG/TC) mode was conducted on CuBi bimetallic micro‐points, revealing that HER reaction emerged as the prevailing reaction when a low overpotential was employed. While the applied potential was lower than ‐1.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl), the reduction of CO2 to formic acid became dominant. Increasing the bismuth proportion in the bimetallic catalyst can inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction at low potential and enhances the selectivity of the CO product at high cathode overpotential.This research offers a novel approach to examining arrays of catalysts for CO2 reduction.

Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) was investigated in either organic or aqueous/organic media by employing three water-soluble Rh(Cp*)(n,n’-dihydroxy-2,2’-bipyridine) (n = 4, 5, or 6) in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) and triethanolamine (TEOA). Through studying the electron-donating effects of two hydroxyl groups introduced to the bipyridyl ligand, we found that the substituent positions greatly affect both the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction. More importantly, the HCOOH selectivity shows a dramatic increase from 14% to 83% upon switching the solvent media from pure organic to aqueous/organic mixture, where the H2 selectivity shows a reverse phenomenon. The enhanced HCOOH selectivity and the drastic decrease in the apparent H2 yield are well rationalized by the fact that the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation by the evolved H2 simultaneously proceeds as a dark catalytic reaction, which was also separately investigated under the dark conditions. Our DFT studies unveil that the exceptionally large structural strain given by the steric contacts between the 6,6’-dihydroxyl groups and the Cp* moiety plays a significant role in bringing about an outstanding catalytic performance of the 6,6’-subsituted derivative. The intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were carried out to clarify the mechanism of hydride transfer steps leading to generate formate together the heterolytic H2 cleavage steps leading to afford the key hydridorhodium intermediates. This study represents the first report on the water-induced high selectivity in CO2-to-HCOOH conversion, shedding a new light on the strategy to control the efficiency and selectivity in the catalysis of CO2 reduction.

The synthesis of multicarbon (C2+) products remains a substantial challenge in sustainable CO2 electroreduction owing to the need for sufficient current density and faradaic efficiency alongside carbon efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate ampere‐level high‐efficiency CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products in both neutral and strongly acidic (pH = 1) electrolytes using a hierarchical Cu hollow‐fiber penetration electrode (HPE). High concentration of K+ could concurrently suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitate C–C coupling, thereby promoting C2+ production in strong acid. By optimizing the K+ and H+ concentration and CO2 flow rate, a faradaic efficiency of 84.5% and a partial current density as high as 3.1 A cm–2 for C2+ products, alongside a single‐pass carbon efficiency of 81.5% and stable electrolysis for 240 h were demonstrated in a strong acidic solution of H2SO4 and KCl (pH = 1). Experimental measurements and density functional theory simulations suggested that tensile‐strained Cu HPE enhances the asymmetric C–C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of C2+ products.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the construction of road infrastructure have been of growing interest in recent years. This paper proposes a binary statistical method for highway construction based on project cost control and a construction management system. A quantitative analysis of the CO2 emissions from highway construction activities was also conducted to guide the formulation of a carbon reduction strategy. Taking an expressway in central China as a case study, the CO2 emissions from different construction activities were calculated. The results revealed that the CO2 emissions for the whole construction project reached 10,605.2 t·km−1·lane−1, with the raw material production and on-site construction phases accounting for 95.2% and 4.8%, respectively. The values for bridge and tunnel engineering were much higher than those for other engineering types. In the raw material production phase, steel and cement production contributed the most to emissions (more than 99%). During the on-site construction phase, diesel and electricity consumption contributed 90% to CO2 emissions, especially from earthwork, subgrade protection, bridge engineering, tunnel excavation, and pavement surfacing. Accordingly, efforts should be focused on the key points and directed toward using recycled and low-carbon materials and improving working efficiency, machinery performance, and construction technology.

Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has emerged in recent years as a promising decarbonization solution for hard-to-abate industries. Compared to carbon capture and storage (CCS), CCU aims not for the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) but for its use in the production of synthetic fuels, such as synthetic methanol (MeOH). Synthetic MeOH is produced through CO2 hydrogenation, utilizing green hydrogen (H2). Efficient use of CO2 and H2 feedstocks is essential to maximize the carbon reduction potential and energy efficiency of the process. This study performed an optimization analysis on a small-scale, containerized, and portable CO2 hydrogenation unit with a 5 kg MeOH/h production capacity goal, focusing on carbon conversion efficiency (CCE), MeOH yield, H2 consumption, and MeOH purity. The analysis was conducted using Aspen Plus V12. A single-pass model was used first to evaluate an initial reactor design. The reactor was then re-designed according to the results of the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). The model was then expanded to include a recycling loop and the final reactor design was validated, aiming to maximize overall efficiency. The effects of the operational parameters including the reactor inlet temperature, reactor pressure, thermal fluid temperature, and condensation temperature were examined. The model was then further expanded to include the MeOH distillation process, and the effect of the distillation temperature was examined. The final product of the analysis was a fully-defined and optimized unit, achieving an 87.97% CCE and an 84.99% MeOH yield, consuming 1.11 kg H2/h for the production of 5.01 kg MeOH/h of 99.86 wt% purity. This study can provide valuable information and guidelines for designing small-scale, containerized, and portable CO2 hydrogenation units, which can serve as alternative solutions to address issues of H2 production and transportation related to large-scale installations.

Abstract Drought, a potent natural climatic phenomenon, significantly challenges hydropower systems, bearing adverse consequences for economies, societies, and the environment. This study delves into the profound impact of drought on hydropower generation in the United States, revealing a robust correlation between hydrologic drought and hydroelectricity generation. Our analysis of the period from 2003 to 2020 for the Contiguous United States (CONUS) indicates that drought events led to a considerable decline in hydroelectricity generation, amounting to approximately 300 million MWh, and resulting in an estimated loss of $28 billion to the sector. Moreover, our findings highlight the adverse environmental effect of drought-induced hydropower generation reductions, which are often compensated by increased reliance on natural gas usage, which led to substantial emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxide (NOX), totaling 161,700 kilotons, 119,9 tons, and 181,977 tons, respectively. In addition to these findings, we assess the state-level vulnerability of hydropower to drought, identifying Washington and California as the most vulnerable states, while Nevada exhibits the least vulnerability. Overall, this study enhances understanding of the multifaceted effects of drought on hydropower, which can assist in informing policies and practices related to drought management and energy production.

As the main contributor of carbon emissions, the low-carbon transition of the industrial sector is important for achieving the goal of carbon dioxide peaking. Hydrogen-enabled industrial energy systems (HIESs) are a promising way to achieve the low-carbon transition of industrial energy systems, since the hydrogen can be well coordinated with renewable energy sources and satisfy the high and continuous industrial energy demand. In this paper, the long-term capacity expansion planning problem of the HIES is formulated from the perspective of industrial parks, and the targets of carbon dioxide peaking and the gradual decommissioning of existing equipment are considered as constraints. The results show that the targets of carbon dioxide peaking before different years or with different emission reduction targets can be achieved through the developed method, while the economic performance is ensured to some extent. Meanwhile, the overall cost of the strategy based on purchasing emission allowance is three times more than the cost of the strategy obtained by the developed method, while the emissions of the two strategies are same. In addition, long-term carbon reduction policies and optimistic expectations for new energy technologies will help industrial parks build more new energy equipment for clean transformation.

Question Dyspnoea persisting despite treatments of underlying causes requires symptomatic approaches. Medical hypnosis could provide relief without the untoward effects of pharmacological approaches. We addressed this question through experimentally induced dyspnoea in healthy humans (inspiratory threshold loading –excessive inspiratory effort– and carbon dioxide stimulation –air hunger–) Material and Methods 20 volunteers (10 women, 21–40) were studied on 4 separate days. The order of the visits was randomised in two steps, firstly “inspiratory threshold loading first” versus “carbon dioxide first” group (n=10 in each group), secondly “medical hypnosis first” versus “visual distraction first” subgroup (n=5 in each subgroup). Each visit comprised three 5-minutes periods (reference, intervention, washout) during which participants used visual analog scales to rate dyspnoea's sensory and affective dimensions and after which they completed the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile. Results Medical hypnosis reduced both dimensions of dyspnoea significantly more than visual distraction (inspiratory threshold loading: sensory reduction after 5 min 34% of full VAS versus 8% –p=0.0042–; affective reduction 17.6% versus 2.4% –p=0.044–; carbon dioxide; sensory reduction after 5 min 36.9% versus 3% –p=0.0015–; affective reduction 29.1% versus 8.7% –p=0.0023–). The Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile showed more marked sensory effects during inspiratory threshold loading and more marked affective effects during carbon dioxide stimulation. Answer to the question Medical hypnosis was more effective than visual distraction at attenuating the sensory and affective dimensions of experimentally induced dyspnoea. This provides a strong rationale for clinical studies of hypnosis in persistent dyspnoea patients.    

    

## Renewable Energy, Economic Policy Uncertainty and Climate Policy Uncertainty: New Evidence for Environmental Kuznets Curve from Emerging and Developed Countries

Recent events, such as the financial crisis, oil price shocks or fluctuations, Brexit, the US–China trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia–Ukraine conflict and the subsequent energy crisis, have surged global economic policy uncertainty. As climate change has recently been more pronounced around the globe, discussions about climate policies and related uncertainties have also become a major concern. This study investigates the role of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and climate policy uncertainty (CPU) on climate change (environmental degradation) for selected emerging and developed economies, expanding the IPAT framework and merging it with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The IPAT framework examines the impact (I) of population (P), affluence (A), and technology (T) on the environment, whereas the EKC hypothesis proposes an inverted U-shaped curve between affluence and environmental degradation. Two models were created and tested for emerging and developed countries, namely Model 1 with EPU and Model 2 with CPU. A Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator is employed to investigate the interrelation between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and selected variables; namely the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, squared real GDP per capita, renewable share in consumption, the EPU, the CPU and population. Test results indicate that the EKC hypothesis is verified only in Model 1 and for emerging countries, whereas population escalates climate change in both country groups. Furthermore, in line with the consumption effect theorized earlier in the literature, EPU is negatively related to carbon emissions in emerging countries. Thus, the EPU leads to a decrease in the use of energy and pollution-intensive commodities and mitigates climate change in EMEs. Compatible with our ex-ante expectations, renewable energy consumption alleviates climate change in both country groups in the short term. In Model 2, with CPU, we find no evidence supporting the EKC hypothesis for any country groups. However, we reaffirm that renewable energy consumption decreases CO2 emissions in developed countries, which is in support of the argument that energy transition holds the key to tackling climate change. Finally, CPU is associated with a decrease in CO2 emissions in emerging countries in the short term, potentially leading to a reduction in overall economic activity and alleviating climate change. This might also be attributable to the fact that the decisions of economic agents substantially rely on current and future policy (both economic and climate) expectations. Overall, verifying the EKC hypothesis for emerging countries in Model 1, we might argue that there is good potential for emerging countries to save money and time on environmental costs via the adoption of clean technologies and related policies. Last but not least, on a global scale, energy transition with better utilization of renewable sources holds the key to tackling climate change and reducing emissions.

Based on the double-carbon target, the agricultural sector has implemented the concept of being green and synergistically promoted pollution and carbon reduction. Positioned as a novel financial paradigm, green finance places greater emphasis on environmental stewardship compared to its traditional counterparts. This focus enhances resource allocation efficiency, thereby achieving the goal of reducing pollution and carbon emissions. To research the influence of green finance on agricultural pollution and carbon reduction, this study leverages panel data spanning 2011 to 2021 from 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across China. It employs the fixed-effect model and mediating-effect model. The findings reveal that: (1) Green finance exerts a notable influence on reducing both pollution and carbon emissions in agriculture, with the latter showing a more pronounced effect. (2) Regional disparities exist in green finance, affecting agricultural pollution and carbon reduction. (3) By fostering technological innovation and optimizing industrial frameworks, green finance emerges as a catalyst for curbing surface pollution and carbon dioxide emissions in agriculture. On this basis, relevant suggestions are put forward to provide policy insights for improving the green financial system, which will help further promote carbon and pollution reduction.

At the 75th United Nations General Assembly, China committed to peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. In response, the national standard “General Specification for Building Energy Conservation and Utilization of Renewable Energy” has been adopted across 20 provinces and cities in seven major regions, including North China, Northeast China, and South China. These regions have implemented stringent energy-saving and emission reduction reviews and quota requirements. Despite this, there is limited research on comprehensive life cycle carbon emission calculations and carbon reduction designs. This study addresses this gap by focusing on economically developed regions with high population density and substantial energy-saving potential, specifically targeting the warm winter and hot summer regions of China. Using a commercial building in Shenzhen as a case study, we established a carbon emission accounting model based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. We calculated carbon emissions during the material phase using the project’s bill of quantities and relevant carbon emission factors. Additionally, we used the CEEB 2023 software to design energy-saving and emission reduction solutions for the building. Our comparative analysis reveals that the new design reduces the carbon emissions of the case study building by 13.5%. This reduction not only mitigates the environmental impact of construction but also contributes to the fight against the greenhouse effect, supporting the broader goal of sustainable development.

The implications of minimum wage standards have been widely debated, but their effects on firms’ pollution emissions and the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. This paper finds that the introduction of minimum wage standards significantly reduces emissions of pollutants such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Firms respond to rising minimum wages by optimizing their product mix, enhancing technological innovation, and improving managerial efficiency, which collectively curb pollution outputs. Our analysis using a random forest model shows that these effects are most pronounced in regions with higher economic development, stringent environmental regulations, and elevated minimum wage standards. Our findings augment the body of research on minimum wage standards and introduce novel insights for emission reduction strategies for firms.

Abstract The paper addresses the imperative of empowering enterprises to achieve energy savings and emission reductions through digital development amidst the backdrop of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality. This study integrates digital empowerment and enterprise carbon risk management into a unified analytical framework, utilising panel data from listed companies spanning from 2011 to 2020 as research samples. The empirical investigation aims to ascertain whether there exist carbon risks impacting the operational performance of manufacturing enterprises and whether digital empowerment can mitigate these risks. The findings reveal that carbon intensity exerts an inhibitory influence on the enhancement of enterprise performance, indicating the presence of carbon risk issues faced by enterprises. Furthermore, it is observed that these carbon risk challenges escalate over time, a trend supported by robustness tests. Digital empowerment emerges as an effective mechanism in slowing down the carbon risks encountered by enterprises, albeit exhibiting characteristics of time lag. The study identifies notable heterogeneity in the role of digital empowerment in mitigating the carbon risks of enterprises.

This contribution shows the co-benefits of an optimal deployment of renewable energy infrastructure, particularly wind and solar photovoltaics, on air quality and associated health impact. The term "optimal" here specifically refers to leveraging the spatio-temporal complementarity of both resources in order to minimize the fluctuations of their combined electricity production, and so easing their integration in the energy mix. In a previous work by Jerez et al. (2023), the open-access CLIMAX tool was developed for that purpose, and utilized to delineate optimal capacity density scenarios across five European regions. We now show that, under these optimized scenarios, the European CO2-equivalent emissions could decrease by 1%, accompanied by a significant reduction in pollutant emissions from combustion power plants, potentially amounting to hundreds of kilotons of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide saved. Exposure to these contaminants caused approximately three hundred thousands deaths in Europe in 2021, as reported by EEA (2023). In this sense, building upon the methodology employed by Tar&#237;n-Carrasco et al. (2021), our estimates corroborate that implementing the CLIMAX scenarios could substantially avoid human fatalities associated with air pollution. Hence, pursuing carbon neutrality through a judicious energy transition emerges as a win-win strategy. Not only does it contribute to climate change mitigation by curbing greenhouse gas emissions, but it also fosters healthier, more breathable environments, thus preventing premature mortality as it relates to poor air quality.

Abstract The decline in global plant diversity has raised concerns about its implications for carbon fixation and global greenhouse gas emissions (GGE), including carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ). Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive meta‐analysis of 2103 paired observations, examining GGE, soil organic carbon (SOC) and plant carbon in plant mixtures and monocultures. Our findings indicate that plant mixtures decrease soil N 2 O emissions by 21.4% compared to monocultures. No significant differences occurred between mixtures and monocultures for soil CO 2 emissions, CH 4 emissions or CH 4 uptake. Plant mixtures exhibit higher SOC and plant carbon storage than monocultures. After 10 years of vegetation development, a 40% reduction in species richness decreases SOC content and plant carbon storage by 12.3% and 58.7% respectively. These findings offer insights into the intricate connections between plant diversity, soil and plant carbon storage and GGE—a critical but previously unexamined aspect of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning.

Relevance. Agroforestry systems are believed to provide a multitude of ecological services. It is thought that agroforestry enhances resilience to the impacts of climate change and aids in adaptation by supporting diverse land use practices, sustainable lifestyles, and income streams, as well as increasing productivity in both forests and agriculture, and reducing weather-related losses in production. Results and Discussion. The aim of this review was to present genuine evidence on the role of agroforestry in ecosystem conservation and mitigation of climate change impacts. Compared to monocropping and open cereal-based agriculture, agroforestry has made a more significant contribution to ecosystem conservation and in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, it has been found that agroforestry contributes less to carbon sequestration than natural forests. Carbon sequestration through above-ground and underground biomass, carbon emission reduction from deforestation, and microclimate adjustment are key measures for mitigating climate change. Agroforestry systems provide essential ecosystem services, such as food, fuel wood, fodder, income, and improved soil production, which enable communities to cope better with the impacts of climate change. Therefore, agroforestry must be given significant attention if it is to play a crucial role in ecosystem management.

Copper‐based catalysts are frequently employed for carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO 2 RR), yet the regulation of pore structure and surface state of electrocatalysts remains a prominent challenge in previous research endeavors. In this study, we introduce a novel technique to produce mesoporous Cu 2 O nanocrystals, with finely tuned pore size and surface amine functionality leveraging the incorporation of various amine compounds during the oxidative process of copper nanocrystals. The synergistic effect of pore structure confinement and surface amine functionalization culminates in an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 51.9% for the selective production of C 2 H 4 .

Abstract The International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40% by 2030 compared with 2008. The carbon intensity indicator (CII) calculates the annual reduction factor required to continuously improve a ship's operational carbon intensity at a specific rating level. Verification and documentation of the achieved annual operational CII against the prescribed target are necessary to establish the operational carbon intensity rating. This study focuses on the intricate process of data collection for CII within the oil shipping industry, targeting engineering departments and shipboard management teams. Against the backdrop of the industry's substantial carbon dioxide emissions, the IMO has mandated the calculation of CII values for ships exceeding 5000 gross tons to promote sustainability and reduce environmental impact. We have collected emission data of 20 oil tankers over a period of 2 years using our ship maintenance and operating system (SMOS) and analyzed the data to compare the CII ratings. Our results indicate that a staggering ~63% of the vessels had the lowest CII rating of category E. It is therefore crucial to properly collect, organize, and evaluate data for CII calculation and take necessary measures to improve rating. This paper provides a deeper insight into the evolving CII calculation methodology, emphasizing the incorporation of correction factors and exclusions, and delineates the essential data collection practices needed to facilitate accurate CII calculations.

With the requirement of energy decarbonization, natural gas (NG) and hydrogen (H2) become increasingly important in the world’s energy landscape. The liquefaction of NG and H2 significantly increases energy density, facilitating large-scale storage and long-distance transport. However, conventional liquefaction processes mainly adopt electricity-driven compression refrigeration technology, which generally results in high energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Absorption refrigeration technology (ART) presents a promising avenue for enhancing energy efficiency and reducing emissions in both NG and H2 liquefaction processes. Its ability to utilize industrial waste heat and renewable thermal energy sources over a large temperature range makes it particularly attractive for sustainable energy practices. This review comprehensively analyzes the progress of ART in terms of working pairs, cycle configurations, and heat and mass transfer in main components. To operate under different driven heat sources and refrigeration temperatures, working pairs exhibit a diversified development trend. The environment-friendly and high-efficiency working pairs, in which ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are new absorbents, exhibit promising development potential. Through the coupling of heat and mass transfer within the cycle or the addition of sub-components, cycle configurations with higher energy efficiency and a wider range of operational conditions are greatly focused. Additives, ultrasonic oscillations, and mechanical treatment of heat exchanger surfaces efficiently enhance heat and mass transfer in the absorbers and generators of ART. Notably, nanoparticle additives and ultrasonic oscillations demonstrate a synergistic enhancement effect, which could significantly improve the energy efficiency of ART. For the conventional NG and H2 liquefaction processes, the energy-saving and carbon emission reduction potential of ART is analyzed from the perspectives of specific power consumption (SPC) and carbon dioxide emissions (CEs). The results show that ART integrated into the liquefaction processes could reduce the SPC and CE by 10~38% and 10~36% for NG liquefaction processes, and 2~24% and 5~24% for H2 liquefaction processes. ART, which can achieve lower precooling temperatures and higher energy efficiency, shows more attractive perspectives in low carbon emissions of NG and H2 liquefaction.

Abstract Electrochemical co-reduction of nitrate (NO 3 – ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has been widely regarded as a promising route to produce urea under ambient conditions, however the yield rate of urea has remained limited. Here, we report an atomically ordered intermetallic pallium-zinc (PdZn) electrocatalyst comprising a high density of PdZn pairs for boosting urea electrosynthesis. It is found that Pd and Zn are responsible for the adsorption and activation of NO 3 – and CO 2 , respectively, and thus the co-adsorption and co-activation NO 3 – and CO 2 are achieved in ordered PdZn pairs. More importantly, the ordered and well-defined PdZn pairs provide a dual-site geometric structure conducive to the key C–N coupling with a low kinetical barrier, as demonstrated on both operando measurements and theoretical calculations. Consequently, the PdZn electrocatalyst displays excellent performance for the co-reduction to generate urea with a maximum urea Faradaic efficiency of 62.78% and a urea yield rate of 1274.42 μg mg –1 h –1 , and the latter is 1.5-fold larger than disordered pairs in PdZn alloys. This work paves new pathways to boost urea electrosynthesis via constructing ordered dual-metal pairs.

As a highly energy-intensive and carbon-emitting industry with significant emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the petroleum and chemical industry is a major contributor to the global greenhouse effect and ozone layer destruction. Improper treatment of petrochemical waste gas (PWG) seriously harms human health and the natural environment. This study uses CiteSpace and VOSviewer to conduct a scientometric analysis of 1384 scholarly works on PWG and carbon sequestration published between 1981 and 2022, revealing the basic characteristics, knowledge base, research topic evolution, and research hotspots of the field. The results show the following: (1) In the early stages of the petrochemical industry, it was processed tail gas, plant leakage waste gas, and combustion flue gas that were investigated in PWG research. (2) Later, green environmental protection technology was widely studied in the field of PWG treatment, such as biotechnology, catalytic oxidation technology, membrane separation technology, etc., in order to achieve efficient, low energy consumption and low emissions of waste gas treatment, and the number of publications related to this topic has increased rapidly. In addition, researchers studied the internet of things and technology integration, such as the introduction of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and other technologies, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of exhaust gas monitoring, control, and management. (3) The department has focused on how to reduce emissions by optimizing petrochemical process lines or improving energy efficiency. Emission reduction and low-carbon transition in the petrochemical industry will become the main trend in the future. Switching from renewable carbon to feedstock carbon derived from captured carbon dioxide, biomass, or recycled chemicals has become an attractive strategy to help curb emissions from the chemical industry. The results of our analysis can provide funding agencies and research groups with information to better understand the global trends and directions that have emerged in this field from 1981 to 2022 and serve as a reference for future research.

Abstract: CeOx-YSZ electrode performed well for CO2 electro-reduction in both pure CO2 and CO2 (+H2) feeds.. In pure CO2, operando Raman and online mass spectroscopy studies revealed that, upon application of the bias, CO production correlated with the reduction of Ce4+ sites to Ce3+ sites as evidenced by decay in the intensity of the Raman band at 450 cm-1 (α). The electronic conductivity increased with applied bias due to an increase in Ce3+ sites. The addition of H2 (~5%) resulted in reverse Water Gas Shift reaction and an additional Raman band at 480 cm-1 (φ). The CO formation was more facile in presence of H2 at a lower bias compared to the pure CO2 stream. The electronic conductivity showed a slight dip at low biases (5% H2) due to the reoxidation of Ce3+ sites to Ce4+-H- (hydridic) sites. Both H2 and CO2 concentrations positively correlated with CO formation and supressed H2O electrolysis. First principles-based calculations indicate that adsorption of H into bulk makes it easier to create oxygen defect in CeO2 making the creation of Ce3+ sites easier. When adsorbed around oxygen defects the H acquires a hydridic (H-) nature. The φ band is likely to be associated with phonon modes containing H adsorbed around undefective sites. No coking was observed in both pure CO2 and CO2 (+H2) feed streams.

Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) serves as a sustainable method to transform pine needle waste into nitrogen-doped (N-doped) hydrochars. The primary focus is on evaluating these hydrochars as catalytic electrodes for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which are pivotal processes with significant environmental implications. Hydrochars were synthesized by varying the parameters such as nitrogen loading, temperature, and residence time. These materials were then thoroughly characterized using diverse analytical techniques, including elemental analysis, density measurements, BET surface area analysis, and spectroscopies like Raman, FTIR, and XPS, along with optical and scanning electron microscopies. The subsequent electrochemical assessment involved preparing electrocatalytic inks by combining hydrochars with an anion exchange ionomer (AEI) to leverage their synergistic effects. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports on catalytic electrodes that simultaneously incorporate both a hydrochar and AEI. Evaluation metrics such as current densities, onset and half-wave potentials, and Koutecky–Levich and Tafel plots provided insights into their electrocatalytic performances. Notably, hydrochars synthesized at 230 °C exhibited an onset potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE, marking the highest reported value for a hydrochar. They also facilitated the exchange of four electrons at 0.26 V vs. RHE in the ORR. Additionally, the CO2RR yielded valuable C2 products like acetaldehyde and acetate. These findings highlight the remarkable electrocatalytic activity of the optimized hydrochars, which could be attributed, at least in part, to their optimal porosity.

Biomass gasification is emerging as a promising technology for producing hydrogen, addressing the dual challenges of sustainable energy supply and environmental conservation. This process converts biomass into syngas—a mixture primarily composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide—through thermal decomposition in a controlled environment. The syngas is then processed to extract hydrogen, which can serve as a clean fuel for various applications, including transportation and industrial processes. This paper provides an overview of the biomass gasification process, detailing suitable biomass feedstock types and gasifier types, such as fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, and entrained-flow gasifiers. It explores the conversion of syngas to hydrogen, highlighting essential catalytic reforming and purification techniques for producing high-purity hydrogen. The environmental benefits of this technology includes the utilization of renewable resources and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production. Economically, biomass gasification offers a feasible pathway for decentralized hydrogen production, potentially lowering transportation costs and enhancing energy security, especially in biomass-rich regions. However, the deployment of biomass gasification technology is not void of challenges – some common challenges with biomass gasification technology include coping with the variability of biomass feedstock, tar formation, and the need for technological advancements to improve efficiency and scalability. This paper also discusses ongoing research and potential innovations aimed at overcoming these obstacles, ensuring biomass gasification's viability as a key player in the future hydrogen economy. Through case studies and real-world applications, this paper illustrates the practical implementation and successes of biomass gasification projects, offering valuable insights into best practices and lessons learned. In conclusion, biomass gasification stands out as a sustainable and economically viable solution for hydrogen production, with the potential to significantly advance global clean energy goals.

The relevance of research is conditioned by the need to ensure efficient operation of the internal combustion engine ICE on NGV fuel at different altitudes above sea level, where there is atmospheric air rarefaction up to 20÷25%. This direction is dictated by the fact that when transferring the ICE operation from gasoline to gas-engine fuel, the engine power decreases from 5 to 15%, moreover, the atmospheric air rarefaction leads to an even greater reduction in engine power and ultimately reduces the performance of the vehicle. Due to violation of the process of combustion of gas-air charge in the cylinder is formed a large amount of carbon monoxide (CO). Research objective is to develop and propose a method of providing such a stoichiometric, fractional composition of the gas-air charge, which will ensure the restoration of the lost power of ICE and provide the optimal value of traction-dynamic characteristics of the car, without increasing toxic emissions. Research object: Variable crosssectional area of the intake manifold path (ICE), adjustable lumen for atmospheric air intake, atmospheric air pressure sensors adjustable diaphragm with stepper motor. Research methods: analytical modeling of the relationship of the aperture diameter depending on the altitude of the terrain above sea level, on the number of revolutions of the ICE, on the density and temperature of the ambient air. The process of combustion of the gas-air charge in the combustion chamber will be evaluated by the fractional composition of the exhaust, exhaust gases. Research results: Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the application of altitude corrector on the ICE operation mode, stability of the value of excess air ratio at different altitudes above sea level, formation of toxic gas, carbon monoxide, as well as carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, oxygen, etc. is given.

Copper-based nanoparticles are key electrocatalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2 ER) to liquid fuels and other value-added products. However, the copper catalyst can undergo rapid electrochemical corrosion, leading to a loss of catalyst material, fluctuations in the reaction conditions and increasing operational costs. We establish a mechanistic understanding of this detrimental process using in situ electrochemical electron microscopy and density functional theory (DFT). We find that copper corrosion can occur in the presence of CO2 in electroless conditions and before the onset potentials required for CO2 ER. The effects are isolated from pH changes resulting from dissolved CO2. Particles of corroded copper have oxidized surfaces, in contrast to copper surfaces exposed to CO2-free electrolytes. DFT calculations identify multiple routes by which CO2 can behave as a dissolution agent for copper and copper-oxide surfaces and suggest that formate-intermediates are a key driver of corrosion. This study highlights microenvironment-based factors that affect copper performance and degradation, facilitating strategies to inhibit and reverse copper degradation during CO2 ER.

Abstract Highly selective conversion of CO2 into CO molecules remains a major challenge in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions, and metallic silver-based materials have great potential. However, the selectivity and activity of traditional silver (Ag)-based materials cannot reach the desired level, and the development of new Ag-based materials has become a hot research topic. Here, novel ag-glomerated spore-shaped Ag nanomaterials are reported for the efficient reduction of CO2 to CO. The unique nanostructures endowed with larger specific surface area, and the spore-like dispersed Ag nanoparticles (NPs) have more unsaturated Ag sites, which endowed the catalysts with higher intrinsic activity. Electrochemical tests show that spore-like Ag can obtain a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 95.6% at -1 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of Ag nanowires (NWs) (73%) and ordinary Ag NPs (83%) synthesized in the same period. By using the three different morphologies of Ag synthesized as a research platform and statistically comparing the FE in the corresponding voltage interval, we obtained the influence of morphology effect on the selectivity of CO product production by electrocatalytic CO2 production over Ag-based catalysts, which can be further used as a guideline for catalyst development.

High hydrogen yields have been obtained continuously from steam reforming of methane coupled with simultaneous CO2 capture[1], at lower temperature (630oC) and pressure (1 atm) than those typical of traditional processes (800-900oC,15-30 atm), using calcined dolomite and a pulverized commercial Ni catalyst, in a single step. On the other hand, a pure CO2 stream is obtained by subsequent regeneration of the sorbent, which could be stored. A bubbling fluidized bed contained in a quartz vessel was operated batchwise. First, the durability of a dolomite in multi-cycle CO2 sorption/desorption runs has been investigated: a remarkable reduction of dolomite activity is observed after the first calcination, but substantially stable activity was conserved up to the fifth cycle. Then the performance of sorption enhanced catalytic steam reforming of methane to pure hydrogen has been evaluated. Two well distinct operation regimes have been found: before dolomite saturation, H2 concentration in the dry product gas remained stable at 94-96%, and CO2 was completely converted into calcium carbonate; after a short breakthrough period, concentration of H2 at the exit of the reactor reduced its value that became approximately equal to the equilibrium value expected for methane reforming and water gas shift reactions.

In this study, a twin-screw extruder was used to fabricate poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends and blend-based nanocomposites with carbon nanotube (CNT) or nanocarbon black (CB) as nanofillers. The fabricated samples were subsequently treated with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) to fabricate the corresponding foams. Bi-phasic morphology and selective distribution of CNTs or CBs in the PBAT phase were observed in the blends/composites through scanning electron microscopy. After the scCO2 treatment, the selective foaming of the PBAT phase in the prepared blends/composites was confirmed. The cellular structure of PBAT phase in scCO2-treated blends is similar to the size/shape of PBAT domains in untreated blends or treated neat PBAT foam. The addition of CNTs or CBs in the blends led to a slight reduction in cell size of the foamed PBAT phase, demonstrating CNT/CB-induced cell nucleation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed that CNTs and CBs played as nucleating agents and increased the initial crystallization temperature up to 14 °C compared with neat PBAT for PBAT in different composites during cooling. The scCO2 treatment induced the bimodal stability of PBAT crystals in different samples, which melted mainly in two temperature regions in DSC studies. Thermogravimetric analyses revealed that compared with parent blends, the addition of CNTs or CBs increased the temperature at 80 wt.% loss (degradation of PBAT portion) up to 6 °C. The electrical resistivity decreased by more than six orders of magnitude for certain CNT- or CB-added composites compared with the parent blends. The hardness of the blends slightly increased after forming the corresponding composites and then declined after the scCO2 treatment.

This study investigates the impact of CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) on the petrophysical properties and oil recovery potential of sandstone reservoirs in the oilfields located in the east-southern Precaspian region of Kazakhstan. Despite the recognized potential of CO2-EOR for improving oil recovery and aiding carbon sequestration, there is limited understanding of how CO2-EOR specifically affects the petrophysical properties of sandstone reservoirs in this region. Laboratory experiments were conducted using two core samples from the selected oilfields to examine changes in porosity, permeability, and oil recovery coefficients. The results demonstrated that porosity changes ranged from a slight increase of 1.1% to a decrease of 1.5%, while permeability reduction was significant, with decreases ranging from 29% to 50% due to clay alteration and halite precipitation. The oil recovery coefficient after CO2 flooding was found to be between 0.49 and 0.54. These findings underscore the complex interactions between CO2 and reservoir rocks, emphasizing the need for tailored EOR strategies in different geological settings.

The major challenge in the current context of a rising world’s energy demand is to limit the global temperature increase for mitigating climate change. This goal requires a large reduction of CO2 emissions, mainly produced by power generation and industrial processes using fossil fuels. In this study, a novel methodology for K2CO3-doped Li4SiO4 sorbents production for CO2 capture at high temperature was adopted based on the Design of Experiments (DoE). Different synthesis (temperature and K2CO3 content) and adsorption conditions (sorption temperature and CO2 concentration) were systematically tested by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to obtain predictive models of CO2 uptake and Li4SiO4 conversion. The results of RSM analysis evidenced a maximum adsorption capacity of 196.4 mg/g for a sorbent produced at 600 °C and with 36.9 wt% of K2CO3, tested at 500 °C and 4 vol% of CO2. Whereas at 50 vol% of CO2, the best uptake of 295.6 mg/g was obtained with a sorbent synthesized at 600 °C, containing less K2CO3 (17.1 wt%) and tested at higher temperature (662 °C). The obtained results highlight that K2CO3-doped Li4SiO4 sorbents can be tailored for maximizing CO2 capture at different operating conditions, making them suitable for use in industrial processes.

CO2 possesses several advantages, including strong solubility, effective viscosity reduction ability, and low miscible pressure, making it a promising candidate for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Additionally, due to its adsorption capture mechanism, shale formations are considered ideal environments for CO2 storage. However, the influence of heterogeneity of shale multi-scale structure on CO2 migration mechanism, EOR, and storage mechanism is not clear. In this study, a heterogeneous shale structure model containing fractures and matrix was designed based on scanning electron microscope. The multiphase–multicomponent–multirelaxation model was used to study the fluid migration mechanism in the process of miscible CO2 huff-n-puff in shale reservoir. By analyzing density variations, velocity changes, and pressure distributions, the effects of diffusion coefficient, adsorption parameters, and fracture size were studied. Furthermore, by changing the matrix structure, the influence of heterogeneity on the law of oil and gas migration was explored. Additionally, a comparison between CO2 and water was performed. Finally, the influence of reservoir heterogeneity on fluid transport mechanism was studied. The results show that EOR and CO2 storage rate (CSR) are proportional to the diffusion coefficient. The main factor affecting the CSR is the adsorption capacity of rock to CO2. The larger CO2–oil contact area between the fracture and the matrix leads to a larger CSR, highlighting the importance of induced fractures. In addition, it was found that CO2 huff-n-puff was superior to water flooding, showing an EOR performance advantage of about 15%. This study is helpful for the practical application of CO2 huff-n-puff technology in the field of unconventional oil and gas development and CO2 storage.

Methane emissions from over 7000 large-bore natural gas engines used for gas compression in the United States result from combustion inefficiency and the escape of unburned methane through the crevices. Methane is a strong greenhouse gas with a warming potential 28 times that of carbon dioxide. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Biden administration in 2022 imposes a methane “waste” fee that accumulates yearly to invest in clean energy and climate action starting in 2024. This study aims to reduce the amount of methane emissions from large bore engines through fuel injection techniques, thereby advancing sustainable energy development. The strategies explored investigate fuel injection pressure and timing optimization, crankcase methane emissions quantification and mitigation, and ring-pack methane quantification. While varying injection pressures and injection timing on the engine, the performance and methane emission characteristics were measured. Also, a model of the engine was created for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using CONVERGE Studio v 3.0. Experimental results showed that methane emissions are minimized with late-cycle fuel injection at 500 psi and 100 degrees BTDC. Computational results showed that the ring pack contributes up to 34% of methane emissions in the large bore engine model.

Chemical looping combustion (CLC) has been validated as one of the most promising technologies for fossil fuel combustion, which can produce high-purity CO2 streams ready for capture and sequestration in power production. The selection of an appropriate oxygen carrier is one of the most important issues for the CLC process, and the reduction kinetics investigation of the oxygen carrier with fuel gas can provide the basis for CLC reactor design and simulation optimization. In this study, copper ore was chosen as an oxygen carrier, and the oxygen release property of copper ore under a nitrogen environment at various temperatures (1073–1193 K) was first investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Subsequently, the reduction kinetics of copper ore with CO and H2 were evaluated by the TGA at temperatures ranging from 773 K to 1073 K, using a continuous stream of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 vol. % of CO or H2 balanced by CO2 or N2. It was found that the reaction rates of these reactions accelerated with the increase in temperature and fuel gas concentration in inlet gas. Both the oxygen release process of copper ore and the reduction process of copper ore with reducing gases can be described by the unreacted shrinking core model (USCM). The reaction mechanism function for the oxygen-releasing and reduction process of copper ore oxygen carrier was varied. The activation energy of the oxygen-releasing process, reduction process with CO, and reduction process with H2 were calculated as 99.35, 5.08, and 4.28 kJ/mol, respectively. The pre-exponential factor ranged from 1.96 × 10−1 to 1.84 × 103. The reaction order depended on the fuel gas, which was 1 and 0.86, respectively, for reaction with CO and H2.

Abstract Background The World Falls guidance includes medication review as part of its recommended multifactorial risk assessment for those at high risk of falling. Use of Falls Risk Increasing Drugs (FRIDs) along with polypharmacy and anticholinergic burden (ACB) are known to increase the risk of falls in older people. Method The impact of a community falls pharmacist within a hospital Trust, working as part of a multi-professional community falls prevention service, was evaluated in 92 people aged 65 years or older, by analysing data before and after pharmacist review, namely: number and type of FRIDs prescribed; anticholinergic burden score using ACBcalc ® ; appropriateness of medicines prescribed; bone health review using an approved too; significance of clinical intervention; cost avoidance, drug cost savings and environmental impact. Results Following pharmacist review, there was a reduction in polypharmacy (mean number of medicines prescribed per patient reduced by 8%; p < 0.05) and anticholinergic burden score (average score per patient reduced by 33%; p < 0.05). Medicines appropriateness improved (Medicines Appropriateness Index score decreased by 56%; p < 0.05). There were 317 clinically significant interventions by the community falls pharmacist. One hundred and one FRIDs were deprescribed. Annual cost avoidance and drug cost savings were £40,689-£82,642 and avoidable carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from reducing inappropriate prescribing amounted to 941 kg CO 2 . Conclusion The community falls pharmacist role increases prescribing appropriateness in the older population at risk of falls, and is an effective and cost-efficient means to optimise medicines in this population, as well as having a positive impact on the environment.

Abstract. As soil microbial respiration is the major component of land CO2 emissions, differences in the functional dependence of respiration on soil moisture among Earth system models (ESMs) contributes significantly to the uncertainties in their projections. Using soil organic C (SOC) stocks and CO2 data from a boreal forest–mire ecotone in Finland and Bayesian data assimilation, we revised the original precipitation-based monotonic saturation dependency of the Yasso07 soil carbon model using the non-monotonic Ricker function based on soil volumetric water content. We fit the revised functional dependency of moisture to the observed microbial respiration and SOC stocks and compared its performance against the original Yasso07 model and the version used in the JSBACH land surface model with a reduction constant for decomposition rates in wetlands. The Yasso07 soil C model coupled with the calibrated unimodal Ricker moisture function with an optimum in well-drained soils accurately reconstructed observed SOC stocks and soil CO2 emissions and clearly outperformed previous model versions on paludified organo-mineral soils in forested peatlands and water-saturated organic soils in mires. The best estimate of the posterior moisture response of decomposition used both measurements of SOC stocks and CO2 data from the full range of moisture conditions (from dry and xeric to wet and water-saturated soils). We observed unbiased residuals of SOC and CO2 data modelled with the moisture optimum in well-drained soils, suggesting that this modified function accounts more precisely for the long-term SOC change dependency according to ecosystem properties as well as the contribution of short-term CO2 responses including extreme events. The optimum moisture for decomposition in boreal forests was found in well-drained soils instead of the mid-range between dry and water-saturated conditions as is commonly assumed among soil C and ESMs. Although the unimodal moisture modifier with an optimum in well-drained soils implicitly incorporates robust biogeochemical mechanisms of SOC accumulation and CO2 emissions, it needs further evaluation with large-scale data to determine if its use in land surface models will decrease the uncertainty in projections.

The transportation sector is responsible for about 16% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Despite efforts for a sensible reduction by means of new technologies’ development, the average age of a vehicle fleet is 12.3 years in the European Union. In light of this, actions aiming at improving the efficiency of circulating vehicles can prove effective in the short to mid-term. Introducing performance packages in standard fuels could allow a reduction in the CO2 emissions of whole vehicle fleets without any modification to powertrain. Such a kind of additive is generally used in premium fuels; deposit control additives can reduce or control the deposits at intake valves and at nozzle holes with benefits for the fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions. Further improvements in combustion phasing can be achieved with cetane/octane improver. This paper aims to assess the influence of two performance packages on the exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of five vehicles set to be as representative as possible of circulating Italian passenger cars and light commercial fleet vehicles (LCVs). Based on the literature datasets, three Euro 4 vehicles were selected with a mileage representative of each single vehicle class: two passenger cars (one spark ignition and one diesel) and an LCV. Further, two diesel Euro 6 vehicles, a passenger car and an LCV, were tested to investigate the effect of fuel additives on the combustion of vehicles compliant with current homologation regulation. Exhaust emissions and fuel consumption were experimentally estimated on a chassis dynamometer over a worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC) in a climate-controlled laboratory. Each vehicle was preliminarily tested when running with base fuel, then a 3000 km clean-up stage was performed using the additive package. Finally, WLTC tests were repeated. Results demonstrated the efficiency of the performance packages with a reduction between 1.2% (diesel Euro 6 passenger car) and 8.1% (diesel Euro 4 passenger car) in fuel consumption. Similar trends were found for CO2 emissions. Further, a sensible reduction in THCs, CO and PM was found for each vehicle class.

The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu‐based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO‐to‐C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single‐atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd‐Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd‐atop (PdL) and Pd‐Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C−C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO‐to‐C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37% at ‒0.83 V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non‐Cu electrocatalytic CO‐to‐C2 conversion capability.

This study evaluates the efficiency of biodegradable polyurethane foams as thermal insulation materials compared to conventional materials like expanded polystyrene (EPS). Key parameters analyzed include thermal conductivity, energy savings, CO2 emission reductions, and investment payback periods. Biodegradable polyurethane foams demonstrated a thermal conductivity of 0.022 W/(m·K), significantly lower than EPS&#039;s 0.035 W/(m·K), leading to higher energy savings. Calculations reveal an annual energy saving of 443,820 kWh for polyurethane foams, compared to 441,330 kWh for EPS. Financially, polyurethane foams save approximately €53,258.4 annually, while EPS saves €52,959.6. In terms of environmental impact, polyurethane foams reduce CO2 emissions by 88,764 kg annually, versus 88,266 kg for EPS. Despite the higher initial cost of polyurethane foams (€50/m² compared to €30/m² for EPS), the payback period is remarkably short at 0.094 years (1.13 months) compared to EPS&#039;s 0.057 years (0.68 months). These findings highlight biodegradable polyurethane foams as a superior option for thermal insulation, offering significant energy, financial, and environmental benefits.

The construction sector is of critical importance for economic growth and employment creation. However, it also has significant environmental impacts, including high energy consumption, extensive use of natural resources, and substantial waste production. Currently, the construction sector in Turkey accounts for 35% of the country’s total energy consumption, making it a significant energy consumer. Research conducted in European Union countries indicates that buildings are responsible for 40% of total energy consumption and 36% of total CO2 emissions. It is believed that a similar situation exists in Turkey. Furthermore, the long lifespan of structures built in the sector is of great importance for sustainability. The contribution of poor-quality and unhealthy structures to environmental stress further highlights the role of the construction sector in sustainability. The study addresses the impacts of strategic goals such as the design and construction of sustainable building models, the recyclability and reuse of building materials, energy efficiency, and the reduction of CO2 emissions on the construction sector. The findings indicate that the integration of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies is crucial for the Turkish construction sector to move towards a sustainable future. In this context, it is recommended that the Turkish construction sector implement the necessary steps and engage in strategic planning in order to achieve its sustainability goals. The findings of the study emphasise the pivotal role and significance of the construction sector in this regard.

The increasing concerns about CO2 emissions and climate change have pointed out the urgency of promoting sustainability in the building sector. One promising solution to enhance the energy efficiency of buildings and diminish environmental impact is the integration of phase-change materials (PCMs) into ventilated façade systems. This review article critically examines the current state of research on this innovative approach, with a particular focus on fire safety considerations. The paper explores the integration of PCM into ventilated façades, highlighting the potential for significant improvements in energy consumption, thermal comfort, and reductions in CO2 emissions. However, the flammability of PCMs introduces substantial fire safety challenges that must be addressed to ensure the safe application of this solution. The fire safety of both ventilated façades and PCMs is approached, followed by specific fire safety concerns when PCMs are integrated into ventilated façade systems. The conclusion states that while the integration of PCMs into ventilated façades offers substantial environmental benefits, attention to fire safety is essential. This necessitates the implementation of rigorous fire protection measures during the design and construction phases. By addressing both the environmental advantages and fire safety challenges, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential and limitations of PCM-integrated ventilated façades, offering valuable insights for researchers, engineers, and policymakers in the field of sustainable buildings.

Abstract Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration has been steadily increasing since the 19th century, causing global warming. Despite efforts to reduce emissions, current projections anticipate a significant increase in global mean temperature by the end of the century, which may push us beyond a safe and just operating space. We must develop emissions pathways that take into account renewable technology innovation, climate policy development and consumer behavior change. In this manuscript we assess corporate emissions reduction ambition in the context of reduction pathways, and in doing so show that company reporting has reached a scale and quality that it can be used to supplement global emissions forecasting. We find emissions disclosures of target-setting companies to account for roughly a fifth of global CO2 emissions and three-fifths of total market capitalisation. Of these, we find near-term targets to be consistent with the aggressive reduction requirements of the divergent net-zero scenario published by the Network for Greening the Financial System, but commitments to 2050 are lacking. There is a large disparity between the total market capitalisation of disclosing companies and the total emissions they cover, a disconnect which we emphasise must be addressed by future

Carbon farming is considered as one of the mitigation options to reach the targets of the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal.The purpose of this report is to assess which carbon farming schemes are available throughout Europe, how they can be characterised and to which extent they deal with principles like additionality, fairness and long-term carbon storage, besides the issues of a proper MRV(monitoring, reporting and verification)-system with acceptable costs and sufficient payments for the farmers.The way in which carbon farming is organised is very different depending on the type of scheme.In this report, a carbon farming scheme is defined as any voluntary agreement in which a farmer or a group of farmers commit themselves to apply carbon farming measures to get a positive balance between soil carbon accumulation and GHG emissions (possibly measured as CO2 equivalents) or reduction of GHG-emissions in return for a payment or compensation in any form.

Self-leveling mortars are a product that stands out in the market for optimizing production. Greater speed of application is achieved due to its high fluidity, and the ability to level without segregation. This paper approaches self-leveling mortars formulated with different types of cement and additions and evaluates these material’s effect on the rheological behavior, physical–mechanical characteristics, and environmental aspects of this type of mortar. The results indicate that rheological aspects can be achieved regardless of the type of cement and addition. With proper proportioning, the normative requirements in terms of mechanical properties are met. When using lower-fineness cement, the risk of cracking and the demand for water and chemicals increases. Mineral additions contributed to the mortars’ cohesion and reduced shrinkage in mixtures with contents of up to 25% metakaolin and 15% silica fume. Regarding the decarbonization process, opting for cement with pozzolanic additions becomes a favorable solution as it presents a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 170 kg per m3 of mortar produced.

The economic viability of a photovoltaic (PV) installation depends on regulations regarding administrative, technical and economic conditions associated with self-consumption and the sale of surplus production. Royal Decree (RD) 244/2019 is the Spanish legislation of reference for this case study, in which we analyse and compare PV installation offers by key suppliers. The proposals are not optimal in RD 244/2019 terms and appear not to fully contemplate power generation losses and seem to shift a representative percentage of consumption to the production period. In our case study of a residential dwelling, the best option corresponds to a 5 kWp installation with surplus sale to the market, with a payback period of 18 years and CO2 emission reductions of 1026 kg/year. Demand-side management offers a potential improvement of 6%–21.8%. Based on the increase in electricity prices since 2020, the best option offers savings of up to €1507.74 and amortization in 4.24 years. Considering costs and savings, sale to the market could be considered as the only feasible regulatory mechanism for managing surpluses, accompanied by measures to facilitate administrative procedures and guarantees for end users.

Abstract. In light of the necessity to meet growing energy demands while minimising expenses, this article examines two solar power system designs, considering peak and average load situations. The peak system, designed to handle a peak load of 190 MW with 260,568 PV panels installed, generates a significant excess of approximately 49,911 MWh annually. On the other hand, the average load design suggests a little deficit in energy. The monetary analysis reveals considerable capital expenditures for the total installation costs, totalling $58.77 million for an average system and $66.71 million for the peak system. However, the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) rates are relatively competitive, at 0.0835 USD/kWh and 0.0736 USD/kWh respectively. Notably, the study highlights that the environmental impact analysis demonstrates a significant decrease in CO2 emissions, with the peak system achieving a reduction of up to 3,601,588 tonnes per year. This research has explicitly validated the capabilities of centralised solar power systems in addressing the current and future energy difficulties faced by the Government of Sindh in a sustainable and economically viable manner.

Abstract Sustainable design principles have become increasingly important in website development, mainly focusing on reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption. Easy language (EL) is a simplified language variety that makes websites more accessible to a wider range of users; but there has been no attention given to its usefulness in sustainability efforts. As such, this study is intended to become a starting point for future research in the area. By examining the intersection between EL and website sustainability guidelines and practices, the study highlights the potential for EL to contribute to sustainable website design. Along the paper, the following theory is defended: when adapted to Easy Language, text and interactions in websites are simplified, which makes them require less data transfer, become more efficient and, ultimately, more sustainable. The paper also presents a small comparative analysis of the sustainability of websites in EL and standard language that indicated that EL generally enhanced the sustainability of websites. The nine websites in EL analysed showed a mean reduction of CO2 production of 42% in comparison to their equivalents in standard language ( p = 0.049, F = 2.42). The discussion and results presented open potential solutions for an urgent problem that deserve to be considered and researched further.

Inventory management is crucial for companies to minimize unnecessary costs associated with overstocking or understocking items. Utilizing the economic order quantity (EOQ) to minimize total costs is a key decision in inventory management, particularly in achieving a sustainable supply chain. The classical EOQ formula is rarely applicable in practice. For example, suppliers may enforce a minimum order quantity (MOQ) that is much larger than the EOQ. Some conditions such as imperfect quality and growing items represent variants of EOQ. Moreover, some requirements, such as the reduction of CO2 emissions, can alter the formula. Moreover, disruptions in the supply chain, such as COVID-19, can affect the formula. This study investigates which requirements must be considered during the calculation of the EOQ. Based on a literature review, 18 requirements that could alter the EOQ formula were identified. The level of coverage for these requirements has been tracked in the literature. Research gaps were presented to be investigated in future research. The analysis revealed that, despite their importance, at least 11 requirements have seldom been explored in the literature. Among these, topics such as EOQ in Industry 4.0, practical EOQ, and resilient EOQ have been identified as promising areas for future research.

The climate crisis, driven by increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere, has heightened the need for new, environmentally friendly energy sources. Hydrogen gas, which can meet our energy needs, has become a particularly intriguing topic. This study investigated the partial oxidation reaction of methane with cordierite monolith catalysts. The Ni-coated catalysts were supported with γ-Al2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, and CeO2-ZrO2. The catalysts were tested at temperatures of 750, 800, and 850 °C with different flow rates and methane feed concentrations (2%, 5%, and 10%). It was demonstrated that catalyst activity varies depending on these parameters. It has been found that high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and CH4 feed rates decrease catalyst activity. The obtained reaction results indicated that the optimal reaction parameters were 800 °C, a GHSV of 1.104 h−1, and a CH4 feed concentration of 2%. By optimizing these parameters, catalysts with high CH4 conversion and selectivity for H2 and CO were achieved. The prepared catalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR).

Urban road traffic is one of the primary sources of carbon emissions. Previous studies have demonstrated the close relationship between traffic flow characteristics and carbon emissions (CO2). However, the impact of dynamic traffic distribution on carbon emissions is rarely empirically studied on the network level. To fill this gap, this study proposes a dynamic network carbon emissions estimation method. The network-level traffic emissions are estimated by combining macroscopic emission models and recent advances in dynamic network traffic flow modeling, namely, Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram. The impact of traffic distribution and the penetration of battery electric vehicles on total network emissions are further investigated using the Monte Carlo method. The results indicate the substantial effect of network traffic distribution on carbon emissions. Using the urban expressway network in Ningbo as an example, in the scenario of 100% internal combustion engine vehicles, increasing the standard deviation of link-level traffic density from 0 to 15 veh/km-ln can result in an 8.9% network capacity drop and a 15.5% reduction in network carbon emissions. This effect can be moderated as the penetration rate of battery electric vehicles increases. Based on the empirical and simulating evidence, different expressway pollution management strategies can be implemented, such as petrol vehicle restrictions, ramp metering, congestion pricing, and perimeter control strategies.

Using predicted potential N mineralization (PNM) from its relationship with CO2 flush at 1 d incubation (CF) of soil samples in recommended N rates can reduce N fertilization rates for crops. This study used predicted PNM at the 0–15 cm depth to reduce N fertilization rates and examined spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields at two sites (Froid and Sidney) in Montana, USA. Cropping sequences at Froid were fall and spring till continuous spring wheat (FSTCW), no-till continuous spring wheat (NTCW1), no-till spring wheat–pea (Pisum sativum L.) (NTWP1), and spring till spring wheat–fallow (STWF). At Sidney, cropping sequences were conventional till spring wheat–fallow (CTWF), no-till spring wheat–fallow (NTWF), no-till continuous spring wheat (NTCW2), and no-till spring wheat–pea (NTWP2). Soil samples collected to a depth of 15 cm in September 2021 at both sites were analyzed for CF, PNM, and NO3-N contents, from which the reduction in N fertilization rate (RNFA) and the amount of N fertilizer applied (ANFA) to 2022 spring wheat were determined. In April 2022, spring wheat was grown with or without predicted PNM and annualized crop yields were compared. The CF and PNM were 114–137% greater for NTWP1 than STWF at Froid and 26–80% greater for NTCW2 than CTWF and NTWF at Sidney. The reduction in N fertilization rate was 26–102% greater for NTWP1 at Froid and 8–10% greater for NTCW2 and NTWF than other cropping sequences at Sidney. Annualized crop yield was 26–60% lower for crop–fallow than continuous cropping, but was not significantly different between with or without PNM at both sites. Using PNM can significantly reduce N fertilization rates for crops while sustaining dryland yields.

The practical application of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is hindered by the competing CO production, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the lack of pH‐universal catalysts. Here, Te‐modified Bi nanorods (Te‐Bi NRs) were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. Our study illustrates that the complex reconstruction process of Bi2Te4O11 NRs during CO2RR could be decoupled into three distinct steps, i.e., the destruction of Bi2Te4O11, the formation of Te/Bi phases, and the dissolution of Te. The thus‐obtained Te‐Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate production, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline). In a flow cell reactor under neutral, alkaline, or acidic conditions, the catalysts achieved HCOOH Faradaic efficiencies of up to 94.3%, 96.4%, and 91.0%, respectively, at a high current density of 300 mA cm‐2. DFT calculations, along with operando spectral measurements, reveal that Te manipulates the Bi sites to an electron‐deficient state, enhancing the adsorption strength of the *OCHO intermediate, and significantly suppressing the competing HER and CO production. This study highlights the substantial influence of catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions and offers insights into designing highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

## Understanding the Social Determinants of Household Carbon Emissions for Carbon Mitigation Policies: The Case of Mersin, Turkey

Households are the main consumer-side source of carbon emissions. In Europe, consumer-based CO2 consumption per capita fell from 10.8 tons to 7.8 tons between 1990 and 2022, but in Turkey, the same data showed a rise from 4 tons to 5 tons. Strategies to reduce carbon emissions have recently shifted their focus from the production side to the consumption side. However, because different social segments have varying levels of price sensitivity and differing levels of necessity regarding consuming different items, a simple tax policy only targeting the consumption side is doomed to fail. This has prompted a discussion of the factors influencing carbon emissions on the consumption side and how those factors affect the amount of emissions. This study aims to identify the social determinants affecting household carbon emission levels and to demonstrate that such differences play an important role in effective and efficient carbon emission reduction strategies. In this case study, an appropriate testing method was used to test whether there are significant differences in dependent variables (carbon emissions) between categories of independent variables (the social determinants of households). As our literature review demonstrates, the social determinants of households and the local context were found to have an impact on carbon emissions in the case study. Nevertheless, we found that the degree of association lessens when the relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables is re-evaluated while controlling for income level. Consequently, it may be concluded that the primary element influencing carbon emissions is income. In our field study, on the other hand, poverty stood out as another important factor affecting the level of carbon emissions. Poverty affects total household carbon emissions in two different ways, causing both carbon-intensive consumer goods and household appliances with low energy efficiency to be preferred because they are cheap to purchase. Therefore, the fight against poverty should be recognized as an important component of carbon reduction policies in Turkey, and the issue of environmental justice should not be ignored, because we know that 30% of the population was living in poverty (compared to the other 70% receiving the national median income) in 2022.

Emissions from transportation are one of the key factors preventing the achievement of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality by 2050, with particular attention to emissions from buses. Specifically, few research has been conducted on the exhaust emissions characteristics of liquified natural gas (LNG) buses under different driving scenarios. This study proposed a framework for predicting exhaust emissions of LNG buses based on the portable emission measurement system and GPS collaborative perception data. Firstly, the emission distribution characteristics of CO2, CO, HC, and NOx from LNG buses in real-world driving were analyzed by visualization methods. Then, the real-time exhaust emissions of LNG buses were predicted based on the temporal fusion transformers model for both urban and suburban sections of Zhenjiang City, and the model validity was verified. The current and past 10 s driving states were used for predicting the emission rate of LNG buses. The results showed that the proposed model outperforms other advanced algorithms in real-time exhaust emissions prediction of LNG buses, with an average R2 value higher than 0.94 and an average MAPE reduction of 14.19%. The error assessment revealed that the emission values and average emission rates are higher when driving in the urban section compared to the suburban section. Among the influencing factors, traffic conditions have the most significant impacts on the exhaust emissions of LNG buses, followed by road conditions and driving states, with relative feature importance of 48.9, 34.8, and 16.3%, respectively. Additionally, the current and past 10 s driving states also significantly influenced real-time predictions. This study provides an essential theoretical reference for reducing exhaust emissions for city buses.

Presently, it is imperative to address global environmental challenges. The concerns are related to the depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels, greenhouse gases, and pollutant emissions. The transportation sector contributes significantly to these issues. In particular, the aviation industry primarily relies on jet fuel, a fossil fuel responsible for around 2% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. As a result, to address contemporary society environmental concerns and energy requirements, promising renewable and green energy sources are being intensively investigated, especially in air transportation. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), particularly biofuels, have been explored and indicated as a short-term solution to address the energy transition in the aviation sector. Implementing alternative fuels requires a deeper investigation regarding the spray dynamics. Following this, the present study explores conventional (Jet A-1) and alternative jet fuel (HVO) atomization, and the breakup length is explored in a wide range of operating conditions. The normalized mean breakup length was measured, and a correlation was proposed based on the experimental data. Additionally, the droplets released by the jet breakup are compared for both fuels in terms of diameter. Observations reveal the occurrence of jet flapping and bag breakup, affected by the air flowrate. The results also show that regardless of the fuel, increasing the momentum flux leads to a reduction in the normalized mean breakup length. An increase in the air flowrate promotes a shorter breakup length, resulting in a secondary droplet with smaller secondary droplet diameters. An empirical correlation was developed based on the fitting of the experimental data. This correlation indicates that the normalized mean breakup length exhibits a power law relation with M, which is consistent with the literature. This experimental study is essential to research on biofuels and aids in the development of new injectors and the precision of theoretical models integrated into numerical algorithms.

Electrocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and CO2 reduction reaction that are pivotal for the energy transition, are multi-step processes that occur in a nanoscale electric double layer (EDL) at a solid-liquid interface. Conventional analyses based on the Sabatier principle, using binding energies or effective electronic structure properties such as the d-band center as descriptors, are able to grasp overall trends in catalytic activity in specific groups of catalysts. However, thermodynamic approaches often fail to account for a plethora of electrolyte effects that arise in the EDL, including pH, cation, and anion effects. These effects have been observed to exert strong impacts on electrocatalytic reactions. There is growing consensus that the local reaction environment (LRE) prevailing in the EDL is the key to deciphering these complex and hitherto perplexing electrolyte effects. Increasing attention is thus paid to designing appropriate electrolytes, positioning the LRE at center stage. To this end, unraveling the LRE is becoming essential for designing electrocatalysts with specifically tailored properties, which could enable much needed breakthroughs in electrochemical energy science. Theory and modeling are getting more and more important and powerful in addressing this multifaceted problem that involves physical phenomena at different scales and interacting in a multidimensional parametric space. Theoretical models developed for this purpose should treat intrinsic multistep kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions, EDL effects from sub-nm scale to the scale of 10 nm, and mass transport phenomena bridging scales from < 0.1 to 100 μm. Given the diverse physical phenomena and scales involved, it is evident that the challenge at hand surpasses the capabilities of any single theoretical or computational approach. In this Account, we present a hierarchical theoretical framework to address the above challenge. It seamlessly integrates several modules: (i) microkinetic modelling that accounts for various reaction pathways; (ii) an LRE model that describes the interfacial region extending from the nanometric EDL continuously to the solution bulk; (iii) first-principles calculations that provide parameters, e.g., adsorption energies, activation barriers and EDL parameters. The microkinetic model considers all elementary steps without designating an a priori rate-determining step. The kinetics of these elementary steps are expressed in terms of local concentrations, potential and electric field that are co-determined by EDL charging and mass transport in the LRE model. Vital insights on electrode kinetic phenomena, i.e., potential-dependent Tafel slopes, cation effects, and pH effects, obtained from this hierarchical framework are then reviewed. Finally, an outlook on further improvement of the model framework is presented, in view of recent developments in first-principles based simulation of electrocatalysis, observations of dynamic reconstruction of catalysts, and machine-learning assisted computational simulations.
