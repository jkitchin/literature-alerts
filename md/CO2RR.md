Continuous-flow methodologies offer promising avenues for sustainable processing due to their precise process control, scalability, and efficient heat and mass transfer. The small dimensions of continuous-flow reactors render them highly suitable for light-assisted reactions, as can be encountered in carbon dioxide hydrogenations. In this study, we present a novel reactor system emphasizing reproducibility, modularity, and automation, facilitating streamlined screening of conditions and catalysts for these processes. Through meticulous control over temperature, light intensity, pressure, residence time, and reagent stoichiometry, we conducted hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, yielding selective formation of carbon monoxide and methane using heterogeneous catalysts, including a newly developed ruthenium nanoparticle on titania catalyst. Furthermore, we demonstrated the direct utilization of on-demand generated carbon monoxide in the production of fine chemicals via various carbonylative cross-coupling reactions.

Since the mid-19th century, there has been a steady increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, leading to global warming due to the greenhouse effect. CO2 can be utilized to obtain a large number of organic compounds. The formation of these compounds depends on the methods of CO2 processing, which include biological, thermal conversion, photochemical, and plasma methods. Most of these methods involve the use of catalysts. One of the plasma methods is the electron-catalytic method using a barrier discharge. Studies on the catalytic conversion of CO2 into methanol and formaldehyde were carried out on a laboratory setup consisting of two sources of low-temperature plasma – dischargers, one of which contains a heterogeneous catalyst. Water vapor was used as the source of hydrogen. The formation of methanol and formaldehyde was investigated under different operating modes of the setup. The effect of sample aging for a day was determined. As a result, there is an increase in the concentration of methanol in the sample from 5.8% to 49.74% and formaldehyde from 4.1% to 50.01% for different operating modes of the setup. The observed results are explained by a sharp increase in the yield of oxygen-containing radicals and , which are formed by the interaction of ozone, formed from CO2 in the discharge zone, with aqueous solutions.

This study focused on preparation of stable polymer films of NiII‐ and CoII‐tetraaminophthalocyanines, p‐NiTAPc and p‐CoTAPc, respectively, for highly efficient heterogeneous electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction in a flow electrolysis cell. Major development represented in this work was fabrication of p‐NiTAPc and p‐CoTAPc films via electropolymerization of their corresponding monomers on carbon‐based substrates without using binder or conducting additive materials to obtain efficient gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for scalable, productive and selective CO2‐to‐CO conversion. The target polymers were characterized by UV‐visible spectrophotometry, attenuated total reflection‐Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. According to controlled potential electrolysis and gas chromatography, p‐NiTAPc‐catalyzed CO2 reduction at –0.99V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) gave 953 mL of CO in a period of 16 hours with current density and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 109±1 mA·cm‐2 and 99±2%, respectively. A p‐CoTAPc‐modified GDE exhibited superior catalytic performance to the case of p‐NiTAPc in terms of catalyst stability and CO productivity by performing the continuous CO2 reduction at the potential of –1.10 V vs. RHE for up to 41 hours and affording almost 3 times higher amount of CO with the current density of 161±5 mA/cm2 and 95±2% FE.

The urgency to mitigate environmental impacts from anthropogenic CO2 emissions has propelled extensive research efforts on CO2 reduction. The current work reports a novel approach involving transforming CO2 and ethane into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using earth‐abundant metals (Fe, Co, Ni) at 750 °C. This route facilitates long‐term carbon storage via generating high‐value CNTs and produces valuable syngas with adjustable H2/CO ratios as byproducts. Without CO2, direct pyrolysis of ethane undergoes rapid deactivation. The participation of CO2 not only enhances the durability of the catalyst, but also contributes about 30% of the CNTs production, presenting a viable solution to CO2 challenges. The CNT morphology depends on the catalyst used. Co‐ and Ni‐based catalysts produce CNT with a 20 nm diameter and micrometer length, whereas Fe‐based catalysts yield bamboo‐like structures. This work represents a pioneering effort in utilizing CO2 and ethane for CNT production with potential environmental and economic benefits.

The growing worldwide dependence on fossil fuels and the subsequent release of CO2 emissions pose substantial environmental challenges. The purpose of this review is to examine the process of electrochemical carbon reduction (ECR) and specifically investigate the use of copper-based electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 into chemically valuable substances. The synthetic methods employed for these catalysts are analyzed, along with their impact on product selectivity and the potential advantages they present. The focus of our research lies in the exploration of alloy electrocatalysts, specifically those composed of Cu-Au, Cu-Pd, and CuNi combinations. These particular combinations have demonstrated improved efficiency and selectivity in the reduction of CO2. This paper aims to assist in the design of high-performance copper catalysts and the optimization of ECR processes by providing insights into the structure–function relationships and intermediate modulation.

The consumption of fossil fuels releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, causing a serious greenhouse effect. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2 to chemical fuels is an effective way to alleviate the current energy and environmental crisis. However, it is still difficult to rationally design efficient PEC CO2 reduction photocathodes. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a promising photocathode material, but its surface is susceptible to the accumulation of photogenerated electrons leading to corrosion and activity reduction, and is accompanied by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), both of which lead to the overall low conversion efficiency of CO2 reduction by Cu2O. In this study, the PEC CO2 conversion efficiency was improved by the synergistic effect of the C electron transport layer to accelerate the electron transfer to alleviate the Cu2O corrosion problem and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hydrophobic layer to inhibit the HER. The test showed that the CO yield of Cu2O/C/PTFE at the optimum potential (‐0.7 V vs. RHE) was 54.6μmol cm‐2 h‐1, which was 3.2 times higher than that of pure Cu2O. This study provides a facile strategy for constructing an efficient photocathode with great potential for CO reduction.

This short review analyzes CO2 reduction within microfluidic platforms, thoroughly investigating existing methodologies, challenges, and novel perspectives. This work commences with a detailed exposition of the fundamental principles governing microfluidic electrolyzers, elucidating the interaction of microchannels and electrodes. We show the electrochemical reactions supporting CO2 reduction, detailing the processes at the cathode. The use of microfluidic systems encompasses precise control over reaction conditions, efficient mass transport, reduced energy consumption, high throughput screening capabilities, integration with analytical tools, and portability. Catalyst selection for optimal CO2 reduction products, technical complexities, integration of renewable energy sources, and cost‐effectiveness are notable challenges on the horizon. A perspective on potential pathways to resolution is delineated, with each impediment succinctly but insightfully addressed. Moreover, this review extends beyond a looking‐back analysis, propounding innovative perspectives. It posits the concept of microfluidic fuel cells directly fueled by CO2.

Electrochemical CO2 reducAon reacAon (eCO2RR) offers a pathway to produce valuable chemical fuels from CO2. However, its efficiency in aqueous electrolytes is hindered by the concurrent H2 evolution reaction (HER), which takes place at similar potentials. While the influence of cations on this process has been extensively studied, the influence of anions remains largely unexplored. In this work we study how eCO2RR selectivity and activity on a gold catalyst are affected by wide range or inorganic and carboxilate anions. We utilize in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) for real-time product monitoring, coupled with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show, that anions significantly impact eCO2RR kinetics and eCO2RR selectivity. MD simulations reveal a new descriptor – free energy of anion physisorption – where weakly adsorbing anions enable favourable CO2 reduction kinetics. By leveraging these fundamental insights, we identify propionate as the most promising anion, achieving nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency while showing high CO production rates that are comparable to those in bicarbonate. These insights underscore the vital role of anion selection in achieving highly efficient eCO2RR in aqueous electrolytes.

For achieving CO2 thermal reduction, a technology combining solid carbon activation and high-temperature CO2 reduction was proposed, named as activated-reduction technology. In this study, this technology is realized by using a circulating fluidized bed and downdraft reactor. Reduced agent parameters (O2/C and CO2 concentration) greatly affect the reduction effect of CO2. In addition, the effect of the activation process on different carbon-based materials can help to broaden the range of carbon-based materials used for CO2 reduction, which is also an important issue. The following three points have been studied through experiments: (1) the influence of the characteristics of the reduced agent (CO2 concentration and O2/C) on CO2 reduction; (2) the performance of different chars in CO2 reduction; and (3) the activation effect of solid carbon. The activation process can develop the pore structure of coal gasification char and transform it into activated char with higher reactivity. The CO concentration in the tail gas is a crucial factor limiting the effectiveness of CO2 reduction, with an experimentally determined upper limit of around 55% at 1200 °C. If CO concentration is far from the upper limit, temperature becomes the significant influencing factor. When the reduced agent O2/C is 0.18, the highest net CO2 reduction of 0.021 Nm3/kg is achieved at 60% CO2 concentration. When the reduced agent CO2 concentration is 50%, the highest net CO2 reduction of 0.065 Nm3/kg is achieved at 0.22 O2/C. Compared with CPGC, YHGC has higher reactivity and is more suitable for CO2 reduction. The activation process helps to reduce the differences between raw materials.

This study introduces an innovative approach to enhance cathodic CO2 reduction on the working side by focusing on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the counter side. Maintaining an inert atmosphere on the counter side led to a significant improvement in CO faradaic efficiency from 65% to 95%. BiVO4 on FTO proved to be resistant to oxygen poisoning when used as photoanode. Additionally, investigations into the stability of [AgSePh]∞ reveal insights into its behaviour under elevated potential and surrounding electrolyte, suggesting weakening Ag-Se bonds and the release of benzeneselenol upon charge accumulation within the first 2 hours before producing CO in a stable manner for 16 hours. Overall, this research significantly contributes to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, offering innovative pathways for catalyst development and optimization.

A modified Metal‐Organic Framework UiO‐66‐NH2–based photocathode in a zero‐gap gas phase photoelectrolyzer was applied for CO2 reduction. Four types of porous carbon fiber layers with different wettability were employed to tailor the local environment of the cathodic surface reactions, optimizing activity and selectivity towards formate, methanol, and ethanol. Results are explained by mass transport through the different type and arrangement of carbon fiber support layers in the photocathodes and the resulting local environment at the UiO‐66‐NH2 catalyst. The highest energy‐to‐fuel conversion efficiency of 1.06% towards hydrocarbons was achieved with the most hydrophobic carbon fiber (H23C2). The results are a step further in understanding how the design and composition of the electrodes in photoelectrochemical electrolyzers can impact the CO2 reduction efficiency and selectivity.

The development of high-efficiency catalysts plays a crucial role in advancing CO2 electroreduction techniques. Among potential candidate, diamond-based electrocatalysts show promise due to their broad electrochemical windows, which effectively suppress competitive hydrogen evolution and ensure high CO2 reduction efficiency. In this study, we report an integrated electrode composed of oxygen-terminated diamond nanocone (ODcone) with CoPc-molecules anchoring (CoPc/ODcone). The CoPc/ODcone electrodes exhibited remarkable performance, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.1% for CO at −0.97 V vs. RHE, and maintaining an FECO higher than 80% over a wide potential range of −0.67 V to −1.07 V vs. RHE. The outstanding performance of the CoPc/ODcone electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effects between the nanostructured diamond surface and the CoPc catalyst. The hydroxyl-rich nature of the diamond surface facilitates the anchoring of CoPc molecules and bonding with Co atoms in CoPc. Simultaneously, the nanostructured diamond with sharp tips enhances CO2 adsorption, thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This study provides valuable insights into the utilization of non-metallic carbon materials, particularly diamond, as metal-free catalysts in CO2 electrochemical reduction and tackles challenges such as low current density and poor FE, thus contributing to the advancement of more effective catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.

Electrochemical conversion of CO2 and H2O to value-added products is an attractive approach for sustainable chemical production. Significant progress has been made in the past few decades in improving activity and selectivity, advancing this technology to practical application. Considering the next step for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, improving carbon utilisation efficiency, stability, and energy efficiency are essential. Bipolar membrane (BPM)-based electrolysers, which allow electrodes to be operated under different pH, are advantageous to tackle the challenge mentioned above. Herein, we introduced the current status of CO2 electrolysers, followed by configuration, challenges, progress and outlook for combining reverse-bias BPM with different types of electrolysers. Our aim is to provide insight into developing carbon-efficient and energy-efficient CO2RR systems towards practical application.

Using low-carbon/zero-carbon energy sources and negative emission technologies, and economic policies have proven to be effective measures for electric power plants' CO2 emission mitigation. This study constructs an interval fractional electric power system planning (IFES) model for minimizing CO2 emission intensity considering the interactions between the measures and other constraints under uncertainty. The model is applied to Fujian Province as a real-case study, which contains electricity mix improvement, three types of CO2 emission reduction technologies, one policy. It was found that: (i) System carbon emission intensity is [170, 213] g/RMB; (ii) The proportion of clean energy power generation in Fujian Province will reach [92.32, 93.13]% in the 2055–2060, with nuclear energy, wind power and photovoltaic power generation ranking the top three; (iii) The electricity mix improvement has made the greatest contribution to the carbon neutrality of the power system (74.62%), and the contributions of CCS, DAC, and ESC are (9.11, 5.25, 11.02%) respectively. The research results provide scientific planning solutions for carbon reduction in the power industry in Fujian Province. The developed IF-ESP model can also be used in other regions around the world.

With high atomic utilization and remarkable catalytic activity, Cu-N-C type catalysts display great potential for electro-catalysis in CO2 reduction. However, the relationship between the active moiety and catalytic activity of generating high-value C2 products is still unclear, and the explicit screening criteria is scarcity. Herein, based on the first-principle simulation, the structure-performance relationship on Cu-N-C type catalysts has been investigated by modulating the CO2 reduction process as the number of Cu atom (Cu1, Cu2, Cu3) and the ligand environment (B, C, N, O, P, S) changed. We find the adsorption strength of intermediate *CO strongly affect the possibility of C-C coupling, which can be determined by Bader charge on Cu atom, mainly depending on the number of loaded atomic Cu on Cu-N-C catalysts. Furthermore, the Bader charge can be refined by adjusting the coordination atom of Cu, thus optimizing catalytic activity for the CO2 to ethanol. The moderate Bader charge value, between +0.35 and +0.45, enables the catalyst to behave as a potentially excellent activity with low limiting potential for generating ethanol. More importantly, an intrinsic descriptor, composed of the radius, electronegativity, and number of valence electrons of coordination atoms (φ=∑χ∑r⁎∑np), was established to characterize the catalytic activity of Cu-N(X)-C catalysts for producing ethanol. Two excellent catalysts, Cu3-N2O2 (-0.51 V) and Cu3-N3S (-0.64 V), are screened out for the CO2RR to generate ethanol. This work discloses theoretical basis for catalytic selectivity of C2 products on Cu-N-C catalysts and provides a regulating and screening principle for high performance catalysts to ethanol.

Abstract Advanced photocatalysts are highly desired to activate the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with low concentration. Herein, the NiSn(OH)6 with rich surface lattice hydroxyls was synthesized to boost the activity directly under the natural air. Results showed that terminal Ni-OH could serve as donors to feed protons and generate oxygen vacancies (VO), thus beneficial to convert the activated CO2 (HCO3-) mainly into CO (5.60 μmol/g) in the atmosphere. It was flexible and widely applicable for a stable CO2RR from high pure to air level free of additionally adding H2O reactant, and higher than the traditional gas-liquid-solid (1.58 μmol/g) and gas-solid (4.07 μmol/g) reaction system both using high pure CO2 and plenty of H2O. The strong hydrophilia by the rich surface hydroxyls allowed robust H2O molecule adsorption and dissociation at VO sites to achieve the Ni-OH regeneration, leading to a stable CO yield (11.61 μmol/g) with the enriched renewable VO regardless of the poor CO2 and H2O in air. This work opens up new possibilities for the practical application of natural photosynthesis.

The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuel using solar energy holds significant promise. However, the inefficient use of light and poor production activity have hindered its development. Here, we propose a simple in situ annealing oxidation method by coating a layer of TiO2 outside TiN, a material with a favorable price and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, to create an L-TiNO composite. The yield of CO over L-TiNO (50.8 μmol g−1 h−1) is 56.4 times that over TiO2 (0.9 μmol g−1 h−1) under visible light irradiation in pure aqueous environment, with a selectivity of 95.98%. In-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements reflect the CO2-COOH⁎-CO conversion route happening on L-TiNO. Characterizations like the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) technique confirm the generation of built-in electric field, which facilitates efficient carrier separation and migration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support that L-TiNO with LSPR effect alters the shape of absorbed CO2 to facilitate generation COOH⁎ via forming hydroxyl end group (Ti-OH) and promotes CO⁎ desorption to CO(g). This work provides valuable insights into the coupling of plasmonic materials with semiconductors to achieve efficient solar energy utilization.

The introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) into photocatalysts has proven to be a successful tactic to boost CO2 reduction. However, the challenge lies in acquiring OV sites that are stable in the long term, highly dispersed, and tunable in concentration. Herein, an innovative configuration, referred to as N-Bi(3+x)+--OV, was developed for the model semiconductor Bi2O2CO3 via an in situ anion doping approach. The structure enables the synthetic photocatalyst to exhibit superb CO2 photoreduction performance, with approximately 100% CO selectivity and remarkable long-term stability. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that replacing O2- with N3- uniformly in the [Bi2O2]2+ structural unit increases the chemical valence of Bi, elongates nearby Bi─O bonds, releases lattice O, improves CO2 absorption, and decreases the energy barrier for the formation of the critical intermediate *COOH. This study offers new insights and potential opportunities for the development of reliable defect-type semiconductors and their catalytic applications.

Carbon dioxide-expanded liquids, organic solvents with high concentrations of soluble carbon dioxide (CO2) at mild pressures, have gained attention as green catalytic media due to their improved properties over traditional solvents. More recently, carbon dioxide-expanded electrolytes (CXEs) have demonstrated improved reaction rates in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, by increasing the rate of delivery of CO2 to the electrode while maintaining facile charge transport. However, recent studies indicate that the limiting behavior of CXEs at higher CO2 pressures is a decline in solution conductivity due to reduced polarity, leading to poorer charge screening and greater ion pairing. In this article, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the energetic driving forces behind the diffusive properties of an acetonitrile and tetrapropylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TPrAPF6) CXE with increasing CO2 concentration. Our results indicate that entropy drives solvent and electrolyte diffusion with increasing CO2 pressure. The activation energy of ion diffusion increases with higher concentrations of CO2, indicating that increasing the temperature may improve solution conductivity in these systems. This trend in the activation energies is traced to stronger cation–anion Coulombic interactions due to weaker solvent screening at high CO2 concentrations, suggesting that the choice of ion may provide a route to diminish this effect.

Based on 208 city-level data in China, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of ESG rating on carbon emissions through the SDM spatial metrology model, identifies the direct and indirect consequences and spatial spillover effects of ESG rating on carbon emissions, and compares the regional heterogeneity and city-size heterogeneity of such impacts. This paper draws three conclusions: (1) Empirical evidence shows that the ESG rating performance of enterprises has a significant inhibition effect on carbon dioxide emissions. Specifically, when the ESG rating performance increases by 1%, carbon emissions will decrease by 0.076; among other control variables, the effect of FDI on carbon emission reduction is that when ESG score performance increases by 1%, carbon emission decreases by 0.022. (2) In the decomposition of the total effects, indirect effects and direct effects have the same impact on carbon emissions, and the total effect is −0.393. (3) The inhibition effect is more significant in the Eastern Region and in megacities, where the effect of −0.096 in the Eastern Region is more obvious than that of −0.078 at the national level, and the effect of carbon reduction in megacities is significantly greater than 0.013 in big cities. This suggests regional heterogeneity in regards to the role of ESG ratings in reducing CO2 emissions. This paper reveals the specific effects and internal logic of the impact of ESG performance on CO2 emissions, which has certain implications for various regions to further promote the construction of an ESG system, according to local conditions, and to encourage enterprises to focus on emission reduction and high-quality development.

This study aimed to investigate the supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) drying of cod (Gadus spp.) by developing and optimizing a general mathematical drying model. We applied a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) considering the time (180–360 min), temperature (35–45 °C), and CO2 flow rate (15–25 kg/h) as independent factors, aiming at the reduction of moisture and water activity (aw) of Gadus morhua. Time and flow rate (FR) were the main factors affecting the moisture and aw responses. The mathematical models developed were validated with the accuracy and bias factors and generalized using Gadus chalcogrammus samples, resulting in the acceptable range of 1.003–1.121. The optimal parameter values for drying performance were 312.38 min, 45.38 °C, and 27.4 kg/h (R2 = 0.999). Our results suggest a promising application of SC-CO2 as a fish drying technology, describing a generalist-validated and optimized SC-CO2 drying model for Gadus spp. The present study collaborates with understanding supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) as an innovative fish drying technology at a laboratory scale. The optimal variables that were effective in reducing cod fillets water content were 312.38 min, 45.38 °C, and 27.4 kg/h, in which 26.4% moisture and 0.815 aw were predicted. Therefore, SC-CO2 is suggested to be a promising non-thermal food drying technology applied to fish products.

Capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is challenging and thermodynamically expensive because of its dilute concentration (421 ppm, December 2023). Utilizing the concentrating effect of dissolving atmospheric CO2 in alkaline solution to form dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), we explored the potential of an alkalotolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanococcus vannielii, to capture and convert CO2 at low partial pressures to methane. Kinetic constants for CO2 reduction to CH4 were determined from experiments in serum bottles at low pCO2 at 30˚C. At pH 7, 8, and 9, the apparent KM is 0.4, 1.2, and 1.2 mM DIC and the apparent vmax is 5.6, 7.8, and 2.9 mmol CH4 L−1 OD−1 hr−1, respectively. Using atmosphere-equilibrated DIC concentrations at pH 7, 8, and 9, methane formation rates were 1.1, 2.3, and 2.1 mmol CH4 L−1 OD−1 hr−1, respectively. Our data show that alkaline hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is an alternative to photosynthetic CO2 fixation for biological capture and conversion of CO2 at atmospheric concentrations at reasonable rates.

Human activities have significantly contributed to the increase in global carbon emissions, leading to adverse environmental effects such as global warming. Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) presents a promising approach to mitigate carbon emissions. This process not only stores the low energy density renewable energies into high energy density chemical bonds, but also produces a variety of valuable products, including one‐carbon products like HCOOH and CO, as well as multi‐carbon products like CH3CH2OH and C2H4. Among them, HCOOH and CO can be produced with over 90% selectivity on various catalysts, indicating their potential for large‐scale applications. However, the precise reaction pathways toward CO and HCOOH remain unclear, and the competition between these pathways often leads to low product selectivity. This review provides an overview of current research on the selective reduction of CO2 to CO and/or HCOOH, encompassing theoretical simulations, catalyst design, and investigations into reaction mechanisms. Additionally, this review highlights the challenges and prospects for the further development and understanding of selective catalysts for CO and HCOOH production, aiming to provide valuable insights for future studies in this intriguing and significant research field.

Achieving sustainable environmental quality has become a critical global issue, necessitating the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate environmental pollution. Hydropower energy has the potential to play a significant role in this effort by providing a clean, renewable energy source that can help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease CO2 emissions. This study examines the dynamic impact of hydropower energy consumption, economic growth, capital, and labor on Indonesia's CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2020. Applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method, the findings demonstrate that hydropower energy consumption has a negative effect on CO2 emissions in both the short and long term, indicating that increasing hydropower energy consumption leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions. Conversely, labor exhibits a positive influence on CO2 emissions in both the short and long term, suggesting that a rise in labor contributes to higher levels of CO2 emissions in Indonesia. Furthermore, the Granger causality analysis reveals a bidirectional relationship between CO2 emissions and hydropower energy consumption. The robustness of ARDL results is confirmed through additional tests using Fully-Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS), and Canonical Cointegrating Regressions (CCR) methods. The findings underscore the importance of promoting sustainable hydropower energy for effective environmental management in Indonesia. Policymakers should prioritize investments in sustainable hydropower infrastructure, encourage the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, and develop a skilled workforce to mitigate the environmental impact of increased labor force participation.

Abstract Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is expected to play a critical role in reaching net zero CO2 and especially net zero GHG emissions. However, the extent to which the role of CDR in counterbalancing residual emissions can be reduced has not yet been fully quantified. Here, we use a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model to develop a “Maximum Sectoral Effort” scenario which features global emissions policies alongside ambitious effort across sectors to reduce their gross GHG emissions and thereby the CDR required for offsets. We find that these efforts can reduce CDR by over 50% globally, increase both the relative and absolute role of the land sink in storing carbon, and more evenly distribute CDR contributions and associated side-effects across regions compared to CO2 pricing alone. Furthermore, the lower cumulative CO2 and nonCO2 emissions leads to earlier and lower peak temperatures. Emphasizing reductions in gross, in addition to net emissions while disallowing the substitution of less durable CDR for offsets can therefore reduce both physical and transition risks associated with high CDR deployment and temperature overshoot.&#xD;

Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) is one of the viable and efficient technology to capture the carbon dioxide from combustion process due to inherent removal of nitrogen. In a typical CLC, combustion of fuel takes place in absence of air, where metal oxides such as ilmenite acts as oxygen carriers therefore, the resultant flue gas contains ∼99% by volume of carbon dioxide. The current work focuses on energy analysis of the chemical looping combustion using Rankine cycles of 662 MWth power plant. The thermal cycle under consideration is conceived with idea of integrating the energy flow between fuel and air reactor and as well as preheating the air and fuel before entering the respective reactors. For the comparative study of thermal performance natural gas and syngas with oxygen carriers nickel oxide with alumina and ilmenite are considered respectively. The composition of syngas under consideration is assumed to be the same as that of generated from gasification of bituminous coal. The energy balance shows that the gross thermal efficiency of the natural gas based CLC thermal cycle and syngas based CLC cycles are 44.99% and 44.80% respectively whereas the net efficiency is found to be 40.13% and 37.6% with carbon capture and compression respectively. The reason for large reduction in net efficiency in the case of syngas-CLC plant is attributed to increase in auxiliary power consumption than natural gas-CLC power plant. The carbon dioxide concentration is higher in case of syngas as it contains higher carbon to hydrogen ratio than that of natural gas. It is also found in the study that carbon capture efficiency is 100% in case of natural gas-CLC power plant whereas for syngas-CLC power plant CO2 capture efficiency is 89.55%.

The steel industry in Brazil is responsible for around 5% of total carbon dioxide emissions, releasing around 1.85 tons of CO2 for every ton of steel produced. The use of charcoal in self-reducing iron ore briquettes can be an alternative to reduce fossil fuel consumption and reduce carbon emissions in the primary steelmaking industry, however, the particle size can affect the reduction process. This study aims to analyze the reduction kinetics of charcoal briquettes in three particle size ranges. To this end, the charcoal was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis to determine the contents of fixed carbon, ash and volatiles, analysis of sulphur in the charcoal by combustion in a tube furnace, determination of particle size by laser granulometer, elemental chemical analysis of the charcoal ash by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The briquettes were reduced in a thermogravimetric balance to 1100 °C with heating rates between 10 and 40 °C/min. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction. Finally, a kinetic study was carried out using the Coats-Redfern method. In all the briquettes, the controlling mechanism was diffusion. In the mixture with fines, the activation energy ranged from 31.95 to 33.72 kJ/mol and 120.29 to 137.17 kJ/mol. For the mixture with medium grain size, the activation energy ranged from 58.1 to 89.42 kJ/mol and 107.83 to 153.50 kJ/mol. X-ray diffraction revealed phases of hematite and magnetite at 800 °C, while at 900 °C phases of wustite and faialite and metallic iron were identified.

Abstract As a trend of using colloidal and smaller ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) at the shallow trench isolation (STI) chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) in semiconductor manufacturing, post-CMP cleaning challenges in the removal of residual CNPs on the SiO2 film surface became much more challenging.&#xD;We investigated the reduction/oxidation of ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) by hydrogen gas-dissolved water (H2 GDW), carbon dioxide gas-dissolved water (CO2 GDW), and oxygen gas-dissolved water (O2 GDW). The concentration of Ce3+ on the CNPs changed from 18.64% to 19.48%, 20.31% to 21.94%, and 21.27% to 19.22%, respectively, after immersion in H2 GDW, CO2 GDW, and O2 GDW for 3 to 12 h. Following the Ce3+ concentration of the CNP surface, adhesion energies between CNPs immersed in H2 GDW, CO2 GDW, and O2 GDW for 6 hours with SiO2 surface were 6.06E-16 J, 6.18E-16 J, and 4.83E-16 J. Cleaning experiments under megasonic conditions revealed the efficacy of H2 GDW and O2 GDW in removing residual CNPs from SiO2 surfaces. The residual cerium (Ce) ion concentrations remaining on the SiO2 film surface after cleaning, were 0.06, 0.41, and 0.10 ppb for H2 GDW, CO2 GDW, and O2 GDW, respectively.&#xD;

This study proposes a prospective approach to address the challenge of uneven renewable energy distribution by proposing a renewable energy supply chain leveraging MeOH-fueled Allam Cycle for power generation. This solution aims to meet the escalating demand for renewable energy while ensuring efficient energy transportation and storage. Regions with surplus renewable energy can produce MeOH using green H2 and recycled carbon dioxide (CO2), which can then be transported to regions lacking renewable energy. In importing regions, MeOH is utilized as fuel for electricity generation via Allam Cycle, with captured CO2 recycled for MeOH synthesis, establishing a closed-loop carbon circulation system. The energy, economic and environmental aspects of this supply chain is evaluated and the electricity costs in importing regions are projected to decrease from USD 232.41/MWhe to USD 101.57/MWhe, with MeOH costs dropping from USD 583.47/t to USD 171.48/t, suppose the costs of renewable electricity in exporting regions decrease from USD 45/MWhe to USD 15/MWhe over time. Comparative analysis indicates the energy conversion and transportation costs are acceptable, where the electricity conversion rate is 30.65%-37.07%. Moreover, integration of renewable energy into the supply chain results in a substantial reduction in process carbon emissions, estimated at approximately 90%. Finally, the proposed design showcases a promising and cost-effective solution for achieving a sustainable future, with the onshore wind supply chain exhibiting lower emissions within the range of 51.250-57.464 kg/MWhe.

The main purpose of this study is to quantify and compare the embodied carbon (EC) from the materials used or designed to build the Adohi Hall, a residence building located on the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville, AR. It has been constructed as a mass timber structure. It is compared to the same building design with a steel frame for this study. Based on the defined goal and scope of the project, all materials used in the building structure are compared for their global warming potential (GWP) impact by applying a life cycle assessment (LCA) using a cradle-to-construction site system boundary. This comparative building LCA comprises the product stage (including raw material extraction, processing, transporting, and manufacturing) plus transportation to the construction site (nodule A1–A4, according to standard EN 15804 definitions). In this study, GWP is primarily assessed with the exclusion of other environmental factors. Tally®, as one of the most popular LCA tools for buildings, is used in this comparative LCA analysis. In this study, the substitution of mass timber for a steel structure with a corrugated steel deck and concrete topping offers a promising opportunity to understand the GWP impact of each structure. Mass timber structures exhibit superior environmental attributes considering the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq). Emissions per square meter of gross floor area for mass timber stand at 198 kg, in stark contrast to the 243 kg CO2 eq recorded for steel structures. This means the mass timber building achieved a 19% reduction in carbon emissions compared to the functional equivalent steel structure within the building modules A1 to A4 studied. When considering carbon storage, about 2757 tonnes of CO2 eq are stored in the mass timber building, presenting further benefits of carbon emission delays for the life span of the structure. The substitution benefit from this construction case was studied through the displacement factor (DF) quantification following the standard process. A 0.28 DF was obtained when using mass timber over steel in the structure. This study provides insights into making more environmentally efficient decisions in buildings and helps in the move forward to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and address GWP mitigation.

Africa possesses a profusion of renewable energy resources that can address the continent's need for electricity to foster economic development and achieve international objectives for carbon dioxide mitigation. Green hydrogen stands out as promising among the plethora of available energy production, transportation, and storage technologies. The current study offers a general outlook on green hydrogen production utilizing solar and wind energies powering the water electrolyzers. This analysis estimates the electricity production and its production cost, hydrogen production and production cost, carbon dioxide mitigation, and estimation of the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 2030 in each African country. The results reveal that hydrogen production from solar energy outweighs that from wind. The minimum and maximum power consumption are 64.26–65.46 kWh/kgH2 for the PV/H2 system and 53.62–64.8 kWh/kgH2 for the WT/H2 system. Moreover, the LCOH ranges from 4.6 to 7.31 $/kg for the PV/H2 system and 5.6 to more than 20 $/kg for the WT/H2 system. Namibia and Egypt have significant LCOH of the PV/H2 system with 4.6 and 4.64 $/kg, while Cape Verde and Djibouti have remarkable LCOH of 5.6 and 6.37 $/kg of the WT/H2 system. The percentage reduction in LCOH is 25.23% for the WT/H2 system and 37% for the PV/H2 system due to adopting the 2030 cost scenario. Moreover, adsorption-based atmospheric water is considered a suitable solution for water supply in arid regions. Finally, the CO2 mitigation ranges from 109.8 to 177.7 kg/m2 for the PV/H2 and 0.1–50.4 kg/m2 for the WT/H2.

The global need to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions prompted studies on sustainable alternatives to conventional concrete made with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) binders. Alkali-activated ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is a promising sustainable to OPC in terms of the impact on the environment and reduction of CO2 emissions. Concretes and mortars made with alkali-activated binders demonstrate promising fresh and mechanical properties. This article presents the findings of an experimental study investigating the fresh and mechanical properties of mortar using alkali-activated GGBS binder. The activators used were sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution with 6 M, 8 M, 10 M, and 12 M molarities. The study assessed their initial setting time, workability, and 28-day compressive strength. The study evaluated the effect of partial replacement of GGBS with 5 % silica fume. The compressive strength was determined after 28 days of curing in three different environments: 1) ambient air temperature, 2) water submersion, and 3) water immersion for 7 days followed by 21 air curing in ambient temperature. The results showed an increase in compressive strength with higher NaOH concentration but a corresponding decrease in initial setting time and flowability. Depending on the curing method, efflorescence, and blue-green pigmentation were seen during the physical assessment of the samples. The highest 28-day compressive strength was 67.5 MPa when the NaOH activator molarity was 10 mol/L which represents an optimum concentration for strength development. Replacing 5 % of the GGBS binder with silica fume resulted in a decrease in the 28-day compressive strength and workability without affecting the initial setting time.

The role of methane (CH4) in the 21st century presents a critical dilemma. Its abundance and clean-burning nature make it a promising energy source, while its potent greenhouse effect threatens climate stability. Despite its potent greenhouse gas (GHG) nature, CH4 remains a crucial energy resource. However, advancements in CH4 capture, utilization, and emissions mitigation are rapidly evolving, necessitating a critical assessment of the advances, their potential, and challenges. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the current state of the art in these advancements, particularly focusing on the emissions trends, with corresponding global warming potentials of projected CH4 emissions, and a discussion on the advances that have been made towards reducing the impacts of CH4 emissions. The areas of these advances include measurement, computational, numerical modeling, and simulation studies for CH4, emerging technologies for CH4 production, management and control, the nexus of CH4 –X, and case study applications in countries. This study reports on these advances, which involves a technical review of studies, mainly from the last decade, discussing the technical feasibility, economic viability, and environmental impact of these advancements. Our trend analysis reveals that even though the share of CH4 in the GHG mix has been around 19% compared with carbon dioxide (CO2), still, CH4 reduction would need to be highly subsidized because of the high global warming potential it has, compared with CO2. We conclude that while significant progress has been made, further research and development are essential to optimize the performance, scalability, and affordability of these advancements. Additionally, robust policy frameworks and international collaborations are crucial to ensure widespread adoption and maximize the potential that comes with the advancements in the mitigation of the impact of CH4 emission. This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on balancing the potentials of CH4 with its environmental footprint, paving the way for a future where this versatile resource can be utilized sustainably.

## Using the Past to Inform the Future: How a Classic Respiratory Physiology Equation Informs Computer-Based Simulators and Clinical Decision Support Systems*

Managing mechanical ventilation is a core component of an intensivist's daily work, and optimizing ventilator management continues to be a major focus of pediatric critical care research (1). Physiologic models of human respiration help illustrate core principles and can guide clinicians in titrating ventilator parameters (2). Such physiologic models, when implemented in software with graphical user interfaces, can give rise to virtual patient simulators, allowing clinicians to test the impact of potential ventilator changes, to suggest ventilator changes, or even to make ventilator changes autonomously (3). However, accurate implementation of such models, particularly for children, has proven challenging (2). Are the models reliable? Do they respond to inputs the way real patients do? In this issue of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Pelletier et al (4) highlight these challenges by testing how well one classic physiologic equation, described by Wexler and Lok (5) and originally evaluated in 50 adult patients, performed in a large pediatric cohort. The equation demonstrates that, assuming constant carbon dioxide production (V̇co2), unchanged ratio of dead space to tidal volume (Vd/Vt), and no spontaneous breathing, Paco2 varies inversely with minute ventilation. Pelletier et al (4) examined 484 patients who were mechanically ventilated while under neuromuscular blockade. Among 15,121 arterial blood gas (ABG) values, there was a median prediction error of 0.00 mm Hg (interquartile range, –3.07 to 3.00 mm Hg). However, practically speaking, the authors rightly note that only 68% of measured ABG values were within ± 5 mm Hg of the predicted values. Pelletier et al (4) made a pragmatic choice to include ABG values up to 6 hours after ventilator changes. In their particularly ill patient population—with frequent comorbidities (87% of patients), prolonged neuromuscular blockade (median 4 d), and high mortality (12%)—other changes in patient physiology, including changes in V̇co2, bicarbonate clearance, or alveolar dead space, likely also impact ABG values, independent of the product of respiratory rate and tidal volume (6). Pelletier et al (4) also examined clinicians' ventilatory rate changes in a subset of ABGs in which adjustment of minute ventilation to maintain an acceptable pH was indicated. Of note, the authors constrained the problem space by excluding scenarios where ventilator parameters other than the set rate (e.g., tidal volume) were adjusted. They compared the clinician's change in respiratory rate vs. the change recommended by the equation and used the subsequent blood gas to determine whether the clinician or the calculator made the "better" choice. In most scenarios (75% vs. 23%), the authors found that the calculator's recommendation outperformed the clinician's judgment. Furthermore, there was a marked difference when comparing ABGs that required escalation vs. weaning of minute ventilation. When the ABG indicated respiratory acidosis requiring increased minute ventilation, clinicians' rate changes outperformed calculator recommendations for 53% of ABGs. In contrast, when the ABG suggested a wean was indicated, the clinician's choice was better in only 21% of scenarios. This finding is concordant with prior literature that computerized clinical decision support (CDS) systems for mechanical ventilation management are particularly effective for the weaning phase (7). Prior work suggested that these benefits may be achieved because closed-loop systems, such as those reviewed in (7), can effect ventilator changes more frequently and more consistently than humans. The study by Pelletier et al (4) suggests that an additional factor may be that PICU clinicians tend to wean the ventilator in smaller increments than might be physiologically warranted. A key element of well-implemented CDS systems is users' understanding of and faith in the algorithm's recommendations (8). The findings by Pelletier et al (4) could be incorporated into a future CDS system that nudges clinicians toward making larger ventilator weans by showing the mathematical model behind the recommendation and reminding clinicians that in most cases in the study by Pelletier et al (4) the larger wean resulted in a "better" subsequent ABG than the clinicians' intuition. By limiting their analysis to patients receiving neuromuscular blockade, Pelletier et al (4) removed the effects of varying breath-to-breath minute ventilation in spontaneously breathing patients. This constraint is necessary to apply the Wexler and Lok (5) equation but reduces applicability at the bedside. Additional limitations of the current work, also appropriately noted by the authors, include the lack of clinical detail about the patient population and, in particular, whether some patients may have had clinical indications for the clinicians' more conservative weaning choices. For instance, in patients with pulmonary hypertension, where respiratory acidosis may be more poorly tolerated, decreasing the ventilatory rate in smaller increments may be logical. It is important to note that serial ABGs in patients are not statistically independent. Indeed, a future computerized CDS system could use modern machine learning methods like reinforcement learning (9) to adjust the system's recommendation for subsequent ventilator changes based on whether a Paco2 after an index ventilator change resulted in an ABG that was higher or lower than expected, much as clinicians do at the bedside. Perhaps the most intriguing application of the work by Pelletier et al (4) may be for informing physiologically based computerized teaching platforms for critical care. Such medical simulators are prevalent (10), and some studies show that they can be effective teaching aids (11). Still, less emphasis has been placed on validating the physiologic accuracy of the models underlying these teaching tools (12). The authors provide a link to a prototype teaching platform that they designed and are testing. A formal evaluation of the educational effectiveness of the platform will be a valuable contribution. Insightfully, on their website, the authors explain the effects of changes to V̇co2 and Vd/Vt on their estimates of Paco2. Thus, the authors turn limitations into teachable moments. Some may wonder why CDS systems and "serious games" continue to rely on simplified physiologic models when our electronic health records provide a wealth of data on ventilator changes and resulting blood gas values from actual patients. These records, however, provide information only on what clinicians actually did. If clinicians never reduced the respiratory rate by 10, the model will struggle to extrapolate the impact of such a reduction in a future scenario. Physiologic equations like that of Wexler and Lok (5) certainly have their limitations, but the work of Pelletier et al (4) suggests that validating and incorporating such models into our training and CDS systems could start nudging us toward bigger ventilator weans. These bigger weans will generate more data on the effects of such weans for future models and could ultimately shorten the time to liberation from mechanical ventilation.

The power industry is a major contributor to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission, which accounting for 40% of total domestic carbon emission. Based on the carbon emission accounting method, this paper conducts carbon emission accounting for a number of power generation enterprises, analyses and concludes that the carbon quota allocation is being tightened year by year, proposed countermeasures and emission reduction routes in terms of carbon asset management and carbon reduction technology research. According to the actual situation of a coal-fired power plant in Anhui province, different carbon reduction routes are developed, among which photovoltaic power generation project has the most impressive economic benefits, but carbon capture project has the largest carbon reduction benefits. Under the premise of similar initial investment between the two projects, the carbon reduction brought by the latter is 5 times that of the former. It is suggested to choose the “new energy power generation+carbon capture and utilization” coupling technical route, which can improve the flexible operation of thermal power units and the absorption rate of new energy, and achieve efficient decarbonization. It provides a sustainable development technical route with both economic and environmental benefits for the low-carbon process.

Abstract The European ammonia industry emits 36 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, primarily from steam methane reforming (SMR) hydrogen production. These emissions can be mitigated by producing hydrogen via water electrolysis using dedicated renewables with grid backup. This study investigates the impact of decarbonization targets for hydrogen synthesis on the economic viability and technical feasibility of retrofitting existing European ammonia plants for on-site, semi-islanded electrolytic hydrogen production. Results show that electrolytic hydrogen cuts emissions, on average, by 85% (36%-100% based on grid price and carbon intensity), even without enforcing emission limits. However, an optimal lifespan average well-to-gate emission cap of 1 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e)/kg H 2 leads to a 95% reduction (92%-100%) while maintaining cost-competitiveness with SMR in renewable-rich regions (mean levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 4.1 euro/kg H 2 ). Conversely, a 100% emissions reduction target dramatically increases costs (mean LCOH: 6.3 euro/kg H 2 ) and land area for renewables installations, likely hindering the transition to electrolytic hydrogen in regions with poor renewables and limited land. Increasing plant flexibility effectively reduces costs, particularly in off-grid plants (mean reduction: 32%). This work guides policymakers in defining cost-effective decarbonization targets and identifying region-based strategies to support an electrolytic hydrogen-fed ammonia industry.

Solar-generated electricity is considered the best substitute to increase the green energy share in the grid, in the Indian scenario. However, India is geographically diverse; there are different climatic zones, while the policy remains the same and reverse bidding for grid connected solar power is not climate specific. The degradation factor is considered universal, as per the manufacturer's set standard of between 0.6% and 0.8%, with 2% in the first year due to light-induced degradation (LID). The climate-specific defects of solar panels, their reasons, mitigation measures, and impact on operational cost are indicated. It is concluded that metallization is the most common defect in the composite region, while interlink breakage is the most common in hot and dry regions. It is found that fill factor (FF) reduction due to interlink breakages in hot climates contributes to the maximum power (Pmax) degradation in the hot and dry zone, while short circuit current (Isc) due to water ingress and temperature variations is the Pmax reduction contributor in the composite region. It is found that the cold and cloudy zone have the least degradation rates of 0.8% annually, while hot and dry regions have an average of 1.5% annually. An investigation is done to identify the impact on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), internal rate of return (IRR), carbon dioxide (CO2) saving, and eligibility for clean energy regulator (CER) certificate for different climatic zones. The LCOE and IRR are better for cold and cloudy regions, which have the least degradation levels, while irrespective of good radiation in the hot and dry regions the LCOE increases with increased degradation levels. Sensitivity analysis is done on a 1-MW solar ground-mounted plant with polycrystalline technology operating in hot and dry regions, by varying the capital cost, operational cost, escalation in operational cost, bid escalation percentage, and degradation levels with an objective to achieve the benchmark of INR 2.44/kWh, the lowest bid pricing in 2018 in India. At an annual degradation rate of 1.5%, the solar PV plant operating in the hot and dry zone with a capital cost of 400 lakhs INR, 5% operation maintenance (O&M) cost with 3.5% escalation, 2% debt interest rate in 70:30 debt-equity model, and 2% escalation on grid intake pricing will achieve an IRR of 3.85% and LCOE of 2.5 INR. The IRR and the LCOE can be bettered by reducing the annual degradation rates from 1.5%. The sensitivity analysis concludes that while O&M cost to mitigate the climate-specific defects and its annual escalation rates is the critical component in the LCOE and IRR, the same cannot be compromised since the higher degradation rates can affect the cost economics.

The exacerbation of environmental pollution and global warming has become more pronounced in the context of economic growth. To address these challenges, the United Nations has put forth the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets, which serve as the primary internationally agreed normative and guiding framework for achieving global sustainable social, economic, and environmental development. Marine ranch, as a model of sustainable fisheries development, responds to the SDGs and promotes marine development in an eco-friendly manner, by cultivating shellfish and algae to effectively absorb carbon dioxide and excess nutrients. This novel study utilizes a quasi-natural experiment of the pilot policy implemented in national-level marine ranch demonstration zones to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of carbon emissions and seawater eutrophication indexes. Panel data from 52 coastal cities spanning the period from 2013 to 2021 are employed to explore the synergistic effects of national-level marine ranches on carbon emission reduction and the improvement of seawater eutrophication status. Analytical tools such as spatial auto-correlation, local cold and hot spot analysis, kernel density analysis, standard deviation ellipse, and multi-period difference-in-difference model were applied to the study. The findings reveal that carbon dioxide emissions and seawater eutrophication indexes show a clustering trend, with carbon emission hotspots expanding towards the northeast and the eutrophication index concentrating in the Bohai Economic Circle. Furthermore, the establishment of national-level marine ranches can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions and weaken the degree of eutrophication in the process of urban development. To enhance the quality of China's ecological environment and further explore the ecological and environmental benefits of marine pastures, additional research and investigation are warranted.

Methanotrophy is a biological process that effectively reduces global methane emissions by utilizing microorganisms that can utilize methane as a source of energy under both oxic and anoxic conditions, using a variety of different electron acceptors. Methanotrophic microbes, which utilize methane as their primary source of carbon and energy, are microorganisms found in various environments, such as soil, sediments, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. These microbes play a significant role in the global carbon cycle by consuming methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and converting it into carbon dioxide, which is less harmful. However, methane is known to be the primary contributor to ozone formation and is considered a major greenhouse gas. Methane alone contributes to 30% of global warming; its emissions increased by over 32% over the last three decades and thus affect humans, animals, and vegetation adversely. There are different sources of methane emissions, like agricultural activities, wastewater management, landfills, coal mining, wetlands, and certain industrial processes. In view of the adverse effects of methane, urgent measures are required to reduce emissions. Methanotrophs have attracted attention as multifunctional bacteria with potential applications in biological methane mitigation and environmental bioremediation. Methanotrophs utilize methane as a carbon and energy source and play significant roles in biogeochemical cycles by oxidizing methane, which is coupled to the reduction of various electron acceptors. Methanotrophy, a natural process that converts methane into carbon dioxide, presents a promising solution to mitigate global methane emissions and reduce their impact on climate change. Nonetheless, additional research is necessary to enhance and expand these approaches for extensive use. In this review, we summarize the key sources of methane, mitigation strategies, microbial aspects, and the application of methanotrophs in global methane sinks with increasing anthropogenic methane emissions.

This paper focuses on the impact that urban traffic has on the environment. The study characterizes the global effect of GHG emissions, including the ecologic evaluation and the characterization, normalization, and evaluation factor. The work makes a detailed survey of the different modes of driving and their influence on engine performance as one of the principal causes of gas emissions during the combustion process. The article analyzes six types of vehicles equipped with different engine configurations: diesel and gasoline, GLP and GNC, hybrid electric, and plug-in hybrid electric. Simulation of the driving mode under various operational conditions for every type of engine result in energy consumption, thus, in GHG emissions, carbon dioxide and monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and Sulphur dioxide. The study concludes that a reduction in vehicle speed, thus in the engine revolutions, has positive effects on engine combustion and gasses emissions, which is reduced by 27.5%. The study also concludes that the limitation in driving mode, avoiding sharp and sudden acceleration, may reduce up to 45% of GHG emissions. The changes applied in the driving mode improve the air quality in the urban environment, reducing the content of GHG from 39% to 61%.

Abstract Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials, including structural products and Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) pipes, offer significant carbon footprint reduction when compared to traditional steel alternatives. This is because of the lower energy requirements needed for manufacturing and the lower energy use throughout the product's service life cycle. Global warming and the energy crisis make the use of FRP an attractive material of choice because its use results in less carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere. Climate change affects our competitive landscape in many ways. Businesses face higher raw material prices, rising energy costs, and increasing awareness of manufacturers' and suppliers' environmental impact. Companies that focus on managing and mitigating their carbon footprint will have a competitive advantage over rivals in a carbon-constrained future. They will also be able to conduct their operations in an environmentally sustainable way.

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction offers a low‐carbon route to ethylene, when powered from renewable energy. Yet, the best‐performing CO 2 electrolysis systems employ neutral or alkaline electrolytes, resulting in low conversion efficiencies, which increases downstream separation costs. High conversion rates can be achieved with acidic electrolytes, albeit at the cost ethylene faradaic efficiency (FE < 45%). As a result, achieving high ethylene selectivity simultaneously with high conversion efficiency is an unmet challenge. Here, a 3D‐nanoporous catalyst is designed to modulate water and CO 2 concentration at the catalyst surface, reaching higher ethylene selectivity in a forward‐bias bipolar MEA that recovers unreacted CO 2 . An ethylene FE of 63% at 150 mA cm −2 is reported, and by optimizing for conversion efficiency, an ethylene FE of 58% along with an overall conversion efficiency of 82% is achieved. Stable performance for > 65 h at industrial current densities combined with a high ethylene concentration in the product stream showcases promising industrial viability.

Abstract Production chemicals are used to improve fluids production in gas and oil fields. These chemicals can contribute to less than 1% (0,1 kg/boe) of the global CO2 emission of a production site (scope 3). On the other hand, production chemicals can support the reduction of the global CO2 emission (Replacement of High CO2 emission chemicals by lower CO2 emission chemicals; Use more efficient chemicals to reduce chemicals consumption to reduce associated CO2 emission; Use production chemicals to improve energy efficiency or limit greenhouse gas emission…). A methodology, based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), was developed with SIMAPRO®. This methodology is considering the global usage of the chemicals and its impact on the process (production increase, GHG reduction….). Results point out that injection of a more efficient chemical can reduce the global carbon footprint. 2 chemistries were compared to scavenge H2S. The replacement of triazine based scavenger by a MBO base scavenger is leading to a decrease of the scavenger injection rate. Even if the costs ($/L) and the CO2 footprint (kgCO2/L) of MBO are higher, global impacts are positive (45% CO2 emission reduction). Injection of a H2S scavenger to valorize the associated gas produced by an oil field (stop of flaring) shows that it is possible to reduce by more than 99% the global CO2 emissions. Flowing improvement in an oil field pipeline with DRA injection can lead to the reduction of the carbon footprint intensity (reduction of CO2 emission per barrel of oil). Other cases studies confirm that production chemicals (DRA, demulsifier…) management allow improving the global CO2 footprint.

One challenge confronting the Cu2O catalysts in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is the reduction of active Cu(I) species, resulting in low selectivity and quick deactivation. In this study, we for the first time introduce a bottom‐up growth of convex sphere with adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interfaces (Cux@Cu2O convex spheres). Interestingly, the interfaces are dynamically modulated by varying hydrothermal time, thus regulating the conversion of C1 and C2 products. In particular, the 4 h hydrothermal treatment applied to Cu0.25@Cu2O convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface results in the highest selectivity for C2 products (90.5%). In situ Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface lowers the energy barrier for the production of ethylene and ethanol while increasing the coverage of localized *CO adsorbate for increased dimerization. This work establishes a novel approach for transforming the state of valence‐sensitive electrocatalysts into high‐value energy‐related engineering products.

Abstract This paper examines the impact of climate policy uncertainty (CPU) on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions of 1007 listed firms over 2003–2021. As the urgency to combat climate change and implement effective policies may create uncertainty, it focuses on the Unites States, a significant emitter with a complex policy landscape. Using the two‐step system generalized method of moments estimation, the analysis reveals a negative CPU–CO 2 emissions relationship, indicating that increased CPU incentivizes firms to adopt sustainable practices, leading to emissions reductions. Capital expenditures have similar effects on emissions, accompanied by increased corporate sustainability engagement. However, no significant relationship is found between research and development (R&D) expenditure and CO 2 emissions, nor does CPU significantly moderate the R&D–CO 2 emissions nexus. Firms with substantial fixed assets exhibit higher CO 2 emissions, while heavy emitters demonstrate limited CPU responsiveness. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers encouraging corporate participation in emissions reduction efforts.

Electrocatalysts play a critical role in energy technologies, but the development of active, efficient, and durable catalysts is impeded by the lack of methodologies to deconvolute the complex interplay between various aspects influencing the activity of the catalysts, e.g., the number of active sites, turnover frequency, and the reaction pathways. Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) is an emerging tool for the analysis of electroactive species and has been successfully applied to a variety of reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and hydrogen oxidation reaction. The harmonics generated from FTacV measurements neatly detect underlaying processes not visible by other, more commonly employed techniques for analysis of electrocatalysts, such as the rotating disc electrode and dc voltammetry. The harmonic components enable separating overlapping processes based on differences in kinetics or linearity of response. This paper presents a review of FTacV applied for the analysis of electrocatalysts. It highlights the importance of determining the electrochemically active site density (EASD) to decipher the intrinsic activity of a catalyst and discusses the use of FTacV in dynamic determination of the EASD over the course of a catalyst's working life, as well as the use of FTacV to understand intricate catalytic processes.

The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in water is an important key indicator of the quality of Ultra-pure water, which is useful in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, among others. Therefore, as a technology to measure TOC, a technology that measures the amount of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by electrical conductivity is being developed. This method uses ultraviolet light and an oxidizing agent to oxidize organic compounds to produce CO<sub>2</sub>, and measures the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> by measuring the electrical conductivity based on the permeable membrane of the gas, and then converts it to the concentration of TOC in the organic compound. In this study, we presented the design conditions of the alternating current control circuit applied between the two electrodes of the electrical conductivity cell, the microcurrent signal detection, voltage conversion circuit, and the amplification and noise reduction circuit for measuring the low concentration of TOC required for ultrapure water. Based on the optimal design conditions, we have fabricated a PCB for ultra-precise electrical conductivity measurement for low concentration TOC analysis using membrane conductivity, and have compared the results with a commercial product.

With increasing construction and demolition waste, the demand for recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) has risen, yet their inherent poor-quality limits usage. In response, CO2 treatment has been developed to enhance RCA quality while contributing to CO2 reduction efforts. This study investigates the effect of CO2 treatment on RCA with high mortar contents for sustainable construction applications. We optimize treatment conditions by evaluating the CO2 consumption ratio and reaction kinetics under various temperatures, pressures, relative humidity, and initial saturation. X-ray imaging confirms carbonation within the mortar, evidenced by increased greyvalues. Environmental assessment of leachate through pH and heavy metal concentration reveals a significant reduction in chromium concentration and a decrease in pH, suggesting the potential of CO2 conditioning to mitigate the environmental impacts. Mechanical tests, the aggregate crushing value test, and the freeze-thaw resistance test, demonstrate improved resistance and durability, particularly in freeze-thaw resistance. The life cycle assessment analysis shows that a simplified CO2 treatment achieved a significant reduction of 138.257 kg CO2 eq per ton of RCA compared to the conventional RCA process. These findings highlight the dual benefits of CO2 treatment: enhanced mechanical performance and reduced environmental impact, promoting the use of recycled aggregates in sustainable construction practices.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States totaled 5,981 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMT CO2eq) in 2020. Of that, GHG emissions by the pulp and paper sector amounted to 35 MMT CO2eq direct emissions and those by industrial waste landfills summed to 7.4 MMT CO2eq direct emissions. Loss of GHG sinks due to change in land use further contributes to the net GHG emissions. Industrial waste landfills are typically required to comply with certain federal and state regulations, including meeting requirements for final cover systems. Conventional final cover systems have included use of soil covers and/or soil-geosynthetic composite covers. An engineered turf cover provides for an excellent “green” alternative final cover system for industrial waste landfills. This paper discusses various sustainability aspects pertaining to use of an engineered turf final cover, including: (i) significantly low carbon footprint associated with the construction of an engineered turf alternative final cover when compared to closure using a traditional or prescriptive cover system; (ii) saving valuable soil and land resources; (iii) saving water resources by reduction in its use during and after construction; (iv) reducing impacts associated with borrow areas; and (v) reducing overall carbon footprint. Further, when using an engineered turf cover, opportunities exist for beneficial reuse of land, including development of solar energy. A brief discussion on the potential for development of solar energy is included.

Methane emissions from livestock being a major contributor to climate change as methane possesses more global warming potential than carbon dioxide, exacerbating the issue. Therefore, reducing methane emissions is crucial in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable agriculture. Tanzania is endowed with a large livestock population and vast rangelands. The resultant enteric methane emissions share in the agriculture sector was estimated to be 39.71% in 2014. This data suggests that interventions to lower methane emissions in agriculture sectors need to focus on livestock especially ruminants to provide significant reduction. The study found that normalisation of emissions can be facilitated by a set of measures, namely: a) increasing the energy content or quality of ruminant feed to reduce the intensity of methane production in the gut; b) addressing existing problems in pasture use, including deforestation, uncontrolled burning, overgrazing, water shortages and invasive species; c) improving feeding in combination with other livestock management practices to achieve the expected productive effect while reducing methane emissions.    

    

## Mixed-Salt Based Transformational Solvent Technology for CO2 Capture

SRI International developed a novel, water-lean, mixed-salt-based transformational solvent technology under a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)/National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)-funded project. This advanced mixed-salt process (A-MSP) can be operated with high cyclic CO2 loading, and the solution can be regenerated with greater than 10 bar CO2 pressure at temperatures less than 120°C. The team has created a process model and performed a techno-economic evaluation (TEA) to identify development pathways for technology advancement. The A-MSP will provide a reduction in the CO2 capture cost and energy penalties and will have the potential for accelerated scale-up to meet the DOE's new target of <30/tonne-CO2 by 2030 for coal-fired power plant applications. Background and Project Description: New solvent technology alternatives to the monoethanolamine (MEA) process for carbon capture use expensive chemicals and result in a high solvent viscosity, low CO2-loading capacity, and low-pressure CO2 product. For over a decade, SRI International has been improving ammonia-based solvents (e.g., MSP) to overcome most of the challenges inherent to conventional amine-based processes. The results from bench-scale testing showed the two-component, dual-stage MSP has significant advantages over other solvent-based systems that were confirmed by extensive modeling and industrial evaluation. In the MSP chemistry, ammonia plays a dual role; it is the catalyst and the absorbent due to its high mobility and reactivity with CO2. Indeed, ammonia absorbs large amounts of CO2 at low temperature and releases CO2 at high temperature and pressure, making it very useful in CO2 absorption formulations. By blending ammonia with other low-capacity and low-reactivity components to suppress the vapor pressure of ammonia in the absorber and increase the CO2 pressure in the regenerator, we have identified the next-generation A-MSP formulation that can provide a step-change reduction in CO2 capture costs. Our initial analysis indicates that inclusion of a tertiary amine to the mixed-salt formulation will yield a high CO2-loading capacity and high-pressure solvent regeneration at low temperature, thus further reducing the energy penalty of CO2 capture. Similar to the original MSP, the concept of operation of the A-MSP includes two isothermal absorbers, a two-stage regenerator, and auxiliary equipment. The absorber system is designed to integrate downstream of the flue gas desulfurization (FGD) unit in a pulverized coal (PC) power plant. Absorbers operate with two different absorbent compositions optimized for efficient absorption and minimum ammonia slip. Both absorbers operate with liquid recycle using heat exchangers to remove the heat of reaction and keep the solution at the proper temperature for optimum performance. In the absorbers, the bottom stages operate with the highest CO2 loading levels (up to 0.7 mole/mole), just above the solid precipitation concentration for the working temperature. The CO2-rich solutions from the absorbers are then sent to the regenerator through crossflow heat exchangers to recover the heat from returning lean solutions. The A-MSP two-stage regenerator produces two CO2-lean salt streams with high and low ammonia content. These streams are drawn from the lower-middle stage and bottom stage of the regenerator. The regenerator is operated under high-pressure isobaric conditions (10-20 bar) and has a temperature gradient in the column (top ~30°C, and bottom ~ 120°C). In the A-MSP design, operating the regenerator at low temperature (~120°C) and high pressure (>10 bar) eliminates water stripping, thus generating an almost-dry CO2 stream (H2Ovap/CO2 <0.02) at high pressure. The benefits are twofold: reduction of regeneration and CO2 compression energy costs (OPEX reduction) and removal of the expensive first CO2 compression stage (CAPEX reduction). The project research activities include thermodynamic modeling and vapor-liquid-equilibrium (VLE) measurements of multicomponent systems that contain ammonia, potassium carbonate, amine, and water; kinetic measurements of CO2 absorption of select compositions, solvent degradation, and aerosol formation studies; and physical parameter measurements. We developed a mass transfer model and process flowsheet simulation to perform a TEA, and we demonstrated the continuous operation of the A-MSP in a large bench-scale integrated absorber-regenerator system.

The pursuit of high efficacy C–C coupling during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction remains a tremendous challenge owing to the high energy barrier of CO2 activation and insufficient coverage of the desired intermediates on catalytic sites. Inspired by the concept of capture‐coupled CO2 activation, we fabricated quinone‐grafted carbon nanofibers via an in situ oxidative carbonylation strategy. The quinone functionality of carbon nanofibers promotes the capture of CO2 followed by activation. At a current density of 400 mA cm‐2, the Faradaic efficiency of ethylene reached 62.9%, and a partial current density of 295 mA cm‐2 was achieved on the quinone‐rich carbon nanofibers. The results of in situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicated that the remarkable selectivity enhancement in ethylene originates from the quinone structure, rather than the electronic properties of Cu particles. The interaction of quinone with CO2 increases the local *CO coverage and simultaneously hinders the co‐adsorption of *H on Cu sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier for C–C coupling and restrains subsequent *CO protonation. The modulation strategy involving specific oxygenated structure, as an independent degree of freedom, guides the design of functionalized carbon materials for tailoring the selectivity of desired products during the CO2 capture and reduction.

The selectivity and stability of catalysts for methanol synthesis from CO2 still remain to be enhanced. In this work, we synthesized a series of Pd/ZrO2 catalysts inversely loaded with various metal oxide promoters (ZnO, In2O3, and CeO2), those would partially cover Pd metal surface and form some new metal-promoter interface, to explore the nature in the performance of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The catalyst synthesized by this approach could limit the growth of Pd particles during the reduction and form new metal–metal oxide interfaces with different functions of CO2 hydrogenation, improving the reaction performance of Pd-ZrO2 catalysts. As a result, the ZnO-Pd/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited the highest CO2 conversion (12.0 %), methanol selectivity (95.6 %), and STY of methanol (472 gMeOHkgcat-1h−1), with excellent stability. The results of HRTEM, H2-TPR, XPS, and XAFS showed that the ZnO-Pd/ZrO2 catalyst had the typical Pd-ZnO interface with Pd2+ species after the H2 reduction, which could enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2. In addition, the in situ DRIFTS and NAP-XPS results implied that the Pd-ZnO interface significantly improved the formation of formate (HCOO*) and methoxy (H3CO*) species, which were considered to be the key intermediates of methanol generation, and thus greatly enhanced the selectivity of methanol.

Natural climate solutions (NCS) offer immediate and cost-effective ways to tackle the climate crisis by transforming atmospheric carbon to soil carbon or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. However, the climate mitigation potential and economic costs of NCS for cropping systems in China remain inconclusive. The major objectives of this study are (i) to estimate the NGHG reduction potential across Chinese main cropping systems caused by NCS, (ii) to quantify the economic costs of adopting optimal management with different abatement potentials. The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was used to estimate the NGHG, including SOC sequestration, N2O emissions, and CH4 emissions. After calibration, we ran the DNDC model with derived data at municipality-level. We estimated the NGHG under current management, adopting optimal management individually, and integrated optimal management to project the maximum NGHG reduction potential caused by NCS. We used the marginal abatement cost method to estimate the economic cost. The four natural climate solutions, N fertilization management (NFM), straw returning management (SRM), tillage management (TM), and rice irrigation management (RIM) can reduce national NGHG in main cropping systems by approximately 118.8 Tg CO2-eq, 116.3 Tg CO2-eq, 35.2 Tg CO2-eq, and 74.4 Tg CO2-eq, respectively. The integrated optimal management may potentially reduce NGHG by 256.9 Tg CO2-eq, equivalent to 90.2% of current NGHG, and 80% of which can be realized at the price of CN¥ 285 (Mg CO2-eq)−1. We further identify the priority NCS for different crops and regions and conclude that nitrogen fertilization management should be the priority NCS at the national level. Our findings highlight the great potential of NGHG reduction by adopting NCS precisely and the importance of optimizing agricultural management as a whole, and they will help policy makers to develop smart-agriculture in China.

Abstract Carbon capture and storage is among a few technologies with the potential to enable significant CO2 emission reductions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as offshore production facilities. Within this context, many offshore operators are evaluating measures to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from their operations including those in Deepwater, and Energy contractors are re-shaping their technological expertise and potential solutions for meeting such challenging and increasing demand for lowering operations emissions. The present paper will focus on a specific potential application, related to the offshore pipeline CO2 transportation from an offshore capture facility (deepwater or shallow water), to a permanent subsea storage location. The work presented is the outcome of a joint effort by Exxon Mobil and Saipem articulated through phases: A framing exercise to shape different scenarios to be analyzed. Engineering execution feasibility screening to characterize the above-mentioned scenarios, and to determine: What are the hurdles for deepwater CO2 capture, transportation via offshore pipeline and its sequestration? The challenges associated with CO2 transportation via an offshore pipeline, are spread among all the areas characterizing the system, e.g.: Flow Assurance: the flowing conditions of CO2 are strongly affected by the impurities content, and the bathymetry which the pipeline path traverses. Material Selection: potential corrosion damage mechanisms must be carefully addressed vs. operating and transient flowing conditions. Structural Integrity: the risk of failure associated with potential Running Ductile Fracture (RDF) must be considered and managed since early design phases. Subsea Equipment: the equipment, not limited to the pipeline and riser, shall be assessed in terms of readiness and technological gaps, if any. Safety: the potential risk of subsea CO2 dispersion shall be carefully evaluated. Economics and Supportive Government Policy: Costs are generally key challenges associated with these potential emissions-reduction initiatives. The study performed covered all the above areas through the involvement of Companies Engineering Departments, SME and Developers. All main building blocks of an offshore CO2 transport system have been analyzed during a high-level conceptual design activity to explore any potential criticality vs. their deployment in the specific application. Location/asset-specific factors, supportive government policy, and continued technological advancements can be expected to remain important elements in operator analyses of the commercial viability of potential emissions reduction initiatives. The findings from the presented activity provide offshore Operators considerations for the possibility of transporting CO2 between offshore CO2 capture location to sequestration reservoirs for permanent storage and provide the offshore industry with useful points of reflection.

The physical properties of shale reservoirs are typically poor, necessitating the use of fracturing technology for effective development. However, the high clay content prevalent in shale formations poses significant challenges for conventional hydraulic fracturing methods. To address this issue, CO2-based fracturing fluid has been proposed as an alternative to mitigate the damage caused by water-based fracturing fluids. In this paper, the applicability of quasi-dry CO2 fracturing in shale reservoirs is examined from three key perspectives: the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid, the fracture characteristics induced by the CO2 fracture fluid, and the potential reservoir damage caused by the fracturing fluid. Firstly, the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid was determined by a rheological experiment. Rheological tests revealed that the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid was significantly influenced by the water–carbon ratio. Specifically, when the water–carbon ratio was 30:70, the maximum viscosity observed could reach 104 mPa·s. Moreover, increasing reservoir temperature resulted in decreased fracturing fluid viscosity, with a 40 °C temperature rise causing a 20% viscosity reduction. Secondly, matrix permeability tests were conducted to investigate permeability alteration during CO2 fracturing fluid invasion. Due to the weak acidity of CO2-based fracturing fluid, the permeability reduction induced by clay hydration was inhibited, and an increase in permeability was observed after a 3-day duration. However, the matrix permeability tends to decrease as the interaction time is prolonged, which means prolonged soaking time can still cause formation damage. Finally, triaxial fracturing experiments facilitated by a three-axis servo pressure device were conducted. The fracture properties were characterized using computed tomography (CT), and 3D reconstruction of fractured samples was conducted based on the CT data. The results demonstrate that CO2 fracturing fluid effectively activates weak cementation surfaces in the rock, promoting the formation of larger and more complex fractures. Hence, CO2 quasi-dry fracturing technology emerges as a method with significant potential, capable of efficiently stimulating shale reservoirs, although a reasonable soaking time is necessary to maximize hydrocarbon production.

Abstract Background Global warming and the increasing risk of natural disasters force us all to act. As the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions has been proven effective but insufficient on its own, Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies emerged to fill the gap. Using CCU technologies, CO 2 is captured and further processed into valuable products instead of being emitted into the atmosphere. Method This study investigates the prevailing public perception of such CCU-based products by the example of clothing and cosmetics. We applied the method of conjoint measurement to experimentally examine context-related factors (= attributes) in different usage settings and explored the consumers’ decision profiles for or against the usage of CCU-based products (cosmetics and clothing). Conjoint measurements were realized as an online experiment, addressing acceptance patterns and preferences in four European countries (Germany, Norway, Spain, and Poland). In addition, we assessed general attitudes and affective assessments of the CCU products. A total of N = 828 participants took part in the study, and the international subsamples were comparable. Results Results revealed that health compatibility is the main adoption-driving factor in the decisions for or against the use of the products. Still, attributes like the environmental impact, product quality, and information flow play an important role as well, even though to a lesser extent. Participants from different countries significantly differ in their cognitive and affective evaluations of acceptance-related attributes. Conclusions The outcome provides insights into differences in Pan-European comparison and helps to understand the public motives and country-specific terms of use for CCU-based products, effectively establishing recommendations for policy and governance.

Abstract The subsea energy industry is under constant pressure, both internally and externally, to provide solutions that better serve the global environment. In recent years the necessity to decarbonize, at every level of the industry, has become one of the most debated concerns globally. The development of additive manufacturing technologies, and their integration into our standard operating practices, presents an opportunity to greatly accelerate our decarbonization efforts. The extent of this opportunity is so vast that we, as a global industry, cannot afford to ignore it. This paper shall present a case wherein additive manufacturing technologies, namely Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and a circular economy mindset were used to manufacture a Tubing Hanger Protector, which is a standard component used in subsea production systems worldwide. The paper shall also cover the series of CO2 footprint calculations that were conducted to underline the potential environmental benefits of adopting such a manufacturing philosophy. Thorough CO2 footprint calculations are presented for manufacturing with additive manufacturing and a circular economy mindset. These are then compared with CO2 footprint calculations for ‘traditional’ manufacturing, wherein a forging is produced and then machined to create the final form of the component. On comparing the CO2 footprint calculations for both manufacturing methods, we see a vast difference in the results. A reduction of over eighty five percent is evident, in favor of the additively manufactured part. Given the built in conservativism of the calculations, i.e. best case data for ‘traditional’ manufacturing and worst case data for additive manufacturing, it is likely that the CO2 footprint reductions stated in this paper are even higher in reality. However, this case study is presented to highlight the opportunities of this type of manufacturing and to serve as a reference to others.

Plastic waste disposal is mounting, with consequences for both environmental and human wellbeing. Addressing the plastic waste challenge through chemically upcycling waste to other products is gaining momentum but can have trade-offs. For example, the conversion of plastic waste into hydrogen rich gas can be achieved via catalytic steam, but this process can release large quantities of CO2 (∼12 kg CO2 per 1 kg H2 production). High-performance bifunctional catalysts, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), offer a potential solution, but suppressing CO2 emissions without compromising H2-rich gas yield remains challenging. Here, we synthesize a new CNTs-bridging nanocomposite by integrating Ni nanoparticles with HY zeolite. Employing this bifunctional CNTs-bridging nanocomposite in the catalytic steam reforming of polyethylene can achieve high-quality H2 yields of up to 2,340 mL/gplastic and a 77% reduction in CO2 emissions (1.68 g CO2 per 1 g H2 production). This work introduces an innovative CNTs-bridging strategy to valorize plastic waste into high-quality H2-rich syngas while suppressing CO2 emissions.

Solar-powered cars offer a compelling solution to the challenges of conventional transportation, utilizing solar cells to convert sunlight into clean and renewable energy for propulsion. This paper explores the principles, advantages, and challenges of solar cars while examining their evolving landscape in the automotive industry. Solar cars are celebrated for their environmental benefits, offering true zero carbon dioxide emissions, resource conservation, and minimal maintenance. Moreover, they significantly contribute to noise reduction, offering a quieter driving experience. Despite these advantages, solar cars face challenges that hinder their widespread adoption. Weighty solar panels limit driving range, and energy production often falls short of consumption during operation. Charging infrastructure remains a concern, especially in comparison to the convenience of refueling traditional vehicles. However, innovations such as the Lightyear One prototype demonstrate the potential for long-range solar-powered vehicles, while the feasibility of solar hybrid cars is a subject of ongoing discussion. Continuous advancements in solar cell technology, particularly silicon-based cells, hold promise for improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Conclusively, solar-powered cars represent a sustainable and environmentally conscious future for transportation. With research, technological innovation, and global collaboration, solar vehicles have the potential to transition from promising prototypes to practical and accessible alternatives, contributing to a cleaner and greener planet.

Global Carbon Project (GCP) data shows that natural processes have been sequestering atmospheric CO2 on a yearly basis in proportion to how much the atmospheric CO2 concentration has risen above pre-Industrial levels, the so-called CO2 “sink rate”. Here it is argued that the future trajectory of the sink rate has not been adequately addressed, which has led to overestimation of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and thus of global warming. Additionally, use of the CO2 “airborne fraction” concept has led to some misunderstanding regarding how natural processes remove CO2 from the atmosphere, including unrealistic projections of future sink rates. The 20 land models and 10 ocean models used to estimate rates of CO2 removal from the atmosphere produce a wide variety of results. The GCP averages all of these model results together to obtain a best estimate of the yearly CO2 fluxes. Based upon this average, assuming a linearly declining sink rate into the future derived from GCP data, emissions reductions of only 1% per year totaling 39% below 2023 emissions are required over the next 50 years to stabilize atmospheric CO2 near 457 ppm. Assuming the IPCC best estimate of climate sensitivity of 3 deg. C to a hypothetical doubling of atmospheric CO2, this would meet the 2015 Paris Agreement target of less than 2 deg. C of eventual global-average surface warming. But if observation-based estimates of climate sensitivity around 2 deg. C are assumed, then the 1.5 deg. C Paris goal is easily met. These results, though, are very dependent upon the assumed linear decrease of the future sink rates.

The novel activated carbon with excellent properties prepared by plastic waste as a precursor system is an effective way to solve the problem of CO2 emission and solid waste plastic recycling. However, most of the analysis of the performance of this new high-efficiency activated carbon for the adsorption of CO2 in flue gas is only carried out at the level of material characterization, and the performance evaluation in the actual adsorption process is lacking. Therefore, in this study, a two-dimensional adsorption bed model is established using computational fluid dynamics method. And the effects of different adsorption temperature, desorption temperature, inlet flow rate, porosity and mass transfer coefficient on the adsorption and separation performance of CO2 using waste plastic-based activated carbon are discussed. The results show that the CO2 purity and recovery of the new activated carbon adsorbent can reach 43.13% and 96.08%, and the productivity can reach 152.81 kg t-1 h-1 when the desorption temperature is 400 K. By comparing the commercial adsorbent, the new adsorbent used in this study has certain adsorption advantages in terms of recovery and productivity. It can be further proved that waste plastic-based activated carbon can play a role as an efficient regeneration adsorbent at the CO2 capture level, and can promote negative CO2 emission at the same time. The results of this study provide an important reference for the resource utilization of waste plastics and the development of CO2 emission reduction technology.

Abstract TotalEnergies is committed to the goal of sustainability as it targets to achieve NetZero by 2050. One of the levers to carbon intensity reduction is to reduce direct emission from our portfolio and developing carbon sinks. Hence, the plan is to provide carbon storage services which would store equivalent of 50-100Mt/year of CO2 (TotalEnergies, 2023). To realize this objective, the logical step is by building capacity, in terms of skills and projects, to adapt to the new requirements of CO2 injection. This ambition requires developing viable and sustainable surface and downhole equipment design which can meet the challenges of CO2 injection. Our focus is the case of CO2 that is transported in dense phase to the well and then injected into a highly depleted reservoir. Among the challenges associated with the dense phase CO2 injection into a depleted reservoir is the question of compatible completion strings, tubing connections and Downhole Safety Valve (DHSV); which form the primary well barrier, capable of handling potentially extreme low temperatures and rapid swings of temperatures associated with transient conditions of CO2. Thus far, we have proposed credible load cases for completions stress analysis and developed a methodology / guideline for completions design in highly depleted reservoir. Today, we routinely apply it to every project in focus; to incorporate CO2 sequestration in the project development plans. The results of this methodology clarify the specific need(s) for completions design and associated equipment qualifications for CCS applications in highly depleted reservoir environment.

Abstract Geological carbon storage (GCS) is the most popular technique for sequestering CO2. Usually, GCS is modeled using commercial numerical simulators to make CO2 forecasts for mapping CO2 subsurface movement. However, simulators require high computational resources for complex problems. In this paper wavelet and Fourier neural operator (WNO and FNO) based – machine learning models were employed to rapidly forecast the reservoir pressure and CO2 saturation distribution, under fixed injection locations. Two geological models, SACROC and Sleipner, were used to generate CO2 injection datasets. The efficacy of the WNO model was evaluated through CO2 forecasts on the SACROC dataset, while the trained FNO model on the SACROC dataset was "transferred" to make predictions on the Sleipner dataset. The WNO-based ML method was accurate and efficient, such that the overall mean relative errors for pressure and saturation predictions on the test set were 2.21% and 0.84% respectively. More importantly, the WNO-ML algorithm reduced the prediction time by 90%. The overall mean relative errors for pressure and saturation prediction using transfer learning with the FNO algorithm were 2.48% and 1.79% respectively. Additionally, the application of transfer learning reduced the machine learning model training time and data storage requirement by 61% and 45% respectively. Through reduction of the computational time and data storage requirements for CO2 forecasting, transfer learning makes it possible to conduct more detailed and accurate forecasts, which can help to improve the safety and efficiency of CO2 storage projects.

This study investigated characteristics of alkali-activated slags incorporating magnesium oxide (MgO) subjected to CO2 curing. The samples were prepared by adding 2%, 5%, and 10% MgO to the total binder mass. The mixture was activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and cured in a CO2 incubator for 3 days. The compressive strength of the MgO-incorporated CO2-cured alkali-activated slag was higher than that of the conventional alkali-activated slag at all ages up to 28 days. No reduction in the strength was observed over time. The enhanced strength was independent of MgO content. Combined X-ray diffraction with thermogravimetric analysis showed MgO accelerated the alkali activation by dissolving more Ca and Al ions from the slag. CO2 curing supplied carbonate ions and produced calcium carbonate and hydrotalcite. The former aided in achieving a higher level of early age strength and gel pore refinement. Larger amount of the carbonates was formed under high MgO contents, which further enhanced the strength.

This study aims to analyze the determinants that influence the consumers’ disposition to invest in microgrid technology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This research offers valuable insights for policymakers on investors’ motivations to develop strategies to foster microgrid technology adoption through end-user investments leading to a reduction in microgrid high capital cost. The study employed descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses to analyze the responses of a sample of property owners to a quantitative survey. The study examines such variables as strategic alignment, profitability, digitization, renewable energy utilization, CO2 emission reduction, and disaster recovery readiness. The data collected reveal a moderate level of understanding and cost-awareness of microgrid technology among the respondents, with a mean of 2.46 out of 5. Notably, the data highlight the significant influence of strategic alignment with the UAE’s national energy goals on the respondents’ inclination to invest in microgrids, with a strong positive correlation of 0.942 at the 0.01 level (two-tailed). By comparison, profitability and disaster recovery have a comparatively weaker correlation. Furthermore, based on the data collected during this study, it has been determined that there is a strong value added by the microgrid initiatives considering the UAE’s strategic direction and the positive influence of reduced CO2. The regression models used were highly significant at F = 85.690. There is an acceptable level of multicollinearity with VIF values ranging from 1.087 to 2.155. UAE Strategy has low collinearity. UAE Strategy emerges as the only significant predictor of willingness to invest (p < 0.001) in the stepwise regression analysis. The analysis shows that villa and townhouse owners are willing to invest in community microgrid given that it is aligned with UAE strategy and leads to CO2 emissions reduction.

However, the high temperature required for solvent regeneration and the less-than-optimal photothermal conversion efficiency that prevents reaching the necessary regeneration temperature are significant limitations to this approach. In this work, thermomorphic solvents containing dimethylcyclohexylamine, N-methylcyclohexylamine and photothermal nanoparticles were prepared for CO2 capture. Nano carbon black, multi-walled carbon nanotube and carboxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube were used as promoter for photothermal conversion. The experimental results exhibit the high CO2 absorption capacity of 0.1081 g/g solvent for the carboxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube based solvent, and it can be efficiently regenerated under solar irradiation at a low temperature of ∼ 323 K. It is noteworthy that the photothermal material not only raise the solution temperature(∼325 K) during solar irradiation but also boosts the CO2 absorption rate, and leads to a ∼ 20.8 % increase in CO2 absorption capacity during the absorption process. Furthermore, the utilisation of photothermal regeneration for thermomorphic solvents can achieve an efficiency of 78.6 %, with a regeneration heat of 2.35 GJ/t CO2, resulting in an energy consumption reduction of approximately 41.1 % in comparison to 30 wt% monoethanolamine. The photo triggered regeneration of the thermomorphic solvent investigated in this study shows promising potential as an energy-efficient carbon capture technology.

Understanding and predicting CO2 emissions from individual power plants is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study analyzes and forecasts CO2 emissions from an engine-based natural gas-fired power plant in Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ), Bangladesh. This study also presents a rich dataset and ELM-based prediction model for a natural gas-fired plant in Bangladesh. Utilizing a rich dataset of Electricity generation and Gas Consumption, CO2 emissions in tons are estimated based on the measured energy use, and the ELM models were trained on CO2 emissions data from January 2015 to December 2022 and used to forecast CO2 emissions until December 2026. This study aims to improve the understanding and prediction of CO2 emissions from natural gas-fired power plants. While the specific operational strategy of the studied plant is not available, the provided data can serve as a valuable baseline or benchmark for comparison with similar facilities and the development of future research on optimizing operations and CO2 mitigation strategies. The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) modeling method was employed due to its efficiency and accuracy in prediction. The ELM models achieved performance metrics Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), values respectively 3494.46 (<5000), 2013.42 (<2500), and 0.93 close to 1, which falls within the acceptable range. Although natural gas is a cleaner alternative, emission reduction remains essential. This data-driven approach using a Bangladeshi case study provides a replicable framework for optimizing plant operations and measuring and forecasting CO2 emissions from similar facilities, contributing to global climate change.

China's carbon emission trading policy plays a crucial role in achieving both its "3060" dual carbon objectives and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) on climate action. The policy's effectiveness in reducing pollution and mitigating carbon emissions holds significant importance. This paper investigated whether China's carbon emission trading policy affects pollution reduction (PM2.5 and SO2) and carbon mitigation (CO2) in pilot regions, using panel data from 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2005 to 2019 and employing a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model. Furthermore, it analyzed the heterogeneity of carbon market mechanisms and regional variations. Finally, it examined the governance pathways for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation from a holistic perspective. The results indicate that: (1) China's carbon emission trading policy has reduced CO2 emissions by 18% and SO2 emissions by 36% in pilot areas, with an immediate impact on the "carbon mitigation" effect, while the "pollution reduction" effect exhibits a time lag. (2) Higher carbon trading prices lead to stronger "carbon mitigation" effects, and larger carbon market scales are associated with greater "pollution reduction" effects on PM2.5. Governance effects on pollution reduction and carbon mitigation vary among pilot regions: Carbon markets of Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin show significant governance effects in both "pollution reduction" and "carbon mitigation", whereas Guangdong's carbon market exhibits only a "pollution reduction" effect, and Hubei's carbon market demonstrates only a "carbon mitigation" effect. (3) Currently, China's carbon emission trading policy achieves pollution reduction and carbon mitigation through "process management" and "end-of-pipe treatment". This study could provide empirical insights and policy implications for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation, as well as for the development of China's carbon emission trading market.

The marine emission trading system can effectively reduce the overall carbon emissions of shipping industry at the macro level. However, previous studies on the emission reduction of shipping companies did not solve the problem of annual emission allowance allocation of liner companies from the perspective of technical efficiency. In this paper, the zero sum gains data envelopment model (ZSG-DEA model) is used to propose a most efficient emission allowance allocation mode between eight liner companies with high fleet capacity share based on the data in 2021. The main contributions of this study are as followed:(l) finding that large liner companies, which should have more outstanding performance in emission reduction, still have the demand for emission reduction. (2) The effectiveness of ZSG-DEA model for emission allowance allocation in shipping industry is presented, and the most efficient way of allocation for eight liner companies is obtained through case analysis. The CO2 allowance of all the liner companies reach the ZSG-DEA frontier.

Global population growth has influenced further technological and scientific challenges, where the exponential increase in electricity demand stands out. In this context, it is necessary to continue researching alternatives to conventional energy generation to reduce greenhouse emissions. Fuel Cell technology is promising for lowering and storing carbon dioxide emissions in this context. It is a backup system to avoid intermittent problems with wind, solar, or other technologies. Fuel cells correspond to an electrochemical device that converts the chemical energy of a fuel directly into electrical energy. Their main components are the electrodes (anode and cathode), electronically conductive, and electrolyte. In particular, molten carbonate fuel cells use hydrogen as fuel, highlighting their excellent power. However, the high working temperature, close to 650 °C, is a disadvantage due to the reduction of the component’s lifetime. Therefore, for a long-term operation, electrode corrosion behavior must be considered. This thesis aims to study Cu-Ni-Al alloys' microstructure and electrochemical behavior for molten carbonate fuel cells. The metal samples were manufactured using powder metallurgical techniques, such as hot pressing and additive manufacturing. The porosity was analyzed using the Archimedes method. The micro-macrostructure of the samples will be studied before and after exposure to Li2CO3-K2CO3 at 550 °C using surface analysis, such as optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Moreover, gravimetric measurements before and after exposure and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at open circuit potential were used to analyze the corrosion of the anodes in an aerated and controlled environment.

Polyaniline (PANI) provides an attractive organic platform for CO2 electrochemical reduction due to the ability to adsorb CO2 molecules and in providing means to interact with metal nanostructures. In this work, a novel PANI supported copper catalyst has been developed by coupling the interfacial polymerization of PANI and Cu nanoparticles. The hybrid catalyst demonstrates excellent activity towards production of hydrocarbon products including CH4 and C2H4, compared with the use of bare Cu nanoparticles. A faradaic efficiency of 71.8% and a current density of 16.9 mA/cm2 were achieved at ‐0.86V vs. RHE, in contrast to only 22.2% and 1.0 mA/cm2 from the counterpart Cu catalysts. The remarkably enhanced catalytic performance of the hybrid PANI/Cu catalyst can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the PANI underlayer and copper nanoparticles. The PANI favours the adsorption and binding of CO2 molecules via its nitrogen sites to form *CO intermediates, while the Cu/PANI interfaces confine the diffusion or desorption of the *CO intermediates favouring their further hydrogenation or carbon‐carbon coupling to form hydrocarbon products. This work provides insights into the formation of hydrocarbon products on PANI‐modified Cu catalysts, which may guide the development of conducting polymer‐metal catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.

Abstract Compact, and lightweight solvent-based CO2-capture technology is developed. The technology has undergone pilot-scale demonstration and extensive testing. The aim of this research is to systematically quantify the effects on the process variables associated with pressurized CO2-capture of flue gas streams or other process streams, encompassing both low and high CO2 concentrations. The objective is to verify the technology and to obtain the data necessary for the design of a large-scale demonstration plant, capable of capturing CO2 under real operational conditions. Results from four months of operation of the pilot are presented. The novelty of the technology lies in the CO2 absorption aspect of a solvent-based capture technology, utilizing static mixers and separators for contacting the gas and liquid phases. Consequently, the pilot scale absorption unit has been integrated into an existing solvent regeneration system. The solvent utilized in the demonstration is a 30 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA) solution. Pressurized capture is benchmarked against previous research conducted using the same regeneration unit but previously done with a conventional atmospheric absorption column. The research project has performed extensive testing under atmospheric conditions, yielding substantial amounts of comparable data between conventional atmospheric CO2 capture and the new technology both at atmospheric and pressurized conditions. The results show a greater than 95% CO2 capture rate both for low (2.5 vol%) and high CO2 concentrations (10 vol%). Further, the testing shows significant improvement of mass transfer of CO2 between the phases, and reduced size requirements both from a physical aspect related to dimensions of gas piping, but also with regards to the size of the absorption equipment (i.e., Mixer, separator, and piping in between those two elements). The results obtained have been sufficient to design a large-scale demonstration plant, and dimensions, size, cost, energy requirement and OPEX considerations of a full-scale system will be presented. The novelty of the technology revolves around developing a compact CO2-capture system that can be retrofitted into facilities that has existing emissions points, but most importantly, being able to enable CO2 capture on offshore installations that is not suitable for conventional technologies. The technology is likely to provide a significant cost reduction from a CAPEX perspective due to the reduced size and weight. Capturing CO2 in a compact way at pressurized conditions is likely to add great benefits. Gas turbines manufacturers are developing methods of exploiting the pressurized exhaust after the compression stage upstream expansion to facilitate high pressure CO2-capture, while preserving the energy. The presented technology can be an enabler in this market and bring down cost, size and energy consumption for gas fired power production with CCS.

In the case of Carbon Geological Storage (CGS), the wettability is one of the main parameters controlling the CO2 injection capacity and CO2 plume movement, which affects the safety of long-term CO2 storage. A full evaluation of this parameter is essential for risk evaluation and storage capacity estimation. The objective of this study was to investigate the wettability changes of shales from the Chang 7 Formation in the Ordos Basin by exposing the samples to ScCO2/brine for 10/20/30/and 60 days. The mineral composition, pore structure, chemical functional groups, and surface morphology changes of the shale were analyzed using x-ray diffractometer (XRD), low-temperature nitrogen adsorption (LN-N2), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the solid-drop method was used to measure the contact angle of shale samples at different times of ScCO2 soaking. The results show that after 60 days of continuous ScCO2 soaking, the shale water contact angle and chemical group peak spectrum generally show an increasing trend, which is caused by the reduction of carbonate and clay mineral content. The prolonged time of ScCO2 soaking weakens the shale's water wettability and reduces the water-locking effect (water has a sealing effect in the pore channel of the reservoir), capillary force, and the height of CO2 sequestration columns, which is favorable for shale gas extraction (a method of extracting natural gas from shale rock by CO2 fracturing), but it may increase the CO2 geological leakage risk. The results have important implications for regulating the change of shale water wettability, and this study can also better provide theoretical references for Carbon Geological Storage programs.

Modern ironmaking process relies significantly on fossil-related fuels, which ultimately results in the enormous CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. Biomass of plant origin, as a carbon-neutral energy source, has been considered as an alternative to fossil-based reducing agents such as coke. This study aims to investigate the potential of three woody biomass waste derivatives produced from biomass waste pyrolysis and gasification, namely charcoal, bio-oil, and bio-syngas, as the reducing agents in blast furnace. A model based on heat and mass balance and Gibbs free energy minimisation is proposed to simulate an ironmaking process with assistance of these derivatives. The effects of specific composition of biomass waste derivatives on process operation, CO2 emissions, and coke replacement are explored. Also the effects of H2-rich gas produced from biomass waste gasification on the blast furnace operation are estimated. Results indicate that reactions of woody biomass waste derivatives in blast furnace are complex and greatly dependent on composition. When charcoal has a higher carbon content, lower CO2 concentration is found from the top gas. The higher content of hydrogen in bio-oil will inhibit further reduction in CO2 emissions. Bio-syngas with H2/CO ratio of 1.3 proves to have a remarkable potential to reduce CO2 emissions. From the aspects of available biomass waste resources across the world, woody biomass waste derivatives as reducing agents are more suitable for countries with the limited pig iron production. This study provides a reference on the future of moving forward the decarbonised ironmaking by using woody biomass waste derivatives.

Abstract This study explores the feasibility of CO2 transportation and injection for Korea's 1st large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in a depleted gas reservoir in the East Sea, South Korea. In this study, the necessity of heating CO2 at the offshore platform is examined. Operating envelope of the CO2 injector in light of near-wellbore Joule-Thompson (JT) cooling and hydrate formation is also investigated. The study informs the basis of facility design to attain the CO2 injection target. Transient thermo-hydraulic simulations using OLGA were conducted to establish the safe operating envelope and optimal injection strategy. The study considered re-using the existing flowlines, offshore platforms, and wells. Two development strategies were considered, with or without heating CO2 at the offshore platform. Two reservoir pressures were considered: early life and late life. Hydrate formation risk in flowlines, well and near-wellbore areas were assessed. This study assesses various methods to mitigate hydrate formation in CO2 injection wells within CCS projects. Each tested concept has distinct advantages and drawbacks, emphasizing the need for optimizing transport and injection systems to minimize energy consumption during steady injection. The primary discovery indicates that implementing an early injection strategy is crucial for preventing hydrate formation in CO2 injection wells. The study reveals that heating CO2 during the initial injection phase proves ineffective in averting near-wellbore hydrate formation, mainly due to substantial heat dissipation in the subsea flowline. Furthermore, even with heating, fluid temperatures near the sandface drop below freezing, creating favorable conditions for hydrate formation. This approach enhances the economic viability of CCS projects by eliminating the need for costly mitigation methods, rendering them more financially appealing. This study addresses CO2 injection challenges in highly depleted reservoirs for geologic sequestration. Our systematic approach optimizes transport and injection systems, thereby improving CCS project economics and making depleted fields more attractive for CO2 storage. Our results provide valuable insights into the feasibility of large-scale CCS in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, offering cost-effective hydrate mitigation methods, supporting viable CCS solutions, and contributing to global greenhouse gas reduction efforts.

Without belittling our industry’s work to arrest climate change, the fact remains that relentless global efforts to secure energy during the past 4 decades have led to only a 7% reduction in the contribution of fossil fuels to the global energy supply. In light of the historic outcomes of COP28 and the stringent agreement of 198 countries to steer away from fossil fuels, it is evident that today’s oil and gas industry is at a crossroads and in an unprecedented race with time to address the trilemma to develop a progressive multitier energy model to balance transitioning to a low-carbon industry with maintaining production and fortifying its commitment to a sustainable future. Empowering, leveraging, and capitalizing on the current investments of our industry in the rapidly developing technologies that are revolutionizing both the renewable and fossil-fuel landscapes are exigently and prudently needed to reach this cornerstone goal. These technologies—such as carbon capture, use, and storage; winds; hydrogen; bioenergy; and geothermal—form more than 28% of the total energy consumption targeted to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 and have a close affinity to the existing resources of the oil and gas industry. Deepwater offshore developments have always been the forefront projects of the industry. After about a decade of fragile outlook and waning investment in these ventures, the trend is showing a dynamic rise since 2022 based on the number of sanctioned projects worldwide and the associated annual capital of more than $200 billion. This is a remarkable affirmation of the resilience of these assets and the confidence in a greener, safer, and more cost-effective future of the industry in general. Rigorous engineering remains the key platform to accomplish the dizzying array of complex work on a daily basis and the linchpin in elevating the performance of deepwater projects from acquisition to abandonment. Opportunity still abounds for the operators of these assets to thrive and endure for the upcoming decades through advancing engineering prowess, bolstering their assets’ designs and operability, and collaborating with counterparts on potential synergies. These are prudent measures to appraise and invest in well-grounded solutions in order to harness the full potential of deepwater developments and improve their operational and overall efficiencies.

Electrification applications in transport and energy supply can significantly reduce carbon emissions. The impact of electrification on carbon emissions reduction varies across countries with different development profiles. In developed countries, with the increase of renewable resources usage in electricity production, the per capita CO2 emissions decrease. For example, Germany increased its share of electricity production from renewable sources from 6.2% to 44%, and its per capita CO2 emissions dropped from 11.2 t to 8.1t. While in developing countries, the per capita CO2 emissions are still increasing with the increase of electrification level. For example, India increased its degree of electrification from 58% to 99%, and its per capita CO2 emissions increased from 0.9 t to 1.9 t. This paper first used LCA data to compare the Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of electric vehicles and fuel vehicles and GHG emissions of electricity plants from different energy sources. Then, this paper used Linear regression to determine how close between electrification and climate change. This research aims to identify the potential of electrification to achieve urbanization and carbon neutrality, as there are few discussions regarding the combination of these three topics at present. This research can confirm the benefit of electrification in reducing carbon emissions, which can promote the broad application of electrification and its development.

Abstract The role of Carbon Capture, Use, and Storage (CCUS) in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for achieving global climate targets. Brazil, as a significant emitter, is actively pursuing CCUS projects and the state of Rio de Janeiro, with its high emissions of industrial activities, presents an opportunity for establishing a CCUS hub. The potential storage reservoir, São Tomé Deep Saline Formation, located in the Campos Basin, offers favorable characteristics for CO2 storage. This srtdy aims to estimate the CO2 storage capacity, perform uncertainty analysis, and comprehensive risk assessments for the Sao Tome reservoir. The methodology involves mapping potential storage reservoirs, 3D geological modeling, and flow simulation to evaluate injectivity, storage potential, containment safety, and monitoring strategies. The results demonstrate a storage capacity of approximately 1 Gt of CO2, injectivity of 1.5 MMt C02/yr/well, and low leakage risk. However, further evaluation is required, including petrophysical characterization and geomechanical data. The proposal includes drilling a new well to acquire additional information and support more robust modeling. The establishment of a CCUS hub in Rio de Janeiro would bring economic, social, and environmental benefits, attracting companies seeking environmentally friendly solutions and facilitating the development of the shallow-water industry. To achieve the Net Zero Scenario by 2050, CCUS plays a crucial role in emissions reduction, and the Sao Tome reservoir presents significant potential for CO2 storage. Continued evaluation and data acquisition are necessary to ensure the feasibility of large-scale CO2 injection projects. The establishment of a CCUS hub in Rio de Janeiro would position the region as a center of environmental responsibility and attract investment and innovation in the energy sector.

Excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction activity has been demonstrated by transition metals and nitrogen-codoped carbon (M–N–C) catalysts, especially for transition-metal porphyrin (MTPP)-based catalysts. In this work, we propose to use one-step low-temperature pyrolysis of the isostructural MTPP-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and electrochemical in situ reduction strategies to obtain a series of hybrid catalysts of Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) and MTPP, named Co NPs/MTPP (M = Fe, Co, and Ni). The in situ introduction of Co NPs can efficiently enhance the electrocatalytic ability of MTPP (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) to convert CO2 to CO, particularly for FeTPP. Co NPs/FeTPP endowed a high CO faradaic efficiency (FECOmax = 95.5%) in the H cell, and the FECO > 90.0% is in the broad potential range of −0.72 to −1.22 VRHE. In addition, the Co NPs/FeTPP achieved 145.4 mA cm–2 at a lower potential of −0.70 VRHE with an FECO of 94.7%, and the CO partial currents increased quickly to reach 202.2 mA cm–2 at −0.80 VRHE with an FECO of 91.6% in the flow cell. It is confirmed that Co NPs are necessary for hybrid catalysts to get superior electrocatalytic activity; Co NPs also can accelerate H2O dissociation and boost the proton supply capacity to hasten the proton-coupled electron-transfer process, effectively adjusting the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates.

The study utilizes a GIS-Based Multi-Criteria Analysis to evaluate the viability of solar, wind, and biomass energy in Iraq, focusing on enhancing the nation's energy independence and meeting international climate objectives. Detailed spatial analysis revealed specific zones suited for the efficient installation of energy power plants. Zones with an energy surplus factor of less than 0.2 are deemed not viable for development, whereas regions with factors less than 0.4 are ideal for harnessing solar, wind, and biomass resources. Furthermore, zones with surplus factors greater than 0.6 are highly recommended for energy projects. Notably, the results show that strategic development of these zones can cater to between 45% and 68% of the country total energy demand, potentially reducing the CO2 footprint by 0.5. Moreover, with an increase in the construction threshold, the CO2 reduction potential has shown a decrease to 1.29E+08 tones, particularly evident in areas with rigorous construction standards. A plateau in reduction figures is observed once the construction threshold surpasses 3.5, stabilizing between 2.5E+07 tones. As the threshold exceeds 5, a further stabilization is noted, consistently around 2.17E+07 tones, persisting even when the threshold approaches 8. The outcomes underscores the critical role of strategic zoning in maximizing renewable energy potential, highlighting pathways for the country to achieve energy self-sufficiency and make significant strides in climate goals.

Abstract Microbiologically influenced corrosion has become a predominant cause of pipeline and equipment failure in oil and gas fields. This research examines the corrosion behavior of steels with varying chromium contents in simulated shale gas formation water environments. Weight loss testing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Focused Ion Beam (FIB), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were employed. The findings suggest that an elevated Cr content in steel results in a gradual reduction in its uniform corrosion rate in a CO2-SRB coexistence environment. This can be primarily attributed to the significant distribution of Cr content throughout the entire product film, including both biofilm and corrosion products, thereby enhancing the product film's protectiveness. Additionally, the competitive corrosion between CO2 and SRB, as well as the influence mechanism of Cr on corrosion, were discussed.

With China’s rapid industrialization and urbanization in the process of socio-economic development, the extensive use of energy has resulted in a large amount of CO2 emissions, which puts great pressure on China’s carbon emission reduction task. Through multivariate socio-economic data, this paper proposes an extraction and screening method of multivariate variables based on land-use types, and the downscaled spatial decomposition of carbon emissions at different scales was carried out by using the spatial lag model (SLM). This paper makes up for the shortcomings of previous studies, such as an insufficient modeling scale, simple modeling variables, limited spatio-temporal span of spatial decomposition, and no consideration of geographical correlation. Based on the results of the spatial decomposition of carbon emissions, this paper explores the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon emissions at different scales. The results showed that SLM is capable of downscaling the spatialization of carbon emissions with high precision, and the continuity of the decomposition results at the provincial scale is stronger, while the differences of the decomposition results at the municipal scale are more obvious within the municipal units. In terms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of CO2 emissions, carbon emissions at both scales showed a significant positive correlation. The dominant spatial correlation types are “Low–Low” at the provincial level, and “Low–Low” and “High–High” at the municipal level. The smaller spatial scope is more helpful to show the geographic dependence and geographic differences of China’s carbon emissions. The findings of this paper will help deepen the understanding of the spatial and temporal changes of carbon emissions in China. They will provide a scientific basis for the formulation of feasible carbon emission reduction policies.

With growing concerns about air pollution and global warming effects, the emissions of NH3 and greenhouse gases (GHGs) have become significant issues in the pig production industry. In order to discover whether optimizing manure removal strategies could alter the manure decomposition process and benefit the reduction of gas emissions, a scale model approach was used to quantify the gas emissions under controlled conditions. This study compared the gas emission reduction potential of two classic manure removal systems (scraper and pull-plug system) in three manure removal strategies: scraper-I (retaining manure for 24 h), scraper-II (retaining manure for 8 and 16 h) and pull-plug (retaining manure for 44 days). Fresh urine and faeces collected from a gestation sow house were applied to the scale models and then removed through the manure removal systems. The concentrations of gases (NH3, CH4, CO2, and N2O) within the scale model and removed slurry samples were collected and analysed (pH, electric conductivity, dry matter, total nitrogen, total ammonium nitrogen and total carbon). The results showed that emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O from scraper-I were on average 54%, 56% and 25% lower than those from scraper-II, and 71%, 67% and 6% lower than those from pull-plug treatment, respectively. The GHGs emission rates (as CO2-equivalents) of scraper-I and scraper-II were 52% and 26.3% lower than that of pull-plug treatment respectively (P < 0.01). The emissions of NH3 displayed a temporary peak during each application of urine and removal of manure. In pull-plug treatment, the concentrations of NH3, CH4, and CO2 exponentially increased between Day 39 and Day 41. The nitrogen content, both total nitrogen and total ammonium nitrogen, within the slurry under the scraper system exhibited lower values compared to those from the pull-plug system. Conversely, the total carbon content was higher in the former system. Caution is warranted in extrapolating results to full-scale pig housing, given study limitations (e.g. small scale, mimicked scraper activity, no animals, etc.). Nevertheless, the conclusions and findings of this study provide fundamental data for understanding gas emissions from pig house manure management. This insight can guide the design and daily operations of low-emission manure removal systems in gestation sow houses.

Among the challenges that wastewater treatment plants face in the path towards sustainability, reducing CO2 emissions and decrease the amount of waste highlight. Within these wastes, those that can cause eutrophication, such as nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) are of great concern. Herein we study a novel process to concentrate nutrients via membrane technology. In particular, we propose the use of forward osmosis, applying the carbonated solvent which contains the CO2 captured from the biogas stream as draw solution. This carbonated solvent has a high potential osmotic pressure, which can be used in forward osmosis to concentrate the nutrients stream. To this end, we present the results of an experimental plan specifically designed and performed to evaluate two main parameters: (1) nutrients concentration; and (2) water recovery. The process designed involves pH adjustment, membrane filtration to separate solids, pH reduction and forward osmosis concentration of nutrients. With this process, concentrations factor for nutrients in between 2 and 2.5 and water recovery of approximately 50 % with water flux of 7 to 8 L/(m2h) can be achieved.

Copper-based materials exhibit significant potential as catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction, owing to their capacity to generate multicarbon hydrocarbons. The molecular functionalization of Cu electrodes represents a simple yet powerful strategy for improving the intrinsic activity of these materials by favoring specific reaction pathways through the creation of tailored microenvironments around the surface active sites. However, despite its success, comprehensive mechanistic insights derived from experimental techniques are often limited, leaving the active role of surface modifiers inconclusive. In this work, we show that N-heterocyclic carbene-carbodiimide-functionalized Cu catalysts display a remarkable activity for multicarbon product formation, surpassing bare Cu electrodes by more than an order of magnitude. These hybrid catalysts operate efficiently using an electrolyzer equipped with a gas diffusion electrode, achieving a multicarbon product selectivity of 58% with a partial current density of ca. −80 mA cm–2. We found that the activity for multicarbon product formation is closely linked to the surface charge that accumulates during electrocatalysis, stemming from surface intermediate buildup. Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we elucidated the role of the molecular additives in altering the electronic structure of the Cu electrodes, promoting the stabilization of surface CO. Additionally, in situ Raman measurements established the identity of the reaction intermediates that accumulate during electrocatalysis, indicating preferential CO binding on Cu step sites, known for facilitating C–C coupling. This study underscores the significant potential of molecular surface modifications in developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, highlighting surface charge as a pivotal descriptor of multicarbon product activity.

As New Zealand moves towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050, multiple factors must be considered including increased electrical load due to electrification, variability of renewable energy generators, required storage capacity, system economics and limitations on grid transmission capacity. Complex and region-specific interactions between the various design choices involved are likely to require an understanding of a range of optimal and near-optimal designs for proposed micro-grid systems as opposed to a single optimal point. This work develops a novel multiscale optimization algorithm for optimization from a univariate capacity optimization approach to a multivariate one. This enhanced algorithm is applied to a grid-connected hybrid energy system consisting of local wind and solar generation, battery storage, and a limited grid connection for industrial and residential loads. This analysis is repeated for current 2023 and forecasted net zero 2050 grid conditions. Development of local generation allows for a 36.8% reduction of levelized cost of electricity in the 2023 case and a 38.6% reduction in the 2050 case. This results in a projected reduction of 19920 tonnes of CO2/yr. The algorithm and methodology developed are broadly applicable to optimization of next-generation energy grids.

Abstract There is a growing desire in the offshore oil and gas industry to lower CO2 emissions from operations, especially in FPSOs and FLNG units. One method to lower CO2 emission is to reduce power consumption by improving the cooling system so that it utilizes colder water from deep sea. Traditionally, Sea Water Intake Risers (SWIRs), which are usually made of reinforced rubber hoses, are used to supply water from water depths up to 150m to the topside, resulting in an in-take temperature of at least 15°C. Nowadays, many operators have been trying to reach colder water (5-7°C) with target SWIR depths up to 700 m in order to support emission reduction efforts. However, there are many design and material restrictions to achieve this goal. Therefore, this paper focuses on the feasibility for steel and HDPE SWIR configurations for deep sea applications (up to 700m). Conducting a site-specific feasibility assessment at early design stage plays an important role in selecting an optimum SWIR configuration. The main pipe of the SWIRs is generally made of reinforced rubber, steel, or high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The SWIRs are installed in a free hanging configuration at the keel or on the sides of the FPSO. Their design can be challenging for deep water applications due to harsh environmental effects (i.e., wave and current). Interference with adjacent structures such as production risers or mooring lines can make their design even more complicated. In order to investigate the feasibility of 350 m and 700 m SWIRs, nonlinear finite element simulations are performed using HDPE and steel pipes for a conceptual field. The steel SWIRs may provide more confidence in long term reliability as steel is a conventional material for dynamic pipelines (e.g., production risers), but can lead to weight and fabrication constraints for deep water applications. HDPE is neutrally buoyant and eliminates weight restrictions but is also prone to creep, large displacements, and connection challenges. Today, there are many SWIRs in service, operating up to 150 m water depth and their design and operational requirements are well known by the oil and gas industry. Pumping sea water at depths greater than 150 m is a significant advancement for the industry as deeper SWIRs provide colder water and further reduction in the CO2 emission of FPSO's cooling systems. This paper focuses on the challenges and design limits for deep SWIRs (350 m and 700m) made of steel or HDPE.

A dinucleating 1,8-naphthyridine ligand featuring fluorene-9,9-diyl-linked phosphino side arms (PNNPFlu) was synthesized and used to obtain the cationic dicopper complexes 2, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-Ph)][NTf2]; [NTf2] = bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide, 6, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-CCPh)][NTf2], and 3, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-OtBu)][NTf2]. Complex 3 reacted with diboranes to afford dicopper μ-boryl species (4, with μ-Bcat; cat = catecholate and 5, with μ-Bpin; pin = pinacolate) that are more reactive in C(sp)–H bond activations and toward activations of CO2 and CS2, compared to dicopper μ-boryl complexes supported by a 1,8-naphthyridine-based ligand with di(pyridyl) side arms. The solid-state structures and DFT analysis indicate that the higher reactivities of 4 and 5 relate to changes in the coordination sphere of copper, rather than to perturbations on the Cu–B bonding interactions. Addition of xylyl isocyanide (CNXyl) to 4 gave 7, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-Bcat)(CNXyl)][NTf2], demonstrating that the lower coordination number at copper is chemically significant. Reactions of 4 and 5 with CO2 yielded the corresponding dicopper borate complexes (8, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-OBcat)][NTf2]; 9, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-OBpin)][NTf2]), with 4 demonstrating catalytic reduction in the presence of excess diborane. Related reactions of 4 and 5 with CS2 provided insertion products 10, {[(PNNPFlu)Cu2]2[μ-S2C(Bcat)2]}[NTf2]2, and 11, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ,κ2-S2CBpin)][NTf2], respectively. These products feature Cu–S–C–B linkages analogous to those of proposed CO2 insertion intermediate.

Water availability is a limiting factor for plant production, especially in Brazilian semi-arid regions. The main aim of the study was to investigate the physiological effects of drought during the fruiting stage of watermelon cultivation. A completely randomized block design with four replications and six treatments varied by the number of lateral drip tapes (1 or 2) and the duration of drought stress (0, 4, and 8 days) was used. The following parameters were evaluated: relative chlorophyll content, relative leaf water content, electrolyte leakage, CO2 assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO2 concentration, leaf temperature, transpiration (E), water use efficiency (WUE), carboxylation efficiency (CE), yield, thickness, diameter, length, and fruit °brix, at 4 and 8 days of drought. Drought negatively affected photosynthesis, particularly in treatments with a single dripper and 4 days of drought, resulting in reductions of up to 60% in A, 68% in gs, 44% in E, 58% in WUE, and 59% in CE, but did not have a significant effect on watermelon yield after 4 or 8 days of irrigation. It was concluded that drought influences the physiological responses of watermelon plants, mainly in reducing photosynthesis, but does not drastically affect fruit productivity in short periods of stress.

The upgrading of biogas to value-added syngas through bi-reforming is of enormous significance. The mechanochemical method was adopted to prepare a range of layered double hydroxide-derived bimetallic Ni-Ga catalysts, and the as-prepared catalysts were employed in the bi-reforming of biogas. Comprehensive characterization was carried out to analyze the fresh or spent catalysts. 10Ni10Ga/MgAlO catalyst exhibits high initial catalytic activity in terms of CH4/CO2 conversion (∼96 %/66 %) and satisfying stability up to 120 h without significant deactivation, at 800 ℃ and WHSV = 30,960 mL/g/h. 10Ni10Ga/MgAlO catalyst with direct-reduction pretreatment of catalyst precursor exhibits more homogeneously dispersed active metal sites, which facilitates the dissociation of CH4. Meanwhile, 10Ni10Ga/MgAlO catalyst with electron-rich Ni species, as well as moderately strong and strong basic sites, promotes the CO2 activation, the combined effects result in high initial catalytic activity. In addition, the interaction between active metal site and MgAlO composite oxide, combined with the potential reversible phase transition between Ni3Ga and Ni3GaCx, result into satisfying anti-sintering and anti-coking performance of 10Ni10Ga/MgAlO catalyst, respectively.

Damask rose is an important essential oil crop. In the present study, plants were subjected to three different water deficit levels (70, 40, and 10% available water content) for two periods (June–October). Plant phenology, growth, essential oil yield, gas exchange features, membrane stability and major antioxidant defense elements were monitored across two years. Soil water deficit was related to quicker completion of the growth cycle (up to 7.4 d), and smaller plants (up to 49.7%). Under these conditions, biomass accumulation was jointly constrained by decreased leaf area, chlorophyll content, CO2 intake, and photosynthetic efficiency (up to 82.8, 56.9, 27.3 and 68.2%, respectively). The decrease in CO2 intake was driven by a reduction in stomatal conductance (up to 41.2%), while the decrease in leaf area was mediated by reductions in both number of leaves, and individual leaf area (up to 54.3, and 64.0%, respectively). Although the reactive oxygen species scavenging system was activated (i.e., proline accumulation, and enhanced activity of three antioxidant enzymes) by water deficit, oxidative stress symptoms were still apparent. These effects were amplified, as soil water deficit became more intense. Notably, the adverse effects of water deficit were generally less pronounced when plants had been exposed to water severity during the preceding year. Therefore, exposure to water deficit elicited plant tolerance to future exposure. This phenotypic response was further dependent on the water deficit level. At more intense soil water deficit across the preceding year, plants were less vulnerable to water deficit during the subsequent one. Therefore, our results reveal a direct link between water deficit severity and plant tolerance to future water stress challenges, providing for the first time evidence for stress memory in damask rose.

The study was conducted during 2021–22 with a view to analyze the carbon neutrality and sustainability of Kelappaji College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology (KCAET) campus. It was done for proposing and implementing sector-wise adaptation and mitigation strategies to develop KCAET campus of Malappuram district in Kerala as a “Carbon Neutral Campus”. A carbon emission and sequestration analysis in the sectors of food consumption, transportation, energy, waste and AFOLU (Agriculture, Forest and Other Land Use) was done. The required data were obtained by conducting various surveys, and the corresponding emission factors were taken from available literatures. Carbon emission and sequestration of each sector was calculated as the product of the emission factor and activity data. The total carbon emission from the campus was found to be 522.086 CO2 eq.t and the total sequestration from the campus was 177.2 CO2 eq.t. Since the carbon emission is higher than carbon sequestration, it can be inferred that the campus is not carbon neutral. Strategies for achieving and maintaining carbon neutrality through reduction in emissions, improving stock of carbon and creating carbon credits/reserves need to be adopted. Since the major emission is from transportation and use of fuels, energy efficient methods to save energy and switching to renewable energy sources to bring down the emissions from energy consumption need to be implemented.

Microenvironment regulation of M‐N4 single‐atom catalysts (SACs) is a promising way to tune their catalytic properties toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. However, strategies that can effectively introduce functional groups around the M‐N4 sites through strong covalent bonding and under mild reaction conditions are highly desired. Taking the hydrophilic Ni‐N4 SAC as a representative, we report herein a [2+1] cycloaddition reaction between Ni‐N4 and in‐situ generated difluorocarbene (F2C:), and enable the surface fluorocarbonation of Ni‐N4, resulting in the formation of a super‐hydrophobic Ni‐N4‐CF2 catalyst. Meanwhile, the mild reaction conditions allow Ni‐N4‐CF2 to inherit both the electronic and structural configuration of the Ni‐N4 sites from Ni‐N4. Enhanced electrochemical CO2‐to‐CO Faradaic efficiency above 98% is achieved in a wide operating potential window from −0.7 V to −1.3 V over Ni‐N4‐CF2. In‐situ spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that a highly hydrophobic microenvironment formed by the −CF2− group repels asymmetric H‐bonded water at the electrified interface, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction and promoting CO production. This work highlights the advantages of [2+1] cycloaddition reactions on the covalent modification of N‐doped carbon‐supported catalysts.

To cope with the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental problems, the transformation from traditional energy to renewable energy is urgent. Solar-driven thermochemical conversion of CO2 and H2O into renewable fuels technology provides a favorable path for alternative energy. However, the temperature/pressure swing required for the reduction and oxidation steps during thermochemical process incurs irreversible energy losses and severe material stresses. Moreover, the two-step redox cycle mode cannot achieve a continuous fuel production in the reactor. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel design of thermochemical reactor integrated with heat recovery for continuous production of renewable fuels. In this design, an oxygen-conducting ceria membrane is employed to conduct oxygen ions, electrons and vacancies induced by the oxygen chemical potential gradient to achieve an isothermal and continuous splitting of CO2 and H2O. At the fuel production side, a counter-flow and tube-in-tube alumina reticulate porous ceramic filling heat exchange design is developed to recover the sensible heat of gas products and excessive reactants. In addition, a comprehensive model is developed by coupling the computational dynamics of flow, radiation, conduction and convection, and is solved by the Monte Carlo method coupled with ANSYS FLUENT software through User-defined Functions. Results indicate that the integrating membrane reactor/heat recovery design can not only realize continuous production of renewable fuels, but also recover sensible heat of gas products, which is beneficial for conversion of solar energy to chemical energy. Optimizing heat recovery design can help reactor achieve a solar-to-fuel efficiency of 10.58%. Moreover, if the theoretical CO2 conversion rate could be achieved, the solar-to-fuel efficiency of reactor can reach as high as 40.43%, which means that such a reactor design has a huge potential in conversion of solar energy into renewable fuels.

Draining peatlands to create agricultural land has been the norm in Europe, but in the context of climate change and the loss of biodiversity, these rich ecosystems may reactivate their functions as greenhouse gas sinks and retreat spaces for animals and plants. Against this background, the National Moor Rewetting Strategy was put into effect in Germany in 2023, together with the Natural Climate Protection Action Plan. This article examines the methodology of peatland rewetting from scientific, administrative, social, and technical perspectives. The article focuses on an example of moor rewetting in central Germany: the Rathsbruch moor near the municipality of Zerbst, Saxony-Anhalt. To illustrate the importance of rewetting projects for degraded peatlands, five scenarios with different target soil water levels were considered, and the associated greenhouse gas emissions were calculated for a period of five years. For the planning solution, an estimate of the medium-to-long-term development of the habitat types was made based on current use and the dynamics typical of the habitat. The results for the Rathsbruch moor area showed that increasing the water level in steps of 1, 0.8, or 0.5 m has no significant influence on reducing the CO2 emissions situation, while a depth of 0.3 m has a slight influence. When the water was raised to 0.1 m below the surface (Scenario 5), a significant CO2 reduction was observed. The calculated avoided CO2 costs due to environmental damage show that the environmental benefits multiply with every decimeter of water level increase. The rising groundwater levels and extensification favor the establishment of local biotopes. This means that two of the biggest man-made problems (extinction of species and climate change) can be reduced. Therefore, this research is applicable to the development and planning of recultivation work at municipal and regional levels in Germany and beyond within the framework of EU restoration policy.

HKUST−1 is an MOF adsorbent industrially produced in powder form and thus requires a post-shaping process for use as an adsorbent in fixed-bed separation processes. HKUST−1 is also sensitive to moisture, which degrades its crystalline structure. In this work, HKUST−1, in the form of crystalline powder, was extruded into pellets using a hydrophobic polymeric binder to improve its moisture stability. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) was used for that purpose. The subsequent HKUST−1/TPU extrudate was then compared to HKUST−1/PLA extrudates synthesized with more hydrophilic polymer: polylactic acid (PLA), as the binder. The characterization of the composites was determined via XRD, TGA, SEM-EDS, and an N2 adsorption isotherm analysis. Meanwhile, the gas-separation performances of HKUST−1/TPU were investigated and compared with HKUST−1/PLA from measurements of CO2 and CH4 isotherms at three different temperatures, up to 10 bars. Lastly, the moisture stability of the composite materials was investigated via an aging analysis during storage under humid conditions. It is shown that HKUST−1’s crystalline structure was preserved in the HKUST−1/TPU extrudates. The composites also exhibited good thermal stability under 523 K, whilst their textural properties were not significantly modified compared with the pristine HKUST−1. Furthermore, both extrudates exhibited larger CO2 and CH4 adsorption capacities in comparison to the pristine HKUST−1. After three months of storage under atmospheric humid conditions, CO2 adsorption capacities were reduced to only 10% for HKUST−1/TPU, whereas reductions of about 25% and 54% were observed for HKUST−1/PLA and the pristine HKUST−1, respectively. This study demonstrates the interest in shaping MOF powders by extrusion using a hydrophobic thermoplastic binder to operate adsorbents with enhanced moisture stability in gas-separation columns.

The extensive usage of epoxy resin (EP) is facing the head-scratching challenge of high fire hazard. As such, the in-situ assembly of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) nanocubes on electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanoflakes is performed to acquire the heterojunction of PG@UIO. The corresponding role and behavior in flame retardance are explored in detail. By adding 2.0 wt% PG@UIO, the reductions in peak heat release rate, total heat release, peak smoke production rate, peak CO yield, peak CO2 yield reach 49.2%, 44.3%, 56.1%, 57.7% and 51.3%. The in-situ volatiles analysis points out the reductions of 35.1%, 29.4%, 50.8%, 32.5% in the maximal intensities of aromatic compounds, ethers, CO and HCN. The mechanical interlocking area between PG@UIO nanostructures and EP molecular chains contributes to the enhanced mechanical performances. Specifically, by adding 2.0 wt% PG@UIO, the flexural strength is increased by 50.3%. This work enables a new paradigm for fabricating fire-safe polymer composites with the judicious design of MOFs based flame retardant.

Abstract The Subsea High-Pressure Separation, in this paper named as SHPS, is an innovative subsea separation technology designed to separate gas with high-CO2 content from the reservoir-produced fluid at the seabed. This technology operates under high-pressure conditions and utilizes centrifugal pumps to directly reinject the separated gas stream back into the reservoir. By removing the excess of gas with high CO2 content, the SHPS technology enables efficient separation and contributes to emissions intensity reduction, making it a promising system for carbon capture. The primary objective of the SHPS is to debottleneck the topside gas processing plant and extend the oil production plateau by reducing the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) of the oil stream that reaches the FPSO (Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading) facility. Additionally, the technology addresses challenges posed by high GOR, CO2 content, and productivity index (PI) in ultra-deep water offshore reservoirs, particularly in the Brazilian Pre-salt. This paper provides an overview of the rigorous qualification program developed for the SHPS technology, in accordance with API 17N and 17Q standards. The technological roadmap includes successful completion of experimental tests, early engagement with subsea companies, and a de-risking phase focused on pump design and testes with dense gas as well as dynamic simulations. The remaining phases involve the construction, integration, installation, and operational testing of the SHPS system in the challenging Pre-salt environment, ultimately leading to its qualification as a transformative innovation. Throughout the development of the SHPS, valuable insights have been gained, emphasizing the importance of a clear vision, engaged multidisciplinary project team, market validation, prototyping, testing, risk mitigation, scalability, and adaptability. In conclusion, the SHPS technology offers significant potential for enhancing offshore oil and gas operations. By effectively separating and reinjecting high CO2 content gas into the reservoir, SHPS optimizes production, reduces emissions intensity, and contributes to environmental sustainability. Its integration with carbon capture capabilities adds further value, making it a valuable asset in the industry’s pursuit of cleaner and more sustainable energy production. The collaboration with key players and adherence to industry standards position SHPS as a game-changer in revolutionizing oil and gas production in challenging offshore environments. Overall, SHPS represents a promising solution for the industry, addressing key challenges and contributing to a low-carbon future.

Abstract Background The effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy in patients with bronchiectasis experiencing hypercapnia remains unclear. Our aim was to retrospectively analyze the short-term outcomes of HFNC therapy in such patients, and to further explore the predictors of HFNC treatment failure in this particular patient population. Methods A retrospective review was conducted on patients with bronchiectasis who received HFNC ( n = 70) for hypercapnia (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PaCO 2 ≥ 45 mmHg) between September 2019 and September 2023. Results In the study population, 30% of patients presented with acidemia (arterial pH < 7.35) at baseline. Within 24 h of HFNC treatment, there was a significant reduction in PaCO 2 levels by a mean of 4.0 ± 12.7 mmHg (95% CI -7.0 to -1.0 mmHg). Concurrently, arterial pH showed a statistically significant increase with a mean change of 0.03 ± 0.06 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.04). The overall hospital mortality rate in our study was 17.5%. The median length of hospital stay was 11.0 days (interquartile range [IQR] 8.0 to 16.0 days). Sub-analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in hospital mortality (19.0% vs. 20.4%, p = 0.896), length of hospital stay (median 14.0 days [IQR 9.0 to 18.0 days] vs. 10.0 days [IQR 7.0 to 16.0 days], p = 0.117) and duration of HFNC application (median 5.0 days [IQR 2.0 to 8.5 days] vs. 6.0 days [IQR 4.9 to 9.5 days], p = 0.076) between the acidemia group and the non-acidemia group (arterial pH ≥ 7.35). However, more patients in the non-acidemia group had do-not-intubate orders. The overall treatment failure rate for HFNC was 28.6%. Logistic regression analysis identified the APACHE II score (OR 1.24 per point) as the independent predictor of HFNC failure. Conclusions In patients with bronchiectasis and hypercapnia, HFNC as an initial respiratory support can effectively reduce PaCO 2 level within 24 h of treatment. A high APACHE II score has emerged as a prognostic indicator for HFNC treatment failure. These observations highlight randomized controlled trials to meticulously evaluate the efficacy of HFNC in this specific population.

This paper presents a mathematical programming framework for modeling the operations of power systems with high wind power penetration and BESS, accounting for wind and power demand uncertainties. For this, we introduce a multi-objective two-stage stochastic unit commitment model aimed at constructing on/off schedules that balance operating costs and CO2 emissions. Under the realistic limitations imposed by BESS high variable operating cost, we focus on assessing and analyzing the operational impact of BESS for two different integration schemes: wind farm-coupled and stand-alone. The proposed method of solution consists in an augmented ϵ-constrained algorithm with an integrated normalized euclidean distance-based bisection routine to produce more equispaced Pareto optimal solutions. We applied the proposed framework to a modified version of the New England IEEE-39 bus test system for three disjoint cases of analysis: without BESS integration, with BESS integrated into a wind farm, and with a stand-alone BESS integrated into the grid. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework and show substantial benefits in terms of CO2 emissions reductions, particularly in the stand-alone configuration, which, although limited in extent of use, promotes the direct injection of wind power into the grid, the decommitment of polluting thermal units, enhance the use of free or low emissions technologies, and contributes as a provider of spinning reserves.

To ensure a fair and extensive comparison of different heating systems four representative buildings including their heat demand for space heating and domestic hot water were defined. A model for the heat production costs has been developed based on existing methods like the VDI 2067 part 1 [1] and the simplified approach for the calculation of the "Levelised Cost of Heat" (LCoH) of the IEA SHC Task 54 "Price Cost reduction in solar thermal systems" [2]. The developed model includes the costs of purchase, installation, operation, maintenance and disposal and was implemented in an EXCEL calculation tool which enables the calculation of the total life cycle costs (LCC), the levelized cost of heat (LCoH) and the CO2 emissions over the lifetime of the system.

The carbon‐free chemical storage and release of renewable energy is an important task to drastically reduce CO2 emissions. The high specific energy density of iron and its recyclability makes it a promising storage material. Energy release by oxidation with air can be realized by the combustion of micron‐sized iron powders in retro‐fitted coal fired power plants and in fixed‐bed reactors under milder conditions. An experimental parameter study of iron powder oxidation with air was conducted based on thermogravimetric analysis in combination with wide‐angle X‐ray scattering and Mössbauer spectroscopy. In agreement with literature the oxidation was found to consist of a very fast initial oxidation of the outer particle layer followed by much slower oxidation due to diffusion of iron ions through the Fe2O3/Fe3O4 layer being the ratelimiting step. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the iron particle before and after oxidation reveal a strong particle morphology transformation. This impact on the reaction was studied by cyclization experiments. Up to 10 oxidation‐reduction cycles show that both, oxidation and reduction rates, increase strongly with cycling due to increased porosity.

Abstract Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a form of orthostatic intolerance (OI) and a key physiological indicator of autonomic dysfunction that is associated with an increased risk of major cerebrocardiovascular events. Symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion have been reported in patients with OH, which worsens symptoms and increases the risk of syncope. Since pharmacological interventions increase blood pressure (BP) independent of posture and do not restore normal baroreflex control, nonpharmacological treatments are considered the foundation of OH management. While reductions in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) during orthostatic stress are associated with a decrease in end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and hypocapnia in patients with OI, their contribution to the severity of OH is not well understood. These measures have been physiological targets in a wide variety of biofeedback interventions. This study explored the relationship between cardiovascular autonomic control, EtCO2 and cerebral hypoperfusion in patients (N=71) referred for OI. Patients with systolic OH were more likely to be male, older, demonstrate reduced adrenal and vagal baroreflex sensitivity, and reduced cardiovagal control during head-up tilt (HUT) than patients without systolic OH. Greater reduction in CBFv during HUT was associated with a larger reduction in ETCO2 and systolic BP during HUT. While deficits in cardiovascular autonomic control played a more important role in systolic OH, reduced EtCO2 was a major contributor to orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion. These findings suggest that biofeedback treatments targeting both the autonomic nervous system and EtCO2 should be part of nonpharmacological interventions complementing the standard of care in OH patients with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion.

Poor clearances, misalignments, and carbon deposits in a turbocharger due to high running hours can decrease engine efficiency. This study analyzes the effects of turbocharger reconditioning on the performance and emissions formation of a marine diesel generator engine. The engine test experiments were performed on a university training ship's auxiliary diesel engine with 4309 running hours before and after the TC overhaul. As a result, cylinder peak pressure was increased by a maximum of 3.57 % while fuel saving of 5–8 g/kWh was realized. Lower exhaust gas temperatures and improved charge air pressure by up to 7.7 % were recorded. A significant CO emission reduction of 21.6 % was recorded at idle load whereas NOx and CO2 emissions were reduced to a maximum of 4.86 % and 7.30 % at 50 % engine load. The results indicate that scheduled TC overhaul and maintenance are very useful to improve the engine's fuel economy, and performance and reduce exhaust emissions.

The use of biopolymers has received research attention for the stabilization and erosion control of course-grained soils. However, there are questions remaining on the long-term stability of biopolymer-treated soils under drying and wetting cycles. This work focuses on the performance of xanthan gum (XG) for improving mechanical properties of sands. Biopolymer-treated samples were subjected to cyclic drying/wetting according to the ASTM D559/D559M-15 code designed for soil-cement mixtures. The samples were dissected after each cycle to study the mechanism and progression of the failure. The biopolymer was extracted and studied using rheological and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The outer crust of the specimen seems to prevent intrusion of water inside the sample due to its low hydraulic conductivity. Rheological investigations indicate a reduction in the yield stress of the biopolymer gel in this crust compared to the rest of the specimen. FTIR showed the appearance of adsorbed CO2, which could indicate biological degradation.

Namun, belum dibuktikan bahwa program reduksi emisi udara yang telah diimplementasikan efektif dalam mereduksi dampak lingkungan yang terjadi. Pada penelitian ini, kajian LCA dilanjutkan untuk mengidentifikasi dampak lingkungan terbesar yang terjadi dan unit hotspot setelah dilaksanakan program reduksi emisi udara serta mengetahui efektivitas program. Software SimaPro digunakan untuk melakukan analisis LCA, dengan pendekatan midpoint dan menggunakan metode CML-IA Baseline. Berdasarkan analisis LCA, dampak lingkungan terbesar yang terjadi di PT.

Solar energy absorption and storage of integrated ceramic materials is both the absorption of sunlight and storage of sunlight into thermal energy functional materials. In this paper, the effect of Fe2O3 on the solar absorptivity, thermal storage properties, sintering temperature, and physical properties of mullite-based thermal storage ceramics was investigated. The results show that the absorptivity and thermal storage density of the sample AF4 (Bauxite:50 wt%, Clay:50 wt%, Fe2O3:11 wt%) after sintering at 1420 °C are 87.2% and 1116.5 kJ kg−1, respectively; and the unit volume of the AF4 sample can provide the power grid with 918.01 kW h of electricity, save 112.91 kg of coal, and reduce 361.33 kg of CO2 emission. This study systematically elucidated the mechanism of the enhancement of sample absorption caused by Fe3+ doping-induced changes in substrate color, reduction in material forbidden bandwidth, and lattice anharmonic vibration effect, in addition to comprehensively evaluating the feasibility of the optimal AF4 sample for use in solar energy absorbing and storing integrated ceramic materials.

Abstract. During the mid-Pliocene warm period (mPWP; 3.264–3.025 Ma), atmospheric CO2 concentrations were approximately 400 ppm, and the Antarctic Ice Sheet was substantially reduced compared to today. Antarctica is surrounded by the Southern Ocean, which plays a crucial role in the global oceanic circulation and climate regulation. Using results from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP2), we investigate Southern Ocean conditions during the mPWP with respect to the pre-industrial period. We find that the mean sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the Southern Ocean is 2.8 °C, while global mean SST warming is 2.4 °C. The enhanced warming is strongly tied to a dramatic decrease in sea ice cover over the mPWP Southern Ocean. We also see a freshening of the ocean (sub)surface, driven by an increase in precipitation over the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. The warmer and fresher surface leads to a highly stratified Southern Ocean that can be related to weakening of the deep abyssal overturning circulation. Sensitivity simulations show that the decrease in sea ice cover and enhanced warming is largely a consequence of the reduction in the Antarctic Ice Sheet. In addition, the mPWP geographic boundary conditions are responsible for approximately half of the increase in mPWP SST warming, sea ice loss, precipitation, and stratification increase over the Southern Ocean. From these results, we conclude that a strongly reduced Antarctic Ice Sheet during the mPWP has a substantial influence on the state of the Southern Ocean and exacerbates the changes that are induced by a higher CO2 concentration alone. This is relevant for the long-term future of the Southern Ocean, as we expect melting of the western Antarctic Ice Sheet in the future, an effect that is not currently taken into account in future projections by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) ensembles.

Catalytic upgrading of volatiles is an essential technology to improve the product distribution of pyrolysis for the clean and efficient utilization of low-rank coals. In this work, novel acid-base bifunctional catalysts composed of Ni/Li/Al oxides were designed and prepared using LDH precursors with tunable chemical composition and structural properties. The catalysts were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), physisorption, NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). A two-stage fixed bed reactor was employed to evaluate the performance of the catalysts. Characterization results suggest that the crystal size of NiO and the surface area of the catalyst decreased with increasing Li content and decreasing Ni content in the catalyst, while the pore volume and pore diameter were positively correlated with Li content. Moreover, the addition of Li reduced the amount of weak acid sites and raised the amount of total basic sites. Consequently, the bifunctional catalysts boosted the yield of light tar and the contents of aromatics and phenols in tar. Specifically, with the highest total acid sites (569 μmol/g) promoting the cracking of heavy pitch components, Ni2.5Li0.5Al1 decreased the content of pitch in tar to 23.8 wt.%, representing a 42.7% drop from the corresponding non-catalytic pyrolysis. Accordingly, it improved the light tar yield to 7.2 wt.%, which was 18% higher than non-catalytic pyrolysis. 450°C is identified as a suitable temperature for the catalytic upgrading of volatiles from Naomaohu coal; higher catalysis temperatures at 500°C and 550°C led to lower tar yield and lower phenols content, along with higher gas yield and more carbon deposition.

The cement and concrete industries face significant challenges in decarbonization due to escalating demand driven by rapid urbanization, population growth, and infrastructure restoration needs. Cement production alone accounts for 8% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, underscoring the urgency of exploring pathways to achieve net-zero emissions in these sectors. With over 120 nations committing to net-zero targets by 2050, a comprehensive examination of emerging carbon-saving technologies is imperative. While several promising innovations are in nascent stages, rigorous life cycle assessments are essential to determine their potential for carbon reduction. Practical strategies for achieving net-zero objectives and UN sustainability goals involve embracing circular economy principles, harnessing diverse by-product sources, fostering stakeholder engagement, and fostering technological innovation. An efficiency approach that integrates advancements in materials science, alternative fuels, and sector-wide efficiencies is crucial for success. This assessment identifies promising technologies, highlights knowledge gaps, underscores the importance of further research, and offers recommendations for implementing best practices on the path to net zero.

Kuwait stands as one of the hottest locations globally, experiencing scorching temperatures that can soar to 50 °C during the summer months. Conversely, in the winter months of December and January, temperatures may plummet to less than 10 °C. Maintaining a comfortable temperature indoors necessitates a substantial amount of energy, particularly during the scorching summer seasons. In Kuwait, most of the electrical energy required for functions such as air conditioning and lighting is derived from fossil fuel resources, contributing to escalating air pollution and global warming. To reduce dependence on conventional energy sources for heating and cooling, this article presents a case study to explore the potential of using geothermal energy for space heating and cooling in Kuwait. The case study involves utilizing a geothermal heat pump (water-sourced heat pump) in conjunction with a vertical-borehole ground heat exchanger (VBGHE). The mentioned system is deployed to regulate the climate in a six-floor apartment block comprising a small two-bedroom apartment on each level, each with a total floor area of 57 m2. Two geothermal heat pumps, each with a cooling capacity of 2.58 kW and a heating capacity of 2.90 kW, connected to two vertical-borehole heat exchangers, were deployed for each apartment to maintain temperatures at 22 °C in summer and 26 °C in winter. The findings indicate that the estimated annual energy loads for cooling and heating for the apartment block are 42,758 kWh and 113 kWh, respectively. The corresponding electrical energy consumption amounted to 9294 kWh for space cooling and 113 kWh for space heating. The observed peak cooling load was approximately 9300 kJ/h (2.58 kW) per apartment, resulting in a power density of 45 W/m2. Moreover, the HP system achieved a 22% reduction in annual electric energy consumption compared to conventional air conditioning systems. This reduction in electric energy usage led to an annual CO2 reduction of 6.6 kg/m2.

Abstract Gas field developments with long tiebacks into existing infrastructure poses flow assurance challenges due to the liquid drop out causing high back pressure and high energy consumption to transport the production leading to high OPEX, CAPEX, and CO2e emissions. A novel Pseudo-Dry-Gas (PDG) concept was developed as an inline gas-liquid separator which separate liquids from the gas and flows into a separate liquid line, along with new approaches to flow assurance design, to induce hydraulically ‘dry gas’ behavior within a wet gas pipeline over the operating envelope. The work aims to demonstrate the techno-economic benefits from a feasibility study focusing on the flow assurance aspects. Comparisons are made for project economics and integrated life cycle CO2 assessment showing the "energy intensity" for PDG and the previous chosen industry-norm concept. A widely accepted industry design software is used to generate data for two concepts based on a mid-water (100-200m) gas and oil field development with a 50 km tieback into an existing platform. Advanced flow assurance design technique is developed to evaluate the optimum location for PDG unit along the pipeline for effective subsea separation coupled with mitigation of flow assurance concerns, primarily hydrates. The performance of the PDG unit was predicted by linking the field data with PDG test data. The test was conducted on a 6" flow loop with 6" PDG prototype with pilot scale unit, covering the operational pressure and temperature and anticipated fluid properties. The CO2 assessment was undertaken in accordance with ISO 14044, linking the reservoir production to the power demand to support production, which was then converted into the equivalent CO2e emission. The results showed that the PDG design removed the need for a new unmanned processing platform over the main field and a new MEG (mono ethylene glycol) regeneration system at an existing platform which also serves as the host tie-in point. The removal of a large jacket with associated topside process equipment and brownfield platform modifications delivers reductions in CAPEX and better economic indicators, NPV (net present value) and IRR (internal rate of return). This beneficial economic outcome is reinforced with a reduction in carbon intensity for PDG concept, with more than 40%, compared to the chosen industry-norm concept. These observations are the net result of changing the internal flow resistance curve of the gas tieback from a quadratic function to a linear function enabling more efficient use of downhole pressure and temperature to reduce the overall carbon intensity of upstream gas production and mitigate flow assurance risks for hydrates and liquid surges. The work will benefit practicing engineers through the evaluation of novel PDG technology concepts for mixed oil and gas tiebacks, currently in pre-production testing phase, to improve the field economic and to evaluate CO2e emissions over the life cycle of a project in accordance with ISO 14044.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of semicrystalline poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is hindered by the hydrophobic nature and crystallinity of the substrate, and it highly depends on the available interfacial area between substrate and aqueous phase. While most studies leverage particle size reduction to increase interfacial area, this study investigates the use of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) to increase internal surface area in PET, and its impact on the enzymatic hydrolysis yields. Our work shows that scCO2 pretreatment of semicrystalline PET resulted in up to 2-fold higher terephthalic acid (TPA) yield relative to the untreated counterpart using Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC) enzyme. There is a positive correlation between the total pore surface area in the scCO2-pretreated PET samples and the final TPA yield. In addition, preliminary kinetic studies revealed faster initial production of TPA for scCO2-treated PET relative to untreated PET. ScCO2-treated PET samples showed no significant changes in the crystalline content and thermal properties. However, NMR data indicated that scCO2-treated PET has a slightly higher apparent number-average molecular weight (Mn) relative to that of untreated PET. Overall, scCO2 pretreatment led to increased semicrystalline PET susceptibility to HiC enzyme action, resulting in increased TPA yields.

The existing gaps in achieving net zero emissions within the palm oil industry in Malaysia is yet to be studied. Moreover, there are limited studies that evaluate the potential of palm oil biomass utilisation pathways based on emissions reduction capabilities, the cost of emissions reduction, and the technology readiness for implementation. This study analysed decarbonisation pathways for the upstream and midstream segments of the palm oil sector in Malaysia, encompassing oil palm plantations and palm oil mills. Various sources of greenhouse gas emissions in oil palm plantations and palm oil mills were identified and estimates of emissions were determined as theoretical emissions. The current emissions were established based on current best practice in the plantation and mill. Several biomass conversion technologies for the recovery of palm-based by-products and conversion into value-added product to decarbonise the palm oil sector and evaluated strategies to attain net-zero status are considered. In this work, the analysis considered both the existing technologies that are adopted by plantations and mills as well as the emerging technologies that have scope for implementation. With the proposed approach, the current emissions level for crude palm oil (CPO) production in Malaysia is estimated as 1,121.49 kg CO2-eq/t CPO. In current industry practice, empty fruit bunch (EFB) is underutilised as mills are typically located at rural areas with lack of suitable transportation. Besides, the lack of accessibility to the grid also limits the potential of conversion of EFB to electricity for national grid. This work examined various pathways for EFB utilisation under different scenarios evaluating their contribution potential towards net zero target in an energy self-sustained CPO production. As shown in the results, converting EFB to briquette and pellet able to achieve net-zero objective. Furthermore, EFB-biochar and EFB-syngas pathways also exhibit the potential to accomplish the net-zero target. Note that this work also assessed the technologies' readiness levels, identified challenges in implementation, and proposed several recommendations.

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was coupled with an advanced statistical strategy combining the response surface method (RSM) and the propagation of error (PoE) approach to optimize and test the robustness of the co-firing of ammonia (NH3) and coal in a fluidized bed reactor for coal phase-out processes. The CFD model was validated under experimental results collected from a pilot fluidized bed reactor. A 3k full factorial design of nine computer simulations was performed using air staging and NH3 co-firing ratio as input factors. The selected responses were NO, NH3 and CO2 emissions generation. The findings were that the design of experiments (DoE) method allowed for determining the best operating conditions to achieve optimal operation. The optimization process identified the best-operating conditions to reach stable operation while minimizing harmful emissions. Through the implementation of desirability function and robustness, the optimal operating conditions that set the optimized responses for single optimization showed not to always imply the most stable set of values to operate the system. Robust operating conditions showed that maximum performance was attained at high air staging levels (around 40%) and through a balanced NH3 co-firing ratio (around 30%). The results of the combined multi-optimization process performance should provide engineers, researchers and professionals the ability to make smarter decisions in both pilot and industrial environments for emissions reduction for decarbonization in energy production processes.

CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality and mitigating global warming, in which the supported Pd/In2O3 catalysts are attracting great attention due to their high selectivity. Nonetheless, conventional impregnation methods induce strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pd and In2O3, which leads to the excessive reduction of In2O3 and the formation of undesirable PdIn alloy in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Herein, we innovatively synthesized Pd/In2O3 nanocatalysts by the electrostatic self-assembly process between surface-modified composite precursors with opposite charges. And the organic ligands concurrently serve as Pd nanoparticle protective agents. The resultant Pd/In2O3 nanocatalyst demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of Pd nanoparticles with controllable sizes on In2O3 supports and the limited formation of PdIn alloy. As a result, it exhibits superior selectivity and stability compared to the counterparts synthesized by the conventional impregnation procedure. Typically, it attains a maximum methanol space-time yield of 0.54 gMeOH h-1gcat-1 (300 °C, 3.5 MPa, 21,000 mL gcat-1 h-1). Notably, the correlation characterization results reveal the significant effect of small-size, highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles in mitigating MSI. These results provide an alternative strategy for synthesizing highly efficient Pd/In2O3 catalysts and offer a new insight into the strong metal-support interaction.

Addressing the critical scientific challenge of enhancing the catalytic efficiency of transition metal-based metal–organic framework (MOF) materials in the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e– ORR) for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 is of paramount importance in a related field. In this context, we had developed an interface synthetic strategy for constructing a series of bimetallic Ni–M (M = Co, Fe, Cu) center MOFs. This approach capitalized on the strong synergy among metallic ions, effectively regulating the electronic structure and thereby improving the catalytic activity of Ni active sites. Notably, the proposed Ni–Co MOF catalyst demonstrated exceptional 2e– ORR activity, achieving a remarkable H2O2 selectivity of up to 96%. This performance significantly surpassed that of Ni–Fe (54%) and Ni–Cu (67%) MOFs, as well as many other reported transition metal catalysts. Detailed studies on the structure–function relationship at the atomic level unveiled that Ni species in a high oxidation state, effectively regulated and stabilized by adjacent Co2+ ions, played a pivotal role in ensuring the superior 2e– ORR activity of the Ni–Co MOF. These physical-chemical insights into the reaction mechanism and structure–function relationships offer valuable guidance for the rational design of highly efficient MOF-based catalysts and reaction systems for on-site electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 via a 2e– ORR process.

Integrating microbial fuel cells (MFC) into constructed wetland systems (CW) has been an efficient wastewater treatment to improve the pollutants removal and regenerate power energy. This study fabricated a sludge biochar material (SBM) to sequestrate the carbon of residual sludge. Thereafter used SBM and modified SBM as the substrate materials to construct three groups of CW-MFC for decreasing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. The water quality improvement in removal efficiency achieved (2.59 %, 3.10 %, 5.21 % for COD; 3.31 %, 3.60 %, 6.71 % for TN; 1.80 %, 7.38 %, 4.93 % for TP) by the application of MFC, SBM, and modified SBM in wastewater treatment, respectively. Additionally, the reduction in global warming potential (GWP) realized 17.2 %, 42.2 %, and 64.4 % resulting from these applications. The carbon flow and fate diagrams showed MFC shifted the gas phase‑carbon flow from CH4 to CO2, and SBM promoted this shift trends. Microbial diversity indicated enrichment of electrochemically active bacteria (EAB), denitrifying bacteria, and phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) by SBM. Metabolic pathways analysis showed that introduction of MFC and SBM exhibited significant increases of key functional genes in metabolic pathway of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). This study highlights the benefit of CW-MFC in and provides a new strategy for removing pollutants and abating GHG emissions in wastewater treatment.

Abstract This study assessed the capacity of a novel consensus bacterial 6-phytase variant (PhyG) to maintain growth performance of weaned pigs when added to a nutrient-reduced mixed cereal diet with two levels of dietary net energy (NE) reduction applied. A total of 360 newly weaned pigs [Greater York × Norsvin Landrace; initial body weight (BW) 8.4 ± 0.78 kg] were assigned to 60 floor-pens and 5 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design. There were 2 blocks (weaning group), 6 replicate pens per block, and 6 pigs/pen (3 male, 3 female), in total of 12 replications per treatment. Diets were based on wheat, corn, barley, and soybean meal and were offered to pigs in 2 phases in pelleted form (0–14 and 14–35 d post-weaning). Treatments comprised a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC) and 4 negative control (NC) diets supplemented with PhyG. The NC diets were reduced in digestible P, Ca, Na, and digestible amino acids vs. PC, according to the expected contribution of PhyG added at 1,000 phytase units (FTU)/kg (NC1) or 2,000 FTU/kg (NC2), respectively. Each NC1 and NC2 was formulated at two NE reduction levels, designated ‘low’ and ‘high’ (‘low’: -53 to -65 kcal/kg and ‘high’: -73 to -86 kcal/kg, vs. PC at 1,000 and 2,000 FTU/kg PhyG, respectively). Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Means separation was by Tukey’s HSD test. During both phases and overall (0–35 d), average BW, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient- and NE-reduced treatments, were either not different or were improved compared with the PC. Overall ADG, ADFI, and final BW (d 35) were greater in NC2+PhyG 2,000 FTU/kg ‘low’ vs. PC (466 vs. 424 g, 9.9%, 622 vs. 567 g, 9.7%, and 24.7 vs. 23.1 kg, 6.9%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Total feed costs (ingredients price, February 2023) and estimated carbon footprint (CFP; FeedPrint, WUR, The Netherland) per kilogram of BW gain (BWG) were reduced in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient- and NE-reduced treatments vs. PC. Feed costs saving per kg BWG were greater with ‘high’ than ‘low’ NE reduction applied (-0.013 vs. -0.007 €, respectively, vs. PC) with PhyG at 1,000 FTU/kg, and it was greatest in NC2+PhyG 2,000 FTU/kg with ‘low’ NE reduction (-0.036 € vs. PC). Similarly, the CFP was reduced from 2,068 to 1,840 g CO2 eq/kg BWG (-11 %) by NC2+PhyG 2,000 FTU/kg with ‘low’ NE reduction vs. PC. In conclusion, the application of a full nutrient matrix with ‘high’ or ‘low’ NE reduction combined with supplementation of PhyG maintained growth performance of weaned pigs and reduced the total feed costs and carbon footprint per kg BW gain, lead to production and sustainability benefits.

Background and aims To assess development of a robust emissions accounting framework for expansive miombo woodland savannas covering ~2 million km2 of southern Africa that typically are burnt under relatively severe late dry season (LDS) conditions. Methods A detailed site-based study of fuel accumulation, combustion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factor parameters under early dry season (EDS) and LDS conditions along a central rainfall-productivity and associated miombo vegetation structural and floristics gradient, from lower rainfallsites in northern Botswana to higher rainfall sites in northern Zambia. Key results Assembled field data inform core components of the proposed emissions reduction framework: fuel and combustion conditions sampled across the vegetation/productivity gradient can be represented by three defined Vegetation Fuel Types (VFTs); fuel accumulation, combustion and emissions parameters are presented for these. Applying this framework for an illustrative case, GHG emissions (t CO2-e) from EDS fires were one-third to half those of LDS fires per unit area in eligible miombo VFTs. Conclusions Our accounting framework supports undertaking EDS fire management to significantly reduce emissions and, realistically, burnt extent at landscape scales. We consider application of presented data to development of formal emissions abatement accounting methods, linkages with potential complementary woody biomass and soil organic carbon sequestration approaches, and necessary caveats concerning implementation issues.

In recent years, the level of digitalization and intelligence in the energy sector has profoundly changed the management mode of the energy sector. However, in the process of promoting the digital transformation of the energy sector, we also face some difficulties. One of the main manifestations is the lack of energy data sharing, and the difficulty of realizing the convergence and integration of various types of energy data. In addition, there is insufficient mastery of customer-side energy use data and a lag in the perception of customer demand, which requires the improvement and enhancement of energy efficiency diagnosis and energy saving services. At the same time, we have not yet established advanced digital technology monitoring means to grasp the user’s energy use and carbon emissions in real time. Therefore, this paper proposes the study of high-precision accounting methods for regional carbon emissions under the carbon peak goal. Based on the energy consumption and production activities of each region, a greenhouse gas emission inventory is compiled, so that carbon emissions can be accurately calculated. The high-precision accounting method of carbon emissions is analyzed, and by establishing a more complete database and model, and constructing a regional online monitoring system under the peak carbon target, we aim to improve the efficiency of data acquisition and processing, as well as how to combine carbon emission accounting with the peak carbon target, in order to provide support for the formulation of a more effective emission reduction policy. The testing experiments after flow and CO2 concentration measurements show that the accuracy of the experiments on regional carbon emissions is as high as 97.5%.

Solar energy technologies are emerging as strong alternatives to their fossil fuel-based conventional counterparts for various applications. Solar water heating system (SWHS) is one of the most adopted technologies all over the world. Moreover, the building sector consumes significant energy from fossil fuels worldwide to meet hot water demand. This fossil fuel consumption can be reduced with the surplus economic and environmental benefits through the refurbishment of SWHSs in residential buildings. Additionally, the student hostels of academic institutes/Universities have great potential to save energy, environment, and money. In view of the same, the technical, economic, and environmental analyses of refurbishing SWHS in the student hostel are presented in the present paper. The analysis is carried out for the hostel named 'Raman' of DIT University, located in Dehradun, India. The energy-saving potentials of flat plate collector (FPC)-based and evacuated tube collector (ETC)-based SWHSs to accomplish the hot water demand of selected site are assessed in comparison with electric geyser. Moreover, the economic analysis is also reported in terms of net present value and benefit-to-cost analysis. Whereas the environmental benefit is presented in terms of reduction in equivalent CO2 emissions through implementing both types of considered SWHSs. It is found that the FPC-based and ETC-based SWHSs can fulfil 60.9% and 67.6% of the energy demand to heat the required water. Whereas, both of the systems are found economically as well as environmentally beneficial and ETC-based SWHS is recommended for the selected site. The present study may be useful for the energy planning and management of student hostels under academic institutes/Universities.

Abstract Three R&D initiatives in seismic data acquisition are presented focusing on the reduction of environmental footprint while reducing the operational cost and increasing the efficiency in offshore field operations. The first initiative is the development of a new seismic sensor that can remain on the seafloor for up to five years, the On Demand Ocean Bottom Node - OD OBN (Lopez et al., 2023), helping to decrease the cost of seismic monitoring surveys. The second initiative is a new type of seismic source with lower environmental impact, the Marine Vibrator, which improves the usage of the available energy of the seismic source within the most useful frequency band for seismic acquisition, suppressing higher frequencies potentially harmful for marine mammals (Wartzok and Ketten, 1999). The third initiative is a pilot 3D seismic acquisition in deep-offshore Brazil using fiber optic cables, originally installed on the seafloor as part of a Permanent Reservoir Monitoring (PRM) system, which will be interrogated using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) while recording shots from a seismic streamer vessel present in the area. It is expected that the 3D seismic data acquired in this manner will offer a good understanding of the potential for DAS application for seismic data acquisition using fibers laid on the seafloor, considering the fiber's limitations in sensitivity and angular response. In addition to conventional applications for reservoir monitoring, these technologies are promising for applications linked to the energy transition, such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects, where the expected low commercial value of the sequestered CO2 requires low-cost monitoring methods to be affordable.

ABSTRACT: Wastewater treatment plants play an important role within the urban water cycle to prevent the natural water environment and human health from being negatively affected by human activities. However, wastewater treatment processes, such as effluent discharge and indirect emissions resulting from energy or chemical production, also negatively affect the environment. Footprints have been used to track human influence on the environment in different areas of interest and have been applied to assess the sustainability of wastewater treatment plants. In this article, a comprehensive review of footprint assessment was investigated to evaluate the wastewater treatment process in wastewater treatment plants. The review showed that carbon footprinting was used to assess the sustainability of WWTPs, and that other footprint assessment applications (such as nitrogen and phosphorus footprinting) were also introduced to assess eutrophication of water bodies. To promote the application of footprint assessment, this article regulates the study objectives, frameworks, system boundaries, data processing methods, and the resulting interpretation process. The pros and cons of the footprint assessments were discussed and investigated in detail, examining the CO2 production on each island of the Canary archipelago, and several suggestions were proposed to improve the footprint assessments. Analysis of footprint assessments at different wastewater treatment plants revealed that wastewater treatment technologies and scales had a significant impact on footprints. Furthermore, research hotspots identified using a keyword network diagram showed that the water-carbon-energy nexus was a promising direction for future studies. The purpose of the study is to improve the reduction of the carbon footprint both at the level of direct and indirect emissions factors using new tools and methodologies.

Abstract The effect of a novel consensus bacterial 6-phytase variant (PhyG) without or with a xylanase–β-glucanase (XB) when added to an energy and nutrient-reduced diet on growth performance and production benefit was evaluated in pigs from wean-to-finish. A total of 192 weaned pigs [DanBred x Pi; initial body weight (BW) 7.18 ± 0.38 kg] were randomized to 4 treatments with 12 (4 piglets/pen) and 24 pens (2 pigs/pen) per treatment (1:1 male to female) for nursery and grow-finish phases, respectively. Diets were wheat-corn-barley-rye-soybean meal-based and fed in 5 phases (pre-starter, 7–11 kg, starter, 11–25 kg, grower I, 25–55 kg, grower II, 55–85 kg and finisher, 85–110 kg BW). Treatments comprised: 1) a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC); 2) a negative control (NC1) without added inorganic phosphate, reduced (based on specific PhyG dose) in net energy (NE), calcium (Ca), digestible amino acids (AA) and sodium (Na) vs. PC, supplemented with PhyG at 1,000, 1000, 750, 500 and 500 FTU/kg during pre-starter, starter, grower I, II and finisher phase, respectively (NC1+PhyG ‘low’); 3) a negative control (NC2) without added inorganic phosphate, supplemented with PhyG at 2,000, 2,000, 1,000, 750 and 750 FTU/kg in each phase with reduction in NE, Ca, dig AA and Na vs. PC based on the specific PhyG dose (NC2+PhyG ‘high’); and 4) a negative control (NC3) that was similar to 2) but supplemented with XB to provide 2,400 U/kg xylanase and 304 U/kg β-glucanase, with additional reduction in NE and dig AA based on the contribution of XB vs NC1 (NC3+PhyG ‘low’+XB). Data were analyzed by ANOVA, and means separation was by Tukey’s HSD test. Growth performance in all enzyme-supplemented diets was maintained or improved compared with PC. The NC3+PhyG ‘low’+XB treatment significantly improved performance vs. PC; average daily gain (ADG) and BW were greater vs. PC in starter (620 g and 28.2 kg vs. 557 g and 26.4 kg) and grower I (859 g and 65.1 kg vs. 777 g and 60.0 kg) respectively; feed conversion ratio (FCR) was reduced in grower II vs. PC (2.10 vs. 2.25; P &lt; 0.05). The final BW was 114.5, 114.8, 115.6 and 116.7 kg in PC, NC1+PhyG ‘low’, NC2+PhyG ‘high’ and NC3+PhyG ‘low’+XB, respectively (P &gt; 0.05). Carcass parameters were unaffected by treatments. Compared with PC, NC1+PhyG ‘low’, NC2+PhyG ‘high’ and NC3+PhyG ‘low’+XB conferred a 3.8 to 5.8% reduction in total feed cost (ingredients price, October 2023)/kg BWG and 4.4 to 6.8% reduction in the total carbon footprint (FeedPrint, WUR, The Netherland, CO2 eq., g)/kg BWG. The results confirm the appropriacy of the applied matrix values with PhyG supplementation, with or without XB, in mixed cereal diets from wean-to-finish and highlight the potential feed cost and sustainability benefit of using the phytase alone or in combination with the carbohydrase enzymes.

Abstract Equinor (hereafter also referred as ‘The Company’) is undergoing an internal transformation reflected not just in its culture but also in its operations and investment portfolio. At the core of this transformation is a strategy built around The Company's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and becoming net-zero by 2050. Relative to 2015, The Company is set to have a 50% net reduction in operated emissions and an upstream carbon intensity of ~6 kg of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) by 2030. One notable area in this space is the decarbonization of Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSO) units, which play a crucial role in offshore hydrocarbon production. The Company's decarbonization activities permeate throughout its management system. In this context, The Company sets clearly and rigorously that projects be evaluated under the Best Available Technique (BAT) principle. These evaluations include scrutiny and screening of the technologies and processes that deal with specific pollutants onboard FPSOs and fixed installations, from noise and discharges during drilling operations to solid waste and fugitive emissions. Assessment of emission reduction potential, abatement cost, benchmarking, experience sharing, and environmental budgeting are important elements in the definition and delivery of successful energy efficient projects. The Company has had a presence in Brazil for more than two decades. The Raia project (former BM-C-33) is a consortium made up of Equinor (35% and operator), Repsol Sinopec Brasil (35%), and Petrobras (30%), which represents the third FPSO unit to be put on production and operated by The Company after Peregrino and Bacalhau. The $9 billion development, located in the Campos basin at a 2900 m water depth, is a gas and oil/condensate project that will process liquids and gas to sales specifications onboard the FPSO. The offshore gas processing is based on an innovative concept and first of a kind in Brazil. With a production start in 2028, the project is to recover above 1 billion boe and deliver 15% of Brazil's entire gas needs. Emission abatement technologies to be implemented onboard the FPSO include: combined cycle for power generation (CCGT),closed flare and cargo vent systems,variable speed drive (VSD) on large compressor drives and,turbo expanders (TEX) for hydrocarbon (HC) dew pointing. The most significant success in the decarbonization onboard the FPSO is the use of a CCGT for power generation. The technology relies on excess heat recovery and a steam turbine. Through this and additional measures, the Raia project was able to shift its carbon footprint by around 64%, resulting in an intensity of 5.6 kg/boe. Further optimization and operational experience could improve the project's carbon intensity. For example, by increasing gas export rates or maintaining controlled flaring during start-up and commissioning activities.

The conversion of bambara groundnut seed residues into biochar facilitated the bioavailability and retention of more nutrients (C, N, P, K and Mg) after repeated application of biochar. However, the mechanisms of microbially mediated biochar-C degradation and nutrient cycling responses to repeated biochar application, particularly in different hierarchical soil aggregates, are largely unknown. A 20-day incubation experiment was conducted on Ultisols from a 4-year cucumber field trial in Nsukka, Nigeria. The effects of repeated application of bambara seed residue biochar with or without NPK fertilizer on soil aggregate associated electrical conductivity (EC), basal respiration, microbial biomass, and soil enzyme activities were determined. The results showed that the concentration of organic matter in the bulk soils increased with biochar and NPK+biochar treatments. These treatments also increased the soil EC, cumulative CO2 respiration, microbial biomass C and N concentrations, and the activities of tyrosine-aminopeptidase and sulfatase enzymes, compared to the biochar treatment and the control soil. The NPK+biochar treatment contributed 35% more to β-cellobiosidase activity, but the biochar treatment resulted in 85% reduction in N-Acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activity, indicating microbial N mining. The NPK and NPK+biochar treatments accounted for a higher percentage of N-, C and N-, and S- cycle enzyme activities, although their composition was relatively higher with the latter treatment. The overall soil biochemical responses were significantly higher in the micro-aggregates (< 0.25 mm) than in the macro-aggregates (≤ 4.75 - 0.25 mm); least of all in the small macro-aggregates (0.25 - 1.00 mm). Therefore, repeated application of biochar to N-deficient soils generally does not result in positive soil biochemical responses. However, repeated application of biochar together with NPK fertilizer modulates N limitation and optimizes microbial nutrient cycling processes, especially in micro-aggregates.

Abstract Over the past four decades, offshore oil and gas (O&G) production in Brazil has transitioned from shallow waters to deep waters, necessitating considerations for ensuring the integrity of subsea systems in this challenging environment. This study focused on field inspection reports that provided insights into the condition of carbon steel pipelines and subsea equipment, which are protected by galvanic cathodic protection. The findings from laboratory testing and thermodynamic simulations conducted under varying environmental conditions were compared with these evaluations. Additionally, a comprehensive survey of historical shipwrecks, which lacked corrosion protection and had remained on the seabed for decades, was conducted. The preservation and partial integrity of these shipwrecks were inferred from images captured during inspections conducted by remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs). By comparing the results of laboratory tests, subsea inspection reports, thermodynamic simulations, and ROV images of shipwrecks, it was observed that the corrosion rate in seawater at considerable depths is significantly reduced. This phenomenon allows shipwrecks to persist on the seabed for extended periods without severe corrosion. Furthermore, the analysis of PETROBRAS technical inspection reports on subsea equipment revealed that components of offshore production systems located in deep waters, which lack effective galvanic cathodic protection, continue functioning without compromising their structural integrity. This analysis supported the investigation of a corrosion protection technique applied to subsea production systems in deep water, based on kinetic considerations that complement existing thermodynamic-based criteria, with minimal risk to structural integrity. Importantly, further investigation is warranted to explore alternative cathodic protection potentials, particularly those exceeding −800 mVAg/AgCl, under high pressure and reduced temperatures. This initiative has contributed to the reduction of CO2 emissions, as there is no longer a need to make two trips to the installation site – one to install the anode skid and another to confirm the reestablishment of the protection potential.

Sperm capacitation involves biochemical and physiological changes that enable sperm to fertilize the oocyte. It can be induced in vitro under controlled conditions that simulate the environment of the oviduct. While extensively studied in mammals, its approach in lizards remains absent. Understanding the mechanisms that ensure reproduction is essential for advancing the implementation of assisted reproductive technologies in this group. We aimed to perform a sperm analysis to determine if capacitation-related changes were induced after incubation with capacitating media. Fifteen males of Sceloporus torquatus were collected during the early stage of the reproductive season. The sperm were isolated from the seminal plasma and then diluted up to a volume of 150 μL using BWW medium to incubate with 5% CO2 at 30 °C for a maximum duration of 3 h. A fraction was retrieved hourly for ongoing sperm assessment. The sperm analysis included assessments of its motility, viability, the capacitation status using the chlortetracycline (CTC) assay, and the acrosome integrity with the lectin binding assay to detect changes during incubation. We found that total motility was maintained up to 2 h post incubation, after which it decreased. However, sperm viability remained constant. From that moment on, we observed a transition to a deeper and less symmetrical flagellar bending in many spermatozoa. The CTC assay indicated a reduction in the percentage of sperm showing the full (F) pattern and an increase in those exhibiting the capacitated (B) and reactive (RA) patterns, accompanied by an elevation in the percentage of damaged acrosomes as revealed by the lectin binding assay. In mammals, these changes are often associated with sperm capacitation. Our observations support the notion that this process may also occur in saurian. While sperm analysis is a valuable method for assessing certain functional changes, additional approaches are required to validate this process.

Grape is an economically important fruit crop worldwide, for which light qualities play a diverse role in vineyard growth and development. However, the regulatory mechanisms between different light qualities and the quality of plant growth at the morphophysiological and pomological levels remain unknown. Therefore, in the current study, we studied plant physiological, biochemical and genetical analysis to investigate the response of all seven light qualities, including red (R), blue (B), white (W), 1-red, 1 blue (1R1B), 2-red, 1-blue (2R1B), 1-red, 2-blue (1R2B), and natural (N, was used as control group) to evaluate 'Kyoho'grape (Vitis labrusca L. × V. vinifera) morphophysiological, pomological traits at light responsive transcriptional pathway, which revealed the possible networking metabolism controlling fruit quality and quantity of grape plant. Our results showed that photosynthetic indicators such as leaf stomata, number of stomata, and longitudinal and transverse diameter of stomata improved under red and blue light qualities as compared to white light. Leaf gas exchange indicators showed that net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, intercellular CO2 concentration rate, total conductance to CO2, stomatal conductance, conductance to water vapor, maximal quantum yield of PS (II), actual photochemical quantum efficiency, electron transfer chain, and non-photochemical quantum efficiency improve under blue and red light. Photosynthetic pigments showed that chlorophyll a and b, carotenoid, and total pigment contents improved under blue and red light. Nutrient elements showed that potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, calcium, iron, and zinc contents improved under blue and red light. Morphological and organic acid indicators such as the appearance of fruit shape, firmness, and titratable acidity improved under blue and light. However, there was a notable increment in the total soluble sugar under blue and red light as compared to natural light. The composition of sugar including (sucrose, fructose, glucose) and organic acids (tartaric acid, citric acid, and malic acid) improved under blue and red light (fruits) and showed notable reductions for tartaric acid under blue and red light (leaves) as compared to natural light. Aromatic compounds showed that esters, aldehydes, acetaldehyde, 2-hexenal, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, butanoic acid, ethyl ester, 1-hexanol, 2-ethyl, 2-propanone, and 1‑hydroxyl, improved under blue and red light. Further, changes in enhanced expression of light-responsive genes including VvCRYI, VvCRY2, VvPHYA, VvPHYB, VvCOP1, VvHY5, VvHYH, and VvPIF4 upregulated under blue and red light, while VvPIF3.1 down-regulated as compared to natural light. Also, chlorophyll synthesis-related genes including VvSGR, VvPAO, and VvCHLH upregulated under blue and red light, while VvNYC1, VvPPH, and VvPOR showed noticeable changes under blue and red light as compared to natural light. Interestingly, most of the relative genes were highly expressed in fruits as compared to leaves. Finally, we have established correlation and principal component analysis for indicators in grapes. Current findings provide novel mechanisms by which different responses of supplementary light control the plant fruit quality of grapes.

Cellulosic substrates, including wood and thatch, have become icons for sustainable architecture and construction, however, they suffer from high flammability because of their inherent cellulosic composition. Current control measures for such hazards include applying intumescent fire-retardant (IFR) coatings that swell and form a char layer upon ignition, protecting the underlying substrate from burning. Typically, conventional IFR coatings are opaque and are made of halogenated compounds that release toxic fumes when ignited, compromising the roofing's aesthetic value and sustainability. In this work, phytic acid, a naturally occurring phosphorus source extracted from rice bran, was used to synthesize phytic acid-based fire-retardants (PFR) via esterification under reflux, along with powdered chicken eggshells (CES) as calcium carbonate (CaCO3) bio-filler. These components were incorporated into melamine formaldehyde resin to produce the transparent IFR coating. It was revealed that the developed IFR coatings achieved the highest fire protection rating based on UL94 flammability standards compared to the control. The coatings also yielded increased LOI values, indicative of self-extinguishing properties. A 17°C elevation of the IFR coating's melting temperature and a significant ∼172% increase in enthalpy change from the control were observed, indicating enhanced fire-retardancy. The thermal stability of the coatings was improved, denoted by reduced mass losses, and increased residual masses after thermal degradation. As validated by microscopy and spectroscopy, the abundance of phosphorus and carbon groups in the coatings' condensed phase after combustion indicates enhanced char formation. In the gas phase, TG-FTIR showed the evolution of non-flammable CO2, and fire-retardant PO and P-O-C. Mechanical property testing confirmed no reduction in the adhesion strength of the IFR coating. With these results, the developed IFR coating exhibited enhanced fire-retardancy whilst remaining optically transparent, suggestive of a dual-phase IFR protective mechanism involving the release of gaseous combustion diluents and the formation of a thermally insulating char layer.

Abstract. Ocean acidification is likely to impact all stages of the ocean carbonate pump, i.e. the production, export, dissolution and burial of biogenic CaCO3. However, the associated feedback on anthropogenic carbon uptake and ocean acidification has received little attention. It has previously been shown that Earth system model (ESM) carbonate pump parameterizations can affect and drive biases in the representation of ocean alkalinity, which is critical to the uptake of atmospheric carbon and provides buffering capacity towards associated acidification. In the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), we show divergent responses of CaCO3 export at 100 m this century, with anomalies by 2100 ranging from −74 % to +23 % under a high-emission scenario. The greatest export declines are projected by ESMs that consider pelagic CaCO3 production to depend on the local calcite/aragonite saturation state. Despite the potential effects of other processes on alkalinity, there is a robust negative correlation between anomalies in CaCO3 export and salinity-normalized surface alkalinity across the CMIP6 ensemble. Motivated by this relationship and the uncertainty in CaCO3 export projections across ESMs, we perform idealized simulations with an ocean biogeochemical model and confirm a limited impact of carbonate pump anomalies on 21st century ocean carbon uptake and acidification. However, we highlight a potentially abrupt shift, between 2100 and 2300, in the dissolution of CaCO3 from deep to subsurface waters when the global-scale mean calcite saturation state reaches about 1.23 at 500 m (likely when atmospheric CO2 reaches 900–1100 ppm). During this shift, upper ocean acidification due to anthropogenic carbon uptake induces deep ocean acidification driven by a substantial reduction in CaCO3 deep dissolution following its decreased export at depth. Although the effect of a diminished carbonate pump on global ocean carbon uptake and surface ocean acidification remains limited until 2300, it can have a large impact on regional air–sea carbon fluxes, particularly in the Southern Ocean.

Abstract Pseudo Dry Gas (PDG) technology is proposed as an alternative concept for transporting multiphase fluids (gas, condensate, and water) for long deep-water subsea tieback developments while delivering significant reductions in Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by the mitigation of compression (Liebana, et al, 2021)). The basis of the PDG system is to remove the liquid from the main pipeline using piggable liquid removal unit(s). With the removal of the majority of liquid, the shape of the internal resistance curve of the tieback is changed from a quadratic function to a linear function over the operational envelope, allowing the pipeline to operate like a "pseudo" dry gas system. The original prototype of this design underwent low pressure flow loop testing (Thomas, et al 2021)). The current work involved the fabrication of a 180 bar rated PDG unit, a subsea magnetic drive pump and the supporting subsea control system for flow loop testing undertaken at TÜV SÜD National Engineering Laboratories (hereinafter NEL), UK. This development program is supported by operators in conjunction with the Net Zero Technology Center. The testing program is developed to encompass the expected operational envelope that the PDG units would see in service aligned to a broad range of asset-based study work and to consider critical non-dimensional flow assurance parameters to ensure scalability. The testing parameters considered are pressure (up to 125 bar), temperature (up to 40 C), and inclination (zero- and two-degrees). In addition, various liquids are considered e.g., two hydrocarbon fluids (representing oil and condensate), brine water, and hydrocarbon and brine water mixture. An extensive number of test points at different liquid and gas superficial velocities are included both with and without the PDG unit installed to allow for baseline comparisons, with entrainment samples being collected upstream and downstream of PDG unit aligned to the Tulsa University technique (Bhaskoro, et al 2024). This paper will focus on how varying certain parameters including superficial gas velocity, superficial liquid velocity, and pressure impacts the separation efficiency and liquid entrainment. Some examples of mapping actual study results onto the high-pressure testing results are included to allow a greater understanding of required versus actual performance. Results show comparable PDG separation performance at high pressure for all cases indicating negligible impact of higher pressures in relation to required performance as linked to the actual study cases.

Environmental stewardship is important in urological oncology given the major crises facing our planet in general and the specific links between environmental destruction and urological cancer care. This includes direct links such as an association between air pollution and higher risk of bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers [1Cohen G. Levy I. Yuval et al.Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and cancer among survivors of myocardial infarction: a 20-year follow-up study.Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2017; 24: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar]. There are also indirect links such as substantial disruptions in cancer care due to climate-related extreme weather events [2Gudenkauf LM, Hathaway CA, Carroll JE, et al. Inequities in the impacts of hurricanes and other extreme weather events for cancer survivors. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. In press. https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-23-1029.Google Scholar]. There are many ways to reduce our environmental impact in daily urological practice. Telemedicine, which increased dramatically among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic [3Dubin J.M. Wyant W.A. Balaji N.C. et al.Telemedicine usage among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional study.J Med Internet Res. 2020; 22e21875Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar], is one important way to do this. A recent systematic review of 48 studies including 68 465 481 telemedicine consultations showed that telemedicine saved 691 825 tons of carbon emissions and 3 318 464 047 km of travel distance [4Rodler S. Ramacciotti L.S. Maas M. et al.The impact of telemedicine in reducing the carbon footprint in health care: a systematic review and cumulative analysis of 68 million clinical consultations.Eur Urol Focus. 2023; 9: 873-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. It also resulted in significant cost savings for patients. Importantly, previous studies have shown that telemedicine for genitourinary cancer care is associated with high rates of satisfaction among both patients and physicians [5Margolin E.J. Pina Martina L.A. Miles C.H. et al.Telemedicine in management of genitourinary malignancies: patient and physician perspectives.Urol Oncol. 2021; 39: 480-486Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar]. Virtual conference participation is another way to reduce our carbon footprint. We previously estimated that the 2019 American Urological Association and European Association of Urology (EAU) conferences resulted in approximately 15 923 and 11 256 metric tons of travel-related CO2 emissions, respectively [6Patel S.H. Gallo K. Becker R. Borin J. Loeb S. Climate change impact of virtual urology meetings.Eur Urol. 2021; 80: 121-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. This is equivalent to approximately 5872 passenger vehicles driven for 1 yr, or the CO2 emissions from 3.05 million gallons of gasoline. Since the study only considered travel-related emissions of attendees, these numbers are likely to reflect substantial underestimation of overall conference-related emissions. That notwithstanding, the numbers highlight the significant impact of conducting meetings virtually rather than in person. For conferences and other meetings held in person, the United Nations and other organizations have published guidance and resources on how to conduct green meetings [7United Nations Environment Programme. Green meeting guide 2009. https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/7834.Google Scholar, 8US Environmental Protection Agency. Sustainable Region 9 green meetings and conferences policy. https://www.epa.gov/p2/sustainable-region-9-green-meetings-and-conferences-policy.Google Scholar]. Examples include choosing a central location to avoid excessive transportation, serving more sustainable food (eg, plant-based and locally sourced options), and avoiding single-use water bottles and paper handouts. We also have an opportunity to reduce environmental impact and health care costs during clinical decision-making with patients. In particular, reducing low-value care and unnecessary testing is an important way to mitigate the environmental burden of health care [9Leapman M.S. Thiel C.L. Gordon I.O. et al.Environmental impact of prostate magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Eur Urol. 2023; 83: 463-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. For example, studies have shown persistent overutilization of inappropriate imaging for staging of low-risk prostate cancer [10Lange S.M. Choudry M.M. Hunt T.C. et al.Impact of choosing wisely on imaging in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.Urol Oncol. 2023; 41: 48.e19-48.e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 11Drangsholt S.

Ciprut S. et al.Quantifying downstream impact of inappropriate staging imaging in a cohort of veterans with low- and intermediate-risk incident prostate cancer.Urol Oncol. 2019; 37: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar]. This can not only cause undue anxiety, false-positive results leading to additional imaging, and excess costs but also contributes to the environmental burden. The 2023 EAU guidelines on prostate cancer recommend omitting initial prostate biopsy on a shared decision-making basis when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are negative with low clinical suspicion, and performing targeted biopsy only for patients with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System score ≥3 and prior negative biopsy [12Mottet N, Cornford P, van den Bergh RCN, et al. EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG guidelines on prostate cancer. Arnhem, The Netherlands: European Association of Urology; 2023. https://d56bochluxqnz.cloudfront.net/documents/full-guideline/EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG-Guidelines-on-Prostate-Cancer-2023_2023-06-13-141145.pdf.Google Scholar]. A recent life cycle assessment found that if 28% of biopsies were avoided because of negative MRI and targeted-only biopsies were performed as in the PRECISION study [13Kasivisvanathan V. Rannikko A.S. Borghi M. et al.MRI-targeted or standard biopsy for prostate-cancer diagnosis.N Engl J Med. 2018; 378: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar], this would save 1.4 million kg of CO2 emissions per 100 000 patients, or the equivalent of 700 000 l of gasoline, in comparison to a strategy of MRI with systematic and targeted biopsies [9Leapman M.S. Thiel C.L. Gordon I.O. et al.Environmental impact of prostate magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Eur Urol. 2023; 83: 463-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. Use of biparametric MRI is another way to reduce carbon emissions in comparison to multiparametric MRI [9Leapman M.S. Thiel C.L. Gordon I.O. et al.Environmental impact of prostate magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Eur Urol. 2023; 83: 463-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar] when clinically appropriate [14Schoots I.G. Barentsz J.O. Bittencourt L.K. et al.PI-RADS Committee position on MRI without contrast medium in biopsy-naive men with suspected prostate cancer: narrative review.Am J Roentgenol. 2021; 216: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar]. For some urological oncology conditions, clinical guidelines include a choice between different imaging modalities that have substantially different carbon footprints. For example, guidelines for surveillance of stage 1 kidney cancer recommend abdominal computed tomography (CT) or MRI within 6 mo, then testing at least annually with either MRI, CT, or ultrasound [15National Comprehensive Cancer Network. NCCN guidelines: kidney cancer, version 3.2024. https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/kidney.pdf.Google Scholar]. A life cycle assessment from Australia revealed that mean CO2 equivalent emissions are 17.5 kg/scan for MRI, 9.2 kg/scan for CT, and 0.5 kg/scan for ultrasound [16McAlister S. McGain F. Petersen M. et al.The carbon footprint of hospital diagnostic imaging in Australia.Lancet Reg Health West Pac. 2022; 24100459PubMed Google Scholar]. The guidelines also recommend chest X-ray or chest CT annually for 5 yr, for which chest X-ray involves a substantially lower carbon footprint (mean CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.8 kg/scan). It is also important to address environmental impact in the operating room. A systematic review of climate-smart practices in the operating theater identified the following key areas: (1) waste reduction by segregation; (2) waste reduction by recycling, reuse, and reprocessing; (3) sterilization; (4) anesthesia gas management; and (5) improvement of energy use [17Pradere B. Mallet R. de La Taille A. et al.Climate-smart actions in the operating theatre for improving sustainability practices: a systematic review.Eur Urol. 2023; 83: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar]. While many of these factors are outside a surgeon's control, the authors recommend that surgeons can most readily take direct action on waste reduction, endorse greater education in this area, and advocate for more climate-smart practices while engaging in supply-chain discussions. Finally, patient counseling should take into consideration recommendations that simultaneously promote health and sustainability [18Cole A.P. Gupta N. Loeb S.

Loeb S. Dietary and lifestyle recommendations that align patient and planetary health.Eur Urol Focus. 2023; 9: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. For example, greenhouse gas emissions are substantially greater for meat products (particularly beef) than for plant-based foods [20Ritchie H, Rosado P, Roser M. Environmental impacts of food production. Our World in Data. https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food.Google Scholar]. Meat consumption is associated with a greater risk of bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers [21Zhang S. Wang Q. He J.

Active transport (eg, commuting by walking or cycling) is another potential way for patients to reduce their carbon footprint while promoting physical activity [19Cole A.P. Loeb S.

Abstract The energy transition is an inevitable global development driven by geopolitical, environmental, economic and societal factors. It will fundamentally change how we access energy resources and how we will rebalance the growing demand in critical commodities. The global mobility sector consumes about 2/3 of the world crude oil production, which stands currently at or above 105 million barrels of oil per day (mmbopd). Even a minor reduction, for instance by increasing the electric vehicle fleet, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions but further stress our power grids along with an increasing demand in critical minerals, required by clean tech manufacturing. Industry strategies and technology developments have to address this conundrum. Renewable energy sources already significantly contributing to the domestic electricity grid (13% in US in 2021) but are dominated by intermittent resources like wind and solar energy, whereas dispatchable, clean energy resources are neglected. The potential of dispatchable geothermal energy is undisputed, though challenges in subsurface risk assessment, completion technologies, upfront investments and lengthy permitting processes impact the economic potential of this technology. Lithium is the key critical mineral in clean tech, particularly for batteries in the mobility sector due to its excellent energy density to weight ratio. Environmental impact of invasive lithium mineral mining or large evaporation ponds can be avoided by Direct Lithium Extraction from brines. It is a valuable solution particularly when deployed in proximity to mature hydrocarbon basins, attributed to a wealth in subsurface data, existing infrastructure, and qualified human resources. DLE technologies are facing some challenges in terms of freshwater usage, the application of chemical agents, excessive land usage and reliance on external energy supply. Finally, not every brine chemistry is suitable for the envisaged DLE technology. Direct lithium extraction based on electrodialysis employs ion-selective membranes in a clean, emission free process. The technology is robust and takes advantage of successful membrane applications at multiple desalination plants around the world. Along with battery-grade lithium the electrodialysis produces green hydrogen, outputs freshwater and sequesters CO2 as by-products. When combined with a geothermal power generation the technology uses onsite energy and the produced brine in a clean and environmentally friendly process. Lithium-rich reservoirs with a favorable geothermal signature have been reported from mature hydrocarbon basins across the United States and their direct lithium extraction offers attractive economics, given the growing lithium demand forecasted for the next decades. The operations are 100% green and self-sustainable when combined with novel low enthalpy geothermal power production technology. It opens a new running room to rejuvenate mature hydrocarbon basins into energy super basins.

In the latest COP 28 UN Climate Change Conference held in December 2023 in United Arab Emirates, signatory countries promised a transition from carbon energy sources "in a just, orderly and equitable manner" (UNFCC, 2023) to mitigate, accordingly, the worst effects of climate change, and reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In the history of COP summits, though vague with respect to how and when the transition will happen, the latest UN conference set a precedent in affirming the necessity of reducing the use of fossil fuels. (Though, notably, China and India, representing more than one-third of the world's population, did not sign the pledge to triple their output of renewable energy and committed to coal power instead.) Researchers from policy institutes, leading academic institutions and elsewhere have devoted significant effort to explaining the economic benefits transitioning to 'renewable' energy and pursuing the commitments made under the auspices of the UN climate change agreements. Monographs and compendiums as well offer advice on how to navigate and benefit from the transition. Some works address legal and regulatory issues such as Promoting Renewable Energy: The Mutual Supportiveness of Climate and Trade Law (Monti, 2023) or focus upon technical and engineering matters as in Fundamentals and Applications of Renewable Energy (Kanoglu et al., 2023). Looking at each of these themes in turn, we begin with the popular concept of energy security. Energy security is a recurring theme in the design of energy policy even though there is no consensus on how it should be measured or achieved, or on the relevant time frame over which it should be assessed. Ever since petroleum became critical to modern economic life, people have been concerned about whether its supply was 'secure' and would be fairly priced. Of late, such perennial concerns have been used to support renewable energy, but what 'security' precisely involves is uncertain. There are many interesting metrics and indices purporting to measure energy security. It may involve the ratio of domestic supply to domestic consumption, looking at resource estimates or metrics related to economic structure such as producer concentration, energy intensiveness and market conditions. Distinct disciplines, as well, use different metrics. We have the accessibility perspective originating in political science; the availability perspective using geologic and scientific insights; and the affordability perspective with its roots in financial economics (Cherp & Jewell, 2011). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy security signifies "the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price".1 Questioning the validity of energy market insecurity, using historical data and the statistical insights of financial option theory, some authors have argued that petroleum markets are remarkably robust and flexible, and perform well even during 'crises' (Haar & Haar, 2019). Concerns over security are unwarranted and reliance upon imports is not problematic (Robinson, 2007). As we saw recently when Russia invaded Ukraine, prices did not exceed previous highs, markets cleared without excess demand and supply. Though there many perspectives on the concept of energy security, and concerns over it may be arguably unjustified, a common theme running through the renewable energy research and advocacy found in the publications under review is that energy markets are inherently insecure, but renewable energy will address this problem.2 George Hathry opens his work by claiming that both companies and countries will enhance energy security through renewable energy. This claim is also made in the collection edited by Pablo Del Río and Mario Ragwitz (p. 3.) Similarly, in the work edited and authored by Anton Eberhard and Wikus Kruger various authors claim that only through private investment in renewable energy can the energy insecurity of the nations of the Global South be addressed (p. 2.). Further, it is argued that Brazil can address insecurity in electricity supply through renewable energy (p. 290), even though it has 16,172,000 million cubic feet (mmcf) of gas reserves and produces 3.3 million barrels per day (mmbd) of oil; or that Namibia can address its insecurity of electricity supply through displacing imported electricity from South Africa or imported petroleum or natural gas with renewable energy (p. 405) even though Angola, its northern neighbour has 9,711,000 mmcf of gas reserves and produces 1.4 mmbd of oil. Further, in 2021 the Canadian firm Reconnaissance Africa discovered in Namibia 120 billion barrels of oil in the Kango basin. Argentina has 11,142,000 mmcf of natural gas and produces over half a million barrels of oil per day (mmbd) while Brazil has 16,172,000 mmcf of gas reserves and produces 3.3 mmbd of oil. The premise of the proposition that renewable energy is a means of addressing supply insecurity is dubious: most countries are net importers of petroleum, as it is critical to energy and the petrochemical sectors of modern economies, and the global 100 mmbd market is remarkably flexible. Though the purpose of sanctions against Russia was to reduce its revenues from petroleum, with the unintended consequences that its discounted Urals crude went east while Europe found new sources, the events attest to the depth and liquidity of the market. The countries of the Global South that Eberhard and Kruger focus on have bountiful access and supplies of hydrocarbons. International energy markets are not 'insecure' as renewable energy advocates claim; and replacing low-cost imported energy or domestically produced hydrocarbons with expensive renewable energy, as explained below, conflicts with the received economic theory of trade. That energy may be imported does not make it 'insecure', and replacing it through renewable energy may not be economic.3 Although a scenario in which China stops exporting solar PV panels appears remote, we should remember that generating electricity in this manner, like relying upon wind turbines, involves international trade in energy intensive, globally sourced materials.4 Not surprisingly, in all three works we find the theme that transitioning to renewable energy will help the environment by reducing GHG. Georges Hathry begins with this message, as do Pablo Del Río and Mario Ragwitz, whose introductory chapter tells us that satisfying the Paris Agreement of 2015 and achieving sustainable development goals requires transformation of our global energy production and consumption system. In Eberhard and Kruger's collection, the role of the Global South in reducing GHG is a recurring theme. In the eight countries examined – Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, India, South Africa, Zambia, and Namibia – the respective authors, as area experts, explain how private investment and market mechanisms may be used to reduce CO2 emissions, demonstrating commitment to the various COP objectives. Excluding India from the examined countries in the Eberhard and Kruger collection, the CO2 emissions of the other seven countries sum to less than 4.5 per cent of global CO2.5 Even the United Kingdom, with the sixth-largest GDP, contributes only 1 per cent to global CO2. Though it may appear meritorious to act locally while imagining a global impact, the facts are not supportive. Arguably, the alternative to 'free riding' should be global cooperation. For countries of the Global South covered in Eberhard and Kruger's work, investing in renewable energy will have no measurable impact upon atmospheric CO2 or prevent climate change. If the incentives and subsidies being offered to developing countries to adopt renewable technologies in general were instead directed to the world's most-emitting sectors, there would be greater CO2 reduction at a lower cost. A global agreement on the taxation of CO2 might be one approach (Shackleton, 2020), and, in contrast to technology-specific incentives, taxing carbon ensures that firms and sectors with the lowest costs of abatement act first. In contrast, offering incentives for renewable energy, grid-level battery storage or carbon sequestration involves governments picking winners – Hayek's 'pretence of knowledge'. Moreover, disaggregating the effects of policies from general economic trends is challenging and assumption-intensive (Moutinho et al., 2015). Perhaps these authors should recall the observation of the late Professor Milton Friedman: "One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results."6 Apart from achieving COP objectives, the economic case for investing in renewable energy in the Global South remains questionable especially given its minuscule contribution to global CO2. Even in Europe, independently pursuing COP objectives may appear environmentally virtuous, but is devoid of economic common sense. Altogether, it echoes Marx's mantra: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.' From pre-industrial times to the 1950s, global levels of atmospheric CO2 hovered around 300 parts per million or 0.03 per cent of the atmosphere. It has now grown to around 400 parts per million or 0.04 per cent of the atmosphere. Though CO2, as a by-product of the chemical reaction known as combustion, was never a concern until it was associated with climate change, the replacement of technologies using fossil fuels with renewable energy technologies is commonly portrayed as a 'win-win', that is, the costs of climate change are averted, and it is better and cheaper than fossil fuels. In all three works, in both presumptions and overt claims, it is argued that the cost of energy will be reduced through reliance upon solar PV and wind-turbine generated electricity. Hathry makes this claim in his chapter 3. Eberhard and Kruger's collection tells us that the reliance upon market mechanisms has facilitated investment and provided cost-efficient electricity tariffs for the provision of clean, renewably generated electricity. According to the authors in the Eberhard and Kruger collection, the criterion for successful implementation of renewable energy is that an independent power project is built and achieves 'commercial' operation in a timely manner and offers a low, competitive price of electricity, critically defined using the metric of the IEA and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The indirect 'ancillary' costs of providing system balancing and backup as well as network costs are mentioned along with their inevitable 'socialisation', that is, the impact upon consumers, but considered in depth. According to the various contributors, renewable energy is successful if the agreed tariff price is similar to or slightly below the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of the relevant technology, that is, wind turbines or solar.7 But does this criterion measure ensure economic merit? Properly, the use of this criterion ensures only that the prices received by investors–developers of renewable energy reflect their respective costs including an adequate return to capital; it does not imply that such a price will be cheaper, the same as, or more expensive than other forms of electricity generation, like dispatchable fossil-fuel plants or nuclear (US EIA, 2022). To elaborate, while renewable energy is often presented as competitive with fossil-fuel-fired electricity generation, this assertion confuses price per installed megawatt with price per megawatt hour, as determined through the aforementioned LCOE calculation. Remember, though its 'fuel' is free, the significant capital requirements are not. Moreover, even in sunny Africa or Brazil, solar PV does not work at night. In most parts of the world, on-shore wind operates approximately one-quarter of the time and off-shore wind about a third of the time. For heuristic purposes, if we assume a weighted capacity average of 25 per cent, we might imagine that constructing four times capacity would yield nearly the same output of one gas-fired turbine normally operating at a typical load factor of 90 per cent. The observation, however, assumes zero correlation between the four sites. Weather patterns are not uncorrelated, requiring instead that one might need a sixfold investment in wind or solar renewable capacity to generate as much electricity as a single gas turbine of the same megawatts. So, while the price of installed capacity has fallen for renewable technology, an LCOE-type calculation of dividing the cost of capacity by the number of hours to reach an average cost, shows that renewable energy is not cheap. Even with Pigouvian-style taxation of CO2 and other effluents, if it were technologically superior to dispatchable plant like combined-cycle gas turbines and ultra-supercritical coal, debating how it should be supported would be a moot issue. Comparing LCOE of various forms of generation, however, does not tell the whole story of their respective merits. Though the authors of the Eberhard and Kruger collection acknowledge the indirect costs of renewable energy investment and that such costs may be 'socialised' (that is, paid for by consumers), the matter is given limited attention. It cannot be ignored, however. In the Del Río and Ragwitz collection, such topics are explored in depth. In chapter 2, titled 'The Costs and Benefits of the Energy Transition', by Barbara Breitschopf, Julia Panny and Anne Held, we have a detailed analysis and explanation of why renewable energy has huge indirect costs. Further, in chapter 8, titled 'The Grid Costs of Renewable Energy Deployment', by Joan Batalla-Bejerano, Daniel Davi-Arderius and Elisa Trujillo-Baute, we find a detailed explanation and analysis of the infrastructure needed to make renewable energy generation workable. We learn that, as a highly distributed form of electricity generation, it requires vast investment in transmission cables estimated to cost for overhead lines approximately £600,000 per kilometre, ignoring life-cycle costs. Further, it requires fossil-fuel plants idling at minimum stable generation to be dispatchable when the wind-generated output fails and the sun does not shine. In the UK, according to the energy regulator Ofgem, the non-wholesale cost component of retail energy prices now exceeds 71 per cent.8 The costs of random intermittency associated with renewable technologies cannot be overestimated. Argentina has 2,534 hours per year of sunshine; 71 per cent of the time it is either night or under cloud cover. India has 2,361; 73 per cent of the time it is either night or under cloud cover. Even in Zambia, 68 per cent of the time cloud and nightfall may render solar PV infrastructure useless. Though it may be observed that in parts of Africa and India renewable energy will be a primary source of electricity without grid-level backup, making it cheaper, it is still hard to imagine anyone being satisfied with an intermittent and unpredictable supply. While in Argentina, South Africa and Brazil consumers living in urbanised areas expect reliable supply, renewable energy will require fossil-fuel backup or massive investment in grid-level storage, both of which impose huge social costs.9 Turning to Europe, it has been estimated that providing dispatchable backup to intermittent renewable energy is costing tens of billions of euros per annum (Haar & Haar, 2017). According to recently published data by the IEA at the University of Cologne, Germany faces a €60 billion funding gap in its support for renewable energy and will need to spend about €10 billion of that on new gas-fired and hydrogen backup plants when low wind speeds or clouds keep windmills and solar panels from contributing to the grid. Further, for Germany, the social costs of reaching net zero by 2030 are estimated to reach €1.9 trillion, or €240 billion per year.10 To summarise, only one of the three publications provides realistic insights into what transitioning to renewable generation of electricity will cost. 'Socialisation' of indirect costs may sound inoffensive, but when one quantifies the facts the case for using renewables to decarbonise electricity generation is undermined, especially in the lower- and middle-income countries of the Global South. From a democratic governance perspective, one wonders how citizens of the Global South would respond if they were canvassed on the trade-offs in transitioning to renewable energy. As we have witnessed in the world's most advanced economies, since the Industrial Revolution economic growth has been supported through inexpensive fossil fuels. Viewed comprehensively, the cost of energy will not be reduced through reliance upon solar PV and wind-turbine-generated electricity, and reliance upon it in developing countries will not make them richer. If it were economic to generate electricity using renewable technology rather than natural gas, petroleum or coal, it would not need policy advocacy; businesses do not require incentives to pursue profits. Reflecting the widespread transition to the privatisation of electricity generation from state-owned utilities and the use of market forces to deliver reliable and affordable electricity, in all three works reviewed a large role is accorded to private investors and capital in achieving the transition to wind and solar renewable-electricity generation. Hathry targets private entities and addresses how renewable energy projects may be undertaken at firm level. He discusses how to measure energy consumption and the potential savings from renewable energy. Unsurprisingly, the public relations benefits of using and generating renewable energy are also emphasised. A case study in Hathry's work of the major French conglomerate the Bollore Group demonstrates the alleged benefits in this regard. Lacking, however, in Hathry's work are the larger financial-economic as well as macro insights. It may look good to customers for a firm to signal its virtue of being conscientiously green, but how could higher energy prices really be good for stakeholders if it increases costs? The ultimate incidence must impact consumers, shareholders and employees. Further, we have the burden of the indirect costs of renewably generated electricity, as already explained. In most cases firms are receiving tax credits, subsidies, and other inducements to use or adopt renewable energy. Such incentives have a cost: a subsidy for one entity means higher taxes for another entity. Such incentives may have misallocative effects, directing capital in a suboptimal manner. Commenting upon the upcoming Davos Meeting, the President and CEO of Huntsman Corporation, a publicly traded petrochemical manufacturer, said "the pursuit of green energy is leading to the rapid de-industrialisation of Europe" (Huntsman, 2024). The German think tank Agora Energiewende (2024) reported that the fall in Europe's CO2 output is primarily due to deindustrialisation. Promoting one's green credentials might yield positive public perceptions, but the costs lead to economic stagnation. Major European car makers have already voiced concerns that the battery-powered vehicle will be the death of the domestic car industry (Fairless, 2024). In addition, Hathry's perspective ignores the impact upon consumers. Higher prices for domestic energy and transportation reduce the purchasing power of consumers, which cannot be good for businesses. Discretionary consumer purchases such as clothing, hospitality, entertainment have been affected by higher energy prices. In the UK thousands of pubs have shut their doors, blaming the cost of heating (Cobham, 2024). Taking a general equilibrium perspective, apart from the direct beneficiaries of renewable energy investments such as investors earning low-risk subsidised returns, through altering relative prices from their natural opportunity cost and directing capital to where it would not go without incentives, the promotion of renewable energy must have a net negative impact to a country. Even arguments with respect to job creation through renewable energy require major qualifications (Stanef-Puica et al., 2022). Chapter 7 in the Del Río and Ragwitz collection ('Green Jobs in the Spanish Renewable Energy Sector: An Input-Output Approach' by Manuel Tomás, Ignacio Cazcarro, Julen Montilla, Cristina Pizarro-Irizar and Iñaki Arto) shows the challenges of measuring the employment impact of renewable energy programmes. Simple mantras claiming that supporting renewable energy will create 'green jobs' are not useful. Like many targeted government programmes, identifying the cohort of beneficiaries is easier than showing the widespread negative impact upon contributors and payers. Cynically, such benefits are transitory while the costs, like deindustrialisation and impoverishment, are persistent, difficult to measure and beyond the election cycle. Though Hathry's observations are of a general nature, the focus of the many authors in the Eberhard and Kruger collection is on how the use of energy auctions may encourage private investors in renewable energy, particularly in the nations of the Global South. Covering Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, India, South Africa, Zambia and Namibia, the respective authors, as area experts, provide detailed and well-explained information on the design, implementation, and outcomes of renewable energy auctions in each of these important locations. Each country-specific chapter provides a mixture of facts, casual empiricism and contextual information on the structure and performance of the existing power generation sector. The detailed information is generously supported by excellent graphs, tables and other exhibits, giving the reader useful insights into how each of these countries sought to address inadequate electricity supply through reliance upon market mechanisms and private capital. The information supplied and observations made do not demonstrate the economic rationality of these investment programmes. From this work, we learn that renewable energy auctions have become the main approach to contracting utility-scale renewable energy projects. The recent history of auction markets in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and India are appraised and analysed with the aim of improving how they are designed and implemented globally. In each country the focus is on policy choices including how the auction was implemented, what institutions were involved and how the procurement process was undertaken. After decades of reliance upon state-owned or parastatal entities, for all these countries turning to the private sector to supply electricity and relying upon a market mechanism to set the price was a watershed. As a natural monopoly suitable for either public ownership or regulated private ownership, there was a history of antipathy to using the private sector to supply electricity and a market mechanism to set prices. As we learn from Eberhard and Kruger's collection, in some countries private investment focusing upon renewable energy was intended to address chronic load-shedding and deficient performance of the established state-owned monopoly. In India, we discover that the auction process initially was complicated by the autonomy of India's state authorities, but eventually the ambitions to reduce the cost of renewable energy, to attract investors and have projects completed in a timely manner were successful. Facilitating India's programme was the socialisation of direct and indirect system support cost; rather than imposing such costs upon developers, a 'plug-and-play' option for developers: government agencies provided land and transmission connection. In some countries, conditions were already favourable to using private capital and auctions to facilitate renewable energy development; in other countries, new laws, regulations and institution were required. In Chile, we learn that the combination of a positive business climate, low country risk, low non-payment rates and a supportive regulatory system helped to protect revenue streams to suppliers. With advanced capital markets and economic sophistication, successful auctions of the right to build and generate renewable electricity in South Africa should have been straightforward, but attracting private sector investment faced several obstacles. Though South Africa had been the regional leader in renewable energy auctions, establishing the Independent Power Producer Programme in late 2010 to address chronic power shortages as well as demonstrating commitment to UN Climate Change Conference (COP 15), its site selection process was cumbersome and costly for unsuccessful bidders. Further, its compliance programme was complicated while bidder ranking and winner selection was insufficiently transparent, discouraging investors from future rounds. In countries such as Brazil and Mexico, major structural reforms of the electricity sector, including vertical unbundling of supply from transmission and distribution, were needed to provide suitable and attractive conditions for private investors. In Mexico, an energy regulator was created along with a market operator, and the state-owned utility was segmented into independent entities overseeing various parts of the value chain. In Argentina, the long history of economic instability and institutional fragility presented obstacles necessitating the creation of trust fund by the World Bank to mitigate financial risk to investors. It was successful in facilitating auctions until the crash of 2018 proved it was insufficient to protect investors from sovereign risk. In Namibia, starting from a complete absence of private sector involvement in electricity supply as of 2015, tangible progress was made using innovative financial structures developed by the Standard Bank to lend in the local currency, shielding investors from foreign exchange-rate risk. In neighbouring Zambia, an innovative approach to auction design was used to mitigate key risks and build trust among potential investors. In sum, from the collection we learn that renewable energy auctions have become the dominant method for contracting utility-scale renewable energy projects, in large part due to the 'cost-efficient' tariffs secured through this method. Relying upon private capital and market mechanisms, progress in renewable energy by the countries of the Global South has been remarkable, but does this tell the entire story? While these countries have used a market mechanism to encourage renewable energy investment and relied upon the private sector to build renewable generation, often using the LCOE for renewables as a benchmark for setting prices of renewables, this does not necessarily demonstrate sound economics. The authors in the Eberhard and Kruger collection avoid the salient issue of whether promoting renewable energy, even using market mechanisms, favours prosperity, growth and development. In seeking guidance from this publication, policymakers should reflect carefully. Though encouraging investment in renewable energy through auctions supports achieving COP 15 objectives, the authors in the Eberhard and Kruger collection ignore the issue of whether it supports long-term economic growth and development in their respective economies. Does it build wealth or just encourage rent-seeking? In addition to gas-fired generation being cheaper when considered comprehensively, the geography and geology of these countries makes one wonder why they should pursue renewable energy, if not for achieving UN sustainable development goals or finding favour with NGOs. Argentina, as mentioned, has huge exploitable natural gas and oil reserves. So does Brazil.11 Mexico produces over 1.7 mmbd of oil and ranks just ahead of Brazil in having 16,549,000 mmcf of gas reserves. Angola, the northern neighbour of Namibia, has 9,711,000 mmcf of gas reserves and produces 1.4 mmbd of oil. Though Zambia has a tiny oil and gas industry, its neighbour Mozambique is estimated to have 100 million mmcf of gas reserves, ranking 14th in the world. Altogether, the plentiful supply of hydrocarbons suitable for gas-fired electricity generation, either within or available from neighbouring countries, raises the question of whether unreliable distributed generation of electricity makes sense. The LCOE may be comparable, but it still requires massive investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure as well as dispatchable backup. For long-term economic growth, would renewable energy in the countries of the Global South, or anywhere for that matter, make sense if we were not concerned with the impact of using fossil fuels to generate electricity? While all the authors in Eberhard and Kruger's collection acknowledge that renewable energy has ancillary and network costs, they all seem complacent about the above concerns. Yes, according to Deason (2018) in a meta-analysis of 45 peer-reviewed studies on the impact of renewable energy, 34 found that full reliance upon renewable energy would increase electricity prices between 41 per cent and 104 per cent. More broadly, according to Alex Epstein (2021), replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will condemn much of the developing world to eternal poverty. Apart from achieving COP objectives, the economic case for pursuing renewable energy in the Global South remains questionable especially given its minuscule contribution to global CO2. Perhaps reflecting the level of governance and democracy, the various governments covered by Eberhard and Kruger appear committed to increasing renewable energy output without regard for the costs imposed on consumers of electricity and the long-term implications for economic growth. This also raises the question of how well the citizens of Europe and North America appreciate the negative impact of eliminating fossil fuels from electricity generation. Reflecting the commitments to the COP/renewable energy agenda, researchers from policy institutes, leading academic institutions and elsewhere have devoted great effort to explaining the economic benefits of transitioning to 'renewable' energy and pursuing the commitments made under the auspices of the UN climate change agreements. The three works reviewed here offer detailed insights and advice on how the transition may be facilitated. Intended for policymakers and academics, the two edited collections are by far the most rigorous, with the one edited by Pablo Del Río and Mario Ragwitz the most balanced, offering detailed insights into the costs of transforming how we generate electricity as well as such key topics as employment creation. The collection edited by the University of Cape Town professors Anton Eberhard and Wikus Kruger provides detailed insights into how various countries of the Global South have used market mechanisms and private capital to engender renewable investment. Notwithstanding the use of market mechanisms, whether such policies and programmes are beneficial, offering sound economics, is given limited emphasis. The shorter work of Georges Hathry has a different audience: the business executive wishing to know more about renewable energy and why his or her firm should become engaged. It is uncritical and limited in its outlook, but the case studies are interesting, providing guidance on how and why one should proceed. In sum, short of a technological breakthrough like sustainable fusion energy, these works show that the devotion to renewable energy may require more faith than rationality. Perhaps we should recall the words of the Spanish poet Miguel de Unamuno: 'Faith which does not doubt is dead faith.'

Liquid metals—that is, metals with low melting points—have fascinating and unique properties. Gallium is one of the most popular liquid metals because it melts near room temperature, has low toxicity, effectively zero vapor pressure, and can be combined with other metals to form alloys. The term "liquid metal" can be more broadly defined to include metals that melt at temperatures that are easy to access under common laboratory conditions. Room-temperature liquid metals open unique possibilities to leverage the soft, fluidic characteristics of liquids while simultaneously taking advantage of properties like high surface energy and thin oxide layers, high electrical and thermal conductivity, and other metallic characteristics that are typically reserved for rigid, solid materials. This liquid-metallic combination has resulted in remarkable properties, unusual behaviors, and new materials and devices that cannot be created with typical fluids or common metals alone. Interest in liquid metals has grown over the last decade due to the interest in applications that take advantage of their properties. For example, liquid metals can be used as conductors and components in soft and stretchable electronics. Likewise, they can be used for soft biomedical devices, energy harvesting devices, and e-textiles. Liquid metals can help catalyze reactions in unique ways and have interfacial properties that can be exploited for a variety of applications, such as actuators, batteries, and substrates for the deposition of thin films. The versatility of liquid metals presents many opportunities for future materials, devices, and systems, and represents an exciting paradigm for both scientific exploration and the creation of novel technologies. The special issue on Liquid Metals for Functional Materials consists of 49 manuscripts with 37 research articles and 12 reviews across a wide breadth of the liquid metal field. The work focuses on the latest advancements from fundamental properties to applied concepts, as broadly classified as Energy and Electrochemistry, Biomedical and Healthcare, Catalysts and Reactions, Composites and Multiphase Materials, Electronics and Conductors, Fabrication and Patterning, and Interfacial Properties. This collection highlights the multidisciplinary nature of liquid metal research and provides a platform to showcase our current understanding and outline future directions. We sincerely thank Dr. Joseph Krumpfer and Dr. Esther Levy, whose dedication to this special issue energized this effort and led to the exciting collection of papers presented in this special issue. Below, we will briefly highlight the contents of the special issue through the lens of several of the key subtopics in the field. Liquid metals offer promising potential in future energy storage and harvesting. Their electrical conductivity, deformability, compatibility with electrochemistry, lithium dissolution capability, and the possibility of creating porous composites make them ideal materials for efficient ion and electron exchanges. The addition of small metallic components can significantly alter the electrochemical behavior of liquid metals. In a work published in this special issue, Tang and co-workers showed the modulation of electrochemical properties by studying fractals that are formed from liquid metal alloys (adfm.202301348). In another work, Li and co-workers presented mixtures of MXene with EGaIn for energy-harvesting (adfm.202307830). Additionally, Boley and co-workers created a galvanic cell by mechanically rupturing surface oxide of liquid metals to convert chemical energy to electrical energy (adfm.202309177). Quality of electrical conductivity and stretchability are important factors in textile-based electronics with embedded supercapacitors, which are carefully investigated in another work by So and co-workers (adfm.202310318). An interesting paper by Deng and co-workers presented the application of liquid metals for forming elastomer seals in stretchable lithium-ion storage units (adfm.202309861). Finally, the special issue includes a review by Yan and co-workers on advances in energy storage based on liquid metal systems (adfm.202309706). The low toxicity of gallium-based liquid metals makes them suitable for medical applications. The use of liquid metals in these areas has been growing in popularity, and this issue features several papers that review recent biomedicine-related liquid metal works. For example, one paper by Seo and co-workers summarized the use of low-melting-point metals for biomedical applications (adfm.202307708). One paper by Park and co-workers reviewed the usage of gallium-based liquid metals for bioelectronics (adfm.202307990) while another paper by Lim and co-workers reviewed healthcare-related applications of liquid metals in wearables and soft robotics (adfm.202309989). Additionally, Wei and co-workers reviewed liquid metal-based biosensors (adfm.202308173). In more specific applications, Truong and co-workers created silver-gallium amalgamated particles that show antibacterial properties and show promise as a spray-coating on implantable devices (adfm.202310539). In another work by Markvicka and co-workers, composites of elastomers and liquid metals were developed with acoustic properties that improve the image quality of wearable ultrasound devices for long-term patient monitoring (adfm.202308954). Additionally, liquid-metal electrodes and particles were used by Kim and co-workers to create soft biosensors capable of detecting ascorbic and uric acid, dopamine, and glucose (adfm.202311696). Currently, a significant portion of global greenhouse emissions and energy consumption stems from industrial-scale chemical reactions used in the production of ammonia, fuel, hydrogen, polymers, and other chemicals. Progress in enhancing catalysis and reaction rates using solid materials has been limited. Exploring the untapped properties of liquid metals holds great promise for introducing new paradigms in these chemical processes. Researchers offered several interesting works in this special issue on catalysts and reactions using liquid metals. Here, Daeneke and co-workers showed a delicate liquid metal system with incorporated copper for electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol (adfm.202304248). Kalantar-Zadeh and co-workers demonstrated that liquid metal can be used as the reservoir for zinc metal for sourcing it into the synthesis metal–organic frameworks (adfm.202300969). While another study put forward by Yarema and co-workers presented an approach to use liquid metal to create Pd-Zn nanocrystals (adfm.202309018). In another seminal manuscript, Sitti and co-workers utilized liquid metal initiated polymerization to create hydrogel composites (adfm.202308238). A liquid metal reaction media was also used by Zavabeti and co-workers for the creation of atomically thin bismuth oxides that enabled strong piezoelectric systems (adfm.202307348). O'Mullane and co-workers showed that liquid metals have a potential use in plasma-assisted carbon dioxide reduction by incorporating liquid metal droplets (adfm.202307846). The capabilities of liquid metals are not just limited to inorganic systems. Miyako and co-workers showed that liquid metal catalysts can also be effectively used in immunostimulants (adfm.202305886). Liquid metal can be combined with diverse components such as polymers, metals, carbon-based materials, or other organic or inorganic materials to create composites and multiphase systems. This can create novel composites with enhanced functional or mechanical properties relative to solid-based inclusions or other phases can be added into liquid metal to provide new properties not native to liquid metal. These concepts were well captured in the special issue. One review by Kramer-Bottiglio and co-workers focused on multiphase composites containing liquid metal and other (x) fillers for unique combinations of properties (adfm.202309529) while another review by Lee and co-workers showed how adding particles into liquid metal can create magnetic liquid metal (adfm.202311153). A third review by Tee and co-workers discussed liquid metal composites for wearable electronics (adfm.202400284). Additionally, a set of papers presented liquid-metal polymer composites with different functionalities. One work by Bartlett and co-workers showed how liquid-metal droplets in elastomers could create electrically conductive reversible adhesives for soft electronics (adfm.202304101), while another by Li and co-workers showed hydrogel composites with high toughness and conductivity (adfm.202308113). This polymer composite architecture also enabled thermally stable soft materials for high-temperature applications as presented by Majidi and co-workers (adfm.202309725) while Zhou and co-workers used liquid metal droplets as cross-links to enable recyclable conductive composites (adfm.202308032). The high deformability of liquid metal wires was also used in conjunction with a magnetic soft composite by Park and co-workers to create artificial muscles (adfm.202302895). Like solid metals, liquid metals have a high electrical conductivity, making them suitable as conductors in electronics, but with the added properties of liquids, such as discretization into droplets. One review by Hussain and co-workers examined liquid-metal droplets and their use for electronics such as sensors, switches, transistors, actuators, and more (adfm.202308116). Liquid metals are also especially suitable for soft, flexible, and stretchable electronics. Toward this, Zhang and co-workers created a soft, lightweight composite with networks of liquid-metal fibers (adfm.202308128) while Zhang and co-workers developed liquid-metal composite materials that show increased conductivity with applied strain (adfm.202310225). In another contribution, Zheng and co-workers demonstrated a permeable and stretchable liquid-metal fibers for sensors and other electronics (adfm.202308120). Bartlett and co-workers presented a liquid metal-based conductive adhesive for integration of soft electronics and rigid devices (adfm.202313567) while Hjort and co-workers presented a laser engraving methodology for creating liquid metal-based interconnects (adfm.202309707). Other papers in this issue describe the use of liquid metals in specific electronic devices. One review presented by Park and co-workers examined liquid-metal systems that respond to a variety of stimuli, and that can be used for electronics such as wearable sensors (adfm.202308703). The compliant nature of liquid metal was used by Lacour and co-workers to make sensors that can measure softness (adfm.202308698). A liquid-metal inductive sensor was created by Jeong and co-workers that is capable of distinguishing between various stimuli on a finger (adfm.202305776), and a wearable liquid-metal antenna was directly printed by Hashimoto and co-workers (adfm.202311219). Liquid metals can be patterned into useful shapes such as circuits, antennas, and wires to create soft and stretchable analogs to existing electronic devices. Relative to conventional metals, such as copper or aluminum, the fluidic nature of liquid metal allows it to be patterned in unique ways, including injection and 3D printing. In many cases, patterning is facilitated by the thin, solid oxide layer that forms rapidly on the surface of liquid metals in the presence of oxygen. This solid oxide "skin" allows the liquid metal to retain shapes that would normally be impossible with liquids due to surface tension. This special issue offers several interesting works on the fabrication and patterning of liquid metals. Liquid metals were 3D printed in ceramics by Yang and co-workers for use in microwave absorption (adfm.202307499). In another example, Syed and co-workers separated the oxide layer from the liquid metal to enable the fabrication of gas sensors (adfm.202309342). Park and co-workers also took advantage of the ability to use liquid metal particles to pattern stretchable electronics (adfm.202309660). The particles can be used to make thermally conductive composites as demonstrated by Lee and co-workers (adfm.202306698) or be cast as a film and subsequently merged together to form conductive traces as presented by Dickey and co-workers (adfm.202308574). Liquid metals have remarkable interfacial properties. For example, they have the largest interfacial tension of any liquid at room temperature, with values nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of water. Yet, the surface tension effectively can be lowered to near zero by using electrochemical oxidation. This phenomenon, as well as several others, can be used to control the flow and shape of liquid metal, as reviewed by Wang and co-workers in this special issue (adfm.202309614). In addition, studies by Daniels and co-workers provide new insights into this electrochemical phenomenon by carefully measuring the tension as a function of electrical potential (adfm.202311501) or by confining the metal to porous tubes as demonstrated by Khan and co-workers (adfm.202307919). Another interesting property of liquid metals is that they can react to form surface oxides on their surface. Herein, Tabor and co-workers enhance the mechanical strength of the skin by depositing thin silica layers on the oxide (adfm.202308167). Further, Elbourne and co-workers evaluated the structure of the oxide on liquid metal droplets (adfm.202310147) while Koo and co-workers utilized the oxide-coated liquid metal to form more stable solar cells (adfm.202311597). We are grateful for all the authors, reviewers, and editors who made this special issue possible. We hope this special issue will help highlight the challenges and exciting opportunities for the development and utilization of liquid metal in diverse applications.

 BACKGROUND Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma that primarily arises within or after the germinal center[1]. While Burkitt’s lymphoma is considered rare in China, it constitutes 30%-50% of childhood tumors in Africa, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO)[2, 3]. Unfortunately, the incidence of this condition has been steadily increasing, posing a significant threat to human health[4]. It should be emphasized that a significant number of individuals diagnosed with Burkitt’s lymphoma are already in the advanced stages of the disease (stages III to IV) when they seek medical attention[5]. Although chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment, the effectiveness of medical treatments and predicted outcomes for individuals with advanced-stage illnesses and refractory recurrence are far from satisfactory[6, 7]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further research on the pathogenesis of Burkitt’s lymphoma, with a focus on identifying potential therapeutic targets via gateway molecules. EBV infection plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of BL, exerting a profound influence on the development of B-cell malignancy[8, 9]. Based on clinical manifestations, geographical distribution, infection patterns, and immune status, BL has been categorized into three distinct subtypes by WHO: endemic (Burkitt’s lymphoma), sporadic (Burkitt’s lymphoma), and immunodeficient-associated (ID-Burkitt’s lymphoma)[10]. EBV is found in approximately 95% of eBurkitt lymphoma cases, 20%-30% of sBurkitt lymphoma cases, and 25%-40% of ID-Burkitt lymphoma cases[11, 12]. Notably, nearly 100% of children with endemic BL demonstrate the existence of EBV infection[13, 14]. Nevertheless, the exact function of EBV infection in the cause of BL is still not be fully elucidated. EBV is the first virus to possess microRNAs (miRNAs) in its genome. These mature miRNAs are primarily encoded by two gene groups, namely, BamHI Fragment H Rightward Open Reading Frame 1 (BHRF1) and BamHI-A Region Rightward Transcript (BART). BHRF1 encodes only four miRNAs, whereas the remaining miRNAs are encoded by BARTs[15, 16]. The BART gene contains 22 precursor miRNAs (miR-BART 1-22), which can generate 44 mature miRNAs, all of which are highly expressed in EBV-associated lymphoma[17]. Studies have shown that in Akata cells, miR-BART10-3p[18] can target BHRF1, inhibit EBV replication and B lymphocytes, and reduce immune clearance. Additionally, EBV can directly or indirectly affect various tumor-related genes, such as the BIM tumor suppressor gene and the TCL-1 oncogene, in B lymphocytes, contributing to its carcinogenic role [19-22]. Zhang et al. found that EBV-miR-BART6-3p and miR-197 had a synergistic effect on reducing IL-6R in Burkitt lymphoma[23, 24]. Another study discovered that miR-BART6-3p can downregulate PTEN to encourage the growth of EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells [25]. Furthermore, in Burkitt lymphoma cells (Raji), miR-BART20-5P can silence the BCL-2 related death promoter BAD gene, leading to anti-apoptotic effects [26]. The abnormal expression of EBV-miRNA-BARTs in Burkitt lymphoma suggests their crucial role in tumorigenesis and development[27-29]. Yet, in regards to Burkitt lymphoma, the specific mechanisms of action and target genes controlled by these miRNAs have not been thoroughly investigated. The cell cycle is the basic process of cell life activities, which includes two stages, cell division and cell growth, and is crucial for cell growth, division, and repair[30]. The regulatory mechanisms of the cell cycle are complex and involve the interaction of multiple genes and proteins, including CDK1 and cyclinD1[31, 32]. EBV is closely associated with the cell cycle[33]. Some studies have pointed out that EBV can also regulate the latent genes required for B-cell immortalization, thus affecting the cell cycle[34]. Therefore, an in-depth study of the relationship between EBV and the cell cycle is helpful to explore the pathogenesis of EBV infection-related diseases and to provide new ideas for treatment.   OBJECTIVE Background: EB virus infection runs through the entire process of B-cell malignant Burkitt lymphoma. The role of EBV-miRNA-BART5-3p has been investigated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric cancer, but has not been studied in Burkitt lymphoma. The primary aim of this study was to explore the impact of EBV-miRNA-BART5-3p on the progression of Burkitt lymphoma. Methods: We observed the upregulation of EBV-miR-BART5-3p in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cells using a range of methodologies, including the use of a bioinformatics tool, real-time PCR, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry analysis. The effects and underlying mechanisms of BART5-3p in Burkitt’s lymphoma were further investigated through exogenous overexpression or inhibition in cells. Results: In this study, we detected BART5-3p was highly expressed and decrease P53 levels in Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells. A higher level of BART5-3p can downregulate P53 and is significantly associated with cell proliferation. In addition, flow cytometry analysis revealed that BART5-3p may regulate the cell cycle of Burkitt lymphoma cells by downregulating P53 through the flow cytometry analysis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that EBV-miR-BART5-3p contributes to dysregulation of the cell cycle and proliferation in Burkitt’s lymphoma cells by directly downregulating P53, thereby providing a potential prognostic target for EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma patients.   METHODS Cell line and cell culture Two EBV-negative BL cell lines were obtained from Shanghai Fuheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and Henan Engineering Research Center of Industrial Microbiology, respectively, and named Ramos and CA46. The EBV-positive BL cell line Raji was purchased from the Cell Bank of the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). HEK293T cells were originally obtained from Guangzhou Cellcook Biotech Co., Ltd. and were grown in a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Every Green, Zhejiang, China) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; BasalMedia). The other cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 (BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Target estimation Employing accession number NM_000546.6, the TP53 sequence utilized to predict miRNA targets was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). EBV-miRNA-BART5-3p sequence was obtained from miRBase (MIMAT0009205). The RNAhybrid program (http://bibiserv. techfak. uni-biele. org. de/rnahybrid/) was used to estimate the relationship and minimum energy-free hybridization of miRNAs and target RNAs. Lentivirus transductions Lentiviral particles containing the BART5-3p precursor and related control were provided by Prof. Wenqiang Yu from Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Lentiviral particles were generated using the GV209 plasmid containing the H1-MCS-CMV-EGFP construct. Lentiviral particles were transduced into Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid preparation and cell transfection A TIANprep Midi Plasmid Kit (TIANGEN, China) was used to purify plasmid DNAs. Plasmid DNA (200 ng of plasmid DNA was transfected using Invitrogen's Lipofectamine 2000 reagent in Ramos-BART5-3p and CA46-BART5-3p cells. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were performed to verify the levels of BART5-3p 48 hours after transfection. For the transfection of the BART5-3p inhibitor, P53 inhibitor, and their corresponding negative controls (NCs), cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at an ultimate dosage of 50 nmol/L in serum-free conditions. The medium was replaced with freshly prepared RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum four hours later. The BART5-3p inhibitor and its control, as well as the P53 inhibitor and its control inhibitor (TargetMoI), were purchased from RIBOBIO (Guangzhou, China). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 95% air and 5% CO2. RNA extraction and RT-qPCR Total Ambion's harvested USA the TRIzol reagent (Ambion, total RNA was harvested. MonScriptTM RTLLL ALL-in-One Mix with dsDNase (Monad Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used to synthesize cDNA. MonAmpTM SYBR Green qPCR Mix (Monad Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for RT-qPCR analysis. Supplementary Table 1 includes a list of the primers used for PCR. Except if otherwise noted, the data were first normalized to the level of GAPDH and then to the negative control group. Each reaction was performed three times and again in separate experiments. Relative quantification (2^(− ΔΔCt)) was performed to compute fold-changes. Dual-luciferase reporter assay The day before transfection, the cells were spread in 96-well plates, and on the second day, the cell confluence was approximately 70–80%. The following day, Hieff TransTM, reporter vector, miRNA, and serum-free medium were successively added to 96-well plates; 37℃, 5% CO2 incubator for 6h and replaced with complete medium. The firefly luciferase reaction working solution and arrilla luciferase reaction solution were prepared to detect the viability of firefly luciferase and arrilla luciferase. CCK-8 assay and EdU proliferation assay Following transfection, plates containing 96 wells were seeded at 1x104 cells per well of Ramos, CA46, and Raji cells per well. The Yeasen Biotechnology (Shan) cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) was used to measure cell proliferation. After seeding, 10 mL of CCK-8 solution was added to each well at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, the plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. After incubation, a microplate reader (Thermo MULTISKAN FC) was used to determine the absorbance at 450 nm. Proliferating BL cells were analyzed for EdU incorporation using the C0071 BeyoClickTM EDU-488 Cell Proliferation Assay Kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Transwell assay Transwell chambers with 8 mm pore filters (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) were used to evaluate the migratory ability of cells. BL cells were cultured for 48 h after transfection. Following dissociation, 1×105 cells were reconstituted in serum-free medium and inserted into Transwell chamber inserts, which had 8 µm pores. The testing chambers were then placed in wells filled with media containing 10% FBS. The cells located on the upper surface of the membrane were removed after incubation for 24 h. Cells that had moved to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet Ammonium Oxalate Solution and 1% (Solarbio). Under various microscopic conditions, the moved cells were analyzed in six randomly selected optical fields. Three independent runs were performed for each assay. Cell cycle assay A Cell Cycle Staining kit from MULTI SCIENCES was used for cell cycle detection. Initially, the cells were transfected with miRNA plasmid DNA for 48 h after they were placed into 6-well plates. Following the harvesting of 5x104 cells, 1 ml of 1x Staining buffer was added to the cells. After resuspending the cells, 4 μl of the RedNucleus I staining solution was added to the sample. The samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate and measure the stained cells following the incubation period. Western blotting Western blotting was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protease inhibitors from AbMole BioScience were added to RIPA buffer (high, Solarbio) before cells were harvested and lysed. Next, the proteins were separated using Servicebio SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Once the proteins were separated, they were placed on a PVDF membrane (Pore Size: 0.45um,). Subsequently, the PVDF membrane was examined using an initial antibody and probed with antibodies against p53 (1:10,000; 60283-2-Ig; Proteintech, China), Cyclin D1 (1:10,000; 26939-1-AP; Proteintech, China), GAPDH (1:10,000; 60004-1-Ig; Proteintech, China), and β-actin (1:50,000; 66009-1-Ig; Proteintech, China). A secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase was then used to probe it (SA00001-1; Proteintech, China), and GAPDH and β-actin served as controls for protein loading. To visualize the western blotting bands, a Servicebio Hypersensitive ECL chemiluminescence kit was used. Bands were captured using a ChemiDocTM CRS þ Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad, USA). All blots in the figures were labeled with the locations of the molecular weight/size markers. Statistical analysis.

GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for curve fitting and assessment. A significance threshold of P<0.05 was used to assess the probability of significance. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for all groups. Single, double, and triple asterisks, which represent p-values less than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively, were used to indicate the level of statistical significance.   RESULTS The expression of BART5-3p is upregulated in EBV associated BL cells To investigate the expression level of BART5-3p in BL, the experimental design was determined by performing RT-qPCR analysis of BART5-3p expression in Epstein-Barr virus-negative BL cell lines (Ramos and CA46) and Epstein-Barr virus-positive BL cells (Raji). In contrast to the other two cell lines, Raji cells showed substantially higher levels of BART5-3p expression (Figure 1a). Next, we aimed to upregulate BART5-3p levels in Ramos and CA46 cell lines using liposome-mediated transduction. We successfully generated two stable EBV-negative BL cell lines expressing BART5-3p. The transfection efficiency of BART5-3p in these two cell lines was compared to the control vector using RT-qPCR (Figure 1b), The fluorography after the transfection of BART5-3p was visualized by inverted fluorescence microscopy as shown in Figure 1c. Figure 1 | EBV-miR-BART5-3p was upregulated in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cells. (a) analysis of miR-BART5-3p levels in three cells by RT-qPCR. GAPDH was used as an internal control. (b) statistical analysis of RT-qPCR results showed significantly increased BART5-3p expression in CA46 and Ramos cells after plasmid transfection. (c) the fluorography after the transfection of BART5-3p was visualized by inverted fluorescence microscopy. Values are mean ± SD; * * *: P <0.001. Highly expressed BART5-3p dysregulates the cell cycle enhanced the proliferation of BL cells To assess the effect of BART5-3p on the growth of BL cells, we conducted CCK8 cell proliferation and EdU incorporation assays (Figure 2a and 2b). The results demonstrated that BART5-3p significantly promoted cell proliferation in both the cell lines. Importantly, according to the in vitro migration assays, BART5-3p levels markedly improved the migration of both Ramos-BART5-3p and CA46-BART5-3p compared to the respective negative controls (Figure 2c). Additionally, using flow cytometry, we examined the cell cycle phase in cells with high levels of BART5-3p to determine whether the increased cell growth induced by this substance was associated with cell cycle regulation. Cells overexpressing BART5-3p displayed a longer S phase or G2/M phase in the cell cycle distribution, along with a shorter G0/G1 phase, than the negative control cells (Figure 2d). Remarkably, western blot analysis demonstrated significantly higher protein levels of the cell cycle-related genes cyclinD1, in cells with exogenous BART5-3p expression (Figures 2e). Collectively, these findings imply that BL cell replication is stimulated by BART5-3p, potentially contributing to cancer growth by regulating the cell cycle.

(a-c) The CCK8 cell proliferation assay, EdU incorporation assays and transwell migration assay were used to detect cell proliferation.

EBV-miR-BART5-3p directly downregulates human TP53 gene P53 is a widely recognized gene that acts as a tumor suppressor. It has garnered significant interest for its involvement in the progression of different types of cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma. To investigate the relationship between EBV infection and P53 expression in Burkitt lymphoma, we conducted a comparative analysis of P53 expression levels in normal and Burkitt lymphoma tissue samples using the GEO database (GSE65674 and GSE4464). Based on our analysis, we discovered that, in contrast to normal tissues, P53 level were decreased in BL tissues (Figure 3a). Moreover, we used the CCLE database to examine how EBV infection affected P53 expression in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and confirmed that P53 expression was substantially lower in EBV-infected Raji cells than in EBV-uninfected CA46 cells (Figure 3b). To further validate the findings from the microarray data, we performed RT-qPCR to ascertain P53 expression levels in BL cells, eventually yielding outcomes that are in line with the front (Figure 3c). These findings imply that the downregulation of P53 expression in BL cells may be caused by EBV infection. The predicted gene targets of EBV-miR-BART5-3p were first obtained from TargetScan and RNAhybrid to further establish the connection between EBV-miR-BART5-3p with P53. According to biological informatics analysis, the EBV-miR-BART5-3p seed sequence and the 3'-UTR of P53 matched quite well (Figure 3d). Additionally, we used luciferase reporter assays and observed that the BART5-3p mimic markedly lowered the luciferase activity of the 3'-UTR when compared to the control mimic. This finding is consistent with a study conducted by Zheng et al. (Reference: Zheng et al.[35]), which raises the possibility that the BART5-3p mimic specifically targets target sites in the 3' UTR of TP53 mRNA. Next, we examined how BART5-3p affects the levels of P53 mRNA, as well as protein in BL cell lines. As demonstrated by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, higher levels of BART5-3p drastically decreased the level of P53 (Figure 3e, 3f). Based on the aforementioned information, it is highly likely that BART5-3p targets TP53, implying that BART5-3p may be involved in the reduction of P53 levels in Burkitt's lymphoma.

Inhibiting TP53 promotes BL proliferation To ascertain whether P53 downregulation produces a phenotype similar to that attained by BART5-3p, we used P53 inhibitors to downregulate P53 expression in Ramos and CA46 cells. After 48 h, we assessed P53 expression levels using RT-qPCR (Figure 4a). As expected, downregulation of P53 by miR-BART5-3p led to increased cell growth. This led us to hypothesize that maybe P53 controls how cell function. To verify this assumption, we explored the role of P53's activity in modulating the cell cycle and proliferation. Cell growth and migration were measured using CCK-8 proliferation and transwell assays, and the findings indicated that the proportion of proliferating and migrating cells increased in Ramos and CA46 cells treated with the P53 inhibitor compared to those treated with the control inhibitor (Figure 4b, 4c). In addition, in comparison to the control inhibitor, downregulating P53 increased the proportion of cells that participated in the S and G2/M phases and lowered the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase (Figure 4d). The results presented indicate that in Burkitt's lymphoma cells, BART5-3p negatively regulates P53 thus encouraging cell proliferation, migration, and alterations in cell cycle distribution. Figure 4 | Inhibiting TP53 promotes BL proliferation. (a) Expression levels of P53 after application of P53 inhibitor in Ramos and CA46 cells. (b-c) The CCK8 cell proliferation assay and transwell migration assay were used to detect cell proliferation and migration.

Three independent experiments were performed, and data are shown as the means. *, P <0.05; **, P <0.01; ***, P <0.001 compared with the control group. Inhibit the proliferation of BL after knockdown of BART5-3p in Raji cells To understand how innately expressed BART5-3p influences P53 expression in Burkitt's lymphoma cells infected with EBV, we conducted experiments using BART5-3p and P53 inhibitors in Raji cells. First, we assessed the effect of a P53 inhibitor on P53 mRNA levels. After treating Raji cells with the P53 inhibitor, we found that P53 mRNA levels decreased by 5% compared with the control (Figure 5a). We subsequently examined the effect of the BART5-3p inhibitor on P53. In comparison to the control group following inhibitor transfection, we noted a 7-fold higher level of P53 protein levels after transfecting Raji cells using the BART5-3p inhibitor (Figure 5b, 5c). The results of these studies indicate that BART5-3p, which is naturally expressed, effectively reduces P53 expression in Raji cells, elevations of P53 mRNA and P53 protein are caused by BART5-3p inhibition. Overall, these findings further support the notion that BART5-3p has a major impact on controlling the activity of P53 in EBV-infected Burkitt's lymphoma cells. To validate the regulatory significance of BART5-3p on P53 activity in BL growth, as well as to research fundamental biological processes, we conducted experiments using the Raji cell line. First, we performed CCK-8 proliferation and Transwell migration assays to assess the influence of BART5-3p on cell migration. The results indicated that upregulation of P53 by the miR-BART5-3p inhibitor reduced cell migration, whereas knockdown of P53 alone increased cell migration. Interestingly, co-transfection with the P53 inhibitor eliminated the inhibition of Raji cell growth caused by the BART5-3p inhibitor compared to the control inhibitor (Figure 5d-5f). Flow cytometry was used for additional analysis of cell cycle distribution. Compared with the control group, transfection with the BART5-3p inhibitor increased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and weakened the ratios of cells in the G2/M and S phases. In contrast, when the P53 inhibitor was used alone, it had a contrary impact on cell cycle distribution. Notably, when the miR-BART5-3p inhibitor and P53 inhibitor were co-transfected, the inhibitory effect of BART5-3p on the cell cycle was diminished (Figure 5g-h). Additionally, Similar outcomes were observed when cell cycle-related proteins were analyzed using western blotting, and the expression levels of these proteins were in line with the modifications observed in the distribution of the cell cycle. (Figure 5i). Taken together, these results imply that BART5-3p stimulates cell growth and cycle change through the direct downregulation of P53 in Raji cells. The upregulation of P53 by the miR-BART5-3p inhibitor leads to the suppression of cell growth and alterations in cell cycle distribution, while knockdown of P53 reverses these effects.

CONCLUSIONS The miR-BARTs encoded by EBV play a crucial role not only in the capacity of the EBV virus to cause cancer but also in its control over the cell cycle. The BART gene produces 44 full-length miRNAs that are significantly expressed in EBV-associated lymphoma from 22 precursor miRNAs (miR-BART1-22)[36]. In our study, we showed that EBV-positive Raji cells have elevated levels of BART5-3p. To further explore how EBV-encoded genes promote the development of Burkitt lymphoma, we altered BART5-3p levels in BL cells that were linked to EBV. Our findings indicate that BART5-3p considerably enhances proliferation in vitro. Importantly, previous studies have indicated that cells in the S phase are more numerous and those in the G0/G1 phase are fewer when BART5-3p is present[35]. These findings were consistent with our results. Additionally, we determined that TP53 was the target of BART5-3p. leading to upregulation of cyclinD1 proteins. This involvement in regulating the cell cycle of BL cells contributes to cell growth and tumorigenesis. The p53 gene is one of the most well-known tumor suppressors[37]. Zheng et al. reported that BART5-3p has been identified in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma along with gastric cancer cells compared to normal cells, promoting tumor growth. Furthermore, p53 can be degraded by BART5-3p overexpression[35]. Similarly, other studies have highlighted that downregulating BART5-3p can increase P53 expression by targeting it, thus enhancing the radiosensitivity[38] of human EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells [38]. In line with these findings, our research team performed bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays, confirming that BART5-3p may bind to P53's 3'-UTR regions and cause the protein to be reduced. These findings provide further evidence for the close association between the P53 gene and the oncogenic mechanism of EBV. To understand the fundamental processes of BART5-3p in BL proliferation, we employed an integrated strategy that involved process enrichment analysis, literature retrieval, computational biology prediction, and verification of gene regulation in cells. Using this approach, we identified 285 differentially expressed genes between EBV-negative and EBV-positive samples, along with several significant pathways. Interestingly, we found that the cell cycle is a major pathway involved in the oncogenic mechanisms of EBV infection in BL. This suggests that EBV-miR-BART5-3p regulates the cell cycle to promote BL proliferation. Further investigation into the specific genes and molecular events involved in this pathway could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of EBV-associated BL. P53 plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle and interacts with other cell cycle regulators to maintain the normal progression of the cell cycle[39]. P53 and cyclin-CDK complex: P53 can inhibit the activity of the cyclin-CDK complex, thereby preventing cells from entering the S phase[40, 41]. Consistent with these findings, when we added P53 inhibitors to EBV-infected Raji cells, we noticed significantly elevated levels of cyclinD1 protein genes. In order to further verify the effect of BART5-3p on the cell cycle of Burkitt lymphoma through P53, we added BART5-3p inhibitor to Raji cells before and found that the proportion of cells entering the S phase was much lower than that of the control group, and when BART5-3p inhibitor and P53 inhibitor were used together, It was found that P53 inhibitors could partially reverse the cell cycle induced by BART5-3p into S phase. This suggests that BART5-3p may induce the proliferation of Burkitt lymphoma cells by down-regulating P53. In summary, our findings indicate that EBV promotes cell growth in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells through miR-BART5-3p-mediated targeting of P53. Our data also demonstrated that BART5-3p plays a significant role in the cancer cell cycle by regulating P53. These results offer new perspectives on the carcinogenic mechanism of EBV in Burkitt lymphoma.   CLINICALTRIAL -
