Photocatalysis presents a promising pathway for clean energy generation by leveraging solar energy under environmentally benign conditions with minimal pollutant emissions. However, its widespread application is hindered by low catalytic efficiency, stemming from limited light absorption, rapid recombination of photo-excited electrons, and suboptimal charge carrier potential for target reactions. This review discusses advanced strategies to enhance photocatalytic performance by modulating photocatalytic supports and refining co-catalysts. Techniques such as hydrogenation and extrinsic doping of photocatalytic supports are highlighted for their ability to broaden light absorption and prolong electron lifetimes. Additionally, the strategic design of co-catalysts, including the use of nanoclusters and atomically dispersed catalysts, is emphasized for optimizing charge carrier potential and improving atomic utilization efficiency. This review aims to guide researchers in developing high-performance photocatalysts for clean energy applications, including CO2 reduction and plastic waste photoreforming, thereby contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies.

To achieve high catalytic activity of artificial photosystems in carbon dioxide reduction or water reduction/oxidation into renewable energy vectors, the use of sacrificial electron do-nors (SEDs) remains mandatory. Despite significant progress in artificial photocatalysis, a detailed understanding of the influence of the SEDs on the reaction mechanism is still lack-ing. We have explored the roles of triethanolamine as SED in the selective CO2 to formic acid photoreduction promoted by various pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium(III)-based porous materials as model catalysts, including polyoxometalate-doped systems. In the pres-ence of anionic polyoxometalates, agglomeration of protonated triethanolamine close to the catalytically active site favours H2 evolution over CO2 reduction, which can be modulated through the degree of confinement imposed by the pores size. Radical trapping experiments and EPR spectroscopy show that triethanolamine-radicals are crucial for a high activity in CO2 reduction. Triethanolamine-radicals act as electron relays in the efficient two-electron activation of the catalyst, regardless whether a homogeneous or a heterogeneous catalyst is used. In contrast, triethylamine-radicals cause deactivation of the one-electron reduced cata-lyst, thus highlighting the effect of different SED-intermediates and underling the im-portance of an appropriate SED.

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to valuable fuels and chemical feedstock is a sustainable strategy to lower the anthropogenic CO 2 concentration, thereby dynamising the carbon cycle in the environment. CH 3 OH on the other hand is undoubtedly the most desirable C 1 product of CO 2 RR. However, selective electroreduction of CO 2 ‐to‐CH 3 OH is very challenging and only limited catalysts are reported in literature. Pyrolyzing metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) to generate carbon matrix impregnated with metal nanoparticles, heralds exciting electrocatalytic properties. This study unveiled the morphological evolution of a mixed‐ligand Ni‐MOF (Ni‐OBBA‐Bpy) during pyrolysis, to generate Ni nanoparticles anchored 0D porous hollow carbon superstructures (Pyr‐CP‐800 and Pyr‐CP‐600). This unique morphology invokes high specific surface area and surface roughness to the materials, which synergistically facilitates the selective electroreduction of CO 2 ‐to‐CH 3 OH. In comparison to most of the previously reported Ni electrocatalysts that mainly produced CO, Pyr‐CP‐800 selectively yielded CH 3 OH with Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 32.46% at −0.60 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which is highest among other reported Ni‐based electrocatalysts in the literature, to best of our knowledge. Additionally, insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Ni (111) plane to be the active site toward the electrochemical. CO 2 ‐to‐CH 3 OH formation.

Fe-doped TiO2 (Fe/TiO2) film photocatalyst was prepared by sol-gel dip-coating, and pulse arc plasma process. The netlike glass fiber was used as a base material for the photocatalyst since it had a porous structure. The CO2 reduction performance with H2 and H2O into CO over the Fe/TiO2 photocatalyst was investigated. In addition, this study investigated overlapping two Fe/TiO2 coated on netlike glass fiber in order to utilize the light more effectively as well as increase the amount of photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The characterization of prepared Fe/TiO2 film coated on netlike glass fiber was analyzed by SEM, EPMA, TEM, EDX and EELS. Furthermore, the CO2 reduction performance of the Fe/TiO2 film was tested under a Xe lamp with or without ultraviolet (UV) light, respectively. The results show that the CO2 reduction performance peaks under the condition of CO2/H2/H2O=1:1:0.5 in both cases with UV light and without UV light illumination. The highest concentration of CO with the Fe/TiO2 overlapped photocatalyst is 1.2 times of that with the single Fe/TiO2 photocatalyst. On the other hand, results also show the highest molar quantity of CO per weight of photocatalyst for Fe/TiO2 overlapped is almost half of single Fe/TiO2.

The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to optimize urban planning and reduce CO2 emissions. In the context of increasing urbanization and green-house gas emissions, cities are faced with the need to find innovative solutions for sustainable development. AI provides a wide range of tools for data analysis, modeling and prediction, which allows developing and implementing more effective urban management strategies. The main fo-cus is on intelligent transport systems that optimize traffic flows, control traffic lights and predict routes, which leads to reduced congestion and carbon dioxide emissions. It also considers the use of AI for energy management in buildings, the development of "smart" homes and offices that automatically adapt to operating conditions and minimize energy costs.

The utilization of renewable energy for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) represents a significant advancement in green carbon conversion technologies. Single atom catalysts (SACs) featuring a transition metal‐nitride‐carbon (M‐Nx‐C) architecture exhibit catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to CO. However, the impact of the morphology of carbon supports, particularly their pore structure, on the electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR warrants further investigation. In this study, we fabricated a series of Ni‐based SACs supported by porous carbon nanofibers through electrospinning and sacrificial template method. We examined variations in microstructure of these porous carbon nanofiber carriers at different pyrolysis temperatures and elucidated their effects on CO2RR catalytic performance. The catalyst obtained at 1000 °C demonstrated efficient electrocatalysis for converting CO2 to CO due to its large specific surface area, abundant hierarchical pore structure, and high content of Ni‐Nx species resulting from both the sacrificial template method and high‐temperature pyrolysis. A Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% was sustained across potentials ranging from −0.7 V to −1.3 V (vs. RHE), with a peak efficiency reaching 96.1% at −1.0 V (vs. RHE). Kinetic analysis indicated that this sample exhibited the highest reaction kinetics alongside minimal charge transfer resistance.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been proved as a promising pathway for valuable chemical production and sustainable carbon cycling. Various regulatory strategies have been explored to boost CO2RR performance. Among these, metal‐based electrocatalytic CO2RR systems regulated by organic modifiers have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating the complex catalytic processes. Herein, we provide an overview of the recent effective research for regulating the organic modifiers on metal‐based catalyst to enhance CO2RR performance. Two main fundamental mechanisms of enhanced CO2RR with organic modifiers are discussed, including controlling the local microenvironment (local concentration of reactant/intermediate, local pH, local electric field) at the electrode surface and modulating intrinsic catalytic active sites (crystal and electronic structure). Moreover, effective strategies to preserve a stable organic modifier/catalysts interface are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges and prospects faced by organic modifiers regulated metal‐based catalyst in CO2RR are proposed. We hope this review will provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the actual impacts of organic modifiers on the development of efficient CO2RR catalysts with favorable activity, selectivity, and stability.

Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the distinct pathways for gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well‐defined Ag‐Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination, respectively. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) near 100% over a broad potential range in a 0.5 M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl‐Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total FE nearing 100%, delivering high current density under similar conditions. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl‐Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl‐Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential‐limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C‐bound or O‐bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag‐Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.

Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the distinct pathways for gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well-defined Ag-Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination, respectively. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) near 100% over a broad potential range in a 0.5 M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl-Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total FE nearing 100%, delivering high current density under similar conditions. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl-Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl-Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential-limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C-bound or O-bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag-Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.

The increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can lead to climate change and adversely affect human health. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to capture CO2 and convert it into a more valuable substance, such as methanol. In this study, we established a tandem system involving dye-sensitized solar cells and photoelectrochemical (DSSC-PEC), which included the PEC zone using CuO/dark TiO2 nanotube array (CuO/dTNA) as the dark cathode where CO2 reduction takes place, and Co-Pi/blue TiO2 nanotube array (Co-Pi/bTNA) as the counter photoanode. For the DSSC zone, N719/TNA was used as the photoanode, I-/I3- electrolyte, and Pt/FTO as the cathode. The tandem system was constructed by connecting the PEC cathode to the DSSC photoanode and the PEC photoanode to the DSSC cathode using silver wire. Under solely visible light induction and water containing sodium bicarbonate electrolyte saturated with CO2, the proposed devise produced methanol at 1.292 μmol/hour.

Abstract The growth rate of transportation sector’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is rigid, making it difficult to reduce emissions, especially for developing countries. The existing literature has not yet fully investigated the CO2 emissions reduction effect of transportation structural adjustment from the perspective of improving productivity, which is defined by total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) in this study. To close this knowledge gap, we first evaluated the TFEE of the transportation sector as a whole and its sub-sectors in 30 provinces in China from 2013 to 2021 based on the parallel data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and then estimated the energy conservation and emissions reduction potentials brought about by the optimization of the transportation structure based on the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model. The main results show: (1) TFEEs vary greatly across sub-sectors and provinces, with provinces performing differently across sub-sectors. (2) Compared with the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, the structure enhancement (SE) scenario of structural adjustment can cumulatively reduce CO2 emissions by 289.20 Mt by 2030. (3) In the SE scenario, the energy demand will peak in 2026 and the CO2 emissions will peak at 1509.55 MT in 2027. These results indicate that the CO2 reduction from the transportation restructuring (structural effect) can exceed the increase in CO2 emissions following an increase in transportation activity (scale effect) and eventually bring down the total CO2 emissions for the transportation sector, despite the TFEE rankings of the subsector varying across regions. Therefore, policies that value regions with large volumes, a high share of road transport, and well-established infrastructure, can achieve greater potential to reduce carbon emissions.

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) systems are an integral part of sustainable pathways limiting global warming to less than 2.0 °C. When the sole purpose of CDR is capturing and storing atmospheric CO2, carbon registries offer detailed procedures to calculate the carbon removal credits. However, the registries do not address how to distribute CO2 flows when CDR provides additional services. Standardized, transparent rules for distributing CO2 flows among CDR services are required for the formation of efficient private and public carbon markets. The lack of such rules could result in double counting if those reductions are allocated to more than one service, decreasing the trustworthiness of carbon removal credits or deterring the delivery of an additional low-carbon service, thus limiting the economic viability and deployment of CDR. We examine allocation rules in carbon registries and carbon accounting guidelines, including their life cycle assessment (LCA) principles. We evaluate physical (mass-based) and non-physical (economic) allocation methods using a generic CDR system and find both to be unworkable. We then develop a mass balance (MB) approach which can reliably allocate captured and stored carbon (CSC) between carbon removal credits and other services based on the value CO2 removal in those markets. This practical approach to allocation can be used in a transparent way to provide flexibility that would allow CDR services to capture the value of the multiple services they provide and, through this, promote the deployment of these sustainable alternatives.

This work presents an experimental study of the performance and emissions of an internal combustion engine operating in the Otto cycle with a high volumetric compression ratio (17:1). The engine was initially fueled with the standard ethanol used in Brazil, with 7% distilled water (E93W07); we then studied the effects of using different ethanol-in-water mixtures, or ‘wet ethanol’, with 17%, 27%, 37%, and 47% distilled water concentrations. The tests were carried out with power loads of 5.0–25.0 kW at 5.0 kW intervals and with power loads of 27.5–35.0 kW at 2.5 kW intervals, whether by adding up the loads or by taking them away. The ignition timing was changed to evaluate each load imposed on the engine to avoid knocking. Specific fuel consumption (SFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and total hydrocarbon content (THC), as well as the internal pressure in the cylinder and the heat release rate, were measured, and the results are compared. The results show a reduction in CO and NOx and an increase in THC emissions. However, there were no significant changes in CO2 emissions when the distilled water percentage in ethanol increased. Regarding the brake thermal efficiency, it was observed that it remained approximately constant for all blends, with the same load being applied to the engine shaft, reaching a maximum value of 35%. The results obtained confirm the technical feasibility of operating an internal combustion engine in the Otto cycle with a high volumetric compression ratio using ethanol with up to 47% distilled water without significant loss of performance.

The ocean has absorbed ~one third of the excess atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) released since the Industrial Revolution. When the ocean absorbs excess CO2, a series of chemical reactions occur that result in a reduction in seawater pH, a process called ocean acidification. The excess atmospheric CO2 is also resulting in warmer seawater temperatures. These stressors pose a threat to marine organisms, especially during earlier life stages (i.e., larvae). The larvae of species like the Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) are free swimming, allowing a population to disperse and recruit into new habitats. After release, stone crab larvae undergo vertical swimming excursions in response to abiotic stimuli (gravity, light, pressure) allowing them to control their depth. Typically, newly hatched larvae respond to abiotic cues that would promote a shallower depth distribution, where surface currents can transport them offshore to complete development. As larvae develop offshore, they become less sensitive to certain abiotic stimuli, which promotes a deeper depth distribution that may expose them to variable current speeds, thus influencing the direction of advection (horizontal movement). Environmental stressors like ocean acidification and elevated seawater temperatures may also impact the larvae’s natural response to these abiotic stimuli throughout ontogeny (development). Changes in their natural swimming behavior due to climate stressors could, therefore, influence the transport and dispersal of the species. This guided-inquiry lesson challenges introductory marine biology and oceanography students to determine how future ocean pH and temperature projections could impact the swimming behavior of Florida stone crab larvae.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant and accelerated developments in ventilation practises, where the need to ventilate buildings has been put centre stage. Longer-term ventilation approaches are now more likely to utilise hybrid ventilation strategies to address the challenge of ensuring resilient indoor thermal environments that are carbon neutral while also minimising the risk of long-range airborne infectious spread of viral pathogens. In the short term, there are many existing buildings which may not undergo retrofit for some time, and consequently, risk mitigation strategies have been implemented in these buildings by utilising existing systems. This paper will present an indoor environmental quality evaluation of ten university lecture rooms both before, during and after changes in ventilation management behaviour and systems that were accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate a mean reduction in internal carbon dioxide levels of between 46% and 67% when pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 datasets are compared and between 11% and 62% when pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 datasets are compared. Changes in behaviour and systems have reduced the time spent above thresholds conducive to virus growth by between 8% and 54%, depending on the lecture room. Despite this, a “rebound” can be observed in many rooms, with CO2 levels appearing to be trending toward pre-pandemic levels. This work indicates the effect of behavioural and system changes on ventilation and the potential risk for virus spread. The results indicate a need to retrofit existing lecture rooms with more advanced natural or mechanical systems to ensure consistent indoor environmental quality.

The issue of global climate change is highly critical, and the dual-carbon targets are extremely urgent. The home appliance industry, as a significant component of the manufacturing sector, establishing a green and standardized industrial system is an essential measure to mitigate the impact of global warming. The amount of typical home appliance waste is increasing day by day, and the accounting and analysis of carbon dioxide emissions in the waste disposal process serve as crucial references for establishing a low-carbon industry. This paper employs the life cycle assessment method, targeting the waste disposal process of typical home appliances. A refrigerator is selected as the research object to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions in the three stages of recovery, disassembly, and reuse in the waste disposal process. A comparative analysis is conducted on the carbon dioxide emissions of producing 1 kg of recycled materials and primary materials. The most effective carbon reduction measures for different home appliances are evaluated to provide suggestions and references for promoting the low-carbon and green development of the industry. The final conclusions are as follows: (1) The results of the life cycle assessment indicate that there are significant differences in carbon emissions in different processing stages. Among them, the carbon emissions in the iron recovery stage are the highest, accounting for 87% of the total emissions, while the carbon emissions in the copper recovery stage are the lowest, accounting for only 0.6% of the total emissions. (2) During the process of producing 1 kg of recycled materials, the carbon dioxide emissions in the iron recycling stage are the highest. Compared with the production of 1 kg of primary materials, the carbon dioxide emissions in the primary stages of aluminum, copper, iron, and plastic are all higher than those in the recycling stages.

The rise in global temperatures, driven by carbon dioxide emissions, has spurred the construction industry to seek carbon reduction strategies. This study evaluates the environmental benefits of using wood materials in construction by redesigning an existing reinforced concrete (RC) residential building in New Taipei City, Taiwan. Four structural combinations were developed, replacing concrete with timber and steel. Numerical simulations confirmed the feasibility of these systems, and comparisons of embodied carbon, costs, and construction periods were conducted. The proposed hybrid models, which extensively replace concrete with timber and steel for the core, reduced initial embodied carbon by 25.6% compared to the original RC building, though costs increased by 3.9 times. These findings underscore the potential of hybrid timber systems as a sustainable alternative in construction, offering significant carbon reduction benefits for Taiwan while aligning with environmental goals.

Abstract This study aims to investigate the challenges and dilemmas that enterprises face in pursuing energy conservation and carbon reduction. It emphasizes that while promoting carbon reduction not only helps protect the environment and enhances corporate image, but also leads to long-term operational cost savings, numerous hurdles still exist in practice. These challenges include technical constraints, high investment costs, and uncertainties surrounding policies and regulations. Current literature largely focuses on the impact of macro policies on corporate carbon reduction, often neglecting a micro-level analysis of firms' motivations and practices, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises and non-high-emission industries. This study systematically identifies the factors influencing corporate energy conservation and carbon reduction through comprehensive text and policy analysis. The findings suggest that policy formulation should take into account the varying sizes of enterprises, increase oversight of larger companies, offer targeted support for SMEs, and work to bridge the capacity gap among businesses. As countries actively implement emissions reduction policies, companies are becoming more aware of and responsive to the need for lowering carbon emissions; however, sustained efforts are essential to achieve long-term objectives. The study provides several suggestions for governments to develop differentiated policy measures, enhance corporate education and training initiatives, promote the adoption of new technologies, improve regulatory incentive mechanisms, and establish industry-specific emissions reduction roadmaps. At the enterprise level, it is crucial to integrate carbon reduction into long-term strategies and align it with the industry supply chain. Achieving the goal of net-zero carbon emissions will necessitate collaborative efforts from governments, businesses, and society as a whole. JEL classification numbers: H25, I115, J48.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) can effectively activate inert carbon dioxide molecules into more helpful fuels and chemicals for human life, which is considered to be one of the most potential ways to achieve the goal of carbon neutralization in the future. So far, using electrocatalytic technology to reduce CO 2 molecules into single-carbon products is very mature, but it is still a great challenge to obtain multicarbon products with more practical values. For this reason, it is urgent to design and synthesize electrocatalysts with ultrahigh selectivity, stability, and excellent activity. Crystalline porous materials (such as metal–organic framework (MOF), covalent organic framework (COF), and their corresponding derived porous materials) provide great opportunities for the activation and transformation of CO 2 because of their large specific surface area, high porosity, controllable structure and morphology, and modified framework, making them a promising candidate material for CO 2 RR. This chapter summarizes in detail the latest research progress on porous materials as typical functional porous framework catalysts in the field of CO 2 RR, providing new horizons and ideas for future exploration in this important field.    

    

## Testing Exhaust Emissions of Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles in Poland

The article addresses the usage patterns of plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) under Polish conditions. The conventional approach to operating such vehicles assumes that they are used with a fully charged battery at the start. However, the economic circumstances of Polish users often do not allow for daily charging of vehicles from the domestic power grid. As a result, these vehicles are used not only in a mode powered solely by the internal combustion engine but also in a mode where the internal combustion engine is primarily utilized to charge the battery. An analysis was conducted on various ways of operating plug-in vehicles, evaluating not only harmful emissions but also fuel consumption (for battery states of charge: SOC = 100%, SOC = 50%, SOC = 0%, and SOC = 0 → 100%—forced charging mode). The study focused on the most characteristic vehicle segment in Poland, SUVs, and employed a methodology for determining exhaust emissions under real-world driving conditions. Results indicate that forced charging of such a vehicle’s battery leads to over a 25-fold increase in carbon dioxide emissions (fuel consumption) in urban areas compared to operating the vehicle with a fully charged battery (CO—25× increase, NOx—12× increase, PN—11× increase). Operating a plug-in SUV without charging it from the power grid results in a 13-fold increase in fuel consumption compared to using the vehicle with a fully charged battery (CO—10× increase, NOx—6× increase, PN—4× increase). The emission results were used to evaluate Poland’s charging infrastructure in the context of PHEV usage. The current state of the infrastructure and its development plans for 2030 and 2040 were analyzed. It was found that significant reductions in fuel consumption (by approximately 30%) and CO2 emissions are achievable by 2040. Emissions of CO, NOx, and PN are expected to decrease by about 10%, primarily due to the internal combustion engine operating at high load conditions in non-urban or highway scenarios.

Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) utilization technology is of great significance for achieving carbon neutrality, in which the catalytic materials play crucial roles, and among them, single‐atom alloys (SAAs) are of particular interests. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning are employed to assess the effectiveness of Cu‐, Ag‐, and Ni‐host SAAs as catalysts for electrochemical CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH. The Gibbs free energies of 477 elementary reactions across 35 SAAs involved in CO 2 reduction are calculated, and by utilizing this dataset, a trained gradient boosting regression model is established with an excellent accuracy. Subsequently, the properties of 46 unknown SAAs are predicted, including their pathways, products, potential‐determining steps (PDS), and corresponding Gibbs free energies of the PDS ( G PDS ). Three promising candidates, ZnCu, AuAg and MoNi, stand out due to their lowest G PDS among Cu‐, Ag‐ and Ni‐ hosted SAAs, respectively.

ABSTRACT Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, accounting for nearly 70% of global freshwater consumption, and it also uses about 30% of the world's energy. This creates an increasing challenge for the efficient use of water and energy resources while adequately meeting food demand. Therefore, understanding the interrelations between food, energy, and water resources is crucial. In this study, a multi-objective linear programming model was employed to identify alternative scenarios for optimal cropping areas that minimize water use in agriculture and maximize agricultural income. Different weight coefficients were assigned to these objective functions to generate various cropping scenarios. Once the optimal cropping patterns for each scenario were determined, parameters such as water use, energy requirements, agricultural revenue, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on the food-energy-water nexus. The results for each alternative crop pattern scenario were then analyzed. The results indicate that prioritizing the objective of minimizing water use leads to an average reduction of 3.35% in water use, 1.18% in energy demand, and 0.26% in carbon dioxide emissions, while agricultural income increases by an average of 1% compared to the base scenario. Conversely, when maximizing agricultural income is prioritized, there is an average increase of 2.05% in agricultural income.

Abstract China has over 2,500 national and provincial industrial parks, stimulating the economics growth, meanwhile being the primary sources of carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants. Assessing the mechanisms and impacts of the policies of pilot programs of green industrial parks on urban carbon emissions offers critical insights into the efficacy and application of green and low‐carbon development. This study utilizes a staggered difference‐in‐differences model to examine the impact of green industrial park pilot policies. The results demonstrate that green industrial parks have effectively reduced carbon emissions of the studied counties in terms of total and intensity. The economic scales and the administrative levels of any given city significantly influence the implementation effect of green industrial park policy. In applying the green industrial park policy, reducing the carbon emissions is more pronounced in cities with larger economic scales and higher administrative levels. Environmental regulation policies and green industrial park pilot policies exhibit a certain degree of substitution effect. The green industrial parks drive urban carbon emission reduction through three main channels: enhancing green technologies, optimizing industrial structures, and elevating economic agglomeration levels. Overall, this study provides a new perspective, a methodological reference, and empirical evidence for promoting green and low‐carbon development for industrial parks in the different regions and developing countries.

Abstract Erlenmeyer shake flasks are widely used during the first steps of bioprocess development. Despite their broad application in academia and industry, shake flasks usually lack standardized and user‐friendly online monitoring techniques. In this work, the pH and Respiratory Activity MOnitoring System (pH‐RAMOS) for the non‐invasive online measurement of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR), carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR), and pH in up to eight parallel shake flasks under sterile conditions is presented. The OTR and CTR are quasi‐continuously measured in the headspace of the shake flasks using dedicated oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors, enabling precise respiratory quotient (RQ) evaluation. Self‐adhesive pH sensor spots are used for the high‐frequent real‐time pH monitoring of the culture. These prototype pH sensor spots stand out due to their simple sterilizability and subsequent one‐point calibration in the cultivation medium. The long‐term stability of the pH sensor spots was assessed in a 28‐day long abiotic experiment. The novel pH‐RAMOS was validated with different eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Ogataea polymorpha , Ustilago trichophora , and Vibrio natriegens . The combination of online OTR, CTR, RQ, and pH signals allowed for identifying various metabolic phenomena, such as oxygen limitations, substrate limitations, diauxies, and the production or consumption of specific compounds, based on their degree of reduction or change of pH. The high‐frequent and sensitive pH‐monitoring was particularly advantageous for registering subtle and transient metabolic phenomena.

CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is one of the common and effective ways for carbon capture, utilization and storage(CCUS) in China. The injection of CO2 into petroleum reservoirs may influence subsurface environments and further affect microorganisms in oil reservoirs. However, the current knowledge about the impact of CO2 flooding operation on microbial communities and their metabolic functions in oil reservoirs is still limited. In this study, the compositions and metabolic potential of microbial communities in production water from CO2-and water-flooded oil reservoirs in Jilin oilfield were investigated by using a metagenomic approach. Comparative analyses indicated that the microbial community compositions in CO2-flooded oil reservoir samples (GQ43 and GH46) were significantly different from those in water-flooded ones (WQ21 and WH71), with lower microbial diversity. The difference analysis (p<0.05) showed that Pseudomonas, Stutzerimonas, Marinobacterium,Pseudomonadaceae, Methanosarcina and Archaeoglobus were dominant in the former, while Azonexus, Sulfurospirillum, Candidatus Woesearchaeota, Candidatus Methanofastidiosa and Nanoarchaeota predominated in the latter. According to the high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) obtained, some members identified in the CO2-flooded oil reservoir samples might be involved in aerobic alkane biodegradation (Stutzerimonas and Hyphomonas), activated hydrocarbon utilization (Archaeoglobus and Magnetospirillum), fatty acid degradation (Stutzerimonas and Halomonas), fermentative metabolism (Stutzerimonas, Acidaminobacter, Fusibacter, Magnetospirillum, Shewanella, Halodesulfovibrio, Pseudodesulfovibrio and Halomonas), carbon fixation (Methanosarcina and Halodesulfovibrio)and syntrophic methanogenesis (Methanosarcina), simultaneously accompanied by dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate reduction and denitrification. Whereas, a series of MAGs recovered from the water-flooded oil reservoir samples might be responsible for fumarate addition of aromatic hydrocarbons, activated hydrocarbon utilization, acetogenesis, reductive citrate cycle, dissimilatory nitrate reduction and sulfur metabolism (dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation). These results contribute a broad and deep understanding of microbial communities and their roles in petroleum reservoirs especially affected by CO2 flooding operation, and provide the basic biological information for CCUS.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases cause the atmosphere to get warmer. The ocean absorbs most of the heat and much of the CO2. This raises the temperature of the water, which can cause glaciers and ice sheets to melt, sea level to rise, coral reefs to bleach, fish to migrate to colder waters, and sea turtle sex ratio become skewed toward females. The CO2 added to the water causes its pH to get lower, or more acidic, which has its own negative effects on marine biota, especially shell formation in mollusks. These changes can have drastic economic effects as well as environmental ones. Reductions in fossil fuel use are essential to combat this global problem.

High visitor numbers in protected areas can create traffic problems that impact on the environmental protection. In Taijiang National Park, a tour bus project 'Taijiang Fun Tour' was introduced to mitigate various environmental problems caused by private cars. This study evaluates the project's environmental benefits, and those of the various bus routes in the park, in reducing CO2 emissions. The Mangrove route only achieved a CO2 reduction in 2023, likely due to post-COVID-19 tourism recovery. In contrast, the Black-faced Spoonbill route consistently showed reductions in CO2 emissions, attributed to higher per trip passenger numbers replacing more private cars, better road conditions, and longer distances between attractions, that enabled higher bus speeds and lower CO2 emissions per unit time. While it is unsurprising that CO2 reduction is significantly influenced by passenger numbers and bus speeds, the results of this study could be used by TJNP to enhance the benefits from bus use. Starting in 2024, TJNP will optimise routes and implement additional measures to encourage low-carbon transportation.

Abstract Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology is one of the most promising methods for converting solar energy into valuable fuels and chemicals. Silicon (Si), a narrow band gap semiconductor with high carrier mobility, serves as a competitive material for photoelectrodes. This review outlines the research progress of Si‐based photoanodes and photocathodes in diverse economically beneficial PEC redox reactions, extending beyond water splitting to include alcohol oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction, ammonia synthesis, organic degradation, and more. To address the key barriers to achieving efficient PEC conversion – such as slow charge carrier dynamics, sluggish reaction kinetics, and the instability of Si‐based photoelectrodes – the mechanisms and implementation methods for fabricating efficient and stable Si‐based photoelectrodes are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the challenges faced in advancing the commercialization of Si‐based PEC solar energy conversion processes are explored.

Introduction The carbon footprint of severe asthma (SA) and the impact of biologic therapy in this population is unknown. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study in adults with SA, using data from the Northern Ireland Regional Severe Asthma Service (September 2015-November 2021). We calculated annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs; carbon dioxide equivalent) for asthma-related medications and healthcare resource utilisation, compared patient characteristics by GHG-quartile, calculated GHG change post-biologic initiation and explored the relationship between GHG change and clinical response. Results Among 303 patients with SA, mean GHGs was 474 kg ( sd :431), largely driven by SABA-use (50.7%) and ED/hospitalizations (21.0%). Those with highest-quartile GHGs were more likely to have uncontrolled disease (ACQ 3.5 versus 2.5; p<0.001), be more deprived (46.1% versus 25.0%, p=0.029) and have depression/anxiety (35.5% versus 14.7%, p=0.002) versus those with lowest-quartile GHGs. Among patients who received a biologic (n=213), modest GHG reductions (−28.0 kg [ sd :286], p=0.15) were observed, largely driven by reduction in ED/hospitalization-related GHGs (−59.3 [ sd :224], p<0.001). SABA-related GHG emissions were relatively unchanged (−6.1 kg [ sd :138]), p=0.518). Total GHGs were 72.4 kg ( sd :352, p=0.044) lower than baseline 4-years post-biologic-initiation. Although there was substantial clinical improvement post-biologic-initiation, this was not associated with GHG reductions. Conclusions SA is associated with substantial GHGs, primarily driven by SABA use and emergency care utilisation. Although GHG emissions were lower post-biologic, largely due to a reduction in emergency care, the changes in GHGs were modest and SABA-use was relatively unchanged. An improved understanding of the factors driving elevated GHGs is required.

Biochemical networks use reaction cascades to selectively reduce CO2 using energy from sunlight, but can similar selectivity be achieved by applying a cascade approach to an engineered system? Here, we report the design and implementation of a two-step photoelectrochemical (PEC) cascade to a liquid solar fuel: reduction of CO2 to CO and subsequent reduction of CO to methanol. The potentials required to perform the reductions were generated using custom-made III-V-based three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNT) catalyzed both reactions. Multiphysics simulations of electrolyte flow and non-illuminated electrochemical measurements were used to narrow the operating parameters for the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes. The champion integrated photocathode produced methanol with 3.8 ± 0.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE), with tested photocathodes having 0.7-3.8% methanol FE. Products were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The current output of the tested photocathodes was highly stable, and methanol production continued over multiple experiments. The low methanol yield is attributed to insufficient CO flux to, and CO2 depletion at, the methanol-producing subcell when both contacts are active, which is supported by the observation that a control photoelectrode slightly outperformed the methanol production of the 3TT device. Methanol production ceased when the 3TT subcell driving CO reduction was deactivated, supporting the assignment of a cascade mechanism. The major factors resulting in low methanol FE by the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes are insufficient CO2 depletion at the methanol-producing contact and uncertainty in operating potential selection using the 3TT design. Although the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathode is not yet highly selective, this work develops the basic science principles underlying the PEC cascade, demonstrates the co-design of a 3TT-based photoelectrode to produce carbon-based fuels, and finally discusses routes for improving product yields with this concept, including CO2 supply optimization and alternative photoelectrode and catalyst materials.

Introduction. Additive manufacturing is a technology that enables three-dimensional (3D) components to be printed layer by layer according to digital models. Completely different from traditional manufacturing methods such as casting, forging, and machining, additive manufacturing is a near net shape manufacturing process that can greatly enhance design freedom and reduce manufacturing runtime. The material processing challenges in Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) are related to achieving performance metrics related to geometric, physical, and material properties. Tight tolerances and stringent surface integrity requirements cannot be achieved by utilizing stand-alone AM technologies. Therefore, WAAM parts typically require some post-processing to meet requirements related to surface finish, dimensional tolerances and mechanical properties. It is therefore not surprising that the integration of AM with post-processing technologies into single and multi-setup machining solutions, commonly referred to as hybrid AM, has become a very attractive proposition for industry. The purpose of the work is to evaluate the quality and mechanical properties of the resulting metal layers of mild steel by WAAM method using additional mechanical and ultrasonic processing. Research Methods. To conduct the experiments, a set of welding equipment was used — a single-phase inverter device KEMPPI Kempomat 1701, designed for welding with wire in shielding gases. A mixture of argon and carbon dioxide (80 % argon and 20 % CO2) was used as a shielding gas. SV-08G2S (0.8 C-2 Mg-Si) wire was used as the surfacing material. A plate made of steel St3 with overall dimensions 150×100×5 mm was used as a base for surfacing. The surface of the plate before surfacing was thoroughly cleaned from the layer of oxides, oil, rust and other contaminants. For this purpose mechanical cleaning of the surface was used with BOSCH abrasive wheel with a diameter of 125 mm diameter and a grit size of 120. Before surfacing the surface of the product was degreased with white spirit. The gas flow rate was set at 8 dm3/min. To select the optimal wire feed rate and volt-ampere characteristic, surfacing was performed at each adjustment step of wire feed rate, and voltage. Mechanical statistical tensile tests, chemical composition analysis and metallographic studies were also performed. Results and Discussion. Gas porosity is a typical defect that occurs during the WAAM process and should be eliminated because it adversely affects the mechanical properties. Initially, gas porosity leads to a reduction in the mechanical strength of the part due to damage from microcrack formation. In addition, it often causes the surfaced layer to have worse fatigue properties due to the spatial distribution of different shape and size structures. In our experiments we found that a wire feed speed range of 5–6 m/min is optimal. Increasing the flow rate of shielding gas in the range of 8–14 l/min allows reducing porosity in the surfaced metal to almost zero. The mechanical properties of the surfaced beads show that the average value of yield strength after machining is higher than that of unprocessed specimens. The data obtained from these experiments are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The presented results can be used in real WAAM technological processes.

As global climate change becomes increasingly severe, industrial CO2 emissions have received increasing attention, but the impact factors and driving mechanisms of industrial CO2 emission intensity remain unclear. Based on panel data from 2010 to 2021 in Shandong Province, a key economic region in eastern China, the industrial CO2 emission intensity under China’s dual carbon target was analyzed using multivariate ordination methods. The results showed that (1) total CO2 emissions from industry are increasing annually, with an average growth rate of 3.74%, and electricity, coal, and coke are the primary sources of CO2 emissions. (2) Total CO2 emissions originated primarily from the heavy manufacturing, energy production, and high energy intensity industry categories, and the CO2 emission intensity of different types of energy increased by 21.24% from 2010 to 2021. (3) CO2 emission intensity is significantly positively correlated with the proportion of high energy intensive industry, energy consumption intensity, and investment intensity and significantly negatively correlated with gross industrial output. In addition, the effects of different types of energy on industrial CO2 emission intensity varied, and coal, coke, electricity, and diesel oil were significantly positively correlated with CO2 emission intensity. Therefore, to reduce the CO2 emission intensity of the industrial sector in the future and to achieve China’s dual carbon target, it is necessary to adjust and optimize the industrial and energy structure, strengthen technological progress and innovation, improve energy utilization efficiency, improve and implement relevant policies for industrial carbon reduction, and then ensure the sustainable development of the economy, society, and environment.

ABSTRACT For ensuring the economic feasibility of the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), which can be used to reduce the catalyst load and increase the catalytic activity of CO 2 RR by using carrier materials. Here, we report the systematic alteration of metal chloride on bipyridine groups in MOF‐253(Al) using modified metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors and the introduction of Ag nanoparticles to prepare catalysts Ag@M‐N/Al‐O (M = Co, Ni, Zn, Cu). EDS spectra showed the uniform dispersion of Ag nanoparticles. In addition, the chemical structure of the catalyst was analyzed by XPS and PXRD, which proved the existence of M‐N and Al‐O bonds. The interaction with Ag nanoparticles leads to electron density reconstruction, and the stable *COOH intermediates with electron delocalization enhanced by polymetallic electron configuration modulation are conducive to CO production. The results show that Ag@Co‐N/Al‐O can achieve 85.6% FE for CO and has good stability within 12 h. This work provides a new idea for CO 2 RR material design using MOFs as a precursor catalyst.

The present work aimed to investigate the effect of increasing CO2 concentration on the growth, productivity, grain quality, and biochemical changes in quinoa and amaranth plants. An experiment was conducted in open chambers (OTCs) to evaluate the responses of these species to different levels of CO2 {a[CO2] = 400 ± 50 μmol mol−1 CO2 for ambient CO2 concentration, e[CO2] = 700 ± 50 μmol mol−1 CO2 for the elevated CO2 concentration}. Growth parameters and photosynthetic pigments reflected changes in gas exchange, saccharolytic enzymes, and carbohydrate metabolism when plants were grown under e[CO2]. Furthermore, both species maintained most of the parameters related to gas exchange, demonstrating that the antioxidant system was efficient in supporting the primary metabolism of plants under e[CO2] conditions. Both species were taller and had longer roots and a greater dry weight of roots and shoots when under e[CO2]. On the other hand, the panicle was shorter under the same situation, indicating that the plants invested energy, nutrients, and all mechanisms in their growth to mitigate stress in expense of yield. This led to a reduction on panicle size and, ultimately, reducing quinoa grain yield. Although e[CO2] altered the plant’s metabolic parameters for amaranth, the plants managed to maintain their development without affecting grain yield. Protein levels in grains were reduced in both species under e[CO2] in the average of two harvests. Therefore, for amaranth, the increase in CO2 mainly contributes to lowering the protein content of the grains. As for quinoa, its yield performance is also affected, in addition to its protein content. These findings provide new insights into how plants C3 (amaranth) and C4 (quinoa) respond to e[CO2], significantly increasing photosynthesis and its growth but ultimately reducing yield for quinoa and protein content in both species. This result ultimately underscore the critical need to breed plants that can adapt to e[CO2] as means to mitigate its negative effects and to ensure sustainable and nutritious crop production in future environmental conditions.

Background and Objectives: In coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on pump, achieving optimal visualization is critical for surgical precision and safety. The use of blowers to clear the CABG anastomosis poses risks, including the formation of micro-embolic gas bubbles, which can be insidious and increase the risk of cerebral or myocardial complications. This retrospective study compares the effectiveness of the use of irrigation mist and CO2 versus a direct CO2 blower without irrigation in terms of visualization, postoperative fibrillation, and micro-embolic gas activity. Materials and Methods: The study involved 40 patients who underwent on-pump CABG, with 20 patients assigned to the irrigation mist and CO2 group (ClearView™) and 20 to the direct CO2 blower group. Primary outcomes included the quality of intraoperative visualization, the incidence of fibrillation at aortic de-clamping, and the presence of micro-embolic gas activity detected via transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the cardiac chambers. Results: Patients in the irrigation mist and CO2 group experienced superior visualization and reduced tissue desiccation. Fibrillation at the time of aortic de-clamping occurred in two patients (10%) using the irrigation mist and CO2, compared to eight patients (40%) using the direct CO2 blower. Additionally, TEE monitoring revealed lower levels of micro-embolic gas activity in the irrigation mist and CO2 group, indicating a potential reduction in gas embolization risk. Conclusions: The irrigation mist and CO2 system not only provides enhanced visualization during CABG but also significantly reduces the incidence of fibrillation during aortic de-clamping and micro-embolic gas activity. These findings suggest improved patient safety and outcomes, highlighting the irrigation mist and CO2 system as a potentially safer alternative to direct CO2 blowing in the context of myocardial revascularization.

The Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis process is projected to have a significant impact in the near future due to its potential for synthesizing sustainable fuels from biomass, carbon dioxide and organic wastes. In this catalytic process, catalyst activation plays a major role in the overall performance of Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis. Catalyst activation temperatures are considerably higher than the typical operating conditions of industrial reactors. Consequently, ex situ activation is often required for industrial Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis processes. This study evaluated the influence of different activation approaches (in situ, ex situ, passivation and low-temperature activation). Catalytic experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 230 °C and 20 bar·g using a reference supported Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Experimental results demonstrate that catalysts can be effectively reduced ex situ. This work reveals that re-activation of the catalyst after ex situ reduction is unnecessary, as the reaction conditions themselves re-reduce any superficial oxides formed, owing to the reducing nature of the reactant mixture. This approach could simplify reactor design by enabling temperature requirements to match operating conditions (e.g., 230 °C), thereby reducing both investment and operational costs and eliminating additional catalyst preparation steps.

The reliability of segmentation of x-ray computed tomography (CT) images based on user-selected thresholds is important for analyzing supercritical CO2 (ScCO2)-water-induced microstructural damage in coal. In this study, a novel approach is introduced by integrating the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method with CT to analyze the evolution of microstructural damage in coal treated by ScCO2-water. The factors influencing GLCM calculation are also examined. GLCM heat maps and statistics were employed to visualize and quantitatively analyze the evolution of microstructural damage. The results show that the application of image grayscale registration and noise reduction to GLCM statistics did not produce directional bias, with noise reduction having a more significant impact. The pixel pairings depicted in GLCM heat maps provide insights into the spatial distribution of pore-fracture (in the low-density quadrant) and mineral components (in the high-density quadrant) within CT images, elucidating the evolution of micro-damage in coal samples. After the ScCO2-water treatment, a conspicuous rise in pixel pair counts within the low-density quadrant can be observed, accompanied by significant dissolution of the highest-density minerals, leading to a maximal reduction in pixel values within the high-density quadrant. Moreover, GLCM statistics show that the maximum damage location after ScCO2-water treatment does not completely match the initial coal. An accurate description of the evolution of GLCM statistics in the structural damage behavior induced by CO2 injection into deep coal-rock reservoirs is crucial, suggesting that these GLCM statistics have the potential to predict structural damage and reservoir instability during the geological sequestration of CO2.

This paper presents a comprehensive holistic methodology implemented for sustainable lighting systems in educational institutions. The proposed methodology is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), and it follows international standards. The six-step process includes viability analysis, project design simulation using DIALux 4.13 software, the installation of LED lighting systems, and the redesign of some electrical circuits, followed by an analysis of return on investment and the monitorization of CO2 and energy consumption. The proposed methodology results in significant return on investment (ROI), primarily achieved through energy savings and reduced maintenance costs. The implementation of LED tubes, combined with occupancy and natural light sensors, leads to a 66% reduction in energy consumption and a reduction of 15.63 tons (metric tons) of CO2 annually, translating into a quick payback period of approximately 2.36 years. Additionally, the system includes Long-Term Monitoring, which ensures that energy consumption and lighting levels are continuously tracked.

Photochemical transformation represents an attractive pathway for the conversion of earth-abundant resources, such as H2O, CO2, O2, and N2, into valuable chemicals by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Recently, two-dimensional conjugated metal-organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) have emerged as the focal points in the field of photo-to-chemical conversion due to their advantages in light harvesting, electrical conductivity, mass transport, tunable electronic and porous structures, as well as abundant active sites. In this review, we highlight various physical and chemical features of 2D c-MOFs that can contribute to enhanced photo-induced exciton generation, charge transport, proton migration and redox catalysis. Then, the existing strategies to integrate suitable light absorbers and/or co-catalysts onto 2D c-MOFs for photochemical transformations (with a particular focus on H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and O2 reduction) have been discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of using 2D c-MOFs in other photochemical applications (e.g., N2 fixation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) are assessed.

Atomically precise gold nanoclusters have shown great promise as model elctrocatalysts in pivotal electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Although the influence of ligands on the electronic properties of these nanoclusters are well acknowledged, the ligand effects on their electrocatalytic performances have been rarely explored. Herein, using [Au25(SR)18]- nanocluster as the prototype model, we demonstrated the importance of ligand hydrophilicity versus hydrophobicity in modulating the interface dynamics and electrocatalytic performance. Our first-principle computations revealed that Au25 protected by hydrophilic -SCH2COOH ligands dictates faster kinetics in stripping the thiolate ligand and exhibits better HER activity due to enhanced proton transfer facilitated by boosted interface hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Au25 protected by hydrophobic -SCH2CH3 ligands demonstrates enhanced CO2RR performance by minimizing water interference to stabilize the key *COOH intermediate and lower the barrier for CO formation. Experimental validation using synthesized [Au25(MPA)18]- (MPA=Mercaptopropionic acid) and [Au25(SC6H13)18]- confirms these findings, where [Au25(MPA)18]- exhibits better activity and stability in HER, while [Au25(SC6H13)18]- achieves higher Faradaic efficiency and current density in CO2RR. The mechanistic insights in this study provide valuable guidance for the rational design of surface microenvironment in efficient nanocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.

Purpose This study aims to explore how environmental investments impact the firm financial outcomes in emerging markets using a sample of 4,081 firms across 25 emerging countries from different regions from 2010–2022. Design/methodology/approach Fixed effect regressions with robust standard errors for unbalanced panel data are used to investigate the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure scores and carbon emissions intensity on firm profitability. The authors used simultaneous quantile regressions with bootstrapped standard errors to allow for estimating parameters of different quantiles of superior and inferior financial performers. Non-linear regressions are used to test for curvilinear relationships. Two-stage least squares regressions are used to mitigate concerns of endogeneity. Findings The results reveal that firms with less emissions of carbon dioxide report high profitability, however, firms with high ESG disclosure scores do not achieve superior performance. The authors detect a positive curvilinear U-shaped relationship and determine threshold level of ESG scores. Furthermore, firms with sustainable investments have more resilient performance during COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications A comprehensive analysis of the complex effect of environmental sustainability on financial performance in emerging markets uncovers the strategic motivations behind ESG disclosures and the thresholds where environmental performance translates into financial gains. Overall, this study emphasises the significance of sustainable investments in enhancing long-term profitability and resilience in emerging markets during turbulent times. Practical implications Proactive carbon emission reduction strategies are essential to safeguard firm competitive advantage. Firm ESG investments should be considered when forecasting firm value and stock price. There is a growing need for rigid policies to promote a green economy and mitigate climate change risks. Originality/value Offers a unique setting to examine the association between firm environmental and financial performance across emerging countries and regions. It explores the non-linear shape and magnitude of this relation across high-low quantiles of profitability. It sheds new light on the impact of sustainable practices on firm resilience during COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract Sustainability is an imperative requirement in this era, with electrocatalytic power into fuels technologies emerging as a significant route toward sustainable chemistry. One of the focus areas within the chemical industry is capture of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and its electrochemical reduction (eCO 2 RR) into economically viable commodities through the utilization of renewable sources. Despite some specific eCO 2 RR technologies being poised for market introduction, the development of a comprehensive technology for eCO 2 RR remains a challenge. While certain technologies targeting specific eCO 2 RR products are on the verge of deployment, substantial efforts are still necessary to transition and establish presence in the market over conventional technologies. This review highlights recent technological advancements, fundamental studies, and the persisting challenges from an industrial perspective. We take a deep dive into the research methodologies, strategies, challenges, and advancements in the development of applications for eCO 2 RR. Specifically, three eCO 2 RR products – CO, HCOOH, and C 2 H 4 – as promising candidates for implementation are elaborated based on techno‐economic considerations. Additionally, the review discusses the industrial blueprint for these products, aiming to streamline their path toward commercialization. The intent is to present the status of eCO 2 RR, offering insights into its potential transformation from a mere laboratory curiosity to a feasible technology for industrial chemical synthesis.

Impending and increasingly stringent emissions regulations regarding natural gas compressor engines drive the research behind blending hydrogen with natural gas to make these internal combustion engines and their combustion process more efficient. This investigation seeks to answer two fundamental questions: will blending hydrogen with natural gas reduce overall engine fuel consumption, and can greenhouse gas emissions be reduced by blending hydrogen with natural gas? A 4-cylinder Cooper–Bessemer GMV engine, housed at Colorado State University’s Powerhouse facility, was investigated for hydrogen–natural gas blending using multiple engine configurations. A lean-burn engine uses an active pre-combustion chamber as its ignition source, along with electronically activated high pressure fuel injection in the main combustion chamber. One configuration tested utilized high-pressure fuel injection and blending in hydrogen, up to 40% by volume, in both the main chamber and pre-combustion chamber fuel supplies. A second configuration, where the main combustion chamber fuel was solely natural gas and only the pre-combustion chamber received hydrogen-blended natural gas, was also tested. The final configuration to be tested used low pressure fuel injection with mechanically actuated valves in the main chamber with a traditional spark plug ignition source. All engine configurations saw reductions in methane emissions of up to 30% using blended natural gas and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide emissions were also shown to be reduced for the two configurations. A reduction in brake-specific fuel consumption of up to 2% was also seen for two configurations. These results support the hypothesis that blending hydrogen into natural gas can reduce engine total fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Mitigating CO2 emissions is essential to reduce climate change and its adverse effects on ecosystems. Photovoltaic electricity is 30 times less carbon-intensive than coal-based electricity, making solar PV an attractive option in reducing electricity demand from fossil-fuel-based sources. This study looks into utilizing solar PV electricity production on a large university campus in an effort to reduce CO2 emissions. The study involved investigating 153 buildings on the campus, spanning nine years of data, from 2015 to 2023. The study comprised four key phases. In the first phase, PVWatts gathered data to predict PV-generated energy. This was the foundation for Phase II, where a novel tree-based ensemble learning model was developed to predict monthly PV-generated electricity. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique was incorporated into the proposed framework to enhance model explainability. Phase III involved calculating historical CO2 emissions based on past energy consumption data, providing a baseline for comparison. A meta-learning algorithm was implemented in Phase IV to project future CO2 emissions post-solar PV installation. This comparison estimated a potential emissions reduction and assessed the university’s progress toward its net-zero emissions goals. The study’s findings suggest that solar PV implementation could reduce the campus’s CO2 footprint by approximately 18% for the studied cluster of buildings, supporting sustainability and cleaner energy use on the campus.

This study demonstrates the benefits of comprehensive school building (SB) energy efficiency (EE) improvements through building envelope renovations, lighting upgrades, and changes to cleaner heat sources. The parametric study in the building energy simulation software was used to check the application of various interventions on the energy consumption of existing SBs while reducing CO2 emissions with the most profitable return on investment (ROI). The energy savings from window replacements did not correspond with expectations. However, other measures such as the wall, roof insulation, and lighting modernization improved EE by up to 152 kWh/m2 and 41 kg/m2 CO2/m2 annually. The study also points to a significant trade-off between district heating (which reduces CO2 but has a slower ROI) and other heating solutions. The results suggest that climate-specific insulation thickness and glazing type needs are required, and optimal insulation strategies are shown to improve EE by 48–56% and CO2 reductions of 45–56%. Lighting replacement and biogas boiler use were both impactful. The findings support the importance of sustainable practices, which should stimulate educational awareness and environmental responsibility. This research presents actionable insights for EE and sustainable development from within educational facilities.

Oxygen-enriched combustion is increasingly recognized as a viable approach for clean energy production and carbon capture, offering substantial benefits for boosting combustion efficiency and mitigating pollutant emissions, which makes it widely adopted in various industrial applications. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), predominantly consisting of propane (C3H8), is commonly utilized in numerous combustion systems, yet its emissions of soot particulates have raised considerable environmental concerns. This study delves into the combustion dynamics and soot formation behavior of propane, the principal component of LPG, under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, with the inclusion of H2O and CO2, utilizing both experimental techniques and numerical simulations. The results reveal that CO2 and H2O suppress soot formation through distinct mechanisms. CO2 decreases soot nucleation and surface growth by lowering flame temperature and H atom concentration, but it minimally enhances soot oxidation. H2O significantly reduces soot formation by chemically increasing OH radical concentration, thereby enhancing soot oxidation. A detailed decoupling analysis further shows that CO2’s influence is predominantly thermal and chemical, resulting in lower OH levels and an elongated flame shape. In contrast, H2O’s substantial thermal and chemical effects decrease flame height and promote soot reduction. These insights advance the understanding of soot formation control in oxy-fuel combustion, offering strategies to optimize combustion efficiency and minimize environmental impact.

Developing cost-efficient systems for transporting CO2 is key to accelerating the deployment of carbon capture and storage. The present work explores the impact of reducing the pressure of tank-based inland and at-sea transport on their techno-economic performance. The study uses established techno-economic models for CO2 transport, adjusted with the most up-to-date knowledge on the costs of low-pressure containment and transport. In particular, the impact of cargo tank material and design on the transport costs show that low-pressure cargo tank systems can be 50% less expensive than medium-pressure systems if materials with similar price and strength can be used. This results in reductions in transport costs as high as 30% for long distances. This is partly driven by the currently suggested size limitation on medium-pressure shipping that limits its economies of scale. If this limitation is alleviated, the cost advantage of low-pressure shipping compared to medium-pressure is more limited (10–20%) although it remains advantageous. The same scaling effects on capacity were not found for truck and barge inland transport, thus yielding 1–10% cost reductions of low-pressure transport relative to medium-pressure transport. These results imply that future systems may combine medium-pressure inland and low-pressure at-sea transport and that efficient solutions connecting the two must be investigated.

This study analyses a C.I. engine's performance and emission characteristics using ethanol-diesel emulsions containing NiZnFe₂O₄ nanoparticle nanoparticles. A four-stroke, single-cylinder, and diesel engine test rig was employed to evaluate different ethanol concentrations (5%, 10%, and 15%) and nanoparticle levels (25 ppm, 50 ppm, and 100 ppm) in the emulsions. The tests showed clear improvements in engine performance, fuel consumption, and emissions. The inclusion of NiZnFe₂O₄ NPs in ethanol-diesel emulsions significantly lowered BSFC due to the nanoparticles acting as catalysts that enhanced combustion efficiency by increasing heat release and cylinder pressure. Without the nanoparticles, BSFC for ethanol blends increased by 27.17%, 34.39%, and 37.87% for the E5, E10, and E15 samples, respectively, compared to diesel. However, when nanoparticles were added, fuel consumption was greatly reduced. In terms of emissions, the nanoparticles effectively reduced hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions. HC emissions dropped by 50%, 58%, and 71%, while smoke opacity fell by 59%, 69%, and 61% for the E103N25, E103N50, and E103N100 fuel samples, respectively. These reductions were linked to improved combustion, facilitated by better atomization and fuel-air mixing due to the nanoparticles. However, carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions increased slightly due to more complete combustion. The findings suggest that graphite oxide nanoparticles could serve as a complementary or alternative Nano-catalyst in ethanol-diesel blends, further enhancing combustion efficiency and reducing emissions. This research underscores the potential of nanotechnology, including graphite oxide dosing, in creating cleaner, more efficient diesel engines with significant environmental and economic benefits.

Methane CH₄ and carbon dioxide CO₂ are the primary gases produced during anaerobic digestion AD, followed by what is referred to as “other gases,” a highly variable group depending on the type of organic matter being digested. However, one of the most notable and common gases is hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), a gas that, while not a greenhouse gas, is well-known for its corrosive effects and its impact on health and the environment [1]. To quantify gas emissions associated with the treatment of horse manure at the Cavalry Canton of the National Army of Colombia, a direct monitoring system was implemented. Over 45 days, measurements of CH₄, CO₂, and H₂S were conducted using sensors such as the MQ-4, TGS 2611, SEN 0219, and MQ-136, respectively. The measurement ranges of the instruments used were: (200 – 10,000 ppm, 500 – 12,500 ppm, 0 – 5000 ppm, and 0 – 200 ppm), with detection levels of: (10 ppm, 0.1 – 0.65 ppm, 40 ppm, 30 ppm). These instruments were placed in three key scenarios: the manure storage site, the biodigester outlet, and under controlled laboratory conditions. The objective was to generate a detailed analysis of the behavior of these emissions. As a result, theoretical estimates of CH₄ and CO₂ equivalents were calculated for the Cavalry Canton. These theoretical estimates were compared with the data obtained from the monitoring and showed reductions ranging from 8 to 87 % for CH₄, 58 to 67 % for CO₂, and 33 to 65 % for H₂S. These figures highlight the effectiveness of the implemented system in detecting gas emissions of interest from horse manure management, significantly contributing to environmental sustainability.

The overuse of fossil fuels has led to global warming and air pollution due to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2. The toxic effects of coal combustion can be reduced by mixing coal with biomass, which is called the co-firing method. This study aims to analyze the use of co-firing using various types of biomass based on previous studies. The results show that different biomass blending ratios affect the emission reduction significantly. Mixing palm kernel shell biomass at a ratio of 10% biomass and 90% coal reduced emissions by 20%, while mixing mesua ferrea tree biomass and sawdust at a ratio of 75% coal and 25% biomass reduced emissions by 45%. The use of empty fruit bunch biomass at a ratio of 30% biomass and 70% coal can reduce CO2 emissions by 72.14%. Overall, co-firing proved effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the transition to renewable energy, although its effectiveness depends on the type of biomass and the blending ratio.

Abstract. The CO2–carbonate system dynamics in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (NASPG) were evaluated between 2009 and 2019. Data were collected aboard eight summer cruises through the Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR) 59.5° N section. The ocean acidification (OA) patterns and the reduction in the saturation state of calcite (ΩCa) and aragonite (ΩArag) in response to the increasing anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) were assessed within the Irminger, Iceland, and Rockall basins during a poorly assessed decade in which the physical patterns reversed in comparison with previous well-known periods. The observed cooling, freshening, and enhanced ventilation increased the interannual rate of accumulation of Cant in the interior ocean by 50 %–86 % and the OA rates by close to 10 %. The OA trends were 0.0013–0.0032 units yr−1 in the Irminger and Iceland basins and 0.0006–0.0024 units yr−1 in the Rockall Trough, causing a decline in ΩCa and ΩArag of 0.004–0.021 and 0.003–0.0013 units yr−1, respectively. The Cant-driven rise in total inorganic carbon (CT) was the main driver of the OA (contributed by 53 %–68 % in upper layers and > 82 % toward the interior ocean) and the reduction in ΩCa and ΩArag (> 64 %). The transient decrease in temperature, salinity, and AT collectively counteracts the CT-driven acidification by 45 %–85 % in the upper layers and in the shallow Rockall Trough and by < 10 % in the interior ocean. The present investigation reports the acceleration of the OA within the NASPG and expands knowledge about the future state of the ocean.

With the increasing need to tackle climate change, energy efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions are proving to be one of society’s greatest challenges. Special consideration should be given to heating systems as they are prone to inefficiency due to non-optimal controller configurations and the shortage of experts or qualified technicians to optimize the operating behavior. Especially for residential heating systems, more often than not, the target metric is the achievement of specific heating and hot water temperatures by manual adjustments with limited sensor information and with little regard to efficiency. This presents potential for computer-aided optimization based on artificial intelligence techniques. In this paper, we presented a Decision Integration System that is interfaced with a data acquisition infrastructure and allows for the analysis of measured heating system data, the generation of recommended measures for efficiency improvement, and the simulative validation of recommended controller parameter changes. We presented different parts of the Decision Integration System, the interfaced data acquisition infrastructure, as well as the non-invasive sensor appliances used. We analyzed the measured data of real heating systems and evaluated our approach by generating the recommended measures based on rules created by heating system experts, which were then partially applied to the physical heating systems and partially evaluated in simulation. Finally, we compared long-term energy consumption data against the latest monitoring period after implementing the measures. Our results showed an average reduction in energy consumption of 24.52% across all considered buildings, corresponding to an approximate reduction of 8.12 tons of CO2 emissions.

Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products – biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer – through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand’s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.

Summary Accurately reproducing the coupling of fluid flow in porous media and rock mechanics is crucial for the modeling of CO2 geological storage to properly evaluate and prevent the risk of inducing fault instability during injection operations. As an alternative to using monolithic flow/mechanical suites, the process can be modeled by linking individual codes, that is i, a reservoir simulator for flow and a geomechanical package to account for fluid-induced stress change, which tackle the two problems sequentially. We developed a flexible numerical framework from which different coupling logics can be selected (i.e., one-way coupling, two-way iterative coupling, and two-way explicit coupling), which are characterized by different levels of accuracy and computational costs. A multirate, two-way coupling algorithm, which allows the flow and mechanical simulators to exchange information periodically rather than at every timestep, is also available to reduce the computational cost of two-way coupled simulations. In this work, we use this coupling infrastructure to perform numerical experiments aimed at defining whether sequential iterative coupling is strictly needed or not, and which less expensive logic can be used to attain a similar solution accuracy. First, a synthetic test case is used to illustrate the onset of fault instability during CO2 injection operations for different sets of coupling parameters (type and frequency), rock properties, and fault permeability. It is thus possible to evaluate, for a reasonable range of coupling strength, which depends on fluids and rock properties, the optimal level of coupling. Results are strongly influenced by the coupling strength, and two-way iterative coupling should be selected for tightly coupled systems to accurately reproduce the fault behavior. For a loosely coupled system, instead, the one-way approach should be the preferred choice due to its lower computational cost. Later, we consider CO2 injection into a realistic formation, and we analyze the impact of the coupling frequency on the computational performance. We show that, for complex cases, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the reduction in the number of coupling iterations and the reduction in computational time for increasing coupling period.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses of cocoa plants (Theobroma cacao L.) subjected to water stress under flooding in different periods. The study was conducted in a greenhouse at the Capixaba Institute for Research, Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (INCAPER), located in Linhares-Es. The cultivars used for Theobroma cacao L. were cocoa varieties CCN 51 and TSH 1188, the first being used as a scion and the second as a rootstock. The experiment was carried out with cocoa seedlings under stress in a flooded environment, arranged in buckets and submerged in water, under different time conditions. Readings were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 days of flooding. Measurements of net CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, transpiration and water use efficiency were performed, all using IRGA. The treatment 2 days after flooding did not differ from the control treatment (without flooding), while in the treatment 4 DAA there was a reduction in the net CO2 assimilation content. Plants flooded for 8 days showed lenticel growth, showing an attempt to alleviate environmental conditions. There was no interference by flooding in the PI and PII photosystems; the photosynthetic apparatus remained stable.

ConspectusElectrochemistry has been used as a tool to drive chemical reactions for more than two centuries. With the help of an electrode and a power source, chemists are provided with a system whose potential can be precisely dialed in. The theoretically infinite redox range renders electrochemistry capable of oxidizing or reducing some of the most tenacious compounds. Indeed, electroreduction offers an alternative to generating highly active intermediates from electrophiles (e.g., halides, alkenes, etc.) in organic synthesis, which can be untouchable with traditional reduction methods. Meanwhile, the reductive coupling reactions are extensively utilized in both industrial and academic settings due to their ability to swiftly, accurately, and effectively construct C–C and C–X bonds, which present innovative approaches for synthesizing complex molecules. Nonetheless, its application is constrained by several inherent limitations: (a) the requirement for stoichiometric quantities of reducing agents, (b) scarce activation strategies for inert substrates with high reduction potentials, (c) incomplete mechanistic elucidation, and (d) challenges in the isolation of intermediates. The merging of electrochemistry and reductive coupling represents an attractive approach to address the above limitations in organic synthesis and has seen increasing use in the synthetic community over the past few years.Since 2020, our group has been dedicated to developing electroreductive cross-coupling reactions using readily available organic substrates with small molecules, such as organic halides, alkenes, arenes, CO2, and D2O, to construct high value-added organic products. Electroreductive chemistry is highly versatile and offers powerful reducing capacity and precise selectivity control, which has allowed us to develop three electrochemical modes in our lab: (1) An economically advantageous electrochemical direct reduction (EDR) strategy that emphasizes efficiency, achieves high atom utilization, and minimizes unnecessary atomic waste. (2) A class of electrochemical organo-mediated reduction (EOMR) methods that are capable of effectively controlling reaction intermediates and reaction pathways. This allows for precise modulation of reaction processes to enhance efficiency and selectivity. (3) The electrochemical metal-catalyzed reduction (EMCR) method that enables selective activation and functionalization of specific chemical bonds or functional groups under mild conditions, thereby reducing the occurrence of side reactions. We commenced our studies by establishing an organic-mediator-promoted electroreductive carboxylation of aryl and alkyl halides. This strategy was then employed for the arylcarboxylation of simple styrenes with aryl halides in a highly selective manner. Meanwhile, under direct electrolysis conditions, the carboxylation of arenes and epoxides with CO2 as the carboxyl source was achieved. Moreover, through the precise adjustment of the electroreductive conditions, we successfully accomplished the electroreductive deuteration of arenes, olefins, and unactivated alkyl halides, enabling the efficient and selective formation of D-labeled products. Finally, building on our previous understanding of alkyl halides, we developed a series of electrochemical alkylation reactions that enable the efficient formation of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds using alkyl halides.

Background/Objectives: Rhinophyma, an advanced form of rosacea, is characterized by significant nasal tissue enlargement and deformation, leading to aesthetic and psychosocial challenges. Traditional treatments are often invasive with variable outcomes, emphasizing the need for improved therapeutic approaches. This study evaluates the efficacy of a dual-laser therapy (CO2 and dye lasers) in treating rhinophyma. An innovative diagnostic algorithm using multispectral imaging guided treatment decisions, while Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was utilized to analyze post-treatment vascular and collagen changes. Methods: A prospective study was conducted involving 20 patients with rhinophyma. Multispectral imaging was used to guide the tailored application of CO2 laser, dye laser, or both, depending on the predominant vascular or glandular components in the nasal tissue. Post-treatment analysis employed OCT to assess changes in vascular and collagen density, providing insights into the tissue modifications induced by laser therapy. Results: The treatment significantly reduced vascular density from 35,526.75 to 26,577.55 at 300 microns and from 46,916.25 to 35,509.25 at 500 microns. Collagen density decreased from 81.35 to 66.34. All reductions were statistically significant, with highly significant p-values. These findings highlight the dual-laser therapy’s effectiveness in addressing the pathological features of rhinophyma. Conclusions: Dual-laser therapy guided by multispectral imaging provides a targeted and effective treatment for rhinophyma, addressing its vascular and glandular components. The use of OCT enhances understanding of laser-induced tissue changes and confirms significant reductions in vascular and collagen density. This approach represents a significant advancement in the management of rhinophyma, offering improved precision and therapeutic outcomes.

This study explores energy consumption, thermal performance, and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in terminal buildings. Through detailed thermal analysis, this research identifies key sources of heat loss, such as thermal bridges in walls and windows, which significantly increase energy demands for heating. IEQ measurements show that the lack of mechanical ventilation, combined with high passenger densities, frequently leads to CO2 levels exceeding recommended thresholds, highlighting the urgent need for improved ventilation systems. Energy requirements were calculated based on the TS 825 standard and compared to actual consumption data, showing that optimizing boiler settings could save 22% of heating energy without any additional investment. Simulations and economic analyses further showed that adding thermal insulation to the building envelope and installing double-glazed windows with improved U-values could achieve significant energy savings and reduce CO2 emissions, all with favorable payback periods. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental impact of these interventions, demonstrating significant reductions in the airport’s carbon footprint. The findings underscore the importance of aligning operational standards with international guidelines, such as ASHRAE and CIBSE, to ensure thermal comfort and optimize energy use.

Abstract Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies are essential for achieving the 1.5 °C target. Predicting the emission reduction potential of CCUS technology is particularly important for countries to pursue carbon neutrality. However, the existing literature assessing the potential lacks consideration of the structural changes in industrial product demand and the trade-offs companies face between CCUS and traditional emission reduction technologies. This study used agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulate the emission reduction potential of CCUS in China's thermal power, steel, cement, and chemical industries from 2022 to 2060 under scenarios of different carbon prices, subsidies, and technology progress rates. The possible biases of the traditional prediction model were corrected incorporating the structural changes in industrial product demand and the marginal abatement cost curves of traditional emission reduction technologies for the four major industries into the ABM model. The simulation results indicate that under each of the 10 possible scenarios, China's CCUS technologies will reach 100% penetration in the four mentioned industries by 2060, with the emission reduction potential fluctuating between 2,222 and 1,568 Mt of CO2 (corresponding to 40% and 10% share of thermal power, respectively). The difference comes in the scaled-up threshold time point and the growth trend. Sensitivity analyses show that the carbon price affects changes in the emission reduction potential of CCUS technologies the most, while the impact of subsidies, rates of technological progress and oil prices were not significant. The stepped carbon price policy can effectively regulate and promote the expansion of CCUS emission reduction potential, which is worth considering for policymakers.&#xD;

Climate change is seriously threatening ecological environments essential for human survival. Achieving the carbon neutrality goals of industrial parks (IPs), the gathering places of industrial activity, plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and in promoting sustainable industrial development. In this study, we use an AI-facilitated literature review and empirical research to analyze and classify the 12 pathways for carbon neutrality for IPs based on the development nature and carbon flow framework. In addition, the carbon emission reduction potentials of various pathways are quantified using a case study. The results of the literature analysis show that, in terms of IP carbon emission reductions, most research has focused on the energy infrastructure related to energy management and utilization, as well as the service infrastructure related to the carbon footprint and industrial symbiosis. Among the 148 studies, “industrial symbiosis” and “carbon footprint” appeared with frequencies of 1278 and 474, respectively. Additionally, 102 of these studies mentioned decarbonization of energy infrastructure. In total, 11 of the carbon neutrality pathways existed in the empirical research, with the exception of carbon storage, and among them, 7 pathways are applied across all 104 IPs. Case studies indicate that the pathways with greater reduction potentials were the energy infrastructure, carbon capture, and the product and waste infrastructure, with potential reductions of 250,000 tons, 200,000 tons, and 145,080 tons of CO2 emissions, respectively. This study provides valuable references for IPs to achieve their carbon neutrality goals.

The paper presents aspects related the influence of the global gases emissions reduction targets on the design and performances of a propulsion system for a bulk carrier. In a first stage, the key elements of the ship propulsion system: main engine and propeller have been chosen and designed. The aim was to obtain the maximum propulsive efficiency at the owner desired speed. Different combinations: diesel engine-optimal propeller have been designed and analysed from the efficiency point of view. In a second stage, considering the mandatory IMO regulations concerning CO2 emissions, the EEDI (Energy Efficiency De sign Index) has been computed for every designed case. To compliance EEDI targets, it was been necessary to reduce the ship speed, and a new propulsion system with lower speed performances has been designed. In this study, ship hull shapes were given and EEDI be came an important and critical factor in the design of the ship propulsion system. Other potential pathways to achieve emissions reduction targets will need to be identify in a future study.

Background The literature doesn’t contain examples of patients with one lung who were treated with High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) after identifying hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. Discussion A 69 years-old male COPD associated, who had already a posttraumatic exeresis from an accident at work, went to the ER of our Hospital to severe dyspnea. At CT of thorax, an consolidation was found in the left basal region. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypercapnia and severe hypoxemia. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Medicine, where NIV + OLT was administered. We were contacted for a transfer. In our department, a bronchoscopy was performed, which documented the presence of dense secretions. A new antibiotic therapy was initiated and was placed on High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC). The decision to use HFNC was considered for better secretion management, for CO2 wash-out effect and humidified gas mixtures. During hospitalization, the patient adapted to this system, and a progressive improvement was observed. Results and Conclusion Follow-up 30- 90 days showed a significant reduction in blood CO2 levels. The chronic use of HFNC is still under study, we believe it could be a possible solution for patients with global chronic respiratory failure and stable COPD.

China's carbon reduction and emission reduction under the 'double carbon' target requires high-precision atmospheric CO2 inversion data. High-precision atmospheric CO2 satellite observation is the basis for accurate positioning of emission sources. Aiming at the problem that the inversion algorithm is difficult to converge in the existing inversion methods, a statistical method integrating multi-source information is explored to obtain accurate prior profiles. It provides relatively accurate initial values for subsequent high-precision CO2 inversion algorithms in order to improve the accuracy of CO2 inversion. The statistical inversion method establishes a regression relationship model between satellite spectrum and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the inversion accuracy is affected by the representativeness of the sample and the regression analysis method. According to the difference of regional characteristics, the CO2 profile samples are counted, and the sensitivity of environmental parameters is analyzed to construct a representative sample set. It is verified that the profile obtained by inversion is very close to the real profile, which verifies the feasibility of the method.

To estimate the potential and realized carbon emission reductions from implementation of reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Indonesia, we compiled logging emissions data from 15 concessions in Kalimantan and 10 from the Papuan provinces. Committed emissions data were collected for harvested timber as well as from collateral damage caused by felling, skidding, and clearing for haul roads and log yards. Emissions expressed as mean ± standard error per cubic meter of timber harvested, per area harvested, and per Mg of timber harvested (i.e., the ‘Carbon Impact Factor’) were 1.30 ± 0.15 Mg C m−3, 27.52 ± 4.44 Mg C ha−1, and 6.88 ± 0.84 Mg Mg−1, respectively. Among the sampled concessions, felling, hauling, and skidding caused 18–86%, 2–48%, and 6–75% of these emissions, respectively. Potential emission reductions calculated as the difference between observed emissions and those of the five best-performing concessions are 0.67 ± 0.15 Mg C m−3, 21.11 ± 4.38 Mg C ha−1, and 4.20 ± 0.83 Mg Mg−1, which represents reductions of 51%, 76%, and 61%, respectively. Extrapolating these estimates to all of Indonesia using average log production data from 2018 to 2021 results in an estimated annual emissions reduction of 14.47 Tg CO2 from full adoption of RIL, which is 2.9% of Indonesia’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) from the forestry sector.

Silicon-based photoelectrochemical devices show promise for the performance of light-driven CO2 reduction but suffer from instability under photoelectrochemical conditions relevant to CO2 reduction. Coating silicon electrodes with thin layers of metal oxides has shown promise to passivate unstable silicon surfaces, and many different metal oxides can be deposited on silicon using various techniques. In this study, we investigate the fundamental photoelectrochemical performance of WO3-coated silicon photoelectrodes, which were generated by oxidation of W-metal films deposited via atomic layer deposition on both degenerately doped (nSi+) and low-doped (pSi) silicon. Two different oxidation temperatures were investigated (400 and 600 °C), and it was found that the monoclinic phase of WO3 predominates at both temperatures but that more grain boundaries are present in the 600 °C film. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the stoichiometry of both films was found to be 1:3 W:O, and low electron energy loss experiments indicate band gaps of 3.0 and 3.1 eV for 400 and 600 °C films, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry experiments showed that the electron transfer kinetics increased after continued redox cycling, particularly for the material produced at 400 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectra suggest that the observed increase in electrode conductivity is due to the formation of oxygen vacancies in the film. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that charge transport through the films was impacted by the grain boundaries that formed during oxidation of the film. Photoelectrochemical studies on pSi/WO3 electrodes were highly variable, only producing a photocurrent and photovoltage with some samples. Our best sample, formed at 400 °C, produced a photovoltage of 180 mV, which is lower than what has previously been reported for WO3-coated silicon (500 mV). We hypothesize that the variability in photoelectrochemical experiments arose from a roughened WSiOx interface that is generated during film preparation. WO3 shows promise as a metal oxide coating for silicon, but our results suggest that formation of a high-quality interface between Si and WO3 is vital for best performance.

Air pollution from the shipping industry is an ongoing problem that requires exploring innovative technologies for effective resolution. The integration of wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP) technology offers a promising route towards decarbonisation of the shipping industry. The paper investigates possible fuel savings and CO2 reduction by implementing wind assisted propulsion on a case-study vessel operating on a known route in the Adriatic Sea. The long-term contribution of added wind propulsion is analysed by implementing a Velocity Prediction Program (VPP) and available meteorological data for the area of interest. VPP is modified to predict the contribution of wind propulsion to the overall propulsion necessary to achieve the vessel design speed. The case study quantifies long-term fuel savings for ship operating a liner route and harnessing favourable (predictable) north-west winds, complementing the conventional propulsion systems.

This study investigates the adoption of recycled PET BubbleDeck slabs in Oman, focusing on sustainability, economic feasibility, social perceptions, and regulatory support. Using a questionnaire-based survey analysed through SPSS, the research explores key determinants, including carbon footprint reduction, material efficiency, life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), public awareness, and policy frameworks, with stakeholder awareness mediating the relationships. Results demonstrate that BubbleDeck slabs reduce CO2 emissions by 33% and concrete usage by 25%, aligning with Oman Vision 2040’s emphasis on sustainable construction. However, high initial costs and limited public awareness hinder adoption. The study’s regression analysis highlights that sustainability metrics and regulatory support are significant predictors of adoption, with carbon footprint reduction and certifications playing critical roles. Economic feasibility, particularly LCCA, positively impacts adoption, while initial costs present barriers. Public awareness and trust in technology emerged as essential social factors driving acceptance. This research underscores the importance of policy-driven incentives, public education campaigns, and stakeholder collaboration in promoting innovative green technologies. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to advance sustainable urban development and foster the widespread adoption of BubbleDeck technology in the construction sector.

This research discusses the energy transition towards the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) 2060 target in the electricity sector of North Sumatra Province. The challenges faced include dependence on fossil fuels, high greenhouse gas emissions, and limited renewable energy capacity. The study aims to model energy transition scenarios, evaluate the optimal renewable energy mix, and determine emission reduction strategies in the electricity sector using LEAP-NEMO software. This study uses a forecasting-based simulation modeling method with a mathematical approach through LEAP software and NEMO optimization framework. Three scenarios were analyzed, namely Business As Usual (BAU), Net Zero Emissions Carbon Capture Storage (NZE CCS), and Net Zero Emissions Full Renewable Energy (NZE FRE). The simulation results show that the NZE FRE scenario is able to achieve a 100% renewable energy mix by 2060, outperforming the BAU (42.1%) and NZE CCS (70.8%) scenarios. Solar, biomass, hydro, and geothermal energy are the main sources of energy, with solar energy as the largest contributor. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by up to 265.9 million tons of CO2 (70.5%) compared to the BAU scenario. These findings provide policy recommendations that support the implementation of renewable energy, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and fiscal policies that internalize environmental costs. The study also highlights the importance of investing in clean energy technologies to realize a sustainable electricity system in Indonesia.

In this paper, we investigate traffic bottlenecks, a primary cause of congestion that significantly impacts the overall efficiency of traffic networks. To address this challenge, a multi-segment variable speed limit control strategy is proposed to mitigate moving bottlenecks, particularly those on super-long-span bridges. First, an extended macro-traffic flow model, built upon the classic MetaNet framework, is proposed as a state-space model to capture the critical characteristics of long segments, which is a key contribution of this paper. Next, a fast prediction model is developed to forecast traffic flow states in lane-drop bottlenecks with restricted passing capacity over long road segments. Then, a controller leveraging the state-compensation flow model is designed to regulate the future evolution of bottleneck density. Finally, the multi-segment variable speed predictive control (MVSPC) strategy is validated on a simulation platform integrating PYTHON and SUMO, and its performance is compared with both traditional and advanced methods. The results demonstrate that under varying traffic flow levels, particularly in high-demand scenarios, the strategy achieves significant improvements in efficiency, safety, and environmental metrics. These include a 62.44% reduction in waiting time, a 95.32% decrease in potential collisions, and reductions in emissions: 26.4% in CO2, 14.11% in CO, 26.53% in NO, and 32.90% in NOX. The proposed strategy is particularly effective for long segments, such as super-long-span bridges.

The effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies for the remediation of soils contaminated with heavy hydrocarbons has been extensively documented in the scientific literature. In general, high-concentration crude-oil-contaminated soil is treated with high-temperature thermal desorption (HTTD) in order to achieve high remediation efficiency. However, this process has the unintended consequence of destroying soil fertility. Low-temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) represents an alternative approach that has been developed with the objective of remediating heavily crude-oil-contaminated soil in a more rapid and cost-effective manner while simultaneously enhancing soil fertility. The thermal desorption unit (TDU) was employed using both LTTD and HTTD, operating at 300 °C and 500 °C, respectively, with a 30 min residence time in the kiln. The concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in both the LTTD- and HTTD-treated soils was found to be less than 1% by weight, thereby below regulatory standards. The environmental impacts of both processes were assessed using the OpenLCA software version 2.0. The HTTD process exhibited a total abiotic depletion potential (ADP) impact of 1.63 × 10−4 MJ and a global warming potential (GWP) of 414 kg CO2-eq. In contrast, LTTD demonstrated lower impacts, with an ADP of 1.29 × 10−4 MJ and a GWP of 278 kg CO2-eq. The transition from HTTD to LTTD resulted in a notable reduction in ADP by 20.5% and in GWP by 32.9%. The application of LTTD-treated soil coated with coke or carbonized residues has been demonstrated to serve as an effective soil amendment, with the capacity to sequester approximately 50% of organic hydrocarbon contaminants. The results of this study illustrate the potential of LTTD for not only economical and rapid soil remediation but also the enhancement of soil quality through beneficial reuse.

Abstract The Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool for Global Cities (ITHIM-Global) was developed as an open-source tool to assess the impacts of transport mode shifts on public health and the environment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the need for such assessment is urgent and rising. The model simulates the impacts on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost outcomes through a multi-pathway framework, specifically including physical activity, air pollution exposure, and road traffic fatalities. In addition, the model estimates changes in carbon dioxide emissions resulting from these mode shifts. ITHIM-Global employs a quasi-microsimulation approach that enables individualized exposure estimates by age, sex, and activity levels and utilises up- to-date exposure and dose-response functions that account for the non-linear relationship between physical activity levels and health. To demonstrate its functionality, document its strengths and weaknesses, and aid users, the model was applied to Bogota, Colombia, using three hypothetical scenarios, each shifting 5% of trips to one of bus, car, or cycling. Results indicate that increasing public or active transport modes enhances public health, primarily driven by gains in physical activity and to a lesser extent by reductions in traffic-related emissions. Conversely, a shift to car usage worsens health outcomes due to decreased physical activity and increased pollution exposure. ITHIM-Global serves as a flexible, detailed Health Impact Assessment (HIA) tool adaptable to urban areas across LMICs and this article delves into underlying assumptions and their influence to advance generalisable lessons on risk assessment and model development. The modular structure of ITHIM-Global, its covering of individual and population-level analyses, and extensive documentation provide an accessible, evidence-based approach for city planners and practitioners to optimize transport policies that support public health and mitigate environmental harm. Graphical Abstract Highlights We describe the Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool for Global cities (ITHIM- Global), designed for low- and middle-income country (LMIC) cities. We apply ITHIM-Global to Bogotá, simulating impacts from three mode shift scenarios with a 5- percentage point increase in car, cycling, and bus shares. We simulate the impacts on physical activity, air pollution, road traffic fatalities, and attributable mortalities and years of life lost. We describe in detail the model’s elements to aid future uptake, development, and extension to other cities. We discuss strengths, weaknesses, and underlying assumptions to advance generalisable lessons on risk assessment and model development.

Measuring ecophysiological responses of Eucalyptus clones grown under reduced water availability could assist in clonal selection for climate resilience. We hypothesized that clonal variation in chlorophyll a fluorescence was more readily detected than variations in leaf-level gas-exchanges when two-year-old E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid clones (C1, C2, C3, and C4) were grown under rainfed (RF) and water-restricted (WR) conditions were evaluated during dry and rainy seasons, in the morning and midday diurnal periods. The C2 clone was the most drought tolerant as it had a similar net CO2 assimilation rate (A) considering the RF and WR conditions at midday during the dry season, while C1, C3, and C4 CO2 assimilation rates (A) decreased by 29.1 %, 28.3%, and 13%, respectively. This response was associated with a reduction to a lesser extent in leaf water potential, stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rates (E) (ca. 10%, 30% and 13% under WR, respectively), when compared to the other clones during the dry season at midday. The lower leaf to air vapor pressure deficit of C2 contributed to its greater water use efficiency (WUE), resulting in greater total dry mass gain. C1, C3 and C4 were less drought tolerant, decreasing gs, E and especially A under WR, resulting in lower WUE and total dry mass gain. Chlorophyll a fluorescence indexes were better indicators of drought tolerance compared to gas-exchange parameters in definition of drought tolerance of clonal Eucalyptus. Three drought sensitive clones showed low photochemical efficiency under WR, with the electron transport rate being impaired between photosystems II and I, indicated by the greater changes in photosynthetic performance index (PIabs). Under WR conditions, Fv/Fm, Ψ0, ΦE0, and PIabs decreased in all clones while ΦD0 and DI0/CS0 increased, with C2 showing the most stable responses suggesting that the photochemical apparatus was the less damaged by drought. Thus, C2 was the best clone for regions with water scarcity.

Abstract This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and marble coarse aggregates as sustainable substitutes in concrete production, responding to the increasing demand for infrastructure and the necessity to diminish the carbon footprint of construction materials. By partially substituting cement, a material that generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions, fly ash, a by-product of coal combustion, recognizes its capacity to reduce CO2 emissions. The stone processing industry produces marble waste, which, by repurposing otherwise wasted byproducts, offers an environmentally sustainable solution, simultaneously reducing the use of natural resources in the manufacture of traditional aggregates. The research aims to assess the effects of incorporating various ratios of fly ash, ranging from 10% to 50%, and marble coarse aggregates, ranging from 10% to 90%, on the workability, compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength. The results show a moderate decrease in a slump, with an 18.66% reduction at 50% marble coarse aggregates and 30% fly ash, and a significant increase in compressive strength, with a 60.22% improvement at 56 days with 40% fly ash and 70% marble coarse aggregates. Split tensile strength also improved by 35.50% to 36.66%. Non-destructive tests confirmed the structural integrity of the concrete. This study emphasizes the potential of fly ash and marble coarse aggregates as eco-friendly substitutes in concrete production.

UK Government projections anticipate increasing electricity use, provided by variable renewables (i.e., wind and solar PV). A side effect of increasing the proportion of variable renewable generation is increased support costs, including curtailment, energy storage, and (most significantly) the cost of supplying electricity for periods of high demand when variable renewable generation is low. As the proportion of variable renewable capacity increases, demand for supporting capacity increases but the capacity factor of the support generation decreases, raising the support costs. Using nuclear power for dedicated baseload supply makes the situation worse. This paper explores in the UK context an original low-cost solution using nuclear cogeneration with hydrogen production as the main application. Electricity is diverted at low cost to the grid at times of high demand when renewables are not available. This ensures nuclear maintains a high capacity factor. When higher temperature advanced systems become available, using thermal energy storage will increase the nuclear electrical capacity. This “Flexible Nuclear” scenario substantially reduces support costs for accommodating variable renewables, saving GBP 14 bn/yr and leading to an 80% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions, compared to a recent UK Government scenario utilising a large capacity of hydrogen and unabated gas generation at very low capacity factors.

This study investigated the electro-mineralization of chloroquine (CQ) in a filter-press-type flow reactor using two BDD electrodes operating in batch recirculation mode. The optimal operating parameters were established using response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite rotatable design (CCRD) with three parameters: current density (j), initial pH (pH0), and volumetric flow rate (Q), with the mineralization efficiency of (CQ) and specific energy consumption (SEC) as responses. Optimal operating parameters were j = 155.0 mA/cm2, pH0 = 9.75, and Q = 0.84 L/min within a reaction time of 9 h, leading to a maximum mineralization efficiency of CQ of 52.59% and a specific energy consumption of 15.73 kW/mg TOC, with a total operating cost of USD 0.18 per liter. Additionally, an ultra-high-performance chromatography study identified three by-products (4-amino-7-choloroquinoline, formic acid, and acid acetic) of CQ degradation. Furthermore, the phytotoxicity test indicates that the electrochemical wastewater proposed decreased the effluent’s phytotoxicity, and an increase in the percentage of Vigna radiata germination was observed. The carbon footprint of optimized electrochemical mineralization of chloroquine is 2.48 kg CO2 eq., representing a 48% reduction in cumulative energy demand (CED) when the source of energy is a mixture of fossil fuels (50%), wind (25%), and photovoltaic (25%) energy.

Chemical depolymerization of lignin is a non‐selective process that often generates a wide distribution of product compounds, denoted herein as lignin breakdown products (LBPs). To address this limitation, we developed a hybrid lignin conversion approach that employs a lignin‐first catalytic approach on biomass and subsequent microbial upgrading. A Pd/C catalyst was used for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of poplar biomass, and Rhodococcus opacus PD630 (R. opacus PD630) was then cultivated on the resulting LBPs. This RCF approach increases the total biomass utilization by R. opacus PD630 over base‐catalyzed depolymerization (BCD) reactions that were performed in the absence of Pd/C and molecular hydrogen (H2). LBPs generated using RCF resulted in higher cell growth per gram of biomass. Cellulose in the residual biomass after RCF treatment also showed enhanced enzymatic digestibility due to saccharification yields over 40%. Techno‐economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle analysis (LCA) of this hybrid lignin conversion scheme, integrated into a cellulosic bioethanol plant, decreased the minimum ethanol selling price from $4.07/gallon (base case) to $3.94/gallon. Global warming potentials ranged from 29 and 30.5 CO2,eq/MJ. These results highlight the potential for an industrial hybrid conversion‐based biorefinery scheme that utilizes lignin‐first catalytic deconstruction and R. opacus PD630 upgrading.

Objectives: The quantity of CO2 emissions that combustion energy sources in power plants, cars, industry, business sectors, households, and other sectors emit into the atmosphere would influence global warming. Therefore, reducing global warming may be achieved by energy efficiency technology and low-carbon energy sources. By examining how MRV, a ground-breaking REDD+ technology from Indonesia, Brazil, and Congo Governance, transformed forested landscapes into carbon domain that could be observed and controlled via the use of data-intensive mapping and techniques model. Theoretical Framework: To reduce deforestation, REDD+ was initially designed to be a scheme in which rich countries would compensate poor countries with trees (maybe through carbon markets). However, there have been questions over whether REDD+ will lead to significant reductions in emissions. Carbon reductions in the forest sector are becoming increasingly important for reducing emissions and meeting the NDC. Method: This study looks at literature reviews as a research method in addition to giving an overview of the many types of reviews and some standards for conducting and assessing literature review articles regarding carbon emission declarations and subsidiaries in Congo, Brazil, and Indonesia might be used. Result and Discussion: This study should be identified and analysed as follows: (i) Districts and regionals should be given incentives to produce or harvest more timber instead of disincentives from Nation Governance; (ii) State Forest mining fees should be increased to fully defray the costs of reclamation and rehabilitation of areas mined; (iii) Tightening technical requirements for underground mining in protection forests would limit the number of mining permits that local governments could be granted. Research Implications: This study achieved sustainable and equitable growth for everybody, there will need to be greater global collaboration on trade and climate change about carbon emission disclosures and subsidiaries. Originality/Value: This study identified and analysed carbon emission disclosures and subsidiaries in Indonesia, Brazil, and Congo also how to imply the regulations among those country.

The decarbonization of oil rig platforms is increasingly critical as the global energy sector transitions toward more sustainable practices. This paper presents an integrated approach to reducing carbon emissions from offshore oil rigs, focusing on the synergy of renewable energy integration, carbon capture and storage (CCS), operational efficiency, and supportive policy frameworks. Offshore oil platforms are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and their decarbonization is essential for aligning the oil and gas industry with global climate goals. This paper explores the potential of renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind and solar power, to replace fossil fuel-based energy generation on oil rigs. The integration of hybrid energy systems that combine wind, solar, and energy storage solutions offers a promising path toward continuous and reliable power supply while reducing emissions. Additionally, the implementation of CCS technologies on oil platforms is reviewed, highlighting their role in capturing and storing CO2 emissions, thereby mitigating their environmental impact. Operational efficiency and process optimization are also examined as critical components of decarbonization efforts. By improving energy efficiency, reducing flaring, and enhancing digitalization and automation, oil rigs can significantly lower their carbon footprint. Waste heat recovery is identified as another opportunity to convert excess heat from operations into useful energy, further contributing to emission reductions. The paper also emphasizes the importance of policy and regulatory support in driving decarbonization initiatives. Effective regulatory frameworks, economic incentives, and international cooperation are crucial for overcoming the technical, economic, and social challenges associated with decarbonizing oil rig platforms. In conclusion, the decarbonization of oil rig platforms requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that leverages technological innovation, operational improvements, and robust policy support. By addressing the challenges and opportunities outlined in this paper, the oil and gas industry can play a vital role in the global effort to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.

Reducing electricity use in residential buildings, which account for approximately 20% of Thailand’s total electricity consumption, represents a key opportunity for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through the use of appropriate solar absorptance in wall paint, conducted via an energy simulation using a representative residential building model from Bangkok. The DOE2.1E program was employed to simulate a standard two-story house commonly found in Thailand, with an approximate floor area of 120 square meters. The window-to-wall ratios were set at 10% and 20%, and air conditioning usage was modeled for nighttime hours. External wall paint was assigned varying solar absorption coefficients, ranging from 10% to 90%. Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated by multiplying the simulated annual electricity consumption by the emission factor, expressed in kgCO2eq/kWh, provided by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization. The results indicated that adjusting wall paint solar absorptance from 10% to 90% led to a 10% variation in both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, potentially reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 411–456 kgCO2eq per house per year. Therefore, implementing regulations that mandate the use of wall paints with appropriate solar absorption coefficients could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to environmental protection efforts in Thailand.

Sulfate-reducing bacteria inhabit marine and terrestrial environments, forming syntrophic associations with other bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. A notable example is the symbiosis between sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and gutless oligochaete worms found in marine sediments worldwide. These endosymbionts participate in a syntrophic sulfur exchange with the primary endosymbiont of gutless oligochaetes, a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, thus providing otherwise inaccessible metabolic capabilities to the animal host. Here, we used a combination of metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis to describe the metabolic functions of SRBs from gutless annelids. Identified as members of the Desulfobacteria class, closely related to the Desulfococcus and Desulfosarcina genera, these SRB symbionts exhibit a range of common and unique metabolic capabilities. Our analyses revealed their core metabolism of complete oxidation of acetate to CO2 via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, glyoxylate bypass of the TCA cycle, degradation of glycine as a nitrogen source, and presence of transporters for essential nutrients. A large-scale genome comparison revealed that the sulfate-reducing endosymbionts, named here "Candidatus Desulfoconcordia", have metabolic distinctions with respect to their free-living counterparts that could indicate adaptation to the energy and nutrient requirements of their symbiotic niche. The enrichment of functions like peptidases and amino acid transporters together with their abundant expression in the proteomes and the reduction of sugar and sulfur scavenging functions in the symbiotic genomes indicate a symbiosis-driven ecological role distinct from free-living SRBs. Our study revealed the metabolic capabilities that have enabled "Candidatus Desulfoconcordia" to adapt to their multi-domain associations.

Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) is a promising green and sustainable energy source, gaining prominence in light of the dual-carbon target. This study investigated the SGE resources in the Yinchuan area. Suitability zones and the potential of SGE resources were determined based on the comprehensive analysis about thermophysical parameters, hydrogeological conditions, and geological environment. Our findings revealed that the effective thermal conductivity in the Yinchuan area surpasses those of other cities, indicating significant potential for SGE. The thermostat layer depth ranges from 40 to 60 m, with a geothermal gradient between 0.81 and 6.19 °C/100 m. Regions with poor adaptability for a borehole heat exchanger (BHE) are mainly distributed in the western and southern parts of the Yinchuan area, whereas moderately and highly adaptable areas are primarily located in the central and eastern areas, respectively. The total geothermal resource of the BHE in the Yinchuan area amounts to 1.07 × 108 GJ/a, generating significant economic benefits of 1.07 × 109 CNY/a and saving 1.09 × 106 t/a of standard coal annually. This initiative leads to significant reductions in CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions by 2.61 × 106 t/a, 1.86 × 104 t/a, and 6.57 × 103 t/a, respectively. Additionally, it results in potential savings of 0.309 × 109 CNY/a in environmental treatment costs. The methods and models used in this study have potential for similar geothermal surveys in arid and cold regions. The results also contribute essential insights for policy formulation and sustainable development strategies related to shallow geothermal resources in the Yinchuan area.

The perishability and susceptibility to chilling of Carica papaya Linn have impeded its long-distance exportation, posing challenges to international trade investments. This study explores the efficacy of 1-MCP and geranium oil (GO) treatments in enhancing papaya's cold tolerance. Designated concentrations for 1-MCP were 300 and 600 mg/L, and for GO, 2% and 4% (v/v), with exposure times set at 30 and 60 mins. Subsequently, the fruits were stored at 4°C for 16 days, and various parameters such as chilling injury (CI), weight loss (WL), respiratory rate (RR), firmness, colour, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and ripening index (RI) were assessed at 4-day intervals. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in chilling damage in treated fruits. Specifically, the 60-minute exposure to 600 mg/L 1-MCP (MCP600+60) delayed the development of CI symptoms by at least 4 days compared to the control. At day 16, MCP600+60 exhibited the least WL (1.93%), O2 consumption (4.19±0.25 mL/kg/hr), and CO2 production (4.05±0.17 mL/kg/hr). Treated fruits, especially MCP600+60 and 30-minute exposure to 4% (v/v) GO (GO4+30), preserved firmness and colour. In GO treatments, GO4+30 showed the least increase in TSS (1.69-fold) and pH (1.09-fold). The highest TA and RI were reported in MCP600+60 and GO4+30. Overall, MCP600+60 emerged as the most effective treatment for enhancing papaya's cold tolerance and storage quality based on our study.

Globally, 1.5 billion annual tire outputs generate a substantial volume of end-of-life tires (ELTs), creating significant environmental challenges. Despite increased recovery rates, ELT management costs in Europe underscore the need for proactive strategies to mitigate environmental and health risks. This study comprehensively evaluates the environmental impact of disposal methods, including landfilling, incineration, and crumb rubber production, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) via the OpenLCA software 2.0.2. While incineration is sometimes identified as a disposal method, unprocessed scrap tires have potential applications in civil engineering that can better align with sustainability goals. Detailed ELT composition analysis reveals significant recycling potential, with car and truck tires containing 10–20% steel fiber content, less than 1–8% textile fibers, and approximately 80% natural and synthetic rubber content. Recycling 1 ton of ELTs saves an estimated 1.4–1.6 tons of CO2 Eq. compared to incineration. Mechanical recycling and application of recycled crumb rubber in concrete show significant environmental advantages, reducing mass density by approximately 55% and enhancing ductility by up to 40%, according to material testing results. These properties make crumb rubber particularly suitable for acoustic and resilient applications. Additionally, its elasticity and durability offer effective solutions for shoreline reinforcement, mitigating erosion and providing stability during flooding events. When used as a replacement for river sand in cement composites, crumb rubber contributes to a 24.06% reduction in CO₂ emissions, highlighting its potential for environmentally friendly construction.

Abstract The aerospace industry aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, requiring gas turbine engines to reduce CO2 emissions. This will impact engine material selection due to harsher operating conditions, limiting traditional metal/alloy use. While fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) composites are commonly used in the aerospace industry, their use in gas turbine engines is often restricted by the lower operating temperatures of the polymer matrix. However, many studies have demonstrated the tribological potential of FRP in the fan section of the engines, but little attention has been given to the potential of orienting the fibers in the normal (i.e., out-of-plane) direction relative to the wear surface to leverage the anisotropic properties of FRP composites. This study aims to investigate the impact of fiber orientation on the tribological properties of carbon fiber/PEEK (CF-PEEK) at elevated temperatures. Three CF-PEEK samples with different fiber rientations were selected for the purpose of this study (parallel, anti-parallel and normal directions), as well as a fourth sample of pure PEEK. Tribological tests were conducted using a ball-on-disk tribometer at an elevated temperature of 200°C to evaluate wear and friction behavior. The worn surfaces and counterfaces were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The findings reveal that CF-PEEK with fibers oriented in the normal direction demonstrates significantly enhanced tribological performance at elevated temperatures, achieving a 95% reduction in the friction coefficient and a 92% decrease in the wear rate compared to pure PEEK. A wear mechanism has been proposed to explain the superior wear resistance of normally oriented fibers in CF-PEEK, linking it to the development of a fiber-based interface during the run-in phase and the formation of a uniform transfer film.

Today's world is facing a criticalglobal challenge of rising temperatures and disrupted ecosystems, primarily driven by increased carbon emissions. The study aims to determine the major factors leading to carbon emissions in five major carbon-emitting countries: China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan. Specifically, it explores the interplay between economic growth, natural resource rent (Natural Resource Rent: The economic benefit a country gains from its natural resources, such as oil or minerals, after subtracting the cost of extracting and using them), technological change, renewable energy use, and carbon emissions. The study postulates that economic growth and natural resource extraction bear a substantial interaction that contributes to carbon emissions. At the same time, technological change and the usage of renewable energy could probably become imperative to alleviate such emissions. This research, therefore, provides a good insight into the determinants of CO2 emissions in these key economies and the probable pathways toward emission reduction through innovation and harnessing of renewable sources of energy. Utilizing the comprehensive dataset between 1990 and 2021 and employing the ARDL [Panel ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag): A statistical method used to analyze how different factors affect each other over time in a dataset that includes multiple subjects (e.g., countries)] model on the panel data, this study examines both the short- and long-term effects of these variables on carbon emissions, considering cross-country heterogeneity. The results underscore the significance related to guidelines for sustainable development practices and the necessity for these leading economies to lead the shift towards sustainability. By identifying factors that can mitigate emissions and enhance resilience, this research provides useful inputs to the policymakers who intend to promote renewable sources of energy usage along with technological upgrades. This study's results contribute to the existing literature by making it a significant resource for future policy formulation and academic research in the field of mitigating climate change.

Sulfidogenic bacteria cause numerous issues in the oil industry since they produce sulfide, corroding steel equipment, reducing oil quality, and worsening the environmental conditions in oil fields. The purpose of this work was to isolate and taxonomically identify the sulfidogenic bacteria responsible for the corrosion of steel equipment at the Karazhanbas oil field (Kazakhstan). In this study, we characterized five sulfidogenic strains of the genera Pseudodesulfovibrio, Oleidesulfovibrio, and Acetobacterium isolated from the formation water of the Karazhanbas oil field (Kazakhstan). Sulfate-reducing strain 9FUST revealed 98.9% similarity of the 16S rRNA gene sequence with the closely related strain ‘Pseudodesulfovibrio methanolicus’ 5S69T and was studied in detail to enhance the taxonomic resolution. Strain 9FUST grew optimally at 23–28 °C, pH 6.5, and 0–2% (w/v) NaCl. The strain used lactate, pyruvate, methanol, ethanol, fructose, ribose, and H2/CO2 (in the presence of acetate) as carbon and energy sources for sulfate reduction. Iso-C17:1 ω11, C15:0, iso-C15:0, and C16:0 were the predominant fatty acids. The genome is 4.20 Mbp with a G + C content of 64.0%. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values with Pseudodesulfovibrio spp. genomes were 72.5–91.6% (<95%) and 18.5–45.0% (<70%), respectively, and supported our conclusion that 9FUST (=VKM B-3654T = KCTC 25498T) belonged to a novel Pseudodesulfovibrio species, for which the name Pseudodesulfovibrio karagichevae sp. nov. is proposed. Pangenome analysis of sixteen Pseudodesulfovibrio species and functional annotation analysis of identified genes revealed complete modules of enzymes of the main metabolic pathways, characteristic of bacteria of this genus, and unique genes highlighting the adaptations of strain 9FUST in carbohydrate metabolism, nutrient uptake, and environmental stress response. Isolation of these strains expands our understanding of the diversity of sulfidogens in oil reservoirs and can be used to test the effectiveness of biocides used in an oil field.

Abstract This paper provides an overview of Enbridge Gas Transmission and Midstream’s PHMSA special permitted project to install and use Smartpipe® to retrofit 0.64 miles of an 8-inch diameter, 1965 vintage steel pipeline, known as the Line 3320A-100. The new 6.25-inch internal diameter (ID), 7.6-inch outer diameter (OD) Smartpipe® was inserted through a small segment of the existing 8-inch diameter steel pipeline, which improves pipeline integrity and safety by eliminating corrosion and increasing resistance to third-party damage. Smartpipe® also significantly reduced the environmental impact and disturbance associated with the excavation, earth disturbance, and other activities that would have been necessary with removal of the existing 8-inch diameter steel pipeline and the installation of a new steel pipeline in the right of way (ROW). In addition to an overview of the engineering design and construction of the project, the short- and long-term use case of the Smartpipe technology over traditional materials is explored. Smartpipe® offers a high strength composite pipe liner solution that involves a trenchless installation within the existing steel line to minimize disruption to both operations and the environment. Embedded fibre optics within the Smartpipe® offer real time leak detection monitoring capabilities and ROW activity real time monitoring along the entire length of the pipe. This ESG centric solution not only provides a reduction in carbon footprint when compared to traditional construction methods (open trench pipe replacement and horizontal directional drill replacement) and it is designed to address high consequence and difficult to access areas where operator systems may pass through. Smartpipe® has high pressure capabilities to provide repurposing opportunities for aging, derated and abandoned pipe assets. Smartpipe® is DOE tested for hydrogen use and compatibility with CO2 to provide a bridge to future energy sources. This study serves as a valuable case for industry professionals, offering lessons learned, a PHMSA special permit application template for Smartpipe® replacements as well as education and knowledge on the Smartpipe® technology and installation considerations.    

    

## Completion Design Optimization as a Function of Reservoir Quality in Tight Reservoirs: A Big Data Approach

Summary Over the past decade, more than 40,000 multifractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) were completed in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), making Canada the third largest oil exporter in 2022. However, this process consumed more than 56 billion gallons of water, with more than 30 billion gallons unrecovered—equivalent to the annual water consumption of a city of 1 million for nearly 5 years. This raises concerns about water use efficiency in fracturing operations. Can big data mining reveal the relationship between reservoir quality, fracturing design parameters, and process efficiency? This research aims to develop a hybrid analytical and machine learning (ML) workflow to optimize completion design as a function of reservoir quality in tight reservoirs. To achieve this objective, we analyze data from more than 14,000 wells in the Montney formation. Using core analysis and well log data, we develop a support vector machine (SVM) to predict permeability and a fuzzy clustering model to estimate fracturability. We categorize Montney’s lithology through hierarchical clustering. With 3D kriging interpolation, we fill missing data and create high-resolution 3D petrophysical maps, which help derive a reservoir quality index (RQI) map to identify the sweet spots for completing new wells. We introduce a stage placement efficiency (SPE) metric to evaluate fracture stage placements in-line with the RQI. Finally, we develop neural network–based proxies that predict well performance based on reservoir quality, geomechanical properties, and completion design, incorporating more than 40 completion parameters, the RQI, and historical production data. The results reveal a higher degree of homogeneity in the upper Montney compared to the middle and lower segments. Generally, completion design parameters significantly impact MFHW productivity more than formation characteristics. Applying the proposed proxy to Montney-oil MFHWs could increase fracturing water recovery by 94.4%, reduce injected water volume by 22%, and boost cumulative oil production by 37.9%. The proxy aims to enhance fracturing water efficiency. A 1% reduction in freshwater consumption in the WCSB could save more than 100 million gallons of fresh water and cut CO2 emissions by up to 2,000 tons, equivalent to removing more than 1,000 gasoline cars from Canadian roads.    

    

## Development of high performance cement-based composites reinforced with nonwoven fabrics from sustainable raw materials and textile wastes   

OpenAlex: https://openalex.org/W4405338517

[Laura Gónzalez López](https://openalex.org/A5049732748), No host. None(None)] 2021.https://doi.org/10.5821/dissertation-2117-420258.
    
(English) Currently there is a growing concern about the sustainability of the construction sector due to its great contribution to climate change. Approximately one third of carbon dioxide emissions are produced by this sector, both during the construction and operational phases of buildings. Another environmental problem is the abundance of waste produced by industrial processes and products at the end of their useful life. In this sense, the use of more sustainable building materials and, in particular, the reduction of the necessary amount of cement is of great interest. This thesis focuses on developing and characterizing sustainable cement-based building materials reinforced with biodegradable nonwoven fabrics or produced from fibers recovered from textile wastes, mainly designed to be applied on thin panels for application on ventilated facades, pavements and reinforcement of masonry structures, as well as for the development of multifunctional sandwich panels for applications on facades or ceilings. The first phase of the research focuses on the preparation and characterization of the nonwoven structures. On the one hand, nonwoven fabrics are prepared from biodegradable fibers such as flax fiber, and on the other hand, nonwoven fabrics are prepared with fibers from post-consumer textile waste, both of a technical nature such as aramid fibers, or from end-of-life textiles from fashion, such as cotton-polyester blends. In a second phase, the preparation and characterization of the reinforced composite materials is carried out. The compounds are characterized mechanically (with the bending-deformation test), microstructurally (with observations from SEM and BSEM) and finally the thermal and fire resistance properties are evaluated. In a third and final phase of the research, comparisons are established between the different reinforcements, evaluating the reinforcement capacities that each of these textiles give to the cement matrix. From the results, it can be concluded that cementitious composite materials reinforced with the nonwoven fabrics developed in this thesis become a suitable material for its application as a construction material. Despite multiple works related to the recovery of textile waste and its applications in composites have been published, there is limited knowledge about the combination of raw materials that we propose in this project, as well as for its possible applications. In particular, there is also limited knowledge on cement-based composites in which the reinforcement is a nonwoven fabric prepared from biodegradable fibers or recovered from textile waste. In this sense, composites reinforced with textile waste represent a great advance in sustainability for the sector, in addition to offering resistance properties that are highly suitable for this type of construction applications. The results will help to develop new sustainable building materials with a high content of raw materials recovered from waste and that, applied in panels for ventilated facades, floors and roofs or for the reinforcement of masonry, will contribute to improve the energy efficiency of buildings already reduce emissions generated for the construction sector. (Español) Actualmente existe una preocupación creciente por la sostenibilidad del sector de la construcción debido a su gran contribución al cambio climático. Aproximadamente un tercio de las emisiones de dióxido de carbono son producidas por este sector, tanto durante la fase de construcción como operativa de edificios. Otro problema ambiental es la abundancia de desechos producidos por los procesos industriales y los productos al final de su vida útil. En este sentido, el uso de más materiales de construcción sostenibles y, en particular, la reducción de la cantidad necesaria de cemento es de gran interés. Esta tesis se centra en desarrollar y caracterizar materiales de construcción sostenibles a base de cemento reforzados con telas no tejidas biodegradables o bien producidas a partir de fibras recuperadas de residuos textiles, principalmente diseñados para ser aplicados sobre paneles delgados para su aplicación en fachadas ventiladas, pavimentos y refuerzo de estructuras de mampostería, así como para el desarrollo de paneles sándwich multifuncionales para aplicaciones en fachadas o techos. La primera fase de la investigación se centra en la preparación y caracterización de las estructuras no tejidas. Por un lado, se preparan telas no tejidas a partir de fibras biodegradables como es la fibra de lino, y por otro lado se preparan telas no tejidas con fibras procedentes de residuos textiles post-consumo, tanto de carácter técnico como es la fibra de aramida como procedentes de textiles en desuso del ámbito de la moda, como son las mezclas algodón-poliéster. En una segunda fase se realiza la preparación y caracterización de los materiales compuestos reforzados. Los compuestos se caracterizan mecánicamente (con el ensayo a flexión-deformación), microestructuralmente (con observaciones de SEM y BSEM) y finalmente se evalúan las propiedades térmicas y de resistencia al fuego. En una tercera y última fase de la investigación se establecen comparativas entre los diferentes refuerzos, observando las propiedades de resistencia que le otorgan cada uno de estos refuerzos textiles a la matriz de cemento. Se concluye que los materiales compuestos cementantes reforzados con telas no tejidas deviene un material apto para su aplicación como material de construcción. A pesar de la existencia de múltiples trabajos relacionados con la recuperación de residuos textiles y sus aplicaciones en composites, existe un conocimiento limitado sobre la combinación de las materias primas con residuos particulares que proponemos en este proyecto, así como para sus posibles aplicaciones. Particularmente, también hay un conocimiento limitado sobre compuestos a base de cemento en los que el refuerzo es una tela no tejida preparada a partir de fibras biodegradables o recuperadas de desechos textiles. En este sentido, los compuestos reforzados con residuos textiles suponen un gran avance en materia de sostenibilidad para el sector, además de ofrecer propiedades de resistencia muy adecuadas para este tipo de aplicaciones en construcción. Los resultados ayudarán a desarrollar nuevos materiales de construcción sostenibles con un alto contenido en materias primas recuperadas de residuos y que, aplicados en paneles para fachadas ventiladas, suelos y cubiertas o para el refuerzo de mampostería, contribuirá a mejorar la eficiencia energética de los edificios y a reducir las emisiones generadas para el sector de la construcción.

Climate change poses profound and urgent challenges to the health and wellbeing of people in Australia. With an average of 1.51°C of warming since records began,1 the health impacts of climate change are already being felt across Australia.2 Meanwhile, the health system itself is responsible, either directly or indirectly, for around 5.3% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.3 There is a clear need for Australia to achieve "healthy, climate-resilient communities, and a sustainable, resilient, high-quality, net zero health system."3 This vision is outlined in Australia's first National Health and Climate Strategy (hereafter, the Strategy), proudly launched in December 2023 by the Honourable Ged Kearney MP, Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care. In this perspective article, we review the Strategy's origins, development, and key features; discuss the challenges that must be tackled in the coming years; and highlight the leadership role that health professionals can play in the response to climate change. The National Health and Climate Strategy is built on decades of outstanding Australian work on climate change and human health. Australians have been at the forefront of climate and health research for more than thirty years, and have been pioneers in drawing the global health community's collective attention to the impacts of climate change on human health and wellbeing. We acknowledge the many individuals and organisations who have persistently advocated for human and planetary health for over a decade, and welcome their ongoing contributions and leadership in this space.4, 5 Consultation also highlighted the need to enable and embrace leadership on climate and health policy by First Nations people. Stakeholders spoke of the opportunities inherent in holistic partnerships with First Nations communities to improve health, reduce emissions and foster climate resilience. They also highlighted that First Nations peoples' deep and nuanced knowledge — developed over tens of thousands of years of close observation and sustained custodianship of Country — is not only crucial in addressing the impacts of climate change on First Nations peoples' health, but also can improve health and build climate resilience for all people in Australia. At the heart of the Strategy is an ambitious agenda to transform Australia's health system into one that is sustainable and climate resilient while improving care quality and health outcomes. The Australian Government recognises that insights and leadership from health professionals will be crucial to achieving this agenda. On health system decarbonisation, at the time of writing the Australian Government was working to publish baseline emissions estimates for the Australian health system, and to develop a net zero implementation guide for the Australian health system in collaboration with the Monash Sustainable Development Institute and state, territory and local health service partners. In the future, a key focus in our emissions reduction efforts will be supporting the provision of appropriate care and tackling unwarranted variations in care delivery. This will help to ensure that clinical care is of benefit to patients, and to avoid over-investigation, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The Strategy will also guide work to design interventions — in close collaboration with health professionals and consumers — that reduce emissions while maintaining or improving care quality. Fortunately, improving care quality and reducing emissions often go hand in hand. For example, improving objective diagnosis of asthma, education on inhaler technique, and increasing use of preventive inhalers can help to improve health outcomes while reducing emissions from respiratory inhalers containing greenhouse gases.6 On health system resilience, the Strategy recognises the need to build capacity to anticipate, understand, plan for, and respond to escalating climate impacts on health, wellbeing, and delivery of care. At a national level, this will involve an in-depth consideration of climate impacts on health and health systems as part of the National Climate Risk Assessment, and development of a Health National Adaptation Plan to provide an overarching framework for nationally consistent health-related adaptation. The Australian Government is also developing guidance and tools to support health system climate risk assessments and adaptation planning at a local level. In addition, a voluntary pilot of new safety and quality standards on environmental sustainability and climate resilience for health service organisations is currently being administered by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality Health Care.7 The pilot aims to help embed the principles of environmental sustainability and climate resilience in care delivery and governance, and will inform the next edition of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, which is due for release in 2027. Crucially, the Strategy reaches beyond the traditional confines of the health system, and seeks to promote health, sustainability and climate resilience across a variety of health-determining sectors. Many of the negative impacts of climate change on health will occur via impacts on the wider determinants of health, so it is critical that policies to ameliorate health impacts encompass these upstream drivers. Further, as measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sectors beyond the health system will have significant health co-benefits, there is an important role for the health sector to ensure these co-benefits are considered in policy and decision making. We hope the Strategy will provide a platform from which to ensure that the health co-benefits of emissions-reducing policies are considered and accounted for in the years ahead. The Strategy's Health in All Policies approach is embodied in a wide range of cross-government initiatives at the intersection of climate change and human health planned for the years ahead. For example, in recognition that housing is a key determinant of health and wellbeing, the Strategy includes a commitment to consider the health benefits of climate-resilient housing in developing the National Housing and Homelessness Plan. Given that population health would be improved markedly by widespread uptake of more environmentally sustainable diets,8 work is underway with the National Health and Medical Research Council to consider sustainability in the updated Australian Dietary Guidelines. The built environment is an important source of health systems emissions, and also a strong mediator of climate impacts on health, so the Strategy will promote the consideration of health and climate resilience in future updates to the National Construction Code. In her speech launching the Strategy at the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28), Assistant Minister Kearney noted that its release, "highlights a beginning, and ahead of us lies the journey of delivering its ambitious program of work."9 In 2024, the National Health, Sustainability and Climate Unit has taken some of the first steps on that journey. Work has commenced on 31 of the 49 actions within the Strategy, with 12 of those 31 actions completed or in the final stages of completion. Planning has also commenced to deliver a further 14 actions. In addition to publishing baseline health system emissions estimates, the Australian Government will shortly be publishing new academic research about opportunities to reduce waste and make food more sustainable in the Australian health system. We have also been working with industry, clinicians, patients and other stakeholders to reduce emissions from respiratory inhalers and anaesthetic gases. Several state health systems have already shown leadership by removing the high emissions anaesthetic gas desflurane from their medicines formularies, while organisations such as Asthma Australia and the National Asthma Council have laid the groundwork for optimising asthma inhaler use for better asthma and climate outcomes, including with the National Sustainable Asthma Care Roadmap.10 Meanwhile, the interim Australian Centre for Disease Control, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare, and the Council of Presidents of Medical Colleges have released a joint statement in which they agreed to work together to develop low-emissions models of care, and to mobilise and support the health workforce to lead the health system response to climate change.11 In implementing the Strategy, we expect to encounter challenges. These challenges include the need to resist siloed thinking and working to make the Strategy's Health in All Policies approach a practical reality. To help achieve this, we have established governance structures that will support multidisciplinary, cross-portfolio collaboration to deliver the Strategy's vision. Another key challenge will be achieving an appropriate level of national and international consistency, while also balancing the unique needs and circumstances of different jurisdictions. Many states, territories and local governments have led the way in health system decarbonisation and climate resilience to date. In implementing the Strategy, we will be looking to learn from and build on their innovation and progress, and seeking to add value to existing approaches. A key domain for Commonwealth leadership will be supporting international collaboration, particularly in areas that require changes to global supply chains and manufacturing practices. On Earth Day this year, the Australian Government announced that it has joined a collaboration with the United States and United Kingdom to align health system procurement standards to support decarbonisation.12 Commitment to this collaboration was reiterated at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.13 Australia is also engaged with efforts to develop new international standards for measuring the environmental impacts of health technology products. Frontline clinicians were instrumental in the Strategy's development, and will be even more crucial in its implementation. A net zero, climate-resilient health system must have as its bedrock a motivated, innovative, and upskilled workforce, that can translate the Strategy's vision and objectives into reality on the ground. Achieving such transformative change will require effective coupling of "top-down", government-led initiatives with "bottom-up" innovation and reform. The Strategy highlights a few examples of clinician-led initiatives that have already achieved exceptional outcomes for patients and the planet, and embody the creativity, care and collaboration that will be needed in the years ahead. For example, a team in the Royal Melbourne Hospital Emergency Department implemented a campaign to reduce unnecessary arterial blood gas and coagulation profile testing, which resulted in over 1200 unnecessary blood tests being avoided each month, with annual cost savings of $240 000 and emissions reductions of 900 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).3 We heard about dozens of inspiring frontline initiatives — and even more exciting ideas — such as this throughout Strategy consultations, and aim to support those on the frontlines to consolidate and expand their outstanding work. We have been impressed and inspired by clinicians' incredible passion for addressing climate change, and will work to support their longstanding, vital leadership towards a net zero, climate-resilient health system in the years ahead. The National Health and Climate Strategy sets an ambitious strategic direction for climate change and health policy in Australia. The Australian Government will lead the implementation of the Strategy over the next five years, and continue to pursue the Strategy's vision of "healthy, climate-resilient communities, and a sustainable, resilient, high-quality, net zero health system" over the coming decades. This work is a shared responsibility of every health professional and every part of the health system. We look forward to working collaboratively with stakeholders, including frontline health practitioners, to realise this vision in the years ahead.

[Lucía Belén Barandiarán Villegas](https://openalex.org/A5049131177), No host. None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.5821/dissertation-2117-420576.
    
(English) To address the impacts of climate change, several measures have been suggested among which utilizing renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy and implementing technologies such as hydrogen storage or CCUS. Some of these solutions imply the injection of fluids into fractured rock masses (e.g. depleted O&G reservoirs) with the subsequent change in local stress conditions. This alteration may lead to the initiation of micro-seismic events by reactivating existing faults or the generation of new fractures, with the risk of ultimately establishing pathways for fluid leakage. Additionally, depleted reservoirs contain multiphase and multicomponent fluids that could react chemically with the new injection fluids. Therefore, the accurate prediction of operation conditions demands advanced geomechanical software capable of evaluating the viability and safety of potential extraction or storage locations. In this context, the main objective of this thesis is to develop a thermo-hydro-mechanical multiphase model in fractured porous medium with the Finite Element Method using zero-thickness interface elements to model discrete discontinuities. The main assumptions of the model are: the small strain theory, the system composition with two fluid phases (liquid and gas), two species (water and dry gas) and one solid phase. The gas phase follows the ideal gas law and the liquid phase evaporation is considered. The main variables are: displacements, phase pressures and temperature. The formulation takes into account: the equilibrium equation, the mass balance equation of the water species, the mass balance equation of the gas species and the balance of energy. The formulation of the discontinuities considers similar assumptions as the porous medium and takes into account a reduction factor of the water retention curve parameters based on the mechanical opening of the fracture. The model has been implemented and validated with academic verification examples in a FE code. However, some limitations were observed related to the time integration scheme, the treatment of storage terms of the governing equations and the mass flow. This issues have motivated the following new developments: new mass-conservative approach for diffusion equations using FE formulations, a new physically-based exponential model which considers the pore size or aperture distribution in case of the porous medium or discontinuities, respectively, and a new damage-frictional law which properly models discontinuity closure. (Català) Per mitigar les conseqüències del canvi climàtic s'han proposat diverses mesures, entre les quals es troben l'ús d'energies renovables com la geotèrmia i el desenvolupament de tecnologies com l'emmagatzematge d'hidrogen o CO₂, que requereixen la injecció de fluids dins de massissos rocosos fracturats (com els reservoris abandonats), cosa que suposa un canvi en l'estat tensional d'aquests. Aquesta alteració pot ocasionar el desencadenament d'esdeveniments micro-sísimics mitjançant la reactivació de falles geològiques o la creació de noves fractures que, en última instància, formarien camins preferencials per a la filtració dels fluids. A més, els reservoris abandonats contenen fluids multifase amb més d'una espècie que podrien reaccionar químicament amb els nous fluids injectats. Per tant, la predicció precisa de les condicions d'operació requereix una anàlisi profunda de la problemàtica, així com disposar d'un programari geomecànic avançat capaç d'avaluar la viabilitat i la seguretat dels possibles llocs d'extracció o emmagatzematge. En aquest context, l'objectiu principal d'aquesta tesi és el desenvolupament d'un model termo-hidro-mecànic (THM) acoblat multifase en un medi porós fracturat mitjançant el mètode dels Elements Finits emprant elements junta de gruix nul de doble node per representar les discontinuïtats. Les principals hipòtesis del model són: la teoria de petites deformacions, un sistema compost per dues fases fluides (líquida i gasosa), dues espècies (aigua i gas) i una fase sòlida; la fase gasosa es comporta d'acord amb la llei dels gasos ideals i es considera l'evaporació de la fase líquida. Les variables primàries són: desplaçaments, pressions de fase i temperatura. La formulació contempla: l'equació d'equilibri, l'equació de balanç de massa de l'espècie aigua, l'equació de balanç de massa de l'espècie gas i el balanç d'energia. La formulació de les discontinuïtats considera les mateixes hipòtesis que el medi porós i pren en compte un factor de reducció dels paràmetres de la corba de retenció basat en l'obertura mecànica de la fractura. El model ha estat implementat i validat amb exemples de verificació acadèmics en un codi 3D d'Elements Finits. No obstant això, durant la fase de validació s'han trobat algunes limitacions del model, relacionades amb l'esquema d'integració temporal, pel que fa al tractament dels termes d'emmagatzematge de les equacions de govern i els fluxos de masa. Aquestes limitacions han motivat els següents nous desenvolupaments: una nova formulació que conserva la massa aplicada a les equacions de difusió en el medi porós i a les discontinuïtats, una nova corba de retenció de tipus exponencial que pren com a punt de partida la porosimetria en el cas del medi porós i la distribució d'obertures a les discontinuïtats, i, finalment, una nova llei constitutiva cohesiva-friccional per a les juntes que permet la modelació del tancament en descàrrega. (Español) Para mitigar las consecuencias del cambio climático se han propuesto diversas medidas, entre las cuales se encuentran el uso de energías renovables como la geotermia y el desarrollo de tecnologías como el almacenamiento de hidrógeno o CO2, que requieren la inyección de fluidos dentro de macizos rocosos fracturados (como los reservorios abandonados), lo cual supone un cambio en el estado tensional del mismo. Dicha alteración puede ocasionar el desencadenamiento de eventos micro-sísmicos mediante la reactivación de fallas geológicas o la creación de nuevas fracturas que en última instancia formarían caminos preferenciales para la filtración de los fluidos. Además, los reservorios abandonados contienen fluidos multifase con más de una especie que podrían reaccionar químicamente con los nuevos fluidos inyectados. Por lo tanto, la predicción precisa de las condiciones de operación requiere un análisis profundo de la problemática, así como disponer un software geomecánico avanzado capaz de evaluar la viabilidad y la seguridad de los posibles lugares de extracción o almacenamiento. En este contexto, el objetivo principal de esta tesis es el desarrollo de un modelo termo-hidro-mecánico (THM) acoplado multifase en un medio poroso fracturado mediante el método de los Elementos Finitos empleando elementos junta de espesor nulo con doble nodo para representar las discontinuidades. Las principales hipótesis del modelo son: la teoría de pequeñas deformaciones, un sistema compuesto por dos fases fluidas (líquida y gaseosa), dos especies (agua y gas seco) y una fase sólida, la fase gaseosa se comporta de acuerdo a la ley de los gases ideales y se considera la evaporación de la fase líquida. Las variables primarias son: desplazamientos, presiones de fase y temperatura. La formulación contempla: la ecuación de equilibrio, la ecuación de balance de masa de la especie agua, la ecuación de balance de masa de la especie gas y el balance de energía. La formulación de las discontinuidades considera las mismas hipótesis que el medio poroso y toma en cuenta un factor de reducción de los parámetros de la curva de retención basado en la apertura mecánica de la fractura. El modelo ha sido implementado y validado con ejemplos de verificación académicos en un código 3D de Elementos Finitos. Sin embargo, durante la fase de validación se han encontrado algunas limitaciones del al modelo, relacionadas con el esquema de integración temporal, en cuanto al tratamiento de los términos de almacenamiento de las ecuaciones de gobierno y los flujos másicos. Estas limitaciones han motivado los siguientes nuevos desarrollos: una nueva formulación de conservación de la masa aplicada a ecuaciones de difusión en el medio poroso y en las discontinuidades, una nueva curva de retención de tipo exponencial que toma como punto de partida la porosimetría en el caso del medio poroso y la distribución de aperturas en las discontinuidades, y, por último, una nueva ley constitutiva cohesivo-friccional para las juntas que permite la modelación del cierre en descarga.
