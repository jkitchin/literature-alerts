The escalating demand for Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) schemes to mitigate CO2 emissions has propelled research into more efficient methods of CO2 conversion, such as the production of formic acid. While traditional approaches often require harsh operating conditions and substantial energy inputs, photocatalysis offers a promising alternative by harnessing CO2, water, and light for formic acid production. This study evaluates the performance and reaction kinetics of CO2 capture and conversion to formic acid using an integrated membrane contactor and photocatalytic process. Investigation into various CO2 absorbents and reduction catalysts reveals that TEA achieves a CO2 loading of 0.957 moles of CO2/mole of solvent, while NaOH achieves 0.75 moles of CO2/mole of solvent over a 4-hour operation period. Subsequent photoreduction of CO2 results in formic acid concentration of 15.89 ppm using ZnO and 10.16 ppm using TiO2 within the same 4-hour operation period at a gas flow rate of 800 ml/min. The rate of CO2 photoreduction to formic acid emerges as the limiting factor in this integrated process, indicating a need for further optimization. Key parameters identified for optimal performance include a UV source of 500 W, a medium pH of 10, and a catalyst loading of 0.5 g/L. This study contributes to the advancement of CCU technologies by demonstrating the feasibility of integrating CO2 capture and photoreduction using membrane contactors and photocatalytic systems, paving the way for sustainable formic acid production.

Abstract The effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable chemical fuels relies significantly on the donation of multiple electrons. Its efficiency is closely linked to both the density and lifetime of excited charge carriers. In this study, a hybrid catalyst system comprising covalently bonded InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) and Re‐complexes is showcased. The electronic band alignment between the QDs and the Re‐complexes is revealed to dominate the multi‐electron transfer process for photocatalytic conversion to methane (CH 4 ). Notably, the size of the QDs is found to be a determining parameter. Among the three QD sizes investigated, transient absorption spectroscopy studies unveil that rapid multi‐electron transfer from the QDs to the Re‐catalyst occurs in smaller QDs (2.3 nm) due to the substantial driving force. Consequently, the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 is significantly enhanced with a turnover number of 6, corresponding to the overall apparent quantum yield of ≈1%. This research underscores the possibilities of engineering multi‐electron transfer by manipulating the electronic band alignment within a catalytic system. This can serve as a guide for optimizing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

Abstract Renewable electricity‐powered nitrate/carbon dioxide co‐reduction reaction toward urea production paves an attractive alternative to industrial urea processes and offers a clean on‐site approach to closing the global nitrogen cycle. However, its large‐scale implantation is severely impeded by challenging C‐N coupling and requires electrocatalysts with high activity/selectivity. Here, cobalt‐nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) is proposed as a catalyst electrode to boost yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward urea electrosynthesis with enhanced C‐N coupling. Such Co NPs@C renders superb urea‐producing activity with a high FE reaching 54.3% and a urea yield of 2217.5 μg h –1 mg cat. –1 , much superior to the Co NPs and C nanosheet counterparts, and meanwhile shows strong stability. The Co NPs@C affords rich catalytically active sites, fast reactants diffusion, and sufficient catalytic surfaces‐electrolyte contacts with favored charge and ion transfer efficiencies. The theoretical calculations reveal that the high‐rate formation of *CO and *NH 2 intermediates is crucial for facilitating urea synthesis. This article is protected by copyright.

Abstract CO2 capture and concentration (CCC) is critical to carbon negative technologies and can reduce or eliminate carbon emission of current industrial processes. A popular method for electrochemically-driven CCC uses redox carriers that bind and release CO2 depending on their oxidation state. Two critical properties of redox carriers are the reduction potential required to ‘activate’ the redox carrier for CO2 capture and the CO2 binding constant. The former impacts the stability of the redox carrier towards oxidants such as O2, while the later determines the concentration levels of CO2 that can be captured. Quinones have been heavily studied as redox carriers. However, the impact of electrolyte on these properties has not been systematically explored. The reduction potential and the CO2 binding constant for 6 quinones and 3 alkylammonium hexafluorophophate electrolytes are quantified in acetonitrile. While alkylammonium cations are often considered inert and interchangeable, our studies show up to 100 mV changes in reduction potential with minimal changes to the CO2 binding constant.

The design of multimetal catalysts holds immense significance for efficient CO2 capture and its conversion into economically valuable chemicals. Herein, heterobimetallic catalysts (MiMo)L were exploited for the CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR) using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The octadentate Pacman-like polypyrrolic ligand (H4L) accommodates two metal ions (Mo, W, Nd, and U) inside (Mi) and outside (Mo) its month, rendering a weak bimetal coupling-assisted MN4 catalytically active site. Adsorption reactions have access to energetically stable coordination modes of –OCO, –OOC, and –(OCO)2, where the donor atom(s) are marked in bold. Among all of the species, (UiMoo)L releases the most energy. Along CO2RR, it favors to produce CO. The high-efficiency CO2 reduction is attributed to the size matching of U with the ligand mouth and the effective manipulation of the electron density of both ligand and bimetals. The mechanism in which heterobimetals synergetically capture and reduce CO2 has been postulated. This establishes a reference in elaborating on the complicated heterogeneous catalysis.

## Reduction of Iron Oxides for CO2 Capture Materials

The iron industry is the largest energy-consuming manufacturing sector in the world, emitting 4–5% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2). The development of iron-based systems for CO2 capture and storage could effectively contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. A wide set of different iron oxides, such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and wüstite (Fe(1−y)O) could in fact be employed for CO2 capture at room temperature and pressure upon an investigation of their capturing properties. In order to achieve the most functional iron oxide form for CO2 capture, starting from Fe2O3, a reducing agent such as hydrogen (H2) or carbon monoxide (CO) can be employed. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art and recent advances on the different iron oxide materials employed, as well as on their reduction reactions with H2 and CO.

This dataset contains 344 different digitized and tagged Tafel slope datasets from the CO2 reduction literature. We re-analyze this data with a Bayesian data analysis procedure that estimates a Tafel slope and yields distributional uncertainty information about its value. We are releasing this dataset along with our study to facilitate re-analyzing and refitting our data using different models and approaches.
