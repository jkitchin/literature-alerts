This chapter discusses the progress in non-Cu-based electrocatalysts employed in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), a strategy for transforming carbon dioxide into useful chemicals and fuels while addressing environmental and energy concerns. While Cu-based catalysts have been largely explored, high production costs necessitate a shift in focus toward non-Cu-based catalysts, particularly those facilitating selective production of carbon monoxide (CO) and formate. This chapter provides insight into the performance of these catalysts and highlights the significance of understanding their structure–performance relationships. Simultaneously, it emphasizes the need for consistent exploration of innovative, high-performing catalysts, development of enhanced characterization techniques, and understanding how reaction conditions influence CO 2 RR efficiency. Moreover, this chapter also offers a comprehensive but succinct perspective on the challenges and future trajectories of non-Cu-based catalysts in CO 2 RR.

Given the increasingly severe global climate change and energy crisis, the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into very valuable chemicals has been proposed as an attractive solution. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) represents a remarkably efficient pathway for reducing CO2 under mild conditions. Metal cluster-based crystalline materials (MCMs) have garnered significant interest in the area of CO2RR because of their elevated concentration of active sites, tunable backbone structures, and excellent stability. These materials enable precise control of metal valence states and charge transfer pathways, offering a variety of reduction pathways for CO2RR. Herein, we examine the utilization of MCMs in eCO2RR in recent years. We cover the fundamental principles of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the synthesis approaches for these materials, and the connection between structural characteristics and catalytic performance. Additionally, the paper delves into the challenges and opportunities presented by MCMs for enhancing CO2RR efficiency and selectivity. Herein, we aim to provide researchers with a new perspective on MCMs in the field of eCO2RR, thereby improving understanding of the relationship between structure and performance. Ultimately, this work seeks to advance the technology for eCO2RR, contributing significantly to sustainable energy production and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.

The hangman structure plays a critical role in determining the reaction rates of molecular CO2 electrocatalysis through constructing pendant functional groups in secondary coordination spheres of metal active sites. However, achieving hangman structures commonly requires complicated asymmetric synthesis. It is necessary to search for simple alternative strategies to develop hangman molecular electrocatalysis with realization of the concept of green chemistry. In this work, we report the synthesis of hangman molecular electrocatalysts based on the noncovalent π–π interaction between cobalt (Co) phthalocyanine nanotubes and 1-aminopyrene. It promoted the kinetics of interfacial inner and outer sphere electron transfer on the complex and chemisorption of *COOH and *CO species through interaction with both Co sites and pendant amine groups in a bridge geometry. The resultant Co sites afforded a very high turnover frequency of 4.37 s–1 at an overpotential of 0.29 V for electrochemical CO2 to CO conversion and thus afforded an industrial interest current density being steady at 350 mA cm–2.

Selectivity is an essential aspect in catalysis. At present, the improvement of the selectivity for complex reactions with multiple pathways/products, for example the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), can usually be achieved for only one pathway/product. It is still a challenge to reversibly modulate the selectivity between two reaction pathways or products of the CO2RR by one catalyst. Here, we propose the reversible modulation of selectivity between two products via spin crossover. By employing first-principles calculations, six spin crossover molecular catalysts are found among 17 kinds of transition metal embedded porphyrin derivatives (ppy_TM), where the changes in axial ligand configurations can reversibly switch the spin state of catalysts between high spin and low spin. For ppy_Os and ppy_Ru, the alteration in spin state can effectively influence the reduction of CO2 into either formic acid or carbon monoxide by changing the relative stability of the key intermediates *COOH and *HCOO.

Achieving a carbon-neutral society requires strategies that seamlessly integrate environmental sustainability with economic viability. Solid oxide electrochemical reactors (SOERs) hold the potential to concurrently recycle CO2 while synthesizing high-value propylene from low-cost gases using surplus renewable electricity. However, existing SOER designs face significant challenges in slow reaction kinetics and instability. We present evidence that Fe-Ni-Ru alloy@FeOx core-shell nanoparticles on the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.4Ni0.05Ru0.05O6-δ electrode of SOER substantially enhance electrochemical CO2 reduction at the cathode, and propane conversion to propylene and ethylene at the anode through the promotion of active oxygen species at the surfaces. The formation of core-shell nanoparticles lowers the activation energy of polarization resistance from 2.1 eV to 0.82 eV, facilitating high current densities and 150 h of stable SOER operation with an 80% selectivity for propylene and ethylene production. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this enhancement is due to the reduced activation energy for dissociative CO2 reduction on the surface of Fe-Ni-Ru alloy@FeOx core-shell nanoparticles. These results show the potential of the self-organized core-shell nanoparticles in SOERs for economical CO2 recycling, offering a promising approach in the pursuit of a carbon-neutral future.

One of the most challenging aspects of manipulating the flow of fluids in subsurfaces is to control their flow direction and flow behavior. This can be especially challenging for compressible fluids, such as CO2, and for multiphase flow, including both water and carbon dioxide (CO2). This research studies the ability of two crosslinked polymers, including hydrolyzed polyacrylamide and acrylic acid/hydrolyzed polyacrylamide crosslinked polymers, to reduce the permeability of both CO2 and formation water using different salinities and permeability values and in the presence of crude oil under different injection rates. The result showed that both polymers managed to reduce the permeability of water effectively; however, their CO2 permeability-reduction potential was much lower, with the CO2 permeability reduction being less than 50% of the water reduction potential in the majority of the experiments. This was mainly due to the high flow rate of the CO2 compared to the water, which resulted in significant shearing of the crosslinked polymer. The crosslinked polymers’ swelling ratios were impacted differently based on the salinity, with the maximum swelling ratio being 9.8. The HPAM polymer was negatively affected by the presence of crude oil, whereas increasing salinity improved its performance greatly. All in all, both polymers had a higher permeability reduction for the formation water compared to CO2 under all conditions. This research can help improve the applicability of CO2-enhanced oil recovery and CO2 storage in depleted oil reservoirs. The ability of the crosslinked polymers to improve CO2 storage will be a main focus of future research.

The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to optimize urban planning and reduce CO2 emissions. In the context of increasing urbanization and green-house gas emissions, cities are faced with the need to find innovative solutions for sustainable development. AI provides a wide range of tools for data analysis, modeling and prediction, which allows developing and implementing more effective urban management strategies. The main fo-cus is on intelligent transport systems that optimize traffic flows, control traffic lights and predict routes, which leads to reduced congestion and carbon dioxide emissions. It also considers the use of AI for energy management in buildings, the development of "smart" homes and offices that automatically adapt to operating conditions and minimize energy costs.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been proved as a promising pathway for valuable chemical production and sustainable carbon cycling. Various regulatory strategies have been explored to boost CO2RR performance. Among these, metal-based electrocatalytic CO2RR systems regulated by organic modifiers have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating the complex catalytic processes. Herein, we provide an overview of the recent effective research for regulating the organic modifiers on metal-based catalyst to enhance CO2RR performance. Two main fundamental mechanisms of enhanced CO2RR with organic modifiers are discussed, including controlling the local microenvironment (local concentration of reactant/intermediate, local pH, local electric field) at the electrode surface and modulating intrinsic catalytic active sites (crystal and electronic structure). Moreover, effective strategies to preserve a stable organic modifier/catalysts interface are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges and prospects faced by organic modifiers regulated metal-based catalyst in CO2RR are proposed. We hope this review will provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the actual impacts of organic modifiers on the development of efficient CO2RR catalysts with favorable activity, selectivity, and stability.

The utilization of renewable energy for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) represents a significant advancement in green carbon conversion technologies. Single atom catalysts (SACs) featuring a transition metal‐nitride‐carbon (M‐Nx‐C) architecture exhibit catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to CO. However, the impact of the morphology of carbon supports, particularly their pore structure, on the electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR warrants further investigation. In this study, we fabricated a series of Ni‐based SACs supported by porous carbon nanofibers through electrospinning and sacrificial template method. We examined variations in microstructure of these porous carbon nanofiber carriers at different pyrolysis temperatures and elucidated their effects on CO2RR catalytic performance. The catalyst obtained at 1000 °C demonstrated efficient electrocatalysis for converting CO2 to CO due to its large specific surface area, abundant hierarchical pore structure, and high content of Ni‐Nx species resulting from both the sacrificial template method and high‐temperature pyrolysis. A Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% was sustained across potentials ranging from −0.7 V to −1.3 V (vs. RHE), with a peak efficiency reaching 96.1% at −1.0 V (vs. RHE). Kinetic analysis indicated that this sample exhibited the highest reaction kinetics alongside minimal charge transfer resistance.

The total control of major water pollutants (TCMWP) is a critical strategy for improving water quality in China, with the added benefit of yielding climate-related advantages. This study uses the emission factor method to quantify the reductions in pollutants and carbon emissions resulting from China’s implementation of TCMWP. A synergy scale for pollution and carbon reduction was constructed to assess the co-benefits of reducing the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Furthermore, to account for regional variations in energy structure regulation strategies, whether aggressive or unified, we developed Pollutant Synergistic Carbon Reduction Pathways at the Regional (R.PSCRP) model framework level to evaluate the carbon emission reduction potential of TCMWP during the “14th Five-Year Plan” period. The study revealed that China’s unified TCMWP employs different but highly effective combinations of emission reduction paths across different regions. Notably, new renovations and expansions of wastewater treatment facilities (NRE-WWTFS) and pipeline network construction and renovation (CR-PNK) together accounted for 89.3% of the total emission reduction. The construction of key water pollutant reduction projects plays a significant role in reducing carbon emissions at the district level compared to direct discharge practices. Additionally, indirect emissions resulting from TCMWP implementation account for approximately 50% of the total carbon reduction achieved. By aligning either harmonized or independent energy adjustment targets, regions were able to achieve substantial pollution and carbon reduction benefits, ranging from 7.5 to 8 million tons of CO2-equivalent.

The increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can lead to climate change and adversely affect human health. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to capture CO2 and convert it into a more valuable substance, such as methanol. In this study, we established a tandem system involving dye-sensitized solar cells and photoelectrochemical (DSSC-PEC), which included the PEC zone using CuO/dark TiO2 nanotube array (CuO/dTNA) as the dark cathode where CO2 reduction takes place, and Co-Pi/blue TiO2 nanotube array (Co-Pi/bTNA) as the counter photoanode. For the DSSC zone, N719/TNA was used as the photoanode, I-/I3- electrolyte, and Pt/FTO as the cathode. The tandem system was constructed by connecting the PEC cathode to the DSSC photoanode and the PEC photoanode to the DSSC cathode using silver wire. Under solely visible light induction and water containing sodium bicarbonate electrolyte saturated with CO2, the proposed devise produced methanol at 1.292 μmol/hour.

Abstract The growth rate of transportation sector’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is rigid, making it difficult to reduce emissions, especially for developing countries. The existing literature has not yet fully investigated the CO2 emissions reduction effect of transportation structural adjustment from the perspective of improving productivity, which is defined by total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) in this study. To close this knowledge gap, we first evaluated the TFEE of the transportation sector as a whole and its sub-sectors in 30 provinces in China from 2013 to 2021 based on the parallel data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and then estimated the energy conservation and emissions reduction potentials brought about by the optimization of the transportation structure based on the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model. The main results show: (1) TFEEs vary greatly across sub-sectors and provinces, with provinces performing differently across sub-sectors. (2) Compared with the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, the structure enhancement (SE) scenario of structural adjustment can cumulatively reduce CO2 emissions by 289.20 Mt by 2030. (3) In the SE scenario, the energy demand will peak in 2026 and the CO2 emissions will peak at 1509.55 MT in 2027. These results indicate that the CO2 reduction from the transportation restructuring (structural effect) can exceed the increase in CO2 emissions following an increase in transportation activity (scale effect) and eventually bring down the total CO2 emissions for the transportation sector, despite the TFEE rankings of the subsector varying across regions. Therefore, policies that value regions with large volumes, a high share of road transport, and well-established infrastructure, can achieve greater potential to reduce carbon emissions.

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) systems are an integral part of sustainable pathways limiting global warming to less than 2.0 °C. When the sole purpose of CDR is capturing and storing atmospheric CO2, carbon registries offer detailed procedures to calculate the carbon removal credits. However, the registries do not address how to distribute CO2 flows when CDR provides additional services. Standardized, transparent rules for distributing CO2 flows among CDR services are required for the formation of efficient private and public carbon markets. The lack of such rules could result in double counting if those reductions are allocated to more than one service, decreasing the trustworthiness of carbon removal credits or deterring the delivery of an additional low-carbon service, thus limiting the economic viability and deployment of CDR. We examine allocation rules in carbon registries and carbon accounting guidelines, including their life cycle assessment (LCA) principles. We evaluate physical (mass-based) and non-physical (economic) allocation methods using a generic CDR system and find both to be unworkable. We then develop a mass balance (MB) approach which can reliably allocate captured and stored carbon (CSC) between carbon removal credits and other services based on the value CO2 removal in those markets. This practical approach to allocation can be used in a transparent way to provide flexibility that would allow CDR services to capture the value of the multiple services they provide and, through this, promote the deployment of these sustainable alternatives.

China’s transportation sector plays a significant role in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollution. Previous studies have predominantly utilized scenario analysis to forecast emissions for the next 30 to 50 years based on coefficients from a base year. To elucidate the current state of gas emissions in the transportation sector, this study employed panel data for 10 types of gas emissions from 2001 to 2020, analyzing their emission characteristics, tendencies, and synergistic effects. Utilizing the Kaya equation and the logarithmic mean division index (LMDI) decomposition method, we developed a model of pollutant emissions that considers the synergistic effects, pollution emission intensity, energy mix, energy consumption intensity, and population. The results show that all pollutants in the transportation sector decreased except for NH3 and CO2. There was a synergistic effect between air pollutants and CO2 emissions, but the reduction was not significant. From 2013 to 2020, the transportation sector shifted from a high emission intensity with low synergy to a low emission intensity with high synergy. The results indicate that off-road mobile vehicles, on-road diesel vehicles, and motorcycles became the main source of emissions from transportation in certain provinces, and a key area requiring attention in policy development. Gasoline consumption was identified as the primary contributor to the significant increase in synergistic emission variability in the transportation sector. These results provide policymakers with practical ways to optimize emission reduction pathways.

The increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and plastic waste in marine environments demand immediate action to mitigate their effects. A promising solution lies in enhancing algal cultivation in marine environments, which not only absorbs CO2 and produces oxygen (O2) but also contributes to carbon sequestration. This study aims to develop biodegradable substrates for algae cultivation, facilitating their gradual degradation in marine environments and eventual deposition on the ocean floor, thereby addressing both plastic pollution and CO2 emissions. We selected various degradable polymers and incorporated differing proportions of algae residue powder (10%, 20%, and 30% by weight) into these substrates. The compositions were processed through extrusion and molded into test samples for hot compression molding. Characterization included assessments of mass loss, morphology, chemical composition, and mechanical strength under both dry conditions and after immersion in seawater for up to two months. The results indicate that the incorporation of algae residue significantly accelerates the degradation of the samples, particularly under extended exposure to seawater. Mass loss measurements indicated that samples with a 30 wt% algae addition experienced mass losses of up to 12% after two months of immersion. Mechanical strength tests demonstrated a reduction of up to 57% in strength due to the incorporation of algae, with seawater immersion further exacerbating this loss. These findings highlight the potential of biopolymer substrates infused with algae residue for effective carbon sequestration through enhanced algae cultivation.

Decarbonization of hard-to-abate industrial sectors, namely the extractive industries, has become an imperative, and thus, processes such as carbon capture and utilization (CCU) have been explored thoroughly and seem to be a promising solution. Carbon dioxide (CO2) catalytic hydrogenation employing green hydrogen (H2) to produce synthetic methanol (MeOH) aims to utilize industrial-captured carbon. A thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of a pilot scale methanol synthesis reactor was conducted by modeling the process using Aspen Plus V12 software. The methanol synthesis model consists mainly of a multi-tubular packed-bed reactor with a thermal oil heat recovery system, a product separator, and an internal recycle loop for optimal efficiency. The reactor has a 5 kg h−1 methanol production capacity, and its heat recovery system achieves an overall heat reduction of 64.1% and can retrieve 1.293 kWh per kg of methanol produced. The overall carbon conversion achieved is 80.6%. Valuable information concerning the design and profile of the reactor is provided in this study.

Mounting pressure on emissions strictly connected to aviation has led to the development of SAF or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, an efficient tool by which aircraft operations are expected to cut emissions of climate altering agents considerably. According to several estimates, CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions could be cut significantly, and the emission of sulfur compounds into the atmosphere could also be vastly reduced via SAF. Though this form of alternative fuel is still somehow challenged by costs, production availability and related concerns, it’s still expected to lead to considerable reductions in terms of aviation-related emissions over the course of forthcoming years. As of today, the attention is almost entirely focused on reduced emissions and how to make the implementation of SAF more efficient, but there’s a remarkable side effect of SAF’s replacement of conventional fossil fuels – namely, its characteristic carbon isotope fingerprint – which could be used to improve estimates and other models at least on local scales.

This study explores a novel solvent-based delamination method that employs a mixture of triethyl phosphate (TEP), acetone, and carbon dioxide (CO2) under pressure and temperature for the efficient and fast direct recycling of positive electrode production scraps. Optimization of experimental conditions led to achieve 100% of delamination within 15 min at 120 °C and 100 bar, with a low solvent consumption of 1.5 of TEP to electrode ratio (w/w). The CO2 allows decreasing the viscosity of the TEP and acetone mixture and so increasing its diffusivity; favoring the binder dissolution and accelerating the delamination process versus other reported processes. This original approach not only enables the reduction of solvent consumption (by 6.7×), but removes the need for stirring, which is often detrimental to solvent-based approaches for scaling up the process while maintaining 100% of delamination. Subsequent to the delamination process, the active material LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) in powder form was easily and fully separated from the current collector, enabling a comprehensive characterization. A more in-depth focus on the electrochemically active material revealed that its chemical composition, crystal structure, and microstructure remained preserved throughout the recycling process. Ultimately, the electrochemical performance of the recycled NMC622 closely resembled that of the pristine NMC622, affirming the promising potential of this approach.

The issue of global climate change is highly critical, and the dual-carbon targets are extremely urgent. The home appliance industry, as a significant component of the manufacturing sector, establishing a green and standardized industrial system is an essential measure to mitigate the impact of global warming. The amount of typical home appliance waste is increasing day by day, and the accounting and analysis of carbon dioxide emissions in the waste disposal process serve as crucial references for establishing a low-carbon industry. This paper employs the life cycle assessment method, targeting the waste disposal process of typical home appliances. A refrigerator is selected as the research object to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions in the three stages of recovery, disassembly, and reuse in the waste disposal process. A comparative analysis is conducted on the carbon dioxide emissions of producing 1 kg of recycled materials and primary materials. The most effective carbon reduction measures for different home appliances are evaluated to provide suggestions and references for promoting the low-carbon and green development of the industry. The final conclusions are as follows: (1) The results of the life cycle assessment indicate that there are significant differences in carbon emissions in different processing stages. Among them, the carbon emissions in the iron recovery stage are the highest, accounting for 87% of the total emissions, while the carbon emissions in the copper recovery stage are the lowest, accounting for only 0.6% of the total emissions. (2) During the process of producing 1 kg of recycled materials, the carbon dioxide emissions in the iron recycling stage are the highest. Compared with the production of 1 kg of primary materials, the carbon dioxide emissions in the primary stages of aluminum, copper, iron, and plastic are all higher than those in the recycling stages.

Problems. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia's refusal to accept the planned volumes of natural gas to the countries of the European Union caused a global energy and financial crisis, and changed the movement towards the development of renewable energy. the transition to sustainable and clean energy sources has become problematic for many countries. Objective. General review and analytical analysis of trends in the development of energy consumption and the introduction of renewable sources in electric power systems in 2017-2023 using the results of research International Energy Agency (IEA), listed in World Energy Outlook (WEO) [1-6]. Methodology of implementation Trends in the development of the world system of renewable power plants to ensure climate neutrality, zero emissions, and a clean ecological environment have been analyzed for the study of the topic article.

The rise in global temperatures, driven by carbon dioxide emissions, has spurred the construction industry to seek carbon reduction strategies. This study evaluates the environmental benefits of using wood materials in construction by redesigning an existing reinforced concrete (RC) residential building in New Taipei City, Taiwan. Four structural combinations were developed, replacing concrete with timber and steel. Numerical simulations confirmed the feasibility of these systems, and comparisons of embodied carbon, costs, and construction periods were conducted. The proposed hybrid models, which extensively replace concrete with timber and steel for the core, reduced initial embodied carbon by 25.6% compared to the original RC building, though costs increased by 3.9 times. These findings underscore the potential of hybrid timber systems as a sustainable alternative in construction, offering significant carbon reduction benefits for Taiwan while aligning with environmental goals.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) can effectively activate inert carbon dioxide molecules into more helpful fuels and chemicals for human life, which is considered to be one of the most potential ways to achieve the goal of carbon neutralization in the future. So far, using electrocatalytic technology to reduce CO 2 molecules into single-carbon products is very mature, but it is still a great challenge to obtain multicarbon products with more practical values. For this reason, it is urgent to design and synthesize electrocatalysts with ultrahigh selectivity, stability, and excellent activity. Crystalline porous materials (such as metal–organic framework (MOF), covalent organic framework (COF), and their corresponding derived porous materials) provide great opportunities for the activation and transformation of CO 2 because of their large specific surface area, high porosity, controllable structure and morphology, and modified framework, making them a promising candidate material for CO 2 RR. This chapter summarizes in detail the latest research progress on porous materials as typical functional porous framework catalysts in the field of CO 2 RR, providing new horizons and ideas for future exploration in this important field.

Abstract This study aims to investigate the challenges and dilemmas that enterprises face in pursuing energy conservation and carbon reduction. It emphasizes that while promoting carbon reduction not only helps protect the environment and enhances corporate image, but also leads to long-term operational cost savings, numerous hurdles still exist in practice. These challenges include technical constraints, high investment costs, and uncertainties surrounding policies and regulations. Current literature largely focuses on the impact of macro policies on corporate carbon reduction, often neglecting a micro-level analysis of firms' motivations and practices, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises and non-high-emission industries. This study systematically identifies the factors influencing corporate energy conservation and carbon reduction through comprehensive text and policy analysis. The findings suggest that policy formulation should take into account the varying sizes of enterprises, increase oversight of larger companies, offer targeted support for SMEs, and work to bridge the capacity gap among businesses. As countries actively implement emissions reduction policies, companies are becoming more aware of and responsive to the need for lowering carbon emissions; however, sustained efforts are essential to achieve long-term objectives. The study provides several suggestions for governments to develop differentiated policy measures, enhance corporate education and training initiatives, promote the adoption of new technologies, improve regulatory incentive mechanisms, and establish industry-specific emissions reduction roadmaps. At the enterprise level, it is crucial to integrate carbon reduction into long-term strategies and align it with the industry supply chain. Achieving the goal of net-zero carbon emissions will necessitate collaborative efforts from governments, businesses, and society as a whole. JEL classification numbers: H25, I115, J48.

The article addresses the usage patterns of plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) under Polish conditions. The conventional approach to operating such vehicles assumes that they are used with a fully charged battery at the start. However, the economic circumstances of Polish users often do not allow for daily charging of vehicles from the domestic power grid. As a result, these vehicles are used not only in a mode powered solely by the internal combustion engine but also in a mode where the internal combustion engine is primarily utilized to charge the battery. An analysis was conducted on various ways of operating plug-in vehicles, evaluating not only harmful emissions but also fuel consumption (for battery states of charge: SOC = 100%, SOC = 50%, SOC = 0%, and SOC = 0 → 100%—forced charging mode). The study focused on the most characteristic vehicle segment in Poland, SUVs, and employed a methodology for determining exhaust emissions under real-world driving conditions. Results indicate that forced charging of such a vehicle’s battery leads to over a 25-fold increase in carbon dioxide emissions (fuel consumption) in urban areas compared to operating the vehicle with a fully charged battery (CO—25× increase, NOx—12× increase, PN—11× increase). Operating a plug-in SUV without charging it from the power grid results in a 13-fold increase in fuel consumption compared to using the vehicle with a fully charged battery (CO—10× increase, NOx—6× increase, PN—4× increase). The emission results were used to evaluate Poland’s charging infrastructure in the context of PHEV usage. The current state of the infrastructure and its development plans for 2030 and 2040 were analyzed. It was found that significant reductions in fuel consumption (by approximately 30%) and CO2 emissions are achievable by 2040. Emissions of CO, NOx, and PN are expected to decrease by about 10%, primarily due to the internal combustion engine operating at high load conditions in non-urban or highway scenarios.

Abstract We performed a retrospective cohort analysis comparing trends in low global warming potential (GWP) inhaler prescribing in primary care in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland between 2018 and 2024 using national prescribing data. There was little change in England, a reduction from 36.6–31.0% in Scotland, a reduction from 36.7–33.2% in Northern Ireland, and an increase from 30.8–41.1% in Wales. Only in Wales was there a simultaneous reduction in high GWP inhalers and an increase in low GWP inhalers. Over the time period of the study there has been a saving of 20,303 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in Wales

As the global community intensifies efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, active carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is being planned alongside emission reductions. The open ocean, which already absorbs a substantial portion of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, is increasingly seen as a promising site for various types of marine CDR (mCDR). All of these approaches are in the preliminary stages of development, and many questions remain with regard to their assessment and governance. This paper discusses the potential role of the newly established Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement) in assessing and governing mCDR. A step-by-step mapping of the various stages of the BBNJ environmental impact assessment process shows that the new Clearing House Mechanism (CHM) could facilitate knowledge pluralism and contribute to the holistic assessment of mCDR proposals. The paper concludes by identifying challenges in operationalizing the CHM and putting forward recommendations to strengthen its capacity for fostering knowledge pluralism in decision-making on mCDR research and implementation.

This project focuses on the development and implementation of a Carbon Footprint App designed to empower individuals and organizations to track and reduce their carbon emissions. By providing real-time tracking, personalized recommendations, and engaging features such as gamification and community challenges, the app aims to foster sustainable practices and raise awareness about the environmental impact of everyday activities. The methodology involves collecting user data on energy use, transportation, food consumption, and waste management, converting this data into carbon dioxide equivalents, and offering actionable advice to lower emissions. The app is applicable across various sectors, including personal use, corporate sustainability, policy support, education, supply chain management, urban planning, and environmental certification. The results demonstrate that informed individual actions, such as skipping a weekly cup of coffee or reducing chocolate consumption, can collectively lead to significant reductions in carbon emissions. This project underscores the importance of individual responsibility in combating climate change and promotes a community-driven approach to achieving a more sustainable future.

Abstract Porous silica–ruthenium oxide composite catalysts were prepared with sol–gel‐based method using a cationic surfactant, cethyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), as templates to form well‐ordered nanopores in the catalyst particles. The previously reported heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into formic acid generally worked as metallic state, while the catalyst in the present study worked without reduction procedure for the catalyst activation to obtain the metallic states of the active ruthenium species. The textural properties of the catalysts in this work were affected by various pretreatment procedures, and washing and calcination pretreatments were identified as effective procedures to remove the surfactant micelle templates with 2–4 times higher specific surface area and pore volumes. The catalytic activity also improved with the pretreatments, and the catalyst with washing followed by calcination showed nearly three times higher activity than the catalyst without any pretreatments. The crystalline size of the active ruthenium species and the catalytic performance of porous silica–ruthenium oxide composite catalyst was influenced by amount of TEOS, the catalyst including small RuO 2 crystalline phase was obtained with high amount of TEOS and exhibited high activity for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into formic acid with comparative TON to previously reported metallic ruthenium‐based catalysts.

Abstract The machine learning methods are hereby proposed to predict the amount of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) emissions in a gasification process, which is one of the most important enabling technologies for carbon-containing materials, such as coal, biomass, and waste toward producing end products of worth, such as syngas, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels. In an attempt to support efforts for improving the emission prediction-a key criterion for enhancing efficiency and further, the environmental performance of gasification-two new advanced algorithms are being applied for the optimization of the model of a random forest: the Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO) and Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA). The tuned RFJS (RF+JSO) was the best of these configurations, providing the least RMSE of 0.593 on test data and the highest R 2 on validation of 0.983, proving to be most effective for the prediction of emissions. This goes to attest that the model RFJS would be a strong tool in real-time-based carbon emissions reduction due to its effectiveness in dealing with major implications from environmental monitoring to regulation and further into sustainable energy production.

The urgent need to tackle climate change drives the research on new technologies to help the transition of energy systems. Hydrogen is under significant consideration by many countries as a means to reach zero-carbon goals. Turkey has also started to develop hydrogen projects. In this study, the role of hydrogen in Turkey’s energy system is assessed through energy modeling using the cost optimization analytical tool, Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS). The potential effects of hydrogen blending into the natural gas network in the Turkish energy system have been displayed by scenario development. The hydrogen is produced via electrolysis using renewable electricity. As a result, by using hydrogen, a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions was observed; however, the accumulated capital investment value increased. Furthermore, it was shown that hydrogen has the potential to reduce Turkey’s energy import dependency by decreasing natural gas demand.

Abstract Erlenmeyer shake flasks are widely used during the first steps of bioprocess development. Despite their broad application in academia and industry, shake flasks usually lack standardized and user‐friendly online monitoring techniques. In this work, the pH and Respiratory Activity MOnitoring System (pH‐RAMOS) for the non‐invasive online measurement of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR), carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR), and pH in up to eight parallel shake flasks under sterile conditions is presented. The OTR and CTR are quasi‐continuously measured in the headspace of the shake flasks using dedicated oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors, enabling precise respiratory quotient (RQ) evaluation. Self‐adhesive pH sensor spots are used for the high‐frequent real‐time pH monitoring of the culture. These prototype pH sensor spots stand out due to their simple sterilizability and subsequent one‐point calibration in the cultivation medium. The long‐term stability of the pH sensor spots was assessed in a 28‐day long abiotic experiment. The novel pH‐RAMOS was validated with different eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Ogataea polymorpha , Ustilago trichophora , and Vibrio natriegens . The combination of online OTR, CTR, RQ, and pH signals allowed for identifying various metabolic phenomena, such as oxygen limitations, substrate limitations, diauxies, and the production or consumption of specific compounds, based on their degree of reduction or change of pH. The high‐frequent and sensitive pH‐monitoring was particularly advantageous for registering subtle and transient metabolic phenomena.

CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is one of the common and effective ways for carbon capture, utilization and storage(CCUS) in China. The injection of CO2 into petroleum reservoirs may influence subsurface environments and further affect microorganisms in oil reservoirs. However, the current knowledge about the impact of CO2 flooding operation on microbial communities and their metabolic functions in oil reservoirs is still limited. In this study, the compositions and metabolic potential of microbial communities in production water from CO2-and water-flooded oil reservoirs in Jilin oilfield were investigated by using a metagenomic approach. Comparative analyses indicated that the microbial community compositions in CO2-flooded oil reservoir samples (GQ43 and GH46) were significantly different from those in water-flooded ones (WQ21 and WH71), with lower microbial diversity. The difference analysis (p<0.05) showed that Pseudomonas, Stutzerimonas, Marinobacterium,Pseudomonadaceae, Methanosarcina and Archaeoglobus were dominant in the former, while Azonexus, Sulfurospirillum, Candidatus Woesearchaeota, Candidatus Methanofastidiosa and Nanoarchaeota predominated in the latter. According to the high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) obtained, some members identified in the CO2-flooded oil reservoir samples might be involved in aerobic alkane biodegradation (Stutzerimonas and Hyphomonas), activated hydrocarbon utilization (Archaeoglobus and Magnetospirillum), fatty acid degradation (Stutzerimonas and Halomonas), fermentative metabolism (Stutzerimonas, Acidaminobacter, Fusibacter, Magnetospirillum, Shewanella, Halodesulfovibrio, Pseudodesulfovibrio and Halomonas), carbon fixation (Methanosarcina and Halodesulfovibrio)and syntrophic methanogenesis (Methanosarcina), simultaneously accompanied by dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate reduction and denitrification. Whereas, a series of MAGs recovered from the water-flooded oil reservoir samples might be responsible for fumarate addition of aromatic hydrocarbons, activated hydrocarbon utilization, acetogenesis, reductive citrate cycle, dissimilatory nitrate reduction and sulfur metabolism (dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation). These results contribute a broad and deep understanding of microbial communities and their roles in petroleum reservoirs especially affected by CO2 flooding operation, and provide the basic biological information for CCUS.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases cause the atmosphere to get warmer. The ocean absorbs most of the heat and much of the CO2. This raises the temperature of the water, which can cause glaciers and ice sheets to melt, sea level to rise, coral reefs to bleach, fish to migrate to colder waters, and sea turtle sex ratio become skewed toward females. The CO2 added to the water causes its pH to get lower, or more acidic, which has its own negative effects on marine biota, especially shell formation in mollusks. These changes can have drastic economic effects as well as environmental ones. Reductions in fossil fuel use are essential to combat this global problem.

High visitor numbers in protected areas can create traffic problems that impact on the environmental protection. In Taijiang National Park, a tour bus project 'Taijiang Fun Tour' was introduced to mitigate various environmental problems caused by private cars. This study evaluates the project's environmental benefits, and those of the various bus routes in the park, in reducing CO2 emissions. The Mangrove route only achieved a CO2 reduction in 2023, likely due to post-COVID-19 tourism recovery. In contrast, the Black-faced Spoonbill route consistently showed reductions in CO2 emissions, attributed to higher per trip passenger numbers replacing more private cars, better road conditions, and longer distances between attractions, that enabled higher bus speeds and lower CO2 emissions per unit time. While it is unsurprising that CO2 reduction is significantly influenced by passenger numbers and bus speeds, the results of this study could be used by TJNP to enhance the benefits from bus use. Starting in 2024, TJNP will optimise routes and implement additional measures to encourage low-carbon transportation.

Abstract Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology is one of the most promising methods for converting solar energy into valuable fuels and chemicals. Silicon (Si), a narrow band gap semiconductor with high carrier mobility, serves as a competitive material for photoelectrodes. This review outlines the research progress of Si‐based photoanodes and photocathodes in diverse economically beneficial PEC redox reactions, extending beyond water splitting to include alcohol oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction, ammonia synthesis, organic degradation, and more. To address the key barriers to achieving efficient PEC conversion – such as slow charge carrier dynamics, sluggish reaction kinetics, and the instability of Si‐based photoelectrodes – the mechanisms and implementation methods for fabricating efficient and stable Si‐based photoelectrodes are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the challenges faced in advancing the commercialization of Si‐based PEC solar energy conversion processes are explored.

Introduction The carbon footprint of severe asthma (SA) and the impact of biologic therapy in this population is unknown. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study in adults with SA, using data from the Northern Ireland Regional Severe Asthma Service (September 2015-November 2021). We calculated annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs; carbon dioxide equivalent) for asthma-related medications and healthcare resource utilisation, compared patient characteristics by GHG-quartile, calculated GHG change post-biologic initiation and explored the relationship between GHG change and clinical response. Results Among 303 patients with SA, mean GHGs was 474 kg ( sd :431), largely driven by SABA-use (50.7%) and ED/hospitalizations (21.0%). Those with highest-quartile GHGs were more likely to have uncontrolled disease (ACQ 3.5 versus 2.5; p<0.001), be more deprived (46.1% versus 25.0%, p=0.029) and have depression/anxiety (35.5% versus 14.7%, p=0.002) versus those with lowest-quartile GHGs. Among patients who received a biologic (n=213), modest GHG reductions (−28.0 kg [ sd :286], p=0.15) were observed, largely driven by reduction in ED/hospitalization-related GHGs (−59.3 [ sd :224], p<0.001). SABA-related GHG emissions were relatively unchanged (−6.1 kg [ sd :138]), p=0.518). Total GHGs were 72.4 kg ( sd :352, p=0.044) lower than baseline 4-years post-biologic-initiation. Although there was substantial clinical improvement post-biologic-initiation, this was not associated with GHG reductions. Conclusions SA is associated with substantial GHGs, primarily driven by SABA use and emergency care utilisation. Although GHG emissions were lower post-biologic, largely due to a reduction in emergency care, the changes in GHGs were modest and SABA-use was relatively unchanged. An improved understanding of the factors driving elevated GHGs is required.

This paper investigates the impact of electrical load management on reducing exhaust gas emissions in Landing Platform Dock (LPD) class vessels. The study focuses on the implementation of Integrated Fully Electric Propulsion (IFEP) systems and Variable Speed Drives (VSD) to enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental impact. The conventional Diesel Engine Propulsion system in LPD vessels often results in high fuel consumption and significant emissions, particularly under non-optimal operating conditions. By transitioning to an IFEP system and optimizing electrical load management using VSD, the study demonstrates a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and sulfur oxides (SOₓ) emissions. The results indicate a potential emission reduction of up to 40%, alongside a 20% improvement in overall energy efficiency. Additionally, the operational benefits of these technologies include increased flexibility, reduced maintenance costs, and extended equipment lifespan. The findings underscore the importance of adopting advanced propulsion and load management technologies in naval vessels to meet stricter environmental regulations and support sustainable maritime operations. This study provides a framework for future research and practical applications in expanding these technologies across different ship types and operational scenarios.

Ship-based transport of CO2 is crucial in developing a carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure. Lowering the ship transport pressure of liquid CO2 from the conventional 14–18 to 7 bar increases the vessel-based transport capacity, leading to significant cost reductions. However, this reduction in pressure necessitates stringent water dew point control measures to prevent the formation of ice and CO2 hydrates, which could block pipelines and equipment. The capital and energy demands of complete dehydration of CO2 increase the CAPEX and the OPEX of the system. It is therefore important to know the limits for water content in the CO2 stream and the consequences if this system cannot reach the dehydration specification due to operational upsets. This study experimentally investigated possible solid formation under CO2 liquefaction for ship transport conditions at 16 and 7 bar, containing varying water concentrations. Using a CO2 stream from a postcombustion amine-based capture plant to represent a realistic CO2 composition, five tests were conducted at different liquefaction pressures and water contents. The experimental results were compared to the hydrate equilibrium predictions for pure CO2. It was found that, for low-pressure CO2 liquefaction with 200 ppm water, signs of solid formation started to occur at about 6.7 bar, which led to complete blocking of the filter over the course of approximately 1 h as the pressure was further reduced to 6.5 bar. This is clearly above the triple point pressure, so the solids that formed were most likely hydrates. For low-pressure CO2 liquefaction with 100 ppm of water operating very close to the triple point and the hydrate formation area, there was no increase in the pressure drop across the filter. For medium-pressure CO2 liquefaction at 16 bar, no indication of solid formation was observed with a water content of 200 and 300 ppm. These findings show the effects of exceeding the current water specification during liquefaction of low- and medium-pressure CO2 for ship transport.

Biochemical networks use reaction cascades to selectively reduce CO2 using energy from sunlight, but can similar selectivity be achieved by applying a cascade approach to an engineered system? Here, we report the design and implementation of a two-step photoelectrochemical (PEC) cascade to a liquid solar fuel: reduction of CO2 to CO and subsequent reduction of CO to methanol. The potentials required to perform the reductions were generated using custom-made III-V-based three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNT) catalyzed both reactions. Multiphysics simulations of electrolyte flow and non-illuminated electrochemical measurements were used to narrow the operating parameters for the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes. The champion integrated photocathode produced methanol with 3.8 ± 0.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE), with tested photocathodes having 0.7-3.8% methanol FE. Products were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The current output of the tested photocathodes was highly stable, and methanol production continued over multiple experiments. The low methanol yield is attributed to insufficient CO flux to, and CO2 depletion at, the methanol-producing subcell when both contacts are active, which is supported by the observation that a control photoelectrode slightly outperformed the methanol production of the 3TT device. Methanol production ceased when the 3TT subcell driving CO reduction was deactivated, supporting the assignment of a cascade mechanism. The major factors resulting in low methanol FE by the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes are insufficient CO2 depletion at the methanol-producing contact and uncertainty in operating potential selection using the 3TT design. Although the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathode is not yet highly selective, this work develops the basic science principles underlying the PEC cascade, demonstrates the co-design of a 3TT-based photoelectrode to produce carbon-based fuels, and finally discusses routes for improving product yields with this concept, including CO2 supply optimization and alternative photoelectrode and catalyst materials.

Since their breakthrough in 2011, MXenes, transition metal carbides, and/or nitrides have been studied extensively. This large family of two-dimensional materials has shown enormous potential as electrode materials for different applications including catalysis, energy storage, and conversion. MXenes are suitable for the aforementioned applications due to their high electrical conductivity, tunable surface chemistry, large surface area, layered structure, flexural property, and hydrophilicity amongst others. This article aims to cover the development of MXene/hybrid structures their computational insight, synthesis techniques, structural morphology, properties, and potential applications in energy conversion and storage devices. Several approaches have been adopted to develop MXene hybrids, such as modifying traditional MXenes by decorating surfaces, intercalating, and in-situ fabrication, to target high electrochemical performance. In addition, this review has concisely and uniquely presented recent advances in the application of MXene hybrid structures in battery design, clean hydrogen fuel generation, carbon dioxide reduction, and other relevant reactions. Finally, the latest trends and prospects of hybrid MXene materials are also summarized.

Understanding the role of metal promoter in CO2 methanation is essential for advancing catalyst design and developing efficient methanation catalysts. Herein, a series of mesoporous Ti-promoted silica materials with different Ti-loadings was synthesized via the aerosol-assisted sol-gel process. These materials possess a spherical morphology with high specific surface area and homogeneous distribution of dispersed Ti species, even at Ti-loading as high as 16 mol%, thus allowing to investigate the role of Ti as a promoter in silica-supported Ru CO2 methanation catalysts. Keeping the Ru loading constant, higher Ti loadings (up to 12 mol%) lead to superior catalytic activity in CO2 methanation. At 300 C, the Ru-mass-normalized CO2 conversion rate of Ru/12%Ti-SiO2 catalyst is 2.3 times higher than that of unpromoted Ru/SiO2 catalyst. The improved activity correlates well with the smaller crystallite size of RuO2 nanoparticles, which translates to higher Ru dispersion after reductive treatment with H2. Overall, Ti helps stabilize Ru species and impedes crystal growth. With a Ti loading of 12 mol%, the crystallization of small anatase TiO2 is induced after RuO2 impregnation and during subsequent calcination, in turn forming the interfacial contact between Ru and TiO2 after H2 reduction. In-situ DRIFTS suggests that the promotion of CO2 activation and CO adsorption at these interfacial sites is responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity in Ti-promoted Ru-SiO2 methanation catalyst.

In 2023, global carbon dioxide emissions climbed to a staggering new high of 37.4 metric tons, a grim situation driven primarily by the massive consumption of fossil fuels, particularly coal. In this context, the offshore wind power industry has emerged as a key part of tackling climate change and emission reduction challenges. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of how productive factors and public policy work together to shape the development of the offshore wind industry in the United States and China, highlighting the importance of land availability, labor market quality and size, and capital investment flows in shaping the future of the industry. At the same time, the paper also carefully examines how the government can effectively attract and promote investors to participate in offshore wind power projects through a series of public policies, such as tax incentives, subsidies and other financial incentives. The results show that China has a clear lead in the offshore wind market compared to the United States. This paper aims to make insightful suggestions for the sustainable development of offshore wind power industry in both countries through comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the two countries.

Summary The CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) technique could increase the oil recovery factor and achieve subsurface CO2 storage. To evaluate the feasibility of CO2-EOR operation, an equation-of-state-based (EOS-based) compositional simulation is inevitable. However, time-consuming multiphase flash calculations limit the application of the conventional EOS-based compositional simulation in large-scale reservoir simulations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to accelerate the EOS-based compositional simulation by reducing the time spent on the multiphase flash calculations. In this study, we develop a fast, multiphase-state identification approach to achieve high computational efficiency of the compositional simulation. First, taking one given point in the compositional space composed by pressure and the overall composition as the original point, the phase-state radius (PSR) is defined as a radius inside which all points have the same phase state as the given point. Subsequently, the results of the multiphase flash calculations of the points in the compositional space are stored. Finally, when a new point is inside the PSR of one calculated point, the stored results are used to accelerate the new multiphase flash calculations of the new point by omitting the phase stability analysis (PSA) and possible additional multiphase split (MS) calculations. Case studies show a 6–10% reduction in multiphase flash computation time compared with two existing methods when the fluid is far from the phase boundary and a reduction of at least 17.5% when the fluid is near the phase boundary.

This article employs a Panel Mean Group Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PMG-ARDL) approach to investigate the interaction between carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), fossil fuel, renewable energy consumption, trade, and their collective impact on life expectancy within the BRICS nations. The research reveals compelling findings. Notably, CO 2 emissions and trade openness exhibit negative and statistically significant impact on life expectancy. In contrast, GDP per capita and renewable energy consumption are positive and significant determinants of longer life expectancy. The nuanced outcomes underscore the complex interplay of economic, environmental, and social factors within the BRICS nations. The effects found by PMG-ARDL and FMOLS are very comparable, except for the trade openness’ coefficients, which is the inverse. These findings hold significant implications for policy interpretation and sustainable development strategies. As nations struggle to balance economic growth and environmental improvement with public health, tailored interventions targeting CO 2 reduction, trade openness, renewable energy, and GDP growth can collectively contribute to longer life expectancy. In a broader context, this research contributes to the global discourse on sustainability, economic improvement, and health issue.

In the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R), electrode engineering plays a crucial role in modulating the distribution of complex products. Here, based on multiphysics modeling, we demonstrate that CO2R product selectivity varies spatially along the thickness of the catalyst layer of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE). Our calculations indicate that maintaining a moderately low local CO2 concentration around catalytic sites enables optimal ethanol Faradaic efficiency on Cu. We further developed an optimized electrode using commercial Cu nanoparticles with a low catalyst loading of 0.1 mg cm–2. Even under a low CO2 feed concentration of 30%, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of approximately 65% for ethanol at an industrial-scale current density of–156 mA cm–2 and over 80% for C2+ products, along with a promising cathodic energy efficiency of more than 37% for ethanol. This study serves as a scalable and instructive guide for tuning the local CO2 concentration to achieve optimal production of a single high-selectivity C2+ product.

In this catalytic process, catalyst activation plays a major role in the overall performance of Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis. Catalyst activation temperatures are considerably higher than the typical operating conditions of industrial reactors. Consequently, ex situ activation is often required for industrial Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis processes. This study evaluated the influence of different activation approaches (in situ, ex situ, passivation and low-temperature activation). Catalytic experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 230 °C and 20 bar·g using a reference supported Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Experimental results demonstrate that catalysts can be effectively reduced ex situ. This work reveals that re-activation of the catalyst after ex situ reduction is unnecessary, as the reaction conditions themselves re-reduce any superficial oxides formed, owing to the reducing nature of the reactant mixture. This approach could simplify reactor design by enabling temperature requirements to match operating conditions (e.g., 230 °C), thereby reducing both investment and operational costs and eliminating additional catalyst preparation steps.

Electricity generation leads to one third of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Standing at the age of direct effect of global warming on global ecosystem, it is required to control global greenhouse gases within limit to avoid global climate alteration. For that, a new concept is proposed in this study for converting CO2 into glucose as well as generating power. Artificial photosynthesis concept is utilized here to design the glucose reactor. Artificial photosynthesis converts CO2 to glucose, integrating principles of carbon fixation, renewable energy, and electrochemistry for sustainable carbon utilization. Furthermore, the synthesized glucose is converted into power in an electrochemical way. A case study has been done based on wind power plant. Therefore, to execute the process, the system is powered by a wind power plant for cleaning the water molecules, CO2 molecule capture, which is synthesized into glucose. Then, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to find how the wind speed is affecting the production of glucose and power-regeneration. The result highlights that the designed system is capable of capturing total emitted CO2 from considered case study within few days. A single unit analysis of glucose reactor is given here. Moreover, the electrochemical system can produce power with that CO2-derived glucose. This concept will be surely benefited for carbon emission reduction, clean power generation, and sustainable development.

Atomically precise gold nanoclusters have shown great promise as model elctrocatalysts in pivotal electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Although the influence of ligands on the electronic properties of these nanoclusters are well acknowledged, the ligand effects on their electrocatalytic performances have been rarely explored. Herein, using [Au25(SR)18]- nanocluster as the prototype model, we demonstrated the importance of ligand hydrophilicity versus hydrophobicity in modulating the interface dynamics and electrocatalytic performance. Our first-principle computations revealed that Au25 protected by hydrophilic -SCH2COOH ligands dictates faster kinetics in stripping the thiolate ligand and exhibits better HER activity due to enhanced proton transfer facilitated by boosted interface hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Au25 protected by hydrophobic -SCH2CH3 ligands demonstrates enhanced CO2RR performance by minimizing water interference to stabilize the key *COOH intermediate and lower the barrier for CO formation. Experimental validation using synthesized [Au25(MPA)18]- (MPA=Mercaptopropionic acid) and [Au25(SC6H13)18]- confirms these findings, where [Au25(MPA)18]- exhibits better activity and stability in HER, while [Au25(SC6H13)18]- achieves higher Faradaic efficiency and current density in CO2RR. The mechanistic insights in this study provide valuable guidance for the rational design of surface microenvironment in efficient nanocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.

This study aims to compare the CO2 emissions from conventional diesel and coconut biodiesel blends from raw material extraction up to use as fuel for public utility jeepneys (PUJs) in the Philippines. This work used the process-based LCA approach with 1 kilometer distance travelled by PUJs as the functional unit. The kg CO2 emissions from coconut farming and harvesting until the use phase of the coconut biodiesel blends in Metro Manila jeepneys were estimated in this work. The calculated emission factor of Coconut Methyl Ester (CME) from its fatty acid composition is 2.5539 kg CO2 per 1 kg CME. The total CO2 emissions in the life cycle of 2% CME blend (B2) and 5% CME blend (B5) were lower by 0.767% and 5.37%, respectively, compared to those from life cycle of neat diesel. In the life cycle of neat diesel, B2 blend, and B5 blend, the use phase contributed 75-78% of the CO2 emissions. The kg CO2 emissions from Metro Manila public utility jeepneys decreased from 0.400kg/ km using neat diesel to 0. 381 kg/km and 0.363 kg/km using B2 blend and B5 blend, respectively. In the life cycle of coconut biodiesel from raw material extraction to CME production, 52-58% of CO2 emissions come from the production of material inputs to the trans-esterification process. Three main recommendations are proposed by this work: (1) Extend the LCA to higher blend percentage. This entails measurement of specific fuel consumption of jeepneys using this fuel. (2) Increase engine efficiencies of Public Utility Jeepneys to reduce fuel consumption and realize higher CO2 emission reductions. (3) Further studies on optimization of mole ratio of methanol to coconut oil in trans-esterification process must be done. Explore use of methanol from sources-other than natural gas- with less CO2 emissions.

Purpose This study aims to explore how environmental investments impact the firm financial outcomes in emerging markets using a sample of 4,081 firms across 25 emerging countries from different regions from 2010–2022. Design/methodology/approach Fixed effect regressions with robust standard errors for unbalanced panel data are used to investigate the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure scores and carbon emissions intensity on firm profitability. The authors used simultaneous quantile regressions with bootstrapped standard errors to allow for estimating parameters of different quantiles of superior and inferior financial performers. Non-linear regressions are used to test for curvilinear relationships. Two-stage least squares regressions are used to mitigate concerns of endogeneity. Findings The results reveal that firms with less emissions of carbon dioxide report high profitability, however, firms with high ESG disclosure scores do not achieve superior performance. The authors detect a positive curvilinear U-shaped relationship and determine threshold level of ESG scores. Furthermore, firms with sustainable investments have more resilient performance during COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications A comprehensive analysis of the complex effect of environmental sustainability on financial performance in emerging markets uncovers the strategic motivations behind ESG disclosures and the thresholds where environmental performance translates into financial gains. Overall, this study emphasises the significance of sustainable investments in enhancing long-term profitability and resilience in emerging markets during turbulent times. Practical implications Proactive carbon emission reduction strategies are essential to safeguard firm competitive advantage. Firm ESG investments should be considered when forecasting firm value and stock price. There is a growing need for rigid policies to promote a green economy and mitigate climate change risks. Originality/value Offers a unique setting to examine the association between firm environmental and financial performance across emerging countries and regions. It explores the non-linear shape and magnitude of this relation across high-low quantiles of profitability. It sheds new light on the impact of sustainable practices on firm resilience during COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract Sustainability is an imperative requirement in this era, with electrocatalytic power into fuels technologies emerging as a significant route toward sustainable chemistry. One of the focus areas within the chemical industry is capture of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and its electrochemical reduction (eCO 2 RR) into economically viable commodities through the utilization of renewable sources. Despite some specific eCO 2 RR technologies being poised for market introduction, the development of a comprehensive technology for eCO 2 RR remains a challenge. While certain technologies targeting specific eCO 2 RR products are on the verge of deployment, substantial efforts are still necessary to transition and establish presence in the market over conventional technologies. This review highlights recent technological advancements, fundamental studies, and the persisting challenges from an industrial perspective. We take a deep dive into the research methodologies, strategies, challenges, and advancements in the development of applications for eCO 2 RR. Specifically, three eCO 2 RR products – CO, HCOOH, and C 2 H 4 – as promising candidates for implementation are elaborated based on techno‐economic considerations. Additionally, the review discusses the industrial blueprint for these products, aiming to streamline their path toward commercialization. The intent is to present the status of eCO 2 RR, offering insights into its potential transformation from a mere laboratory curiosity to a feasible technology for industrial chemical synthesis.

Greening dryland ecosystems greatly benefits from significant CO2 fertilization. This greening trend across global drylands, however, has also been severely constrained by enhancing atmospheric and soil water (SW) deficits. Thus far, the relative offsets in the contributions between the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), SW at varying depths, and CO2 fertilization to vegetation dynamics, as well as the differences in the impacts of decreasing SW at different soil depths on dryland ecosystems over long periods, remain poorly recorded. Here, this study comprehensively explored the relative offsets in the contributions to vegetation dynamics between high VPD, low SW, and rising CO2 concentration across global drylands during 1982–2018 using process-based models and satellite-observed Leaf Area Index (LAI), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). Results revealed that decreasing-SW-induced reductions of LAI in dryland ecosystems were larger than those caused by rising VPD. Furthermore, dryland vegetation was more severely constrained by decreasing SW on the subsurface (7–28 cm) among various soil layers. Notable offsets were found in the contributions between enhanced water constraints and CO2 fertilization, with the former offsetting approximately 38.49% of the beneficial effects of the latter on vegetation changes in global drylands. Process-based models supported the satellite-observed finding that increasing water constraints failed to overwhelmingly offset significant CO2 fertilization on dryland ecosystems. This work emphasizes the differences in the impact of SW at different soil depths on vegetation dynamics across global drylands as well as highlights the far-reaching importance of significant CO2 fertilization to greening dryland ecosystems despite increasing atmospheric and SW constraints.

Methane CH₄ and carbon dioxide CO₂ are the primary gases produced during anaerobic digestion AD, followed by what is referred to as “other gases,” a highly variable group depending on the type of organic matter being digested. However, one of the most notable and common gases is hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), a gas that, while not a greenhouse gas, is well-known for its corrosive effects and its impact on health and the environment [1]. To quantify gas emissions associated with the treatment of horse manure at the Cavalry Canton of the National Army of Colombia, a direct monitoring system was implemented. Over 45 days, measurements of CH₄, CO₂, and H₂S were conducted using sensors such as the MQ-4, TGS 2611, SEN 0219, and MQ-136, respectively. The measurement ranges of the instruments used were: (200 – 10,000 ppm, 500 – 12,500 ppm, 0 – 5000 ppm, and 0 – 200 ppm), with detection levels of: (10 ppm, 0.1 – 0.65 ppm, 40 ppm, 30 ppm). These instruments were placed in three key scenarios: the manure storage site, the biodigester outlet, and under controlled laboratory conditions. The objective was to generate a detailed analysis of the behavior of these emissions. As a result, theoretical estimates of CH₄ and CO₂ equivalents were calculated for the Cavalry Canton. These theoretical estimates were compared with the data obtained from the monitoring and showed reductions ranging from 8 to 87 % for CH₄, 58 to 67 % for CO₂, and 33 to 65 % for H₂S. These figures highlight the effectiveness of the implemented system in detecting gas emissions of interest from horse manure management, significantly contributing to environmental sustainability.

Following the economic shocks of recent decades, characterized by the destabilization of markets and pressure on national economies, protectionist policies have seen a significant increase. Thus, anti-dumping has become a convenient and frequently used tool in the political game of trade. In the context of the transition toward a climate-neutral economy, anti-dumping measures have become a topic of great interest due to their indirect effects on CO2 emissions. Often used to protect domestic industries from unfair trade practices, these measures influence trade and the geographical redistribution of production, contributing to the phenomenon of “carbon leakage”. By transferring emissions from countries with strict climate regulations to economies with more permissive standards, anti-dumping measures can undermine global efforts to reduce emissions. Trade policies are becoming, in this context, an important tool in regulating international trade. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to analyze the impacts of anti-dumping measures, primary energy consumption, and urbanization on CO2 emissions in OECD countries for the period 2000–2021. The methodology used is based on dynamic A.R.D.L. models using panel data. Our results suggest that anti-dumping measures and primary energy consumption influence CO2 emissions and are statistically significant, at least at the 10% level. The results of this study are useful to both policymakers and environmental authorities in developing trade policies that support both economic development and emission-reduction targets.

The overuse of fossil fuels has led to global warming and air pollution due to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2. The toxic effects of coal combustion can be reduced by mixing coal with biomass, which is called the co-firing method. This study aims to analyze the use of co-firing using various types of biomass based on previous studies. The results show that different biomass blending ratios affect the emission reduction significantly. Mixing palm kernel shell biomass at a ratio of 10% biomass and 90% coal reduced emissions by 20%, while mixing mesua ferrea tree biomass and sawdust at a ratio of 75% coal and 25% biomass reduced emissions by 45%. The use of empty fruit bunch biomass at a ratio of 30% biomass and 70% coal can reduce CO2 emissions by 72.14%. Overall, co-firing proved effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the transition to renewable energy, although its effectiveness depends on the type of biomass and the blending ratio.

Abstract. The CO2–carbonate system dynamics in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (NASPG) were evaluated between 2009 and 2019. Data were collected aboard eight summer cruises through the Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR) 59.5° N section. The ocean acidification (OA) patterns and the reduction in the saturation state of calcite (ΩCa) and aragonite (ΩArag) in response to the increasing anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) were assessed within the Irminger, Iceland, and Rockall basins during a poorly assessed decade in which the physical patterns reversed in comparison with previous well-known periods. The observed cooling, freshening, and enhanced ventilation increased the interannual rate of accumulation of Cant in the interior ocean by 50 %–86 % and the OA rates by close to 10 %. The OA trends were 0.0013–0.0032 units yr−1 in the Irminger and Iceland basins and 0.0006–0.0024 units yr−1 in the Rockall Trough, causing a decline in ΩCa and ΩArag of 0.004–0.021 and 0.003–0.0013 units yr−1, respectively. The Cant-driven rise in total inorganic carbon (CT) was the main driver of the OA (contributed by 53 %–68 % in upper layers and > 82 % toward the interior ocean) and the reduction in ΩCa and ΩArag (> 64 %). The transient decrease in temperature, salinity, and AT collectively counteracts the CT-driven acidification by 45 %–85 % in the upper layers and in the shallow Rockall Trough and by < 10 % in the interior ocean. The present investigation reports the acceleration of the OA within the NASPG and expands knowledge about the future state of the ocean.

With the increasing need to tackle climate change, energy efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions are proving to be one of society’s greatest challenges. Special consideration should be given to heating systems as they are prone to inefficiency due to non-optimal controller configurations and the shortage of experts or qualified technicians to optimize the operating behavior. Especially for residential heating systems, more often than not, the target metric is the achievement of specific heating and hot water temperatures by manual adjustments with limited sensor information and with little regard to efficiency. This presents potential for computer-aided optimization based on artificial intelligence techniques. In this paper, we presented a Decision Integration System that is interfaced with a data acquisition infrastructure and allows for the analysis of measured heating system data, the generation of recommended measures for efficiency improvement, and the simulative validation of recommended controller parameter changes. We presented different parts of the Decision Integration System, the interfaced data acquisition infrastructure, as well as the non-invasive sensor appliances used. We analyzed the measured data of real heating systems and evaluated our approach by generating the recommended measures based on rules created by heating system experts, which were then partially applied to the physical heating systems and partially evaluated in simulation. Finally, we compared long-term energy consumption data against the latest monitoring period after implementing the measures. Our results showed an average reduction in energy consumption of 24.52% across all considered buildings, corresponding to an approximate reduction of 8.12 tons of CO2 emissions.

Underground research laboratories (URLs) provide a window on the deep biosphere and enable investigation of potential microbial impacts on nuclear waste, CO2 and H2 stored in the subsurface. We carried out the first multi-year study of groundwater microbiomes sampled from defined intervals between 140 and 400 m below the surface of the Horonobe and Mizunami URLs, Japan. We reconstructed draft genomes for > 90% of all organisms detected over a four year period. The Horonobe and Mizunami microbiomes are dissimilar, likely because the Mizunami URL is hosted in granitic rock and the Horonobe URL in sedimentary rock. Despite this, hydrogen metabolism, rubisco-based CO2 fixation, reduction of nitrogen compounds and sulfate reduction are well represented functions in microbiomes from both URLs, although methane metabolism is more prevalent at the organic- and CO2-rich Horonobe URL. High fluid flow zones and proximity to subsurface tunnels select for candidate phyla radiation bacteria in the Mizunami URL. We detected near-identical genotypes for approximately one third of all genomically defined organisms at multiple depths within the Horonobe URL. This cannot be explained by inactivity, as in situ growth was detected for some bacteria, albeit at slow rates. Given the current low hydraulic conductivity and groundwater compositional heterogeneity, ongoing inter-site strain dispersal seems unlikely. Alternatively, the Horonobe URL microbiome homogeneity may be explained by higher groundwater mobility during the last glacial period. Genotypically-defined species closely related to those detected in the URLs were identified in three other subsurface environments in the USA. Thus, dispersal rates between widely separated underground sites may be fast enough relative to mutation rates to have precluded substantial divergence in species composition. Species overlaps between subsurface locations on different continents constrain expectations regarding the scale of global subsurface biodiversity. Our analyses reveal microbiome stability in the sedimentary rocks and surprising microbial community compositional and genotypic overlap over sites separated by hundreds of meters of rock, potentially explained by dispersal via slow groundwater flow or during a prior hydrological regime. Overall, microbiome and geochemical stability over the study period has important implications for underground storage applications.

ConspectusElectrochemistry has been used as a tool to drive chemical reactions for more than two centuries. With the help of an electrode and a power source, chemists are provided with a system whose potential can be precisely dialed in. The theoretically infinite redox range renders electrochemistry capable of oxidizing or reducing some of the most tenacious compounds. Indeed, electroreduction offers an alternative to generating highly active intermediates from electrophiles (e.g., halides, alkenes, etc.) in organic synthesis, which can be untouchable with traditional reduction methods. Meanwhile, the reductive coupling reactions are extensively utilized in both industrial and academic settings due to their ability to swiftly, accurately, and effectively construct C–C and C–X bonds, which present innovative approaches for synthesizing complex molecules. Nonetheless, its application is constrained by several inherent limitations: (a) the requirement for stoichiometric quantities of reducing agents, (b) scarce activation strategies for inert substrates with high reduction potentials, (c) incomplete mechanistic elucidation, and (d) challenges in the isolation of intermediates. The merging of electrochemistry and reductive coupling represents an attractive approach to address the above limitations in organic synthesis and has seen increasing use in the synthetic community over the past few years.Since 2020, our group has been dedicated to developing electroreductive cross-coupling reactions using readily available organic substrates with small molecules, such as organic halides, alkenes, arenes, CO2, and D2O, to construct high value-added organic products. Electroreductive chemistry is highly versatile and offers powerful reducing capacity and precise selectivity control, which has allowed us to develop three electrochemical modes in our lab: (1) An economically advantageous electrochemical direct reduction (EDR) strategy that emphasizes efficiency, achieves high atom utilization, and minimizes unnecessary atomic waste. (2) A class of electrochemical organo-mediated reduction (EOMR) methods that are capable of effectively controlling reaction intermediates and reaction pathways. This allows for precise modulation of reaction processes to enhance efficiency and selectivity. (3) The electrochemical metal-catalyzed reduction (EMCR) method that enables selective activation and functionalization of specific chemical bonds or functional groups under mild conditions, thereby reducing the occurrence of side reactions. We commenced our studies by establishing an organic-mediator-promoted electroreductive carboxylation of aryl and alkyl halides. This strategy was then employed for the arylcarboxylation of simple styrenes with aryl halides in a highly selective manner. Meanwhile, under direct electrolysis conditions, the carboxylation of arenes and epoxides with CO2 as the carboxyl source was achieved. Moreover, through the precise adjustment of the electroreductive conditions, we successfully accomplished the electroreductive deuteration of arenes, olefins, and unactivated alkyl halides, enabling the efficient and selective formation of D-labeled products. Finally, building on our previous understanding of alkyl halides, we developed a series of electrochemical alkylation reactions that enable the efficient formation of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds using alkyl halides.

Abstract Electrocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and nitrate holds immense promise as a sustainable strategy, but its complicated synthesis steps and controversial C–N coupling mechanism restrict the design of efficient catalysts. Atomically precise metal cluster materials are ideal model catalysts for investigating the C–N coupling issues. Here we synthesize two atomically precise bimetallic clusters, Ag14Pd(PTFE)6(TPP)8 and Ag13Au5(PTFE)10(DPPP)4, both with icosahedral cores and similar ligands. We demonstrate that both clusters have good performance for electrocatalytic urea synthesis, with the production rates at the maximum Faradaic efficiency being 143.3 and 82.3 mg h−1 gcat−1, respectively. Bimetallic structures can induce charge polarization at the active sites of metal clusters, thereby influencing the selectivity. In mechanistic investigations, we propose that *NOH and *COOH are the rate-limiting steps for the reduction of nitrate and CO2, respectively, and that the key intermediates formed thereafter can significantly affect the C–N coupling process. This approach offers a deep understanding into the C–N coupling through the utilization of atomically precise metal clusters.

Background/Objectives: Rhinophyma, an advanced form of rosacea, is characterized by significant nasal tissue enlargement and deformation, leading to aesthetic and psychosocial challenges. Traditional treatments are often invasive with variable outcomes, emphasizing the need for improved therapeutic approaches. This study evaluates the efficacy of a dual-laser therapy (CO2 and dye lasers) in treating rhinophyma. An innovative diagnostic algorithm using multispectral imaging guided treatment decisions, while Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was utilized to analyze post-treatment vascular and collagen changes. Methods: A prospective study was conducted involving 20 patients with rhinophyma. Multispectral imaging was used to guide the tailored application of CO2 laser, dye laser, or both, depending on the predominant vascular or glandular components in the nasal tissue. Post-treatment analysis employed OCT to assess changes in vascular and collagen density, providing insights into the tissue modifications induced by laser therapy. Results: The treatment significantly reduced vascular density from 35,526.75 to 26,577.55 at 300 microns and from 46,916.25 to 35,509.25 at 500 microns. Collagen density decreased from 81.35 to 66.34. All reductions were statistically significant, with highly significant p-values. These findings highlight the dual-laser therapy’s effectiveness in addressing the pathological features of rhinophyma. Conclusions: Dual-laser therapy guided by multispectral imaging provides a targeted and effective treatment for rhinophyma, addressing its vascular and glandular components. The use of OCT enhances understanding of laser-induced tissue changes and confirms significant reductions in vascular and collagen density. This approach represents a significant advancement in the management of rhinophyma, offering improved precision and therapeutic outcomes.

Polydispersed Ag species-modified TiO2 samples with abundant oxygen vacancies were successfully prepared through the calcination of atomically precise Ag33 nanocluster-loaded TiO2 at an optimal temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ligands of the Ag33 nanoclusters are removed by extracting lattice oxygen from TiO2 during the calcination, leading to the formation of CO2, SO2, and H2O vapor. This process simultaneously induces Ag species sintering on the surface of TiO2. The resulting nanocomposites exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of nitroarenes with NaBH4 as the reductant. This is attributed to the produced Ag species on the oxygen-deficient TiO2, which act as active centers for the catalytic process.

This study explores energy consumption, thermal performance, and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in terminal buildings. Through detailed thermal analysis, this research identifies key sources of heat loss, such as thermal bridges in walls and windows, which significantly increase energy demands for heating. IEQ measurements show that the lack of mechanical ventilation, combined with high passenger densities, frequently leads to CO2 levels exceeding recommended thresholds, highlighting the urgent need for improved ventilation systems. Energy requirements were calculated based on the TS 825 standard and compared to actual consumption data, showing that optimizing boiler settings could save 22% of heating energy without any additional investment. Simulations and economic analyses further showed that adding thermal insulation to the building envelope and installing double-glazed windows with improved U-values could achieve significant energy savings and reduce CO2 emissions, all with favorable payback periods. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental impact of these interventions, demonstrating significant reductions in the airport’s carbon footprint. The findings underscore the importance of aligning operational standards with international guidelines, such as ASHRAE and CIBSE, to ensure thermal comfort and optimize energy use.

Development of fuel electrodes for reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs) is important for achieving good performance and stability under both solid oxide fuel cell and electrolysis cell operation modes. In this work, CeO2-decorated La0.43Ca0.37Ti0.94Ni0.06O3−δ (denoted as LCTN-Ce) fuel electrodes were prepared via a simple hydrothermal route, where CeO2 is uniformly decorated onto the external surface of the LCTN-Ce electrode with in situ exsolved Ni nanoparticles (NPs) after reduction treatment. The decorated CeO2 content can be regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal treatment time and precursor solution concentration. As the decorated CeO2 content increases from 0.81 to 2.05%, the conductivity of the LCTN-Ce electrode decreases while the oxygen vacancy concentration increases, comprehensively affecting the cell power output and CO2 electrolysis activity. The electrolyte-supported cell assembled with LCTN-1.46Ce cell with a moderate CeO2 content of 1.46% shows an excellent reversible electrochemical performance and RSOC stability in 50% H2/50% CO2 at 750 °C. The hydrothermal decoration provides a facile way to modify perovskite oxides, and the LCTN-Ce with in situ exsolved Ni NPs and surface-decorated CeO2 is proved to be a potential RSOC fuel electrode material.

None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.70135/seejph.vi.2660.
    
Background:Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to acne is a common undesirable sequela following acne that leads to psychological distress and a sense of incomplete treatment among the patients with acne. Few studies have been done in regard to address this condition, and no definite treatment or clear ranking of treatment modalities is available as of yet.Aims:The aim of our study was to assess and compare the efficacy and safety of 1,064-nm Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (QSNY) laser with 10% azelaic acid versus Fractional carbon dioxide (FCO2) laser with 10% azelaic acid in the treatment of post acne pigmentation.Materials and Methods:Seventy patients with PIH secondary to acne were recruited in this study. The patients were randomized into two groups, Group A and Group B, of thirty-five patients each. Patients in group A underwent QSNY laser, while Group B received FCO2 laser. 10% azelaic acid cream was administered to both groups. Both groups received a total of 5 treatment sessions, with 3 weeks interval between each setting. The efficacy and safety of both modalities were assessed using the quartile grading score(QGS), post acne hyperpigmentationindex(PAHPI), patient satisfaction score, and documentation of adverse effects.Results:At the end of five sessions, significant improvement in QGS, PAHPI and patient satisfaction (P < 0.001, respectively) was seen in both groups. The mean PAHPI significantly reduced after the third setting and was followed by drastic reduction in the following settings. However, significantly superior results were noted in Group A with respect to all assessments. Side effects noted were mild and transient, except two patients of Group B who developed further pigmentation over the treatment areas.Conclusion:This study shows that both QSNY laser and FCO2 laser can be used to treat post-acne pigmentation; however, QSNY laser should be preferred with respect to efficacy and safety, especially in the Indian population, owing to the higher risk of pigmentation following FCO2 laser.

The paper presents aspects related the influence of the global gases emissions reduction targets on the design and performances of a propulsion system for a bulk carrier. In a first stage, the key elements of the ship propulsion system: main engine and propeller have been chosen and designed. The aim was to obtain the maximum propulsive efficiency at the owner desired speed. Different combinations: diesel engine-optimal propeller have been designed and analysed from the efficiency point of view. In a second stage, considering the mandatory IMO regulations concerning CO2 emissions, the EEDI (Energy Efficiency De sign Index) has been computed for every designed case. To compliance EEDI targets, it was been necessary to reduce the ship speed, and a new propulsion system with lower speed performances has been designed. In this study, ship hull shapes were given and EEDI be came an important and critical factor in the design of the ship propulsion system. Other potential pathways to achieve emissions reduction targets will need to be identify in a future study.

It is known that metakaolin powder has proved to be a promising alternative concrete binder to Ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Portland cement production contributes about 8% to the global CO2 emission, which is detrimental to the environment and a major contributor to global warming. It is therefore pertinent to develop alternative costeffective and environmentally friendly cement materials. This study examines the performance of a Nigerian metakaolin-based powder as a sustainable material alternative to Portland cement. The Gwaram-Alkaleri Kaolin clay from Bauchi State, Nigeria, was calcined at 800°C for 3 hours as step prior to metakaolin formation. The powder specimens were characterized using XRF, moisture content, specific gravity, density, particle size distribution analysis and specific surface area techniques. Parametric analyses of the values of the specific gravity, density, particle size distribution and specific surface area were undertaken and comparisons and deductions made. The results revealed that Gwaram-Alkaleri metakaolin-powder can serve as a potential sustainable construction material for the Nigerian construction industry because of its availability, affordability, physical and chemical properties values, and significant reduction in CO2 emission, taking cognizance that the results positively indicate that it can be used as an alternative binding powder to cement in concrete and mortar production.

China's carbon reduction and emission reduction under the 'double carbon' target requires high-precision atmospheric CO2 inversion data. High-precision atmospheric CO2 satellite observation is the basis for accurate positioning of emission sources. Aiming at the problem that the inversion algorithm is difficult to converge in the existing inversion methods, a statistical method integrating multi-source information is explored to obtain accurate prior profiles. It provides relatively accurate initial values for subsequent high-precision CO2 inversion algorithms in order to improve the accuracy of CO2 inversion. The statistical inversion method establishes a regression relationship model between satellite spectrum and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the inversion accuracy is affected by the representativeness of the sample and the regression analysis method. According to the difference of regional characteristics, the CO2 profile samples are counted, and the sensitivity of environmental parameters is analyzed to construct a representative sample set. It is verified that the profile obtained by inversion is very close to the real profile, which verifies the feasibility of the method.

To estimate the potential and realized carbon emission reductions from implementation of reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Indonesia, we compiled logging emissions data from 15 concessions in Kalimantan and 10 from the Papuan provinces. Committed emissions data were collected for harvested timber as well as from collateral damage caused by felling, skidding, and clearing for haul roads and log yards. Emissions expressed as mean ± standard error per cubic meter of timber harvested, per area harvested, and per Mg of timber harvested (i.e., the ‘Carbon Impact Factor’) were 1.30 ± 0.15 Mg C m−3, 27.52 ± 4.44 Mg C ha−1, and 6.88 ± 0.84 Mg Mg−1, respectively. Among the sampled concessions, felling, hauling, and skidding caused 18–86%, 2–48%, and 6–75% of these emissions, respectively. Potential emission reductions calculated as the difference between observed emissions and those of the five best-performing concessions are 0.67 ± 0.15 Mg C m−3, 21.11 ± 4.38 Mg C ha−1, and 4.20 ± 0.83 Mg Mg−1, which represents reductions of 51%, 76%, and 61%, respectively. Extrapolating these estimates to all of Indonesia using average log production data from 2018 to 2021 results in an estimated annual emissions reduction of 14.47 Tg CO2 from full adoption of RIL, which is 2.9% of Indonesia’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) from the forestry sector.

Controlling the redox ability is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in clean energy, environmental protection, and CO2 reduction, as it directly influences the reaction efficiency and electron transfer rates, driving sustainable and effective outcomes. Here, we report the plasma‐electrified synthesis of composition‐controlled FeAu bimetallic nanoparticles, specifically engineered to enhance the redox catalytic performance through precise tuning of their chemical states. Utilizing atmospheric‐pressure microplasmas, FeAu nanoparticles were synthesized under ambient conditions without the need for reducing agents or organic solvents, thereby providing a green and sustainable approach. The catalytic activity of the FeAu nanoparticles was significantly influenced by the oxidation states of Au modulated by adjusting the process. This precise tuning directly affects the oxidation‐reduction potential (ORP) of the nanoparticles, driving their superior degradation performance. The FeAu‐1.52 sample exhibited the highest normalized rate constant (k=46.3 s‐1 g‐1), attributed to an optimal Au+/Au0 ratio that facilitates efficient electron transfer and redox cycling during the catalytic reduction of 4‐NP to 4‐aminophenol (4‐AP). Beyond 4‐NP, the FeAu nanoparticles demonstrated robust catalytic degradation of multiple dye pollutants for industrial wastewater treatment. This study elucidates the critical role of chemical state tuning in determining redox performance and presents a promising nanotechnology platform for sustainable environmental remediation.

Malaysia has restricted the use of biodiesel blends to B7 in the highlands due to challenges related to cold flow operability, while B10 and B20 are used in the lowlands. This study evaluated the performance and emissions of a light-duty, 4-cylinder Euro III turbocharged common rail direct injection diesel vehicle using palm biodiesel blends (B10, B20, and B30) at speeds of 60, 80, and 100 km/h under simulated cold temperatures of 10, 15, and 20°C in a controlled cold chamber. The combustion of B10 and B20 in the diesel engine showed enhancements in power and torque of 3.9% and 4.6%, respectively, compared to Euro 2M (B7) diesel. These improvements are likely the result of the synergistic effects of the enriched oxygen levels in biodiesel and the increased density of cold air, which enhance combustion efficiency. CO2 emissions decreased by 1.5%, 4.3%, and 11.2% with the use of B10, B20, and B30 fuels, respectively. NOx emissions decreased as biodiesel content increased at 10 and 15°C; however, the emissions increased by 17.6% and 38.2% for B20 and B30, respectively, in comparison to B10 at 20°C. B20 demonstrated good engine performance and emissions at 15°C, with improvements of 1.3% in power and 3.7% in torque, which compensated for a 3.2% increase in fuel consumption, and there were reductions of 8.9% in NOx emissions and 0.9% in CO2 emissions compared to B7 diesel. Palm biodiesel blends ranging from 7 wt.% to 20 wt.% are capable of withstanding the moderate cold ambient temperatures of the highlands without compromising engine operation.

Platinum is widely used as a reduction promoter in transition metal heterogeneous catalysts, while its effects on the catalyst’s properties and CO hydrogenation behavior remain unclear. In this study, an improvement in the reducibility of platinum-promoted catalysts is observed. Notably, platinum suppresses the aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles (CoNPs) during catalyst preparation, as evidenced by STEM/TEM and XRD analyses, which reveal the presence of smaller CoNPs and weakened cobalt diffraction in platinum-promoted catalysts. In addition, platinum also promotes the formation of more active hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cobalt but inhibits metal-support interaction (MSI). Therefore, the cobalt-time yield (CTY) for CO hydrogenation in the promoted catalyst is strongly improved, and, furthermore, its intrinsic activity (turnover frequency, TOF) is also slightly increased. However, the product distribution seems unchanged except for the CO2 for the platinum-promoted catalysts.

This study investigates the adoption of recycled PET BubbleDeck slabs in Oman, focusing on sustainability, economic feasibility, social perceptions, and regulatory support. Using a questionnaire-based survey analysed through SPSS, the research explores key determinants, including carbon footprint reduction, material efficiency, life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), public awareness, and policy frameworks, with stakeholder awareness mediating the relationships. Results demonstrate that BubbleDeck slabs reduce CO2 emissions by 33% and concrete usage by 25%, aligning with Oman Vision 2040’s emphasis on sustainable construction. However, high initial costs and limited public awareness hinder adoption. The study’s regression analysis highlights that sustainability metrics and regulatory support are significant predictors of adoption, with carbon footprint reduction and certifications playing critical roles. Economic feasibility, particularly LCCA, positively impacts adoption, while initial costs present barriers. Public awareness and trust in technology emerged as essential social factors driving acceptance. This research underscores the importance of policy-driven incentives, public education campaigns, and stakeholder collaboration in promoting innovative green technologies. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to advance sustainable urban development and foster the widespread adoption of BubbleDeck technology in the construction sector.

With the increasing global attention to environmental issues and climate change, power companies, as an important energy production sector, are facing severe challenges in reducing pollution and carbon emissions. In view of this, this study is based on the metal organic framework MIL-101(Cr), physically encapsulating metalloporphyrins and synthesizing a FeTPP@MIL-101(Cr) complex. Then, the surface characteristics and adsorption performance of the composite are evaluated, and the pressure swing physical adsorption method is introduced to achieve the goal of carbon reduction and pollution reduction. The ICP-OES loading results showed that the corresponding encapsulation amounts in MIL@-A and MIL@-B composites were 5.24% and 3.20%, respectively. Moreover, when the temperature increased from 273 K to 298 K, the adsorption capacity of all test gases on the three samples showed a decreasing trend. Under ideal atmospheric pressure conditions, the adsorption capacity of MIL@-A encapsulation for CO2 did not decrease and increased, while the adsorption capacity for N2 was relatively small, but still had a certain adsorption capacity. The above results indicate that combining the pressure swing physical adsorption method with FeTPP@MIL-101(Cr) complexes can effectively adsorb pollutants generated by power enterprises, achieve predetermined goals, and help promote clean production in power enterprises.

In this paper, we investigate traffic bottlenecks, a primary cause of congestion that significantly impacts the overall efficiency of traffic networks. To address this challenge, a multi-segment variable speed limit control strategy is proposed to mitigate moving bottlenecks, particularly those on super-long-span bridges. First, an extended macro-traffic flow model, built upon the classic MetaNet framework, is proposed as a state-space model to capture the critical characteristics of long segments, which is a key contribution of this paper. Next, a fast prediction model is developed to forecast traffic flow states in lane-drop bottlenecks with restricted passing capacity over long road segments. Then, a controller leveraging the state-compensation flow model is designed to regulate the future evolution of bottleneck density. Finally, the multi-segment variable speed predictive control (MVSPC) strategy is validated on a simulation platform integrating PYTHON and SUMO, and its performance is compared with both traditional and advanced methods. The results demonstrate that under varying traffic flow levels, particularly in high-demand scenarios, the strategy achieves significant improvements in efficiency, safety, and environmental metrics. These include a 62.44% reduction in waiting time, a 95.32% decrease in potential collisions, and reductions in emissions: 26.4% in CO2, 14.11% in CO, 26.53% in NO, and 32.90% in NOX. The proposed strategy is particularly effective for long segments, such as super-long-span bridges.

Abstract This paper investigates a novel methodology for measuring greenhouse gas emissions by re-evaluating the packaging and transport systems of local communities at a time when concerns about environmental sustainability and the fight against climate change are increasingly heightened. The research first presents CO2 emissions data associated with each logistical sub-process and the methodology used to calculate the CO2 emissions associated with the products. Then, the analysis of a local community-owned asset exchange is presented. Based on the packaging size and weight of the items, calculations are made of the CO2 impact of transporting a product from different distances. The results are also analyzed by investigating the activity of the local community with four different modes of transport and then comparing the amount of CO2 emitted to the population of a city. The study demonstrates that freight transport operations are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions and seeks to identify opportunities that could lead to significant carbon footprint reductions through community initiatives. The paper points out that even a local community exchange of goods could make a significant contribution to reducing global CO2 emissions. Therefore, in addition to measures to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, implementing a "Think globally, act locally" policy would contribute significantly to CO2 emissions reductions.

Recent advancements in reconstructive techniques for burn-induced skin defects have improved functional and aesthetic outcomes to enhance life quality of burn survivors. A wide range of innovative methods such as flap surgeries advancements or laser therapies and tissue expansion techniques are now available in the markets and their use has been widely explored for management of extensive post-burn scarring. According to studies the use of latest technological innovations and microvascular free tissue transfer, Z-plasty and trapeze flaps have excellent success rates for contracture release, scar reduction, and functional restoration. Laser treatments that have shown promise in decreasing scar thickness and increasing suppleness include stromal vascular fraction therapy and CO2 fractional lasers. There remain persisting issues like limited long-term data, expense, and technical complexity. In order to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, drawbacks, and potential future directions of these reconstructive techniques in burn care, this review summarizes recent research.

The effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies for the remediation of soils contaminated with heavy hydrocarbons has been extensively documented in the scientific literature. In general, high-concentration crude-oil-contaminated soil is treated with high-temperature thermal desorption (HTTD) in order to achieve high remediation efficiency. However, this process has the unintended consequence of destroying soil fertility. Low-temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) represents an alternative approach that has been developed with the objective of remediating heavily crude-oil-contaminated soil in a more rapid and cost-effective manner while simultaneously enhancing soil fertility. The thermal desorption unit (TDU) was employed using both LTTD and HTTD, operating at 300 °C and 500 °C, respectively, with a 30 min residence time in the kiln. The concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in both the LTTD- and HTTD-treated soils was found to be less than 1% by weight, thereby below regulatory standards. The environmental impacts of both processes were assessed using the OpenLCA software version 2.0. The HTTD process exhibited a total abiotic depletion potential (ADP) impact of 1.63 × 10−4 MJ and a global warming potential (GWP) of 414 kg CO2-eq. In contrast, LTTD demonstrated lower impacts, with an ADP of 1.29 × 10−4 MJ and a GWP of 278 kg CO2-eq. The transition from HTTD to LTTD resulted in a notable reduction in ADP by 20.5% and in GWP by 32.9%. The application of LTTD-treated soil coated with coke or carbonized residues has been demonstrated to serve as an effective soil amendment, with the capacity to sequester approximately 50% of organic hydrocarbon contaminants. The results of this study illustrate the potential of LTTD for not only economical and rapid soil remediation but also the enhancement of soil quality through beneficial reuse.

The electrocatalytic reaction pathway is highly dependent on the intrinsic structure of the catalyst. CO2/CO electroreduction has recently emerged as a potential approach for obtaining C2+ products, but it is challenging to achieve high selectivity for a single C2+ product. Herein, we develop a Cu atomic ensemble that satisfies the appropriate site distance and coordination environment required for electrocatalytic CO-to-acetate conversion, which shows outstanding overall performance with an acetate Faradaic efficiency of 70.2% with a partial current density of 225 mA cm–2 and a formation rate of 2.1 mmol h–1 cm–2. Moreover, a single-pass CO conversion rate of 91% and remarkable stability can be also obtained. Detailed experimental and theoretical investigations confirm the significant advantages of the Cu atomic ensembles in optimizing C–C coupling, stabilizing key ketene intermediate (*CCO), and inhibiting the *HOCCOH intermediate, which can switch the CO reduction pathway from the ethanol/ethylene on the conventional metallic Cu site to the acetate on the Cu atomic ensembles.

Abstract The Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool for Global Cities (ITHIM-Global) was developed as an open-source tool to assess the impacts of transport mode shifts on public health and the environment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the need for such assessment is urgent and rising. The model simulates the impacts on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost outcomes through a multi-pathway framework, specifically including physical activity, air pollution exposure, and road traffic fatalities. In addition, the model estimates changes in carbon dioxide emissions resulting from these mode shifts. ITHIM-Global employs a quasi-microsimulation approach that enables individualized exposure estimates by age, sex, and activity levels and utilises up- to-date exposure and dose-response functions that account for the non-linear relationship between physical activity levels and health. To demonstrate its functionality, document its strengths and weaknesses, and aid users, the model was applied to Bogota, Colombia, using three hypothetical scenarios, each shifting 5% of trips to one of bus, car, or cycling. Results indicate that increasing public or active transport modes enhances public health, primarily driven by gains in physical activity and to a lesser extent by reductions in traffic-related emissions. Conversely, a shift to car usage worsens health outcomes due to decreased physical activity and increased pollution exposure. ITHIM-Global serves as a flexible, detailed Health Impact Assessment (HIA) tool adaptable to urban areas across LMICs and this article delves into underlying assumptions and their influence to advance generalisable lessons on risk assessment and model development. The modular structure of ITHIM-Global, its covering of individual and population-level analyses, and extensive documentation provide an accessible, evidence-based approach for city planners and practitioners to optimize transport policies that support public health and mitigate environmental harm. Graphical Abstract Highlights We describe the Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool for Global cities (ITHIM- Global), designed for low- and middle-income country (LMIC) cities. We apply ITHIM-Global to Bogotá, simulating impacts from three mode shift scenarios with a 5- percentage point increase in car, cycling, and bus shares. We simulate the impacts on physical activity, air pollution, road traffic fatalities, and attributable mortalities and years of life lost. We describe in detail the model’s elements to aid future uptake, development, and extension to other cities. We discuss strengths, weaknesses, and underlying assumptions to advance generalisable lessons on risk assessment and model development.

Abstract A research has been undertaken to investigate the possibility of producing sustainable lightweight geopolymer material by using waste zeolite (zeolite molecular sieve) as aluminates and silicates source and at the same time as lightweight medium. This was done by totally or partially replacement of fly ash by waste zeolite particles. Six geopolymer mixes were designed and produced using different source materials (fly ash F, fly ash C and zeolite) and alkaline solution of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide. From the results, it was found that using fly ash C resulted in producing geopolymer mix with higher density than those made with fly ash F (Gf mix). However, replacing the fly ash totally with the zeolite particles helped in producing lightweight geopolymer concrete (1600 kg/m 3 ) by achieving about 27% weight reduction and gaining about 5.1 MPa compressive strength. Not only reducing CO2 emissions by adopting zeolite- based geopolymer binder (instead of cement paste) but also achieving operational energy saving by producing lightweight concrete was obtained from producing lightweight geopolymer concrete as constructional material.

Quantum computing (QC) provides a promising avenue toward enabling quantum chemistry calculations, which are classically impossible due to a computational complexity that increases exponentially with system size. As fully fault-tolerant algorithms and hardware, for which an exponential speedup is predicted, are currently out of reach, recent research efforts are dedicated to developing and scaling algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to showcase the practical utility of such machines. To demonstrate the utility of NISQ devices in the field of chemistry, we apply our recently developed FAST-VQE algorithm and a novel quantum gate reduction strategy based on propositional satisfiability together with standard optimization tools for the simulation of the rate-determining proton transfer step for CO2 hydration catalysed by carbonic anhydrase resulting in the first application of a quantum computing device for the simulation of an enzymatic reaction. To this end, we have combined classical force field simulations with quantum mechanical methods on classical and quantum computers in a hybrid calculation approach. The presented technique significantly enhances the accuracy and capabilities of QC-based molecular modeling and finally pushes it into compelling and realistic applications. The framework is general and can be applied beyond the case of computational enzymology.

Enhancing the flame retardancy of biobased rigid polyurethane foams is a crucial step towards improving the sustainability of the polyurethane industry. In this work, we systematically analyzed the effect of increasing the isocyanate index (NCOindex) and the flame retardant content using a polyol with high renewable content (&gt;97 wt.%). We found outstanding results regarding the CO(g)/CO2(g) index, the most important safety parameter in terms of human safety, whereas a significant reduction of 78% and 69.6 % was observed as a function of increasing the NCOindex and flame retardant (FR) content, respectively. In addition, the FR did not cause an increase of the total smoke produced (TSP), on the contrary, it decreased up to 31.4% after increasing the FR concentration. The MAHRE parameter was also substantially improved, up to 40.6%, indicating the formation of a thicker char layer which protected the foam during burning. This was achieved simultaneously with outstanding improvements of the specific compressive strength of up to +155%. The studies were substantiated by a comprehensive physico-chemical characterization using TGA analysis, water absorption, initial thermal conductivity, FTIR analysis and cell geometry using SEM. These results are of paramount importance to promote the use of biobased rigid polyurethane foams with enhanced fire retardancy.

Aims Arthroplasty has been shown to generate the most waste among all orthopaedic subspecialties, and it is estimated that hip and knee arthroplasty generate in excess of three million kg of waste annually in the UK. Infectious waste generates up to ten times more CO2 compared with recycled waste, and previous studies have shown that over 90% of waste in the infectious stream is misallocated. We assessed the effect of real-time waste segregation by an unscrubbed team member on waste generation in knee and hip arthroplasty cases, and compared this with a simple educational intervention during the ‘team brief’ at the start of the operating list across two sites. Methods Waste was categorized into five categories: infectious, general, recycling, sharps, and linens. Each category was weighed at the end of each case using a digital weighing scale. At Site A (a tertiary orthopaedic hospital), pre-intervention data were collected for 16 total knee arthroplasy (TKA) and 15 total hip arthroplasty (THA) cases. Subsequently, for ten TKA and ten THA cases, an unscrubbed team member actively segregated waste in real-time into the correct streams. At Site B (a district general hospital), both pre- and post-intervention groups included ten TKA and ten THA cases. The intervention included reminding staff during the ‘team brief’ to segregate waste correctly. Results Active real-time waste segregation reduced infectious waste by a mean of 2.51 kg (95% CI 1.492 to 3.542) in TKA, and 1.83 kg in THA cases (p = 0.004). Educational intervention reduced infectious waste by a mean of 3.52 kg in TKA and 2.09 kg in THA cases (p = 0.026). Total waste was significantly reduced in both groups post-intervention for TKA cases. Conclusion Simple educational measures alone can significantly reduce the amount of infectious waste. Extrapolated nationally, our results would yield a reduction of approximately 315,004 kg to 594,577 kg of CO2 annually, which equates to 70 to 132 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for a year.

Summary This study initiates a series of tests to examine the application of Type IL cement for well-cementing operations. Type IL cement is a blend of 5–15% limestone with Type I/II Portland cement. This substitution by reducing the amount of CO2 emitted from cement plants can be aligned with sustainability efforts in the cement industry. We first measured the properties of cement slurry made of Type IL cement and compared them with specifications for the well cementing. The properties of hardened cement including the compressive strength and bonding strength were also examined. For compressive strength measurement, both cubic and cylindrical samples were prepared. To measure the bonding strength, the modified pushout test was used. We also investigated the effect of severe environments on the strength reduction of the hardened cement. In addition, the scaled abandonment plugging setup was used to quantify the sealing capabilities of Type IL cement in a well-plugging scenario. To force nitrogen flow through, differential pressure was applied to the system by decreasing the pressure above the plug-in controlled timesteps. We found that Type IL hardened cement offers substantial sealing capabilities compared with data available in the literature, although the leakage rate seems to gradually increase with each increase in differential pressure.

This study investigated the electro-mineralization of chloroquine (CQ) in a filter-press-type flow reactor using two BDD electrodes operating in batch recirculation mode. The optimal operating parameters were established using response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite rotatable design (CCRD) with three parameters: current density (j), initial pH (pH0), and volumetric flow rate (Q), with the mineralization efficiency of (CQ) and specific energy consumption (SEC) as responses. Optimal operating parameters were j = 155.0 mA/cm2, pH0 = 9.75, and Q = 0.84 L/min within a reaction time of 9 h, leading to a maximum mineralization efficiency of CQ of 52.59% and a specific energy consumption of 15.73 kW/mg TOC, with a total operating cost of USD 0.18 per liter. Additionally, an ultra-high-performance chromatography study identified three by-products (4-amino-7-choloroquinoline, formic acid, and acid acetic) of CQ degradation. Furthermore, the phytotoxicity test indicates that the electrochemical wastewater proposed decreased the effluent’s phytotoxicity, and an increase in the percentage of Vigna radiata germination was observed. The carbon footprint of optimized electrochemical mineralization of chloroquine is 2.48 kg CO2 eq., representing a 48% reduction in cumulative energy demand (CED) when the source of energy is a mixture of fossil fuels (50%), wind (25%), and photovoltaic (25%) energy.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in organic carbon (OC) certification of soil as an incentive for farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices. In this context, this pilot project combines geochemical and geophysical methods to map the distribution of OC contents in agricultural fields, allowing us to detect variations in time and space. Here we demonstrated a relationship between soil OC contents estimated in the laboratory and the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured in the field. Specifically, geochemical elemental analyses were used to evaluate the OC content and relative isotopic signature in collected soil samples from a hazelnut orchard in the Emilia–Romagna region of Northeastern Italy, while the geophysical Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) method enabled the in situ mapping of the ECa distribution in the same soil field. According to the results, geochemical and geophysical data were found to be reciprocally related, as both the organic matter and soil moisture were mainly incorporated into the fine sediments (i.e., clay) of the soil. Therefore, such a relation was used to create a map of the OC content distribution in the investigated field, which could be used to monitor the soil C sequestration on small-scale farmland and eventually develop precision agricultural services. In the future, this method could be used by farmers and regional and/or national policymakers to periodically certify the farm’s soil conditions and verify the effectiveness of carbon sequestration. These measures would enable farmers to pursue Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) incentives for the reduction of CO2 emissions.

Abstract Pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) offers a cost-effective means to store electrical energy for long duration by utilizing a heat pump cycle to transfer thermal energy from a low temperature reservoir (LTR) to a high temperature reservoir (HTR). The heat pump compressor, which represents a significant driver to the cost, performance and operating characteristics of the PTES system. During charging (&gt;100 MW), traditional compressor scaling charts indicate that the operating conditions needed would be best served by a multistage axial compressor. The conceptual design of a large-scale CO2 axial compressor was completed, including mean-line estimates of the compressor performance at full power conditions. At steady state, full power operation, the isentropic efficiency and mechanical efficiency of the compressor have significant impact on the cycle design and round trip efficiency of the PTES system. The results of the conceptual design were used to refine the PTES cycle design and updated operating conditions provided for further aero design optimization. An important characteristic of the PTES system is its ability to charge at variable rate, which provides significant challenges on compressor operability, especially for a compressor that will be coupled to a fixed-speed synchronous motor. Cycle studies of variable charging rate processes have been conducted, and the impact of compressor operating map characteristics explored. Based on initial modeling studies, single compressor operation can be achieved down to at least 50% of rated power, with further reductions possible depending on the characteristics of the compressor map speedlines.

Electricity consumption in buildings is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which drive climate change. Reducing electricity use in residential buildings, which account for approximately 20% of Thailand’s total electricity consumption, represents a key opportunity for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through the use of appropriate solar absorptance in wall paint, conducted via an energy simulation using a representative residential building model from Bangkok. The DOE2.1E program was employed to simulate a standard two-story house commonly found in Thailand, with an approximate floor area of 120 square meters. The window-to-wall ratios were set at 10% and 20%, and air conditioning usage was modeled for nighttime hours. External wall paint was assigned varying solar absorption coefficients, ranging from 10% to 90%. Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated by multiplying the simulated annual electricity consumption by the emission factor, expressed in kgCO2eq/kWh, provided by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization. The results indicated that adjusting wall paint solar absorptance from 10% to 90% led to a 10% variation in both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, potentially reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 411–456 kgCO2eq per house per year. Therefore, implementing regulations that mandate the use of wall paints with appropriate solar absorption coefficients could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to environmental protection efforts in Thailand.

The rising demand for water and energy is driving the overuse of natural resources and contributing to environmental degradation. To address these challenges, the focus has shifted to low- and zero-emission technologies that utilize alternative sources of water and energy. Although such systems are commonly applied in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, facilities along transportation routes generally depend on grid connections. This study aimed to enhance operational independence and reduce environmental impacts by modernizing the Rest Area Stobierna (RAS) along Poland’s S19 expressway, part of the Via Carpatia road. A comprehensive technical, economic, and environmental analysis was conducted using HOMER Pro software (3.18.3 PRO Edition) and a simulation model based on YAS operating principles. The proposed Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) incorporates photovoltaic panels, battery storage, and a rainwater harvesting system (RWHS). Two configurations of the HRES were evaluated, a prosumer-based setup and a hybrid-island mode. Optimization results showed that the hybrid-island configuration was most effective, achieving a 61.6% share of renewable energy in the annual balance, a 7.1-year return on investment, a EUR 0.77 million reduction in Net Present Cost (NPC), and a 75,002 kg decrease in CO2 emissions over the system’s 25-year lifecycle. This study highlights the potential of integrating renewable energy and water systems to improve sustainability, reduce operational costs, and enhance service quality in road infrastructure facilities, offering a replicable model for similar contexts.

Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) is a promising green and sustainable energy source, gaining prominence in light of the dual-carbon target. This study investigated the SGE resources in the Yinchuan area. Suitability zones and the potential of SGE resources were determined based on the comprehensive analysis about thermophysical parameters, hydrogeological conditions, and geological environment. Our findings revealed that the effective thermal conductivity in the Yinchuan area surpasses those of other cities, indicating significant potential for SGE. The thermostat layer depth ranges from 40 to 60 m, with a geothermal gradient between 0.81 and 6.19 °C/100 m. Regions with poor adaptability for a borehole heat exchanger (BHE) are mainly distributed in the western and southern parts of the Yinchuan area, whereas moderately and highly adaptable areas are primarily located in the central and eastern areas, respectively. The total geothermal resource of the BHE in the Yinchuan area amounts to 1.07 × 108 GJ/a, generating significant economic benefits of 1.07 × 109 CNY/a and saving 1.09 × 106 t/a of standard coal annually. This initiative leads to significant reductions in CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions by 2.61 × 106 t/a, 1.86 × 104 t/a, and 6.57 × 103 t/a, respectively. Additionally, it results in potential savings of 0.309 × 109 CNY/a in environmental treatment costs. The methods and models used in this study have potential for similar geothermal surveys in arid and cold regions. The results also contribute essential insights for policy formulation and sustainable development strategies related to shallow geothermal resources in the Yinchuan area.

Globally, 1.5 billion annual tire outputs generate a substantial volume of end-of-life tires (ELTs), creating significant environmental challenges. Despite increased recovery rates, ELT management costs in Europe underscore the need for proactive strategies to mitigate environmental and health risks. This study comprehensively evaluates the environmental impact of disposal methods, including landfilling, incineration, and crumb rubber production, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) via the OpenLCA software 2.0.2. While incineration is sometimes identified as a disposal method, unprocessed scrap tires have potential applications in civil engineering that can better align with sustainability goals. Detailed ELT composition analysis reveals significant recycling potential, with car and truck tires containing 10–20% steel fiber content, less than 1–8% textile fibers, and approximately 80% natural and synthetic rubber content. Recycling 1 ton of ELTs saves an estimated 1.4–1.6 tons of CO2 Eq. compared to incineration. Mechanical recycling and application of recycled crumb rubber in concrete show significant environmental advantages, reducing mass density by approximately 55% and enhancing ductility by up to 40%, according to material testing results. These properties make crumb rubber particularly suitable for acoustic and resilient applications. Additionally, its elasticity and durability offer effective solutions for shoreline reinforcement, mitigating erosion and providing stability during flooding events. When used as a replacement for river sand in cement composites, crumb rubber contributes to a 24.06% reduction in CO₂ emissions, highlighting its potential for environmentally friendly construction.

The green unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains 12–13 carbonic anhydrases (CAs). For a long time, the two closely related α-CAs of the periplasmic membrane CAH1 and CAH2 were considered to be the CAs with the highest CO2 hydration activity. The recombinant protein α-CA CAH3 (rCAH3) from the thylakoid lumen obtained in the present study showed more than three times higher activity compared to CAH1 and more than 11 times higher compared to previous studies with rCAH3. Long-term sustainability of the enzyme was observed at alkaline pH (&gt;8), with maintenance of half of its activity at 4 °C up to 50 days. Thermostability of rCAH3 indicated the retention of the activity at 20 °C for one hour at pH 9–10 with its ~50% decrease at pH 6–7. However, the residual activity of rCAH3 after incubation at extremely high temperature (75 °C) for 15 min led to formation of the double-hump graph with maxima at pH 6 and 9. The enzyme demonstrated high sensitivity to ethoxyzolamide and acetazolamide at nM concentrations, to Zn2+ and Cu2+ cations at 1 mM concentrations, and L-cysteine was able to completely inhibit CA activity of rCAH3 through reduction of sulfhydryl groups. Esterase activity of rCAH3 was well detected with values comparable to those of bovine CAII, but with a maximum at pH 8 instead of pH 9, which is usual for bovine CAII. The results indicated that CAH3 may be the most active CA of C. reinhardtii and that its role in the photosynthetic apparatus function could have been underestimated in previous works.

Abstract The aerospace industry aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, requiring gas turbine engines to reduce CO2 emissions. This will impact engine material selection due to harsher operating conditions, limiting traditional metal/alloy use. While fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) composites are commonly used in the aerospace industry, their use in gas turbine engines is often restricted by the lower operating temperatures of the polymer matrix. However, many studies have demonstrated the tribological potential of FRP in the fan section of the engines, but little attention has been given to the potential of orienting the fibers in the normal (i.e., out-of-plane) direction relative to the wear surface to leverage the anisotropic properties of FRP composites. This study aims to investigate the impact of fiber orientation on the tribological properties of carbon fiber/PEEK (CF-PEEK) at elevated temperatures. Three CF-PEEK samples with different fiber rientations were selected for the purpose of this study (parallel, anti-parallel and normal directions), as well as a fourth sample of pure PEEK. Tribological tests were conducted using a ball-on-disk tribometer at an elevated temperature of 200°C to evaluate wear and friction behavior. The worn surfaces and counterfaces were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The findings reveal that CF-PEEK with fibers oriented in the normal direction demonstrates significantly enhanced tribological performance at elevated temperatures, achieving a 95% reduction in the friction coefficient and a 92% decrease in the wear rate compared to pure PEEK. A wear mechanism has been proposed to explain the superior wear resistance of normally oriented fibers in CF-PEEK, linking it to the development of a fiber-based interface during the run-in phase and the formation of a uniform transfer film.

The challenge of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management has become a critical barrier to the harmonious development of society. China has implemented MSW classification as a pivotal strategy for fostering ecological civilization. Despite extensive research on waste management, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluations that integrate both socio-economic and environmental impacts of MSW, particularly in the context of urban ecological systems. In response, this paper developed an integrated system dynamics (SD) model to evaluate the impacts of MSW classification on urban ecology and economy in Beijing, China. This model comprises three subsystems: waste generation, socio-economic benefit, and environment-resource benefit subsystem. It incorporates feedback loops, sensitivity tests, and extreme scenario testing, all of which have validated the robustness and consistency of the model. Scenario analysis was conducted to examine benefits and loss of MSW classification under different conditions. Using the MSW classification in Beijing from 2010 to 2019 as a case, the model assesses the socio-economic, environmental, and resource effects of waste classification. The assessment of results indicate a correlation between increasing separation rates of MSW and socio-economic gains. Specifically, as the separation rate rises, the socio-economic benefits shift from negative to positive. At optimal MSW separation rates, these benefits could represent up to 0.78% of Beijing's GDP. Environmentally, the model suggests that greenhouse gas emission reductions (in CO2 equivalent) over the 2010–2019 period could have varied from 2.4–3.62 million tons annually. Additionally, our findings reveal that for every 1% increase in MSW separation rate, the yearly potential land savings might range from 1,069.92 m² to 1,276.98 m². These insights from the SD model underscore the importance of waste classification. They serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, and motivate resident participation in waste classification, highlighting the significant role of waste classification in sustainable development.

Soil salinization is an important stress factor that limits plant growth and yield. Increased salinization is projected to affect more than 50% of all arable land by 2050. In addition, the growing demand for food, together with the increase in the world population, forces the need to seek salt-tolerant crops. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is an Andean crop of high importance, due to its nutritional characteristics and high tolerance to different abiotic stresses. The aim of this work is to determine the physiological, anatomical, and biochemical salt-tolerance mechanisms of a salt-tolerant (Vikinga) and a salt-sensitive (Regalona) quinoa variety. Plants were subjected to salinity stress for 15 days, starting at 100 mM NaCl until progressively reaching 400 mM NaCl. Physiological, anatomical, and biochemical parameters including growth, chlorophyll content, quantum yield of PSII (ϕPSII), gas exchange, stomatal density, size, and lipid peroxidation (via malondialdehyde, MDA) were measured. Results show that chlorophyll content, ϕPSII, and MDA were not significantly reduced under saline stress in both varieties. The most stress-affected process was the CO2 net assimilation, with an up to 60% reduction in both varieties, yet Vikinga produced higher dry weight than Regalona due to the number of leaves. The stomatal densities increased under salinity for both varieties, with Regalona the one showing higher values. The averaged stomatal size was also reduced under salinity in both varieties. The capacity of Vikinga to generate higher dry weight is a function of the capacity to generate greater amounts of leaves and roots in any condition. The stomatal control is a key mechanism in quinoa’s salinity tolerance, acquiring higher densities with smaller sizes for efficient management of water loss and carbon assimilation. These findings highlight the potential of Vikinga for cultivation in temperate salinized environments during winter, such as Deltas and lowlands where rice is grown during summer.

Abstract This paper provides an overview of Enbridge Gas Transmission and Midstream’s PHMSA special permitted project to install and use Smartpipe® to retrofit 0.64 miles of an 8-inch diameter, 1965 vintage steel pipeline, known as the Line 3320A-100. The new 6.25-inch internal diameter (ID), 7.6-inch outer diameter (OD) Smartpipe® was inserted through a small segment of the existing 8-inch diameter steel pipeline, which improves pipeline integrity and safety by eliminating corrosion and increasing resistance to third-party damage. Smartpipe® also significantly reduced the environmental impact and disturbance associated with the excavation, earth disturbance, and other activities that would have been necessary with removal of the existing 8-inch diameter steel pipeline and the installation of a new steel pipeline in the right of way (ROW). In addition to an overview of the engineering design and construction of the project, the short- and long-term use case of the Smartpipe technology over traditional materials is explored. Smartpipe® offers a high strength composite pipe liner solution that involves a trenchless installation within the existing steel line to minimize disruption to both operations and the environment. Embedded fibre optics within the Smartpipe® offer real time leak detection monitoring capabilities and ROW activity real time monitoring along the entire length of the pipe. This ESG centric solution not only provides a reduction in carbon footprint when compared to traditional construction methods (open trench pipe replacement and horizontal directional drill replacement) and it is designed to address high consequence and difficult to access areas where operator systems may pass through. Smartpipe® has high pressure capabilities to provide repurposing opportunities for aging, derated and abandoned pipe assets. Smartpipe® is DOE tested for hydrogen use and compatibility with CO2 to provide a bridge to future energy sources. This study serves as a valuable case for industry professionals, offering lessons learned, a PHMSA special permit application template for Smartpipe® replacements as well as education and knowledge on the Smartpipe® technology and installation considerations.

Summary Over the past decade, more than 40,000 multifractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) were completed in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), making Canada the third largest oil exporter in 2022. However, this process consumed more than 56 billion gallons of water, with more than 30 billion gallons unrecovered—equivalent to the annual water consumption of a city of 1 million for nearly 5 years. This raises concerns about water use efficiency in fracturing operations. Can big data mining reveal the relationship between reservoir quality, fracturing design parameters, and process efficiency? This research aims to develop a hybrid analytical and machine learning (ML) workflow to optimize completion design as a function of reservoir quality in tight reservoirs. To achieve this objective, we analyze data from more than 14,000 wells in the Montney formation. Using core analysis and well log data, we develop a support vector machine (SVM) to predict permeability and a fuzzy clustering model to estimate fracturability. We categorize Montney’s lithology through hierarchical clustering. With 3D kriging interpolation, we fill missing data and create high-resolution 3D petrophysical maps, which help derive a reservoir quality index (RQI) map to identify the sweet spots for completing new wells. We introduce a stage placement efficiency (SPE) metric to evaluate fracture stage placements in-line with the RQI. Finally, we develop neural network–based proxies that predict well performance based on reservoir quality, geomechanical properties, and completion design, incorporating more than 40 completion parameters, the RQI, and historical production data. The results reveal a higher degree of homogeneity in the upper Montney compared to the middle and lower segments. Generally, completion design parameters significantly impact MFHW productivity more than formation characteristics. Applying the proposed proxy to Montney-oil MFHWs could increase fracturing water recovery by 94.4%, reduce injected water volume by 22%, and boost cumulative oil production by 37.9%. The proxy aims to enhance fracturing water efficiency. A 1% reduction in freshwater consumption in the WCSB could save more than 100 million gallons of fresh water and cut CO2 emissions by up to 2,000 tons, equivalent to removing more than 1,000 gasoline cars from Canadian roads.

His initial research interest focused on surface reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, and later expanded to include electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis for energy harvesting and conversion. Notably, his seminal contributions to the fundamental understanding of CO2 and N2 reduction have led to new advances in designing electrocatalytic systems for sustainable fuels.He remains a leading advocate for reducing our carbon footprint through the development of sustainable fuels. The Department of Physics at DTU has been organizing a summer school for students and young researchers for the last two decades. (1) During my recent participation in the 2024 SurfCat Summer School (Figure 1), I had the opportunity to converse with Prof. Ib Chorkendorff.Figure 1Figure 1.

Kamat)High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlidePK: What were the early motivations that led you to get interested in electrocatalysis research?IC: From a young age, I was deeply interested in energy and energy conversion. This interest dates back to my high school days in the 1970s in Denmark, when car-free Sundays were introduced due to gasoline and oil shortages─an energy vulnerability that left a lasting impression on me.During my studies, I specialized in surface science, though without focusing specifically on energy, as the crisis had subsided for the time being. While working on my master's degree, I had the opportunity to spend six months at Haldor Topsoe A/S, a Danish catalyst manufacturer. This experience helped me realize what I wanted to pursue as a career. After completing my Ph.D. in surface science of rare earth metals and their alloys, I did my postdoctoral work with John Yates at the University of Pittsburgh, where I earned experience on surface reactions and catalysis.In the early part of my career, I focused on single-crystal surface reactions and thermal catalysis, supported by collaborations with Haldor Topsoe, who encouraged more rigorous teaching of these subjects at DTU. By the turn of the century, I returned to my passion for energy, initiating a project called "Towards a Hydrogen Society", where fuel cells were seen as an efficient energy source.Initially, electrochemistry held little appeal for me, as I associated it mainly with corrosion of automobiles and electroplating, both of which I found uninteresting. However, from an energy perspective, new possibilities opened up, and I began exploring fundamental single-crystal studies, fuel cells, and eventually photoelectrocatalysis. In recent years, my work has focused on energy conversion─particularly water splitting─and the challenge of coupling protons directly to CO2 or N2 to produce chemicals and fuels.My approach has generally been based on my background in surface science. I avoided battery research, since much of the activity in that field occurs at buried interfaces that are challenging to access with these methodologies. Nevertheless, I eventually ventured into that area as well, particularly in the context of ammonia synthesis, which involved a lithium-mediated process where complex solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) layers form. Although I found ways around this challenge, a deeper understanding of the SEI layer remains still desirable.Overall, my journey has been driven by the desire for energy self-sufficiency and a curiosity about the atomic-level processes underlying catalytic reactions.PK: What are the current grand challenges in electrocatalysis research? How does your Center strategize the efforts to address them?IC: The ultimate goal of our center is to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and the most straightforward way to achieve this is by entirely out-phasing fossil fuels. This approach should take priority over, for example, CO2 sequestration for good, which I fear may serve as an excuse for oil companies to continue with "business as usual". Achieving fossil-free energy is feasible since we have abundant solar and wind resources, even in a northern country like Denmark. Let's electrify everything we can and then concentrate on finding solutions for what cannot be electrified.To manage energy sustainably, we'll need to store it long-term in the form of chemical energy. We will also need to produce chemicals and fuels, the latter primarily for applications like long-haul shipping and aviation, where electrification is less viable. From an electrochemical perspective, this process begins with water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen─an essential step that, despite being established for centuries, still involves a ∼30% energy loss. Reducing this loss is crucial. While some argue that energy will be "free" in the future, this is unrealistic; people investing in solar panels and wind turbines will want a return. The negative prices for renewable energy are likely only during a transitional period where we need to create a market for energy conversion which is basically non-existing today.Hydrogen produced from water splitting can support well-established thermal catalysis for manufacturing chemicals and fuels from CO2 and N2. These processes may need to adapt, though, as energy becomes decentralized. For example, while ammonia production today relies on large facilities due to the capital-intensive Haber–Bosch process caused by its high operating pressure, it might make more sense to shift to a decentralized approach since both energy production and fertilizer use are very delocalized.The oxygen generated from water splitting will also be valuable, as it can support biomass combustion in power plants to stabilize intermittent renewable energy sources. This process will produce CO2 at much higher concentration, which we can use as a feedstock for synthesizing organic chemicals and aviation fuel. So, in this context, CO2 capture and storage is relevant. We are asking questions like, "Can we make the conventional processes more efficient or find entirely new routes for energy conversion?" It is naturally also important to ask if it makes any sense─often we see new approaches where simple energy efficiency calculation rules them out beforehand. We are currently focusing on electrochemical hydrogenation of both CO2 and N2 to create competitive alternatives to conventional thermal processes. Entirely new approaches like photoelectrocatalysis, which captures light energy and directly converts it into fuels or chemicals, remains an attractive concept that we also have pursued. However, we also recognized that it may not be viable within the time frame needed to address climate challenges, so we have reallocated more funding to ammonia synthesis, exploring both thermal and electrochemical approaches. Combining these two approaches may ultimately be the most effective option. This flexibility in funding allows us to make strategic adjustments as we gain new insights and progress.PK: Water electrolyzers have been commercialized for large-scale hydrogen generation. What other electrocatalysis-based technologies are likely to emerge in the near future?IC: In my opinion, good progress has been made in electrochemical CO2. The field has managed to achieve reasonable current densities, though challenges remain with selectivity, stability and energy efficiency. I find N2 hydrogenation particularly interesting, but it is further from the target, as the current density is still an order of magnitude too low, and energy efficiency needs improvements by a factor of at least 3–4.There are also some more localized solutions that are of interest: For example, we have made a spin-off company, HpNow, that focuses on electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide. Such decentralized facilities could also be used to upgrade waste streams or for cleaning purposes. However, these applications are more aligned with niche industries rather than addressing the larger-scale challenges.PK: You have co-founded three companies based on the work carried out in your laboratory. What were some of the challenges you encountered in taking the laboratory work to the development of commercial products?IC: First, I'd like to point out that starting companies has often happened more by opportunity than by initial planning. Sometimes, you gain enough insight to see potential, and if Ph.D. students or postdocs are interested in pursuing it, starting a company becomes a possibility. In principle, it's relatively easy to start a company; however, creating one that actually turns a profit, rather than simply burning through investments, is a completely different challenge. The current investment climate makes getting started feasible, but the real hurdle is scaling up to mass production. This stage requires much more capital, and it's often where scientists lose influence and interest. Fortunately, there are others who thrive on this phase and enjoy managing those challenges.Of the three companies I've helped start, two are still healthy and active─HPNow and Spectroinlets─while the technology from the third company, RenCat, was recently bought out by Alfa Laval, which I also consider a success. There have also been other startups from our lab, though I'm not directly involved with them as I didn't believe they were viable.PK: What is your advice to young researchers who aspire to engage in renewable energy research?IC: I would say to any young researcher aspiring to make science a career: stay curious and appreciate that, as a university professor, you have the freedom to choose your field of research─provided you can secure funding for it. Also, you will have great colleagues and meet many interesting and friendly people on your path. Of course, you should also enjoy teaching, as it's an integral part of being a professor. There are also excellent opportunities in industry that can fulfill many of the same goals, though the degree of freedom is naturally not the same.Scientifically, renewable energy research presents many unanswered questions that are essential to solving our pressing global challenges. This field is appealing because it is easy to justify why this type of research is important and how it can contribute to a better world. However, the main driving force should still be curiosity, as that's what propels research forward. You may not achieve your initial goal, but along the way, you might gain deeper insights that contribute to the field, paving the way for future breakthroughs by you or others.Research is far from a straightforward path from A to B. Sometimes, unexpected solutions emerge while trying to answer completely different questions or challenges. For this reason, it's important to stay open-minded and opportunistic, looking beyond the immediate project.Finally, I would encourage the research community to be more rigorous in their approach. Too often, the focus is on the quantity of publications rather than the content and quality. Research quality could be significantly improved if we adhered to the "good old school" standards, where measurement uncertainties were carefully considered and reported. I always say, "seeing something once doesn't mean you've truly seen it." Ideally, I like to see results replicated three times to establish measurement reliability and give a standard deviation. Unfortunately, too often, observations are measured only once and cannot be reproduced. So, tighten up your ship, because, as Richard Feynman famously said, "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool."With that, I wish you good luck out there. Nothing beats luck, but it usually only comes after hard work─and one must also be capable of recognizing it.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!AuthorPrashant V.

[Laura Gónzalez López](https://openalex.org/A5049732748), No host. None(None)] 2021.https://doi.org/10.5821/dissertation-2117-420258.
    
(English) Currently there is a growing concern about the sustainability of the construction sector due to its great contribution to climate change. Approximately one third of carbon dioxide emissions are produced by this sector, both during the construction and operational phases of buildings. Another environmental problem is the abundance of waste produced by industrial processes and products at the end of their useful life. In this sense, the use of more sustainable building materials and, in particular, the reduction of the necessary amount of cement is of great interest. This thesis focuses on developing and characterizing sustainable cement-based building materials reinforced with biodegradable nonwoven fabrics or produced from fibers recovered from textile wastes, mainly designed to be applied on thin panels for application on ventilated facades, pavements and reinforcement of masonry structures, as well as for the development of multifunctional sandwich panels for applications on facades or ceilings. The first phase of the research focuses on the preparation and characterization of the nonwoven structures. On the one hand, nonwoven fabrics are prepared from biodegradable fibers such as flax fiber, and on the other hand, nonwoven fabrics are prepared with fibers from post-consumer textile waste, both of a technical nature such as aramid fibers, or from end-of-life textiles from fashion, such as cotton-polyester blends. In a second phase, the preparation and characterization of the reinforced composite materials is carried out. The compounds are characterized mechanically (with the bending-deformation test), microstructurally (with observations from SEM and BSEM) and finally the thermal and fire resistance properties are evaluated. In a third and final phase of the research, comparisons are established between the different reinforcements, evaluating the reinforcement capacities that each of these textiles give to the cement matrix. From the results, it can be concluded that cementitious composite materials reinforced with the nonwoven fabrics developed in this thesis become a suitable material for its application as a construction material. Despite multiple works related to the recovery of textile waste and its applications in composites have been published, there is limited knowledge about the combination of raw materials that we propose in this project, as well as for its possible applications. In particular, there is also limited knowledge on cement-based composites in which the reinforcement is a nonwoven fabric prepared from biodegradable fibers or recovered from textile waste. In this sense, composites reinforced with textile waste represent a great advance in sustainability for the sector, in addition to offering resistance properties that are highly suitable for this type of construction applications. The results will help to develop new sustainable building materials with a high content of raw materials recovered from waste and that, applied in panels for ventilated facades, floors and roofs or for the reinforcement of masonry, will contribute to improve the energy efficiency of buildings already reduce emissions generated for the construction sector. (Español) Actualmente existe una preocupación creciente por la sostenibilidad del sector de la construcción debido a su gran contribución al cambio climático. Aproximadamente un tercio de las emisiones de dióxido de carbono son producidas por este sector, tanto durante la fase de construcción como operativa de edificios. Otro problema ambiental es la abundancia de desechos producidos por los procesos industriales y los productos al final de su vida útil. En este sentido, el uso de más materiales de construcción sostenibles y, en particular, la reducción de la cantidad necesaria de cemento es de gran interés. Esta tesis se centra en desarrollar y caracterizar materiales de construcción sostenibles a base de cemento reforzados con telas no tejidas biodegradables o bien producidas a partir de fibras recuperadas de residuos textiles, principalmente diseñados para ser aplicados sobre paneles delgados para su aplicación en fachadas ventiladas, pavimentos y refuerzo de estructuras de mampostería, así como para el desarrollo de paneles sándwich multifuncionales para aplicaciones en fachadas o techos. La primera fase de la investigación se centra en la preparación y caracterización de las estructuras no tejidas. Por un lado, se preparan telas no tejidas a partir de fibras biodegradables como es la fibra de lino, y por otro lado se preparan telas no tejidas con fibras procedentes de residuos textiles post-consumo, tanto de carácter técnico como es la fibra de aramida como procedentes de textiles en desuso del ámbito de la moda, como son las mezclas algodón-poliéster. En una segunda fase se realiza la preparación y caracterización de los materiales compuestos reforzados. Los compuestos se caracterizan mecánicamente (con el ensayo a flexión-deformación), microestructuralmente (con observaciones de SEM y BSEM) y finalmente se evalúan las propiedades térmicas y de resistencia al fuego. En una tercera y última fase de la investigación se establecen comparativas entre los diferentes refuerzos, observando las propiedades de resistencia que le otorgan cada uno de estos refuerzos textiles a la matriz de cemento. Se concluye que los materiales compuestos cementantes reforzados con telas no tejidas deviene un material apto para su aplicación como material de construcción. A pesar de la existencia de múltiples trabajos relacionados con la recuperación de residuos textiles y sus aplicaciones en composites, existe un conocimiento limitado sobre la combinación de las materias primas con residuos particulares que proponemos en este proyecto, así como para sus posibles aplicaciones. Particularmente, también hay un conocimiento limitado sobre compuestos a base de cemento en los que el refuerzo es una tela no tejida preparada a partir de fibras biodegradables o recuperadas de desechos textiles. En este sentido, los compuestos reforzados con residuos textiles suponen un gran avance en materia de sostenibilidad para el sector, además de ofrecer propiedades de resistencia muy adecuadas para este tipo de aplicaciones en construcción. Los resultados ayudarán a desarrollar nuevos materiales de construcción sostenibles con un alto contenido en materias primas recuperadas de residuos y que, aplicados en paneles para fachadas ventiladas, suelos y cubiertas o para el refuerzo de mampostería, contribuirá a mejorar la eficiencia energética de los edificios y a reducir las emisiones generadas para el sector de la construcción.    

    

## How to reduce your lab's carbon footprint

Although we are all dedicated to conducting high-quality, cutting-edge research in the basic and applied biomedical sciences, it is important to acknowledge the environmental impact of our work. The biomedical research sector is a significant contributor to the production of non-degradable plastics, as well as toxic and chemical waste (Urbina et al., 2015). Additionally, this sector demands substantial energy, not only for experimental work but also for computing, communication and data science activities. We are now facing emerging health and climate challenges, including increased pollution, the pervasive presence of microplastics and a rise in climate-related health issues that stem, in part, from our research. In recognition of our responsibility to future generations, it is imperative that we work actively to minimize our environmental footprint (Freese et al., 2024). Efforts need to be made in all sectors, including the biomedical research sector, to meet the UK's net zero CO2 emissions target by 2050. With this in mind, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI; one of the major funding agencies in the UK) recently co-produced a concordat for the Environmental Sustainability of Research and Innovation Practice (https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/environmental-sustainability-concordat), hosted by the Wellcome. A number of major funding bodies, such as Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Wellcome, and universities are signatories. Some UK funding bodies, such as Wellcome and CRUK, have also recently started asking the labs of grant holders to reduce the environmental impact of their research, and we will likely see other funding bodies following suit.Until very recently, most sustainability efforts have been driven by grassroots actions from a few labs (Dobbelaere et al., 2022). However, best sustainability practices are often not widely adopted because they remain for individual labs to develop and implement. This requires a considerable amount of time and knowledge from researchers. In addition, the exchange of best practices is largely through word-of-mouth between interested labs, although online forums and websites are now appearing (Box 1). Additionally, new practices and methods might raise suspicion and resistance if they have not been tested up to the exacting specifications required for high-quality science.Box 1. Online forums and blogsThe Company of Biologists' sustainability initiative. Launched in 2020, this initiative provides blog posts on the topic of sustainability. The Company of Biologists also offers grants to support sustainable conferencing events and a tree-planting scheme for every paper published. https://www.biologists.com/sustainability-hub/The 'lab concious' blog. This site offers advice and tips on sustainability, such as recycling and reuse, and provides information on environmentally friendly lab supplies. It also has a list of useful websites from other green groups. https://www.labconscious.com/blogThe Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework (LEAF).

EBMO recently launched this award to recognize pioneering progress in sustainability efforts in research. EMBO also publishes articles on sustainability in research. https://www.embo.org/the-embo-communities/embo-lab-sustainability-award/University of Edinburgh sustainability website. The University of Edinburgh provides a comprehensive website offering information, training and advice on sustainable topics in the context of education and research. https://www.ed.ac.uk/sustainabilityThe Sustainable European Laboratories network. This offers information and best practices on sustainability in research in Europe. It aims to support the establishment of green initiatives and influence policymakers and key stakeholders to make a positive impact on lab practices. https://sels-network.orgIt is becoming clear that research labs will be most successful in becoming more sustainable if all stakeholders are involved and supported (Woolston, 2024; Winter et al., 2023). Research institutions, universities and funders have an important role to play here in advising and supporting the research workforce, whether they are office or lab based, on how we can reduce our carbon footprint. At the moment, any efforts in making our workflows more sustainable usually come on top of the current existing workload of research staff. Sustainability workflows also have an upfront cost that needs to be met by funders: for example, although the reuse of lab consumables (such as glass pipettes and flasks) is considered to be more sustainable than using disposable or recyclable consumables, the costs associated with washing and reusing glass flasks or pipettes are often higher than those associated with the use of disposable counterparts (owing to the staff costs involved in running a washing-up facility). This highlights the crucial need for continued funding of core facilities within research institutions. In addition, research labs consume more energy than offices, due to their particular requirements for ventilation, negative pressure and temperature control. Research institutions therefore need to be forward thinking when designing new research buildings to make them more energy efficient (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/29413.pdf) and mindful of the environment. Overall, all stakeholders – from those working in the lab to those providing funding and infrastructure – have an important role to play.The lab users – postdocs, PhD students, research staff – who work day-to-day in the lab will have a good idea of what workflows can be changed to reduce the energy used and the waste generated. There could be discussions within a group and/or a committee setup representing the individual groups within an institute or department. The decision-making and implementation process works best when all relevant parties feel engaged. The goals and targets must be clear, measurable and achievable for everyone. Setting targets, monitoring the reduction in energy, plastics or waste and having a reward system helps recognize people's efforts and contributions. It can also motivate people to further reduce their carbon footprint.Collective action and the sense of working towards a common goal can also provide a focal point for a department or institution, bringing people together. Websites and noticeboards hosted by the research institution, unit or department are useful ways to communicate initiatives and information both locally and more widely with labs at other institutions.Although it is important that people in the lab make their research practices more sustainable, there is regular lab turnover such that information or training might get lost. The principal investigator, however, will often have a good overview of the lab's history and a deeper understanding of the health and safety measures in place and how compatible they are with making workflows more sustainable. Even though they might spend less time in the lab, they might notice practices that can be improved. Waste reduction and sustainability should not be done at the expense of safety, but instead should work together to make our research programs more environmentally friendly.Additionally, some researchers and early-career scientists joining the lab might also suffer from eco-anxiety, which can cause mental health issues (Pearson, 2024; Lawrance, 2024) and could affect laboratory practices negatively. Supporting individuals to channel that anxiety and turn it into action towards sustainability goals, within the lab or department, will have a positive impact on the local research community and is a powerful way to look after everyone's mental health.Changing people's habits is difficult. For people to get engaged, the new workflow must be easy to implement. Ideally, the long-term goals and cost-benefits have to be clear. It also helps if there is training, a reward system, and an explicit long-term vision that mobilizes staff.Of course, you might think that if it is only your lab doing this, then the reduction in carbon footprint will be negligible. However, if many labs worldwide start adopting more ecological workflows, the impact will become significant. Below, are some easy tips that can help you and your lab get started: 1.Plan your experiment! The most efficient and sustainable way to carry out an experiment is to design it well, so that it works first time.2.Switch the temperature of the ULT freezer from −80°C to −70°C. This saves around 28% energy consumption (https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/efficient_ult_freezer_storage.pdf). Organize your freezers and make an inventory of their contents to minimize the time they are open for when searching for a reagent. Not only will you save energy, you will also save time and reduce frustration! Regularly defrost the freezers so they consume less energy.3.Put your equipment on a timer, so that it switches on and off automatically when possible, and switch off non-sensitive equipment in the evening. Ensure all lab members switch off non-essential equipment when they have finished using it.4.Label bottles (e.g. of solutions) with their contents, the date made and the person who made it. Record any chemicals that are ordered and the date they are received. This helps with managing the chemicals in the lab/institution and facilitates correct waste disposal. Work with your safety office to provide clear and accessible information about waste disposal. Make a list of commonly used lab chemicals and their waste disposal routes and make this list easily accessible to all researchers. A list of chemicals that cannot be disposed of via the sink should be posted in the lab. For some substances, only small volumes of these should be disposed of via sinks and they should be diluted.5.Use glass rather than plastic pipettes and flasks where possible. This significantly reduces the CO2 equivalent footprint (Farley and Nicolet, 2023), and the cost of glass washing is lower than the cost of using single-use plastic, once washing-up facilities are in place.6.Share and fix equipment within your department. Take steps to make equipment accessible to multi-users. The benefits are that the costs for maintenance and repair can be shared. A booking system can facilitate the coordination and tracking of users.7.Inactivate biological material rather than autoclave it. All biological waste is incinerated for biosafety reasons, so autoclaving is often unnecessary. Replacing autoclaving with inactivation where possible saves energy.8.Reuse should always be the top choice, with recycling the second option. Much of the packaging used for life science consumables can be reused, with some providers allowing returns of polystyrene (Winter et al., 2023) and packages for this purpose. Distributors are also moving away from plastic and polystyrene packing, thanks to the community's demands for biodegradable packaging. Insulated packaging is become increasingly eco-friendly. For example, hemp, paper straw and sheep wool are easily recycled but can also be used for other projects.9.Offer an induction to students and laboratory newcomers to explain the laboratory's sustainable practices. Ideally the institution or department will offer this training on a regular basis as there is a fast turnover within academia.10.Adopt a climate-conscious approach to travel and collaborations – think about where and how often you travel, and what mode of transport you use; find collaborations and networks that are accessible via low-carbon travel. These often work well because you might be able to meet and discuss science in person more frequently or be in the same time zone to setup online discussions. Local collaborations also facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise between early career researchers because such interactions can be more spontaneous.The lockdowns during COVID showed us how important communication and social interactions are to humans. It also taught many of us about the power of online discussion and meetings. During the lockdowns, we all participated in virtual meetings that enabled us to remain connected, work together and facilitate knowledge exchange. Since then, virtual and hybrid meetings have become commonplace. However, this shift also highlighted the limitations of online meetings and seminars compared to their in-person counterparts. When attending events online, many distractions can make it challenging to maintain focus. Additionally, engaging with other scientists online does not replicate the valuable and often spontaneous discussions that occur during coffee breaks or while queuing for lunch at in-person events. These spontaneous interactions often spark innovative ideas and foster collaborations, underscoring the irreplaceable nature of face-to-face meetings. Attending meetings is essential for keeping up to date with the advancements of the field and in-person attendance at meetings is particularly important for early-career researchers to build their networks. Nonetheless, when organizing an in-person conference or event, there are many aspects that can be improved to reduce its CO2 carbon footprint.For example, meeting organizers can select food that has a lower environmental impact while respecting people's dietary requirements. To reduce plastic waste, ask the caterers to provide fruit, biscuits and cakes that are freshly made, rather than biscuits and snacks in individual wrapping. Food could also be locally sourced and there could be a significant proportion of vegetarian food. It is important to select minimally processed food, as many highly processed items have non-conventional ingredients to which people might be intolerant or allergic (for example, pea, soya or buckwheat are increasingly common allergens) as well as tending to have a higher carbon footprint.In terms of the scientific program, it is possible to invite a keynote speaker to speak remotely. One can also encourage participants to travel by low-carbon transport, ideally by train. There are also alternatives to traditional in-person meetings. Multi-hub meetings, for example, are a new and interesting meeting model, whereby a meeting is run remotely in different countries with local in-person hubs that foster real interactions (Lowell et al., 2022). To support such incentives, it is possible to raise funding to provide travel awards to participants; EMBO and The Company of Biologists have funds to support greener travel and they are also open to funding innovative ways to make conferences sustainable. Further support, including advice and funding opportunities, can also be found at The Company of Biologists' sustainability hub (Box 1).Improving sustainability within our research workflows will substantially reduce our environmental impact and lower our carbon footprint. Additionally, it has the potential to foster greater inclusivity and enhance the engagement of our research communities. By involving all researchers and funding bodies that provide support for sustainable practices and national standards, our sector can transform biomedical research into a discipline that is significantly and positively sustainable.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can result from a variety of clinical conditions, causing lung injury either directly through local inflammation or indirectly because of systemic inflammatory mediators [1] ARDS is associated with high morbidity and mortality [2]. Its pathophysiology is complex, involving the activation and dysregulation of multiple overlapping pathways related to injury, inflammation, and coagulation, both in the lung and systemically [3]. Sepsis is the most common cause of ARDS, with pulmonary sepsis (e.g., pneumonia) being the predominant etiology. Non-pulmonary sepsis and non-infectious causes, such as pancreatitis, aspiration of gastric contents, and severe traumatic injuries accompanied by shock and multiple transfusions, also contribute significantly to ARDS cases. Despite decades of experimental research into ARDS biology, these insights have rarely translated into effective therapies [4]. This lack of progress is often attributed to the substantial heterogeneity caused by the nonspecific clinical definition of ARDS [5].Identifying subphenotypes of ARDS-more homogeneous groups within the broader ARDS population-has emerged as a promising approach to unravel the syndrome's clinical and biological complexity, which many believe is a critical barrier to discovering effective treatments.Mechanical ventilation (MV) remains the cornerstone of supportive care for ARDS patients.However, improper MV settings can cause complications, most notably ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [6]. The regional heterogeneity of lung injury, combined with the uneven distribution of mechanical stress during ventilation, results in multiple mechanisms of VILI simultaneously affecting the lungs. While VILI primarily concerns the harmful effects of MV, similar injury pathways can also be triggered by vigorous spontaneous inspiratory efforts, which produce elevated transpulmonary pressures due to highly negative pleural pressures [7]. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, amplified in the injured lung by harmful MV practices, can enter the systemic circulation, exacerbating systemic inflammation and contributing to non-pulmonary organ failure.The recognition of ARDS heterogeneity, encompassing its biological, physiological, and radiological aspects, has led to progress in identifying distinct subphenotypes. A precisionmedicine approach that effectively classifies ARDS into more homogeneous subphenotypes could enhance our understanding of the syndrome's pathophysiological mechanisms and how these vary across patients, ultimately paving the way for more targeted and effective treatments [8]. This editorial highlights key studies from the research topic "Personalized Therapies in ARDS: Volume II," covering personalized MV techniques, ARDS treatments tailored to etiology, sub-phenotyping, and novel pharmacological strategies. ARDS, even within a single etiology such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a heterogeneous syndrome requiring a personalized MV approach [9]. Evidence suggests that lung-protective MV strategies are not adhered to in approximately 69% of cases [10]. This underscores the need for individualized, yet standardized, MV management strategies informed by a comprehensive understanding of the patient's physiology. In this line, Patel et al. conducted a multicenter international randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 95 ARDS patients to evaluate the feasibility of a physiological model-based decision support system (DSS) for tailoring MV strategies. Patients were randomized to receive either standard care (control) or DSS-guided care (intervention). Although there was no significant difference in average driving pressure between the groups, the intervention arm demonstrated improvements in the oxygenation index and ventilatory ratio during controlled MV mode compared to the control group. Additionally, the DSS led to a significant increase in ventilator adjustments, particularly for pressure settings and respiratory frequency.Importantly, the physiological condition of patients improved when approximately 60% of DSS recommendations were followed, reinforcing the value of personalized yet repeatable MV strategies. These findings highlight the potential of DSS tools to refine MV management, ultimately improving outcomes in ARDS patients through a more tailored approach.The equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic presented extreme challenges for many countries. To address the scarcity of devices, alternative strategies were proposed [11,12]. Despite the global resource limitations, the emphasis on personalized MV strategies remained strong, even in scenarios involving shared ventilation between patients. Achanta et al. explored a ventilator-sharing system through benchtop testing that allowed simultaneous ventilation of two patients using a single mechanical ventilator, coupled with a monitoring system to remotely track pulmonary mechanics. The study extended to a swine translational model of lung injury induced by saline lavage to validate the system's functionality in both bench and in vivo settings. The benchtop testing demonstrated precise delivery of MV parameters. In the animal model, specific target inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes were set, and the system successfully adjusted for differences between the two pigs. For instance, if one animal reached its target volume or pressure before the other, it experienced a prolonged end-inspiratory pause and stopped receiving flow until both targets were met. While the system introduced a relatively individualized approach to MV settings, addressing some limitations of previous designs, it did not allow for self-tests on the shared ventilator or individualized management of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [13] These limitations restrict its potential for safe application in human clinical settings.Over the past few decades, the primary objective of PEEP usage has evolved from solely improving oxygenation to prioritizing lung protection. An "optimal" PEEP simultaneously enhances alveolar recruitment and gas exchange while preventing overdistension and minimizing hemodynamic compromise. Once PEEP is set, it is important to regularly reassess its impact on cardiopulmonary function [14,15]. Circulatory failure can result from both too low and too high PEEP levels because they can raise pulmonary vascular resistance, hinder pulmonary circulation, and impede right ventricular performance [16]. Xingzheng et al. conducted a prospective paired-design study involving 52 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS to evaluate the effects of different PEEP levels on cardiovascular function and the incidence of acute cor pulmonale (ACP). The study tested PEEP settings of 5 cmH₂O, 10 cmH₂O, and 15 cmH₂O, while maintaining end-inspiratory plateau pressure ≤30 cmH₂O. The incidence of ACP was 25%, with the highest occurrence observed at a PEEP of 15 cmH₂O.As PEEP levels increased from 5 to 10 and 15 cmH₂O, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) ratio improved. However, higher PEEP values were associated with a modest rise in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂). At a PEEP of 15 cmH₂O, significant adverse cardiovascular effects were noted, including reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, increased right ventricular end-diastolic area, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, a 14% reduction in cardiac index, and an 18.1% drop in stroke volume index compared to PEEP settings of 5 or 10 cmH₂O. Additionally, higher PEEP levels led to a marked decline in the end-diastolic volume index and extravascular lung water index. This study highlights the variability in ACP incidence depending on the PEEP setting in ARDS patients. PEEP levels must be carefully individualized based on the patient's cardiovascular function to optimize outcomes. Atakul et al. evaluated a closed-loop oxygen control system in 33 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) undergoing invasive MV for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patients were randomized to begin with either manual adjustment or a two-hour period of closed-loop oxygen titration. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels were maintained within a predetermined target range using either automated or manual FiO2 adjustments. The closedloop oxygen control demonstrated significant advantages: patients managed with the automated system spent a significantly higher percentage of time within the target SpO2 range compared to manual adjustment (95.7% vs. 65.6%). Additionally, the automated system achieved a higher median SpO2/FiO2 ratio (p=0.001), required a lower median FiO2 (32.1% vs. 40.6%, p=0.001), and significantly reduced the number of manual adjustments (p<0.001).Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is employed in patients with severe ARDS to support gas exchange, and deliver safe MV (Pplat), when other strategies fail to yield sufficient benefits [4]. Observational studies and meta-analysis found that ARDS patients in VV-ECMO significantly improved outcomes and lowered 60-day mortality more than those on traditional MV [17][18][19]. Current guidelines recommend using VV-ECMO for patients with severe ARDS, as defined by the EOLIA trial eligibility criteria, in centers meeting defined organizational standards. A bibliometric analysis by Lu et al. Sepsis-induced ARDS was more commonly linked to pulmonary infections caused by A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, which were associated with higher mortality rates, worse APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II scores, and poorer oxygenation indices compared to ARDS from non-pulmonary infections. Both the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and ROX index were negatively correlated with prognosis.The antioxidant effects of vitamin C therapy may mitigate tissue injury induced by oxidative stress in sepsis. However, in adults with sepsis receiving vasopressor therapy in the ICU, those who received intravenous vitamin C had a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days than those who received placebo [20]. Alissa et al., in their review, highlighted the potential benefits of co-administering vitamin C in patients with sepsis and septic shock caused by pneumonia leading to ARDS.In conclusion, the presentation of ARDS varies significantly across three key dimensions: (1) etiological, (2) physiological, and (3) biological. This variability emphasizes that a "typical" ARDS does not exist. The lack of a uniform presentation calls for a personalized medicine approach. Advanced subphenotyping and integrative analyses of these variations may uncover additional treatable traits, paving the way for more targeted therapies.

Climate change poses profound and urgent challenges to the health and wellbeing of people in Australia. With an average of 1.51°C of warming since records began,1 the health impacts of climate change are already being felt across Australia.2 Meanwhile, the health system itself is responsible, either directly or indirectly, for around 5.3% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.3 There is a clear need for Australia to achieve "healthy, climate-resilient communities, and a sustainable, resilient, high-quality, net zero health system."3 This vision is outlined in Australia's first National Health and Climate Strategy (hereafter, the Strategy), proudly launched in December 2023 by the Honourable Ged Kearney MP, Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care. In this perspective article, we review the Strategy's origins, development, and key features; discuss the challenges that must be tackled in the coming years; and highlight the leadership role that health professionals can play in the response to climate change. The National Health and Climate Strategy is built on decades of outstanding Australian work on climate change and human health. Australians have been at the forefront of climate and health research for more than thirty years, and have been pioneers in drawing the global health community's collective attention to the impacts of climate change on human health and wellbeing. We acknowledge the many individuals and organisations who have persistently advocated for human and planetary health for over a decade, and welcome their ongoing contributions and leadership in this space.4, 5 Consultation also highlighted the need to enable and embrace leadership on climate and health policy by First Nations people. Stakeholders spoke of the opportunities inherent in holistic partnerships with First Nations communities to improve health, reduce emissions and foster climate resilience. They also highlighted that First Nations peoples' deep and nuanced knowledge — developed over tens of thousands of years of close observation and sustained custodianship of Country — is not only crucial in addressing the impacts of climate change on First Nations peoples' health, but also can improve health and build climate resilience for all people in Australia. At the heart of the Strategy is an ambitious agenda to transform Australia's health system into one that is sustainable and climate resilient while improving care quality and health outcomes. The Australian Government recognises that insights and leadership from health professionals will be crucial to achieving this agenda. On health system decarbonisation, at the time of writing the Australian Government was working to publish baseline emissions estimates for the Australian health system, and to develop a net zero implementation guide for the Australian health system in collaboration with the Monash Sustainable Development Institute and state, territory and local health service partners. In the future, a key focus in our emissions reduction efforts will be supporting the provision of appropriate care and tackling unwarranted variations in care delivery. This will help to ensure that clinical care is of benefit to patients, and to avoid over-investigation, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The Strategy will also guide work to design interventions — in close collaboration with health professionals and consumers — that reduce emissions while maintaining or improving care quality. Fortunately, improving care quality and reducing emissions often go hand in hand. For example, improving objective diagnosis of asthma, education on inhaler technique, and increasing use of preventive inhalers can help to improve health outcomes while reducing emissions from respiratory inhalers containing greenhouse gases.6 On health system resilience, the Strategy recognises the need to build capacity to anticipate, understand, plan for, and respond to escalating climate impacts on health, wellbeing, and delivery of care. At a national level, this will involve an in-depth consideration of climate impacts on health and health systems as part of the National Climate Risk Assessment, and development of a Health National Adaptation Plan to provide an overarching framework for nationally consistent health-related adaptation. The Australian Government is also developing guidance and tools to support health system climate risk assessments and adaptation planning at a local level. In addition, a voluntary pilot of new safety and quality standards on environmental sustainability and climate resilience for health service organisations is currently being administered by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality Health Care.7 The pilot aims to help embed the principles of environmental sustainability and climate resilience in care delivery and governance, and will inform the next edition of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, which is due for release in 2027. Crucially, the Strategy reaches beyond the traditional confines of the health system, and seeks to promote health, sustainability and climate resilience across a variety of health-determining sectors. Many of the negative impacts of climate change on health will occur via impacts on the wider determinants of health, so it is critical that policies to ameliorate health impacts encompass these upstream drivers. Further, as measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sectors beyond the health system will have significant health co-benefits, there is an important role for the health sector to ensure these co-benefits are considered in policy and decision making. We hope the Strategy will provide a platform from which to ensure that the health co-benefits of emissions-reducing policies are considered and accounted for in the years ahead. The Strategy's Health in All Policies approach is embodied in a wide range of cross-government initiatives at the intersection of climate change and human health planned for the years ahead. For example, in recognition that housing is a key determinant of health and wellbeing, the Strategy includes a commitment to consider the health benefits of climate-resilient housing in developing the National Housing and Homelessness Plan. Given that population health would be improved markedly by widespread uptake of more environmentally sustainable diets,8 work is underway with the National Health and Medical Research Council to consider sustainability in the updated Australian Dietary Guidelines. The built environment is an important source of health systems emissions, and also a strong mediator of climate impacts on health, so the Strategy will promote the consideration of health and climate resilience in future updates to the National Construction Code. In her speech launching the Strategy at the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28), Assistant Minister Kearney noted that its release, "highlights a beginning, and ahead of us lies the journey of delivering its ambitious program of work."9 In 2024, the National Health, Sustainability and Climate Unit has taken some of the first steps on that journey. Work has commenced on 31 of the 49 actions within the Strategy, with 12 of those 31 actions completed or in the final stages of completion. Planning has also commenced to deliver a further 14 actions. In addition to publishing baseline health system emissions estimates, the Australian Government will shortly be publishing new academic research about opportunities to reduce waste and make food more sustainable in the Australian health system. We have also been working with industry, clinicians, patients and other stakeholders to reduce emissions from respiratory inhalers and anaesthetic gases. Several state health systems have already shown leadership by removing the high emissions anaesthetic gas desflurane from their medicines formularies, while organisations such as Asthma Australia and the National Asthma Council have laid the groundwork for optimising asthma inhaler use for better asthma and climate outcomes, including with the National Sustainable Asthma Care Roadmap.10 Meanwhile, the interim Australian Centre for Disease Control, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare, and the Council of Presidents of Medical Colleges have released a joint statement in which they agreed to work together to develop low-emissions models of care, and to mobilise and support the health workforce to lead the health system response to climate change.11 In implementing the Strategy, we expect to encounter challenges. These challenges include the need to resist siloed thinking and working to make the Strategy's Health in All Policies approach a practical reality. To help achieve this, we have established governance structures that will support multidisciplinary, cross-portfolio collaboration to deliver the Strategy's vision. Another key challenge will be achieving an appropriate level of national and international consistency, while also balancing the unique needs and circumstances of different jurisdictions. Many states, territories and local governments have led the way in health system decarbonisation and climate resilience to date. In implementing the Strategy, we will be looking to learn from and build on their innovation and progress, and seeking to add value to existing approaches. A key domain for Commonwealth leadership will be supporting international collaboration, particularly in areas that require changes to global supply chains and manufacturing practices. On Earth Day this year, the Australian Government announced that it has joined a collaboration with the United States and United Kingdom to align health system procurement standards to support decarbonisation.12 Commitment to this collaboration was reiterated at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.13 Australia is also engaged with efforts to develop new international standards for measuring the environmental impacts of health technology products. Frontline clinicians were instrumental in the Strategy's development, and will be even more crucial in its implementation. A net zero, climate-resilient health system must have as its bedrock a motivated, innovative, and upskilled workforce, that can translate the Strategy's vision and objectives into reality on the ground. Achieving such transformative change will require effective coupling of "top-down", government-led initiatives with "bottom-up" innovation and reform. The Strategy highlights a few examples of clinician-led initiatives that have already achieved exceptional outcomes for patients and the planet, and embody the creativity, care and collaboration that will be needed in the years ahead. For example, a team in the Royal Melbourne Hospital Emergency Department implemented a campaign to reduce unnecessary arterial blood gas and coagulation profile testing, which resulted in over 1200 unnecessary blood tests being avoided each month, with annual cost savings of $240 000 and emissions reductions of 900 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).3 We heard about dozens of inspiring frontline initiatives — and even more exciting ideas — such as this throughout Strategy consultations, and aim to support those on the frontlines to consolidate and expand their outstanding work. We have been impressed and inspired by clinicians' incredible passion for addressing climate change, and will work to support their longstanding, vital leadership towards a net zero, climate-resilient health system in the years ahead. The National Health and Climate Strategy sets an ambitious strategic direction for climate change and health policy in Australia. The Australian Government will lead the implementation of the Strategy over the next five years, and continue to pursue the Strategy's vision of "healthy, climate-resilient communities, and a sustainable, resilient, high-quality, net zero health system" over the coming decades. This work is a shared responsibility of every health professional and every part of the health system. We look forward to working collaboratively with stakeholders, including frontline health practitioners, to realise this vision in the years ahead.

[Lucía Belén Barandiarán Villegas](https://openalex.org/A5049131177), No host. None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.5821/dissertation-2117-420576.
    
(English) To address the impacts of climate change, several measures have been suggested among which utilizing renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy and implementing technologies such as hydrogen storage or CCUS. Some of these solutions imply the injection of fluids into fractured rock masses (e.g. depleted O&G reservoirs) with the subsequent change in local stress conditions. This alteration may lead to the initiation of micro-seismic events by reactivating existing faults or the generation of new fractures, with the risk of ultimately establishing pathways for fluid leakage. Additionally, depleted reservoirs contain multiphase and multicomponent fluids that could react chemically with the new injection fluids. Therefore, the accurate prediction of operation conditions demands advanced geomechanical software capable of evaluating the viability and safety of potential extraction or storage locations. In this context, the main objective of this thesis is to develop a thermo-hydro-mechanical multiphase model in fractured porous medium with the Finite Element Method using zero-thickness interface elements to model discrete discontinuities. The main assumptions of the model are: the small strain theory, the system composition with two fluid phases (liquid and gas), two species (water and dry gas) and one solid phase. The gas phase follows the ideal gas law and the liquid phase evaporation is considered. The main variables are: displacements, phase pressures and temperature. The formulation takes into account: the equilibrium equation, the mass balance equation of the water species, the mass balance equation of the gas species and the balance of energy. The formulation of the discontinuities considers similar assumptions as the porous medium and takes into account a reduction factor of the water retention curve parameters based on the mechanical opening of the fracture. The model has been implemented and validated with academic verification examples in a FE code. However, some limitations were observed related to the time integration scheme, the treatment of storage terms of the governing equations and the mass flow. This issues have motivated the following new developments: new mass-conservative approach for diffusion equations using FE formulations, a new physically-based exponential model which considers the pore size or aperture distribution in case of the porous medium or discontinuities, respectively, and a new damage-frictional law which properly models discontinuity closure. (Català) Per mitigar les conseqüències del canvi climàtic s'han proposat diverses mesures, entre les quals es troben l'ús d'energies renovables com la geotèrmia i el desenvolupament de tecnologies com l'emmagatzematge d'hidrogen o CO₂, que requereixen la injecció de fluids dins de massissos rocosos fracturats (com els reservoris abandonats), cosa que suposa un canvi en l'estat tensional d'aquests. Aquesta alteració pot ocasionar el desencadenament d'esdeveniments micro-sísimics mitjançant la reactivació de falles geològiques o la creació de noves fractures que, en última instància, formarien camins preferencials per a la filtració dels fluids. A més, els reservoris abandonats contenen fluids multifase amb més d'una espècie que podrien reaccionar químicament amb els nous fluids injectats. Per tant, la predicció precisa de les condicions d'operació requereix una anàlisi profunda de la problemàtica, així com disposar d'un programari geomecànic avançat capaç d'avaluar la viabilitat i la seguretat dels possibles llocs d'extracció o emmagatzematge. En aquest context, l'objectiu principal d'aquesta tesi és el desenvolupament d'un model termo-hidro-mecànic (THM) acoblat multifase en un medi porós fracturat mitjançant el mètode dels Elements Finits emprant elements junta de gruix nul de doble node per representar les discontinuïtats. Les principals hipòtesis del model són: la teoria de petites deformacions, un sistema compost per dues fases fluides (líquida i gasosa), dues espècies (aigua i gas) i una fase sòlida; la fase gasosa es comporta d'acord amb la llei dels gasos ideals i es considera l'evaporació de la fase líquida. Les variables primàries són: desplaçaments, pressions de fase i temperatura. La formulació contempla: l'equació d'equilibri, l'equació de balanç de massa de l'espècie aigua, l'equació de balanç de massa de l'espècie gas i el balanç d'energia. La formulació de les discontinuïtats considera les mateixes hipòtesis que el medi porós i pren en compte un factor de reducció dels paràmetres de la corba de retenció basat en l'obertura mecànica de la fractura. El model ha estat implementat i validat amb exemples de verificació acadèmics en un codi 3D d'Elements Finits. No obstant això, durant la fase de validació s'han trobat algunes limitacions del model, relacionades amb l'esquema d'integració temporal, pel que fa al tractament dels termes d'emmagatzematge de les equacions de govern i els fluxos de masa. Aquestes limitacions han motivat els següents nous desenvolupaments: una nova formulació que conserva la massa aplicada a les equacions de difusió en el medi porós i a les discontinuïtats, una nova corba de retenció de tipus exponencial que pren com a punt de partida la porosimetria en el cas del medi porós i la distribució d'obertures a les discontinuïtats, i, finalment, una nova llei constitutiva cohesiva-friccional per a les juntes que permet la modelació del tancament en descàrrega. (Español) Para mitigar las consecuencias del cambio climático se han propuesto diversas medidas, entre las cuales se encuentran el uso de energías renovables como la geotermia y el desarrollo de tecnologías como el almacenamiento de hidrógeno o CO2, que requieren la inyección de fluidos dentro de macizos rocosos fracturados (como los reservorios abandonados), lo cual supone un cambio en el estado tensional del mismo. Dicha alteración puede ocasionar el desencadenamiento de eventos micro-sísmicos mediante la reactivación de fallas geológicas o la creación de nuevas fracturas que en última instancia formarían caminos preferenciales para la filtración de los fluidos. Además, los reservorios abandonados contienen fluidos multifase con más de una especie que podrían reaccionar químicamente con los nuevos fluidos inyectados. Por lo tanto, la predicción precisa de las condiciones de operación requiere un análisis profundo de la problemática, así como disponer un software geomecánico avanzado capaz de evaluar la viabilidad y la seguridad de los posibles lugares de extracción o almacenamiento. En este contexto, el objetivo principal de esta tesis es el desarrollo de un modelo termo-hidro-mecánico (THM) acoplado multifase en un medio poroso fracturado mediante el método de los Elementos Finitos empleando elementos junta de espesor nulo con doble nodo para representar las discontinuidades. Las principales hipótesis del modelo son: la teoría de pequeñas deformaciones, un sistema compuesto por dos fases fluidas (líquida y gaseosa), dos especies (agua y gas seco) y una fase sólida, la fase gaseosa se comporta de acuerdo a la ley de los gases ideales y se considera la evaporación de la fase líquida. Las variables primarias son: desplazamientos, presiones de fase y temperatura. La formulación contempla: la ecuación de equilibrio, la ecuación de balance de masa de la especie agua, la ecuación de balance de masa de la especie gas y el balance de energía. La formulación de las discontinuidades considera las mismas hipótesis que el medio poroso y toma en cuenta un factor de reducción de los parámetros de la curva de retención basado en la apertura mecánica de la fractura. El modelo ha sido implementado y validado con ejemplos de verificación académicos en un código 3D de Elementos Finitos. Sin embargo, durante la fase de validación se han encontrado algunas limitaciones del al modelo, relacionadas con el esquema de integración temporal, en cuanto al tratamiento de los términos de almacenamiento de las ecuaciones de gobierno y los flujos másicos. Estas limitaciones han motivado los siguientes nuevos desarrollos: una nueva formulación de conservación de la masa aplicada a ecuaciones de difusión en el medio poroso y en las discontinuidades, una nueva curva de retención de tipo exponencial que toma como punto de partida la porosimetría en el caso del medio poroso y la distribución de aperturas en las discontinuidades, y, por último, una nueva ley constitutiva cohesivo-friccional para las juntas que permite la modelación del cierre en descarga.

Key conditions of evaluation included different plant species, growth media, exposure routes, environments, exposure durations, and types of nanomaterials, among others. Often, these tests are compared with bulk materials, ionic species, or even conventional/commercial formulations, which are at the opposite ends of the possible fate of pristine nanomaterials, especially of nutrient elements. As recently discussed by Vaidya et al., many of the initial studies in this space investigated the phytotoxicity of nanomaterials. (1) However, data began to accumulate demonstrating that not only were there instances where nanomaterials were not toxic but also that under many conditions, there were exposure scenarios where significant benefit to the plant was evident. As such, the focus of nanotechnology and plants began to shift toward applications in sustainable agriculture, initially to augment conventional agrochemicals such as fertilizers. Hence, investigations on the development and use of nanoenabled agrochemicals (nanofertilizers, nanopesticides, nanostimulants, and nanopolymer-based agrochemicals in general) increased dramatically, involving the use of nanomaterials in pristine forms, or as materials to encapsulate, coat, embed, or incorporate into fertilizer-nutrients, along with testing these materials at environmentally relevant application rates for crop production. These later studies have been conducted across a large number of countries and have demonstrated the promise of nanotechnology in sustainable agriculture. (2−7) Importantly, a major driver of this field of research is the general recognition that maintaining anything close to global food security in the coming decades for a rapidly increasing population in a changing climate is likely impossible with conventional agriculture and that a transformation of our food production, distribution, and storage systems is not only necessary but must begin immediately.With this background, studies on nanoscale sulfur under both greenhouse and field conditions have been conducted, elaborating novel mechanisms of sulfur effects leading to enhanced plant growth and yield. (8−10) In response to one of these studies, (9) Husted et al. 2024 have published a comment entitled "Nanotechnology papers with an agricultural focus are too frequently published with a superficial or poor understanding of basic plant and soil science - a critical comment to recent papers in ACS Nano." We appreciate our colleagues' enthusiasm for this field of research and strongly agree with the desire to advance the most impactful science, with the overall goal of bringing viable technologies to the field that can address this most wicked of problems, combatting global food insecurity in a changing climate. However, the authors raise several points that merit a response.The central thesis of Husted et al., as noted in their title, is that there are fundamental flaws in experimental design and results interpretation in the literature and specifically, in papers published in ACS Nano. A quick search reveals that as of October 2024, ACS Nano has published approximately 67 research papers in this space, with 60 of them being in the last 5 years. However, Husted et al. provide no evidence of what they describe as studies "weak in experimental design, rich in misunderstandings of basic plant and soil science" in any other paper in ACS Nano, other than their identified target of Wang et al. 2024, (9) nor do they provide such examples in what they refer to as any other "reputed and society-owned journal." Interestingly, the authors take the odd approach of laying blame on the journal editors (although one is not sure which journals are more prominent than ACS Nano), indicating that reviewers with "plant and soil competencies" are excluded from the review process.Husted et al. also seem particularly concerned about what they describe as the "sensational claim" of "boosted biomass productivity of 81%" reported in the greenhouse study of Wang et al., although the abstract from that paper clearly states that this increase was in the root biomass and that the shoot biomass was increased by 35–50% with the different forms of nanoscale sulfur relative to the nutrient in conventional forms. Although Wang et al. was a greenhouse experiment in a commercial potting mix with a focus on understanding mechanisms of nanoscale sulfur uptake, translocation and impact; we would like to point out a number of published field scale studies where similar amendments, including nanoscale sulfur in soil, increased the actual harvested yield of specific crops by 21–240%, including coated and uncoated nanoscale sulfur (the materials used in Wang et al). (3,7,8,11)Husted et al. also expressed concern over the design of the greenhouse experiment in Wang et al. 2024, specifically suggesting that the concentrations of commercial bulk sized S and ionic S (Na2SO4) used (100 and 200 ppm) were inappropriate and may cause potential phytotoxicity from excess S or Na+. However, as noted in our paper, phenotypic and biomass data show no evidence that the plants were stressed by these treatments. Moreover, a number of published studies (Table 1) have used much higher concentrations of S (up to 10,000 ppm) or Na+ (up to ∼1,400 ppm) in soil-grown plant experiments, and the same can be found for ionic S and Na+, showing either beneficial effects on plant growth or no phytotoxicity. While the dose of an element does make the poison, the environment can clearly modulate or even negate dose-inspired toxicity. For example, nutrients at high doses can be toxic in acidic soil but not in alkaline soil at the same dose (see for example, Watson et al., 2015 (12)). Clearly, there are several soil chemistry factors that modulate how plants respond to elements or nutrients at different doses. In addition, a subsequent study from our group on the effect of soil-applied S treatments at the same concentration had minimal effects on the soil bacterial and eukaryotic communities. (13) In addition, the background concentrations of S and Na in natural field soil have been reported to be as high as 0.1 wt % (1,000 ppm) for S (14) and 0.70 wt % (7000 ppm) as a median level for Na. (15) Another important line of evidence supporting the lack of toxicity of bulk S or Na2SO4 treatments in our study is the nutrient element profiles in the leaves, stems, and roots. Specifically, the levels of Na, which are related to plant stress, were not significantly changed by bulk S or ionic S treatments compared to the untreated control; a similar lack of change was noted for other nutrient elements, including K, P, Mn, Cu, B, Ca, and Si. Although subtle changes were found with Mg, Fe, or Zn contents in certain organs, over 90% of the elemental measurement results were unaffected by either bulk sulfur or ionic sulfur treatments, clearly demonstrating no subtle negative effect with treatment.Table 1.

(2016)PakchoiNa2S (1% w/w, or 10,000 ppm)45 daysMahar et al. (2016)Husted et al. also seem particularly concerned that we did not use field soil but instead used a commercially available potting mix. In fact, much specialty crop agriculture actually uses commercial potting mixes for crop growth, both to establish seedlings in the greenhouse prior to field transplanting and for full life cycle cultivation in greenhouses. Moreover, the use of model media ranging from hydroponics to sand to potting media is a common strategy used for decades in the hundreds (thousands?) of published studies in both nanotoxicology and nanoenabled agriculture. Although the analysis of this commercial potting mix was not provided in the paper, it is readily available for the product on the company Web site. (17) Importantly, the potting mix only has 30–100 ppm (mg/L) sulfur/sulfate, a level of S that is in fact considerably lower than most field soils, many of which are above 1000 ppm (mg/kg). (14) And perhaps last and most importantly, we again highlight the field studies noted above where levels of increased growth and yield similar to that of the current greenhouse study with commercial potting mix were published, including with the same materials used in our current study.Husted et al. noted that the elemental analysis of plant tissues for nutrients other than S was not provided. This was indeed an oversight on our part; the work is described in the methods in the paper. There were minimal changes in the content of other nutrients as a function of treatment, and our intent was to include this in the SI; we intend to publish a correction to ensure that those interested have access to this data. The authors also expressed concern over the effects of S treatments on photosynthesis, indicating that the chlorophyll content can vary without a concomitant change in photosynthetic rates. On that basis, they suggested that information on leaf conductance to show stress-induced reductions should have been provided in lieu of chlorophyll content. However, previous studies have shown that leaf conductance is even more susceptible to environmental influence, and thus, may not be the best indicator of stress response. (18−21) Specifically, the leaf conductance, or stomatal conductance, which is the rate at which water vapor exits and carbon dioxide enters the leaf through the stomata, is affected by several factors other than disease-induced stress, including environmental factors (light intensity, temperature, wind speed, CO2 concentration, etc.), water availability, plant hormones, and nutrient availability. (18−21) Nevertheless, our objective was to understand the growth and development of the plants under the studied conditions, not as a stress response. Compared with leaf conductance, chlorophyll content is more widely used as an indicator to assess plant growth and development since it plays a crucial and direct role in photosynthesis. Although there are different types of chlorophyll in plants, all of these pigments work together to capture light energy and transfer it to the photosynthetic reaction centers. Notably, the measurement in this regard was not a "simple pigment absorbance measurement" as suggested by Husted et al. A MultispeQ unit was used, which is a useful (and commonly used) hand-held device to nondestructively provide information on various photosynthetic parameters. This instrument combines the functionality of a hand-held fluorometer, a chlorophyll meter, and a benchtop spectrometer to measure linear electron flow (LEF), nonphotochemical quenching (NPQt), Quantum yield of Photosystem II (Phi2), ratio of incoming light that is lost via nonregulated processes (PhiNO), ratio of incoming light (excited electrons) that goes toward nonphotochemical quenching (PhiNPQ), photosystem I active centers, photosystem I open centers, photosystem I over reduced centers, photosystem I oxidized centers, and relative chlorophyll. Notably, all of these parameters were measured at each sampling point; because of the space limitation of the article, only the values that were significantly impacted by treatment were highlighted.Husted et al. also question the paper's two-photon microscopy data; however, the basis of this particular concern is elusive. As noted in the paper, we optimized and validated the two-photon microscopy measurement and laser wavelength using pure S materials. We took an orthogonal approach to evaluate plant response to S treatment, including in planta distribution of the element as a function of particle type. Specifically, two-photon microscopy enabled us to visualize the 3D distribution of the NPs in the plants. Previous applications of two-photon microscopy on NPs detection in plant tissues have been reported and our results were discussed in the context of some of those previous studies. (22) In Wang et al. 2024, (9) videos of NP distribution in the leaves and roots were provided. The authors are correct that autofluorescence is always a concern with plant tissues, but by optimizing our approach as noted above, the fluorescence signals of the NPs were clearly significantly different and observable, as shown in the study. This is the advantage of two-photon microscopy over the confocal microscopy, where an additional staining step is required, which may cause dye drop or release.Husted et al. also had some concerns about our time-dependent gene expression and metabolomics approach. The primary concern here seems to trace back to the concentration of S materials used; they believe that the control plants were unduly stressed, and as such, the mechanistic insights provided by the gene expression and metabolomic data were compromised. As noted above, we clearly demonstrated that the control plants were not stressed in this greenhouse study and noted that these controls produced quite ample yield in the parallel field study. (8) At this point, Husted et al. also make the statement that we actually induced S starvation in the plants. However, the dissolution data presented in the SI clearly indicate no major differences in sulfate release between the bulk and nanoscale S. Also, the elemental analysis data based on ICP-OES clearly shows no evidence of starvation, based on the comparison of relative S levels in the plants between the control and nano S treatments. Perhaps most befuddling is reconciling the concerns of Husted et al. that we somehow simultaneously induced both starvation and toxicity in the same plants with our conventional S treatments. Husted et al. also suggest that any transcriptomic data should be validated by the use of mutants and transgenics. Although this may be a good idea in certain instances, thousands of published studies utilizing gene expression data in the absence of mutants and transgenics demonstrate that this is far from a necessity.It is also rather surprising that Husted et al. described our studies on S as being observational and neither driven by hypothesis nor demonstrating mechanisms, indicating that we focus only on "sensational" observations. The validated increases in yield noted in the published field studies described above demonstrate the lack of sensationalism in our work. The work clearly hypothesized that nanoscale sulfur offers unique advantages, and this study was designed to evaluate that hypothesis; why this is unclear to Husted et al. is perplexing. And perhaps most confusing is their contention that the paper fails to demonstrate mechanisms of action. An orthogonal analytical approach with multiple types of nanoscale and conventional sulfur was used with methods including time-dependent gene expression, metabolomic, and element analyses; two-photon microscopy; and a range of agronomic and photosynthetic end points. The findings from these end points were then evaluated against sulfur type, dissolution profile, and concentration. How one could describe this experimental design as lacking in mechanistic insight seems quite odd, particularly when noting the second half of the title of the paper "··· An Orthogonal Mechanistic Investigation." Notably, several reviewers and the handling editor at ACS Nano were comfortable with this title.In closing, Husted et al. should be commended on highlighting the importance of this field of research; combatting rising global food insecurity in a changing climate is indeed an existential crisis and will be among the most significant challenges faced in the coming decades. But even more importantly, the scientific community does indeed have the expertise and tools to solve this problem; that is certain. There will be no silver bullet or single solution but instead a broad range of strategies and technologies spanning disciplines as diverse as nanotechnology, molecular biology, plant genetics, agronomy, plant biology, engineering, toxicology, and soil science that will drive the needed transformation in agriculture. All we need to do is work together and get this done.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorJason C.

(Royal Society of Chemistry) Nanoparticles (NP) have great potential in agriculture. For example, micronutrients have poor mobility in plants and poor availability in neutral soils, yet they play pivotal roles in root health. We investigated whether foliar sprays of micronutrient NP could affect plant health in disease infested soils. In the greenhouse, NP of AlO, CuO, FeO, MnO, NiO, and ZnO were sprayed on tomatoes and grown in soilless medium infested with the Fusarium wilt fungus. NP of CuO, MnO, or ZnO reduced disease ests. [area-under-the-disease-progress-curve (AUDPC)] by 31%, 28%, or 28%, resp., when compared to untreated controls. When NP of CuO, MnO, or ZnO, their bulked equiv., or their sulfate salts were compared to untreated eggplants and held in the greenhouse in soilless medium infested with the Verticillium wilt fungus, NP of CuO increased fresh wts. by 64%, reduced AUDPC values by 69%, and had 32% more Cu in the roots. These same amendments were sprayed onto the foliage of tomato and eggplant transplants and set in field plots in soil heavily infested with the Verticillium wilt fungus. Compared to untreated controls, yields of tomato were 33% or 31% greater with NP of CuO or the bulked MnO, resp. NP of CuO or ZnSO4 increased eggplant yields by 34% or 41% when compared to controls, resp. In vitro studies found NP of CuO were not inhibitory to the Fusarium wilt fungus, suggesting host defense was being manipulated. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC28Xht12ks7zL&md5=a9cd03276bd9998f939a2998b84e61f54Wang, C.; Liu, X.; Li, J.; Yue, L.; Yang, H.; Zou, H.; Wang, Z.; Xing, B.

As nearly half of the world's population headed to the polls this year, politics grabbed many of the headlines. But scientists and the natural world also managed to attract the public's attention. Here, Knowable Magazine takes a look at some of the most notable research-related events and discoveries of 2024, as well as a few studies and policy moves that we are eager to watch play out in the coming year.Sky showCelestial events encouraged many people to look skyward this year, with the Sun taking center stage.In April, millions of people stopped to watch the "Great North American Eclipse." Total solar eclipses happen every year or two, but this one provided the longest period of totality visible from land in over a decade, casting its shadow on a path smack over North America. The show was mostly of interest as a public spectacle, but citizen science projects also helped to collect data that should, for example, help to refine models of solar activity.Sky gazers were also stunned by auroras this year, thanks to a natural peak in solar activity caused by the 11-year cycle of the flipping of the Sun's magnetic poles. While this solar maximum doesn't look particularly strong in terms of the number of sunspots, "there were many more big flares than we would expect compared to the last cycle," says solar physicist Lyndsay Fletcher of the University of Glasgow. "It's quite exciting." Big flares in May created the biggest solar storm to reach the Earth in just over two decades, and more big flares brought bright lights to the skies in October.The last dramatic year for auroras was two cycles ago, in 2003. Back then, we didn't have pervasive cell phone cameras that could easily capture aurora colors, or social media sites like Facebook to spread the news. The show will continue: Forecasts show the solar maximum lasting into early 2025.Particles spewed from the Sun in May and October 2024 brought painterly skies to many latitudes, including Newport Pagnell in the United Kingdom, where this photo was taken. Red aurora are less common than green and occur when solar particles react with the atmosphere at higher altitudes, usually a mark of powerful solar activity.CREDIT: BRIAN TOMLINSON / FLICKRAlongside these solar fireworks, heliophysicists have some fresh data to look forward to: This Christmas Eve, NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission will get closer to the Sun than ever before, zooming by at 3.8 million miles from the surface. Such studies help astronomers to better understand the solar activity that leads to both auroras and space weather that can foul up electrical equipment.Total map of a brainIn October, scientists published the first complete map of a complex (though tiny) brain: that of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, one of the most-studied animals in biological research. The new "connectome" charts the wiring between 140,000 neurons, giving new insights into the roles of different brain regions.Scientists completed a major feat in 2024 — mapping all the neurons in a fruit fly brain.CREDIT: FLYWIRE PRINCETONThe human brain presents a far bigger challenge, with more than 80 billion neurons. But scientists have made a start. In May, researchers at Google revealed a 3D image of a tiny piece of human brain the size of half a grain of rice, containing about 16,000 neurons. That adds to an atlas of brain cell types created by the European Union's Human Brain Project last year.Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are helping to tackle these data-heavy tasks. Along with seeking to better understand fundamentals of how the brain works, such projects aim to solve mysteries of human mental illnesses or chart better paths to recovery after brain injury — and, along the way, might also help to improve AI.Hot EarthIt will come as no surprise that 2024 once again broke heat records, with the global average temperature topping 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average for the first time. High summer temperatures brought the planet's fourth and most widespread global coral bleaching event, affecting around 75 percent of global corals.In 2024, the global average temperature hit 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average for the first time.A warmer planet comes with extreme weather: Unusual heat in the Gulf of Mexico fed supercharged hurricanes, and Valencia, Spain, received more than a year's worth of rain in eight hours in October, causing deadly flooding. "The urgency is very tangible," says Andrew Satchwell, an energy economist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who works on climate policy.Global carbon dioxide emissions looked like they were starting to level off in 2023, but 2024 saw emissions bump upward again. The world is not on track to hit Paris Agreement targets that aim to limit warming. Instead, current policies and actions look set to see a world that's perhaps 2.7 degrees C warmer by 2100. Still, a few policy moves are starting to see traction. In the United States, for example, substantial pots of cash from the Inflation Reduction Act to decarbonize the country's energy started to flow in 2024. "I think we have seen a turn," says Satchwell. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Physical World Are we ready? Understanding just how big solar flares can get Physical World How the moon landings changed our view of the solar system Food & Environment How to overcome political polarization on climate change Efforts to track emissions of methane — an even more powerful though shorter-lived greenhouse gas — have revealed some nasty surprises. The largest inventory of methane emissions from US oil and gas production, for example, found them to be around three times the government estimate. A 2024 report highlighted a worrying bump up in large methane leaks detected, including a record-breaking blowout in Kazakhstan that lasted more than 6 months.Dealing with dementiaThis year, several researcher groups took big steps toward a simple and cheap blood test for Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for around two-thirds of the world's 55 million cases of dementia; the UK's Blood Biomarker Challenge hopes to add a routine blood test for dementia to the British public health care system within five years.More extensive diagnosis is key to tackling Alzheimer's, says Joshua Grill, director of the Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders at the University of California, Irvine. "We have to catch people early."The disease has no cure, but early-stage patients may benefit from new drugs that aim to slow its progression: Monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid protein, which builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, have made waves after a 20-year gap with no new drugs for the disease. "These positive trials were a big deal and very welcome," says Grill. Donanemab was approved in the United States this year, following lecanemab's approval in 2023.People with early-stage Alzheimer's may benefit from new drugs that aim to slow its progression.Such drugs might even prove effective at preventing the disease in high-risk people who haven't yet shown memory symptoms; trials are underway and the results should be out in four years, says Grill. Meanwhile, a 2024 Lancet report by a panel of dementia experts listed more than a dozen simple actions that research has shown can help to prevent or delay dementia, from using hearing aids to keeping cholesterol in check and exercising.Work on conditions that plague our later years is welcome as the global population ages dramatically. Between 2015 and 2050, the percentage of people over 60 years old is expected to nearly double, to 22 percent.Plastic pollution panicPlastics hit the spotlight this year as delegates to the United Nations tried to thrash out an international treaty to end plastic pollution. Although they failed to come to an agreement by December as originally planned, their work will continue next year."Personally, I remain hopeful; there are answers to this problem."— RICHARD THOMPSONThere are now an estimated eight gigatons of accumulated plastic on Earth — twice as much as the weight of all animal life. Plastic has leached into every corner of our lives, including our oceans, air, food, blood and mothers' milk. To support the treaty process, researchers modeled various plastic control policies and cataloged more than 16,000 plastic chemicals. More than 4,200 of these were found to be of concern because they were "persistent, bioaccumulative, mobile and/or toxic.""I would far rather we take the time needed to agree upon a strong treaty rather than settle for something of little substance," says Richard Thompson, a marine biologist at the University of Plymouth in England who studies plastics and is coleader of the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. "Personally, I remain hopeful; there are answers to this problem." The key, he says, is to dramatically reduce overall production, and make the remaining essential plastics "better by design" — with more recycled content, for example, and fewer toxic additives.Researchers also continue to seek out better ways to recycle or dispose of plastics (including finding fungi or bacteria to do the job), or to create more biodegradable versions.AI gets superchargedArtificial intelligence programs improved dramatically this year. The large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT have now surpassed people in many areas; some can achieve medal-worthy performance in the Math Olympiad and beat science PhDs in "Google-proof" tests of their own fields. The wave of developments caught the eye of the Nobel committee, with 2024 prizes in both physics and chemistry going to AI-related discoveries.As the technology advances, the electricity and water demand for the computing that powers AI has ballooned worryingly. "We're starting to see industrial-scale challenges for power supply," says data scientist Jakub Kraus from the Center for AI Policy in Washington, DC, who notes that big tech companies are now turning to nuclear power to fill their voracious energy needs.Despite their cleverness, chatbots continue to make serious mistakes, hallucinate false facts and perpetuate bias. Misuse can cause serious problems. AI-generated deepfakes made waves in this year's elections, for example when Joe Biden's voice was cloned to send out fake telemarketing calls urging Democrats not to vote in the primaries.The European Union's AI Act, which went into force in August, will begin to regulate AI providers and ensure good practices, such as transparency about how the systems work. "This is a good step forward," says Kraus. "Overall, there has not been a major AI policy package in the US. That might change."Votes cast for change2024 was a year of both communal action and global divides. Around the world, a record-setting number of voters headed to the polls: More than 75 nations, holding roughly half of the world's population, held national elections. The prevailing trend was for change: An ABC News analysis showed that in over 80 percent of democracies, the incumbent party lost seats or voter share.In elections in over 80 percent of democracies, the incumbent party lost seats or voter share in 2024.In this banner "super year" for elections, the entire concept of democracy is facing challenges. Voter turnout is going down, riots have become more common, election results are often disputed in courts and there are deep and troubling social divides, including in the United States."American democracy is in crisis," writes legal scholar Bertrall Ross of the University of Virginia in the 2024 Annual Review of Law and Social Science. "Both sides perceive every election as an existential threat to their ways of life."A river runs through itThe Paris Summer Olympics threw a spotlight on water pollution when athletes complained bitterly about the poor condition of the Seine, which was meant to be clean for the games. Paris is not alone. Rivers the world over increasingly face troubles from pollution, decreased water supply and more. An August series of reports from the UN Environment Program found worrying changes to the distribution, quantity and quality of river water globally: River flow, for example, has decreased in 402 basins worldwide.That may be a small fraction of the total 12,572 basins, but it's a fivefold increase over the number of dwindling rivers documented 15 years ago. And pollution makes things worse. A 2024 research paper concluded that out of 10,000 global river basins, around 1,000 face problems because of water scarcity, and that number more than doubles, to 2,500, when taking into account nitrogen pollution, mainly from agricultural runoff.Disease dangers spreadingThe mosquito-spread dengue virus raised alarms this year as cases hit record numbers. The Americas have been hardest hit, with more than 12 million cases — double the number from 2023 and three to four times the average over the past five years.The meteoric rise in dengue cases has infectious disease specialists scratching their heads.In October, the World Health Organization launched a plan to tackle the disease globally. Dengue is rarely fatal, says Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. But the meteoric rise in cases has infectious disease specialists scratching their heads. "I'm worried that we don't understand what's going on," Weaver says. Climate change might be part of the answer. Other mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile virus are on the rise in more temperate climes like Europe as the world warms.Meanwhile, mpox is also a pressing concern. The disease — previously known as monkey pox — was considered a disease largely spread to humans from other animals and endemic to central and west Africa. Then in 2022, cases spread by close person-to-person contact began popping up globally. In August 2024, an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was declared a public health emergency of international concern as a more virulent and deadly form of the virus — called clade 1 — started to spread, with the first known case appearing in the US in November. "This is pretty concerning," says Weaver.Five years after the outbreak of Covid-19, better plans for coping with pandemics remain elusive: Delegates to the World Health Organization disappointingly failed to come to an agreement for a treaty on pandemic responses this year. "I'm not very optimistic that international cooperation is going to improve a lot," says Weaver.Moon mattersSeveral craft are sent to the Moon every year, but 2024 brought a few special successes: Texas-based Intuitive Machines became the first company to put a lander on the Moon, and Japan became the fifth nation to do so. Excitingly, China's Chang'e-6 mission brought back the first rocks ever collected from the "far side" of the Moon, with signs of surprisingly young volcanism."After the Apollo missions, it was thought that the Moon was homogenous, and there was a feeling we'd 'been there done that.' We now know that's not true; it's much more rich and varied," says planetary geologist John Spray of the University of New Brunswick in Canada. "There's renewed excitement about what we can learn from the Moon." NASA is planning to send people back to explore, starting with an orbital mission in 2025.Stay in the KnowSign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter todayAliens ahoyThere's no proof of alien life as yet, but researchers keep looking. In July, NASA's Perseverance rover took photos of an intriguing rock on Mars with leopard-pattern spots that could be evidence of ancient microbes. "These spots are a big surprise," said David Flannery, an astrobiologist on the Perseverance science team, in a statement from NASA. "On Earth, these types of features in rocks are often associated with the fossilized record of microbes living in the subsurface."In May, astronomers spotted a planet, Gliese 12 b, that's only slightly larger and warmer than Earth and could be habitable — one of a handful of Earth-like worlds among the more than 5,000 exoplanets spotted over the past 30 years, and among the closest such finds to date at just 40 light-years away.Aliens may be top of mind for those captivated earlier this year by Netflix's mind-bending 2024 sci-fi hit "3 Body Problem," about an alien civilization threatened by chaotic climate caused by unpredictable orbits of its three suns. The story is kicked off by a real-life event: a mysterious radio signal picked up in 1977 that is often conjectured to be a sign of intelligent communication. Sadly, this August the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo published a report proposing a natural origin for the so-called WOW! signal: the sudden brightening of a cold hydrogen cloud.The show's 3 Body Problem, by the way, is also a real-life puzzle in physics: how to predict the interaction of three large objects like stars in which none dominates the orbits of the others. Mathematicians made progress this year in finding a less computationally intensive way of calculating the outcomes of these chaotic systems.

Biomacromolecules is proud to support efforts toward tackling diseases such as cancers. In this year's iteration of the World Cancer Day Collection (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/world-cancer-day-2024), the journal nominated breast cancer-tackling research on hydrogels based on elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) hydrogels as suitable biomaterials to develop more predictive breast cancer models, copolymer nanoparticles from original thermoresponsive block copolymers containing lipid-based segments which demonstrate increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis or necrosis induction in breast cancer cells, as well as immunological studies on biopolymer nonsmall-molecule inhibitor therapeutics. (5−7) World Microbiome Day 2024The scope of Biomacromolecules covers both naturally occurring biopolymers as well as synthetic polymers introduced to a biological environment. Celebrating World Microbiome Day 2024 (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/world-microbiome-day-2024), Biomacromolecules nominated articles showcasing: phage protection during cryopreservation, highlighting that a particular benefit of a polymeric cryopreservation formulation is that the polymers do not function as carbon sources for the phage hosts (bacteria) and hence do not interfere with post-thaw measurements; (8) a comprehensive analysis of the biodegradation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chemically modified PHB with different chemical and crystal structures in a soil environment; (9) and wound healing enhanced by a cross-linked macromolecular network based on gelatin loaded with metabolites from Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG that can accelerate wound healing by mitigating infections induced by pathogenic bacteria, accompanied by a reduction in the expression of key proinflammatory cytokines. (10) Peptide Conjugation and DeliveryPeptide conjugation methodology has become crucial in the fields of drug delivery, vaccine development, and biotechnology; from coacervates to nanoparticles, polymer research is driving forward methodology of drug delivery in leaps and bounds.Bioconjugate Chemistry and Biomacromolecules showcased the state of the art in peptide conjugation methodology in a joint Collection (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/peptide-delivery). We continue to welcome research at the interface between peptide conjugation and polymer science, focused on improving biocompatibility, stability, and functionality of bioconjugates toward improving therapeutic applications. (11) Some additional featured articles included demonstrations of complex coacervate core micelles as a promising strategy for efficient enzyme delivery systems after increasing the net charge of enzymes through genetic engineering, and cyclic peptide self-assembled nanotubes demonstrated to improve in vitro cell uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetic/biodistribution behavior compared to equivalent covalent molecular bottle-brush polymers. (12,13) 2024 Nobel Prizes in Medicine, Chemistry, and PhysicsFrom microRNAs to artificial intelligence in protein design and prediction, this was an exciting year for those who love biological chemistry. ACS Publications posted two Collections to celebrate both the 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/nobel-prize-medicine-2024), and the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, focused Protein Design and Prediction (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/nobel-prize-medicine-2024).Biomacromolecules is delighted to be able to support researchers from across nearly all these prize-winning fields and offered publications to the above Collections on bone regeneration through microRNA-based regulation, as well as computational hydrogel design, and a Perspective on the applications of machine learning to biopolymer data.

(American Chemical Society) The synthesis and living ring opening metathesis polymn. initiated with RuCl2(:CHPh)(PCy3)2 of three 7-oxanorbornene monomers contg. two tapered, I and resp. two conical II and III dendritic side groups is described. The monomer I and the corresponding polymer IV self-assemble in a cylindrical shape, while II and III self-assemble in spherical shapes. The polymn. of I proceeds via a cylindrical growing chain and occurs with the same rate const. regardless of the initial monomer concn. and the initial ratio between I and the initiator. The polymers resulting from II and III exhibit, depending on the d.p., spherical and cylindrical shapes. The shape change of the propagating macromols. that resulted from II and III were detected by the change in the rate const. of propagation. The implication of this kinetic method for the detection of shape change in the design of novel complex synthetic nanoscale functional macromols., e.g., liq. crystals, inspired from biol. is discussed. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3cXht1aitrY%253D&md5=6e2f7b1ff8727ebb3b2a3d5f84ebca594Percec, V.; Sahoo, D.

(American Chemical Society) This work presents a comprehensive anal. of the biodegrdn. of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chem. modified PHB with different chem. and crystal structures in a soil environment. A polymer modification reaction was performed during prepn. of the chem. modified PHB films, utilizing 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-hexane as a free-radical initiator and maleic anhydride. Films of neat PHB and chem. modified PHB were prepd. by extrusion and thermocompression. The biol. agent employed was natural mixed microflora in the form of garden soil. The course and extent of biodegrdn. of the films was investigated by applying various techniques, as follows: a respirometry test to det. the prodn. of carbon dioxide through microbial degrdn.; SEM (SEM); optical microscopy; fluorescence microscopy; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Next-generation sequencing was carried out to study the microbial community involved in biodegrdn. of the films. Findings from the respirometry test indicated that biodegrdn. of the extruded and chem. modified PHB followed a multistage (2-3) course, which varied according to the spatial distribution of amorphous and cryst. regions and their spherulitic morphol. SEM and polarized optical microscopy (POM) confirmed that the rate of biodegrdn. depended on the availability of the amorphous phase in the interspherulitic region and the width of the interlamellar region in the first stage, while dependence on the size of spherulites and thickness of spherulitic lamellae was evident in the second stage. X-ray diffraction revealed that orthorhombic α-form crystals with helical chain conformation degraded concurrently with β-form crystals with planar zigzag conformation. The nucleation of PHB crystals after 90 days of biodegrdn. was identified by DSC and POM, a phenomenon which impeded biodegrdn. Fluorescence microscopy evidenced that the crystal structure of PHB affected the physiol. behavior of soil microorganisms in contact with the surfaces of the films. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXitVynurjJ&md5=97522dedf8a0320f182edd92109bcfe510Han, Y.; Yin, Z.; Wang, Y.; Jiang, Y.; Chen, J.; Miao, Z.; He, F.; Cheng, R.; Tan, L.; Li, K.

Mieke; Borst, Jan WillemBiomacromolecules (2022), 23 (3), 1195-1204CODEN: BOMAF6; ISSN:1525-7797. (American Chemical Society) Encapsulation of proteins can have advantages for their protection, stability, and delivery purposes. One of the options to encapsulate proteins is to incorporate them in complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms). This can easily be achieved by mixing aq. solns. of the protein and an oppositely charged neutral-hydrophilic diblock copolymer. However, protein-contg. C3Ms often suffer from salt-inducible disintegration due to the low charge d. of proteins. The aim of this study is to improve the salt stability of protein-contg. C3Ms by increasing the net charge of the protein by tagging it with a charged polypeptide. As a model protein, we used CotA laccase and generated variants with 10, 20, 30, and 40 glutamic acids attached at the C-terminus of CotA using genetic engineering. Micelles were obtained by mixing the five CotA variants with poly(N-methyl-2-vinyl-pyridinium)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PM2VP128-b-PEO477) at pH 10.8. Hydrodynamic radii of the micelles of approx. 31, 27, and 23 nm for native CotA, CotA-E20, and CotA-E40, resp., were detd. using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The encapsulation efficiency was not affected using enzymes with a polyglutamic acid tail but resulted in more micelles with a smaller no. of enzyme mols. per micelle. Furthermore, it was shown that the addn. of a polyglutamic acid tail to CotA indeed resulted in improved salt stability of enzyme-contg. C3Ms. Interestingly, the polyglutamic acid CotA variants showed an enhanced enzyme activity. This study demonstrates that increasing the net charge of enzymes through genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve the practical applicability of C3Ms as enzyme delivery systems. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38Xht1yrsLw%253D&md5=9d2c5ccf68e96917916a97e79653147413Kerr, A.; Sagita, E.; Mansfield, E.

(American Chemical Society) A review. This Perspective outlines recent progress and future directions for using machine learning (ML), a data-driven method, to address crit. questions in the design, synthesis, processing, and characterization of biomacromols. The achievement of these tasks requires the navigation of vast and complex chem. and biol. spaces, difficult to accomplish with reasonable speed. Using modern algorithms and supercomputers, quantum physics methods are able to examine systems contg. a few hundred interacting species and det. the probability of finding them in a particular region of phase space, thereby anticipating their properties. Likewise, modern approaches in chem. and biomol. simulation, supported by high performance computing, have culminated in producing data sets of escalating size and intrinsically high complexity. Hence, using ML to ext. relevant information from these fields is of paramount importance to advance our understanding of chem. and biomol. systems. At the heart of ML approaches lie statistical algorithms, which by evaluating a portion of a given data set, identify, learn, and manipulate the underlying rules that govern the whole data set. The assembly of a quality model to represent the data followed by the predictions and elimination of error sources are the key steps in ML. In addn. to a growing infrastructure of ML tools to address complex problems, an increasing no. of aspects related to our understanding of the fundamental properties of biomacromols. are exposed to ML. These fields, including those residing at the interface of polymer science and biol. (i.e., structure detn., de novo design, folding, and dynamics), strive to adopt and take advantage of the transformative power offered by approaches in the ML domain, which clearly has the potential of accelerating research in the field of biomacromols. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38XivF2msLY%253D&md5=743ea583851ace62a6511d8fe297fa4bCited By Click to copy section linkSection link copied!This article has not yet been cited by other publications.Download PDFFiguresReferences Get e-AlertsGet e-AlertsBiomacromoleculesCite this: Biomacromolecules 2024, XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXXClick to copy citationCitation copied!https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.4c01672Published December 16, 2024 Publication History Received 29 November 2024Published online 16 December 2024Published 2024 by American Chemical Society.

A New Lesson from BiologyPercec, Virgil; Holerca, Marian N.Biomacromolecules (2000), 1 (1), 6-16CODEN: BOMAF6; ISSN:1525-7797. (American Chemical Society) The synthesis and living ring opening metathesis polymn. initiated with RuCl2(:CHPh)(PCy3)2 of three 7-oxanorbornene monomers contg. two tapered, I and resp. two conical II and III dendritic side groups is described. The monomer I and the corresponding polymer IV self-assemble in a cylindrical shape, while II and III self-assemble in spherical shapes. The polymn. of I proceeds via a cylindrical growing chain and occurs with the same rate const. regardless of the initial monomer concn. and the initial ratio between I and the initiator. The polymers resulting from II and III exhibit, depending on the d.p., spherical and cylindrical shapes. The shape change of the propagating macromols. that resulted from II and III were detected by the change in the rate const. of propagation. The implication of this kinetic method for the detection of shape change in the design of novel complex synthetic nanoscale functional macromols., e.g., liq. crystals, inspired from biol. is discussed. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3cXht1aitrY%253D&md5=6e2f7b1ff8727ebb3b2a3d5f84ebca594Percec, V.; Sahoo, D.

Recent advances within bionanotechnology offer a range of exciting possibilities to improve NUE through the synthesis and tailoring of nanoparticles (NPs) with properties that might be helpful in designing the next generation of more efficient fertilizers. This includes, for example, soil-based nanofertilizers with improved accessibility to plants, as well as foliar nanofertilizers with low risk of foliar scorching, programmed release properties, and more intricate advantages such as stimulating photosynthesis through increased light harvesting, improving electron transport between the photosystems, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. (1,2) Advances within this area must develop based on interdisciplinary projects bridging plant and soil science with nanotechnology. This is a challenging task, as real advances, for the benefit of crop production and environmental health, can only be made if projects are developed based on strengths within both disciplines. Furthermore, the true impact of the science in these publications will only be realized if researchers also consider the logistics and economics of manufacturing, transport, and application, as well as the wide range of safety issues related to the use of nanoparticles in agriculture.We have previously shown that many nanotechnology-based papers focusing on agriculture are weak in experimental design, are rich in misunderstandings of basic plant and soil science, and are using unrealistic nutrient-application regimes so that the impacts of engineered nanomaterials are misinterpreted or overstated by authors. (3−6) In too many cases, it seems as if journal editors have not ensured that reviewers with both nanotechnology as well as plant and soil science competences have been recruited for the review panels.As a group of experienced plant and soil scientists, we are concerned, as we observe that an increasing amount of these papers manage to get published in reputed and society-owned journals with high impact factors, including ACS Nano, implying a threat to scientific integrity and hampering true developments within nanoenabled agriculture. The acute nature of the problem is underlined by a recent paper published in ACS Nano by Wang et al., (7) where it is claimed that application of sulfur nanoparticles to soil boosted biomass productivity up to 81% (!), while in contrast, no stimulatory effects were observed when S was applied as elemental sulfur or ionic sulfate. Wang et al. (7) attempted to explain their observations by an ability of the sulfur nanoparticles to specifically interact with and stimulate distinct sulfur dependent metabolic pathways, while at the same time stimulating quantum yield, and electron flow between the photosystems. We have used our plant and soil science competences to take a deep dive into the paper. Here we use it as an illustrative case to show how fundamental claims in publications are unsupported by the data provided due to an inadequate experimental design and a superficial interpretation of the underlying plant and soil science. Finally, we provide a range of criteria that should be considered in future papers on nanoenabled agriculture.The Growth Experiments Are FlawedClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The ability to promote biomass productivity by 70–80% in the roots and 35–50% in the shoots of unstressed plants using nanotechnology is on the verge of being sensational and will attract the attention of a wide audience across scientific disciplines including plant and soil science. In the current study, it is noted that the yield responses are measured relative to an untreated control grown in a synthetic fertilized potting mix, and it is also noted that sulfur fertilization with elemental sulfur leads to either no effect or even a growth depression relative to the control. These observations are remarkable and require a deep dive into the experimental design and results obtained.The first issue is that the growing medium has been very poorly described. Although repeatedly described by the authors as "soil", the plants were actually not grown in a natural field soil, but were grown in an artificial potting medium consisting of sphagnum peat moss (75–85%), perlite, limestone, and wetting agent (Pro-Mix BX, Premier Hort Tech, Quakertown, PA, https://www.pthorticulture.com/). Because little information is provided on the growing medium, it is not possible to know what limiting factors (if any) the plants were exposed to, including the sulfur status of the growing medium relative to plant requirements. This is an unusual situation given that the authors state that one of the driving factors for this research is that "many agricultural soils have become S deficient", yet this study does not use soil nor is it known what the S status of the growing medium was. Knowledge of the growing medium and its properties is critical in understanding the subsequent response of plants to the imposed treatments. It is difficult to assess what was done as details are vague, and it is not clear if changes in plant-available S within the "soil" are examined over time or even examined in a meaningful or accurate manner. For example, in the Supporting Information, it is stated that changes in plant-available S were examined using 0.01 M CaCl2 extraction, DTPA extraction, and DI extraction. However, it seems that the only data presented are for "deionized water suspensions" (Figure S6), and without knowledge of how these measurements were conducted (such as the soil: extractant ratio), the results cannot be interpreted in a meaningful manner.Without taking the above issues into account, readers must assume that all essential plant nutrients were present in sufficient quantities to support growth in the commercial potting mix used, although this information is not provided. Furthermore, an elemental profiling of leaf tissue containing the essential plant nutrients is also not provided, and consequently, it is not possible to evaluate if plants experienced any nutrient deficiency or any imbalance between nutrients, which is a major shortcoming for interpretation of the marked responses observed. In many plant species without nutrient deficiency stress, the shoot to root dry weight ratio usually ranges between 4 and 6, and may drop down to 1 or 2 when plants suffer from e.g. N or P deficiency. (8) In the first experiment, the shoot to root dry weight ratio was almost 1 for all S-treated plants and about 1.3 in the case of the control plants on day 16, strongly indicating a nutrient imbalance in the plants used for the experiments. The S concentrations in leaf tissue after 16 days (Experiment 1) were within the range from 0.5–0.8% S in dry matter (DM) for the plants without S supply. This is well above the critical threshold concentration for deficiency of 0.2% S in DM, (9) which indicates that none of the plants were S deficient, but rather had ample S for their requirements. It is remarkable that addition of elemental S further increased the leaf tissue concentration to 1.1–1.2% S in DM, with this being an extremely high value for well-nourished tomato plants, whereas the nano S treatments only increased tissue S marginally (insignificantly for one of the treatments). The results with the elemental S are surprising because oxidation of elemental S with a larger particle size is expected to be much slower than that of the nano S products. (10) Additionally, in the growth medium having a rather low pH (5.2 to 6.2), biological S oxidation is expected to be very low because biological S oxidation is much slower at low pH than that at alkaline soil pH. (11) However, surprisingly, the elemental S product with larger particle size increased leaf S concentration of plants from 0.6 to almost 1.2% S in DM within 4 days in a soil with rather low S oxidizing capacity, as evidenced from extractable S data in Figure S6.The above large differences in plant S acquisition and accumulation were also observed despite the dissolution in "soil" apparently being similar for elemental S and the nano-S treatments (Figure S6), although there was no indication that ultrafiltration of extracts was used to ensure that nano-S particles were separated before measurement of S in solution by ICP-OES. A substantial increase in shoot biomass was observed for both nanotreatments, whereas the elemental S treatment strikingly reduced biomass productivity. Thus, based on the information given, the reader must infer that the elemental S treatment caused S toxicity or in other ways stressed the plants, but these important aspects were not discussed by the authors. Rather, the ratio of the nano treatments relative to the elemental S treatment was mentioned to highlight the effects of the nano treatments, but we contend that this approach does not make sense.In Experiment 2, the experimental period was prolonged to 35 days, and an inorganic sulfate treatment (added as Na2SO4) was included. In addition, a treatment with half dosage compared with Experiment 1 was included. Both treatments with elemental and ionic S resulted in a similar or decreased biomass relative to the control, whereas the nano treatments increased biomass productivity. This observation is remarkable and calls for a closer inspection: if the elemental S or ionic S treatments leads to a biomass reduction relative to the control, this indicates that stress is induced in these treatments. If S was indeed limiting, these two treatments must either be similar to the control or stimulate growth. Rather, the observation that both treatments were the same or decrease growth relative to the control indicates an error within the fertilization scheme, perhaps due to an excessive S (and/or Na toxicity as sulfate was added as a sodium salt) application as indicated above.Figure S9 from Experiment 2 seems to support the idea that plants in both the elemental S and ionic sulfate treatment were indeed stressed by overfertilization. The plants shown in the photo appear generally highly heterogeneous, and the elemental S and ionic S treatments are clearly wilted and stressed in a dose-dependent manner (higher applications of S decreasing plant growth). Overall, the quality of these plants shown in the image is poor and prevents any meaningful interpretation in terms of comparisons of, e.g., biomass productivity, biochemical, and transcriptomic analyses.No evidence was provided documenting that the applied nanoparticles were taken up by the plants and the reported responses in Figure 1 could very well be caused by a changed availability and uptake of one or more essential nutrients from the soil. Based on the plant growth responses presented, the application of 200 mg S Ll–1 soil (and even 100 mg S l–1) has clearly been excessive and induced disturbances to plant growth. Fertilization with S in a large surplus will unavoidably affect the anion/cation balance of the roots, and thereby the uptake mechanisms of other essential plant nutrients. (12) Evidently, the addition of S as Na2SO4 at the given levels was a questionable choice, as evident from the photo in Figure S9. These plants are in effect dying due to salinity stress and/or S toxicity. It is unsuitable to include data from plant material of this quality in scientific papers.We consider the growth conditions described above to be a fundamental flaw, which essentially invalidates all of the conclusions drawn based on plant material produced in Experiments 1 and 2. Thus, we suggest it would be premature and unsupported by data to claim a nanospecific response with the information provided as the treatments and controls were flawed.The Claimed Effects of S Treatments on Photosynthesis Are UnjustifiedClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Chlorophyll, quantum yield, and linear electron flow (LEF) were analyzed using a portable PhotosynQ meter from PhotosynQ Inc. on the severely stressed plant material shown in Figure S9. The portable device estimates the chlorophyll concentration based on absorbance measurements at two distinct wavelengths (655 and 950 nm), at which stress-induced pigments like anthocyanins also absorb. Furthermore, the chlorophyll concentration is often used as an approximate estimate for N (sometimes also for S, Fe, etc.) concentrations in plants, but it is impossible to use chlorophyll levels to estimate photosynthesis (CO2 assimilation rates) in plants. (13) It is well-known that the chlorophyll content can vary without a concomitant change in photosynthetic rates and simple pigment absorbance measurement will not provide information on stress-induced reductions in leaf conductance. (14)Wang et al. also reported that LEF was stimulated by the nano treatments; that quantum yield was stimulated in some of them and that the elemental S and ionic S treatments were either similar or reduced relative to the control. (7) Remarkable observations of this kind must be supported by supplementary experimentation, not least because it is stated that quantum yield in the nano S treatment was improved by a massive 120% (!) relative to the control. Are we looking at a hormetic response or stress alleviation, or is it really related to an increased efficiency of light harvesting for "soil"-grown plants caused by nano S?Giraldo et al. have shown that carbon nanotubes (5 by 100 nm) are able to localize to the envelope membrane of isolated chloroplasts and increase photosynthetic rates by a factor of 3 through improved photon capture and electron transport within the photosystems. (1) Likewise, other studies have confirmed that 4 nm carbon dots are able to stimulate LEF, photosynthesis, and growth in a dose-dependent manner when fed to the root system of hydroponically grown plants, supposedly by converting damaging UV-A light into photosynthetically active light. (15) Several other papers support that photosynthesis may be stimulated by various NPs to increase light conversion and photoelectron transfer. (16) However, in the current paper, there lacks a detailed discussion of the remarkable findings related to light harvesting and electron transport, and it remains unexplained how up to 65 nm spherical nano S, or more likely clusters of those, should be acquired from "soil" by the root system, translocated, cross cell walls of mesophyll tissue and the chloroplast envelope barrier, and eventually become installed in the thylakoids to capture and transfer energy more efficiently than the control. Furthermore, the current study lacks imaging evidence and the authors refer to their previous work, also published in ACS Nano, where 2-photon confocal imaging was used to show transport of nano S from root and deposition in the shoot of soil-grown tomato. (17) However, a close inspection of the images provided in that study is far from convincing, as there seems to be a complete overlap with strong autofluorescence from the cells and there is no inclusion of appropriate controls (see Figure 1 in Supporting Information), which prevents a meaningful interpretation. The images in Figure 1 and videos in the SI, showing some unusual structures below the stomata, cannot document the existence of nano S in the leaf tissue. It is common in confocal microscopy to observe "unusual" structures such as this in leaf tissue. Also, in Wang et al., we note that the plants included in the study were of a questionable quality (see e.g. Figure 2) with heterogeneous and wilted appearance in the controls. (17)Interpretation of Transcription and Metabolome Data Appears AnecdotalClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Plant material from Experiment 1 was used for transcription and metabolome analyses with the aim of tracing responses of the S assimilation pathway to the treatments, which is problematic given the fact that the controls were flawed. Moreover, the procedures for quality control and the inclusion of housekeeping genes have not been presented clearly. The description appears to be rather anecdotal and goes beyond what the data can support; importantly, there is no functional validation for the observations made. Thus, the resulting discussion is speculative and unfortunately presents quite a few inconsistencies, which makes it difficult to follow. Below we highlight a few of these inconsistencies.Expression of the ST2.1 sulfate transporter appears to be induced by the nano S treatment at day 16 only but is downregulated in the elemental S treatment. Thus, apparently nano S leads to induction of a S starvation response whereas this is not the case for elemental S. How can this make sense given the tissue S concentrations listed in Figure 3? Likewise, the primary sulfate assimilation step (ATP-sulfurylase) seems to be unaffected by the treatments. Why is this crucial step unaffected? The same sort of questions arise when studying the expression of S assimilation genes in Figure 5, which all makes very little sense without validation.Transcription data are often prone to responses caused by stress and a range of secondary processes. Thus, it is important to note that expression of a given gene cannot be interpreted as a response at, e.g., the sulfate transporter or assimilatory pathway levels, without being backed up by parallel analyses showing data at the protein level and/or using mutants/transgenics for a functional validation. As a consequence, we conclude that it is impossible to extract solid evidence from the transcriptomic analysis using the data presented.ConclusionsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Nanotechnology has the potential to provide attractive solutions for agriculture, but it is critical that unexpected or even dramatic results are supported by solid experimentation to back up the findings. It is critical that the experimental designs are carefully planned, executed, and interpreted. In this respect, it is important that the soil and plant materials used in experiments are homogeneous between treatments, of good quality, and thoroughly characterized to allow for meaningful interpretation. There is a strong need that studies investigating the impact of NPs on plants should be hypothesis-driven and should focus on providing mechanistic insights rather than just observing effects of a given treatment of soil and plants with a nanoformulation.In drawing conclusions about the benefits of any novel nanofertilizer and its likely benefits for global agricultural production, several key points need to be considered. The vigor and nutritional health of plants in the positive control (fertilized) are critical in comparison with those of the plants exposed to a given nanoproduct. Similarly, the use of appropriate growth media that accurately represent the conditions in unfertilized natural soils is essential (i.e., good negative controls) if any novel nanofertilizer claims to offer significant nutritional benefits.Modes of nanofertilizer application to soil also need to be considered in the experimental design, as many fine-powdered materials present health issues related to human exposure, which mean that spreading and incorporation into soil is unlikely to occur as a dispersed nanopowder. In the particular case, nanosulfur represents an explosion risk in both manufacture and handling, which should be considered. Finally, the costs of manufacturing and environmental safety of any nanomaterials need to be considered and discussed.Papers on nanoenabled agriculture should occasionally move outside the nano silo in order to publish plant-based work in well-established plant and soil science journals. This will allow reviewers with in-depth expertise within the plant and soil disciplines to evaluate the work and ensure that the appropriate quality standards and perspectives are in place.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorSøren Husted - Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2020-1902; Email: [email protected]AuthorsIsmail Cakmak - Sabanci University, Faculty of Engineering & Natural Sciences, 34956 Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3183-5524Jan Kofod Schjoerring - Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2852-3298Hans Lambers - School of Biological Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6009, AustraliaPeter M.

(Nature Publishing Group) The interface between plant organelles and non-biol. nanostructures has the potential to impart organelles with new and enhanced functions. Here, we show that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) passively transport and irreversibly localize within the lipid envelope of extd. plant chloroplasts, promote over three times higher photosynthetic activity than that of controls, and enhance max. electron transport rates. The SWNT-chloroplast assemblies also enable higher rates of leaf electron transport in vivo through a mechanism consistent with augmented photoabsorption. Concns. of reactive oxygen species inside extd. chloroplasts are significantly suppressed by delivering poly(acrylic acid)-nanoceria or SWNT-nanoceria complexes. Moreover, we show that SWNTs enable near-IR fluorescence monitoring of nitric oxide both ex vivo and in vivo, thus demonstrating that a plant can be augmented to function as a photonic chem. sensor.

(Nature Research) Abstr.: Current approaches for nanomaterial delivery in plants are unable to target specific subcellular compartments with high precision, limiting our ability to engineer plant function. We demonstrate a nanoscale platform that targets and delivers nanomaterials with biochems. to plant photosynthetic organelles (chloroplasts) using a guiding peptide recognition motif. Quantum dot (QD) fluorescence emission in a low background window allows confocal microscopy imaging and quant. detection by elemental anal. in plant cells and organelles. QD functionalization with cyclodextrin mol. baskets enables loading and delivery of diverse chems., and nanoparticle coating with a rationally designed and conserved guiding peptide targets their delivery to chloroplasts. Peptide biorecognition provides high delivery efficiency and specificity of QD with chem. cargoes to chloroplasts in plant cells in vivo (74.6 ± 10.8%) and more specific tunable changes of chloroplast redox function than chems. alone. Targeted delivery of nanomaterials with chem. cargoes guided by biorecognition motifs has a broad range of nanotechnol. applications in plant biol. and bioengineering, nanoparticle-plant interactions, and nano-enabled agriculture. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3cXosVOhu7c%253D&md5=c5d8527f42186c570a3ef288f588fc0d3Kopittke, P.

(Royal Society of Chemistry) A review. Food prodn. must increase markedly to feed the growing human population, but this needs to be achieved while simultaneously reducing adverse environmental impacts. In this regard, there is increasing interest in the use of nanomaterials as fertilizers for improving plant mineral nutrition. In the present review, we examine the ability of nanomaterials to supply a range of nutrients, with most focus given to recent research on phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn). Some studies have demonstrated that nanomaterials can indeed be more effective than conventional fertilizers, esp. by acting as a slow release source. However, other studies have found that nanomaterials have the same effectiveness, or are even less effective, than conventional fertilizers. Thus, ongoing investigation is required to understand the conditions under which the use of nanomaterials increases efficiency. We also note that there are a comparatively large no. of stu
