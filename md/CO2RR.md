Green and sustainable electrosynthesis of urea at ambient conditions through co-reduction of CO2 and NO3− (CR-CO2/NO3−) is regarded as a new avenue for nitrogen fertilizer production, however, the lack of novel electrocatalysts capable of selective C-N coupling hinders its wide application. Herein we reported a TiNx catalyst (TiN/TiN0.3) prepared by facile electric explosion method for electrocatalytic urea synthesis via CR-CO2/NO3−. The derived catalyst with porous nanostructure and specific active phase (TiN0.3) is more conductive for efficient C-N coupling. Consequently, a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 43.1 ± 3.1 % and a urea formation rate as high as 1488 ± 95 μg h−1 mgcat−1 were reached over the TiNx electrode, outperforming most of the reported CR-CO2/NO3− systems toward urea synthesis. In-situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and isotope-labeling experiments demonstrated the details about electrochemical coupling processes. The simulation study suggested that the TiN0.3 (1 0 0) facet facilitates the electroreduction of CO2 and NO3−, and decreases the energy barrier for generation of the key intermediates (*CO/*NH2), thus leading to the selective formation of urea. This work accomplished highly efficient electrochemical CR-CO2/NO3− toward nitrogen fertilizer production over a novel TiNx electrocatalyst for the target process.

Abstract Silicon-based porous nanocomposites are considered promising as electrode materials for the photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, the high cost of raw materials and tedious processing for building nanostructures may not be conducive to large-scale industrial applications in terms of cost. Herein, we would like to introduce a porous structure prepared by Fenton reaction-assisted chemical etching of low-cost commercial silicon powder in the mixed solution of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen peroxide. These porous particles are further decorated with silver nanoparticles to explore their feasibility for photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. As shown by experimental results, this silicon-based nanocomposite is capable of catalyzing the conversion of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide. The low cost of commercial silicon powder (~$3000/ton) compared with that of silicon wafers also renders this method potential and feasible for large-scale production of silicon-based porous materials.

Carbon dioxide, a "greenhouse gas" resulted from industrial fossil fuels combustion, is a major driver of global warming and climate change. Several works have been pursued to reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The most attractive and feasible approach to address this issue and maintain sustainable energy development for generations is carbon capture and storage or sequestration (CCS) via electrochemical reduction. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) is an integrated step of CO2 capture and electrochemical CO2 conversion, using water and electricity to convert CO2 into fuels and valuable chemicals, especially formic acid. Multiple benefits of CO2 Electrochemical conversion include the ability to regulate reaction rates or selectivity finely through the applied voltage, modularity of electrolytic cells that allows extensive scalability, and effective integration with intermittent renewable energy sources. The efficiency of ECO2R processes can be improved through (i) electrode structure and modification, (ii) electrolytic cell (reactor), (iii) electrolyte selection and pH control, and (iv) operating conditions (pressure and temperature). However, finding suitable electrodes with high selectivity for formic acid formation remains the biggest challenge at the fundamental level. This article provides an overview of recent research on ECO2R electrodes, focusing on the application of different types of integrated electrodes (e.g., metals, metal oxides, alloys) and the effect of adding promoters or/and carbon supports. The synergistic effect of different materials, promoters, and carbon supports in the electrodes is essential for the enhancement of the ECO2R performance.

Climate change as an effect of global warming is an environmental problem that is currently a concern of many parties. The global warming is mainly triggered by emission of CO2 into the atmosphere due to human activities such as usage of fossil fuels as the energy source. Therefore, the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy as well as technology to capture and utilize the CO2 are highly necessary. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to produce various products, such as formic acid has advantages, due to mild reaction condition, the process is controllable, use minimal chemicals, and the application is relatively easy to scale-up. Formic acid has potential as a source of hydrogen carrier and can replace fossil-based fuels. Products from electroreduction of CO2 depend on electrons transferred during the reaction, which are generated by the configuration of electrode/electrocatalyst, applied potential, and electrolyte. In addition, the type of reactor system or electrolytic cell also plays an important role in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Carbon-based materials have potential as electrocatalysts for electroreduction of CO2 because of the porous structure, acid-base resistance, stability at high temperature, abundant availability in nature, and environmentally friendly. This mini review will discuss the electroreduction of CO2 in various electrochemical reactor systems using carbon-based electrocatalyst to produce formic acid using the SWOT analysis method.

Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2ER) coupled with water oxidation (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) presents a promising solution for effectively mitigating global warming. However, this process is compromised by the sluggish OER, which yields only undesirable O2. Here, we couple selective CO2ER with partial ethylene glycol oxidation (EGO) to concurrently produce formate in both half-reactions. The enhancement of active sites and optimization of formate selectivity are the principal objectives during the design of both electrodes. For CO2ER, redox stabilization of Sn-based cathodes is investigated via Pb doping, thus ultimately improving the Faradaic efficiency from 68% to ∼89%. To replace OER with EGO, we employed CuO@Ni(OH)2 on copper foam, reducing the applied potential by 200 mV at 50 mA/cm2. Finally, an EGO-coupled CO2 electrolyzer achieves 10 mA/cm2 at an overall cell voltage 180 mV lower than that of a conventional CO2 electrolyzer. This study showcases the integration of divergent electrochemical processes for concurrent electrosynthesis without precious metals to achieve cost-effective and sustainable formate production from CO2 and plastic waste.

The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to chemicals and fuels is expected to be a key sustainability technology. Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction technologies are challenged by several factors, including the limited solubility of carbon dioxide in aqueous electrolyte as well as the difficulty in utilizing polymer electrolytes. These considerations have driven systems designs to incorporate gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to bring the electrocatalyst in contact with both a gaseous reactant/product stream as well as a liquid electrolyte. GDE optimization typically results from manual tuning by select experts. Automated preparation and operation of GDE cells could be a watershed for the systematic study of, and ultimately the development of a materials acceleration platform (MAP) for, catalyst discovery and system optimization. Toward this end, we present the automated GDE (AutoGDE) testing system. Given a catalyst-coated GDE, AutoGDE automates the insertion of the GDE into an electrochemical cell, the liquid and gas handling, the quantification of gaseous reaction products via online mass spectroscopy, and the archiving of the liquid electrolyte for subsequent analysis.

The structural devise of photocatalytic materials are closely related to the separation of photogenerated carriers and the transport of charge, which is crucial to enhance the performance of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Here, a photocatalyst (CdS-SV@Co@NCNT) has been successfully prepared by growing cadmium sulfide nanoparticles with sulfur vacancies on N-doped carbon nanotubes through a simple solvothermal method. The intrinsic electronic structure is regulated by sulfur vacancies to promote photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, a larger specific surface area of Co@NCNT could expose more reaction sites and shorten the transfer distance of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the combination with Co@NCNT could effectively suppress the photocorrosion of CdS. The possible photocatalytic CO2RR path is further speculated by in-situ infrared test results, in which CO2 molecules adsorbed on sulfur vacancies preferentially generate important intermediate COOH*, which is then reduced to CO and CH4. Therefore, it exhibits a high CO yield of 263.3 μmol·g−1·h−1 and trace of CH4 while showing excellent stability. This research provides a novel idea for designing the photocatalysts with highly active and stability for CO2RR.

The effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction of bromantane synthesis by reductive amination using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent has been studied. A nonlinear dependence of the yield of the target product on the ratio of gases was observed. It was found that, depending on the conditions, carbon dioxide could both decrease and increase the yield of bromantane.

This study aims at identifying the carbon dioxide reduction (CDR) potential of large-scale and multi-purpose afforestation/reforestation at the global level with special emphasis on the Mid-Latitude Region (MLR). Applying a combined remote sensing/GIS approach coupled with biophysical forest and disturbance modeling under various climate change scenarios, we identify potential afforestation locations, inter-alia on abandoned agricultural land and on areas burnt from wild land fires. With the help of IIASA&#8217;s biophysical global forestry model (G4M), we calculate the associated land-based CDR potentials through carbon sequestration in afforested biomass and through climate risk-resilient and sustainable forest management dedicated to the supply of bioenergy plants coupled with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) facilities. Finally, three promising scenarios have been identified including I) afforestation; II) reforestation; and III) BECCS. In all scenarios, priority is put on sustainable forest management and nature/biodiversity conservation. Forest modeling results have been combined with recent data sets which have been overlayed in order to provide a unique basis to estimate the land-based CDR technologies&#8217; potential to mitigate climate change and contribute to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement. In the case of afforestation, preliminary results indicate a total potential afforestation area greater than 1 billion ha. &#160;The largest area potential for afforestation have been identified in the USA. Given the higher productivity (combined with large area available), Brazil is the country with the highest total CDR potential of close to 500 MtC/yr.

This study evaluates the electrochemical performance of Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC10) cathodes infiltrated with bimetallic Ni-Co and Ni-Cu alloy electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction in solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs). The electrochemical reduction performance of SOECs with cathodes infiltrated with Ni-Co and Ni-Cu alloys were compared to the performance of SOECs having cathodes infiltrated with Ni, Co, and Cu. Electrochemical performance was evaluated at 750, 800, and 850°C. Cells with Co, Ni0.50Co0.50, Ni0.75Co0.25, and Ni infiltrated cathodes displayed a relatively similar CO2 electroreduction performance; however, SOECs having Co infiltrated cathodes had a slightly better catalytic performance towards CO2 reduction as demonstrated by their lower polarization resistance (Rp) values of 8.54, 4.03, and 1.25 Ω·cm2 when measured under open circuit voltage (OCV) at 750, 800, and 850°C, respectively. Cells having Co, Ni0.50Co0.50, Ni0.75Co0.25, and Ni infiltrated cathodes showed a stable long-term CO2 electroreduction performance with Faradaic efficiency values approaching 100% when tested under 0.20 A·cm−2 for 48 hours and at 750°C. Results indicate that SOECs with Ni infiltrated cathodes possessed better short- and long-term CO2 electroreduction performance compared to SOECs featuring cathodes infiltrated with Cu, Ni0.25Cu0.75, and Ni0.50Cu0.50. Increasing Ni percentage within the Ni-Cu alloy structure had a positive impact on the electrochemical performance as cells with Ni0.50Cu0.50 infiltrated cathodes showed relatively close voltage values to those of cells with Ni infiltrated cathodes during short-term galvanostatic tests. Although the SOEC with Ni0.50Cu0.50 infiltrated cathode experienced performance degradation throughout the long-term test period, it demonstrated better electroreduction performance having Faradaic efficiency values approaching 100% compared to cells with Cu and Ni0.25Cu0.75 infiltrated cathodes when evaluated under 0.20 A·cm−2 for 48 hours and at 750°C.

Effective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate under mild conditions helps mitigate the energy crisis but requires the use of high-performance catalysts. The addition of a third metal to the binary metal catalyst may further promote the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate. Herein, we provided a co-electrodeposition method to grow CuSnBi catalysts on pretreated copper foam and discussed the effects of both pH value and molar ratio of metal ions (Cu2+, Sn2+, and Bi3+) in the electrodeposition solution on the electrocatalytic performance of CO2 to HCOO−. When the pH value of the electrodeposition solution was 8.5 and the molar ratio of Cu2+, Sn2+, and Bi3+ was 1:1:1, the electrode showed the highest FEHCOO− of 91.79% and the formate partial current density of 36.6 mA·cm−2 at −1.12 VRHE. Furthermore, the electrode kept stable for 20 h at −1.12 VRHE, and FEHCOO− was always beyond 85% during the electrolysis process, which is excellent compared to the previously reported ternary metal catalytic electrodes. This work highlights the vital impact of changes (pH value and molar ratio of metal ions) in electrodeposition liquid on catalytic electrodes and their catalytic performance, and refreshing the electrolyte is essential to maintain the activity and selectivity during the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOO−.

The reduction of carbon dioxide to produce valuable chemicals offers a sustainable approach towards achieving carbon neutralization. However, the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (ECO2RR) using clean electricity faces challenges in terms of high product faradaic efficiency (FE), current density, and stability. In this study, we prepared a S–Bi2O3 nanosheets (NS) catalyst through in-situ structural reconstruction. The S–Bi2O3 NS catalyst exhibited a peak formate FE of 92.05 % at −0.9 V and a high formate formation rate of 497.80 μmol h−1 cm−2 at −1.3 V. The significant improvement in selectivity and activity is attributed to the sulfur modification on Bi2O3 NS catalyst. The sulfur doping enhances the dissociation of water into H* species, facilitating the formation of HCOO* intermediate and promoting formate production. This work presents a simple and effective strategy for developing highly selective Bi-based electrocatalysts for efficient formate production.

Oxygen-containing species have been demonstrated to play a key role in facilitating electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR), particularly in enhancing the selectivity towards multi-carbon (C2+) products. However, the underlying promotion mechanism is still under debate, which greatly limits the rational optimization of the catalytic performance of CO2RR. Herein, taking CO2 and O2 co-electrolysis over Cu as the prototype, we successfully clarified how O2 boosts CO2RR from a new perspective by employing comprehensive theoretical simulations. Our results demonstrated that O2 in feed gas can be rapidly reduced into *OH, leading to the partial oxidation of Cu surface under reduction conditions. Surface *OH accelerates the formation of quasi-specifically adsorbed K+ due to the electrostatic interaction between *OH and K+ ions, which significantly increases the concentration of K+ near the Cu surface. These quasi-specifically adsorbed K+ ions can not only lower the C–C coupling barriers but also promote the hydrogenation of CO2 to improve the CO yield rate, which are responsible for the remarkably enhanced efficiency of C2+ products. During the whole process, O2 co-electrolysis plays an indispensable role in stabilizing surface *OH. This mechanism can be also adopted to understand the effect of high pH of electrolyte and residual O in oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) on the catalytic efficiency towards C2+ products. Therefore, our work provides new insights into strategies for improving C2+ products on the Cu-based catalysts, i.e., maintaining partial oxidation of surface under reduction conditions.

InnoSepra’s project, “Transformational Sorbent Materials for a Substantial Reduction in the Energy Requirement for Direct Air Capture of CO2,” utilized computational tools, materials characterization, and lab scale testing to optimize previously identified materials to determine their performance under direct air capture conditions. InnoSepra utilized the test results to determine the energy required for regeneration and to develop a high-level process design/analysis to demonstrate the application of developed materials for direct air capture which could be utilized for future techno-economic and life-cycle analyses to fully assess the potential of the materials for direct air capture. InnoSepra also updated the State Point Data Table and completed the environmental, health, and safety (EH&S) Risk Assessment. The overall objective of this project was to demonstrate that the proposed transformational materials can lead to a substantial reduction in the energy requirement for direct capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from air compared to current state-of-the-art direct air capture processes. An assessment of the production of large quantities of the proposed materials was made for a potential future commercial implementation of these materials for direct air capture. The ultimate goals of the Project were to confirm the expected performance at the lab scale and to provide sufficient data to enable the development of a preliminary technical analysis to confirm the projected energy savings of at least 50% compared to current state-of-the-art technologies for direct air capture based on absorption and adsorption. During the project execution, InnoSepra demonstrated that Direct Air Capture with physical sorbents developed/identified during this project has the potential for a significant reduction in the energy required for capture and, when fully developed, the technology has the potential for an energy requirement below 4 GJ/MT of CO2. The starting TRL for major unit operations, moisture removal, and CO2 capture, was 2, and the end of the project TRL for these unit operations was 3-4. The technology uses near-commercial sorbents and the production of these materials for commercial-scale demonstration can be done in 2-3 years. The materials also have a long life (>5 years) and pose little or no EH&S issues.

We present a computational investigation combining machine learning forcefields (ML-FF) and DFT calculations into the potential of amorphous copper (Cu) surfaces towards electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) to one-carbon (C1) and two-carbon (C2) products. The “on-the-fly” ML-FF developed for Cu replicate DFT energies and structures, offering a computationally efficient tool for simulating amorphous Cu systems. These ML-FFs were used to generate atomistic amorphous models of bulk and surfaces, and the amorphous bulk Cu exhibited slightly higher stability than crystalline Cu. The amorphous Cu surface provide a wider range of Cu coordination sites (5-9) compared to crystalline Cu, which offered a multitude of active centres for CO2 adsorption. Some of the amorphous surfaces investigated in this study spontaneously activated CO2, evidenced by the stable chemisorption, highlighting their potential for efficient CO2 conversion. The intermediates formed during the eCO2R on amorphous Cu surfaces are stabilized compared to crystalline surfaces, leading to a lower overpotentials, and improved faradaic efficiency. This study demonstrates for the first time theoretically, the potential of amorphous Cu-based catalysts towards sustainable CO2 conversion and paves the way for further research and development in this promising field.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) coupled with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an energy-intensive process that generates low-value oxygen, limiting its industrial application. To overcome this limitation, here we report a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system that combines CO2ER with glucose electrooxidation (GEOR) to simultaneously produce formate using bismuth subcarbonate and carbon nanotube hybrid (BOC-CNT) and nickel cobalt oxide decorated on carbon fiber paper (NCO-CFP) as the cathode and anode catalysts, respectively. The BOC-CNT catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic performance for CO2ER to formate, affording a high FEHCOO- of 97.9 % with current density of 360 mA cm−2 at −0.77 V vs. RHE (-580 mV overpotential), and the NCO-CFP catalyst achieved GEOR at 0.99 V (vs. RHE) with FEHCOO- >98 %. The coupled CO2ER//GEOR MEA exhibits a low onset cell voltage of 1.20 V and reaches ultrahigh apparent Faraday efficiency of formate (>190 %) in a wide range from 1.8 to 2.4 V, achieving ∼ 33.3 % energy savings compared to CO2ER//OER with a high formate yield of 0.92 mol g-1h−1 at 100 mA cm−2. Besides, all generated formate can be collected from the electrolyte on the anode side due to the spontaneous migration of formate under electric field, thus reducing cross-contamination from CO2 and alkaline electrolytes. In addition, the coupled CO2ER//GEOR system exhibited good electrocatalytic stability for at least 32 h. This strategy provides an innovative and promising approach for the co-electrolytic transformation of biomass derivatives and CO2 to formate.
