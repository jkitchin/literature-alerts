Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with metallocyclophane units and organic linkers have found application as electrocatalytic systems. Nevertheless, the majority of linkers within COFs necessitate intricate design and synthesis. Conversely, the potential utilization of natural building blocks in COF construction remains largely unexplored. In this study, we constructed a natural COF (CoPc-EA-COF) by employing a natural phenolic molecule (ellagic acid (EA)) as the linker and Co-hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (CoPc) as blocks. This framework serves as an electrocatalyst for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The incorporation of EA units imparts the CoPc-EA-COF with elevated electronic conductivity, enhanced CO2 binding affinity, and superior reductive capacity compared to the controlled COF lacking EA units. The CoPc-EA-COF demonstrated enhanced performance in the ORR, as evidenced by a half-wave potential of 0.80 V. Moreover, it showcased elevated activity and selectivity in the CO2RR, achieving a maximum CO faradic efficiency of 97.32 % at − 0.8 V, along with turnover frequency (TOF) values reaching 2092 h−1. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of EA units facilitated the generation of OOH* and COOH* species, which are pivotal in the rate-determining stages of both ORR and CO2RR processes. The contribution of EA units significantly bolstered the overall catalytic activity.

This work employs density functional theory (DFT) to scrutinize the catalytic efficacy of nano nickel (Ni) clusters supported by graphitic carbon nitride (Nin@g-C3N4, where n ranges from 1 to 6) in the context of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Structural examination revealed that Nin@g-C3N4 possesses a substantial binding energy (-1.63 eV to -7.72 eV), confirming the structural stability of the catalyst in the CO2RR. Electronic structure analysis revealed a pronounced orbital overlap near the Fermi level between the 3d orbital of Ni atoms and the 2p orbital of adjacent cavity nitrogen atoms in Nin@g-C3N4. Further insights are gleaned from the calculations of the Bader charge and energy band, indicating significant charge transfer and band gap alteration, suggesting enhanced conductivity due to Ni doping on g-C3N4. The catalytic performance in the CO2RR is predominantly influenced by the size of the doped Ni clusters. The Ni4@g-C3N4 cluster demonstrated optimal efficiency in producing formic acid (HCOOH) with a limiting potential of -0.12 V. In contrast, the Ni5@g-C3N4 cluster excels in methane (CH4) formation, with a limiting potential of -0.35 V. Additionally, these catalysts exhibit marked inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction, further underscoring their potential in CO2RR applications.

In view of the low utilization rate of by-product in limestone-gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization process, a method of catalytic reduction of SO2 to elemental sulfur was proposed. In this work, supported iron catalyst using activated coke as supporter was prepared and characterized. Moreover, the performance of SO2 reduction using CO as reducing agent at various Fe loadings, temperatures, gaseous hourly space velocities and CO/SO2 molar ratios was studied. Research shows that, compared with other metals, the highest catalytic activity is achieved over Fe-based catalyst. The iron sulfide is the main active component during the catalytic reduction reaction, hence the catalyst needs to be presulfided before use. The micropores of activated coke become more abundant after loading Fe, whereas excessive increase of Fe loading may bloke the mesopores and weaken the catalytic activity. Higher reaction temperature, lower GHSV and a stoichiometric molar ratio are conducive to the improvement of SO2 conversion and S yield. The catalytic performance at lower temperatures was further improved by loading Co. When the Co loading is 4 wt.%, the SO2 conversion rate reaches 90.9% at 400 °C because loading Co enhances the redox performance of the catalyst surface. The findings are instructive for the development of cost-effective carbon-based catalysts for resource recovery of sulfur.

The escalating demand for Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) schemes to mitigate CO2 emissions has propelled research into more efficient methods of CO2 conversion, such as the production of formic acid. While traditional approaches often require harsh operating conditions and substantial energy inputs, photocatalysis offers a promising alternative by harnessing CO2, water, and light for formic acid production. This study evaluates the performance and reaction kinetics of CO2 capture and conversion to formic acid using an integrated membrane contactor and photocatalytic process. Investigation into various CO2 absorbents and reduction catalysts reveals that TEA achieves a CO2 loading of 0.957 moles of CO2/mole of solvent, while NaOH achieves 0.75 moles of CO2/mole of solvent over a 4-hour operation period. Subsequent photoreduction of CO2 results in formic acid concentration of 15.89 ppm using ZnO and 10.16 ppm using TiO2 within the same 4-hour operation period at a gas flow rate of 800 ml/min. The rate of CO2 photoreduction to formic acid emerges as the limiting factor in this integrated process, indicating a need for further optimization. Key parameters identified for optimal performance include a UV source of 500 W, a medium pH of 10, and a catalyst loading of 0.5 g/L. This study contributes to the advancement of CCU technologies by demonstrating the feasibility of integrating CO2 capture and photoreduction using membrane contactors and photocatalytic systems, paving the way for sustainable formic acid production.

Abstract The effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable chemical fuels relies significantly on the donation of multiple electrons. Its efficiency is closely linked to both the density and lifetime of excited charge carriers. In this study, a hybrid catalyst system comprising covalently bonded InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) and Re‐complexes is showcased. The electronic band alignment between the QDs and the Re‐complexes is revealed to dominate the multi‐electron transfer process for photocatalytic conversion to methane (CH 4 ). Notably, the size of the QDs is found to be a determining parameter. Among the three QD sizes investigated, transient absorption spectroscopy studies unveil that rapid multi‐electron transfer from the QDs to the Re‐catalyst occurs in smaller QDs (2.3 nm) due to the substantial driving force. Consequently, the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 is significantly enhanced with a turnover number of 6, corresponding to the overall apparent quantum yield of ≈1%. This research underscores the possibilities of engineering multi‐electron transfer by manipulating the electronic band alignment within a catalytic system. This can serve as a guide for optimizing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

Abstract Renewable electricity‐powered nitrate/carbon dioxide co‐reduction reaction toward urea production paves an attractive alternative to industrial urea processes and offers a clean on‐site approach to closing the global nitrogen cycle. However, its large‐scale implantation is severely impeded by challenging C‐N coupling and requires electrocatalysts with high activity/selectivity. Here, cobalt‐nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) is proposed as a catalyst electrode to boost yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward urea electrosynthesis with enhanced C‐N coupling. Such Co NPs@C renders superb urea‐producing activity with a high FE reaching 54.3% and a urea yield of 2217.5 μg h –1 mg cat. –1 , much superior to the Co NPs and C nanosheet counterparts, and meanwhile shows strong stability. The Co NPs@C affords rich catalytically active sites, fast reactants diffusion, and sufficient catalytic surfaces‐electrolyte contacts with favored charge and ion transfer efficiencies. The theoretical calculations reveal that the high‐rate formation of *CO and *NH 2 intermediates is crucial for facilitating urea synthesis. This article is protected by copyright.

The iron industry is the largest energy-consuming manufacturing sector in the world, emitting 4–5% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2). The development of iron-based systems for CO2 capture and storage could effectively contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. A wide set of different iron oxides, such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and wüstite (Fe(1−y)O) could in fact be employed for CO2 capture at room temperature and pressure upon an investigation of their capturing properties. In order to achieve the most functional iron oxide form for CO2 capture, starting from Fe2O3, a reducing agent such as hydrogen (H2) or carbon monoxide (CO) can be employed. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art and recent advances on the different iron oxide materials employed, as well as on their reduction reactions with H2 and CO.

The reduction of CO2 is known to promote increased alkene yields from alkane dehydrogenations when the reactions are cocatalyzed. The mechanism of this promotion is not understood in the context of catalyst active-site environments because CO2 is amphoteric, and even general aspects of the chemistry, including the significance of competing side reactions, differ significantly across catalysts. Atomically dispersed chromium cations stabilized in highly siliceous MFI zeolite are shown here to enable the study of the role of parallel CO2 reduction during ethylene-selective ethane dehydrogenation. Based on infrared spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy data interpreted through calculations using density functional theory (DFT), the synthesized catalyst contains atomically dispersed Cr cations stabilized by silanol nests in micropores. Reactor studies show that cofeeding CO2 increases stable ethylene-selective ethane dehydrogenation rates over a wide range of partial pressures. Operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectra indicate that during reaction at 650 °C the Cr cations maintain a nominal 2+ charge and a total Cr–O coordination number of approximately 2. However, CO2 reduction induces a change, correlated with the CO2 partial pressure, in the population of two distinct Cr–O scattering paths. This indicates that the promotional effect of parallel CO2 reduction can be attributed to a subtle change in Cr–O bond lengths in the local coordination environment of the active site. These insights are made possible by simultaneously fitting multiple EXAFS spectra recorded in different reaction conditions; this novel procedure is expected to be generally applicable for interpreting operando catalysis EXAFS data.

The preparation of formic acid by direct reduction of carbon dioxide is an important basis for the future chemical industry and is of great significance. Due to the serious shortage of highly active and selective electrocatalysts leading to the development of direct reduction of carbon dioxide is limited. Herein the target catalysts with high CO2RR activity and selectivity were identified by integrating DFT calculations and high‐throughput screening and by using graphdiyne (GDY) supported metal oxides quantum dots (QDs) as the ideal model. It is theoretically predicted that GDY supported indium oxide QDs (i.e., InOx/GDY) is a new heterostructure electrocatalyst candidate with optimal CO2RR performance. The interfacial electronic strong interactions effectively regulate the surface charge distribution of QDs and affect the adsorption/desorption behavior of HCOO* intermediate during CO2RR to achieve highly efficient CO2 conversion. Based on the predicted composition and structure, we synthesized the advanced catalytic system, and demonstrates superior CO2‐to‐HCOOH conversion performance. The study presents an effective strategy for rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts to promote green chemical production.

Aviation contributes to anthropogenic climate change by emitting both carbon dioxide (CO2) and non-CO2 emissions through the combustion of fossil fuels. One approach to reduce the climate impact of aviation is the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel. Two distinct technological options are presently under consideration for the implementation of hydrogen in aviation: hydrogen fuel cell architectures and the direct combustion of hydrogen. In this study, a hydrogen demand model is developed that considers anticipated advancements in liquid hydrogen aircraft technologies, forecasted aviation demand, and aircraft startup and retirement cycles. The analysis indicates that global demand for liquid hydrogen in aviation could potentially reach 17 million tons by 2050, leading to a 9% reduction in CO2 emissions from global aviation. Thus, the total potential of hydrogen in aviation extends beyond this, considering that the total market share of hydrogen aircraft on suitable routes in the model is projected to be only 27% in 2050 due to aircraft retirement cycles. Additionally, it is shown, that achieving the potential demand for hydrogen in aviation depends on specific market prices. With anticipated declines in current production costs, hydrogen fuel costs would need to reach about 70 EUR/MWh by 2050 to fulfill full demand in aviation, assuming biofuels provide the cheapest option for decarbonization alongside hydrogen. If e-fuels are the sole option for decarbonization alongside hydrogen, which is the more probable scenario, the entire hydrogen demand potential in aviation would be satisfied according to this study's estimates at significantly higher hydrogen prices, approximately 180 EUR/MWh.

CO2 can be involved in the CFB gasification process as one of the gasifying agents and be reduced to CO. In this paper, the feasibility of using CFB gasification process to reduce CO2 was investigated by using a bench-scale CFB gasifier. The effect of gasifying agent parameters including the CO2 substitution for N2, the O2 concentration and O2/C were studied. The result of experiments was compared with the chemical equilibrium calculations. The experimental result shows that the reduction of CO2 can be realized in CFB gasification, and the yield of CO in O2/CO2 atmosphere is higher than that that in air atmosphere. When the O2 concentration is 30%, the CO2 conversion reached the maximum of 0.017 Nm3(CO2)/kg(coal). However, the conversion of CO2 is limited by temperature and char reactivity at higher CO2 concentration. The gradual increase in CO2 yield with increasing O2/C suggests that at approximate temperature, the increase in O2/C enhances the oxidation of C and CO. When O2/C is greater than 0.45, the gasification results reach equilibrium. Under other conditions, the gasification results differ from the chemical equilibrium significantly. This is due to the change in the dominant reaction of the gasification process from the combustion reactions to the Boudouard reaction.
