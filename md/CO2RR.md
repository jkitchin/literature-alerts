Catalysts involving post‐transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post‐transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)‐doped‐copper (Cu)‐based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm‐2. Ex‐situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S‐S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S‐S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low‐cost catalyst (Cu) with a non‐metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.

Abstract To prevent global warming, various technologies are being developed to suppress carbon dioxide emissions. Nanobubbles are useful in various industrial fields. Carbon dioxide capture technology was studied using the property of activating the reaction of nanobubbles. In this study, carbon dioxide capture was attempted using nanobubble generation tubes based on the friction principle. The world has paid attention to carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) to inhibit and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which are known as the main cause of global warming. The problem is that the new process that utilizes carbon dioxide must consume less energy and resources than existing alternative processes. To address this problem, research was conducted on the possibility of dissolving carbon dioxide in large quantities at low power consumption using a nanobubble generation system and real-time chemical reactions in this study. In addition, a mass dissolution system was constructed, and real-time neutralization was verified through the reactions of nanobubble carbon dioxide with ammonia water (NH 4 OH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ) solution.

Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into formic acid has been demonstratedas an efficient approach for closing the carbon cycle. Here, we boost the intrinsicactivity of the Bi-based electrocatalyst through the synergy of enhanced chargetransfer and mass transport process in the electrochemical reactions by generating anatomic disorder in the crystal lattices. The amorphous Bi-based quantum dots (a-BiQDs) serve as promising electrocatalysts toward formate production in a widepotential range with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and energy efficiency (EE) in boththe conventional H-cell and flow-cell. The maximum FEs of 94.44% and 98.89% areachieved at the potential of -1.0 V vs. RHE in the H-cell and flow-cell, respectively.Furthermore, long-term stability of more than 900 hours is demonstrated in a two-electrode configuration. Combined molecular dynamics and first-principle calculationsascribe the remarkable activity toward formate production to synergistically acceleratedmass transport and charge transfer kinetics .

Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.

With ever-increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and commitments to limit global temperatures to less than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, the need for versatile, low-cost carbon dioxide capture technologies is paramount. Electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide separation systems promise low energetics, modular scalability and ease of implementation, with direct integration to renewable energy for net-negative carbon dioxide operations. For these systems to be cost-competitive, key factors around their operation, stability and scaling need to be addressed. Energy penalties associated with redox-active species transport, gas transport and bubble formation limit the volumetric productivity and scaling potential due to their cost and footprint. Here we highlight the importance of engineering approaches towards enhancing the performance of redox-active electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide capture systems to enable their widespread implementation. This Perspective discusses electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide capture systems, which can offer lower energetics than standard thermal methods, with modular scalability. New integrated configurations can further reduce costs and improve unit productivity, while further engineering of existing cell designs will enable more rapid implementation.

Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2β12) supported by β12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2β12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2β12 and Ag2β12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2β12 and Ag2β12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2β12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2β12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2β12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.

In this paper, a cleaner pyrolysis strategy combining microwave heating, catalyst and carbon dioxide was explored for converting biomass components into higher quality products. Catalytic pyrolysis was more favorable for the decomposition and conversion of complex biomass structures. For furfural residue pyrolysis, potassium sulfate contained in sample served as the main catalytic component. Potassium sulfate promoted the increase of phenols in bio-oil. Notably, carbon dioxide atmosphere promoted the decomposition of substances and exerted a significant effect on biomass pyrolysis, which increased bio-oil yield and declined gas yield. When the pyrolysis atmosphere was changed from nitrogen to carbon dioxide, the ID/IG ratio decreased from 1.07 to 0.74, indicating that carbon dioxide decreased defect structure in biochar. Carbon dioxide enriched the porous structure and surface roughness of biochar. Also, carbon dioxide as a carrier gas was found to be more effective than nitrogen in improving the heating values of biochar and the acidity of bio-oil under carbon dioxide was lower than that under nitrogen, which was conducive to the subsequent utilization of biochar and bio-oil. Carbon dioxide promoted the production of alcohols, alkenes, and alkanes in bio-oil. Beneficially, the interaction of cellulose and lignin inhibited the release of hydrogen chloride. At last, this study also provides insights into the mechanism of catalyst and CO2 on biomass microwave pyrolysis.

Control over product selectivity of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a crucial challenge for the sustainable production of carbon-based chemical feedstocks. In this regard, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising materials due to their tunable coordination environments, which could enable tailored catalytic activities and selectivities, as well as new insights into structure-activity relationships. However, direct evidence for selectivity control via systematic tuning of the SAC coordination environment is scarce. In this work, we have synthesized two differently coordinated Bi SACs anchored to the same host material (carbon black) and characterized their CO2RR activities and selectivities. We find that oxophilic, oxygen-coordinated Bi atoms produce HCOOH, while nitrogen-coordinated Bi atoms generate CO. Importantly, use of the same support material assured that alternation of the coordination environment is the dominant factor for controlling the CO2RR product selectivity. Overall, this work demonstrates the structure-activity relationship of Bi SACs, which can be utilized to establish control over CO2RR product distributions, and highlights the promise for engineering atomic coordination environments of SACs to tune reaction pathways.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction (CO2R) holds the potential to reduce the costs of solar fuel production by integrating CO2 utilization and light harvesting within one integrated device. However, the CO2R selectivity on the photocathode is limited by the lack of catalytic active sites and competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction. On the other hand, serious parasitic light absorption occurs on the front-side-illuminated photocathode due to the poor light transmittance of CO2R cocatalyst films, resulting in extremely low photocurrent density at the CO2R equilibrium potential. This paper describes the design and fabrication of a photocathode consisting of crystal phase-modulated Ag nanocrystal cocatalysts integrated on illumination-reaction decoupled heterojunction silicon (Si) substrate for the selective and efficient conversion of CO2. Ag nanocrystals containing unconventional hexagonal close-packed phases accelerate the charge transfer process in CO2R reaction, exhibiting excellent catalytic performance. Heterojunction Si substrate decouples light absorption from the CO2R catalyst layer, preventing the parasitic light absorption. The obtained photocathode exhibits a carbon monoxide (CO) Faradaic efficiency (FE) higher than 90% in a wide potential range, with the maximum FE reaching up to 97.4% at -0.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. At the CO2/CO equilibrium potential, a CO partial photocurrent density of -2.7 mA cm-2 with a CO FE of 96.5% is achieved in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte on this photocathode, surpassing the expensive benchmark Au-based PEC CO2R system.

An energy crisis and significant anthropogenic CO2 emissions as a result of rising fossil fuel consumption have caused a rapid increase in global temperature. One of the best solutions to these two issues is thought to be the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added carbon-containing products. In this aspect, the main challenges mainly include the photocatalytic mechanism, reaction activity, and product selectivity, especially in ambiguous reaction pathways and product selectivity, an unclear charge transfer mechanism, and an overestimate of product yield. Therefore, in this perspective, we attempt to exhibit the discussion and in-depth analysis of the possible reaction pathways and product selectivity, the specific charge transfer mechanism, and the origin of carbon-containing products in phtocatalytic CO2 reduction. Besides, the fundamentals for photocatalytic CO2 reduction are also illustrated. Finally, the state-of-the-art challenges and perspectives in CO2 photoreduction are highlighted and discussed in detail. This perspective is expected to evoke more research attention for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added products.

Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) is an appealing solution for converting carbon dioxide into higher-value products. However, CO2R in aqueous electrolytes suffers from poor selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction that is dominant on semiconductor surfaces in aqueous electrolytes. We demonstrate that functionalizing gold/p-type gallium nitride devices with a film derived from diphenyliodonium triflate suppresses hydrogen generation from 90% to 18%. As a result, we observe increases in the Faradaic efficiency and partial current density for carbon monoxide of 50% and 3-fold, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate through optical absorption measurements that the molecular film employed herein, regardless of thickness, does not affect the photocathode’s light absorption. Altogether, this study provides a rigorous platform for elucidating the catalytic structure–property relationships to enable engineering of active, stable, and selective materials for photoelectrochemical CO2R.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to valuable C2+ liquid fuels and oxygenates, such as ethanol and propanol, is a promising strategy to minimize the carbon footprint and store renewable electricity. In this study, we investigate the CO2RR on electrodeposited Cu-Ag nanostructures obtained using a green choline chloride and urea deep eutectic solvent (DES). We show that Cu-Ag nanostructured electrocatalysts with tunable composition, loadings, and size can be simply prepared in one step, without adding other additives or surfactant agents. We investigate the intrinsic activity and selectivity of the CO2RR by determining the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) using lead underpotential deposition (UPD). The analysis of the partial current densities normalized by the ECSA shows that the addition of Ag on electrodeposited Cu primarily suppresses the production of hydrogen and methane with respect to Cu nanostructures. At the same time, the production of carbon monoxide (CO) slightly increases but, the partial current of the total C2+ products does not considerably increase. Despite that the production rate of C2+ is similar on Cu and CuAg, the addition of Ag enhances the formation of alcohols and oxygenates over ethylene, in line with previous reports. We highlight the potential of metal electrodeposition from DES as a sustainable and inexpensive strategy for the development of bimetallic Cu-based nanocatalysts towards CO2RR.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds the promise of both overcoming the greenhouse effect and synthesizing a wealth of chemicals. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction toward carbon-containing products, including C1 products (carbon monoxide, formic acid, etc), C2 products (ethylene, ethanol, etc.) and multi-carbon products (e.g., npropanol), provides beneficial fuel and chemicals for industrial production. The complexity of the multi-proton transfer processes and difficulties of C-C coupling in electrochemical CO2 reduction toward multi-carbon(C2+) products have attracted increasing concerns on the design of catalysts in comparison with those of C1 products. In this paper, we review the main advances in the syntheses of multi-carbon products through electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction in recent years, introduce the basic principles of electrocatalytic CO2RR, and detailly elucidate two widely accepted mechanisms of C-C coupling reactions. Among abundant nanomaterials, copper-based catalysts are outstanding catalysts for the preparation of multi-carbon chemicals in electrochemical CO2RR attributing to effective C-C coupling reactions. Regarding the different selectivity of multi-carbon chemicals but extensively applied copper-based catalysts, we classify and summarize various Cu-based catalysts through separating diverse multi-carbon products, where the modification of spatial and electronic structures is beneficial to increase the coverage of CO or lower the activation energy barrier for forming CC bond to form the key intermediates and increase the production of multi-carbon products. Challenges and prospects involving the fundamental and development of copper-based catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction are also proposed.

In this work, a facile method to tune the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CRR) activities of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) was developed via the capping-agent-free involvement of a trace amount of Ag nanocrystals with a decreased size. After the optimization of experimental conditions, the CRR performance investigation confirms that Ag-GCN-0.2 exhibited a superior CRR performance, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of more than 72 ± 1% for CO in a wide potential range from −0.6 to −1.1 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and a max FE of 89 ± 1% at an overpotential of 0.9 V with a constant current density and a well-maintained microstructure even after 12 h of electrolysis. This work provides a new route to tune the catalytical performance of GCN and pave the way for the rational design, synthesis, and accurate estimation of the GCN-based catalysts, which will be synthesized on a large scale and utilized in industries.

Carbon dioxide can be electrochemically reduced to formate on tin electrodes. Formate is one of the most economically viable products of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). While CO2 is reduced to formate, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs concomitantly. The kinetics of CO2RR and HER on the tin electrode was investigated. Potentiodynamic polarization studies were conducted in CO2 saturated and N2 saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solutions, in the potential range from −0.014 V to −1.59 V vs. RHE. A faradaic efficiency of 93.95 % towards formate production was obtained at −1.09 V vs. RHE. The mass transfer effects and bicarbonate dissociation equilibrium were used to estimate the concentration of the reactants at the electrode surface. Density functional theory calculations indicate that –OCHO intermediate species is thermodynamically favoured, and a four-step reaction with two intermediates is proposed. The proposed mechanism captures the major features of the polarization data. CO2 reduction occurs via two intermediate species, viz. adsorbed H and OCHO species, while HER occurs via Volmer-Heyrovsky steps. The model predicts that in N2 saturated solutions, the fractional surface coverage of adsorbed H reaches a maximum of ∼0.48 at a potential of −0.82 V vs. RHE while in CO2 saturated solutions, the corresponding value is ∼0.29. In addition, the maximum fractional surface coverage of adsorbed OCHO is predicted to be ∼0.12 in CO2 saturated solutions.

This study examined the sensitivity of single-walled (5,5) aluminium nitride nanotubes ((5,5) AlNNTs) to carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas molecules by performing DFT calculations using a hybrid functional, specifically, B3LYP (Becke’s three-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr) exchange-correlation functional at a 6–31G* basis set. This research investigates the adsorption behavior of CO2 and CO molecules on pristine and silicon-doped aluminum nitride nanotubes (AlNNTs) and examines their implications for sensor applications. The study assesses each system’s adsorption energy, sensing potential, and recovery time to gain insights into their binding strength and practical viability. For CO2 adsorption on (5,5) AlNNT, significant adsorption energy of −24.36 kcal/mol was observed, indicating a strong binding to the nanotube surface, with a sensing potential of 8.95%. However, the slow recovery time of approximately 4.964 days may limit its real-time application. Si-(5,5) AlNNT exhibited a CO2 adsorption energy of −19.69 kcal/mol, a sensing potential of 5.40%, and a relatively short recovery time of approximately 2.978 min, making it a promising candidate for CO2 sensing. CO adsorption on (5,5) AlNNT showed an adsorption energy of −25.20 kcal/mol, a sensing potential of 9.095%, but a longer recovery time of approximately 20.130 days. Si-(5,5) AlNNT displayed a high CO adsorption energy of −20.78 kcal/mol, a sensing potential of 4.29%, and a recovery time of approximately 18.320 min. These findings provide insights into the adsorption characteristics of carbon molecules on AlNNTs, highlighting their potential for CO2 and CO sensing applications.

Abstract The conversion of CO 2 into chemical fuels, which can be stored and utilized through photocatalysis, represents an effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable means to address both environmental concerns and energy shortages. CO 2 , as a stable oxidation product, poses challenges for reduction through light energy alone, necessitating the use of catalysts. Thus, a crucial aspect of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction technology lies in the development of effective photocatalysts. Based on the basic principle of PCRR (photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction), the review provides a detailed introduction to the core issues in PCRR process, including the relationship between band gap and catalyst reduction performance, effective utilization of photogenerated carriers, product selectivity, and methods for product analysis. Then, the recent research progresses of various photocatalysts are reviewed in the form of research examples combined with the above basic principles. Finally, this review summarizes and provides insights into the effective techniques for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 , while also offering future prospects in this field.

We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/‐ hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/‐. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron‐donor and ‐acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC‐coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold‐hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand σ donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.

This study reports on determining kinetics of electrochemical reduction CO2 to CO on Au catalysts using the substrate generation/tip collection (SG/TC) mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). We introduced a simple but effective method based on transient technique to obtain a series of apparent heterogeneous rate constants k based on Fick’s second law by controlling the tip-substrate distance and the voltage of the substrate electrode within the SECM framework. By analysis the transient current recorded during the chronoamperometric characterization, we can successfully determine the apparent rate constant k for the simplified total conversion process of CO2 + 2H+ + 2e- → CO + H2O onto Au catalyst electrode serving as an example, which increases from 5.02 × 10–2 cm⋅s−1 to 7.16 × 10–2 cm⋅s−1 in the low potential range of −2.2 to −2.6 V (vs. Pt/PPy) and decreases to 6.54 × 10-2 cm⋅s−1 at –2.8 V (vs. Pt/PPy). The method proposed here can be applied to quantitatively analyze the kinetic of CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction, and thus provide a useful tool to guide the synthesis of catalyst as well as in-situ performance evaluation.

A new-type boron carbide material has been used, as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to C2 and C1 based on the computational study. Within the current research, DFT was adopted to investigate the BC3 nanoflake as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2. The optoelectronic attributes of the BC3 nanoflake indicated that BC3 nanoflake had a longer visible-light region and its band gap was 2.25 eV. Based on the spatial distribution of the LUMO and the HOMO, the introduction of boron extended the π network of BC3 nanoflake, thereby dramatically increasing the photocatalytic efficiency. Additionally, we estimated the Gibbs free energy of each potential CO2 reaction path onto BC3 nanoflake. Based on the findings, CO2 could reduce into CH4 and CH3CH2OH with low limiting potentials of −0.41 V and −0.53 V, respectively. The current study can provide useful insights into the application of BC3 nanoflake as an encouraging photocatalyst for the reduction reaction CO2.

In the carbonate industry, deep decarbonization strategies are necessary to effectively remediate CO2. These strategies mainly include both sustainable energy supplies and the conversion of CO2 in downstream processes. This study developed a coupled process of biomass chemical looping H2 production and reductive calcination of CaCO3. Firstly, a mass and energy balance of the coupled process was established in Aspen Plus. Following this, process optimization and energy integration were implemented to provide optimized operation conditions. Lastly, a life cycle assessment was carried out to assess the carbon footprint of the coupled process. Results reveal that the decomposition temperature of CaCO3 in an H2 atmosphere can be reduced to 780 oC (generally around 900 oC), and the conversion of CO2 from CaCO3 decomposition reached 81.33% with an H2:CO ratio of 2.49 in gaseous products. By optimizing systemic energy through heat integration, an energy efficiency of 86.30% was achieved. Additionally, the carbon footprint analysis revealed that the process with energy integration had a low GWP of -2.624 kgCO2-eq·kg-CaO-1. Conclusively, this work performed a systematic analysis of introducing biomass-derived H2 into CaCO3 calcination and demonstrated the positive role of reductive calcination using green H2 in mitigating CO2 emissions within the carbonate industry.

The limiting global carbon budget underscores the urgent need for effective and ambitious climate mitigation measures across diverse sectors to curb greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further exacerbation of global warming, aligning with international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. The role of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) becomes increasingly crucial in this context, though the extent to which this applies as a complementary measure to mitigation actions still requires careful examination and quantitative analysis. In this study, we carry out an assessment contingent upon the intertwined roles of mitigation actions and the levels of CDR deployment using the Energy-Rapid Overview and Decision-Support (En-ROADS) simulation tool. We develop sectoral emission reduction assumptions and a broad portfolio of CDR archetypes and deployment levels to evaluate their impacts on the intricate climate-land-energy nexus, and global warming temperature. We find that high levels of CDR permit the continual consumption of fossil fuels, though driving substantial renewable energy consumption post-mid-century. We also observe that high levels of CDR negatively impact sustainability factors, such as reduction in agricultural farmland, which is pronounced under high mitigation actions. We observe that the largest share of CDR is in agricultural soil carbon, with its proportion ranging from 27.4 % to 31.3 % across all scenarios. In conclusion, though CDRs are what put the ‘net’ in the ‘net-zero emissions’ goal, they are not a silver bullet but rather a crucial piece in the complex puzzle of climate action. We recommend that CDR should be strategically deployed as complementary options to vigorous emission reduction efforts, as this paves the way towards a sustainable and balanced approach to achieving our global climate objectives.

Experimental and numerical evaluation of steam and carbon dioxide gasification on torrefied palm kernel shell in an updraft fixed bed gasifier is studied. Euler-Lagrangian two-dimensional model with 15 kinetic reactions is developed to investigate tar formation in relation to torrefaction temperature, gasification temperature, and steam-to-carbon-dioxide ratio (S-CO2-R). The combination of steam and CO2 had considerable effect on the tar reduction and also influenced the gaseous composition significantly when the varying parameters were compared. The results show that increasing both gasification temperature and S-CO2-R do enhance the H2 production whiles drastically reducing the tar formation. The tar concentration reduced by 21.4 % and 20.5 % by changing the S-CO2-R from 0.4 to 2.0 and gasification process temperature from 973 and 1173 K respectively. An increase in hydrogen is also observed, from 55.5 % to 60.84 %, when the S-CO2-R is increased to 1.2. Similarly, 29.1 % increase is observed in gasification efficiency as compared to the raw-PKS.

Controlling the valence states of copper is pivotal in determining the selectivity of products in CO2 electroreduction. In this study, we developed a Cu doped carbon catalyst (CuNC) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOFs) through a straightforward solution reaction and calcination method. The N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites exhibited adjustable C1 and C2 selectivity in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CER). Specifically, the CuNC-700 demonstrated an impressive C2 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 56.0% at -1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a remarkable C1 FE of 56.7% with a total current density of 600 mA/cm2 at -1.6 V vs RHE. In the entire potential range, the CuNC-700 consistently maintained high FE values of > 92% for CER, while the FE values for hydrogen evolution reaction is below 8%. This study unveiled the correlation between the selectivity and the valence states of copper. At low applied potentials, the abundance of N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites led to the predominant production of the C2 products. The Cu0 played a primary role in activating CO2 and facilitating subsequent electron transfer, while the Cu+ enhanced the adsorption of *CO, further promoting the C-C coupling. Under high applied potentials, both Cu2+ and Cu+ were converted to Cu0, favoring the methanation process. This research paves the way for future design of Cu-based MOF-derived materials, enabling precise regulation of C1/C2 selectivity in CER.

Herein, a novel mesoporous TS-1(mTS-1) zeolite-confined metal oxides nanoclusters Cu-Bi@mTS-1 was developed for efficient photoelectrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (PEC CO2RR). The catalyst Cu-Bi@mTS-1 as a photocathode showed high activity, achieving a maximum methanol Faraday efficiency (FECH3OH) of 93.4% at -0.7 V vs. RHE. In-situ Raman results indicate the formation of key reaction intermediates *OCH3 and *CHO during the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. The C2 product ethanol could be also detected at higher potentials during PEC CO2RR. It is believed that the hierarchically porous structure of mTS-1 is conducive to the enrichment of CO2 molecules to increase the reactant concentration, also can promote C-C coupling through photoelectric synergism. This work provides a favorable reference for the rational design of photocathodes by confinement effect of porous structure.

Finding efficient photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction catalysts is one of the core issues in addressing global climate change. Herein, the pristine CsPbI3 perovskite and doped CsPbI3 perovskite were evaluated in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C1 products by using density functional theory. Free energy testing and electronic structure analysis methods have shown that doped CsPbI3 exhibits more effective catalytic performance, higher selectivity, and stability than undoped CsPbI3. Additionally, it is discovered that CsPbI3 (100) and (110) crystal surfaces have varied product selectivity. The photo-catalytic effectiveness is increased by the narrower band gap of Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3, which broadens the absorption spectrum of visible light and makes electron transport easier. The calculation results indicate that Bi doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal faces exhibit good selectivity towards CH4, with free energy barriers as low as 0.55 eV and 0.58 eV, respectively. Sn doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal planes exhibit good selectivity for HCOOH and CH3OH, respectively. The results indicate that the Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst can further improve the CO2 photocatalytic activity and high selectivity for C1 products, making it a suitable substrate material for high-performance CO2RR.

To mitigate greenhouse effects, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been used as an efficient means of carbon reduction. In CO2 electrolyzer, CO2 shortage can happen and degrade the reaction efficiency. Herein, an efficient and long-lived formic acid three-cell electrolyzer is used to study the effect of CO2 shortage, by operating the electrolyzer from full CO2 supply to CO2 shortage. In addition, the effects of various CO2 fluxes and concentrations on the electrolyzer current, acid concentration and lifetime are investigated. The results demonstrated that the electrolyzer current and the CO to H2 ratio both decreases from full CO2 to CO2 shortage, indicating that the reactivity of converting CO2 into formic acid ions is weakened. On the contrary, the hydrogen evolution reaction is intensified. Long-term CO2 shortage also cause the catalyst to detach and agglomerate in the cathode catalyst layer, reducing its active surface area and overall performance. Compared with the CO2 flux, the CO2 concentration exerts a more pronounced influence. To ensure the electrolysis efficiency, the carbon dioxide concentration should not be less than 80 %.

Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.

Plasmonic-driven photocatalysis may lead to reaction selectivity that cannot be otherwise achieved. A fundamental role is played by hot carriers, i.e., electrons and holes generated upon plasmonic decay within the metal nanostructure interacting with molecular species. Understanding the elusive microscopic mechanism behind such selectivity is a key step in the rational design of hot-carrier reactions. To accomplish that, we present state-of-the-art multiscale simulations, going beyond density functional theory, of hot-carrier injections for the rate-determining step of a photocatalytic reaction. We focus on carbon dioxide reduction, for which it was experimentally shown that the presence of a rhodium nanocube under illumination leads to the selective production of methane against carbon monoxide. We show that selectivity is due to a (predominantly) direct hole injection from rhodium to the reaction intermediate CHO. Unexpectedly, such an injection does not promote the selective reaction path by favoring proper bond breaking but rather by promoting bonding of the proper molecular fragment to the surface.

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two‐dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state‐of‐the‐art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.

This perspective highlights unconventional and emerging approaches to CO2 reduction. These methods encompass the use of topological materials and 3D printing in electrochemistry and the broader fields of plasma- and magneto-electrochemistry. Sustainability in these methods offers a way to convert CO2 into value-added fuels in a circular energy economy. We identify challenges of reducing CO2 along sustainable pathways and detail ways that unconventional approaches can address these challenges. These include achieving high product selectivity toward desirable chemicals, high catalytic durability, high energy efficiency, and high conversion rates of CO2. Finally, we describe emerging impacts and opportunities of these unconventional approaches and key challenges.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) properties of boron-doped diamond powder (BDDP) were investigated. A BDDP-painted electrode was prepared by casting BDDP ink on the surface of a BDD thin-film electrode as a current collector. The CO2RR properties of the BDDP-painted electrode were compared to those of conventional BDD thin-film electrodes, which were prepared directly on a conductive silicon wafer substrate by the microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition method. The result of the electrolysis at −1.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M KCl catholyte showed that the BDDP-painted electrode was superior to the BDD thin-film electrode because it produced a large amount of products (formic acid and carbon monoxide) at a low overpotential. The highest performance of the CO2RR in the BDDP-painted electrode was achieved with the BDDP with high boron doping and high sp2 carbon content. We considered that structural defects, boron doping level, and sp2 carbon content influenced the reactivity for CO2 reduction. Therefore, the BDDP-painted electrodes should be useful not only for the production of a large-size electrode but also for efficient CO2RR.

Drawing inspiration from the natural process of photosynthesis found in plant leaves, scientists are exploring the use of photocatalysis to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products using solar light and water. Photocatalytic CO2 conversion has emerged as one of the efficient green approaches to revitalize the environment from greenhouse gas pollution. Owing to its visible-range band gap, non-toxicity, ease of synthesis at economic costs and stability under light irradiation, g-C3N4 has emerged as the most explored photocatalyst. However, due to rampant exciton recombination owing to poor electrical conductivity, the efficiency of CO2 reduction falls short for g-C3N4 in its pure/pristine form. Therefore, the structural manoeuvre of g-C3N4 materials using N-rich configurations, heteroatom/single-atom doping and hybridization with various functional materials including metal oxides/sulfides, perovskite halides and metal complexes has been adopted, thereby overcoming their inherent drawbacks in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this timely review, we present an overview of the recent advances in surface/interface engineering of carbon nitrides for the conversion of CO2 to fuels and useful chemical by-products. More importance is given to the critical evaluation of surface manipulation in carbon nitrides and how it amplifies and affects their photocatalytic properties in CO2 reduction. Finally, we provide a comprehensive outlook into the future directions of these functionalised carbon nitrides for various applications. We strongly believe that this unique review will offer new knowledge on the surface property relationship of carbon nitride-based materials and their impact on enhancing their performance in various photocatalytic reactions and further create new opportunities for them in various areas.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction towards various fuels is of significant interest under the background of mitigating the global warming induced by CO2 emission and lowering the depletion of fossil fuels. However, state-of-the-art photocatalysts still suffer from sluggish reaction dynamics and frustrated product selectivity, especially for C2+ generations, which are of great interest for industrial applications. Over the past decades, comprehensive research on solar-driven CO2 reduction has consistently unveiled some encouraging results in meaningful pathways and architectural design of active sites over photocatalysts. This review highlights the recent advances in boosting photocatalytic CO2 reduction of atomically dispersed catalysts via engineered active sites, including two separated active sites, paired dual-active sites, and nanoclusters based on the configuration of active sites. Both the mechanism of CO2 activation over active sites and advanced characterization methods are discussed in detail. Particularly, in consideration of the wide gap between fundamental research and practical applications, the integrations of experimental and theoretical results are analyzed to realize the underlying structure-activity relationships as well as promising selectivity toward target products. Finally, the remaining challenges in the field are outlined, and inquisitive perspectives with a focus on the rational design of active sites and mechanistic investigation are proposed.

Inspired by the photosynthesis of green plants in nature, an artificial photosynthesis system of MF/Co-BWO/CPB-Cu with “root”, “trunk” and “leaf” is designed in this study, realizing efficient overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Melamine foam (MF) with strong hydrophilicity and abundant porosity is selected as “root” and “trunk”, which can store and transfer liquid H2O. For the “leaf” design, Bi2WO6 and CsPbBr3 are selected as oxidation and reduction photocatalysts, respectively, which would generate Bi2WO6/CsPbBr3 S-scheme heterojunction. CuS and CoO as reduction and oxidation centers are also introduced into photosynthesis system, respectively. CuS plays an important role in CO2 adsorption and activation, while CoO could promote H2O oxidation and supply proton. Moreover, Co-BWO/CPB-Cu as “leaf” could trigger the “transpiration” from MF via photo-thermal effect, inducing the formation of gas–solid biphase CO2RR system. As a result, the artificial photosynthesis system of MF/Co-BWO/CPB-Cu exhibits the efficient CO2RR efficiency.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCR) technology is one of the potential strategies to mitigate the greenhouse effect, solve the energy crisis and achieve goals of carbon dioxide emissions peak and carbon neutrality. However, it is extremely difficult to adsorb and activate CO2 due to the high dissociation energy of C = O bond in CO2 molecule (750 kJ·mol−1), resulting in poor performance of PCR. In addition, in the heterogeneous reaction process, adsorbing and activating CO2 are closely related to the active sites on the surface of photocatalyst. Therefore, in-depth and detailed exploration of the adsorption and activation of CO2 on active sites is critical to developing high-performance photocatalysts. Herein, this review firstly explores adsorption modes of CO2 on the active sites of photocatalyst, including physisorption and chemisorption, where chemisorption includes oxygen, carbon and mixed adsorption. Secondly, reaction pathways for the formation of different high value-added chemical products are introduced, including formaldehyde, carbene, glyoxal and mixed pathways. Then, strategies for enhancing the adsorption and activation of CO2 are briefly summarized. Finally, the future prospects and challenges of PCR development are discussed. This work provides insights and references for further designing photocatalysts that can enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2 and improve the performance of PCR.
