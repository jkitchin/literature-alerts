Oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu)-based materials containing Cuδ+ (0 < δ ≤ 1) have been considered as promising electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) to produce valuable C2 products, which, however, suffer from poor stability, mainly due to the inevitable reduction of Cuδ+. We report here that the benzyl alcohol (BA) introduced in catholyte presents a markedly positive effect on the durability and C2 selectivity enhancement of ECO2RR when OD-Cu-based material is adopted as cathode electrocatalyst. The critical evidence of ECO2RR intermediates has been provided by in situ Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, which reveals the surface mechanisms of BA-assisted ECO2RR over OD-Cu catalysts. On the one hand, the introduction of BA increases the CO2 supply for ECO2RR by slowing down its neutralizing reaction, which results in the increased intermediate species coverage on the catalytic surface therefore the delayed self-reduction of Cuδ+; On the other hand, the interaction between BA and the intermediate species *CO during ECO2RR brings an enhanced selectivity of C2 products (FE C2 = 85.5 % at −1.38 V vs RHE). Besides, an energy-savings and economic electrolyzer can be achieved by coupling anodic BA oxidation reaction to benzoic acid and ECO2RR to C2 products with much lowered cell voltages.

The rapid increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has sparked a global enthusiasm for carbon recycling. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction with water into carbon‐containing products has attracted much attention since it can convert solar energy to the chemical potential of the products and CO2 to valuable compounds at the same time. One of the main products in the photocatalytic reaction system is carbon monoxide (CO), a useful compound for the one‐carbon chemistry and related ones. The current shortage of this system is the low production efficiency, demanding us to improve the activity of the photocatalyst. In this perspective article, by taking a calcium titanate (CaTiO3, CTO) photocatalyst with silver cocatalyst (Ag/CTO) and so on as examples that can promote the selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction with water, we shortly review some strategies to improve the photocatalytic activity such as fabrication of well‐structured crystal photocatalysts, development of the surface property and cocatalyst, improvement of surface CO2 adsorption, and improvement of photoabsorption. These concepts will be widely applied and contribute to further development of photocatalytic systems.

Atomic-scale understanding of C-C coupling in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable C2 chemicals remains elusive. Herein, we selected Group VIII and IB transition metals as active sites incorporated into the Cu(1 0 0) surface to construct single-atom alloy catalysts. The stability, selectivity, and activity of a series of catalysts were calculated using density functional theory. Fe, Co, Ni, Ru/Cu(1 0 0) exhibit the potential as candidates to generate C2 products and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The reaction proceeds through the reduction of CO2 to key intermediates *CO and *CHO, which undergoes C-C coupling to generate *CO-CHO, subsequently undergoing different protonation processes to yield diverse C2 products. The rate-determining step for Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru/Cu(1 0 0), is the hydrogenation of *CO, with a comparable energy barrier of 0.8 eV. Moreover, Fe and Co/Cu(1 0 0) favor the formation of C2H4 as the primary product, while Ni and Ru/Cu(1 0 0) predominantly produce CH3COOH.

Ethylene is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters and the most diversly used commodity chemicals globally. Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethylene received great attention from the research society to decarbonize the ethylene production. In this study, a life-cycle analysis is conducted using the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model on the three electrocatalytic CO2-reduction pathways (or “e-ethylene” pathways): i) cascade conversion via carbon monoxide intermediate; ii) single-step conversion in membrane electrode assembly (MEA); and iii) single-step conversion in alkaline flow cell. The results showed that the electricity consumption is the lowest for the cascade pathway (164 MJ/kg), thus resulting in the lowest cradle-to-gate carbon intensity [18 kgCO2e/kg with United States (US) average grid)] among the three pathways followed by the single-step MEA (32 kgCO2e/kg) and then by the single-step alkaline (56 kgCO2e/kg). However, all three e-ethylene pathways were significantly more carbon-intensive than their fossil-based counterpart (1.1 kgCO2e/kg) due to their excessive energy consumption with the current state of technology. With renewable electricity, all three pathways yielded negative carbon intensity: from −3.1 kgCO2e/kg to −1.6 kgCO2e/kg depending on the source of CO2. The threshold carbon intensity of electricity (TCIE), defined as the upper bound of the carbon intensity of electricity to achieve lower carbon intensity for e-ethylene compared to fossil-based ethylene, is calculated for both current and future state of e-ethylene technologies. The cascade pathway had the highest TCIE out of the three e-ethylene pathways for both current (92 gCO2e/kWh) and future (124 gCO2e/kWh) state of technologies. However, the carbon intensity of average US grid (i.e., 467 and 303 gCO2e/kWh for current and future projections) were higher than the TCIEs of the corresponding timeline. Thus, reducing electricity requirement for e-ethylene pathways and bringing low-carbon generation mix in the United States (US) grid faster than the current projection are both essential to decarbonize ethylene and its downstream chemicals/polymers.

Copper-based catalysts have been extensively investigated in electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to promote carbon products generated by requiring multiple electron transfer. However, hydrophilic electrodes are unfavourable for CO2 mass transfer and preferentially hydrogen (H2) evolution in electrochemical CO2 reduction. In this paper, a hydrophilic cupric oxide (CuO) electrode with a grassy morphology was prepared. CuO-derived Cu was confirmed as the active site for electrochemical CO2 reduction through wettability modulation. To enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity, a metal-oxide heterogeneous interface was created by engineering modulation at the interface, involving the loading of palladium (Pd) on CuO (CuO/Pd). Both the electrochemically active area and the electron transfer rate were enhanced by Pd loading, and significantly the reduced work function further facilitated the electron transfer between the electrode surface and the electrolyte. Consequently, the CuO/Pd electrode exhibited excellent excellent performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction, achieving a 54 % Faraday efficiency at −0.65 V for methanol (CH3OH). The metal-oxide interfacial effect potentially improves the intrinsic catalytic activity of hydrophilic CuO electrodes in electrochemical CO2 reduction, providing a conducive pathway for optimizing hydrophilic oxide electrodes in this process.

Processing CO2 into value‐added chemicals and fuels stands as one of the most crucial tasks in addressing the global challenge of the greenhouse effect. In this study, we focused on the complex (dpp‐bian)NiBr2 (where dpp‐bian is di‐isopropylphenyl bis‐iminoacenaphthene) as a precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CH4 as the sole product. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the realization of a catalytically effective pattern requires the three‐electron reduction of (dpp‐bian)NiBr2. The chemically reduced complexes [K(THF)6]+[(dpp‐bian)Ni(COD)]– and [K(THF)6]+[(dpp‐bian)2Ni]– were synthesized and structurally characterized. Analyzing the data from the electron paramagnetic resonance study of the complexes in a solution, along with quantum‐chemical calculations, reveals that the spin density is predominantly localized at their metal centers. The superposition of trajectory maps of the electron density gradient field and the one‐electron electrostatic force field, along with the atomic charges, discloses that, within the first coordination sphere, the interatomic charge transfer occurs from the metal atom to the ligand atoms and that the complex anions can thus be formally described by the general formulas (dpp‐bian)2–Ni+(COD) and (dpp‐bian)2–Ni+. It was shown that the reduced nickel complexes can be oxidized by formic acid; resulting from this reaction, the two‐electron and two‐proton addition product dpp‐bian‐2H is formed.

The steel industry, which relies heavily on primary energy, is one of the industries with the highest CO2 emissions in China. It is urgent for the industry to identify ways to embark on the path to “green steel”. Hydrogen metallurgy technology uses hydrogen as a reducing agent, and its use is an important way to reduce CO2 emissions from long-term steelmaking and ensure the green and sustainable development of the steel industry. Previous research has demonstrated the feasibility and emission reduction effects of hydrogen metallurgy technology; however, further research is needed to dynamically analyze the overall impact of the large-scale development of hydrogen metallurgy technology on future CO2 emissions from the steel industry. This article selects the integrated MARKAL-EFOM system (TIMES) model as its analysis model, constructs a China steel industry hydrogen metallurgy model (TIMES-CSHM), and analyzes the resulting impact of hydrogen metallurgy technology on CO2 emissions. The results indicate that in the business-as-usual scenario (BAU scenario), applying hydrogen metallurgy technology in the period from 2020 to 2050 is expected to reduce emissions by 203 million tons, and make an average 39.85% contribution to reducing the steel industry’s CO2 emissions. In the carbon emission reduction scenario, applying hydrogen metallurgy technology in the period from 2020 to 2050 is expected to reduce emissions by 353 million tons, contributing an average of 41.32% to steel industry CO2 reduction. This study provides an assessment of how hydrogen metallurgy can reduce CO2 emissions in the steel industry, and also provides a reference for the development of hydrogen metallurgy technology.

The cement industry in supporting sustainable development is faced with the challenge of reducing energy consumption, natural resources and emissions generated from its production activities. PT X is one of the cement industries in Indonesia that has a production design capacity of 2.6 million tons/year. PT X's cement production activities use several fossil fuel energy sources and alternative fuels that can produce carbon dioxide emissions that are wasted into the environment. This study aims to identify process units that produce significant impacts to determine alternative environmental improvement scenarios. The method used is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a tool for calculating potential environmental impacts, and AHP as an alternative selection of environmental improvement program scenarios. The scope of the LCA study carried out with the scope of "Cradle to Gate" includes the stages of the raw material extraction process, the production process to the distribution of cement. The resulting potential environmental impact is a total Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 0.20543 tons CO2 eq/ton. The largest potential impact comes from the kiln unit of 0.20221 tons CO2 eq/ton or an impact contribution of 98.43%. Based on the environmental impacts generated, there are 4 alternative programs that can be used to reduce the environmental impacts generated. The selection of alternative program scenarios is based on 3 criteria based on 3 types of respondents. Alternatif program yang memiliki nilai prioritas tertinggi yaitu alternatif program 1 dengan sebesar 35,5%, 38,1%, dan 23,4%.

Based on our previous study in chemical subtleties of the proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD‐MH) to regulate the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), we have developed a family of Mn terpyridine derivatives, in which urea groups functioning as multipoint hydrogen‐bonding hangman to accelerate the reaction rate. We found that such changes to the second coordination sphere significantly increased the turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2 reduction to ca. 360 s‐1 with this family of molecular catalysts while maintaining high selectivity (ca. 100% ± 3) for CO even in the presence of a large amount of phenol as proton source. Notably, the compounds studied in this manuscript all exhibit large value for CO as that achieved by Fe porphyrins derivates, while saving up to 0.55 V in overpotential with respect to the latter.

To test the ability of geochemical surfaces in serpentinizing hydrothermal systems to catalyze reactions from which metabolism arose, we investigated H2‐dependent CO2 reduction toward metabolic intermediates over silica‐supported Co‒Fe catalysts. Supported catalysts converted CO2 to various products at 180 °C and 2.0 MPa. The liquid product phase included formate, acetate, and ethanol, while the gaseous product phase consisted of CH4, CO, methanol, and C2‒C7 linear hydrocarbons. The 1/1 ratio CoFe alloy with the same composition as the natural mineral wairauite yielded the highest concentrations of formate (6.0 mM) and acetate (0.8 mM), which are key intermediates in the acetyl‐coenzyme A (acetyl‐CoA) pathway of CO2 fixation. While Co‐rich catalysts were proficient at hydrogenation, yielding mostly CH4, Fe‐rich catalysts favored the formation of CO and methanol. Mechanistic studies indicated intermediate hydrogenation and C‒C coupling activities of alloyed CoFe, in contrast to physical mixtures of both metals. Co in the active site of Co‒Fe catalysts performed a similar reaction as tetrapyrrole‐coordinated Co in the corrinoid iron‐sulfur (CoFeS) methyl transferase in the acetyl‐CoA pathway. In a temperature range characteristic for deeper regions of serpentinizing systems, oxygenate product formation was favored at lower, more biocompatible temperatures.

Revealing the dynamic reconstruction process and tailoring advanced copper (Cu) catalysts is of paramount significance for promoting the conversion of CO2 into ethylene (C2H4), paving the way for carbon neutralization and facilitating renewable energy storage. In this study, we initially employed density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the restructuring behavior of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions and delineated its restructuring patterns. Leveraging insights into this restructuring behavior, we devised an efficient, low‐coordination copper‐based catalyst. The resulting synthesized catalyst demonstrated an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70% for ethylene generation at a current density of 800 mA cm‐2. Furthermore, it showed robust stability, maintaining consistent performance for 230 hours at a cell voltage of 3.5 V in a full‐cell system. Our research not only deepens the understanding of the active sites involved in designing efficient carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts but also advances CO2 electrolysis technologies for industrial application.

The world needs an increasing supply of nickel and cobalt production as battery materials for sustainable development. However, the complexity of laterite deposits and the need to control CO2 emissions challenge the enhanced global supply from laterites. This work investigates the effects of calcination as a pre-treatment for selective battery metal extraction from both limonite laterite and saprolite laterite together with concurrent achievement of CO2 mineralization. Calcination under a reducing atmosphere of CO-N2 or CO-CO2 gas mixtures can significantly enhance the extraction of critical metals from both limonite and saprolite laterites. With calcination, the hydrated silicate minerals and ferric oxides converted to reactive olivine and ferrous oxide. The calcines thus can participate in the CO2 mineralization process to stabilize CO2 as mineral carbonates and release nickel and cobalt arising from the CO2 mineral carbonation into solution as complex ions with a ligand (such as sodium nitrilotriacetate, NTA). The optimum calcination conditions are 20 ∼ 30 % CO in CO-CO2 gas mixture at 700 °C. Beyond the optimum range results in the inadequate conversion of ferric to ferrous at too low CO concentration or over calcination of ferric to metallic iron at too high CO concentration. At the optimum conditions, the nickel & cobalt extraction and CO2 mineralization can reach 90 %, 93 %, and 39 % from laterite. Each tonne saprolite with the pre-treatment of calcination can recover 20.5 kg nickel, 0.59 kg cobalt, and simultaneously sequester 142 kg CO2 as stable mineral carbonates. The pre-treatment through slightly reductive calcination enables the robust suitability of the developed process for all layers of laterites for both critical battery metal recovery and carbon mineralization.

Abstract CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers is vital to reduce the global carbon footprint. However, this effort can be hampered due to salt precipitation during CO2 injection, which clogs flow pathways leading to a significant reduction in CO2 injectivity. While freshwater has traditionally been employed as the primary solution to dissolve the precipitated salt, the salt tends to re-precipitate upon CO2 reinjection post-treatment, exacerbating the injectivity damage. The project was divided into two stages: (1) simulating salt precipitation scenarios with varying brine salinities to mimic formation damage during CO2 injection in saline aquifers, and (2) critically assessing the impact and effectiveness of acetic acid as a mitigation fluid under different injection scenarios through core-flooding experiments. The results were compared with freshwater and low salinity water (LSW). Mineralogical and petrographical assessments were carried out on the core samples to characterize the Berea sandstone cores. The core flooding experiments were conducted at 60 °C and 1600 psi for CO2 injection, freshwater, LSW and acetic acid flooding. The experimental results revealed significant reductions in permeability (37% -75% impairment) and porosity (18% to 33%) due to salt precipitation. Among the treatments, LSW exhibited the lowest efficacy, followed by freshwater, possibly due to clay swelling, fines migration, and capillary trapping effects causing pore throat blockages. In contrast to freshwater and LSW, acetic acid treatment demonstrated improved injectivity, showing a high dissolution potential with up to a 137% increase compared to initial permeability. This study provides a preliminary assessment of the potential of acetic acid for CO2 injectivity enhancement and recommends further investigations on the effects of acetic acid and brine concentrations on the process.

Cu‐based catalysts have been identified as the most promising candidates for generation of C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Defect engineering in catalysts is a widely employed strategy for promoting C‐C coupling on Cu. However, comprehensive understanding of defect structure‐to‐activity relationship has not been obtained. In this study, controllable defects generation is achieved, which leads to a series of Cu‐based catalysts with various phase mixing degrees. It is observed that the Faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products increases with the phase mixing degree, reaching 81% at maximum. In‐situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the catalysts with higher phase mixing degree tend to form *CO more easily and possess higher retention of *CO under high overpotential window, thereby promoting C‐C coupling. This work sheds new light on the relationship between defects and C‐C coupling, and the rational developed of more advanced Cu‐base catalysts.
