This article introduces three significant ways of producing methane by electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide. Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide can efficiently convert CO2 molecules into various high-energy fuels under ambient conditions. Methane gas, among them, stands out due to its relatively high calorific value, chemical stability, ease of storage and transportation. Therefore, research on electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to generate methane is crucial. Common methods include adjusting catalyst morphology to expose more active sites, building nanoscale catalysts results in smaller-sized nanostructured copper and combining copper with other metals to form alloys, creating multi-metal catalysts. By optimizing these catalysts, we can efficiently reduce carbon dioxide into methane.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising technology for the utilization of captured CO2. Though systems using aqueous electrolytes is the state‐of‐the‐art, CO2RR in aprotic solvents are a promising alternative that can avoid the parallel hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). While system parameters, such as electrolyte composition, electrode material, and applied potential are known to influence the reaction mechanism, there is a lack of intuitive understanding as to how. We show that by using multivariate data analysis on a large dataset collected from the literature, namely random forest modelling, the most important system parameters can be isolated for each possible product. We find that water content, current density, and applied potential are powerful determinants in the reaction pathway, and therefore in the Faradaic efficiency of CO2RR products.

Abstract The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to the reduced chemical compounds offers substantial environmental benefits through minimizing the emission of greenhouse gas and fostering sustainable practices. Recently, the unique properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) make them attractive candidates for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), providing many opportunities to develop efficient, selective, and environmentally sustainable processes for mitigating CO 2 emissions and utilizing CO 2 as a valuable raw material for the synthesis of fuels and chemicals. Here, the recent advances in MOFs as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic CO 2 RR are summarized. The detailed characteristics, electrocatalytic mechanisms, and practical approaches for improving the electrocatalytic efficiency, selectivity, and durability of MOFs under realistic reaction conditions are also clarified. Furthermore, the outlooks on the prospects of MOF-based electrocatalysts in CO 2 RR are provided.

## Designing Molecular and Two Dimensional Metalloporphyrin Catalysts for the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction

A computational investigation of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) on metalloporphyrin (M-POR) catalysts, featuring varying metal centres (Ni, Fe, Cu, and Co), oxidation states, and anchoring ligands, was conducted using density functional theory calculations. The evaluation of the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of the M-POR systems concluded that neutral systems are more stable than charged systems, with the doubly reduced systems being the most unstable. The reaction free energy profiles for CO2R to the C1 products CO and HCOOH were computed according to two possible mechanisms: coupled proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and proton transfer – electron transfer (PT-ET). The PCET pathways was found to be by far the most favourable, leading to the preferential formation of HCOOH over CO. Among the catalysts, Fe-POR exhibited the best catalytic performance for CO/HCOOH formation. To evaluate competition with the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), overpotentials of the CO2R and HER were compared for all systems. This comparison, along with the PCET analysis, revealed that most systems favour HCOOH production. The most promising M-PORs were then to generate models of two-dimensional (2D) carbonaceous frameworks, exploring their potential for CO2R, with 2D Fe-PORs being active towards C1 formation.

Reducing energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions in buildings is one of the key aspects of climate change on a global level. To put the building sector on a low carbon development path, policies and adequate financing play a crucial role in each region. In the global South, policies and regulations related to the decarbonization of the building stock are increasingly being implemented. For policy and decision makers, adequate data on the status quo of the building stock, as well as the quantification of energy reduction measures, are essential to make informed decisions on the building regulatory and funding framework. The objective of this study is to provide data-driven insights into the potential for energy and CO2 reduction in buildings across various hot climate zones in the Global South. A simulation-based approach was employed to model five different building types, ranging from residential homes to office buildings, under a variety of architectural and building services scenarios. The simulations were conducted using the dynamic building energy simulation tool EnergyPlus, which assessed the impact of various energy-saving measures under both current and projected future climate conditions. This study concludes that optimizing passive design features, such as improved windows, solar shading, and reflective surfaces, in conjunction with active systems like decentralized cooling units and renewable energy integration, can result in a notable reduction in energy demand and emissions. Our findings provide a robust basis for policymakers to develop targeted energy efficiency strategies for buildings in hot climate zones, which will play a crucial role in achieving climate goals in the Global South.

Abstract Global climate change is an urgent environmental challenge . To mitigate global warming, Solar Radiation Management (SRM) is being explored as a means to reduce the solar energy reaching Earth’s surface, thus controlling temperature rise. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions remain the main cause of global warming. Large-scale photovoltaic installations, which are key for renewable energy generation, can also exacerbate local heat island effects and potentially impact both local and global climates . To address these issues, recent advancements in selective transmission and reflection photovoltaic materials have offered promising solutions. These materials achieve high energy conversion efficiency while reflecting significant portions of sunlight, thereby lowering surface temperatures. By combining solar radiation reflection with CO2 emissions reduction through clean energy generation, photovoltaic panels play a dual role in climate regulation . This study utilizes numerical simulations to evaluate the long-term climate impact of these novel photovoltaic materials, focusing on their effectiveness in surface temperature regulation and CO2 reduction.

Abstract: The oil and gas industry plays a significant role in the release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately gauge and minimize its carbon footprint which requires the thorough measurement of emissions and the identification of the primary sources of carbon emissions. By doing so, we can then determine the most effective methods for reducing these emissions. This study aims to precisely quantify and decrease the carbon footprint associated with drilling operations. To achieve this, we evaluated the diesel and petrol consumption from an onshore drilling project in the Niger Delta and used an emissions model to assess carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a drilling rig, thus gaining a comprehensive understanding of current emission levels and the potential for reduction. The data collected included the daily fuel consumption for power generation, transportation, and handling vehicles. The CO2 emissions resulting from fuel consumption were calculated and measured to be 103.5 metric tonnes. Our analysis determined that the primary contributor to the emissions was the energy generation on the site, primarily from the generators. Additionally, it was found that the circulating system on the rig was the main source of CO2 emissions. The study underscores the necessity for long-term impact assessments of drilling fluids and new technologies, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to further decrease emissions.

The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C‐C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon‐circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water‐gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite‐based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small‐pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one‐pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in‐depth for Rh‐catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.

Hypertrophic scars arise from aberrant wound healing and can lead to functional and aesthetic impairments. One of the common interventions for treating hypertrophic scars is fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, which employs narrow laser beams to stimulate dermal collagen deposition. Recent studies and reports have suggested that combining laser therapy with other interventions such as botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and topical growth factors may enhance treatment outcomes. Here, we examine the efficacy and safety of a sequential combination of BTX-A, fractional CO2 laser, and topical growth factors, referred to as combined therapy, for treating hypertrophic scars compared with only using fractional CO2 laser and topical growth factors, referred to as monotherapy. Our retrospective study includes 128 patients with hypertrophic scars (56 underwent monotherapy and 72 underwent combined therapy), which were followed-up for up to 15 months after the initiation of treatment to collect demographic and clinical data. Our analysis showed that the combined therapy significantly outperformed monotherapy in improving Vancouver scar scale scores (P < 0.05) and in the reduction of scar thickness (P < 0.05), without increasing adverse complications. Repeated treatments further augmented the efficacy of the combined therapy. Subgroup analysis revealed that combined therapy was notably more effective in reducing Vancouver scar scale scores and scar thickness in early-stage scars compared to late-stage (P = 0.023 and P = 0.045, respectively). Our study suggests that including BTX-A treatment before fractional CO2 laser and topical growth factors offers superior efficacy in reducing hypertrophic scars. We encourage early intervention and repeated treatments for optimal treatment outcomes.

Indoor air quality (IAQ) and energy consumption (Q) are well-known building estimators, but they are used separately. Energy consumption is used during the design stage, while IAQ is used during operation. The novelty of our approach is that we propose using both estimators simultaneously during building operations. The purpose of this study was to find an adaptive ventilation strategy that maintained good indoor air quality with minimal energy consumption. The second novelty of our approach consists of IAQ estimation. While the operation of ventilation systems depends only on the indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at present, our novel approach uses a more global IAQ index that includes four different air pollutants. Physical models are used for the hourly prediction of the two indices: global IAQ and Q. This study presents a comparative analysis of several ventilation operations strategies: fixed versus adaptive. The main findings show that a decrease in the ventilation rate, na, from 3.5 h−1 to 2.0 h−1 leads to a diminishment in energy consumption of 42.9%, maintaining the global IAQ index under the limited health risk value (VRL). Moreover, an adaptive ventilation strategy of na, maintaining the global IAQ index value under VRL, achieves a further reduction in energy consumption of 72.9%, highlighting its efficiency.

This study conducted a thorough analysis of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production of hot mix asphalt. The primary sources of energy usage in asphalt mixes are the heating of aggregates, asphalt, and burners, with aggregate heating accounting for a remarkable 97% of the total energy consumption. The results indicate that low-temperature asphalt mixes offer significant benefits over conventional hot mix asphalt in terms of energy efficiency and GHG emissions, with reductions in carbon dioxide emissions ranging from 18% to 36% and energy savings between 15% and 87%. Additionally, the use of recycled asphalt pavement led to a 12% decrease in carbon dioxide emissions and a 15% reduction in energy consumption. The study further explored the effects of various fuel types on emissions, revealing that replacing fuel oil with natural gas can effectively diminish the carbon footprint of the production process. By optimizing production temperatures and selecting cleaner fuel alternatives, this research highlights the potential for considerable energy savings and emission reductions within the asphalt production sector. These strategies not only promote sustainable road construction practices but also play a vital role in environmental protection and climate change mitigation, advocating for the adoption of innovative technologies in asphalt pavement production.

Abstract. With the development of the global economy and trade exchanges worldwide, urban infrastructure and industrial development have become part of the competition among countries. However, the construction industry and the production of chemical materials emit a large amount of carbon dioxide, leading to the continuous deterioration of the environment, so it is necessary to effectively reduce emissions. As a synonym for global emission reduction, carbon neutrality plays an important role in different industries, especially in civil engineering. In this paper, we start with building materials and green construction to explore the realization of carbon neutrality at the source and center of carbon emission in civil engineering. Firstly, we introduce the low-carbon production technologies of cement and steel, including calcium recycling and membrane separation technology in the cement industry, high-temperature combustion technology and carbon capture technology in steel industry. Then, we take renewable concrete as an example to discuss the emission reduction path of green building materials. Finally, it outlines how to carry out green construction, introduces assembly carbon reduction technology and energy integration system, and demonstrates the possibility of this green construction program in the case of "T&A House".

Abstract Bohai is rich in heavy oil. And its efficient development is significant. In this essay, ordinary heavy oil and extra one were selected, and the viscosity characteristics was also investigated referring to its internal composition. And so as the reducing viscosity effects of steam, oil-soluble viscosity reducer, diesel, emulsifier, flue gas and carbon dioxide. The experimental results show that resin and asphaltene content have positive effect on the viscosity of heavy oil. Compared with ordinary heavy oil, the drop is significantly greater when the temperature increases by 10°C. For ordinary heavy oil, the inflection point temperature is from 50°C to 70°C, and for extra-heavy oil, it is above 100°C. For ordinary heavy oil, its flow effect can be better improved without too high temperature, while it’s totally different for super heavy oil. For which, higher temperature and other auxiliary viscosity reduction methods are needed to achieve better flow performance. Diesel oil reduce viscosity of heavy oil by similar solubility principle, but the demand for diesel oil is large. At 50°C, the viscosity of super heavy oil with 0.5% emulsion viscosity reducer added is 36 mPa·s, but the water content needs to reach above 30%.Oil-soluble viscosity reducer reduces viscosity by dissolving asphaltenes and resins and dismantling aggregate structure of heavy oil aromatic flakes.However, the dosage should reach about 20 %, so that the viscosity of super heavy oil can be reduced to the level of dilute oil. Overall, for developing super heavy oil, steam compound with oil soluble viscosity reducer can be taken into account at the early production stage, and the emulsion viscosity reducer can be used in the middle development stage and wellbore viscosity reduction and lifting process. Finally, for ordinary heavy oil, flue gas’s viscosity reduction effects, nitrogen and carbon dioxide are investigated. It is found that the viscosity reduction effect of carbon dioxide is the best, followed by flue gas and nitrogen. Considering the offshore gas source, cost and carbon emission requirements, it is recommended to use flue gas in the field. The research provides theoretical guidance and technical reference for development of different types of offshore heavy oil.

Abstract Carbon reduction during the operational phase of buildings is a critical component in achieving global carbon neutrality objectives. Current methods for estimating carbon dioxide emissions in this phase predominantly focus on national or city-level scales, often ignoring the heterogeneity in building types and functions. This oversight limits the precision with which low-carbon management technologies can be applied to retrofit existing buildings effectively. To address this gap, we develop a building-based emissions accounting approach at city-scale that considers building type, function, floor area, and floor height of individual building. Additionally, we integrate point source data from facility-level power plants to characterize the structure of the energy supply sector. We then propose a suite of emission reduction technologies tailored for the operational phase of buildings, constructing baseline, regulatory, and blueprint scenarios to analyze the emission reduction pathways from 2020 to 2050. The demand-side pathways primarily target two key areas of emission reduction, such as modifying energy consumption behaviors by replacing conventional lighting with energy-efficient alternatives. On the supply-side, three major technological categories are addressed, including the conversion of coal-fired power plants to coal-biomass co-firing systems to enhance power generation efficiency. We applied the methodology to a global city of Nanjing, encompassing 534,000 individual buildings across 101 streets. Our analysis reveals that the carbon intensity of terminal energy use in commercial buildings in Nanjing is approximately 3.9 times higher than that in residential buildings. Enhancing energy efficiency in end-use sectors such as HVAC systems, commercial lighting, and electrical equipment emerges as the most effective strategy for reducing carbon emissions during the operational phase of commercial buildings. From a supply-side perspective, the early retirement of coal-fired power plants offers the most significant contribution to emission reductions. This approach accelerates the transition to a more efficient energy structure by phasing out outdated capacities before 2045 and optimizing the deployment of advanced power generation technologies, such as solar, wind, nuclear. Our findings offer targeted pathways for emission reduction during the operational phase of buildings and provide valuable scientific insights for policymakers.

Abstract This study explores a new approach in modeling explicit targets for decarbonization of the electricity and transport sectors combined with separate targets for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) based on the current plans and strategies put forward or expected by countries. Additionally, we examine an equitable "fair share" scenario that aligns sectoral decarbonization timelines and CDR liabilities with the respective capabilities of countries. In this "capability" burden-sharing principle, developed countries with the financial means to support their climate change mitigation efforts undertake faster energy transition while developing countries with lower incomes are allowed an extended timeline for decarbonization and are exempted from excessive CDR obligations. Here, we modify a technology-rich multi-sector model in a manner where explicit sectoral emission reduction and CDR targets can be modeled. Our analysis reveals that adopting this sector-specific strategy shows a potential reduction in residual emissions by up to 35%, and a 35-45% decrease in carbon removal requirement. Furthermore, sector-specific decarbonization and carbon removal targets not only help mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change but also promote sustainability by supporting food security and reducing the global demand for water, land, and fertilizer necessary for energy production and negative emissions.

Abstract Excessive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) have caused the greenhouse effect and environmental crisis. Therefore, the carbon reduction and negative carbon technologies are particularly important. Among these, the negative carbon technologies that convert CO 2 into carbon materials or carbon‐based chemicals for reuse have attracted significant attention. However, the strong double covalent bonds make the CO 2 conversion usually require harsh conditions, complex processes, and high energy consumption. Gallium‐based liquid metals (LMs) are the functional materials with both metallic and liquid properties, exhibiting a unique liquid‐phase structure and diverse surface characteristics. Herein, a strategy for reducing CO 2 is proposed to carbon materials by utilizing the spontaneous phase transition and mechanical friction of liquid metals. The gallium (Ga) and indium (In) particles are mixed and exposed to CO 2 , the contact interface of metal particles spontaneously transforms into liquid metals. The system has multistage interfaces, including Ga/In, Ga/eGaIn, and In/eGaIn, capable of generating triboelectrification upon mechanical stimulation, leading to charge transfer. The high electric field generated by friction at the contact interface directly reduces CO 2 to carbon materials at room temperature. The carbon materials cover the surface of eGaIn and can be directly stripped for used as fuel, or industrial applications.

Cities are key areas for carbon control and reduction. The study of the decoupling between CO2 emissions and gross domestic product (GDP) and the drivers of CO2 emissions in cities facilitates the reduction of CO2 emissions to safeguard the development of the economy. This paper first calculates the CO2 emissions in Tianjin, China, from 2005 to 2022, then uses the Tapio decoupling index to quantify the decoupling status, and, finally, explores the energy-CO2-emission drivers through the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model. The findings indicate that (1) the decrease in CO2 emissions from industrial products and transport is the main reason for the decline. (2) During the period under investigation, the predominant condition observed was a state of weak decoupling. (3) Given the economic-output effect is the primary and substantial driver of energy CO2 emissions, it is essential to harmonize the interplay between economic-development approach and CO2 emissions to foster sustainable development in Tianjin. The industrial structure plays the most critical role in hindering the reduction of CO2 emissions; therefore, optimizing industrial structure can help achieve carbon reduction and control targets. These findings enrich the study of CO2 emission factors and can also interest urban policymakers.

Abstract The era of an energy economy driven by “carbon neutrality” is putting forward stricter requirements for the use of carbon resources and the governance of CO 2 . Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide reaction (CO 2 RR), driven by renewable energy, is a practical energy storage technology with broad application prospects. It can reduce CO 2 into carbon‐based fuels and chemical products. Among them, multi‐carbon (C 2+ ) products have higher energy density and larger market size, and can significantly reduce the global demand for fossil fuels and close the artificial carbon cycle. Introducing additional active sites into Cu‐based catalysts to prepare dual‐site tandem catalysts can regulate the electronic and geometric structure of the catalysts, break linear scale relationships, reduce reaction potential barriers, and bring superb and stable catalytic performance. Various types of dual‐site tandem catalysts are developed, and the understanding of the tandem effect is pushed to a higher level. This paper reviews several typical dual‐site tandem catalysts: atom–atom dual‐site tandem catalysts, atom‐particle dual‐site tandem catalysts, particle–particle dual‐site tandem catalysts, and heterogeneous interface dual‐site tandem catalysts. It then deeply analyzes the reaction mechanism and research progress of these advanced catalysts in CO 2 RR. In addition, the challenges and opportunities faced by such catalysts are also discussed.

The urgent demand for efficient CO2 reduction technologies has driven enormous studies into the enhancement of advanced catalysts. Here, we investigate the electronic properties and CO2 adsorption properties of CumAgn bimetallic clusters, particularly Cu4Ag1, Cu1Ag4, Cu3Ag2, and Cu2Ag3, using generalized gradient approximation (GGA)/density functional theory (DFT). Our results show that the atomic arrangement within these clusters drastically affects their stability, charge transfer, and catalytic performance. The Cu4Ag1 bimetallic cluster emerges as the most stable structure, revealing superior charge transfer and effective chemisorption of CO2, which promotes effective activation of the CO2 molecule. In contrast, the Cu1Ag4 bimetallic cluster, in spite of comparable adsorption energy, indicates insignificant charge transfer, resulting in less pronounced CO2 activation. The Cu3Ag2 and Cu2Ag3 bimetallic clusters also display high adsorption energies with remarkable charge transfer mechanisms, emphasizing the crucial role of metal composition in tuning catalytic characteristics. This thorough examination provides constructive insights into the design of bimetallic clusters for boosted CO2 reduction. These findings could pave the way for the development of cost-effective and efficient catalysts for industrial CO2 reduction, contributing to global efforts in carbon management and climate change mitigation.

The energy sector is the largest contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions. To address the current climate emergency however, energy market actors (e.g., energy providers, nongovernmental organizations, policy makers) try to make individual consumers take responsibility for achieving an overall net balance of zero greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this research is to understand this process of responsibilization and its implications. The research method is a narrative discourse analysis of hundreds of public documents by energy market actors. The findings show that market actors try to shape ordinary consumers into “net-zero heroes” with responsibility for emissions reduction but end up creating a tragedy when they translate their collective agenda. These findings have implications for consumer responsibilization specifically and the conversion of agendas into action more generally. Theoretically, this research shows (1) the influence of the translation stage in the agenda-to-action chain, (2) the way market actors attempt to form net-zero heroes, and (3) the limited usefulness of the hero narrative. Practically, the research explains the implications of making consumers solely responsible for the emissions reduction problem.

The establishment of a more realistic CO2 fracturing model serves to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying CO2 fracturing transformation. Additionally, it furnishes a foundational framework for devising comprehensive fracturing construction plans. However, current research has neglected to consider the influence of CO2 on rock properties during CO2 fracturing, resulting in an inability to precisely replicate the alterations in the reservoir post-CO2 injection into the formation. This disparity from the actual conditions poses a substantial limitation to the application and advancement of CO2 fracturing technology. This work integrates variations in the physical parameters of rocks after complete contact and reaction with CO2 into the numerical model of crack propagation. This comprehensive approach fully acknowledges the impact of pre-CO2 exposure on the mechanical parameters of reservoir rocks. Consequently, it authentically restores the reservoir state following CO2 injection, ensuring a more accurate representation of the post-fracturing conditions. In comparison with conventional numerical simulation methods, the approach outlined in this paper yields a reduction in the error associated with predicting fracturing pressure by 9.8%.

Abstract Given the urgency to transition to low carbon future, oil refineries need to identify feasible strategies for decarbonisation. One way to address this is by integrating renewable energy systems. However, the high initial costs and intermittency appeared to be the key barriers for the adoption of renewable energy technologies. Hence, a multi-period optimisation model is developed via mixed integer linear programming in this work to determine the optimal renewable energy system in terms of cost and its optimal energy storage technology to enhance its flexibility for oil refinery operations. This model aims to minimise the costs of the renewable energy system while considering its ability to accommodate the varying energy demands across the time periods. An oil refinery case study is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model. The developed model is expected to propose an optimal renewable energy system that meets the energy demands and, at the same time, achieves the decarbonisation goal. Based on the results, the optimal renewable energy system comprises cost-effective technologies to generate various energy outputs including electricity, hydrogen, high-pressure and medium-pressure steam to meet energy demands. Additionally, the result of the case study shows that the integration of renewable energy systems achieves a reduction of 5,353 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Apart from that, the incorporation of energy-efficient energy storage results in a 10% reduction in the total cost of the optimal renewable energy system. Compressed hydrogen gas storage and battery were used to store excess hydrogen and electricity during periods with low demands and subsequently consumed during peak demand periods. This can, therefore, reduce the technological capacity required. With the aid of storage facilities, the flexibility of the renewable energy system is elevated in meeting varied demands, which otherwise would incur additional expenses.

Solar light‐driven conversion of CO2 into chemicals with high calorific value is regarded as an up‐and‐coming carbon utilization technology for alleviating the energy crisis. This technique faces the challenge of low CO2 conversion and product yield due to charge recombination in the catalyst. In this paper, a dual‐reaction‐site heterojunction catalyst was designed and fabricated by combining NiO with Bi3O4Br nanosheets, for the separation of CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation semireactions, which effectively promoted electrons and holes separation. The resulting catalyst exhibited a high CH4 production rate (8.12 μmol/g) and selectivity (94.69%). Electron distribution and band structure were investigated to explain the satisfactory catalytic performance. In addition, combining the in‐situ DRIFTS results, a formic acid‐intermediated CO2‐to‐CH4 reaction pathway was proposed. This work aims to pave the way for CH4 production via CO2 photoreduction with high efficiency and selectivity.

Abstract Resin concrete, which has high strength, high early strength development and excellent chemical resistance, has been widely applied for repair and reinforcement of concrete structures, and precast products since the 1950’s. The research and development of resin concrete in Japan have evolved in tandem with various regions and international activities. It is a common and indispensable material for infrastructures in the world at present. On the other hand, there are so many different Acts of God, such as earthquakes, typhoons, and torrential rains, that occur in Japan, and disaster measures are an important issue. In this paper, the current status and practical application of resin concrete mainly applied for sewage products in Japan were investigated and discussed. Based on the regional characteristics of Japan, a resin concrete manhole of high quality to compensate for the defects of cement concrete was developed. Furthermore, the future trends in the research and development of resin concrete including environmental issues such as carbon dioxide emissions reduction, application of recycled materials and bioplastics to replace natural aggregates and petroleum-derived resin for concrete are proposed and discussed. A homogenization analysis method is introduced particularly to bring out the ability of resin concrete as composite materials and to carry out material development efficiently.

CO2 electroreduction is a potential pathway to achieve net-zero emissions in the chemical industry. Yet, CO2 loss, resulting from (bi)carbonate formation, renders the process energy-intensive. Acidic environments can address the issue but at the expense of compromised product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs), particularly for multi-carbon (C2+) products, as rapid diffusion and migration of protons (H+) favors competing H2 and CO production. Here, we present a strategy of tuning the 2-position substituent length on benzimidazole (BIM)-based copper (Cu) coordination polymer (CuCP) precatalyst – to enhance CO2 reduction to C2+ products in acidic environments. Lengthening the substituent from H to nonyl enhances H+ diffusion retardation and decreases Cu-Cu coordination numbers (CNs), favoring further reduction of CO. This leads to a nearly 24× enhancement of selectivity towards CO hydrogenation and C-C coupling at 60 mA cm−2. We report the highest C2+ product FE of more than 70% at 260 mA cm−2 on pentyl-CuCP and demonstrate a CO2-to-C2+ single-pass conversion (SPC) of ~54% at 180 mA cm−2 using pentyl-CuCP in zero-gap electrolyzers. Acidic CO2 electroreduction suffers poor selectivity for multi-carbon products. Here, the authors report that lengthening the 2-position substituents of benzimidazole-based copper coordination polymer precatalysts retards H+ diffusion, reduces Cu-Cu coordination numbers, and promotes C-C coupling.

Flow cells featuring a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) have emerged as an attractive platform for electrochemical CO2 reduction, offering high current densities (~300 mA·cm−2) and low energy consumption. However, the formation of salt precipitates, particularly carbonate and bicarbonate, poses a significant deficiency by reducing the cell’s operational longevity. In this study, we present a novel approach to mitigate salt precipitates in real-time through acid–base interaction. Recovery efficiency and partial current density of the cell were used to evaluate the capability of removing salt precipitates and the maintenance of CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs). It was suggested that the direct treatment of intermittent acid rinse recovers the performance of CO2RRs to a large extent (>97%), and the modification of the proton exchange resin reduces the reduction rate of partial current densities to 1/15 than that of the unmodified. This improvement enhances the cell’s catalytic performance, enabling the stability test for catalysts within the GDE-based flow cell.

Looking at pasture-based beef cattle production systems, there needs to be more pasture management and low zootechnical indexes, which culminate in low productivity and environmental impact. In this sense, cattle farming has been labeled as harmful to the environment due to the emission of gases that can contribute to the excessive increase in the greenhouse effect. These gases are methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide, which come from ruminal fermentation, manure fermentation, and biomass management. The objective was to simulate eight scenarios: the first occurred in areas of degradation and desertification of pastures induced by livestock farming, the second occurred with the recovery of degraded pasture areas, the third occurred with the improvement of pasture management, the fourth occurred with the implementation of integrated production systems, the fifth occurred with the improvement in diet quality, the sixth occurred with the association of supplementation strategies for grazing cattle with fattening in confinement, the seventh occurred with the reduction in the feeding cycle production of beef cattle and the eighth occurred with the intensification of land use. It is concluded that the adoption of more intensive production systems proves to be more efficient, both productively and environmentally, by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and improving zootechnical indices, guaranteeing the supply of animal protein in the face of growing demand globally.

A series of development technologies of "horizontal well plus volume fracturing" have been established to achieve an annual output of one million tons of crude oil in 7 the Mahu tight conglomerate reservoir. However, such oil fields generally face problems such as rapid pressure drop, rapid production decline, difficulty in water injection, and gas channeling, seriously affecting the beneficial development of tight conglomerate reservoirs. To solve these problems, in this study, we carried out the feasibility experiment of different gas injection developments and the potential evaluation of enhanced oil recovery based on the combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulation. The results show that CO2, rich gas, and dry gas can be miscible with crude oil in X oilfield under the original formation conditions. Both CO2 and hydrocarbon gas have expansion and viscosity reduction abilities. Under the same mole fraction of injected gas, the volume expansion ability and viscosity reduction ability of CO2 to crude oil are 2.14 and 2.25 times that of hydrocarbon gas, respectively. Numerical simulation results show that the well pattern suitable for gas injection and energy supplement is a vertical well injection and horizontal well production, and the angle between the horizontal well direction and the horizontal maximum principal stress direction is between 0° and 30°. Both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations show that the CO2 injection medium has the best recovery effect, which can increase the recovery rate by 13.8% compared with the depletion development. This research provides insights into the effective development of tight conglomerate reservoirs.

Abstract In 2023, sea-surface temperatures (SST) reached record highs. Based on historical responses, this SST anomaly would suggest an increased oceanic CO2 uptake (-0.11±0.03 PgC yr-1). In contrast, our observation-based estimates reveal that the global non-polar ocean absorbed about 10% less carbon than expected (+0.16±0.28 PgC yr-1). This weakening occurred despite reduced CO2 outgassing in the tropics associated with El Niño. Hence, the decline in CO2 uptake in 2023 materialised entirely in the extratropics, driven primarily by elevated SSTs in the Northern Hemisphere. Two ocean biogeochemical models demonstrate that in the subtropical North Atlantic the thermally-induced reduction in CO2 uptake was strongly mitigated by the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface mixed layer. Such negative feedbacks cause an overall muted response of the ocean carbon sink to the record high SSTs, but this resilience may not persist under long-term warming or more severe SST extremes.

As advanced sensors and weapons require high power, naval vessels have increasingly adopted electric propulsion systems. This study aims to enhance the efficiency and operability of electric propulsion systems over traditional mechanical propulsion systems by analyzing the operational profiles of modern naval vessels. Consequently, a battery-integrated generator-based electric propulsion system was selected. Considering the purpose of the vessel, a specification selection procedure was developed, leading to the design of a hybrid electric propulsion system (comprising one battery and four generators). The power management control technique of the proposed propulsion system sets the operating modes (depending on the specific fuel oil consumption of the generators) to minimize fuel consumption based on the operating load. Additionally, load distribution control rules for the generators were designed to reduce energy consumption based on the load and battery state of charge. MATLAB/Simulink was used to evaluate the proposed system, with simulation results demonstrating that it maintained the same propulsion performance as existing systems while achieving a 12-ton (22%) reduction in fuel consumption. This improvement results in cost savings and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. These findings suggest that an efficient load-sharing controller can be implemented for various vessels equipped with electric propulsion systems, tailored to their operational profiles.

The present work is devoted to assessing the effect of heat treatment of iron oxide catalysts promoted by potassium and cerium on their activity, which is expressed quantitatively in the form of methylbutenes conversion, and selectivity in the process of methylbutenes dehydrogenation to isoprene, and interpreting the results obtained using kinetic modeling. Iron oxide catalysts were prepared by heat treatment of iron (II) hydroxide Fe(OH)2. The concentrations of the components of the reaction mixture, the conversion of methylbutenes and selectivity were experimentally determined during methylbutenes dehydrogenation in the presence of heat-treated iron oxide catalysts. It has been shown that an increase of α-Fe2O3 hematite phase in the iron oxide catalyst helps to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide and cracking products in the products of the methylbutenes dehydrogenation, which contributes to increased selectivity. The increase of α-Fe2O3 hematite phase is observed with increasing heat treatment temperature from 298 K to 873 K. In all iron oxide catalysts promoted by potassium and cerium, after the methylbutenes dehydrogenation, the main phase is magnetite Fe3O4 (62.17% by wt.) and a more reduced form of iron oxide wustite FeO (13.81% by wt.) was identified. It can be assumed that the reduction of iron oxides in the iron oxide catalyst during the methylbutenes dehydrogenation is associated with the activity of the catalyst. The higher the activity of the iron oxide catalyst, the higher the concentration of hydrogen in the reaction mixture, which leads to a deeper reduction of iron oxide. As a result of kinetic modeling, it was demonstrated that the kinetic scheme, consisting of the reactions of methylbutene isomers dehydrogenation, isomerization of methylbutenes, cracking of methylbutene isomers and isoprene, interaction of coke with water, is complete enough to adequately describe the experimental data of the methylbutenes dehydrogenation.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) offers the opportunity to store renewable energy in the form of chemicals and fuels while simultaneously reducing CO2 emissions. Compared to low‐carbon products such as carbon monoxide and formic acid, multicarbon products have demonstrated greater value in terms of economic feasibility. To date, various strategies have been developed to enhance electrocatalytic performance, with tandem strategies emerging as a promising approach, particularly for the formation of multicarbon products. In this review, current tandem strategies regarding CO2RR are thoroughly discussed, covering electrocatalyst designs from atomic‐scale tandem electrocatalysts to macroscale electrode configurations as well as reaction system designs. Additionally, the internal reaction processes involving reduction product upgrades, the application of multi‐physical tandem fields, and the tandem reaction systems are further summarized. This review aims to provide more fundamental insights into tandem strategies for CO2RR applications and inspire more creative ideas in the research community of CO2RR in light of this promising approach with its wide versatility, diversity and flexibility.

Biodiesel is a promising alternative fuel that represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source. Due to its complete carbon cycle, it reduces dependence on fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. However, the use of biodiesel in diesel engines is associated with several challenges, including an increase in nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions, incompatibility with cold climates, and lower calorific value. By using nanoparticles as fuel additives, there is a potential to improve the properties of biodiesel and address its shortcomings. In this work, the characteristics of biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil have been enhanced using nanoparticle additives, which result in the usage of a higher percentage of the biodiesel in diesel engines. Nanoparticles of cerium oxide, silicon dioxide, and aluminum oxide have been investigated in different concentrations as biodiesel additives. Two mathematical models are introduced in this work and solved by LINGO optimization software (version 18); the first one seeks to predict the characteristics of biodiesel with nanoparticles in any blend of diesel–biodiesel–nanoparticles, while the second model aims to maximize the biodiesel ratio in a biodiesel–diesel–nanoparticles blend. The application of the combined two models aids in the selection of the optimal nanomaterial that improves the properties of biodiesel and permits an increase in the biodiesel mixing ratio in the fuel. The results show that the best nanoparticle type is cerium oxide at a concentration of 100 ppm, and the optimal mixing ratio of biodiesel blended with CeO2 nanoparticles is 24.892%. An unmodified diesel engine is operated and evaluated with the optimum blend (24.892% biodiesel + 75.108% petrol diesel + 100 ppm CeO2 nanoparticles). It is found that significant improvements in engine performance and emissions compared with the conventional diesel are achieved. The reductions in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), smoke opacity, and carbon monoxide emissions are 24%, 52%, and 30%, respectively.

Abstract An increasing amount of effort has been directed to ensure the minimization of carbon dioxide emissions within the transport industry, particularly in the light passenger vehicle segments. This has been achieved through many advancements such as mass and aerodynamic drag reduction as well as the electrification of powertrains. The heavy-duty vehicle segment contributes significantly to the total emissions of the transport sector, however fuel consumption through electrification poses some limitations. Fuel efficiency has been achieved by adopting higher fuel injection pressures generating an increase of the crankshaft nose oscillation making Front-End Accessory Drive (FEAD) design more challenging. This paper provides a solution, with the incorporation of a crank pulley decoupler that isolates the irregularities from the FEAD that arise at the crank of the internal combustion engine. The analysis of a 12.7 L engine tested with a steel pulley and with the decoupler is presented. The brake-specific fuel consumption map is obtained for the engine mounted with the steel pulley and with the decoupler through a dynamometer test. The engine maps are incorporated into a tractor trailer with a 4 × 2 configuration in the Vehicle Energy consumption Tool (VECTO), evaluated over three driving cycles: long-haul delivery, regional delivery, and urban delivery. The outcome indicates a maximum relative fuel saving of 0.63% for a vehicle mounted with a decoupler compared to one mounted with a solid steel pulley.

Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3‐ under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy‐intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre‐incorporating [V10O28]6‐ into NH2‐MIL‐101‐Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL‐n can efficiently drive co‐reduction of NO3‐ and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4 mmol h‐1 gcat‐1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with ‐NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3‐ and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO4 nanocluster within a NH2‐framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O2/N2.

Abstract Carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage (CCS) is essential in achieving the net-zero target. Despite this increasing recognition, current CCS deployments are far behind targeted ambitions. A key reason is that CCS is often perceived as too expensive. While assessments of the costs of CCS have traditionally looked at impact at the plant level, the present study seeks to understand the costs and environmental benefits that will be passed to consumers via end-products and services. In particular, nine end-products/services (bridge construction, electricity from onshore wind power, electricity from offshore wind power, transport of a container via ship, a magazine, the production and transport of an avocado, a beer can, waste treatment via waste-to-energy, and long-distance air travel) connected to ten potential areas of application for CCS (cement production, iron and steel production, oil and gas production, natural gas processing, refining, ship propulsion engines, pulp and paper production, urea production, waste-to-energy, and direct air capture).&#xD;The evaluations highlight that significant emission reductions (beyond 50 %) could be achieved at marginal costs for end-users in six end-products/services: bridge construction, electricity from onshore wind power, electricity from offshore wind power, transport by ship, magazine, and waste treatment. Moderate emission reductions (between 11 and 37%) could be achieved in two cases at virtually no cost (increase below 1%): beer can and avocado production. Finally, only the case of using direct air capture to compensate for emissions from air travel was found to raise the cost for end-users significantly.&#xD;Although more research is still needed in this area, this work broadens our understanding of the real cost and benefits of CCS and provides useful insights for decision-makers and society.

Abstract. Coastal acidification, warming, and nutrient management actions all alter water quality conditions that marine species experience, with potential impacts to their physiological processes. Decreases in calcite saturation state (ΩCa) and food availability, combined with warming water temperatures, pose a threat to calcifying organisms; however, the magnitude of future changes in estuarine systems is challenging to predict and is not well known. This study aims to determine how and where oysters will be affected by future acidification, warming, and nutrient reductions, and the relative effects of these stressors. To address these goals, an oyster bioenergetics model for Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) was embedded in a 3-D coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemistry model implemented for two tributaries in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Model simulations were forced with projected future conditions (mid-21st century atmospheric CO2, atmospheric temperature, and managed nutrient reductions) and compared with a realistic present-day reference run. Together, all three stressors are projected to reduce ΩCa and growth of oyster shell and tissue. Increased atmospheric CO2 and temperature are both projected to cause widespread reductions in ΩCa. The resulting reductions in oyster shell and tissue growth will be most severe along the tributary shoals. Future warming during peak oyster growing seasons is projected to have the strongest negative influence on tissue and shell growth, due to summer water temperatures reducing filtration rates, enhancing shell dissolution and oyster respiration rates, and increasing organic matter remineralization rates, thus reducing food availability. Nutrient reductions will exacerbate deficits in oyster food availability, contributing to further reductions in growth. Quantifying the effects of these stressors provides insight on the areas in the lower bay where oysters will be most vulnerable to mid 21st-century conditions.    

    

## Real-Time Estimation of CO2 Absorption Capacity Using Ionic Conductivity of Protonated Di-Methyl-Ethanolamine (DMEA) and Electrical Conductivity in Low-Concentration DMEA Aqueous Solutions

The present study investigates the real-time estimation of CO2 absorption capacity (CAC) based on the electrical conductivity (EC) of low-concentration di-methyl-ethanolamine (DMEA) solutions (0.1–0.5 M). CO2 absorption experiments are conducted to measure the variation in CAC and EC during CO2 absorption, revealing a strong correlation between the two properties. The ionic conductivity of DMEAH+ formed during absorption is calculated to be 53.1 S·cm2/(mol·z), which is found to be larger than that of TEAH+ and MDEAH+. This can be attributed to the smaller molar mass and higher ionic mobility of DMEAH+. A significant finding is that the measured EC (ECM) of the DMEA solutions consistently demonstrates a lower value than the theoretically predicted value. This discrepancy is due to the larger ionic size of DMEAH+, which results in a reduction in the real mean ionic activity coefficient. This effect becomes more pronounced with increasing DMEA concentration. Consequently, a higher CAC is required to produce the same change in EC at higher amine concentrations. Based on these findings, an empirical equation is devised to estimate CAC from ECM in solutions of constant DMEA concentration. This equation will be employed as a practical approach for the in situ monitoring of CO2 absorption using DMEA aqueous solution.

Precise synthesis of carboxylic acids via catalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly appealing. Although considerable advancements have been achieved in difunctionalizing carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the asymmetric variants are conspicuously underdeveloped, particularly in addressing axially chiral alkenes. Herein, we report the first catalytic atroposelective carboxylation of alkynes with CO2. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo‐, regio‐, E/Z and enantio‐selectivities. Notably, an unexpected anti‐selective carbo‐carboxylation is observed in the sp2‐hybrid carbo‐electrophile‐initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies including DFT calculation elucidate the origin of chiral induction and anti‐selectivity in vinyl‐carboxylation of alkynes.

Abstract Although tobacco smoking declined among men at reproductive age, the use of cannabis increased. The aim of our study was to determine the impact of tobacco and cannabis on sperm quality, sperm DNA integrity tested by Chromomycin A3 (CMA3) and acridine orange (AO) and their association to genetic variants in the Cytochrome C Oxidase 1, 2 and 3 genes (MT-CO1, MT-CO2, and MT-CO3). Semen samples were collected and divided into 37 non-smokers (NS), 39 tobacco smokers (TS), and 37 cannabis smokers (CS). MT-CO1, MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced by Sanger. The results showed reductions in normal sperm morphology and non-progressive motility in TS and CS compared to NS (p < 0.001). However, immotile sperm, AO+, and CMA3 + scores were higher in the CS compared to TS and NS (p < 0.001). Twenty-three nucleotide substitutions (SNPs) detected in the MT-CO1 gene, 15 SNPs detected in the MT-CO2 gene, and 30 SNPs detected in the MT-CO3 gene. None of these SNPs was different between the three groups. Tobacco and cannabis smoking altered the motility and morphology of the spermatozoa and sperm DNA integrity but was not associated with genetic variants in the MT-CO1, MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 genes.

For presentation at the 70th AVS International Symposium and Exhibition. In this work, we show that the activity of Ag electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 to CO conversion is improved when supported on sulfur-doped (S-doped) carbon materials. S-doped carbon support was created by treating the heavily sputtered, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in H2S at elevated temperatures, as confirmed by the S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peak. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images indicated that Ag nanoparticles supported on S-doped HOPG had similar size distributions as those supported on sulfur-free (S-free) HOPG. While both catalysts reached > 90% CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) at E = -1.3 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), Ag catalysts supported on S-doped HOPG demonstrated 70% higher CO turnover frequency (TOFCO = 3.4 CO/atomAg/s) than those supported on S-free HOPG (TOFCO = 2.0 CO/atomAg/s). Preliminary calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) indicated a more favorable energetic pathway of CO2-to-CO at the C-S-Ag interface, tentatively consistent with experiments. These results hint at a new approach to design active and selective electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion.

Sex differences exist in the integrative response to exercise, however, these are typically researched during constant-load exercise. Interval exercise involves high-intensity efforts interspersed with recovery periods to repeatedly stress physiological systems, and it is currently unknown whether the response to this form of exercise differs between sexes. Ten males and ten females (age: 25 +/- 3 years) completed two experimental visits. First, an incremental treadmill exercise test was performed to obtain submaximal (lactate threshold) and maximal (VO2peak) data. Thereafter, visit two involved 4 x 3-min running intervals at 90% of the final incremental test velocity (vVO2peak), with 90 secs rest between intervals. Before exercise and after each interval, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), quadriceps potentiated twitch (Qtw.pot), and voluntary activation (VA) were recorded. The rates of oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and ventilation (VE) were continuously recorded throughout. There was no sex difference in relative VO2peak (males: 47.2 +/- 6.0 vs. females: 44.4 +/- 5.8 ml.kg-1.min-1, p=0.292). When expressed relative to peak values, there were no sex differences in the VO2 or VCO2 response to the interval task (p greater than or equal to 0.781). Females had greater VE, VE/VO2, and VE/VCO2 values during the first two intervals (p less than or equal to 0.046). There were no sex differences in the reductions in MVC, Qtw.pot, and VA during the interval task (p greater than or equal to 0.150), however females had lesser reductions in Qtw.pot values post-exercise (-24 +/- 9 vs. -15 +/- 8%, p=0.044). Sex differences exist in the physiological response to interval exercise. Compared to males, females experienced greater hyperpnoea during the initial stages, and had lesser decreases in contractile function post-exercise.

The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has become a critical global issue, particularly in response to climate change. This study aims to analyse the trends in energy consumption and CO2 emissions within Iran's household sector. The findings reveal a significant increase in energy consumption in Iran between 2001 and 2019. Despite the household sector's heavy reliance on fossil fuels, a shift in fuel consumption patterns can be observed, with a transition from oil to natural gas starting in 2008. Electricity generation in Iran is also predominantly fossil fuel-based, with natural gas playing a major role. This underscores the urgent need to reinforce renewable energy sources to mitigate CO2 emissions from the household sector. Another key factor influencing energy consumption in Iran is the country's extensive energy subsidies. The disparity in fuel prices compared to neighbouring countries has also led to fuel smuggling. However, the results show that the twophase subsidy reform plan implemented in 2010 and 2013 did not lead to a reduction in energy consumption. Therefore, further reforms are needed to improve energy equity and reduce CO2 emissions in the household sector.

To achieve carbon neutrality in 2050, Thailand has focused on reducing CO2 emissions in the energy sector. Small modular reactors (SMRs) and renewable energy such as wind and solar represent an interesting alternative for the decarbonization of the energy sector. This study aims to investigate the possibility of establishing a grid-connected hybrid energy system (Grid/Solar PV/Wind Turbine/BESS/SMRs) to fulfill the energy demand of Phuket Island in Thailand and to minimize net present cost (NPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions. A grid-connected hybrid renewable generation system was simulated using HOMER. Four combinations of grid-connected and renewable energy sources were developed based on the electricity demand and renewable resources available at the site. The simulation results indicate that the most optimal scenario is the Grid/PV/WT/SMR system, which offers a 28% reduction in NPC and LCOE compared to the grid-only system and reduces CO2 emissions by over 58% compared to the total emissions from the utility grid. The simulation results demonstrate that the grid-connected and hybrid energy system is the most viable option to meet electricity demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on Phuket Island.

Soil mineralization is a crucial soil process that improves soil physical properties, enhances carbon sequestration, and provides essential minerals and available nutrients for plant growth. This study was conducted at five vegetation types and soil depths at Luot mountain area, located in VNUF campus, Hanoi city. Samples were incubated in the dark at 25°C and measured at intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, and 40 days in the laboratory to determine C-CO2 respiration from soils. The study showed that CO2 emissions were highest in topsoils and decreased with deeper soil depths. Mineralized C-CO2 decreased from Shrubs > Acacia + Native species (NS) > Pinus + NS > Native species > Control. CO2 emissions peaked early in the incubation period and then stabilized in the 40-day incubation period. Larger aggregates (≥ 5mm) decreased significantly under most vegetation types, except for Shrubs, where the reduction was minimal. Aggregate size ≥3mm increased post-incubation, notably under Pinus + NS and Native species, with smaller aggregates also increasing slightly. Organic matter content was highest in the topsoil but decreased post-incubation due to microbial C mineralization. There was an increase in soil organic matter at 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers after incubation, especially under Shrubs. Available nitrogen slightly increased in soils post-incubation for most vegetation types. Phosphorus content increased post-incubation, peaking under Shrubs, while potassium levels were generally poor but increased during incubation. The study found that C-CO2 mineralization was strongly associated with soil porosity and pH, suggesting that higher porosity and optimal pH enhance mineralization, with organic matter content being crucial for available nutrient cycles in soils.

The use of renewable solar energy for the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has garnered significant interest owing to its dual benefits: reducing the greenhouse effect and producing high-energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Transition metals play a crucial role in catalyzing the CO2RR; however, their scarcity and high cost pose challenges in achieving sustainable chemistry. In this study, we developed a metal-free CO2RR catalytic system using triazolium, a small and structurally simple compound, as the key catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of a solution containing a carbazole photosensitizer and triazolium salt under 1 atm pressure of CO2 afforded formate in high yield at room temperature. No other reduced products of CO2 were detected. The turnover number of the catalyst exceeded 2300, indicating high catalytic activity and durability. Mechanistic studies revealed that the triazolium salt serves as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst, with a carbon-centered radical as the catalytically active species. A study on the relationship between the chemical structure and the catalytic activity of various triazolium analogs elucidated the essential structural properties required for carbon-centered HAT catalysts. The results provide valuable insights for future research on CO2RR utilizing transition metal-free organic molecules as catalysts, which could contribute to environmentally friendly and sustainable methods.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to alleviate the energy crisis and CO2 pollution, for which a wide variety of catalysts are under development. Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) with clear and designable structures are an excellent platform for ECR. Here, two isostructural N, O‐coordinated Zn‐MOFs, FJU‐126‐4F and FJU‐126‐CH3, based on terephthalic acid ligand with different groups (one is ‐4F, the other is ‐CH3) on the benzene ring, have been constructed for ECR catalysts. Significantly, the different functional groups make the performance difference of ECR. The maximum Faraday efficiency of formate (FEformate) for FJU‐126‐4F is 60.5% with the partial current density of formate (jformate) of ‐19.35 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.47 V, while the optimum FEformate of FJU‐126‐CH3 is 50.2% with the jformate of ‐10.04 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.57 V. The work provides insight into the rational design of MOF catalysts for ECR.

Environmental degradation remains a significant global challenge, particularly in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries. This study primarily examines the impact of Islamic finance, proxied by two indicators, namely Islamic financial assets and Islamic banking financing, and other variables including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), urbanization, renewable energy adoption, and forest area, on CO2 emissions. This study revealed that Islamic financial assets had a negative impact on CO2 emissions, highlighting their importance in supporting green investments and sustainability. However, Islamic banking financing has little influence on emissions reduction, most likely due to carbon-intensive initiatives. Furthermore, GDP growth increases emissions, although FDI, urbanization, and forest areas help to lower them. These findings underscore Islamic finance's critical role in fostering sustainable development, as well as the necessity for better green Islamic financing policies in OIC member nations. The findings also provide important insights for policymakers working to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability in Islamic finance.

In this study, the thermodynamic analysis of a combined cycle gas turbine integrated with post-combustion carbon capture and storage using the solvent method is performed. The syngas obtained from the gasification of sewage sludge is mixed with methane and nitrogen-rich natural gas fuels at different proportions, used in the gas turbine, and the properties of fuel and flue gases are analyzed. The flue gas obtained from the fuel mixture is passed through the post-combustion carbon capture and storage at various load conditions to assess the heat and electricity required for the carbon capture process. The solvent used for the carbon capture from flue gases enables CO2 capture with the high efficiency of 90%. With the calculated results, the load conditions of flue gas using fuel mixtures are identified, which reduces the heat and power demand of post-combustion carbon capture and storage and provides the possibility to achieve neutral emission. The impact of selected operating conditions of post-combustion carbon capture and storage on the CO2 emission reduction process and on the power plant performances is investigated. Considering the factors of electricity generation, energy efficiency, heat supply to the consumers, operating load of post-combustion carbon cap-ture and storage and CO2 emission, the 50% mixture of syngas with both fuels performs better. Also, the use of a mixture of 2-amino-2methyl-1-propanol and piperazine with reboiler duty 3.7 MJ/kgCO2 in post-combustion carbon capture and storage slightly enhanced the performance of the power plant compared to the use of monoethanolamine with reboiler duty 3.8 MJ/kgCO2.

In recent years, the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has increased significantly, contributing to global warming. Among these GHGs, CH4, CO2, and CO are particularly potent contributors. Remediation techniques primarily rely on materials capable of capturing, storing, and converting these gases. Catalytic processes, particularly heterogeneous catalysis, are essential to chemical and petrochemical industries as well as environmental remediation. Due to the growing demand for catalysts, efforts are being made to reduce energy consumption and make technologies more environmentally friendly. Green chemistry emphasizes minimizing the use of hazardous reactants and harmful solvents in chemical processes. Achieving these principles should be paired with processes that reduce time and costs in catalyst preparation while improving their efficiency. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) has been widely used for the preparation of supported metal catalysts. NTP has attracted significant attention for its ability to improve the physicochemical properties of catalysts, enhancing process efficiency through low-temperature operation and shorter processing times. NTP has been applied to various catalyst synthesis techniques, including reduction, oxidation, metal oxide doping, surface etching, coating, alloy formation, surface treatment, and surface cleaning. Plasma-prepared transition-metal catalysts offer advantages over conventionally prepared catalysts due to their unique material properties. These properties enhance catalytic activity by lowering the activation energy barrier, improving stability, and increasing conversion and selectivity compared to untreated samples. This review demonstrates how plasma activation modifies material properties and, based on extensive literature, illustrates its potential to combat climate change by converting CO2, CH4, CO, and other gases, showcasing the benefits of plasma-treated materials and catalysts. A succinct introduction to this review outlines the advantages of plasma-based synthesis and modification over traditional synthesis techniques. The introduction also highlights the various types of plasma and their physical characteristics across different factors. Additionally, this review addresses methods by which materials are synthesized and modified using plasma. The latter section of this review discusses the use of non-thermal plasma for greenhouse gas mitigation, covering applications such as the dry reforming of CH4, CO and CH4 oxidation, CO2 reduction, and other uses of plasma-modified catalysts.

Boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDDEs) offer a highly efficient pathway to mineralize recalcitrant compounds due to their reduced energy requirements, fewer chemical inputs, and mechanical stability. In this work, the electrochemical degradation of paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) was studied using an undivided cell (Condiacell®-type) at circumneutral pH, and under galvanostatic control. The roles of applied current density, volumetric flow rate, and herbicide concentration were systematically studied through a central composite design (CCD) using a closed-flow reaction setup. Under the best operating conditions (i.e., for PQ: 1.6 mA/cm2, 80 mL/min, and 70 mL/min, and 70 mg/L; and for DQ: 1.5 mA/cm2, 80 mL/min, and 73 mg/L), a spectrophotometric analysis evidenced that the herbicides were satisfactorily removed (ca. 100%) while mineralization degrees were above 90%. Furthermore, the produced effluents yielded significant increases in seed germination and root length, which suggest a reduction in toxicity. Energy consumptions of 0.13 and 0.18 kWh/g of TOC are reported with the electrochemical cells for the PQ and DQ treatments, respectively. The PQ and DQ treatments by electrooxidation are estimated to emit nearly 2.7 and 38.9 kg CO2/m3 of water treated, with a cost around USD 250/m3. Carbon emissions could be greatly decreased for PQ (0.28 kg CO2/m3) and DQ (0.40 kg CO2/m3) if electricity were generated from renewable resources. Although this study suggests that the use of BDDE can be considered as a green alternative for agrochemical removal due to lower carbon emissions, the environmental profile of the process is determined by the degree of renewability of the electrical grid of each country or region.

This study aims to assess the capability of using a specially designed device to monitor changes in gas concentration (CO2, NH3, H2S, and O2) in the atmosphere above the minced beef meat, during storage at refrigerated temperature. With its array of sensing channels, the multi-gas detector device facilitates the detection of precise gas concentrations in sensitive environments, enabling the monitoring of various processes occurring within stored meat. To delve into the connection between microbial activity and gas emissions during storage, fluctuations in microbial populations in the meat were observed, focusing on prevalent meat microbiota such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Enterobacteriaceae. A significant reduction of O2 content in the stored samples was observed after seven days (p < 0.05), while a significant release of CO2 was detected on the fourth day of storage. Significant changes (p < 0.05) in the gas content were tracked until the 11th day of storage followed by intensive microbial growth. NH3 and H2S levels remained undetectable throughout the experiment. The results showed a correlation between an increase in gas content in the headspace and an increase in the number of LAB and Enterobacteriaceae in meat. Modern multi-gas detector devices can indirectly determine microbial contamination in closed meat packaging.

Aggregates are the second-most consumed product in the world after water. This geological resource is used as building and construction material, and its production in quarries and delivery to customers generates several environmental problems. Their transport from quarries to consumption points, almost entirely done by truck, also generates impacts such as an increase in traffic and noise and the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Transportation and storage of goods account for 15% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and will increase significantly by 2050. To mitigate this, the European Union suggested shifting 30% of long-distance road freight to cleaner alternatives, such as rail or waterborne transport. This approach neglects the enormous volume of short-distance freight movement and its impact on achieving the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, the hypothesis to test is whether the use of an intermodal rail/road transport mode, instead of just roads, for the transport of some products can help reduce global CO2 emissions even for short distances. To test this, this study investigates the carbon emissions (and transport cost reduction) generated by rail/road intermodal aggregate transport for short distances in the Madrid region (Spain), rather than the currently used direct truck transport. An analysis of variables, such as aggregate supply, demand locations and amounts, and road and rail networks, using a geographical information system provides the associated carbon emissions of the different transport alternatives. To obtain a reduction in CO2 emissions, this study proposes the establishment of intermodal transfer facilities near consumption centers, where materials are primarily transported by rail, with road transport limited to the final delivery to consumption areas. The results anticipate a notable decrease in carbon emissions in aggregate transport and allow the establishment of more efficient and environmentally friendly rail/road intermodal transport that would help to meet the goals of reducing climate change while making the use of aggregates more environmentally friendly.

In analyzing the decoupling of emissions from economic growth, current literature foregoes the nonlinear complexities of macroeconomic systems, leading to ineffective energy transition policies, specifically for developing countries. This study focuses on the Indian energy–economy–emission nexus to establish a control system that internalizes inflation, trade openness, and fossil fuel imports with economic growth and macro-emissions to visualize the complex pathways of decoupling. Through long-term cointegration and vector error correction modeling, it was found that GDP and energy affect capital, inflation and energy imports, which are locked in a long-run negative feedback loop that ultimately increases emissions. Capital growth enables decoupling at 0.7% CO2 emissions reduction for every 1% capital growth, while 1% inflation growth inhibits decoupling by increasing CO2 emissions by 0.8%. A cybernetic fractional circuit of R-C elements and operational amplifiers was utilized to examine the delay of pulses from GDP to the loop elements, which revealed that capital is periodic with GDP pulses. However, inflation, being aperiodic with the clock pulses of GDP, causes the pulse-width of capital to decrease and fossil fuel imports to increase. Through the circuital model, it was possible to determine the exact policy intervention schedule in business cycle growth and recession phases that could build clean energy capital and limit inflation-induced recoupling.

This is the first review study that focuses on the interplay between China’s regulated and voluntary carbon markets, the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) scheme, and their combined influence on the development of renewable energy in the country. Through a comparative literature review of 52 peer-reviewed academic papers published between 2009 and 2024, this study aims to elucidate how these market mechanisms interact to drive renewable energy deployment. The findings indicate that both the ETS and the CCER system positively affect China’s renewable energy landscape. The ETS, with its Cap-and-Trade (CaT) mechanism, sets a cap on total emissions and allows for the trading of emission quotas, thereby creating financial incentives for companies to reduce emissions and invest in renewable energy. The CCER scheme complements the ETS by allowing companies to use the CCER scheme for a capped share of their ETS certificates, whereby the lower CCER price diverts investments to where the saved ton of CO2 in China is cheapest, further incentivizing investments in renewable energy. This dual mechanism allows for a more flexible and cost-effective approach to achieving emission reduction targets, thereby fostering an environment conducive to investment in renewable energy. It will stimulate additional investment in renewable energy projects in the long run, particularly in economically underdeveloped regions, contributing to both local economic development and national emission reduction targets.

With renewables growing at an unprecedented pace and critical carbon budget deadlines approaching, research is shifting to the new frontier of Paris aligned 1.5 °C mitigation pathways for hard-to-abate sectors, including the chemical industry sector. This is a significant challenge with chemical products such as plastics, fertilizers and many more products intertwined with today's society and with CO2 emissions originating both from energy and from chemical conversions. This paper presents a detailed bottom-up production-based energy and emission calculation to make a 1.5 °C compatible scenario for the chemical industry based on three main measures compared to a business-as-usual scenario. This research found that the holistic combination of demand and supply measures is critical to reduce the different types of emissions in the sector (energy and non-energy process emissions). An overall reduction of 82% of CO2 emissions in 2050 is calculated with a decrease in base chemical production growth (− 21%), 100% renewable energy for heat and electricity (− 50%) and the introduction of novel electrical-based and biomass-based production technologies for ethylene, propylene, methanol and ammonia (− 10%). Critical system developments include slowing chemical demand growth with recycling and circularity best practices, advanced electrification of heat supply and the substantial market penetration of the current most advanced sustainable production technologies for methanol, ammonia, and ethylene based on their reasonable technology maturation trajectories. Here, green methanol and ammonia will require 381 TWh in 2030 and 3232 TWh in 2050 for green hydrogen electrolysis, which will represent 1% and 4% of global electricity demand.

As global climate change accelerates, the need for precise and high-resolution carbon emission inventories becomes increasingly urgent, particularly in rapidly developing regions. This study introduces an advanced methodology for constructing regional-scale gridded anthropogenic CO2 emission inventories, integrating the latest energy consumption data and remote sensing technologies. By systematically calculating emissions across various sectors and energy types, and utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS) for spatial distribution, we have generated a high-resolution emission map with a 1 km × 1 km grid. The accuracy of the map was validated through regression analysis with the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) dataset, ensuring its reliability. This work provides critical insights for targeted emission reduction strategies, contributing to the formulation of sustainable development policies that align with global climate objectives.

These transitions can be technologically significant. For example, the classes of materials used in photovoltaics, or the use of fuel cells versus batteries in vehicle electrification. These transitions can also be more subtle and highlight shifts in perspectives the field is bringing toward research problems.I joined ACS Energy Letters as an editor in 2018, and in the past few years I started to notice a change in the focus of papers submitted to and published by the journal in the area of CO2 electroreduction. While there is not agreement on whether CO2 electroreduction will be broadly deployed, there has been consistent interest from the field of energy researchers. The shift I noticed is not from one chemistry to another (although the specific products of interest have evolved) but a switch in the perspective of researchers.To look into this shift in perspective, I searched all papers published by ACS Energy Letters since 2018 with the keyword "CO2 reduction" and focused on papers examining electrochemical reactions, processes, and systems. I categorized the papers as focusing on one of the following aspects of CO2 electroreduction technology:1.Catalyst: At the active site, often presenting new catalyst materials, new synthetic methods for catalysts, characterization of the active site, surface reaction mechanisms, etc.2.Environment: The environment where the chemistry occurs, discussing the role of pH, electrolyte, additive layers, flow rates, temperatures, chemical potentials, etc.3.Process: A process systems perspective focusing on how to assemble electrochemical reactors, flow patterns, bulk resistance losses, scale up viability, overall performance, etc.These classifications fall in the areas of catalyst, reaction, and process or systems science and engineering that are common to the scale up of chemical conversion processes.The compiled group of 167 papers results from the publication of ∼20–30 papers per year in ACS Energy Letters over 7 years, demonstrating consistent interest in the field (see Supporting Information). After categorizing the papers, the shift in perspective I sensed became clear, as seen in Figure 1. From 2018 to 2024, the number of papers focused on studies of the catalyst in CO2 electroreduction decreased from 18 to 4, or from 75% to 18% of the total papers published on the topic. Alternatively, the number of papers focused on the environment where the chemistry occurs increased from 2 to 9, or from 8 to 40% of the papers. The data in Figure 1 suggests that this change in topical focus occurred steadily over the past 6 years. Papers focused on the CO2 electroreduction process have remain consistent.Figure 1Figure 1. % of published papers on CO2 electroreduction published in ACS Energy Letters categorized based on their topical focus: Process, Catalyst, Environment, or Mixed (see text for explanations) since 2018. The papers were identified by searching all papers published in ACS Energy Letters for "CO2 reduction" and only categorizing those that focus on electroreduction.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe shift in perspective of researchers on CO2 electroreduction from the active catalyst site to the environment where the reaction occurs is apparent from the data. It is interesting to consider what may have driven this change. The U.S. Department of Energy published a document in 2017 that summarized Basic Research Needs in Catalysis Science and highlighted the role of catalyst design "beyond the binding site"─this seems consistent? (1) It is also reasonable to consider that early discoveries of electrocatalysts that enabled high selectivity for specific products at low current densities motivated studies at higher current densities where mass, heat, and electron transport can dictate performance. Clearly, this would also shift the focus of researchers to the environment around the binding site. Perhaps this trend is just the natural development of new energy technologies where a physical/chemical process is envisioned, initial material discovery is performed, and then analysis of increasing system time and length scales is performed in attempts to scale up. But it is interesting to wonder if the focus on active site design will push the field forward further than the design of the environment around the site.So, what did I learn from this retrospective analysis? My editorial is not meant to comment on the potential viability of CO2 electroreduction, but instead to try to learn from how an intensely studied research topic evolves. The results seem to suggest that researchers who can think broadly about a topic area, who do not follow the common approach of the field and instead focus efforts from a different perspective, may end up having the longest lasting impact on the field. However, this can be hard as funding agencies, journals and referees may not recognize a new perspective as useful if it is not the current norm. But it seems that research papers that bring new viewpoints to problems of broad interest are likely to be the most impactful and have the potential to shift the perspective of the field.Supporting InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.4c02907.Focus on electroreduction of CO2 (and CO), excluding photo- and thermochemical approaches – original articles and perspectives (XLSX)nz4c02907_si_001.xlsx (27.17 kb) Terms & Conditions Most electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

The swift expansion of the global population and economy has spurred growing requirements for energy and water in recent decades. Inefficient energy and water consumption, however, has led to an increase in CO2 emissions. Hence, the socio-economic development of a country must consider the interconnections between energy, water and carbon, as there are mutual dependencies among these three elements. This work considers the nexus between energy, water and carbon in the design of integrated energy–water systems using a new automated targeting modeling (ATM) framework. ATM incorporates the advantages of the insight-based Pinch method and a mathematical programming approach to provide visual understanding for a thorough analysis of the problem while guaranteeing accurate solutions. Minimum targets of power and water based on the integrated network operation were established by the ATM, with corresponding carbon emissions. A specific goal of annual carbon emissions reduction was set as the constraint and the ATM optimized the capacities of the components in the system accordingly to achieve minimum overall cost. The application of ATM on an industrial plant case study shows that a target of 45% reduction in the carbon discharge amount was achieved by shifting to greener fuel in the energy system at a minimum overall cost increase of 0.45% only. The framework can assist users in meeting power and water loads in their plant while planning for the appropriate decarbonization efforts at the minimum possible cost.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to play a significant role in the future development of smart cities, which are designed to be environmentally friendly. However, the proliferation of these devices, along with their frequent replacements and the energy required to power them, contributes to a significant environmental footprint. In this paper we provide scientific evidences on the advantages of using an energy design pattern named ‘Batch Operations’ (BO) to optimize energy consumption on mobile devices. Big ICT companies like Google already batch multiple API calls instead of putting the device into an active state many times. This is supposed to save tail energy consumption in communication peripherals. To confirm this, we set up an experiment where we compare energy consumption and carbon emission when BO is applied to two communication peripherals on Android mobile device: 4G and GPS. Results show that (1) BO can save up to 40% energy when sending HTTP requests, resulting in an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions. (2) no advantages for the GPS interface.

Abstract Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric half-life (~8.4 years) and a high short-term impact on global warming which is significantly higher than that of CO2. Traditional metrics such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) obscure the short-term, negative climatic effects of methane, potentially leading to inadequate policy responses. This study examines the limitations of GWP100 in capturing the true climate impact of methane, explores alternative metrics, and discusses the implications of under-reporting methane emissions. We highlight the necessity of adopting a more immediate perspective on methane to accelerate climate emergency action, while noting the adverse effects of the rapid growth rate of methane emissions on reduction efforts. Additionally, we hope that during COP29, policymakers will adopt actions that pay appropriate attention to the short-term warming potential of methane to dramatically reduce emissions and address the immediate climate crisis.Summary Points for Policy Makers. 1.Increased emissions monitoring with timely reporting to support stringent policies; 2.Urgent development and implementation of policies committing to a planned phase-out of existing GHG emission sources, prioritized by the level of emissions, including existing and planned fossil fuel projects to be replaced by renewable energy sources; 3.Immediate methane emission reductions for both “reported” and “natural” sources with increased investment by government and private, and penalties for target failures; and4.Improved, expanded communication among researchers, the public, and policy-makers.

Iron-sulfur clusters are desirable targets for bioinspired synthesis due to their versatility in promoting a range of catalytic reactions (N2 reduction to NH3, CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons, and selective C–H functionalizations) and ability to serve as model systems for the systematic interrogation of structure and mechanism. However, a challenge in replicating the activity of clusters remains their instability outside of the protein scaffold. Previous efforts to mitigate this challenge include incorporation into polymeric and aerogel networks and artificial metalloenzymes or installation of bulky, strong-field ligands, but none of these retain both the native weak-field primary ligand sphere and capacity for molecular-level tuning of the cofactor and second coordination sphere. Herein, we present a new strategy for stabilizing weak-field synthetic clusters and conferring second coordination sphere functionality via encapsulation inside molecular cages. Thus, clusters [Fe4S4(SR)4]2– ([1a-c]2–: R = Ph, CH2CH2OH, tBu) are encapsulated inside tetrahedral naphthalene diimide (NDI)-functionalized cages [M4L6]8+ (M = Fe, Ni, Zn) via a robust and generalizable electrostatic binding strategy. 1H and DOSY NMR, ESI-MS, and 57Fe Mössbauer studies confirm immediate and quantitative binding and suggest the cluster electronic structure is minimally perturbed by the cage. At the same time, the cage’s redox-switching ability is demonstrated in CV and 57Fe Mössbauer studies demonstrating that NDI reduction renders the encapsulated cofactors [1a-b]2– significantly more reducing, consistent with their effective charge donation to the cofactor via pi-pi stacking and H-bonding interactions. Importantly, cofactor reactivity is maintained as demonstrated in diphenylacetylene reduction trials, showing that the encapsulated clusters are not only structural but also functional cofactor models. Combined, these results demonstrate that molecular cages can function as protein-like encapsulants to site isolate, tune, and deliver substrate to functional weak-field models of bioinorganic cofactors, and support the use of molecular host-guest complexes as functional enzyme mimics for both catalytic and structure-function studies.

This study investigates the reduction in thermal residual stress during the powder bed fusion (PBF) process in a non-standardized shape generated by topology optimization method in lightweight automotive part of brake caliper. While the caliper of the braking system for reducing the CO2 consumption in vehicle systems undergoes a redesign to increased strength and reduced weight, challenges arise due to biased melting area ratios in the topologically optimized design, causing the thermal deformation. To address this, our research proposes an efficient PBF scan strategy aimed at minimizing anisotropy and residual stress—a critical consideration for successful manufacturing. The effectiveness of the laser scan strategy is validated through testing on a brake dynamometer, following the JASO C406 test procedure, an authorized standard for commercial brake calipers. Furthermore, a comparative analysis between the conventional product and the proposed brake caliper highlights superior performance, particularly under lightweight conditions. This comprehensive approach contributes valuable insights to the field, offering a potential solution for overcoming manufacturing challenges associated with topologically optimized designs in automotive components.

Chemical looping combustion (CLC) emerges as a cost-effective CO2 capture technology, demonstrating high competitiveness for both industrial and energy applications. This study explores the synthesis of a Cu-based, praseodymium (Pr)-modified gamma-alumina-supported (20CuPA) oxygen carrier (OC) through the wet impregnation method and investigates its performance in CLC. The characteristics of the synthesized OC were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The CLC of methane gas was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA-Q50). The oxygen transport capacity (OTC) of the 20CuPA-based OC was investigated for 10 redox cycles. The impact of temperature and time as process variables in determining the OTC of OCs was studied. The TGA results indicated that the most important factor influencing the optimization of the OTC of OCs was time. In comparison to time, temperature had less of an impact on the OTC of 20CuPA-OC. The maximum OTC of 20CuPA-OC, which was 0.0546 mg of O2/mg of OC, was reached using optimized process variables, including a temperature of 800 °C and a time of 3 min.

Electric mobility is a global trend and necessity, with electric and solar boats offering a promising alternative for transportation electrification and carbon emission reduction, especially in the Amazon region. This study analyzes the system of a solar boat from an electric mobility project—to be implemented at Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA)—using MATLAB software for modeling. The Simulink tool was utilized to model the system, focusing on operational parameters such as module voltage, converter voltage, and speed. The results indicate that the solar boat’s operational cost is significantly lower compared to a similar internal combustion model, considering diesel’s high consumption and cost. The environmental impact is also reduced, with nearly 72 tons of CO2 emissions avoided annually, thanks to Brazil’s renewable energy matrix. Simulations confirmed the project’s parameters, demonstrating the efficiency of digital-twin technology in monitoring and predicting system performance. The study underscores the importance of digital twins and renewable energy in promoting sustainable transportation solutions, advocating for the replication of such projects globally. Future research should focus on further advancing digital-twin applications in electric mobility to enhance predictive maintenance and operational efficiency.

This article presents a comparative assessment of energy consumption and fume emissions such as NOx, CO2, and CO associated with the excavation of a specified gypsum volume using two mining methods (blasting and mechanical extraction). The analysis was carried out based on a case study gypsum open-pit mine in Poland where both extraction methods are applied. The findings indicate that, for the same output volume, blasting operations require significantly less energy (ranging from 1298.12 MJ to 1462.22 MJ) compared to mechanical excavation (86,654.15 MJ). Furthermore, a substantial portion of the energy in blasting operations is attributed to explosive loading and drilling (970.95 MJ). Conversely, mechanical mining results in higher fume emissions compared to blasting. However, during mechanical extraction, the fumes are dispersed over a prolonged period of 275 h, whereas blasting achieves the same gypsum volume extraction in approximately 7.5 h. The prediction model suggests that, based on the obtained data, overall gypsum extraction will decline unless new operational levels are developed or the mine is expanded. This reduction in gypsum extraction will be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in energy consumption and emission of fumes.

Coal-fired power plants are a main source of energy in Poland. In the rapidly growing demand for the reduction of CO2 emission in the energy industry, the use of biomass for energy purposes has increased significantly. The combustion of biomass results in the generation of fly ash, with higher levels of CaO, K2O, P2O5, in contrast to the fly ash derived from the combustion of coal. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of phosphate compounds on fly ash-based geopolymer mortars. Geopolymers were made by mixing two types of fly ash—one from the combustion of wood biomass and the second from the combustion of coal in a heat and power station. Basic activators (NaOH and Na2SiO3) were used for the alkali activation. The maximum level of tetraphosphorus decaoxide addition was established at 5% of the total mass of the aluminosilicate precursors mass. The results showed that the phosphate oxide concentration within the specimens demonstrated a positive correlation with flexural and compressive strength across all temporal intervals (7, 28, and 56 days). The porosity, however, for samples with a 5% addition of P4O10, increased more than twofold in comparison to reference samples (from 4.26% to 9.98%).

This paper explores the development of positive energy communities using Eordaia, Greece, as a case study. The approach combines building and district-level energy analysis to achieve nearly zero energy performance through retrofitting, district-level storage systems, and renewable energy technologies. A parametric analysis utilizing RETSCREEN Expert and EnergyPlan software determines the optimal mix of technologies based on technical and financial parameters, with Eordaia, a region in energy transition and part of the RESPONSE Horizon project, illustrating the practical benefits. It includes a neighborhood of 105 mixed-use properties and two municipal buildings where a range of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures are applied. Insulation, photovoltaic systems, LED lighting, predictive thermostats, and windows coated with nanotechnology are some of the key interventions considered. The findings show considerable reductions in CO2 emissions and energy use, with payback periods ranging from 8.7 to 9.6 years. This study underscores the value of district-level strategies over individual building retrofits, highlighting cost savings and improved energy performance. These findings offer valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers aiming to transform urban areas into sustainable, positive energy districts, supporting the EU’s 2050 net-zero emissions goals.

Abstract Knowing the effect of different load distributions on the optimized sizes of the hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) and the fixed price of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station can be useful to potential investors in this sector. Additionally, the amount of CO2 emission under different load demands can help decision-makers in the installation of environmentally friendly EV charging stations. Investigation of fixed prices of installing power stations under different load demands leads to know whether electricity sell prices, and serves by the station owners are economically or not. This would also lead to give a reliable and economical plan to customers by station owners, where both time of arrival and charging prices have a pivotal role. Unlike previous similar studies that mostly consider one type of load demand, this study investigates the optimized HRESs including Photovoltaic panel (PV), Wind Turbine (WT), Diesel Generator (DG), and Battery (Bat) under five different proposed load demands (as electricity serving plans), reaching to the best economic, environmental, and space optimality systems. Three main sensitivity analyses upon the capacity shortage/inflation rate, capital cost of PV/WT, and solar global horizontal irradiation (GHI)/wind speed show the effect of changing the mentioned parameters on the economic, environment, and optimized systems’ sizes. It is observed that increase in the solar radiation and/or wind speed leads to reduction in the optimal size of designed systems.

ABSTRACT The production–consumption cycle needs a transition towards a circular economy where waste valorization is included. This study investigated briquetting as a stabilization method for black soldier fly frass (BSFF) with faecal matter, pig manure, and poultry manure as the larvae feed. Herein, dried BSFF was pyrolyzed at 350 °C for 2 h to produce biochar then mixed with charcoal dust in equal ratio to produce biobriquettes through densification, with cassava gel (10 wt%) as binder. One-way ANOVA showed statistical significance in carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. There were significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between the calorific value, moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, and fixed carbon of the briquettes. The fixed carbon, volatile matter, moisture, and ash content ranged from 29.66 ± 0.86 to 42.01 ± 0.92, 29.26 ± 0.52 to 32.59 ± 0.80, 2.95 ± 0.1 to 5.08 ± 0.04, and 21.48 ± 0.14 to 37.20 ± 0.29, respectively. The calorific value of the produced briquettes ranged from 16.25 ± 0.57 to 20.70 ± 0.53 MJ/kg, which exceeds the minimum requirement of 14.5 MJ/kg recommended for non-woody briquettes. During combustion, concentrations of NOx, N2O, CO, and CO2 varied significantly across the treatments with the acacia charcoal having the highest concentration of CO. Briquetting is a potential stabilization method for frass resulting in waste reduction, bioenergy production, reduced adverse effects of climate change, and enhanced sustainability.

In recent research on building materials, researchers have increasingly focused on replacing cement with agricultural waste. This approach offers significant advantages in terms of reducing global CO2 emissions and promoting the sustainability of building materials. In this paper, the use of the agricultural waste walnut shell ash (WSA) to partially replace cement in sustainable green mortars is explored. Specifically, equal amounts of WSA (5%, 10% and 15%) were used to replace cement. To offset the reduction in strength caused by the partial replacement of cement with WSA, basalt fibers were added to the mortar mixture. The effect of these fibers on the mechanical properties of the WSA-reinforced mortar was examined in compression tests, split tensile tests, and flexural fatigue cycle tests. In the flexural fatigue tests, the parameter and length of basalt fibers were varied and different stress levels (0.85, 0.8 and 0.75) were applied. The fatigue equations were developed using the Weibull model and p–s–n curves with a survival probability of 0.5 were derived. The results showed that the compressive strength and split tensile strength of the specimens increased with the addition of basalt fibers, with maximum values of 34.7 MPa and 3.8 MPa, respectively, and maximum increases of 8.78% and 21.95%, respectively. In addition, the average fatigue life of WSA mortar was 247,541 cycles, which increased by 139.26% when the stress level was 0.75, fiber length was 9 mm, and dosage was 0.3%. The linear regression fitting showed good correlation and provided valuable insights for practical engineering applications.

(1−3) Professor Haoshen Zhou from Nanjing University, China, has been selected as the 2024 PIER in the field of batteries and energy storage for his outstanding contribution to the area of high energy density secondary battery materials and systems. (4) We are honored to have the opportunity to celebrate his outstanding contributions in this special issue (SI).Professor Haoshen Zhou received his bachelor's degree in semiconductor physics from the Department of Physics at Nanjing University in 1985, master's degree in 1988 from the Nanjing Institute of Electronic Devices, and Ph.D. in chemical engineering in the School of Engineering at The University of Tokyo, Japan, in 1994. After his Ph.D. study, he pursued a further 3 years of postdoctoral training at RIKEN in Japan. In 1997, Professor Haoshen Zhou joined the Energy Interface Department of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, to pursue energy-related scientific research. He was promoted to a professor-level senior researcher in 2004 and became the chief senior researcher in AIST's Energy Department in 2011. During his tenure in Japan, Professor Zhou led numerous projects funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and the Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO). In 2012, he joined Nanjing University's College of Engineering and Applied Sciences as a full professor. Professor Zhou established the Department of Energy Science and Engineering and Center of Energy Storage Materials & Technology, where he served as their inaugural chairs. He was also appointed as a Yangtse Distinguished Professor by the Chinese Ministry of Education (2010). He held concurrent appointments as a special professor at The University of Tokyo and University of Tsukuba in Japan. Professor Zhou has served as an associate editor of Science Bulletin and Energy Storage Materials as well as an expert in charge of the National Key R&D Program's "Smart Grid Key Project" in China. During 2014–2018, he was the chief scientist for China's National Key Research Program in Nanotechnology. Professor Zhou received the "Lihua Yi" Chemical Innovation Award from the Chinese Chemical Society (2023) and the First Prize from the Chinese Materials Research Society (2024). Over his career, Professor Zhou has mentored more than 80 postdoctoral fellows and doctoral students, of which many have grown into emerging leaders in their respective research areas.Professor Haoshen Zhou has long been dedicated to the innovation and engineering of new high-energy-density battery systems and key materials. He established the reaction theory for high-capacity air electrodes, invented solid-state batteries based on sieving electrolytes, and developed and expanded the combined electrolyte battery system. As a corresponding author, he has published over 500 research papers and is a holder of over 80 authorized patents. Professor Zhou is a pioneer in the field of lithium–oxygen batteries, proposed a comprehensive mechanism for oxygen anion redox energy storage, and designed new high-energy-density lithium batteries. (5−9) Zhou and his team creatively introduced the "Li2O–Li2O2" oxygen anion redox process for charge storage, offering advantages such as high coulombic efficiency, good reversibility, and mild stability for the battery system. (6) He also discovered the critical role of trace amounts of H2O in enhancing the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) processes in organic electrolytes, proposing a synergistic catalytic mechanism between H2O molecules and Ru/SP/MnO2 cathodes, leading to breakthrough in lithium–air batteries. (7) Building upon the oxygen anion redox energy storage mechanism, he designed various highly efficient catalysts (e.g., Ir and Ni) to expand the reversible capacity of the cathode and suppress oxygen evolution. (6,8) Professor Zhou also proposed a concentrated dual-salt LiFSI–LiNO3/DOL electrolyte to improve the high-rate performance of lithium metal anodes, delivering stable operation for 240 cycles at 8.0 mA cm–2 and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.14%. (9) He also invented a closed lithium–oxygen battery with a lithium metal anode and high-capacity Li2O cathode, achieving a practical specific energy of 513 Wh kg–1 and a charge–discharge cycle life exceeding 200 cycles. (8) Professor Zhou summarized the essential criteria for redox mediators (RMs) to function as catalysts in lithium–air batteries and revealed the catalytic mechanism of these soluble catalysts during the charging process: (1) 2RM– + 2e– = 2RM+ and (2) 2RM+ + Li2O2 = 2Li+ + O2 + 2RM. (10) This theory led to his pioneering use of trichloroethyl chloroformate (TCCF) as a soluble catalyst for not only significantly reducing the overpotential of the OER but also greatly enhancing the reaction rate of the oxygen electrode. (11) The innovation improved the rate performance of lithium–oxygen batteries by over 10 times, with the cathode achieving a discharge specific capacity of 2005 mAh g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1.Professor Haoshen Zhou has also made groundbreaking contributions to the study of lithium–carbon dioxide (Li–CO2) batteries, high-energy-density batteries without lithium anodes, and development of new battery systems. He introduced in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to the study of CO2 electrode reactions, proposing the reaction mechanism for the reversible reduction and evolution of CO2 at the air electrode interface: 3CO2 + 4e– + 4Li+ = 2Li2CO3 + C. (12) He further introduced molten salt electrolytes, which verified the reversible reaction pathway of CO2 at the air electrode, reduced the electrode overpotential, and significantly improved the energy storage efficiency of the battery. (13) Professor Zhou and his team were the first to propose a lithium supplementation mechanism based on the OER of Li2O, successfully addressing the issue of capacity degradation caused by lithium loss during charge and discharge cycles. (14) A prototype anode-free lithium-ion battery with a layered transition metal oxide cathode was designed and operated, achieving a specific energy of 320 Wh kg–1 and a cycle life of 300 cycles. Professor Zhou also creatively introduced the concept of a combined electrolyte, constructed from "organic electrolytes", "lithium-ion solid electrolytes", and "aqueous electrolytes", integrating the characteristics of two or more electrolytes to design multiple energy conversion systems, leading to the invention of a high-capacity lithium–air battery and a technology for directly extracting elemental lithium from seawater. (15) The pioneering concept of combined electrolytes further led to the demonstration of an electrolytic cell system that has achieved both lithium extraction from seawater (or brine) and conversion of electrical energy into the chemical energy of lithium as a new energy storage solution. (16)Professor Zhou and his team further expanded the concept of combined electrolytes to integrate molecular sieves or framework compounds with organic electrolytes for successfully mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions on the anode surface, enhancing the stability of high-capacity lithium secondary batteries at high voltages (greater than 5.2 V versus Li/Li+) and elevated temperatures (100 °C). (17) This achievement is significant for expanding the application scenarios of electrolytes in high-output voltage systems and improving the energy density of various battery configurations. Professor Zhou then introduced the Cu3(BTC)2 metal–organic framework (MOF) as a selective electrolyte in lithium–sulfur battery systems for effectively preventing polysulfide ions from shuttling to the lithium metal side, significantly reducing capacity loss with an average capacity decay of only 0.019% over 1500 cycles. (18) He also invented a polypropylene ultrathin membrane modified with MOFs that greatly enhances the cycle life of lithium metal battery systems while increasing energy density, achieving a specific energy of 354 Wh kg–1 and 80% retention of its initial capacity after 200 cycles.

(26) It is a huge challenge to overcome the dissolution problem for cathode materials, especially for small-molecule organic cathode materials (SMOCMs). Song et al. investigated a commercially available vat dye, namely, flavanthrone, directly as a novel SMOCM for rechargeable lithium batteries. It possesses a low solubility benefiting from the extensive aromatic system and a high theoretical capacity based on the four electroactive C═O/C═N groups.

(29) Bai et al. demonstrated an in situ self-assembly strategy where metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) grew on a polypropylene separator. This MOF-based separator achieves permselective ion transport and regulation behavior, which effectively suppresses the nucleation and growth of Li dendrites. (30)Sodium-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 7 papers (3 reviews and 4 articles) are on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). SIBs have great potential for large-scale energy storage devices due to the high abundance, wide distribution, and non-toxicity of the resource. Li et al. reviewed the phase transition in layered oxide cathodes, pointing out the intrinsic causes and degradation mechanisms of phase transition for SIBs. They summarize the mainstream strategies to inhibit the phase transition, such as elemental doping, surface coating, and structural modification as well as the novel strategy of introducing anionic redox, providing new comprehension in understanding the phase transition of layered oxides. (31) Wang et al. presented a thorough discussion of the current research progress on layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) beginning with an explanation of the structure characteristics of P- and O-phase cathode materials.

(37)Zinc-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 3 papers (1 review and 2 articles) are on zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). ZIBs are viewed as promising grid-level energy storage solutions due to their high theoretical specific capacity (820 Ah kg–1 and 5855 Ah L–1), low electrochemical potential, ample geological resources, and compatibility with water. Zhang et al. comprehensively overviewed the functional role of the electrolyte additive in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs), including regulating the solvation structure, altering the H-bond network, forming an adsorption layer, generating an electrostatic shielding effect, and constructing a solid electrolyte interphase. The development prospects and existing problems of additives are also presented. (38) Wang et al. introduced certain MnSO4 into the ZnSO4 + K2SO4 hybrid electrolyte (Zn0.5K0.25) to improve the AZIBs.

The purification and removal of polar impurities in olefin feedstocks is crucial for downstream deep processing, and adsorption is the main method for deep purification of such impurities. This article takes dimethyl ether, a typical oxygen-containing compound impurity in MTOs, as a polar impurity molecule, and LTA and FAU topological zeolites as research objects. The influence of zeolite topology, morphology, skeleton silicon–aluminum (Si/Al) ratio, and ion type on the adsorption and removal of trace dimethyl ether was investigated by XRD, SEM, XRF, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption methods. The FAU topological zeolites show a better adsorption performance for dimethyl ether owing to their larger specific surface area and unobstructed pores compared with LTA zeolites. Among FAU topological zeolites, the NaX zeolite a with lower framework silica–alumina ratio has the highest adsorption capacity for dimethyl ether. Magnesium ion exchange on NaX zeolites (MgNaX) reduce the specific surface area and adsorption capacity of the NaX zeolite. However, after forming with alumina as a binder, the adsorption capacity of the MgNaX–Al2O3 adsorbent is about 13% higher than that of the NaX–Al2O3 adsorbent without Mg ion exchange. This may be due to the decomposition of residual organic Mg salts in the Mg ion exchange samples during high-temperature calcination, resulting in a larger specific surface area for the formed adsorbent. Further characterization of NH3–TPD and CO2–TPD shows that Mg ion exchange weakens the acid–base active sites on the adsorbent surface. The reduction in acid–base sites reduces the occurrence of side reactions such as polymerization and isomerization caused by the exothermic adsorption of olefins on adsorbents. Repeated adsorption data show that the formed adsorbent has excellent regeneration–adsorption performance.

Abstract Introduction An NHS community trust was commissioned in February 2023 to deliver a MOCH service to about 15,000 care home residents across an Integrated Care System (ICS). Pharmacists in the MOCH service undertake Structured Medication Reviews (SMRs) to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy, working closely with care homes, General Practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacies. Pharmacy technicians undertake medication reviews to reduce low clinical value medicines. A patient-centred approach means medicines are stopped or changed following shared-decision making with the resident, carer or family. Aim To find out the impact of the MOCH service on reducing inappropriate polypharmacy, reducing medicines-related harm for residents, and to report financial savings and the environmental impact through reduction of CO2 emissions. Methods This service evaluation was approved by the Trust. No ethics approval was required. Quarterly and 6- monthly data sets covering one week reported by the MOCH service in the financial year 2023/2024 were used. These data sets were extrapolated to a full year. This service reported the number of medicines stopped, started and changed over one week of each quarter for SMRs and, pharmacy technicians reported every six months. Cost savings were calculated using the drug tariff based on continued use of medicines for one year. Pharmacists reported reduction in harm from medicines every six months based on a health interventions risk assessment scoring tool, assessing how many residents had potentially avoided moderate to serious harm following a SMR. The carbon savings were calculated based on financial savings from medicines stopped or changed using the DEFRA SIC 2020 Greenhouse Gases emission factor 0.621(kgCO2e/£) for pharmaceuticals1. Results In the first year the MOCH service completed SMRs for 11,363 residents (75% of care home residents in the ICS). Around 20,000 medicines for residents were stopped (one to two medicines per resident). Pharmacists predicted moderate to high-risk harm from medicines was reduced in approximately 4,200 residents. The cost savings from medicines stopped or changed was approximately £2.8 million, which translated to carbon savings of 1,773,340 kgCO2e, the equivalent of removing 644 cars from the road for one year. Discussion and Conclusion Reducing inappropriate polypharmacy resulted in a reduction of treatment burden, potential harm to residents2 and financial savings. Social impacts include reducing workload for care homes, GPs and community pharmacies, ultimately increasing the capacity of this stretched workforce (less dispensing, reduced risk of error, shorter medicine rounds and more time for residents). The environmental impact goes beyond carbon savings from pharmaceuticals to include reduction in workload, consumables, delivery and cost of waste disposal and prevention of hospital admissions.3 The limitations of this evaluation are that data collected over one week and then extrapolated may not be representative of all the other weeks in terms of cost savings and reduction of harm to residents, however MOCH pharmacists undertake peer reviews of reduction in harms to mitigate this. Costs incurred in making the financial savings were excluded. As the demographic of older people rises in the next 20 years a medication review is increasingly important to residents, the health economy, workforce, and our environment. References 1.

IntroductionModern acid-producing diets in patients with stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) can cause severe acid accumulation with metabolic acidosis and less severe accumulation causing eubicarbonatemic acidosis in stages G2-G3, each with kidney injury. The impact of these diets on acid accumulation in those with CKD but normal eGFR (G1) is unclear.MethodsWe assessed whether acid accumulation occurs in patients with CKD and normal eGFR, and if added base-producing fruits and vegetables (F&V) or oral NaHCO3 (HCO3-) reduces acid accumulation and/or lowers kidney injury. We randomized 153 macroalbuminuric, non-diabetic, G1 (mean eGFR = 101 ml/min/1.73 m2) participants with hypertension-associated CKD to receive F&Vs in amounts to reduce dietary acid intake 50% (F&V, n=51), oral NaHCO3 to match alkali intake of F&V (HCO3-, n=51), or usual care (UC, n=51) for five years. We assessed acid accumulation by comparing observed to expected increase in plasma total CO2 in response to retained bicarbonate (dose minus urine bicarbonate excretion) two hours after an oral NaHCO3 bolus.ResultsBaseline acid accumulation, eGFR, urine excretion of albumin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, and angiotensinogen were not different among groups. Five-year acid accumulation [mean(SD)] was lower in F&V [-1.2 (11.0) mmoles] and HCO3- [-1.7 (10.8) mmoles] than UC [5.2 (10.3) mmoles, p<0.003)], consistent with lower acid accumulation in F&V and HCO3-. Five-year urine excretion of albumin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, and angiotensinogen were lower in F&V and HCO3- than UC, consistent with less kidney injury.ConclusionsDietary acid reduction reduces acid accumulation and kidney injury in patients with CKD and normal eGFR.

Abstract Members of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 states committed to achieving the emissions reductions outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, are considering policy options for inclusion of forest carbon in climate mitigation plans. These initiatives are generally limited by a lack of relevant data on forest carbon stocks and fluxes past-to-future. Previously, we developed a new forest carbon modeling system that combines high-resolution remote sensing, field data, and ecological modeling to estimate contemporary above-ground forest carbon stocks, and projected future forest carbon sequestration potential for the state of Maryland. Here we extended this work to provide a consistent geospatial approach for monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks over time. Utilizing the same data and modeling system developed previously for planning, we integrated historical input data on weather and disturbance to reconstruct the history of vegetation dynamics and forest above-ground carbon stocks annually over the period 1984-2016 at 30 m resolution and provided an extension to 2023. Statewide, forested land had an average annual net above ground carbon sink of 1.37 TgC yr-1, comparable to prior estimates. However, unlike the prior estimates, there was considerable variation around this mean. The statewide net above ground flux ranged interannually from -0.65 - 2.77 Tg C yr-1. At the county scale, the average annual net above ground flux ranged spatially from 0.01 - 0.13 Tg C yr-1 and spatiotemporally from -0.43 - 0.24 Tg C yr -1. Attribution analyses indicate the primary importance of persistent and regrowing forests, vegetation structure, local disturbance, and rising CO2 to the mean flux, and the primary importance of weather to the large-scale interannual variability. These results have important implications for state climate mitigation planning, reporting and assessment. With this approach, it is now possible to monitor changes in forest carbon stocks spatiotemporally over policy relevant domains with a consistent framework that is also enabled for future planning.

Background: Container terminal congestion is often measured by the average turnaround time for external trucks. Reducing the average turnaround time can be resolved by controlling the yard crane operation and the arrival times of external trucks (truck appointment system). Because the truck appointment system and yard crane scheduling problem are closely interconnected, this research investigates synchronization between the approaches used in truck appointment systems and yard crane scheduling strategies. Rubber-tired gantry (RTG) operators for yard crane scheduling operations strive to reduce RTG movement time as part of the container retrieval service. However, there is a conflict between individual agent goals. While seeking to minimize truck turnaround time, RTGs may travel long distances, ultimately slowing down the RTG service. Methods: We address a method that balances individual agent goals while also considering the collective objective, thereby minimizing turnaround time. An agent-based simulation is proposed to simulate scenarios for yard crane scheduling strategies and truck appointment system approaches, which are centralized and decentralized. This study explores the combined effects of different yard scheduling strategies and truck appointment procedures on performance indicators. Various configurations of the truck appointment system and yard scheduling strategies are modeled to investigate how those factors affect the average turnaround time, yard crane utilization, and CO2 emissions. Results: At all levels of truck arrival rates, the nearest-truck-first-served (NTFS) scenario tends to provide lower external truck turnaround times than the first-come-first-served (FCFS) and nearest-truck longest-waiting-time first-served (NLFS) scenario. Conclusions: The decentralized truck appointment system (DTAS) generally shows slightly higher efficiency in emission reduction compared with centralized truck appointment system (CTAS), especially at moderate to high truck arrival rates. The decentralized approach of the truck appointment system should be accompanied by the yard scheduling strategy to obtain better performance indicators.

To address the growing scarcity of freshwater resources, the use of saline water for agricultural irrigation is gaining increasing attention. This study presents findings from a two-year field experiment conducted during the 2023 and 2024 maize-growing seasons in northwestern China. The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the main and interactive effects of saline irrigation water on soil water–salt dynamics, maize growth, photosynthetic characteristics, water productivity, and carbon emissions. The experiment involved nine treatments with three irrigation amounts: 4500 m3 hm−2 (W1), 5625 m3 hm−2 (W2), and 6750 m3 hm−2 (W3), combined with three water salinity levels: 0.85 g L−1 (S1, freshwater), 3 g L−1 (S2), and 5 g L−1 (S3). Results indicated that both irrigation amount and salinity level significantly affected water–salt dynamics, with more soil accumulating in the 0–100 cm soil layer under saline irrigation water; however, this effect diminished with higher irrigation amounts. The maximum leaf area index and plant height were affected by both the irrigation amount and salinity level, as well as their interaction. Photosynthetic capacity declined with increasing salinity of the irrigation water, ultimately reducing grain yield and irrigation water use efficiency. Compared to freshwater (S1), the average maize grain yield under S2 and S3 treatments decreased by 6.28% and 15.43% in 2023 and by 7.82% and 17.48% in 2024, respectively. Additionally, for the same irrigation amount, higher salinity of the irrigation water (S2, S3) significantly reduced total soil CO2 emissions, with reductions of 10.08% and 27.53% in 2023, and 11.97% and 28.01% in 2024, respectively. In summary, to optimize the utilization of saline water, enhance maize yield, and improve soil carbon sequestration, we recommend maintaining the salinity of irrigation water below 3 g L−1, and using an irrigation amount of 6750 m3 hm−2 (W3S2) for optimal outcomes in the study area.

Abstract. The carbon cycle plays a foundational role in the estimation of the remaining carbon budget. It is intrinsic for the determination of the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions and the zero-emissions commitment. For the terrestrial carbon cycle, nutrient limitation is a core regulation on the amount of carbon fixed by terrestrial vegetation. Hence, the addition of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in land model structures in Earth system models is essential for an accurate representation of the carbon cycle feedback in future climate projections. Therefore, the estimation of the remaining carbon budget is impacted by the representation of nutrient limitation in modelled terrestrial ecosystems; however, it is rarely accounted for. Here, we estimate the carbon budget and remaining carbon budget of a nutrient-limited Earth system model, using nitrogen and phosphorus cycles to limit vegetation productivity and biomass. We use eight Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (hereafter SSP) scenarios and idealized experiments with three distinct model structures: (1) carbon cycle without nutrient limitation, (2) carbon cycle with terrestrial nitrogen limitation, and (3) carbon cycle with terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus limitation. To capture the uncertainty in the remaining carbon budget, three different climate sensitives were tuned for each model version. Our results show that, overall, nutrient limitation reduced the remaining carbon budget for all simulations in comparison with the carbon cycle without nutrient limitation. Between nitrogen and nitrogen–phosphorus limitation, the latter had the lowest remaining carbon budget. The mean remaining carbon budgets obtained from the SSP scenario simulations for the 1.5 °C target in the non-nutrient-limited, nitrogen-limited, and nitrogen–phosphorus-limited models were 228, 185, and 175 Pg C, respectively, relative to the year 2020. For the 2 °C target, the mean remaining carbon budget values were 471, 373, and 351 Pg C for the non-nutrient-limited, nitrogen-limited, and nitrogen–phosphorus-limited models, respectively, relative to the year 2020. This represents a reduction of 19 % and 24 % for the 1.5 °C target and 21 % and 26 % for the 2 °C target for the respective nitrogen- and nitrogen–phosphorus-limited simulations compared with the non-nutrient-limited model. These results show that terrestrial nutrient limitation constitutes an important factor to be considered when estimating or interpreting remaining carbon budgets and that it is an essential uncertainty in the remaining carbon budgets from Earth system model simulations.

Herbicides are chemicals used to manage unwanted plants (terrestrial or aquatic) called weeds.Over a long period, there has been a continuous effort to develop more selective herbicide compounds.However, the introduction of new herbicides with either a new mode of action or novel chemical classes has slowed in the last 30 years. For example, relatively few herbicides with new modes of action (MOAs) have been discovered in the past two decades (Qu, 2021). Farmers prefer chemical herbicides as they are the most effective and practical way to control weeds due to their high efficacy, specific mode of action, affordable cost, and better profitability (Abouziena et al., 2016). Herbicides can enter a plant through roots, shoots, stems, foliage, or buds. To be effective, contact herbicides must adequately contact plants, while plants must then absorb systemic herbicides, move within the plants to the site of action without being deactivated and reach the site of action at toxic levels. Herbicide selectivity is based on differential absorption, translocation, and metabolism of herbicides in plants.Overall, herbicide performance largely depends on its application rate, environmental impacts, and spray technology.In the wake of climate change, rising CO2 could alter yield losses due to competition from weeds, and weed control will be crucial in realizing any potential increase in the yield of C3 crops (Kaur et al., 2020). Climate variability also directly affects herbicide efficacy by altering the absorption and translocation of herbicides within the plant. Climate change leading to altered environmental conditions increases the risk for metabolism-based reduction in herbicide efficacy for weed control. distinct variation in efficacy of 2,4-D was found in Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. 33Watson) grown at high temperature low temperature enhanced 2,4-D metabolism at high 34 temperature resulted in reduced herbicide to control of the resistant A. palmeri population (Rudell et 35 al., 2023). Besides the physicochemical properties of herbicides, environmental factors such as 36 temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil physicochemical properties may significantly impact the 37 performance of herbicides. Knowledge of soil phase characteristics and the mechanisms involved in 38 herbicide transformation can help to understand the fate of herbicides in soil. Therefore, current 39Research Topic was initiated for this purpose and includes five research papers on application timing, 40 herbicide rotation, integrated use of herbicides with non-chemical measures and evaluation of herbicide 41 efficacy. 42 Annual/rigid ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) has evolved resistance to herbicides of multiple 43 modes of action groups in many parts of the world (Heap, 2024); probably the worst-case scenario is 44 evolved in many cropping regions in Australia. Dose-response studies are helpful in evaluating 45 herbicide efficacy for weed control, crop safety, putative herbicide resistance, and herbicide persistence 46 production. feasible integrated weed management systems, including herbicide 65 programs with herbicides and crop rotations, may be designed for diverse production situations 66 can reduce weed infestations and environmental impacts, and prolong the use of (Kaur 67 et al., 2023b). Another manuscript by Vulchi et al., (2023) corroborate the above statements. This 68 manuscript highlights that, when crop rotations were integrated with dicamba-based herbicide 69 programs and residual herbicides, it helped in effective management of Palmer amaranth across tillage 70 types and environments. 71In conclusion, this special Research Topic on Herbicide Efficacy explored the relevant aspects 72 for sustainable weed management with herbicides. Creating a novel herbicide is a significant challenge 73 for the industry; therefore, good stewardship practices must be maintained to increase the herbicide 74 life. The high costs, regulatory hurdles and eventual resistance make new discoveries daunting. 75Recently, herbicide-tolerant crops (and genetically modified organisms in general) are considered an 76 agro-business opportunity, potentially allowing the use of one and the same herbicide across many 77 crops. The increasing world population seems to be a major driver for the need to increase food 78 production output per area. The high impact of weed competition on yields makes weed control 79 mandatory. To secure crop yields, herbicides for weed management will continue to be the preferred 80 choice for the foreseeable future. However, herbicides should persist long enough to check weeds until 81 the end of the critical period of weed competition but should not persist beyond the crop harvest. 82 Moreover, the physicochemical properties of herbicides affect their behaviour in soil and regulate their 83 interaction mechanisms with organic and inorganic soil phases. Predicting herbicide movement and 84 fate in soils is an important strategy in limiting their environmental impact. The non-sustainable use of 85 pesticides, low efficacy, faster evolution of resistance in weeds, pollution and biomagnification of 86 pesticides in agroecosystems and food chains are questioning the success of chemical weed control. 87As one of the future trends, these adverse effects of herbicides would be addressed with the novel 88 developments in nanotechnology. However, the road to finally accepting nanoherbicides in current 89 cropping systems is not a short one; several obstacles need to be overcome including the regulating 90 framework for their approval. 91
