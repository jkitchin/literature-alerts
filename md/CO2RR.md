Abstract As an effective approach to converting carbon oxide (CO 2 ) into value‐added carbonaceous products, the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) has shown considerable potential for carbon neutrality, addressing global pollution and climate issues. Copper (Cu)‐based electrocatalysts (CuECs) are acknowledged as important candidates for the ECO 2 RR of multi‐carbon products. Nevertheless, the complicated electron transfer and multiple competitive pathways in the multi‐carbon production process raise challenges of product selectivity. While achieving high current density and structural stability, improving the product selectivity of CuECs has become crucial to their practical applications. Herein, an overview of the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic principles of ECO 2 RR are presented. Then, the typical strategies are summarized for increasing CuEC selectivity for the formation of multi‐carbon products from CO 2 , including morphological control, component design, defect design, and interface design. The catalyst design, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanisms involved in these strategies are reviewed. Finally, the major challenges and future prospects for high‐performance electrocatalysts in ECO 2 RR are discussed.

Compared with the large number of publications devoted to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysed by polyoxometalates (POMs), the electrocatalysis of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CDRR) by these molecular catalysts has been only marginally explored. At first glance, this may seem surprising in view of their remarkable electron transfer properties which can be finely tuned by molecular engineering to fit the different proton-assisted multielectron reduction potentials for CO 2 . The possible combination of CO 2 with POMs in the form of coordination complexes appears, however, to be a promising route to develop POM-based electrocatalytic assemblies able to selectively drive CDRR. In this chapter, we provide an up-to-date description of more or less promising examples dealing with CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs in homogeneous (POMs dissolved in the electrolyte solution) and supported (POMs-modified (photo)electrodes) phases. This shows that promoting CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs with excellent performance metrics (efficiency, selectivity and stability) represents a current challenge. As a representative example, a POM-modified electrode that delivers high electrocatalytic current density (>10 mA cm −2 ) and is highly selective for CDRR has yet to be discovered.

Given the increasing emphasis on carbon dioxide (CO2), diverse approaches have been developed and then used to address the issue. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown promise in catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Different types of MOFs have investigated, including Cu-MOFs, Ce-MOFs, and hybrid composites, in order to enhance the catalytic selectivity, activity, and stability of electrocatalysts. MOFs possess distinct structural characteristics such as a large surface area, adjustable pore architectures, and numerous active sites, which provide effective adsorption, activation, and subsequent electrochemical reduction of CO2. The inclusion of metal centres, such as copper, silver, and cobalt, in MOFs has shown a strong preference for valuable chemical products, such as ethylene, formate, methane, and acetic acid. Incorporating MOFs with carbon-based electrodes or photosensitizers has significantly improved the catalytic efficiency and the speed at which charge is transferred in CO2 electroreduction processes. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles to overcome, such as the need to optimize the composition of catalysts, manage particle size, and provide scalability for use in industrial applications. Further study is necessary to expand the range of electrochemical techniques and reaction conditions, enhance the longevity of catalysts, and explore the potential of utilizing these types of catalysts for the specific conversion of CO2 into other valuable liquid fuels.

Abstract This study builds upon the evolving landscape of sustainable construction practices, where optimizing ready-mix concrete for strength, cost-efficiency, and reduced CO2 emissions is crucial in aligning with global environmental sustainability targets. Through an extensive analysis of diverse input parameters, including water-cement ratio, aggregate characteristics, additives, and their interactions with critical output parameters, this research has unveiled a substantial dependence on concrete performance, cost-efficiency, and environmental impact on cement selection and proportioning. This research emphasizes the pivotal role of cement in determining both the cost and CO2 emissions of concrete production, highlighting a notable positive correlation between cement content and compressive strength (R2 = 0.4946), and an even more pronounced correlation with CO2 emissions (R2 = 0.9529). This underlines the importance of optimizing cement use for balanced performance. Furthermore, the study reveals that while admixtures play a limited role in enhancing compressive strength (R2 = 0.0426), their impact on other concrete properties like workability and durability is significant. The optimization of concrete components, including a strategic reduction in admixture use, can lead to considerable cost and CO2 emission reductions, exemplified by a 5% cost decrease and a 7% drop in emissions with a 20% admixture reduction. Overall, these findings highlight the transformative impact of AI in concrete mix design, paving the way for more sustainable construction methods and contributing to global efforts to reduce the infrastructure sector's carbon footprint.

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) capture, storage and its utilization can be used to decrease Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Hong 2022). Alteration of the wettability of oil reservoirs has the potential to improve the oil recovery (Sheng, 2010). Wettability is defined the tendency of a fluid to adhere to a solid surface in the presence of other immiscible fluids (Craig, 1971). In multiphase flow in oil reservoirs, wettability is important for phase distribution and flow properties. In fractured reservoirs, wettability alteration will improve the spontaneous imbibition of water and thereby improve the oil recovery (Sheng, 2010; Fjelde and Asen, 2009). In spontaneous imbibition experiments, carbonated water (CW, water saturated with CO2) at oil reservoir conditions has been found to improve the spontaneous imbibition of water in fractured chalk models and improve the oil production (Fjelde et al., 2011). Sandstone rocks can also contain carbonate minerals (e.g. Pan et al., 2016). In addition, clay minerals in sandstone rocks are often more oil-wet than the other non-carbonate minerals. The surface area of clay minerals can be high in sandstone rocks, and these surfaces are very important for the wettability on core scale and reservoir scale. The flow properties in oil reservoirs depends on the saturation functions (relative permeability and capillary pressure) (Dake, 1978). Mineral composition and mineral distribution will together with the fluid compositions and conditions (temperature, pressure) determine these functions. Alteration of wettability for non-fractured oil reservoirs to more water-wet has also the potential to accelerate the oil production due to improvement of the relative permeability of oil (Collins and Melrose, 1983; Clementz 1976; 1977; 1982; Lager et al., 2007). Alteration of the wettability to more water-wet may have the potential to reduce the mobility ratio and thereby improve the volumetric sweep of the reservoir. The water production will be less at more water-wet conditions, because the relative permeability of water is low and higher volumetric sweep efficiency will the delay the water breakthrough. Alteration of wettability to more water-wet will therefore reduce the water production. Increase in relative permeability for oil and decrease in the relative permeability for water will give a shorter production period. Shorter production period and less water production will also reduce the environmental impact. Surface Complexation Modeling (SCM) with the geochemistry solver, PHREEQC has been used to estimate the wettability preferences of the minerals and rocks (Mehdiyev et al. 2022). The wettability preferences were estimated by calculating Bond Products defined as the product of the mole fraction of oppositely charged oil and mineral surfaces. It was shown that the SCM technique can predict the tendency for wettability alteration of the individual minerals and reservoir rocks during injection of CW using the different rock, brine and Stock Tank Oil (STO) compositions.

Developing a function-integrated catalyst from earth-abundant elements, capable of efficient light harvesting and electron transfer, is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of CO2 transformation, a critical step in environmental cleanup and advancing clean energy prospects. Traditional approaches relying on external photosensitizers, comprising of 4d/5d metal complexes, often face challenges in intermolecular electron transfer, and attachment of photosensitizing arms to the catalyst increases dependency on intramolecular electron transfer kinetics, underscoring the need for a more integrated solution. We report a new Cu(II) complex, K[CuNDPA] (1[K(18-crown-6)]), bearing a dipyrrin amide-based trianionic tetradentate ligand, NDPA (H3L), which is capable of harnessing light energy, despite having a paramagnetic Cu(II) center, without any external photosensitizer and photocatalytically reducing CO2 to CO in acetonitrile: water (19:1 v/v) with a TON as high as 1132, a TOF of 566 h-1 and a selectivity of 99%. This complex also shows hemilability in the presence of water, which not only plays a role in a proton relay mechanism but also helps stabilize a crucial Cu(I)-NDPA intermediate. The hemilability was justified by the formation of N3O (2) and N2O2 (3) coordinated congeners of the N4 bound complex 1. The overall mechanism was further investigated via spectroscopic techniques like EPR, UV-vis, and Spectroelectrochemistry, culminating in the justification of a single electron-reduced Cu(I)NDPA species as a proposed intermediate. In the next step, the binding of CO2 to Cu(I) complex and subsequent electron transfer to form Cu(II)-CO2•‾ was indirectly probed by a radical trapping experiment via the addition of p-methoxy-2,6-ditertbutylphenol that led to the formation of a phenoxyl radical. This work opens new strategies for designing earth-abundant robust molecular catalysts that can function as photocatalysts without the aid of any external photosensitizers.

To mitigate global warming to the most ambitious targets, it is necessary to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and reduce fossil fuels use. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4) as a basic chemical is a promising technology that meets both requirements; however, its life cycle CO2 emissions remain inconclusive because of varying assumptions in the performance indices. This study aimed to set benchmarks for the four most sensitive indices to achieve -0.5 t-CO2/t-C2H4 by calculating net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a prospective life cycle assessment of a model system including CO2 capture, CO2 enrichment, electrochemical conversion, CO2 recycling, and cryogenic separation. As a result, the electrochemical conversion process was the hotspot of life cycle emissions, and representative benchmarks were determined as follows: cell voltage, 3.5 V; C2H4 Faraday efficiency, 70%; conversion rate, 20%; and electrochemical CO2 recycling energy, 2.2 GJ/t-CO2. The gaps between the benchmarks and current top data of cell voltage and Faraday efficiency were <10%, and suppressing the performance degradation for up to one year was found to be a critical requirement. These results can direct research towards the development of a year-round stable system, rather than further improving the performance indices.

Fine-tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure-property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed-dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal-on-nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self-assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a series of Au-on-Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au-on-Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface-dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.

Thermal motor emissions have grown cold and colder over time thanks to the betterment of the yield of motors. This contributes to an inversion of behaviour of CO2, since photosynthesis is endothermic, absorbs heat together with it. New CO2 emissions are coldening the climate where thermal motor efficiency is good. This is confirmed with AI support and shown to explain the late snows this Spring in Europe, as well as the “La Niña” trend that has been announced. Global warming can be totally reduced and reversed with a consistent pattern of smart CO2 emissions, without the heat associated, thanks to new thermally efficient motors.

Background: Ventilatory strategies in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients aim to mitigate the risk of acute lung injury (ALI). However, prolonged utilization of these strategies may precipitate alveolar carbon dioxide elevation and pH reduction. This scoping review endeavors to present extant knowledge concerning hypercapnia effects in experimental models, with or without ALI, specifically focusing on delineating the immunologically mediated pulmonary tissue damage; Methods: A systematic exploration encompassing PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Reviews, and Scielo databases was undertaken. Articles published between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2022, were screened for their elucidation of hypercapnia&#039;s immunological impact on lung tissue, utilizing experimental or biological models, irrespective of ALI presence; Results: Following duplicate removal and predefined criteria filtering, 30 pertinent articles scrutinizing hypercapnia&#039;s influence on pulmonary epithelium were identified. It was observed that hypercapnia induces perturbations in innate immune response gene transcription, mediated via Nuclear Factor-kappa B attenuation. Furthermore, a compromised innate immune response against injurious agents was noted. Concurrently, disruption and subsequent resealing of alveolar epithelial cells were evidenced, primarily through Na/K-ATPase endocytosis, impeding fluid reabsorption at the alveolar epithelium level; Conclusions: In experimental settings, with or without ALI, hypercapnia&#039;s immunomediated mechanisms exacerbate innate immune system impairment and disrupt the respiratory epithelium&#039;s repair and healing processes.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) provides the protons for many electrocatalytic power-to-X processes, such as the production of green hydrogen from water or methanol from CO2. Iridium oxo-hydroxides (IOHs) are outstanding catalysts for this reaction because they strike a unique balance between activity and stability in acidic electrolytes. Within IOHs, this balance varies with atomic structure. While amorphous IOHs perform best, they are least stable. The opposite is true for their crystalline counterparts. These rules-of-thumb are used to reduce the loading of scarce IOH catalysts and retain performance. However, it is not fully understood how activity and stability are related on the atomic level, hampering rational design. Herein, we provide simple design-rules (Figure 12) derived from literature and various IOHs within this study. We chose crystalline IrOOH nanosheets as our lead material because they provide excellent catalyst utilization and a predictable structure. We found that nanosheets combine the chemical stability of crystalline IOHs with the activity amorphous IOHs. Their dense bonding network of pyramidal trivalent oxygens (μ3∆–O) provides structural integrity, while allowing reversible reduction to an electronically gapped state that diminishes the destructive effect of reductive potentials. The reactivity originates from coordinative unsaturated edge sites with radical character, i.e. μ1–O oxyls. By comparing to other IOHs and literature, we generalized our findings and synthesized a set of simple rules that allow prediction of stability and reactivity of IOHs from atomistic models. We hope that these rules will inspire atomic design strategies for future OER catalysts.

In this work, we have prepared and characterized some gold compounds wearing a N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand as well as alkynyl derivatives with different substituents. The study of their electrochemical behavior reveals that these complexes show an irreversible wave at potentials ranging between −2.79 and −2.91 V, referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene pair. DFT calculations indicate that the reduction occurs mainly on the aryl-C≡C fragment. The cyclic voltammetry experiments under CO2 atmosphere show an increase in the faradaic current of the reduction wave compared to the experiments under argon atmosphere, indicating a possible catalytic activity towards the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR).

Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction. Herein, a unique Co‐N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2'‐bipyridine and triazine‐containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy‐COF‐Co enabled a record‐high CO production rate of 426 mmol g‐1 h‐1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607 h−1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8:1‐1:16). A systematical investigation including operando synchrotron X‐ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in‐situ attenuated total reflection surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine‐based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co‐N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF‐derived single‐atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.

The application of carbon dioxide (CO2) in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects is becoming increasingly more interesting in the petroleum industry because it can boost oil production rates while potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The injected CO2 causes oil swelling and viscosity reduction, making it easier to flow through the reservoir fractures. This article studies the performance of the first EOR CO2 project in Croatia, which started operations in 2014 with a capacity of 0.41 million tons per year (Mtpa). The CO2 source is a natural gas processing plant, which released the CO2 into the atmosphere prior to the EOR project. Now, this CO2 is continuously captured, compressed, transported, liquefied, and injected into the EOR fields of Ivanić and Žutica. Tertiary (EOR) oil recovery at these two oil fields is expected to raise the oil recovery factors up to 55% from the previously achieved 9% in the primary stage and 36% in the secondary stage. Besides the EOR project, this article reviews other carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects in Croatia, for the cement industry, power generation, and biofuel production. All these projects combined could bring the total CCUS capacity up to 1.843 Mtpa by 2030.

This paper aims to verify the possibility of utilising water-in-diesel emulsions (WiDE) as an alternative drop-in fuel for diesel engines. An 8% WiDE was produced to be tested in a four-stroke, indirect injection (IDI) diesel engine and compared to EN590 diesel fuel. An eddy current brake and an exhaust gas analyser were utilised to measure different engine parameters such as torque, fuel consumption, and emissions at different engine loads. The results show that the engine running on emulsified fuel leads to a reduction in torque and power, an increase in the specific fuel consumption, and slightly better thermal efficiency. The highest percentual increment of thermal efficiency for WiDE is obtained at 100% engine load, 5.68% higher compared to diesel. The emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are reduced, but carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) emissions are increased, compared to traditional diesel fuel. The most substantial decrease in NO and CO2 levels was achieved at 75% engine load with 33.86% and 25.08% respectively, compared to diesel.

The notable reduction in forest coverage and usage of nonrenewable energy resources have resulted in accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thus contributing to the worsening of the phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. This research undertook an investigation into the efficacy of a distinct absorbent in eliminating CO2 from the air within a spouted bed reactor. By utilizing the Taguchi methodology, the study examined the capacity of sodium carbonate to eradicate CO2 from the atmosphere across a wide range of concentrations (600–1850 ppm), temperatures (55–90 °C), and molar ratios of Na to C in the absorbent (ranging from 1 to 3). The results indicated that this absorbent effectively eliminated 86% of the initial CO2 at a reaction temperature of 55 °C, a molar Na/C ratio of 1.4, and an initial concentration of 1280 ppm. Additionally, the examination of the solid composition postabsorption using X-ray diffraction revealed the formation of sodium bicarbonate during the absorption process. The novelty of this study resides in the introduction of a novel method for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. Moreover, the viability of regenerating sodium carbonate by liberating CO2 from bicarbonate was also evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis.

The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is one of the most promising ways to valorise CO2 as a source of carbon. The development of novel, efficient and scalable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction within electrolysers is still a big challenge. Here, we report the preparation of sustainable, efficient and stable gas diffusion electrodes utilizing Ag as catalyst for the CO2 electroreduction to CO. These cathodic materials are prepared by sputter deposition and subjected to post-deposition modification using dry, reactive processes. The catalyst is uniformly deposited as a thin layer on the porous structure of PTFE minimizing the amount of Ag required. This approach allows for fine tuning of the morphology, chemical composition and loading of Ag and their impact on the CO2RR. These electrodes have been evaluated for the CO2 electroreduction and for electrocatalytic studies in a flow reactor with gas-fed CO2. The optimized electrodes show high activity, with current densities > 20 mA/cm2 at -1,18 V vs. RHE, and faradaic efficiency for CO > 90 %. The stability was tested over periods up to 24 hours showing a significant impact of the post-deposition modification. Higher porosity, roughness and electrochemical surface area have been achieved after the modification. Noteworthy, our approach allows for outstanding performances using a minimal amount of metal, while using the processing advantages of sputtering as an industrial state-of-the-art, high-throughput, and roll-to-roll compatible technique. Moreover, this route enables the deposition of different metals and alloys of tailored composition for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction beyond CO.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) over Cu-based catalysts has emerged as a promising strategy for value-added artificial carbon cycling, addressing the current climate and energy challenges. However, the product selectivity and long-term stability of Cu-based catalysts are limited by their instability at constant potential. Recent advancements in pulsed techniques aim to overcome these limitations, enhancing the industrial feasibility of the CO2RR systems. This review critically examines recent research progress in pulsed CO2RR over Cu-based catalysts, offering a comprehensive synthesis of current findings. Key pulse parameters and characterization strategies are explored to uncover the mechanisms behind the enhanced CO2RR performance. The focus is on surface reconstruction, encompassing the regeneration and stabilization of the Cu oxidation states alongside morphological evolution, while also discussing microenvironment changes, including local CO2 concentration, local pH, and ionic arrangement. The intricate modulation mechanisms of pulse mode, potential, and duration on the CO2RR performance are elucidated, highlighting their interconnections. Finally, we identify the prevailing challenges and propose future directions for achieving environmentally friendly and economically viable artificial carbon cycling. By providing insightful perspectives on optimizing pulsed CO2RR, this review paves the way for developing more efficient and robust Cu-based catalytic systems.

(1) Efforts on harnessing excess emitted CO2 back to the carbon cycle via chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical pathways have seen steady development to produce value-added chemicals for energy storage. (1,2) Among them, an environmentally benign electroreduction approach is the most promising one for valorization of CO2 as fuels and chemicals, albeit the fact that sluggish kinetics and lack of selectivity require the design of suitable catalysts. (3,4) Molecular electrocatalysts have well-defined active sites and accurately tailorable structures that allow mechanism-based performance optimization. Among them, several are based on easily available first-row transition metals to catalyze CO2 reduction (CO2RR) via a 2e–/2H+ mechanism to form CO and HCOOH. (5) Nevertheless, examples of molecular catalysts capable of reducing CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ (e.g., multielectron products) are scarce. A key reason for that is the difficulty in controlling the binding affinity of the catalyst-bound CO intermediate, which often plays a pivotal role in the generation of multielectron/multiproton products. (5,6) Along with this, the complexity of the multielectron/multiproton pathways involving multiple intermediates provides a limited understanding of the reaction mechanism. (5,7) Herein, we would like to highlight several recently reported strategies that show promising CO2RR activity and selectivity toward products beyond 2e–/2H+, such as (i) immobilization of functionalized molecular catalysts over conductive supports, (ii) incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding groups proximal to the active site, and (iii) the use of light illumination during electrochemical CO2RR in molecular catalysts incorporated within porous hybrid platforms.Initially, Wang et al. reported one of the first examples of a molecular electrocatalyst reducing CO2 to value-added multielectron hydrocarbons. They immobilized a cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst (CoPc, Figure 1a) over multiwalled carbon-nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNTs) and used it as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst that, in aqueous solution, undergoes 6e–/6H+ CO2RR to generate CH3OH. (5) They first compared the catalytic performance of CNT-immobilized iron, cobalt, and nickel phthalocyanine (FePc, CoPc, and NiPc, respectively), as metal-to-CO binding energy, EB(CO), varies with different M–N4, spanning over a range of 1.2 eV and found that cobalt provides moderate CO binding. Therefore, among all three catalysts, only CoPc produced MeOH with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 44% at −0.94 V vs RHE (CO and H2 being the major products for FePc and NiPc). Through scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis they have shown that CoPc has molecular level dispersion over the CNT, which is vital for MeOH formation. Otherwise, physical mixtures of CoPc and CNTs showed much less reactivity, despite having higher CoPc content. According to their observation, at lower overpotential, CO was the major CO2RR product, and thus, it was postulated that CO acts as a reactive intermediate toward MeOH formation. Indeed, when an electrocatalytic CO reduction reaction (CORR) using CoPc/MWCNT was performed, it produced MeOH with a FE of 28% at −0.77 V vs RHE. Overall, catalysis goes through a "domino" process where CO2 first reduces to CO, and then undergoes another 4e–/4H+ reduction to MeOH, and the potential-dependent steps of both CO2RR and CORR are very similar. Nonetheless, this catalytic system suffers from rather limited durability. Upon only 1 h of electrolysis, FECH3OH decreased by 18%, while after 4 h of electrolysis, MeOH formation became negligible. UV–visible spectra of the postelectrolysis CoPc molecule from the electrode revealed an undesired reduction of the Pc ligand, eventually leading to hydrogenation of the macrocycle. To avoid the reductive deactivation, Wang and co-workers introduced four electron-donating amino groups in the β position of the CoPc moiety (Figure 1b, CoPc-NH2), which successfully lowered the overpotential and could sustain activity for a longer time with a maximum FECH3OH of 32%.Figure 1Figure 1.

(8) Under heterogeneous conditions in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution (pH = 7.2), they obtained only 0.3% FECH3OH at −0.88 V vs RHE, which increased to 2% when they used CO as substrate instead of CO2. However, at pH 13, when CO was used as a substrate, the same CoPc/MWCNT system exhibited 14.3% FECH3OH at −0.68 V vs RHE, i.e., a 50-fold increase in selectivity at a 170 mV lower overpotential, along with a 10-fold increase in catalytic rate. Subsequent HPLC experiments showed that during CORR at pH 13, formaldehyde (HCHO) is formed. At alkaline pH, there is a chance of Cannizzaro reaction, i.e., a disproportionation of HCHO (aldehyde without α hydrogens) to CH3OH and HCOO– causing an overestimation of CH3OH's FE determination. Knowing that, Robert and co-workers carefully evaluated these nonfaradaic CH3OH formations and concluded that their effect is negligible. In addition, a series of control experiments, along with Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the CoPc before and after electrolysis proved that the observed reactivity was not due to the decomposition of CoPc into metallic Co nanoparticles, thus signifying the molecular nature of the catalyst.Lately, McCrory et al. further investigated the catalytic properties of the CoPc/MWCNT system using a gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) flow-cell. Compared to a conventional H-cell configuration, performing the electrocatalytic reaction in a CO2-fed GDE setup showed appreciably suppressed activity toward MeOH formation. The key explanation for these results lies at the higher CO2 binding affinity of CoPc compared to its affinity to bind CO, as quantitatively measured in this study. (6) The authors varied the partial current density of MeOH (product of CORR) at −0.70 V vs RHE as a function of the partial pressure of CO (PCO), which ultimately reached a plateau at PCO = 1. Thereafter, using a microkinetic analysis, the binding constant of CO to CoPc (KCO) was determined to be 3.0 atm–1. On the contrary, in the case of a CO2RR reaction with CoPc (where the major product is CO), extracted KCO2 was 11.1 atm–1. The high binding constant ratio of KCO2/KCO = 3.7, provides a thermodynamic explanation for the inefficient MeOH formation on CoPc/MwCNTs during CO2RR, where catalyst-bound CO is preferentially displaced by CO2 molecules before it can be further reduced. Thus, the authors suggested that researchers should look forward in the direction of controlling the local concentration of CO2 by construction of catalyst–polymer composites, or via applying modifications to the coordination environments of CoPc. These strategies will strengthen the CO binding, especially when using GDE flow-cells.As opposed to CoPc, in case of metal porphyrins, up until recently, reports of CO2 reduction into multielectron compounds were only available when conducted under photochemical conditions. (10,11) Lately, however, Dey and co-workers designed a distal superstructure in the molecular framework of iron porphyrins, and were able to stop the dissociation of CO from the metal-bound intermediate and simultaneously activated it for further reduction. In this work, an iron porphyrin having a distal basic pyridine residue was synthesized (FeL2, Figure 1C) and used as homogeneous electrocatalyst for CO reduction to CH4, with 93% FE. (2) Spectro-electrochemistry coupled FTIR (FTIR-SEC) was employed to understand the mechanism of the reaction with in situ detection of the metal–carbonyl species, using 12/13CO isotope sensitive absorption. In CO-saturated CH3CN containing 3% H2O, they identified an FeII–CO species being reduced to FeI–CO at applied potential of −1.75 V vs Fc/Fc+, followed by the reduction of FeI–CO to Fe0-CO at −2.35 V vs Fc/Fc+. Interestingly, while holding the potential at −2.35 V for a long period, an FeII–CHO adduct was detected, which then could be further reduced to CH4. In this case, pyridine mediated hydrogen-bonding between water molecules (i.e., proton source) and FeI–CO intermediate allows its stabilization, and activation for further reduction to CH4 (as evidenced by DFT calculation).In another attempt to achieve multielectron CO2 reduction using porphyrins, our group adopted a different approach, based on a photoassisted electrocatalysis pathway for multiproton/multielectron CO2RR. To do so, we have utilized photoactive Co-porphyrin (CoTCPP)-based metal–organic framework (MOF) films (Co-MOF-525). Under 1-sun light illumination (100 mW/cm2), the MOF film can sustain large quantities of long-lived oxidized charged carriers during photocathodic operation and performed a 8e–/8H+ reduction of CO2 to CH4 (in 80/20 (%v/v) CH3CN–H2O with a LiClO4 electrolyte). (9) Subsequent, photoassisted chronoamperometric measurements revealed that in the potential window of −0.39 to −0.64 V, CH4 and CO were produced during CO2RR, with a maximum FECH4 being 14% at −0.49 V, while FECO was only 2%. Yet, in the absence of light illumination, both products were formed in a very negligible amount. At more cathodic potentials, a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) became more prominent and significantly suppressed CO2RR. Generally, CoITCPP is the CO2RR active state that binds CO2 and undergoes 2e–/2H+ reduction to CO. However, thin layer spectro-electrochemical measurements revealed a different mechanism that leads to the unexpected CH4 production. Under dark electrolysis conditions, spectro-electrochemistry analysis showed the formation of bands attributed to CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+, while measurements at more cathodic potentials showed the formation of a new band corresponding to CO2RR active species, [CoITCPP]−. Surprisingly, in photoassisted electrolysis conditions, the formation of a broad band at 460 nm was noticed, suggesting the existence of a higher oxidation form of the catalyst, namely, [CoIIITCPP]2+, which was the product of a porphyrin ring oxidation. Here, with an increase in the cathodic potential, the [CoIIITCPP]2+ band decreased in intensity, while the CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+ bands remained unchanged throughout the course of the reaction. In other words, in these conditions, MOF-525 maintains a high concentration of [CoIIITCPP]+ species (via photo-oxidative accumulation of holes), which is known to stabilize CO by preferentially binding with it, (12) a crucial step that allows its further reduction to CH4.To conclude, despite severe challenges posed in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multielectron products, successful reports of molecular catalysts capable of CO2RR beyond 2e–/2H+ have increased lately. The results highlighted herein could help pave the way toward (i) rational catalyst design, (ii) improved structure–function correlation studies, and (iii) identification of key mechanistic factors necessary to understand molecular catalyst operation both in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous configurations. Nevertheless, realizing the next-generation of molecular catalytic systems will have to involve new approaches for the stabilization of key reactive intermediates while developing means for their assembly onto porous functional supports that allows the incorporation of secondary-sphere interactions to stir the CO2RR path toward the desired products.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsArnab Ghatak - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3027-9359; Email: [email protected]Idan Hod - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4837-8793; Email: [email protected]Author ContributionsThe manuscript was written through contribution of all the authors.

Electricity is fundamental to modern societies and will become even more so as its use expands through different technologies and population growth. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions globally, but it is also the sector that is leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid rise of renewables. The impacts of COVID-19 on the electricity sector led to a reduction in the demand for electricity, while at the same time, the current global energy crisis has placed the security and affordability of electricity at the top of the political agenda in many countries. In this way, the decrease in the demand for electricity, as well as its gradual recovery, makes it necessary to carry out energy planning that considers the adverse effects caused by global events with a high socioeconomic impact. In this article, the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) 2020 software has been used to determine the distribution of energy sources to 2050 for Mexico. The variables that lead to the possible profiles for 2050 are social, economic, and technological. The results correspond to a possible future based on official data from the National Electric System (SEN) of Mexico. The forecast for 2050 indicates that the electricity sector will have almost double the current installed capacity; however, emissions do not correspond to twice as much: they are practically 50% higher.

In order to protect our planet's climate, it is important to reduce humanity's carbon dioxide emissions significantly. The energy sector is one of the most polluting industries, but the rapid spread of renewable energy sources over the past 20 years can significantly contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The study examined which energy sources are used to produce electricity in Hungary, and how the proportion of renewable energy has developed in recent years compared to more polluting energy production methods. There is a strong negative exponential relationship between the share of renewable energy and the carbon dioxide emissions of the energy sector, based on which the carbon dioxide emissions of the energy sector can be significantly reduced by increasing the share of renewable energy. A forecast was made for the renewable share based on past data and the revised state of the National Energy and Climate Plan in 2023, and a linear forecast was made for the energy sector's emissions. There is a strong exponential relationship between the data series. Both models examined in the study had strong explanatory power, but neither model supports the possibility of climate-neutral energy production by 2030.

Predicting carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for addressing climate change and achieving environmental sustainability. Accurate emission forecasts provide policymakers with a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of policies, facilitating the design and implementation of emission reduction strategies, and helping businesses adjust their operations to adapt to market changes. Various methods, such as statistical models, machine learning, and grey prediction models, have been widely used in carbon dioxide emission prediction. However, existing research often lacks comparative analysis with other forecasting techniques. This paper constructs a new Discrete Fractional Accumulation Grey Gompertz Model (DFAGGM(1,1) based on grey system theory and provides a detailed solution process. The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is used to find the hyperparameters in the model. By comparing it with five benchmark models, the effectiveness of DFAGGM(1,1) in predicting carbon dioxide emissions data for China and the United States is validated.

To address the increasingly severe issue of carbon dioxide emissions, the Chinese government has set dual carbon goals: achieving peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Studying the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions is crucial for achieving these dual carbon goals and promoting sustainable development. Using balanced panel data from 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region from 2006 to 2019, this paper empirically analyzed the relationship and mechanisms of highway transportation infrastructure’s impact on carbon emissions using fixed effects models, mediating effects models, and threshold effects models. The empirical results indicate: (1) there is a nonlinear inverted-U-shaped relationship between highway transportation infrastructure and carbon emissions; (2) highway transportation infrastructure indirectly affects carbon emissions through foreign direct investment as a mediating variable; (3) the threshold effect model verifies that the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions exhibits threshold effects based on green technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. This study enriches the research content in related fields to some extent and provides specific policy recommendations for achieving carbon reduction goals and promoting sustainable development.

Abstract The use of green renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable chemicals and fuels through CO 2 electrolysis technology (also known as electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction, eCO 2 RR) is an advantageous technology, which could greatly aid the global carbon‐neutral goal. Although progress has been made in alkaline/neutral media, low carbon conversion efficiency to target products, carbonate/bicarbonate salt precipitation, and blockage of electrode holes caused by CO 2 are not conducive to industrial applications. Acidic media could address these issues; however, in these conditions, there are other challenges that need to be addressed, such as hydrogen evolution, poor tolerance of electrocatalysts, and electrolysers. This review discusses recent advances in industrial‐level acidic CO 2 electrolysis, including reaction mechanisms, electrocatalysts, and device design, aiming to promote its commercialization. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation strategy of an acidic eCO 2 RR system is proposed, and perspectives are provided based on related discussion.

The growing need for clean and renewable energy sources, driven by a shortage of fossil fuels and serious environmental concerns, has made finding catalysts for energy conversion applications a significant challenge. The key reactions essential for converting and producing green energy include the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Recently, the novel and rapid expansion of coordination materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), porous coordination polymers (PCPs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have led to the creation of remarkable properties, allowing the development of heterostructures for various applications in different fields. Enhancing clean energy production efficiency is considered the essential promise of coordination materials, with their controlled structures, effective functionalizations, large surface areas, and high porosity. In this chapter, we summarize the brief overview of multifunctional coordination materials and their applications for green energy production.

Abstract. A growing body of evidence suggests that to achieve the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will likely be required in addition to massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions. Nature-based CDR, which includes a range of strategies to sequester carbon in natural reservoirs, could play an important role in efforts to limit climate warming to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels. Agricultural CDR could enhance soil carbon sequestration, though the climate efficacy of such methods remains uncertain. Here, we use an intermediate complexity climate model to perform simulations of agricultural CDR in the form of soil carbon sequestration at a range of possible rates for different costs under three future emissions scenarios. We found that plausible levels of agricultural CDR were able to reduce CO2 concentration by 5–19 ppm and global surface air temperature by 0.02–0.10 °C by the end of century. This temperature decrease was non-linear with respect to cumulative removals, as any carbon removed remained part of the active carbon cycle, lessening the climate benefit compared to if the removed carbon was permanently stored in geological reservoirs. CDR was found to be more effective at reducing surface air temperature in low emissions scenarios, but less effective at reducing atmospheric CO2, compared to high emissions scenarios. This was because the weaker CO2 sinks in a high CO2 world had a more muted response to removal, so a substantially higher proportion of carbon was removed from the atmosphere for a given amount of CDR in a higher emissions scenario. The enhanced temperature response to CDR in lower emissions scenarios was due to the logarithmic response of radiative effects to changes in CO2, where at low atmospheric CO2 concentrations, small changes in CO2 are more effective at changing the global radiative balance than at higher CO2 concentrations. CDR was substantially more effective when implemented at a higher rate, as CDR makes a proportionally larger difference in a climate with lower cumulative air fraction of CO2. Land and soil carbon responses were driven by the scenario-dependent balances between the impacts of CDR on primary productivity from CO2 fertilization, and the impacts on soil respiration from increased soil carbon availability and global temperatures.

Synergistic control of the emissions of air pollutants and CO2 is critical to the dual challenges of air quality improvement and climate change in China. Based on the emission inventories of thermal power units in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, this study analyzes the CO2 and NOX emission characteristics of these units, and identifies and quantifies the synergistic drivers affecting these emission trends. The inventory data show that, between 2010 and 2020, NOX emissions were reduced by 86.1%, while CO2 emissions were reduced by only 29.8%. Although significant progress has been made in reducing NOX emissions through measures such as end-of-pipe treatment, controlling CO2 emissions remains a difficult task. The index decomposition analysis reveals that economic growth is the main driver of CO2 and NOX emission growth, energy intensity reduction is the main driver of CO2 emission reduction, and end-of-pipe treatment is the main driver of NOX emission reduction. Currently, coal occupies about 87% of the energy consumption of thermal power units in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, and remains the main type of energy for synergistic emissions, and the potential for emission reduction in the energy structure remains huge. For NOX emissions, it is expected that 90% of the reduction potential can be achieved through energy restructuring and end-of-pipe treatment. In conclusion, this high-precision unit-by-unit emission study confirms the effectiveness of the control policy for thermal power units in the region and provides some scientific reference for future policy formulation.

The aim of the article is to select and substantiate the technology of blast-furnace (coke-free) steel production, which can be used in Ukraine, taking into account the existing raw material base, the provision of the necessary energy resources and other specific conditions of the country. Technologies of direct reduction of iron (coke-free metallurgy), which are of industrial importance, are based on the interaction of iron ore (in the form of pellets) with synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide). In this case, hydrogen is used as an iron reducing agent, and carbon monoxide is burned with the release of heat necessary for the chemical reaction to take place. Synthesis gas on an industrial scale is produced either by steam catalytic conversion of natural gas or by coal gasification. Production of synthesis gas from natural gas can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to coke oven metallurgy (from 1.4–1.7 to 0.328 tons of carbon dioxide per 1 ton of iron). Yet, in the current conditions of Ukraine, this technology cannot be used due to the shortage of natural gas and high prices for it. Direct reduction of iron by synthesis gas obtained from coal in Ukrainian conditions has great prospects due to the presence of large reserves and developed coal mining of those grades of coal that are most suitable for gasification. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with this technology can be achieved if synthesis gas with a hydrogen content of more than 67% is obtained at the gasification stage. The article also discusses the prospects of hydrogen metallurgy, in which only hydrogen obtained by electrolysis of water is used as a reducing agent and a source of heat necessary for the reaction. Under the current conditions of Ukraine, the only source of electricity for electrolysis can be considered a specially built solar power plant. It is calculated that a power plant with a capacity of more than 100 MW is required to produce 1 million tons of direct reduced iron. The possibility of constructing a complex for the production of direct reduced iron using only hydrogen requires further research.

Abstract Limiting the global warming impact requires a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to reach a zero-carbon growth by 2050. Against this backdrop, turbomachinery designers are asked to develop more compact, efficient, and reliable machines. The research focuses on developing machines able to reduce energy losses and overall footprint, thus improving power plants efficiency and operability. To this end, expander-compressors (EC) seem to play a key role in the energy transition and appear a promising technology for high-density plants, especially together with hydrogen (H2) or supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as working fluid. However, when operating conditions changes, a reduction in machine efficiency may be expected, with a consequent degradation of the overall system performance. In order to optimize the operation of the power plant, it is crucial to understand how the variation of the expander-compressor behavior affects the working conditions of the other components of the plant. In this perspective, a fast and reliable way to estimate the EC performance at different operating conditions is necessary. Although the scientific literature shows several studies on mean-line approaches for expanders and centrifugal compressors, the joint use of 1D models with artificial neural networks (ANN) for ECs combined machine is still overlooked. To fill this gap, the prediction of artificial intelligence (AI)-based performance maps is proposed in this work. The tool has been tested in a case study based on a real EC. Results showed a rapid evaluation of EC efficiency while varying the operating conditions.

The global climate is currently warming due to human activity. The period 2011–2020 was recorded as the warmest decade. CO2 produced by human activity is the biggest contributor to global warming. Since every ton of CO2 emitted contributes to global warming, all emissions reductions can help to slow it down. Currently, the cars used by the population still do not ensure a sufficient reduction of CO2 emissions. The purpose of paper is to investigate the potential of electromobility development as a means to mitigate CO2 emissions in EU countries. The research methodology: statistical and comparable analysis of environmental and economic factors influencing the electromobility development in EU countries during last decade were performed. The conclusions of paper provide results of electromobility development, the main obstacles and needed government policies and incentives.

Abstract A sealed reciprocating tribometer has been used to study the influence of different gaseous environments on the friction and wear properties of AISI52100 bearing steel at atmospheric pressure and 25 °C. Helium, argon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen all give high friction and wear, suggestive of very little, if any tribofilm formation under the conditions studied. Dry air and oxygen also give high friction, slightly lower than the inert gases, but produce extremely high wear, much higher than the inert gases. This is characteristic of the phenomenon of “oxidational wear”. The two gases ammonia and carbon monoxide give relatively low friction and wear, and XPS analysis indicates that this is due to the formation of adsorbed ammonia/nitride and carbonate films respectively. For the hydrocarbon gases studied, two factors appear to control friction and wear, degree of unsaturation and molecular weight. For the saturated hydrocarbons, methane and ethane give high friction and wear but propane and butane give low friction after a period of rubbing that decreases with molecular weight. The unsaturated hydrocarbons all give an immediate reduction in friction with correspondingly low wear. Raman analysis shows that all the hydrocarbons that reduce friction and wear form a carbonaceous tribofilm on the rubbed surfaces. Graphical Abstract

The transition from fossil fuel-powered buses to electric buses has emerged as a central concern in recent years. Governments worldwide are urging this shift in major urban centers as a strategic response to ecological challenges, particularly issues related to pollution and carbon emissions. The primary impediment to the electrification transition lies in real-world financial constraints. Consequently, comprehending both the ecological benefits and financial intricacies of transitioning bus fleets is paramount.In the initial section of this paper, we formulate a mathematical model to assess the reduction in carbon emissions and pollution resulting from a complete transition of the bus fleet. This model is then applied to the city of Sendai, Japan. By comparing the carbon dioxide and emission gases released by conventional buses with those emitted by electric buses, we can discern the impact of employing electric buses on the urban ecological environment.Moving on to the second section, we present a mathematical model delineating the financial aspects of the transition. We use Sendai as a real-world exemplar for our model. The economic model is categorized into expenditures and revenues. Expenditures encompass the acquisition of electric buses, maintenance costs, and carbon taxes. On the income side, we consider bus fares, revenue from bus advertising, the budget of the bus company, and government subsidies. By subtracting expenditures from revenues, we can ascertain the financial ramifications of transitioning to electric buses.Following the evaluation from both ecological and financial perspectives of the bus fleet's electric transition, a third model is constructed mathematically to address the optimal planning solution for a city aiming to fully electrify its bus fleet within a decade. The objective is to achieve cost-efficiency: to be the most economical while meeting ecological goals. Finally, the cities of Sendai, Kunshan, and Nashville serve as subjects for our model, each providing a tailored solution to the transition planning.

Abstract Background Acne vulgaris poses a significant dermatological challenge, necessitating alternative treatments due to limitations and side effects associated with current therapies. This pilot clinical trial investigated the feasibility and efficacy of precision cryotherapy for acne vulgaris. Methods A total of 20 volunteers underwent targeted precision cryotherapy using a carbon dioxide‐based device. Treatment outcomes were assessed using various parameters, including Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, acne lesion count, erythema index (EI), global evaluation score, and participant satisfaction. Safety monitoring included adverse event reporting and physical examination. Results Precision cryotherapy demonstrated a significant reduction (90.25%) in the acne lesion count by week 4, with clinical improvement indicated by IGA score reduction ( p < 0.001). The EI showed notable improvements at weeks 1, 2, and 4. The global evaluation score demonstrated a 75%–100% clinical improvement at Visit 4. Participants reported high satisfaction (6.75 ± 0.79) with the procedure. No adverse event or discomfort was reported. Conclusion Precision cryotherapy effectively improved acne lesions, which was safe and satisfactory for participants. These findings suggest its potential as an alternative therapeutic modality, especially for populations with limited treatment options. Further research is needed to validate the results and explore underlying mechanisms.

Abstract The Hydrate-based CO2 Storage/Sequestration technique has the potential to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 by enabling efficient and safe storage of CO2. This paper explores the potential of CO2 storage through gas hydrate formation in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, an innovative approach to mitigating climate change by reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. The current applications and potentials of gas hydrates are examined, highlighting their role in energy production, CO2 reduction via oceanic injection, energy storage, and other uses. Geological considerations are analyzed, emphasizing the self-sealing potential of CO2 hydrates, the mechanisms of CO2 sequestration through hydrate formation, and the impact of hydrate presence on reservoir permeability. Simulation studies provide insights into the feasibility and efficiency of this method. Various approaches for CO2 hydrate sequestration are discussed, outlining the practical steps and technological requirements involved. The environmental implications and potential challenges of CO2 hydrate sequestration are evaluated, considering the ecological impacts and long-term sustainability. This comprehensive review suggests that while CO2 storage through gas hydrate formation in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs holds significant promise, it necessitates further research and technological advancements to address the identified challenges and fully realize its potential as a viable climate mitigation strategy.

In this study, we explore a novel approach to nitrogen oxide (NOx) purification based on the principles of the chemical looping (CL) platform. This technique harnesses the reducing power of natural gas (CH4), instead of ammonia, to eliminate NOx in the flue gas, addressing environmental concerns such as ammonia slip in the state-of-the-art selective catalytic reduction process. The CL scheme involves utilizing nickel oxide (NiO) as the solid oxygen carrier to facilitate oxygen transfer from NOx to CH4 in two steps. In the first step (carrier oxidation), NOx in the flue gas reacts with reduced nickel (Ni), transferring its [O] to the carrier, thereby forming NiO. In the subsequent step (carrier reduction), CH4 reacts with the lattice oxygen of the oxidized carrier, generating a pure stream of CO2 and reducing NiO to Ni. We designed a high-performance carrier by dispersing NiO on an inert support to enhance the carrier's kinetics and thermal stability. We evaluated various support materials, and among them, alumina (Al2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2) demonstrated significantly superior reactivity. Notably, the Al2O3-supported carrier outperformed the ZrO2-supported carrier in NO purification and CH4 reduction and demonstrated stable performance over 10 redox cycles. Furthermore, fixed-bed experiments revealed 100% NO conversion during carrier oxidation, with optimal reaction kinetics achieved at lower space velocities, resulting in an overall high carrier utilization. Importantly, CO2 showcased no adverse effects during the NOx purification step. During the carrier reduction, complete combustion was favored, leading to CH4 conversion exceeding 95% and a CO2 selectivity of 90% at 400 °C. The CL NOx purification approach represents a promising strategy for mitigating NOx emissions.

Abstract This paper presents the implementation of chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) on the offshore platform CB22F, detailing its impact over three years and proposing improvements for future deployments. It discusses the project's effects, such as increased oil production, reduced water cut, and lowered CO2 emissions, while sharing insights for optimizing future CEOR designs on two newly sanctioned platforms. The CEOR strategy on CB22F has shown significant outcomes, demonstrated by an increase in oil production, a reduction in water cut, and a decrease in CO2 emissions. Oil production increased by 663 of barrels per day (b/d), the water cut decreased from 90% to 80.5%, reducing the volumes of water handled. This decrease in water cut lowered energy consumption for water pumping and chemical treatment costs for produced water, leading to a reduction in cost and CO2 emissions to produce one barrel of oil. The test area began showing positive effects by June 2021, with a significant decrease in water content in produced fluids in 2022 and a rapid increase in oil output. By the end of March 2024, the water cut stabilized around 80.5%, and the cumulative oil increase from the 44 effective production wells reached 3,800,000 barrels, corresponding to a 4.27% increase in oil recovery. This cumulative increase translates to 28.9 tons of oil per ton of polymer injected, indicating the project's economic viability. Building on the success of CB22F, CEOR will be implemented on two newly sanctioned platforms with designs incorporating improvements learned from CB22F's experience. Bulk polymer delivery via pneumatic transfer will mitigate hoisting risks, improve occupational health, increase offshore storage capacity, and reduce delivery rotations, thus decreasing CO2 emissions associated with logistic operations. An integrated injection system will involve a centralized polymer injection system on the main platform, facilitating efficient distribution to both main and satellite platforms. The introduction of new Conical Pressure Reducer (CPR) skids, equipped with low shear valves, will regulate injection pressure, and adapt the polymer concentration for individual wells, minimizing polymer degradation and footprint compared to conventional methods. To address higher polymer/surfactant concentrations in produced fluids, concerns regarding emulsification are being managed through the development of new, high-efficiency water clarifiers. These improvements, guided by CB22F's experience, are expected to further optimize CEOR performance and efficiency on future platforms. This paper provides insights for engineers by demonstrating a successful CEOR implementation with concrete results and data, sharing practical improvements for future CEOR designs on offshore platforms, addressing potential challenges, and proposing viable solutions. Additionally, it contributes to knowledge on CO2 reduction strategies in oil and gas production, highlighting the environmental benefits alongside the financial gains. The reduction in CO2 emissions per barrel of oil produced underscores the broader impact of the project beyond immediate financial gains, contributing to the long-term sustainability of oil production operations.

The complexity of a sustainable economy is rooted in its socio-economic and environmental intricacies, particularly in formulating pathways for the harmonious integration of these parameters. This study introduces an extended input-output analysis and a multi-objective optimisation framework designed to discern trajectories for reducing CO2 emissions while simultaneously maximising GDP and employment. The economic alterations are evaluated through metrics facilitating the examination of both direct and indirect consequences stemming from perturbations within the economy. The focus of this research centres on the French economy, concentrating on pivotal sectors where reducing demand could yield the greatest reduction in CO2 emissions with minimal socio-economic ramifications. Additionally, a model is outlined for energy substitution, wherein fossil fuels in the French electricity mix are supplanted with clean energies. The ensuing effects of such a model on emission reduction pathways are scrutinised, followed by a comparison with the baseline case study.

Background: To test the ability of a low-pressure, low-flow, Heliox-based rebreathing system to reduce work of breathing and conserve gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels in a bench study. Methods: We performed a bench study of a novel low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber that was connected to an artificial lung simulator with careful monitoring of flow, pressure, work of breathing, oxygen (O2), carbon-dioxide (CO2), temperature, and humidity levels. Multiple runs of breathing were performed while manipulating levels of resistance (5 – 30 cm H2O/L/sec), gas mixtures (room air, 79% Helium 21% O2, and 70% Helium and 30% O2), and leak levels (ultra-low, low, and high). Results: We found significant reductions in work of breathing (up to 64%) while conserving gas with estimates of up to 54-fold reduction in medical gas wastage (P<0.001). Specifically, at resistances of 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm H2O/L/sec we demonstrated 64%, 57%, 36%, and 7% reduction in work of breathing (P<0.0001). Gas wastage was reduced by 10- to 54-fold while the end-tidal CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature were maintained by the device at physiological levels. Conclusions: In a bench-test, a low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber reduced work of breathing and conserved gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels. Future studies in human subjects need to be performed to determine whether reduction of work of breathing and gas conservation can be achieved.

Abstract A broad consensus of neutralizing the carbon dioxide emissions facilitates the transition to the renewable energy power system. Meanwhile, the concerns about the volatility of renewable energies are growing as the rotational inertia of power system becomes inadequate. To maintain the frequency stability of power system, some studies for configuring inertia energy storage systems (ESSs) are carried out, mainly focusing on the allocation of virtual inertia from grid‐forming ESS. In contrast, the allocation of virtual inertia from grid‐following ESS has not been well elaborated and the differences in virtual inertia provided by these two modes are yet to be revealed. Based on ‐norm and Kron reduction, firstly, the state‐space model of post‐disturbance system is established, together with the transient performance evaluation. Then the inertia characteristics of both grid‐forming and grid‐following devices are formulated, followed by the unified gradient descent optimization method for allocating virtual inertia. A modified IEEE 39‐bus system and its time‐domain simulations help in the verification of the contribution of this paper. Through the comparative analysis of corresponding optimal results, the conclusions from two aspects are drawn: in terms of transient frequency support, the grid‐forming devices can provide no less than better inertia support; with the higher power capacity and similar energy capacity, the grid‐forming devices can relieve the response pressure of other generators by approximately .

Abstract This work reports the production of polymeric nanocapsules of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/phase change materials (PCM), using continuous supercritical emulsion extraction (SEE‐C). Five fatty acids (FAs) were tested: capric (CA), lauric (LA), myristic (MA), palmitic (PA), and stearic (SA) acid, using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO 2 ) operating at 80 bar and 38°C in a tower apparatus. The two fatty acids with lower molecular weight (CA and LA) were extracted by the supercritical solvent and capsules were not obtained. The other three FAs formed spherical, non‐coalescing nanocapsules characterized by mean diameters ranging between 134 and 252 nm, as shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, with a sharp particles size distribution and encapsulation efficiencies up to 99.8%. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) analyses confirmed the successful encapsulation, allowing the measurement of the energy storage properties of produced capsules. Stability analysis performed over 5 months showed that the nanocapsules were stable in this time interval. Thermal cycles experiments confirmed the thermal stability of the capsules. The best performance was obtained for PA based nanocapsules, which showed a stability reduction of only 0.43% after 25 thermal cycles.

Abstract Carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme conserved across species, is pivotal in the interconversion of inorganic carbon (Ci; CO2 and HCO3–). Compared to the well-studied intracellular CA, the specific role of extracellular CA in photosynthetic organisms is still not well understood. In the green alga Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), carbonic anhydrase 1 (CAH1), located at the periplasmic space, is strongly induced under CO2-limiting conditions by the Myb transcription factor LCR1. While the lcr1 mutant shows decreased Ci-affinity, the detailed mechanisms behind this phenomenon are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to unravel the LCR1-dependent genes essential for maintaining high Ci-affinity. To achieve this, we identified a total of 12 LCR1-dependent inducible genes under CO2-limiting conditions, focusing specifically on the most prominent ones - CAH1, LCI1, LCI6, and Cre10.g426800. We then created mutants of these genes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, all from the same parental strain, and compared their Ci-affinity. Contrary to earlier findings that reported no reduction in Ci-affinity in the cah1 mutant, our cah1-1 mutant exhibited a decrease in Ci-affinity under high HCO3–/CO2-ratio conditions. Additionally, when we treated wild-type cells with a CA inhibitor with low membrane permeability, a similar reduction in Ci-affinity was observed. Moreover, the addition of exogenous CA to the cah1 mutant rescued the decreased Ci-affinity. These results, highlighting the crucial function of the periplasmic CAH1 in maintaining high Ci-affinity in Chlamydomonas cells, provide insights into the functions of periplasmic CA in algal carbon assimilation.

Abstract Microbial valorization of CO2-derived substrates has emerged as a promising approach to address climate change and resource scarcity. Formate, which can be efficiently produced from CO2, shows great potential as a sustainable feedstock for biotechnological production. However, the scope of formate assimilation pathways is restricted by the limited number of natural formate-assimilating enzymes. To overcome this limitation, several new-to-nature routes for formate assimilation based on its reduction to formaldehyde have been proposed, but they suffer from low catalytic efficiencies and cannot yet support bacterial growth. Here, we propose the Serine Shunt as a novel formate reduction route and demonstrate its activity in vivo. In this pathway, formate is attached to glycine to form serine, which is subsequently cleaved into formaldehyde and glycine, thereby effectively converting formate to formaldehyde. Unlike other formate reduction routes, the Serine Shunt mainly utilizes natural reactions with favorable enzyme kinetics, while requiring the same amount of ATP and NADPH as the most efficient new-to-nature route. We implemented the Serine Shunt in engineered Escherichia coli strains using a step-wise approach by dividing the pathway into metabolic modules. After validating the individual module activities, we demonstrated the in vivo activity of the complete Serine Shunt by measuring intracellular formaldehyde production with a GFP sensor and coupling its activity to cell growth. Our results indicate that the Serine Shunt could be applied as a novel formate reduction route in methylotrophic hosts relevant for biotechnology.

The increasing demand for energy, driven by technological advances, population growth, and economic expansion, has intensified the focus on efficient energy management. Tri-generation systems, such as Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) systems, are of particular interest due to their efficiency and sustainability. Integrating renewable energy sources like solar power with traditional fossil fuels further optimizes CCHP systems. This study presents a novel method for enhancing CCHP system efficiency by identifying optimal design parameters and assisting decision-makers in selecting the best geometric configurations. A mathematical programming model using the Harris Hawks optimizer was developed to maximize net power and exergy efficiency while minimizing CO2 emissions in a solar-assisted CCHP system. The optimization resulted in 100 Pareto optimal solutions, offering various choices for performance improvement. This method achieved higher net power output, satisfactory exergy efficiency, and lower CO2 emissions compared to similar studies. The study shows that maximum net power and exergy efficiency, with reduced CO2 emissions, can be achieved with a system having a low compression ratio and low combustion chamber inlet temperature. The proposed approach surpassed the response surface method, achieving at least a 4.2% reduction in CO2 emissions and improved exergy values.

A promising method for converting greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 into useful syngas is the dry reformation of methane (DRM). 5Ni-ZSM-5 and 2 wt.% Ce, Cs, Sr, Fe, and Cu-promoted 5Ni-ZSM-5 catalysts are investigated for the DRM at 700 °C under atmospheric pressure. The characterization, including XRD, TPR, TPD, TPO, N2 adsorption–desorption, TGA, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, revealed that the catalyst’s active sites are distributed throughout the pore channels and on the surface, contributing to the stability of the catalyst. Specifically, the CO2-TPO followed by the O2-TPO experiment using spent catalysts confirmed the oxidizing capacity of CO2 during the DRM reaction. The Ce-promoted catalyst showed the greatest increase in catalytic activity among other catalysts. The 5Ni+2Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited twice the concentration of acid sites compared to the Cs-promoted counterpart, even though both catalysts achieved similar quantities of active and basic sites. Without compromising H2 and CO selectivity, this finding underscores the crucial role of acid sites in enhancing CH4 and CO2 conversion. With a GHSV of 42,000 mL/(h.gcat), the 5Ni+2Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated impressive CH4 conversion rates of 42% at 700 °C and 70% at 800 °C. The reactants spend more time over catalysts during the subsequent reduction of GHSV to 21,000 mL/(h.gcat), resulting in the best catalytic performance with 80% CH4 and 83% CO2 conversions.

We report a series of isomeric, dicationic Re(bpy2+)(CO)3I complexes with bpy (2,2′-bipyridine) modified by two phenyl-CH2-(NMe3)+ pendants with cations located at variable distances from the active site for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in CH3CN/2.8 M H2O. The position of the cationic groups dramatically increases the rate of catalysis by ∼800-fold, from 1.2 to 950 s–1, with only a minor increase in overpotential. Acceleration is due to stabilization of the initial CO2 adduct and lowering of ΔG‡ for C–OH bond cleavage by Coulombic stabilization of anionic charges. Performance may be enhanced by accumulation in the electrochemical double layer. Transition state stabilization in the optimized isomer unlocks the low overpotential "protonation-first" pathway, highlighting the sizable effects of subtle structural optimization.

Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.

Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic-biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR-1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar-to-chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral-assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non-photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient-lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.

Abstract Within the energy sector, the mitigation of climate change necessitates a paradigm change towards the replacement of conventional with sustainable power generation technologies. Due to the inherent volatility of renewable power generation technologies, dispatchable components, such as gas turbines (GT) will have to be used increasingly for residual load balancing. In addition, GTs are expected to operate fewer hours per year, more flexibly, and at lower capacities. However, fuel utilization in GT is inherently linked to emissions. As a potentially CO2-free energy carrier, hydrogen is a promising fuel for GTs and manufacturers are working on suitable combustor technologies. However, the availability of large quantities of CO2-free H2 remains unclear in the near future. Other pollutants such as NOx and emissions due to incomplete combustion are formed differently in part-load. Therefore, optimizing natural gas substitution based on available H2 quantities and load profiles can improve the overall emission footprint beyond just reducing CO2 emissions. In this study, a physical-based gas turbine performance model and an emission calculation tool are used to derive an optimized H2 admixture strategy for different load profiles. Characteristic load demand scenarios are derived from actual load profiles of gas power plants and the emission footprints are comprehensively evaluated by different environmental impact categories. In general, the emission footprint is increased significantly and moderately for capacity reduction and flexibility increase of GT operation. The availability of H2 in the near future is derived from forecasts for Germany, and the corresponding quantities are allocated to the partial loads according to the optimized strategy. In most scenarios, the addition of H2 is associated with a reduction in emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel operation. The greatest leverage of H2 admixture in reducing the environmental footprint is found when applied from the lowest load up, thus assisting in the start-up and shut-down process.

Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. High concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, but they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate‐based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode‐electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen–bond (H–bond) network, which is attributed to the H–bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9% for CO can be achieved at 250 mA cm–2, simultaneous with a high single‐pass carbon efficiency of 72.2% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode‐electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.

In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate‐based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode‐electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen–bond (H–bond) network, which is attributed to the H–bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9% for CO can be achieved at 250 mA cm–2, simultaneous with a high single‐pass carbon efficiency of 72.2% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode‐electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.

On November 21, 2016, the world was shaken by a catastrophic epidemic thunderstorm asthma event which overtook the Melbourne, a city of over 5 million people in south-eastern Australia. Following heavy early seasonal spring rains which allowed a lush growth of vegetation, a 10 day long hot dry spell in late spring was broken by a cool change and thunderstorms crossing over the city at 6 pm. A large proportion of the unsuspecting population was mainly outdoors, enjoying the beaches to cool off, or commuting on the way home from work. Within hours, hospital emergency departments were inundated as thousands of people presented with symptoms of respiratory distress and ambulances were overwhelmed with distress calls for help. The official figures of 3365 excess public hospital emergency department presentations with respiratory-related cases and 476 excess asthma-related hospital admissions (a 7-fold and 10-fold increase above average respectively) underestimate the thousands of others who presented to general practitioners and community pharmacies seeking relief.1 This dramatic event brought into sharp relief the story of thunderstorm-related respiratory symptoms which have been described globally now for over 40 years. Initially reported in the United Kingdom in 1983, dozens of events have been reported in diverse geographical regions including Canada, USA, Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Northern China, Australia and New Zealand.2 The Melbourne 2016 event was the deadliest by far with 10 fatalities, with 5 fatalities reported subsequently in Kuwait in 2016, and previously reported events (in UK and Australia) with single fatalities (Table 1). What have we learnt and how can we be better prepared to prevent or mitigate the risk of future events? These thunderstorm respiratory events arise from a common complex interaction of environmental and individual susceptibility factors. Main environmental factors include high concentrations of an aeroallergen and the presence of thunderstorms. Allergens which have been described include various mould species (Didymella exitalis, Myxomycetes and Alternaria sp.), weed (Parietaria/Urticaceae sp. and Amaranthaceae sp.), mugwort (Artemisia sp.), olive tree (Olea europaea) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pollens.3 Thunderstorm characteristics include outflows with colder air associated with the down draft from the thunderstorm, sweeping up pollen grains and particles and then concentrating them in a shallow band of air bringing atmospheric aeroallergens to ground level. For ryegrass pollen triggered events, evidence suggests thunderstorm moisture and rainwater ruptures ryegrass pollen grains by osmotic shock, releasing fine (<2.5 μm) allergen-bearing starch-granules respirable to the lower airways. This allows bypass of the usual upper airway filter and trigger acute bronchospasm via a putative direct lower airway allergen challenge, even in those not previously known to be asthmatic. Individual risk factors include prior allergen sensitization and exposure, with the presence of rhinitis being both a marker of allergic sensitization as well as a risk factor for latent and undiagnosed asthma. In those with diagnosed current asthma, low adherence to preventive inhaled steroids increases thunderstorm asthma risk. Other factors more recently identified include Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score >1.5, ryegrass pollen specific IgE > 10.1 kU/L, raised eosinophil counts, and raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level.4 The effect of climate change on allergenic pollen and weather patterns and their impact on health and healthcare services is a burgeoning area of concern. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and temperatures have important effects on plants, their pollen production, and the consequent burden of atmospheric allergens.5 Seasonal variations and increases in temperature affect the timing of the pollen season for some plants, including starting pollen release earlier and lasting longer. In addition, significant increases in pollen allergenicity have been reported as associated with increasing CO2 and temperature. Climate change can also increase the likelihood of extreme weather events, such as thunderstorms and unseasonal rainfall promoting luxuriant plant growth, alternating with hot dry spells promoting pollen release.5 Air pollution that is also influenced by climate change significantly exacerbates the risk and severity of thunderstorm asthma by interacting with pollen, enhancing respiratory sensitivity, and contributing to a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs.2 Understanding this relationship is crucial for preventing and managing thunderstorm asthma, particularly in urban areas where pollution levels are high. Improved understanding of these risk factors for thunderstorm asthma leads to consideration of the following preventive strategies at the individual, public health and environmental level. For individuals with asthma, access and adherence to an inhaled steroid/fast onset long-acting bronchodilator (ICS/LABA) medication (such as a budesonide and formoterol combination inhaler) during the pollen season should be promoted. Those with allergic rhinitis need to be treated with preventive therapy such as intranasal steroids, with consideration of, and access to ICS/LABA inhalers especially if there are any respiratory symptoms suggestive of latent or undiagnosed asthma. Allergen specific immunotherapy (if available) can also be considered as primary or secondary preventive risk reduction strategies.6 At the public health level, pollen monitoring can facilitate pollen forecasting and warning systems, to allow pollen sensitive individuals to stay indoors and avoid exposure to harmful pollen levels. In the Australian state of Victoria, following the Melbourne 2016 event, a thunderstorm asthma forecasting system during the pollen season has been implemented which combines meteorological and grass pollen forecasts to produce daily forecasts of low, moderate, or high thunderstorm asthma risk. During high-risk days with high airborne pollen concentrations (>50 pollen grains/m3) and severe thunderstorms with strong winds, public health messages are promoted through public and social media to stay indoors, and for those at risk with asthma and allergic rhinitis to have available and take their inhaled/intranasal medication. Health services are also put on alert for thunderstorm asthma outbreak response preparedness. These strategies need to be tailored for particular geographical regions' health system resources and thunderstorm asthma risk profile (Figure 1). Lastly, climate change is a global health concern at multiple levels. There is an urgent need to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change on human health. Emissions reduction and air quality improvement (through reducing fossil fuel use and increasing environmental biodiversity and green spaces) and promoting sustainable agricultural practices will help to reduce the impact of climate change.7 The paradigm and catastrophic potential of epidemic thunderstorm asthma emphasises the need to take urgent action in order to write a new ending to an old story.

The air quality in educational campuses affects the health and work efficiency of teachers and students. Studies into this matter are of great significance for optimizing the management of campus living environments. Low-cost online sensors to monitor PM2.5 and CO2 levels were used in typical functional areas of a university campus in Beijing, China, including offices, dormitories, leisure spaces, canteens, and laboratories. By comparing the findings with data from nearby national monitoring stations, the seasonal and spatial variations in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations were analyzed. Findings indicate PM2.5 levels within the campus were notably lower compared to the surrounding urban environment. There was variation in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations across different functional areas. Typically, indoor PM2.5 levels were lower than outdoor ones, while CO2 concentrations in enclosed indoor spaces with human activities progressively escalated. The main internal emission sources affecting the PM2.5 level on campus included traffic emissions, dust generated by human activities, and emissions from catering. In contrast, in areas with better green coverage or where a lake system participates in the atmospheric circulation, the PM2.5 level and CO2/PM2.5 were lower. This indicates that the cleansing impact of plants and aquatic systems is instrumental in lowering PM2.5 concentrations, offering healthier leisure spaces. Seasonal variations also impact PM2.5 levels. During the non-heating period, less pollution source emissions led to decreased outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. The campus monitoring sites experienced an approximate 5 µg/m3 and 29 µg/m3 reduction in the average PM2.5 levels as compared to the PM2.5 of the surrounding urban environment, respectively, during the non-heating and heating period. During indoor activities or sleep, CO2 levels can build up to as high as 2303 ppm due to breathing. It is advisable to stay indoors on days when pollution levels are high, whereas on days with clean air, it is healthier to be outdoors or to air out indoor areas by opening windows. Our research provides clearer scientific evidence for incorporating behavioral strategies for improving air quality into both daily work and life. Moreover, the findings are quite meaningful for the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor monitoring in various environments, with applications beyond just the campus settings.

This manuscript highlights the mechanical, economical, ecological, and thermal investigations performed on paving quality geopolymer concrete (PQGC) incorporating processed steel slag (PSS) as a substitute for river sand (RSa). The replacement of RSa with PSS ranged from 0 to 100% in the PQGC mix. The mix with 100% PSS content exhibited enhanced geopolymerization, resulting in a denser and more amorphous matrix. This improved the mechanical properties, increasing compressive strength by 10.9%, flexural strength by 23.5%, and splitting tensile strength by 8.3%. The replacement of RSa with PSS in PQGC led to a marginal reduction in (embodied energy) EE and CO2 emissions. However, compared to conventional Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) and Fly Ash PQC (FPQC), the reduction in EE for PQGC was 44% and 34%, while the CO2 emissions of PQGC were reduced by 1.22 and 1.49 times. Despite these benefits, PQGC with 100% PSS was 19% and 30% more expensive than PQC and FPQC, respectively. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of PQGC was approximately one-third that of PQC and FPQC at all levels of replacement of RSa in PQGC when compared to PQC and FPQC. Additionally, thermal conductivity decreased from k = 0.67 W/m °C to k = 0.51 W/m °C with 100% replacement of RSa, keeping the concrete cooler. Therefore, PQGC with 100% PSS, when practically implemented, may help reduce surrounding temperatures. This study concludes that PSS is a feasible and reliable alternative to RSa, enhancing the sustainability of PQGC.

The massive forming industry in Germany produces around 1.4 million parts every year, which are mainly used in safety-relevant areas such as the automotive industry. The production of these parts requires a considerable amount of energy, much of which remains unused and causes high CO2 emissions. An efficient approach to reduce these emissions and improve material utilization is cross-wedge rolling, which enables efficient material utilization but is limited by the so-called Mannesmann effect, which leads to unwanted material defects. This paper describes the development and validation of a safe design criterion for cross-wedge rolling tools in order to avoid material damage caused by the Mannesmann effect and thus increase resource efficiency in forging. Based on simulation-supported investigations and experimental tests, process maps are created for various materials. The validation is carried out both in an experimental test facility with real tools and in an industrial production facility, which leads to a significant reduction in excess material and CO2 emissions. The results show that the full resource potential of cross-wedge rolling can be exploited by optimizing process parameters and tool geometries.

Large-scale cattle farming currently accounts for only 30% of the industry in China, where significant variation in farm sizes and distributions poses challenges to sustainable manure management. Moreover, substantial gaps exist in research on the environmental impacts of manure treatment technologies across different farm scales. The environmental and economic performances of eight different cattle manure management techniques, including six aerobic, three anaerobic, and integrated methods, were evaluated for small, medium, and large cattle farms using life cycle assessment and life cycle cost methods. The results indicate that the black membrane biogas pool (BMBP) offers the best environmental and economic benefits, reducing the global warming potential (GWP) by 101.3% and enhancing the profit by at least 148.7 CNY per ton of dry cattle manure. Significant disparities in cattle farming scale and manure production across provinces necessitate region-specific policies. The GWP from national cattle manure management stands at about 1.3 million tons of CO2 equiv, with major inputs from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia, comprising 25.2% of the total. Increasing the utilization rate of cattle manure from 80% to 90% by 2025 could reduce the GWP by 11.0%. Advancing the BMBP and shifting 5% of aerobic to anaerobic processes could reduce carbon emissions by 0.2 million tons of CO2 equiv and other pollutants by 1.1–23.4%. Therefore, enhancing anaerobic technology and boosting utilization rates promise more efficient and synergistic reductions in CO2 emissions and other pollutants.

Inspired by recent advances in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) under acidic conditions, herein we leverage in situ spectroscopy to inform the optimization of CO2R at low pH. Using attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and fluorescent confocal laser scanning microscopy, we investigate the role that alkali cations (M+) play on electrochemical CO2R. This study hence provides important information related to the local electrode surface pH under bulk acidic conditions for CO2R, both in the presence and absence of an organic film layer, at variable [M+]. We show that in an acidic electrolyte, an appropriate current density can enable CO2R in the absence of metal cations. In situ local pH measurements suggest the local [H+] must be sufficiently depleted to promote H2O reduction as the competing reaction with CO2R. Incrementally incorporating [K+] leads to increases in the local pH that promotes CO2R but only at proton consumption rates sufficient to drive the pH up dramatically. Stark tuning measurements and analysis of surface water structure reveal no change in the electric field with [M+] and a desorption of interfacial water, indicating that improved CO2R performance is driven by suppression of H+ mass transport and modification of the interfacial solvation structure. In situ pH measurements confirm increasing local pH, and therefore decreased local [CO2], with [M+], motivating alternate means of modulating proton transport. We show that an organic film formed via in situ electrodeposition of an organic additive provides a means to achieve selective CO2R (FECO2R ∼ 65%) over hydrogen evolution reaction in the presence of strong acid (pH 1) and low cation concentrations (≤0.1 M) at both low and high current densities.

Abstract Since their inception, CO2 power cycles have gained prominence for their superior performance and compactness. However, the efficiency of the simple supercritical CO2 cycle is hindered by relatively large temperature differences in the recuperator, leading to increased exergy destruction. Although complex cycles like the recompression or precompression cycles can reduce recuperator irreversibility, their higher complexity and additional equipment requirements raise the cost of the power plant. This paper aims to demonstrate that recuperator irreversibility in a simple recuperated transcritical cycle can be alleviated using CO2-based mixtures, without resorting to complex cycles. This is achieved by comparing the efficiencies of simple and recompression cycles using CO2-based mixtures with nine additives of various molecular complexities: H2S, SO2, C3H8, C4H10, C5H12, C6H6, C4H4S, TiCl4, and C6F6. The effect of additive molar fraction (ranging from 0.05 to 0.5) on the efficiency of both cycles is examined. Thermal efficiency optimisation reveals a correlation between the efficiency difference of the simple and recompression cycles and the molecular complexity of the working fluid. The reduction in recuperator irreversibility is attributed to the decrease in the difference in the isobaric specific heat capacities between the streams in the recuperator with the use of complex additives. Consequently, the advantage of a recompression cycle diminishes as the aggregate molecular complexity of the working fluid increases. Simple additives like H2S, SO2, and C3H8 result in recompression cycles outperforming simple recuperated cycles by 4% to 8% in terms of absolute thermal efficiency, depending on the additive and its molar fraction. Conversely, more complex additives like C4H4S, TiCl4, and C6F6, exhibit thermal efficiencies in simple recuperated cycles comparable to those of recompression cycles. The additive molar fraction at which both cycles achieve similar performances depends on the molecular complexity of the additive; the more complex the additive, the lower the additive molar fraction required to create a complex working fluid. Moreover, the split fraction in recompression cycles exhibits a similar correlation with molecular complexity as observed in the efficiency difference, suggesting that recompression cycles will morph into simple recuperated cycles as molecular complexity increases. In conclusion, the use of additives provides an additional dimension through which the efficiency of CO2 cycles can be optimised, enabling improved performance without the need for complex cycles.

Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies are critical to reducing CO2 exhalations on a global scale. This review study synthesizes the many elements of CCUS over 50 years, from R&D to deployment scales, in terms of their mitigation potential for global emission reductions. Next, it discusses existing and new carbon capture techniques from an automation standpoint (e.g., pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture combustion), as well as the economic feasibility of CCUS regionally in terms of capital retail price, operating expenses, and value in the form of potential revenue streams based on CO2, aided by significant range-scaling building blocks such as rising nation. Each technique is thoroughly evaluated in terms of its environmental impact and associated risks, and case studies are used to illustrate practical lessons learnt. The paper also discusses the arguments around what future advances may exist in CCUS technology, and opportunities to scale these up (including research needs for this support), drawing lessons past policy. The findings underscore the importance of integrating CCUS into broader climate strategies to achieve net-zero exhalations while addressing the economic and environmental challenges that remain.

To date, the use of ferrous hydrogen in metallurgy is considered from several positions. First, the partial or complete replacement of carbon with hydrogen reduces greenhouse gas emissions of CO2. Secondly, due to the different chemical affinity for oxygen, it becomes possible to selectively (selectively) extract components from complex complex ores and man-made materials. Thirdly, the absence of carbon in the reaction zone will make it possible to obtain a metal with a low content of carbides, which in many cases increases the demand for the product. Thermodynamic calculations of a multicomponent oxide system (Ni, Fe, P, Zn, Mn, V, Cr, O) in the presence of various reducing agents: carbon, hydrogen are performed using the TERRA software package, and their combined effects are considered. It is shown that the type of reducing agent affects the temperature of the beginning of the reduction of metals and the degree of their metallization. Thus, by selecting the type of reducing agent, its quantity, and the temperature of the process, it is possible to selectively extract some metals, and leave others in an oxidized state. Ilmenite concentrate in the form of a briquette was used in laboratory tests. The analysis of the iron reduction process using carbon or hydrogen as a reducing agent has been carried out. In comparison with the results obtained using carbon, the kinetics of iron reduction with hydrogen is higher. At the same time, the reduction proceeds with the formation of metallic iron, rutile (TiO2) and residual ilmenite. Whereas, in a carbothermic process occurring at higher temperatures (1000–1300 ℃), the reduction products are iron and iron ditanate (FeTi2O5). In addition, an important advantage of selective reduction by gas is the possibility of subsequent separation of the metallic and oxide phases by melting, without fear of secondary reduction due to solid carbon residues.

Abstract: Biodiesel has been defined as an alternative fuel that has the potential to be used instead of diesel fuel for years. In case of complete combustion reaction in engines, the products released do not directly threaten human health. Compared to diesel fuel, biodiesel has worse combustion performance due to some fuel properties. Therefore, incomplete combustion products such as hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), smoke emission and complete combustion products such as CO2 are thrown into the atmosphere. In this study, the changes in exhaust emissions of 50 ppm and 75 ppm Ag2O NPs were experimentally examined to improve the adverse combustion performance and emission characteristics of cottonseed oil methyl ester. In experiments, nano additive improved the thermal conductivity, mass dissipation and heat transfer of the test fuels, and resulted in reducing of CO emissions as it provided a higher oxidation rate of hydrocarbon molecules. Due to the improvement in the combustion reaction, CO2 emission increased with product of complete combustion. The increase in CO2 emissions was 3.17% and 3.97% for CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels, respectively, when compared to C0 fuel at 40 Nm load. The NPs additive increased the lower calorific value of the fuel and cylinder temperature. This situation caused increase of NOx emissions by 3.69% and 7.47% CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels 40 Nm load. Adding of NPs in base fuel reduced to viscosity and density provided better atomization. So a reduction in smoke emission was obtained with NPs addition by 35.09% and 47.32% in CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels, respectively, compared to C0 fuel at 10 Nm load, while 7.45% and 19.43% at 40 Nm load.

The steel industry accounts, according to the International Energy Agency, for ~6.7% of global CO2 emissions, and the major portion of its contribution is from steelmaking via the blast furnace (BF) route. In the short term, a significant reduction in fossil CO2 emissions can be achieved through the introduction of bio-coal into the BF as part of cold bonded briquettes, by injection, or as part of coke. The use of bio-coal-containing residue briquettes was previously demonstrated in industrial trials in Sweden, whereas bio-coal injection was only tested on a pilot scale or in one-tuyere tests. Therefore, industrial trials replacing part of the pulverized coal (PC) were conducted. It was concluded that the grinding, conveying, and injection of up to 10% of charcoal (CC) with PC can be safely achieved without negative impacts on PC injection plant or BF operational conditions and without losses of CC with the dust. From a process point of view, higher addition is possible, but it must be verified that grinding and conveying is feasible. Through an experimentally validated computational fluid flow model, it was shown that a high moisture content and the presence of oversized particles delay devolatilization and ignition, lowering the combustion efficiency. By using CC with similar heating value to PC, compositional variations in the injected blend are not critical.

Abstract Aviation is widely recognized as a significant source of air pollutant emissions, encompassing gaseous products such as CO2, CO, NOx, and particulate matter (PM), especially in the form of soot. This study conducted comprehensive emission measurements on an Allison 250 C20B turboshaft engine to investigate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) impact on emissions. Two conventional Jet A-1 fuel blends with 30% and 50% HEFA-SPK synthesized paraffinic kerosene derived from hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) content together with 100% HEFA-SPK were tested regarding their emissions and compared against neat Jet A-1. The study’s primary focus was quantifying ultrafine particulate matter in terms of number and size. The selection of distinct engine power settings was based on the thrust ratios specified in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Landing and Take-off-cycle (LTO-cycle). PM emissions were characterized using multiple measurement techniques. These included the application of two distinct electrical mobility analyzers. An additional concentration particle counter (CPC) was utilized to underscore the reliability of the findings. A standard FTIR/O2/FID system was used to assess gaseous emissions, a well-established method for measuring fundamental combustion products such as CO2, CO, unburned hydrocarbons (UHC’s) and NOx. The particle measurement systems revealed a decrease in both the number and size of particles with increasing HEFA-SPK content. This decrease in particle number appeared linear for the 30% and 50% HEFA-SPK blends and was more pronounced for the 100% HEFA-SPK. Furthermore, a more substantial reduction in PM emissions, reaching up to 82%, was observed at lower load settings, such as Ground Idle (GI), compared to higher load settings like Take-Off (TO), where the reduction was up to 40%. Results of the gaseous emissions are also presented in the study.

Products made from light olefins play an important role in our daily lives. Traditional light olefins production based on stream crackers and fluid catalytic cracking suffer from high energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Thereby, the continually increasing demand of light olefins needs to be met through more environmentally sustainable procedures. On‐purpose production routes are a preferred choice among petrochemicals manufacturers, being energy efficient and having lower carbon footprint. Among them, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light olefins is a thermodynamically favourable exothermic process as compared to non‐oxidative routes. They can be operated at lower temperatures and has low coke deposition on catalyst, thereby resisting rapid catalyst deactivation. Herein, we have analysed various catalytic systems utilised in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. We have reviewed role of support, chemical composition of catalyst, presence of dopant, oxidation state of active metal, controlled surface modification by oxidative and reductive pretreatments, and reaction factors for each system. The performance of various catalytic systems for ODH of ethane, propane and butane in the presence of O2, CO2, N2O and special oxidants have been reviewed. A short critical overview on emerging on‐purpose routes for the production of renewable 1,3 butadiene has also been discussed.

Shipping is a highly energy-intensive sector, and fleet decarbonization initiatives can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the short-to-medium term, internal combustion engines will continue to be used for propulsion or as electricity generators onboard ships. Natural gas is an effective solution which can be used to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the marine sector. Considered to be a transitional fuel, it can provide a potential reduction in CO2 emissions of around 20–30%, compared with conventional marine fuels. This work investigated the influence of diesel-injection strategies on the performance and emissions of a single-cylinder prototype compression-ignition engine for marine applications, retrofitted to run as a Low-Pressure Dual-Fuel Engine using natural gas. Two different injection systems were used: a mass flow controller enabling continuous-mode gas feeding, and a Solenoid-Operated Gas Admission Valve for marine applications, the latter allowing phased natural-gas injection. Experimental tests were focused on partial-load conditions, which are critical for dual-fuel engines, with a natural gas/diesel mass ratio of 4:1. Phased injection resulted in reductions in fuel consumption, compared to continuous mode, of up to 11%. Further experiments demonstrated reductions in fuel consumption of up to 20.7% (in equivalent diesel); on the other hand, the unburned hydrocarbon emissions which resulted were an order of magnitude larger than the reference values for full diesel, reducing the benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, with a reduction in Global Warming Potential of only 3% compared to full diesel.

Chemical looping (CL)-based oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) of ethane (C2H6) and successive CO2 activation to form CO were investigated on FeMTiOx catalysts (M = Ni, Sn, Co, Mn, Ce metal oxide), and a proper reduction extent of active metal oxides was found to be well correlated with C2H6 conversion as well as the amount of oxidized COx formation during the C2H6 activation step. The easily reducible FeCeTiOx showed a higher C2H6 conversion of 19.6% and an ethylene (C2H4) selectivity of 73.4% due to the higher redox property of the CeO2 promoter, which also showed a higher CO2 activation to CO with its productivity of 0.130 mmol/g due to the presence of abundant oxygen vacant sites with smaller crystallite sizes of active metal oxides. The fast oxygen transfer rate and thermal stability of Ce-incorporated FeTiOx were responsible for an enhanced ethylene productivity. The newly formed MnTiO3 phases with coexisting FeTiO3 phases on FeMnTiOx were found to be active sites for the CL-ODH reaction due to an increased number of stable lattice oxygens with the highest C2H4 selectivity of 80%. However, easy reducibility and facile aggregation of NiO and Co3O4 phases on FeNiTiOx and FeCoTiOx revealed a higher selectivity to COx in the range of 18.3–18.9% compared to the optimal FeCeTiOx with a lower COx selectivity of 14.4%. The lower C2H6 conversion on FeSnTiOx was also attributed to the suppressed redox properties of active metal oxides.

Reducing CO2 emissions is becoming a particularly important goal for motorcycle manufacturers. A fully electric transition still seems far away, given the difficulties in creating an electric motorcycle with an acceptable range and mass. This opens up opportunities for the application of hybrid powertrains in motorcycles. Managing mass, cost, and volume is a challenging issue for motorcycles; therefore, an MHEV architecture represents an interesting opportunity, as it is a low-complexity and low-cost solution. Firstly, in this work, an adequate sizing of the powertrain components is studied for the maximum reduction in fuel consumption. This is performed by analyzing many different system configurations with different hybridization ratios. A 1D simulation of the motorcycle traveling along the homologation cycle (WMTC) is performed, and the powerunit use strategy is optimized for each configuration using the Dynamic Programming technique. The results are analyzed in order to highlight the impact of kinetic energy recovery and engine load-point shifting on fuel consumption reduction. The results show the applicability of MHEV technology to road motorcycles, thus providing a useful tool to analyze the cost/benefit ratio of this technology. The developed methodology is also suitable for different vehicles once a specific test cycle is known.

Abstract Gas Turbines will need to reduce CO2 emissions and prove their flexibility based on market needs and new proposed rules [2]. Economically, utilizing existing gas turbine assets to meet these requirements will be of great benefit as compared to building new turbines. Even better, determining the lowest cost least intrusive upgrades required is of great interest to power producers. The demonstration described here was conducted on one (1) GT unit at the Constellation Hillabee power plant (Siemens Energy SGT6-6000G 2x1 configuration) which doubled the mass flow of hydrogen of previous record-breaking DLN demonstrations. The testing was done on an unaltered, existing GT asset, which provides great value for those GTs which are already providing power using natural gas. The demonstrated hydrogen blending percentage of 38.8% (resulting in approximately 18% reduction in CO2 emissions) proved the system capable of meeting the first BSER goals set forth in recent proposed US EPA gas turbine rules. Such demonstrations are of critical importance as they show the inherent capability to meet reduced carbon power generation requirements without more significant cost outlays. This report documents the evaluation, preparation, execution, and results from this demonstration testing. The results are provided for the gas turbine community to use as insight into the capability and flexibility of existing assets to meet the future demands of reduced carbon power generation. Specific information around safety, reliability, emissions, and operability are discussed to provide context around existing asset capability.

Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) is a widely prevalent geological resource underground, and its utilization offer significant energy conservation and emission reduction benefits, contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals. Assessing the development potential of regional SGE can ensure sustainable development of these resources and prevent adverse effects induced by overexploitation. Jiangsu Province, a developed region in the eastern coastal area of China, has a strong demand for cooling and heating in urban buildings. The primary form of utilizing SGE in this area is through vertical ground source heat pumps (VGSHP). Based on the analysis of the impact of regional geological conditions on the development of SGE, this study specifically evaluated the suitability of developing SGE through VGSHP. After excluding areas unsuitable for development, the heat exchange capacity, heating or cooling area per unit area, and energy conservation and emission reduction benefits of VGSHP were calculated. The results indicate that the area suitable and moderately suitable for developing SGE through VGSHP in Jiangsu Province amounts to 76,453 km2. The total heat exchange capacity for summer is 1.21 × 109 kW, which can provide cooling for an area of 1.21 × 1010 m2. The total heat exchange capacity for winter is 8.70 × 108 kW, which can provide heating for an area of 1.09 × 1010 m2. The annual available resource amount is 2.68 × 1012 kWh, equivalent to 3.30 × 108 tons of standard coal, and a CO2 reduction of 7.86 × 108 tons.

Abstract The industrial sector is a key global source of wealth, but it is also recognized as a major challenge toward worldwide decarbonization. Today the industrial sector requires more than 22 % of the global energy demand as thermal energy and produces for this about 40 % of the total CO2 emissions. Solutions to efficiently decarbonize the industrial sector are deemed. This work presents a comparative techno-economic performance assessment of a high temperature heat pump integration within a molten salts based power to heat system for industrial heat flexible generation. The main system performance is reported in terms of required working conditions and temperature for the heat pump and thermal demand size as well as reduction of the attainable levelized cost of heat (LCoH) against non-flexible electric boiler based systems. The impact of different industrial load profiles, electricity prices, heat pump capital cost and heat pump real to Carnot efficiency ratio are also presented. The results highlight that the proposed system can be cost-competitive, particularly for thermal demand around 10 MW and waste heat temperatures above 80°C. Under these conditions LCoH reduction higher than 15 %, with respect to the considered non-flexible electric boiler alternative, are attainable. These LCoH reductions are primarily driven by savings in electrical consumption as high as 30 %. This study sets the ground for further power-to-heat techno-economic investigations addressing different industrial sectors and identifies main system and components design strategies, integrations, and targets.

Abstract It is recognized that Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) will play a significant role in the decarbonization of air mobility and various pathways and feedstocks are considered for their production. This may lead to differences in chemical and physical properties when compared to conventional, fossil, aviation fuel (CAF). SAF available today are blended with CAF and after blending they are compliant with the Jet Fuel norm (ASTM1655). But the goal of achieving 100% SAF could be problematic, as the absence of aromatics, one of the characteristics of SAF produced today, could lead to leaks in the seal. Adding renewable aromatics (Synthesized Aromatic Kerosene, or SAK) to the SAF is therefore seen as an opportunity to reach 100% SAF without impacting the aircraft and airport’s fuel infrastructures, potentially enabling a faster decarbonization of the sector. In this study, we have compared the emissions of a 100% SAF which contains 9% of SAK issued from the biomass (SAF-SPK/A) with a CAF. Performance and behavior: The tests did not identify any performance differences between the two fuels, including turbine reactivity and equipment degradation. This was later confirmed by Bell Helicopter during an experimental test flight campaign. Emissions: the lower CO2 impact is mainly due to the life cycle analysis of the SAF, but the test also showed reduced CO2 emissions during the combustion. While NO and NOx were found equivalent, significant reduction in CO and soot (Smoke Number, SN) were measured: −20 to −50% depending on the mass fuel flow. These improvements could be explained by the lower content of aromatics as well as the nature of these aromatics and this will be further investigated in future studies.

The development of novel materials based on renewable materials with beneficial properties that assist with energy efficiency and conservation has been encouraged by increasing consciousness of environmental issues. This research intends to use sustainable cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) obtained from oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) as reinforcement to enhance the properties of rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF). RPUF reinforcement with varied CNC concentrations (0.25–1 wt%) was examined by foaming behavior, surface morphology, mechanical properties, thermal insulation properties, dimensional stability, efficiency energy study, and CO2 reduction through their thermal conductivity values. The results achieved an optimal improvement of mechanical properties of the RPUF composite by around 23.53% compared to RPUF control, at the addition of 0.5 wt% of CNC concentration while maintaining the density of 37–39 kg/m3. Further, incorporating CNC improved thermal insulating performance by 9.95%, as reflected by decreased thermal conductivity from 0.0292 W/mK to 0.0269 W/mK and decreased cell size by 28.12%. Finally, based on the energy and cost efficiency studies, RPUF-CNC composites offer up to 0.78 kWh/m2 and 0.031 kWh/m2 compared to conventional wall materials made of concrete and wood, respectively. Furthermore, it contributed to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 110 and 7.2 kg CO2/year compared to concrete and wood, respectively. This work demonstrates the promising use of eco-friendly building insulation materials to mitigate the energy and environmental crisis.

Ensuring food security with limited farm resources under a climate change scenario is a major challenge for agricultural scientists. Conventional farming uses ample fertilizers and pesticides for crop production, which badly impacts the environment. The key to sustainable agriculture is finding ways to boost productivity with sustainability. This chapter focuses on the importance of crop rotations for achieving the said goal by highlighted several benefits of implementing diversified crop rotations, including the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into plant biomass, improving system (pests, diseases, weed infestations, and abiotic and biotic stress) resilience, and enhancing water and fertilizer use efficiencies. Furthermore, legume-based crop rotations also benefit a significant reduction in the use of synthetic fertilizers and augment the sustainability of the agricultural production system. Thus, cropping rotation has become indispensable to transform agriculture and pave the way for a more sustainable future.

The first isolation and characterization of transition metal complexes with the parent Al(I)–H unit were achieved in base-stabilized forms. W and Fe complexes, Cp*(CO)n(H)M←:AlH(NHC)2 (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene, n = 1 or 2), were synthesized in 43–63% yields by the one-step reaction of Cp*M(CO)n(py)Me with H3Al·NHC. The characterization included 1H and 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and infrared (IR) spectroscopic analysis, as well as DFT calculations, which revealed the extremely strong σ-donating ability of the :AlH(NHC)2 ligand, and the highly polarized M(δ−)←:Al(δ+) coordination bonds. The monovalent oxidation state of the Al center of these complexes was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hydroalumination of carbodiimide and the reduction of CO2 to CO were also demonstrated.

The present work explores the viability of Palmyra oil methyl ester (POME) as a renewable biodiesel. Initially, oil is extracted from the Palmyra fruit and the oil is transesterified to produce Palmyra oil methyl ester. Preliminary tests were conducted with blends of Palmyra oil methyl esters. From the test results, it was found that the POME20 blend performed better than other blends and was considered as an optimised blend. Secondly, analysis was carried out with POME20 on the CI engine at three injection pressures (210bar, 230bar and 250bar). POME20 at 230bar was shown to have improved thermal efficiency and reduced emissions of CO, HC and CO2 except NOX emissions. Finally, the tests were repeated for optimal conditions of 230bar injection pressure along with 6% and 12% EGR rates. The experimental results revealed that POME20 operated at 230bar 6% EGR rate observed a drastic reduction of NOX by 32.08% and 57.49% compared to diesel and POME20.

The deposition of palladium on the aluminum surface by galvanic replacement from solutions of (1–10)mM PdCl2 + 50 mM Et4NCl in DMF was investigated. It is shown that the decoration of the aluminum surface with palladium occurs with the formation of PdNPs and porous Pd-nanofilms fragments. The concentration of PdCl2 and the duration of the process are the main factors that affect the controlled content of palladium on the aluminum surface. As these values increase, the size of palladium nanoparticles and the degree of filling of the substrate increases. It has been established that the reduction of CO2 on Al/Pdnanostructure cathodes in DMF solutions occurs at current values that are 2…2.5 times higher compared to those on aluminum cathodes. Furthermore, the icathode values decrease with the increase in the size of the Pd nanoparticles, which is identical to the increase in the content of palladium on the aluminum surface. Thus, at E = −3.0 V, the values of the cathode are 16.5, 13.9, and 11.0 mA × cm−2 at a Pd content of 1.9, 8.7, and 10.7 wt.%, respectively. This can be explained by the nanoscale effect.

Abstract The aim of this study is to analyze methodologies that can reduce performance impact on natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant when integrated with carbon capture plant (CCP) and lower the capital expenditure (CapEX) associated with carbon capture. The conventional approach of providing steam to the carbon capture reboiler for CO2 regeneration is the use of a bolt-on system, which entails an external auxiliary boiler. The study presented four promising technologies that can enhance the integration of NGCC with CCP: steam integration, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), gas turbine improvement, and enhanced control system. The paper analyzes how EGR can decrease CCP CapEX and footprint, focusing on equipment with the most significant CapEX reductions. The steam integration approach refers to extracting steam from various locations in the steam cycle such as the crossover between the intermediate pressure (IP) and low pressure (LP) sections of the steam turbine using a throttle and control valve. The EGR method refers to recirculating a part of the flue gas from the stack back into the gas turbine inlet, where it is combined with ambient air. The analysis reveals that EGR contributes to an increase in the concentration of CO2 in exhaust while simultaneously decreasing the amount of flue gas directed to the CCP. This dual effect is expected to result in a reduction in both the overall CCP CapEX and its footprint. The study delves into the impact of EGR return temperature and EGR ratio on the output of gas turbine and combined cycle systems. NGCC performance has been evaluated utilizing GE’s internal mass and heat balance tools. CCP performance and cost were assessed using commercial tools ProMax and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. The study demonstrates that providing steam to CCP through a steam integration solution is more effective than using a bolt-on solution. The steam integration solution has a potential to achieve up to 30% decrease in CCP CapEX compared to the bolt-on solution utilizing an auxiliary boiler. In addition, using a 30% EGR in the steam integration solution decreases the CapEx for the CCP by an additional 7%. EGR return temperatures ranging from 27°C to 44°C at 1°C intervals are considered, alongside studied EGR ratios of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. The analysis demonstrates that the output of the studied NGCC increases at all studied EGR return temperatures and EGR ratios, reaching a peak at a 35% EGR ratio before leveling off.

Cannabigerol’s (CBG) therapeutic effects are limited by its poor water solubility and low dissolution rate. To improve these properties, supercritical CO2-assisted atomization (SAA) was applied to produce coprecipitates, i.e., CBG nanoparticles coprecipitated in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) microparticles. The experiments were performed by varying the CBG/PVP mass ratio (R) and the overall concentration of solutes CBG+PVP to study the influence of these parameters on particle morphology, particle size, and size distribution. Periodic dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was performed at regular time intervals to measure the size of CBG nanoparticles in PVP microparticles. It showed that CBG nanoparticles down to 105 nm were successfully produced through SAA. Dissolution tests were used to verify that a reduction of CBG particle size significantly increased its dissolution rate. In the liquid medium adopted, untreated CBG powder was released in 210 min, whereas CBG nanoparticles of 105 nm were completely dissolved in only 15 min.

Abstract The increasing commitment to sustainable practices has intensified research into innovative methods to diminish the release of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases, such as CO2, CO, and NOx, into our environment. A promising avenue of exploration lies in the adoption of fuel emulsions enriched with nano-additives aimed at curtailing NOx emissions. In this context, our study delves into the impact of nano-particulate additives — specifically those based on ammonia and water — on the combustion characteristics of Jet-A1 aviation fuel. Utilizing a 300-kW liquid swirl combustor, we conducted a series of experiments across two global equivalence ratios (Φ = 0.24 and Φ = 0.40). Our investigation encompassed the analysis of laminar flame speed (LFS) and an in-depth examination of flame properties through advanced chemiluminescence imaging and modal analysis techniques. The primary objective was to unravel the complexities of how these nano-additives modulate flame dynamics and the intricate web of internal chemical reactions, alongside evaluating the broader environmental ramifications resulting from alterations in the combustion process. The experimental outcomes revealed that the integration of urea and water additives into the fuel matrix distinctly affected LFS, with observed enhancements at the lower global equivalence ratio and detrimental impacts when the ratio was increased. Through modal analysis, we discerned a notable stabilizing influence on the flame’s behavior, which was particularly pronounced at leaner fuel conditions. From the study of the spray, the addition of water and urea appears to influence combustion chemistry, and more uniform sprays facilitate more complete combustion. Chemiluminescence imaging further illuminated these effects, demonstrating a higher emission intensity of NH2* radicals compared to NH* radicals, a variance contingent on the global equivalence ratio. Notably, the experimental data indicated a substantial abatement in NOx emissions, predominantly at the lower equivalence ratios. This reduction was accompanied by a marginal uptick in CO2 and CO emissions — a trade-off that warrants consideration.

Abstract BACKGROUND This study explored the mechanism of irrigation and nitrogen (N) coupling on spring maize yield and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with the objective of achieving water saving, high yield and emission reduction. Field experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of multiple irrigation and N management strategies on GHG emissions and to determine the optimal balance between GHG, water conservation and grain yield. The experiments were conducted on spring maize with three irrigation levels (low, IL; medium, IM; and high, IH) and 4 N application levels (N40, N80, N120 and N160 kg N ha −1 ). RESULTS The IL treatment exhibited the lowest N 2 O and CO 2 emission fluxes and the lowest CH 4 uptake fluxes. The N40 treatment exhibited the lowest N 2 O and CO 2 emission fluxes and the highest CH 4 uptake flux. Significant positive correlations were observed among N 2 O and CO 2 emission fluxes, CH 4 uptake fluxes, and soil moisture and inorganic N content. Maize yield initially increased and then decreased with rising levels of irrigation and N management. By employing the TOPSIS method to assess yield and greenhouse effects, we identified the IMN120 treatment as optimal given that this treatment achieved the highest yield (14 686.26 kg ha −1 ) and water use efficiency (3.51 kg m −3 ) while maintaining relatively low global warming potential (573.30 kg CO2 eq ∙ ha −1 ) and GHG intensity (0.0390 kg CO2 eq ∙ kg −1 ). CONCLUSION Irrigation optimization and N management are key to reducing GHG emissions, enhancing yield, and promoting both the sustainable development of agriculture and environmental protection. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

Highly sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors for trace carcinogens, such as heavy metal chromium(VI) [Cr(VI)] and antibiotic tetracycline (TC) are crucial. Herein, by integration of photoactive and redox phosphomolybdates with conjugated organic components, types of dual-mode PEC sensors were synthesized for sensing trace Cr(VI) and TC pollutants, with formulas of (H2bimb)2[Co2(bimb)1.5][Co(H2O)4][Co(P4Mo6O31H6)2]·6H2O (1), (H2bib)2[Co(H2O)3][Co2(H2O)5][Co(P4Mo6O31H6)2]·9H2O (2), and (H2bib)6[Co(Hbib)2(H2O)5][Co(P4Mo6O31H7)2]2·15H2O (3), where bimb represents 1,4-bis(1-imidazolyl)benzene and bib is 4,4′-bis(imidazolyl)bibphenyl. Hybrid 1 consisted of a three-dimensional framework structure constructed by Co{P4Mo6}2 clusters and one-dimensional (1D) {Co-bimb} chains, hybrid 2 exhibited 1D Co ion-bridged Co{P4Mo6}2 chains hydrogen-bonding with [H2bib]2+ cations, and hybrid 3 showed a discrete hybrid structure built upon a Co{P4Mo6}2 cluster modified by the {Co-bib} unit. Hybrids 1–3 displayed wide spectral absorption and excellent electrochemical redox properties, enabling dual-mode PEC responses to Cr(VI) reduction and TC oxidation. For Cr(VI) detection, hybrids 1–3 exhibited high sensitivities of 364.40, 225.72, and 124.29 μA·μM–1 as well as "nM" level detection limits (LODs) of 4.9, 10.0, and 11.0 nM, respectively. For TC detection, the sensitivities of hybrids 1–3 were 494.72, 308.78, and 174.03 μA·μM–1 and the LODs were 5.2, 6.1, and 12.9 nM, respectively. This research offers significant insights into designing efficient PEC sensors for the detection of environmental pollutants.

Methane is the second largest contributor to global surface air temperature rise. Reducing atmospheric methane will mitigate climate change and improve air quality. Since the main sink of methane is the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the atmosphere, increasing OH concentration will accelerate the methane oxidation process and reduce methane concentration. Because the primary source of OH is the reaction between water vapor and ozone, scientists have proposed a water vapor enhancement strategy to raise OH concentrations in the atmosphere and remove methane. We use a two-box model to evaluate interactions between OH and methane and a radiative kernel method to calculate radiative responses to water vapor content growth. This proves that increasing OH concentration does have a positive effect on methane reduction. If the concentration of OH is increased by 10% from its current value and maintained for 50 (100) years, 45 Tg yr−1 (67.5 Tg yr−1) more methane will be oxidized by OH, and the cumulative effects of the oxidation are equivalent to a 120.5 Gt (219.6 Gt) reduction in CO2 and will lower the global surface air temperature by 0.054 °C (0.099 °C). Our study also provides insights into a mixed picture of global and regional radiative responses to the growth of water vapor content. The reduced radiative forcing by methane removal cannot overpower the increased radiative forcing by water vapor from the global average point of view. However, due to OH’s greater sensitivity to water vapor and weaker radiative response at higher latitudes, this perspective may be reversed if abrupt CH4 emissions from permafrost thaw occur.

Abstract The challenges of climate change have led to an increased commitment from both industry and government to environmentally friendly technologies. In the aviation industry, goals of CO2 and NOx reduction were implemented in the Flightpath 2050. One way to reach this goal is by using alternative propulsion systems, such as fuel cells. The ecologic feasibility of the hydrogen fuel cell depends heavily on its performance which in turn is largely determined by the power to weight ratio as well as the volumetric flows of reactants conveyed within the cell. In this context, a key component for the performance is the bipolar plate (BPP), as its channel geometry defines the volumetric flows of reactants. To reduce the mass of the bipolar plate, lightweight materials such as titanium are used. This on the other hand leads to challenges in the forming of BPP regarding its quality and safety due to its material properties. In this paper, three different manufacturing methods are investigated numerically regarding their feasibility for the use in bipolar plate manufacturing for the aviation industry. To evaluate the suitability of the regarded manufacturing processes, the results are compared in terms of shape accuracy, material thinning as well as stress states. The three-dimensional simulations showed that hydroforming leads to the highest material thinning compared to rubber pad forming and embossing. The shape accuracy was the highest for rubber pad forming, while the stress states varied just marginal.

Mechanical air conditioning systems have a significant share of energy consumption in the building sector. Passive solar systems, such as solar chimneys, can reduce building energy demand by supplying space heating, cooling, and ventilation, significantly decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the heating and ventilation efficiencies of a solar chimney integrated system, including a roof solar chimney coupled with an air channel, for a two-story office building in Tehran, Iran. The studied system's conditions are switchable from heating to cooling by changing the opening positions. Computational Fluid Dynamics was employed to numerically investigate the heating and ventilation efficiencies of the proposed solar system. The results confirmed that the system could be utilized for pre-heating purposes during working hours but that the building should be ventilated only for 35% of this time with an air change rate of 0.8 during the year's coldest month. The arrangement could provide thermal and ventilation comfort for the occupied space only at solar intensity and ambient temperature higher than 550 W/m2 and 10 °C, respectively. In addition, the solar system could reduce 32% of the annual heating demand (918 kWh), which is equal to a reduction of 1865 kg of CO2 emissions during working hours.

Indoor air quality (IAQ) has a significant impact on human health, as people spend 90% of their time in various indoor environments. Therefore, research on IAQ is extremely necessary. However, current research on traditional Qiang residences in western Sichuan mainly focuses on the indoor thermal environment and heritage protection, with relatively little attention paid to IAQ. This study investigates the IAQ of traditional Qiang residences in western Sichuan, which have open fire pits as the core of daily life, exploring the impact of passive renovation strategies on the indoor air quality. Using simulation methods, this study employs passive strategies, such as increasing the size of windward windows, changing ventilation methods, relocating the fire pit, and enlarging interior partition openings, to improve and optimize the IAQ through natural ventilation. The results show that when the windward window sizes are 0.8 m × 1.9 m and 0.7 m × 1.55 m, the reduction in the indoor CO2 concentration is the greatest, with a maximum decrease of 0.024% at the 1.5 m plane. This paper proposes passive renovation strategies to improve the indoor air quality of Qiang residences in western Sichuan. These strategies effectively enhance the indoor air quality of Qiang residences and address the research gap on indoor air quality in regional Qiang residences in western Sichuan. The insights and methods presented contribute to the improvement of the indoor air quality in traditional buildings and support the sustainable development of traditional architecture.

The multi‐carbon (C2+) alcohols produced by electrochemical CO2 reduction, such as ethanol and n‐propanol, are considered as indispensable liquid energy carriers. In most C–C coupling cases, however, the concomitant gaseous C2H4 product results in the low selectivity of C2+ alcohols. Here, we report rational construction of mesostructured CuO electrocatalysts, specifically mesoporous CuO (m‐CuO) and cylindrical CuO (c‐CuO), enables selective distribution of C2+ products. The m‐CuO and c‐CuO showed similar selectivity towards total C2+ products (≥76%), but the corresponding predominant products were C2+ alcohols (55%) and C2H4 (52%), respectively. The ordered mesostructure not only induced the surface hydrophobicity, but selectively tailored the adsorption configuration of *CO intermediate: m‐CuO preferred bridged adsorption, whereas c‐CuO favored top adsorption as revealed by in situ spectroscopies. Computational calculations unraveled that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo the favorable conventional C–C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.

A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted for 36 days to study the effect of pigeon pea biochar (PPB) and wood biochar (WB) on carbon mineralization of native soil organic carbon (SOC) and municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) applied to soil. The MSWC addition enhanced soil respiration by 2-fold (231 mg C kg-1 soil) over the control (118 mg C kg-1 soil). The PPB addition significantly (P < 0.05) increased cumulative loss of carbon as CO2, whereas WB significantly decreased the cumulative loss of C over control. Addition of PPB at 5% and 10% levels increased SOC mineralization (positive priming) +22.9% and +31.2%, respectively; whereas reduction in SOC mineralization (negative priming) was noticed in WB (5% and 10%) treated soils by -3.1% and -21.7%, respectively. Similarly, WB induced strong negative priming effects (-21.9% and -29.5%), while PPB caused a weak positive priming effect (+3.0% and +11.6%) at 5% and 10% levels on mineralization of added labile carbon substrate (MSWC), respectively. Results indicate the hardwood (Prosopis juliflora) biochar exhibits refractory properties that inhibit mineralization of both native SOC and applied organic compost (MSWC), and thereby it can be used as an amendment to stabilize native and applied organic matter in soil, which may significantly contribute to soil carbon sequestration.

A water diversion system (WDS) with cascade pumping stations (CPSs) plays an important role in the application of water resources. However, high energy consumption is reported due to unreasonable scheduling schemes and long decision times. Herein, this paper presents a new method to achieve optimal scheduling schemes effectively, including the head allocation of CPSs, the number of running pumps, and pump blade angles. A double-layer mathematical model for a WDS was established with the goal of achieving minimal energy consumption, considering the constraints of flow rate, water level, and the characteristics of pump units. The inner-layer model was used to obtain scheduling schemes of single-stage pumping stations, as well as the water levels and flow rates of water channels, while the outer-layer model was used to optimize inter-stage head allocation. An improved wolf-pack algorithm (IWPA) was proposed to solve the model, using a Halton sequence to obtain the uniform initial population distribution and introducing simulated annealing (SA) to improve the global searchability. Moreover, an idea for a pre-established scheme library was suggested for inner-layer models to obtain the solutions in real time with less calculation workload. Taking an actual project as a case, in contrast with the actual schemes, the optimal scheduling method could result in energy savings of 14.37–20.39%, a CO2 emission reduction of 13–32 tons per day, and water savings of 0.14–18.34%. Moreover, the time complexity decreased to square order, and the CPU time of the optimal method was about 1% that of the traditional method. This study provides an efficient method for the high-value utilization of energy and water resources for a WDS.

Abstract In the search for alternative aviation fuels, ammonia shows much promise. The higher density and boiling point of ammonia compared to hydrogen could mean ammonia could be used without a dramatic rethinking of aircraft architecture. Instead, the possibility exists that current aircraft and engines could be retrofitted to use ammonia instead of traditional jet fuel. This paper aims to address the engine aspect of such a retrofit. The open-source Toolbox for Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS) is modified to allow for the modeling of ammonia fueled engines and the addition of heat exchangers and other technologies. A thermodynamic cycle model of a baseline ammonia engine is created retaining the turbomachinery maps, duct sizes, nozzle areas, and bleed flow rates from a kerosene engine. This engine is then modified by adding heat exchangers and a supercritical CO2 waste heat recovery (WHR) cycle to produce power for the engine and aid in the preheating of the ammonia. Preliminary analysis is performed to determine the ideal location of heat exchangers to benefit cycle efficiency. This analysis suggests that using the ammonia as a heat sink to intercool and recuperate the engine allows for significant improvements over baseline performance. From there, optimization of the geometry of the added heat exchangers is performed to limit heat exchanger size and minimize engine fuel consumption at cruise. The addition of these heat exchangers allows for a reduction in fuel burn of 3%–9% over the baseline engine. Additionally, the WHR cycle can produce the required 250 horsepower (186 kW) of electrical power for the aircraft and the ammonia temperature is increased from 420°R to over 1400°R (233K to 778K). Investigating the results of the optimization shows that making more substantial changes to engines could allow for further improvements to engine performance past that of a retrofit.

This study establishes a life cycle assessment model to quantitively evaluate and predict material resource consumption, fossil energy consumption and environmental emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) by employing the GaBi software. This study distinguishes the environmental impact of different vehicle working conditions, power battery degradation scenarios, and mileage scenarios on the operation and use stages of PHEVs, BEVs, and HEVs. The findings indicate that under urban, highway, and aggressive driving conditions, PHEVs’ life cycle material resource and fossil fuel consumption exceed that of BEVs but are less than HEVs. Battery degradation leads to increased material resource consumption, energy use, and environmental emissions for both PHEVs and BEVs. When the power battery degrades to 85%, the material resource and fossil energy consumption during the operation and use phase increases by 51.43%, 72.68% for BEVs and 29.37%, 36.21% for PHEVs compared with no degradation, respectively, indicating that the environmental impact of BEVs are more sensitive than those of PHEVs to the impact of power battery degradation. Among different mileage scenarios, PHEVs demonstrate the lowest sensitivity to increased mileage regarding life cycle material resource consumption, with the smallest increase. Future projections for 2025 and 2035 suggest life cycle GWP of HEV, PHEV and BEV in 2035 is 1.21 × 104, 1.12 × 104 and 1.01 × 104 kg CO2-eq, respectively, which shows reductions of 48.7%, 30.9% and 36.1% compared with those in 2025. The outcomes of this study are intended to bolster data support for the manufacturing and development of PHEV, BEV and HEV under different scenarios and offer insights into the growth and technological progression of the automotive sector.

Most state-of-the-art electric space propulsion systems, such as gridded and Hall effect thrusters, use xenon as the propellant gas. However, xenon is very rare and expensive to produce, and it is used in a number of competing industrial applications. Iodine is emerging as an attractive alternative to xenon in several electric propulsion technologies. Its lower cost and larger availability, solid state at standard temperature and pressure, its low vapor pressure and its low ionization potential make it an attractive option. Attempts to implement an alternative to xenon propellants (Iodine, O2 , N2 , H2 , CO2 etc) in conventional propulsion systems have been met with measured success. However, the use of chemically reactive species, such as O2, H2, or iodine, requires the chosen propulsion platform to be chemically compatible with the propellant. Significant reductions in the operational lifetime of the thruster because of chemical incompatibility negates any potential increase in thruster performance or propellant availability. Thus, careful material selection for the electric propulsion system itself and for the components employed on the satellite is required in the light of a typical space mission duration of several years. Due to the more complex reaction processes and energy loss channels in iodine plasma´s however, as well as the historical lack of reliable collision cross-section data, the development of accurate theoretical and numerical models has been hindered. The development of techniques that can be applied to chemically dissimilar propellants, focusing on electromagnetic behaviour, would represent a significant improvement in the state of discharge characterization and thruster analysis. In this work, we conducted a comparative analysis of the existing modeling results for various types of electric propulsion using iodine as a propellant gas, as well as the results of experiments with iodine plasma with an emphasis on the thrust-to-power ratio.

Abstract The estimation of a flame transfer function (FTF)from time series data generated by large eddy simulation (LES) via system identification (SI) is an established and important element of thermoacoustic analysis. To achieve results with low uncertainties, continuous (non-truncated) time series of adequate length are required. This can be a challenge in the case of turbulent flames, where signal-to-noise ratio may be low. Because LES codes do not scale to an arbitrarily high degree of parallelism, the wall-clock-time required for confident FTF estimation may be excessive. The present paper tackles this challenge by exploiting characteristic features of linear time-invariant systems. Specifically, we explore how the superposition of multiple simulations with the same excitation signal, but varying initial conditions, increases signal-to-noise ratio and leads to more robust identification, i.e. estimates with narrow confidence intervals. In addition, the established SI approach, which relies on broadband excitation, is compared to excitation with approximate Dirac and Heaviside signals, with the advantage of simpler pre- and post-processing. Results demonstrate that the proposed workflow, which is inherently parallel because it is based on superposition, reduces significantly the wall-clock-time required for robust FTF identification in the case of broadband excitation. This reduction in wall-clock-time requires more simultaneous simulation runs, i.e. more parallel computational resources, but it does not significantly increase the overall computational cost. Furthermore, the new workflow facilitates FTF estimation when exciting with a Heaviside signal. The proposed method is assessed for the case of a partially premixed, steam enriched (“WET”) swirl burner with significant turbulent noise levels. Steam enrichment is a combustion concept that reduces harmful emissions such as NOx and CO2 while increasing engine efficiency. However, the effect of steam on the flame response, i.e. the FTF, needs to be better understood. To this end, a combustion model that includes an optimized global chemical mechanism for partially premixed wet methane combustion, has been formulated and validated against experimental data.

Operating the pressurized catalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction is promising for industrial applications; however, two of the most challenging problems are serious coke deposition and metal sintering, especially under high temperature. Designing a catalyst with a small metal particle size, strong metal–support interaction (MSI), high migration rate of oxygen species, and moderate basicity can be effective to solve these problems. In this work, we prepared Ce and La promoted Co/C catalysts and compared their structural properties, catalytic activity, and stability with Co/C. The results show that 4 wt % Ce promoted Co/C (Co-4Ce/C) exhibits a small average metal particle size of 3.87 nm, larger specific surface area (396 m2/g), stronger MSI, higher reduction degree of active metal, larger content of surface chemical adsorbed oxygen, and medium basicity (0.286 mmol/g), providing better catalytic performance with stable CH4 conversion, CO2 conversion, and H2/CO ratio values of 78.0%, 85.8% and 0.77, respectively, for 100 h of reaction under 800 °C, 0.5 MPa, and 30,000 mL·gcat–1·h–1. Only a slight increase of metal particle size as well as a lower amount of deposited carbon were observed on the reacted catalyst, well explaining its good stability. Moreover, the carbon nanotube structure was detected on the surface of Co-4Ce/C, indicating the formation of a kind of more stable carbon-based catalyst. At last, a bifunctional activation mechanism was proposed based on the analysis of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, which can illustrate the shorter induction period and its enhanced activity. Overall, the Co-4Ce/C exhibits excellent resistance of metal sintering and carbon deposition and would be attractive for the catalytic DRM reaction, especially under an elevated pressure.

The current study examines the efficiency and environmental impact of a diesel engine running on neem oil biodiesel mixed with nano additions, notably Manganese oxide (MnO) and Ferric chloride (FeCl3). The study seeks to tackle the urgent problem of pollutant emissions, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx), from internal combustion engines. Biodiesel, sourced from renewable substances such as neem oil, offers a possible substitute for traditional diesel fuel. Nevertheless, the general use of this technology is impeded by difficulties such as increased NOx emissions and fuel volatility. In order to address these difficulties, this study investigates the application of nano additives to improve the efficiency of combustion and decrease emissions. Various fuel blends, such as pure diesel, neem oil biodiesel (B25), and blends of B25 with MnO and FeCl3, were used in experimental experiments. An ultrasonic aspirator was used to include 100 parts per million (ppm) of each nano ingredient into the B20 blend. The performance metrics, including engine efficiency, power output, and emissions levels of NOx, CO, HC, CO2, and particulate matter, were assessed and compared to the standard diesel fuel. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of nano additives enhances the combustion properties, resulting in decreased emissions, specifically NOx. The Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) increased for the nano-blended test fuels compared to diesel, resulting in a reduction in Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC). The BTE (Brake Thermal Efficiency) level reaches its peak when the engine is operating at maximum load using the B25 + MnO and B25 + FeCl3 fuel blend. The emissions of gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), smoke, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in nano mixed fuels are significantly lower than those produced by diesel fuel operation. The B25 + FeCl3 fuel mix has a higher emission of hydrocarbon (HC) content compared to other nano-blended fuels, but it emits less HC content than diesel fuel. The diesel and biodiesel test fuels exhibit optimal performance under load conditions of up to 50%. Diesel, B25 mix, B25 + MnO, and B25 + FeCl3 had carbon monoxide (CO) emissions ranging from 0.045 to 0.050%, whilst the other two test fuels have emissions ranging from 0.029 to 0.035%. Under a load condition of 50%, the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions for the fuel blends B25 + MnO and B25 + FeCl3 vary between 0.001% and 0.011%. The cylinder pressure and heat release rates are marginally elevated compared to those of the diesel fuel. The findings indicated that neem oil biodiesel with nano additions has the potential to be a feasible and eco-friendly substitute fuel for diesel engines.

The purpose of this study is reducing sustainable paper recycling at Thi-Qar University by using waste reduction techniques.It can be argued with much confidence that the idea of recycling paper can be successfully implemented in an academic institution.This can be done by merging the specific waste paper baskets, pulping machine and power from a renewable source with an already established local paper making company.The methods applied in this study are making company would be able to recoup a government subsidy that pays them to recycle paper in order to offset the cost of pulped paper which is 30% more expensive than raw wood pulp.The academic institution that implements this would save money on waste disposal, and cut its carbon footprint in half, by up to 600%, per year approximately five-six tons of CO2 instead of one-ton-two tones carbon offset for simply recycling the paper.All these steps could also be applied for recycling of the large amount of waste papers generated by students an idea that encounters high costs in recycling hence being rarely implemented.This could be achieved through urged use of the same paper disposal methods already in use, where the paper collected is pulped from the student paper waste bins once a week.The results of this article are more specific yet indirect environmental benefit concerns the recycling habits of students.By providing the means for students to recycle paper at their places of study, it is hoped that they will adopt similar practices in their homes and other areas of life and show that the practice of paper recycling at Thi-Qar University has a success rate of 98.42%.Additionally, a total revenue of $3,527.98 was collected from the value of recycled paper.This can be important, as it is today's young people who will shape the future condition of the environment.If a more conscientious attitude towards recycling can be established, the cumulative environmental benefits could be very significant.On the economic side, recycling paper can potentially save academic institutions a substantial amount of money on their waste disposal.This is because paper and cardboard often make up a high percentage of the waste and these are materials which can be recycled relatively cheaply.By decreasing the volume of general waste, a decrease in waste disposal costs can be achieved.If institutions take it a step further and decide to purchase only recycled paper products, this can also help accelerate the demand for recycled paper and its long-term economic feasibility.The benefits of paper recycling in academic institutions are undoubtedly far-reaching.Not only are the environmental benefits significant, but also the potential cost savings and impact on student attitudes.Probably the most apparent benefits of paper recycling are the environmental ones.The significance of this research is recycling paper in academic institutions is not only beneficial to the environment but also has potential cost-saving implications and significant educational value for students' attitudes.

Regarding the mineralogy and iron formations, where the total iron content can be up to 40 wt.% [2], the Fe is composed of carbonates, silicates, sulfides, and hydroxide, commonly occurring in variable combinations. The presence of carbonates in Earth's interior is related to the subduction process, one of the first steps in cycling carbon throughout Earth [3]. Carbonate minerals are important constituents of many rock types and are represented by CaCO3 (calcite), MgCO3 (magnesite), and FeCO3 (siderite). Siderite has attracted considerable attention as this mineral is related to CO2 capture [4,5], a natural protection against corrosion [6,7], a source of iron ore [8,9], and much more. The thermal decomposition of siderite is significant because of the industrial relevance of this mineral [10,11]. The mechanism of this process depends on the siderite composition and experimental conditions like temperature, atmosphere, annealing time, or sample microstructure. The process of the thermal decomposition of siderite [12,13] and the products of this transformation under various external conditions are relatively well described. However, most of the research focuses on the final product of siderite decomposition, and such research is usually conducted in air. In this work, we aim to show not only what the final product of the decomposition of this iron carbonate is but also how exactly this process proceeds as the temperature increases. Moreover, in our research, we pay particular attention to the influence of time on the sider decomposition process and the atmosphere in which the investigated sample is located (air or vacuum).The siderite high-temperature decomposition and products of this process in air and a vacuum atmosphere were characterized using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. In this method, the Fe nucleus was treated as a probe of its local surroundings. Based on the results of this method, we obtained information about the iron oxidation states, the iron local microenvironments, the iron magnetic states, and the relative fractions of the iron-bearing components [14]. This study has profound implications for processing siderite ore through metallurgy and ore dressing. The Mössbauer investigation was supported by the X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence methods.Various carbonate rocks are present in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland. These are mainly siderites in the form of spherosiderites, shoal siderites, and carbonaceous siderites. The studied siderites come from the Ruda coal seams' upper parts, in the Chwałowice Trough's eastern part, in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. The research was carried out on two rock samples taken from different seams. These samples were designated Sd1 and Sd3. The siderite samples were heated in air and a vacuum from room temperature to 700 °C for one hour. After heating at a given temperature, the Mössbauer measurements and, for selected samples, XRD measurements were performed.The measurements by XRD revealed that the rock siderite samples contained siderite as the main component and small amounts of accessory minerals. The Sd1 sample contained ~94% siderite and 5% kaolinite. However, the Sd3 sample contained 84% siderite, and the remainder was mainly kaolinite (6%) and quartz (7%). Moreover, the Sd1 sample contained 37% Fe and 1% Mg, and the Sd3 sample contained slightly less, 28% Fe, but much more magnesium, as much as 4%. The only and main phase containing Fe was siderite, which makes 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy an excellent tool for studying the processes it undergoes during annealing. Figure 1 shows the selected Mössbauer spectra for the Sd1 sample heated for one hour at defined temperatures, in air and in a vacuum.The results show that the time and the type of atmosphere influence the siderite decomposition process. Regardless of these factors, the process occurs in the temperature range of 300–400 °C. However, the longer the heating time, the faster the siderite decomposition process begins, and its products are iron oxides (hematite and magnetite).
