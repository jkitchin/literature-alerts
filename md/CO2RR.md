Since carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased at unprecedented rate over the last ten years, global warming has become an increasingly pressing concern for humanity. This work suggests a sustainable solution to this issue by employing a unique mechanism that uses sunlight and electricity to transform CO2 into useful fuel. To construct the device, a Simulink model of the electrochemical reduction cell was created. The model essentially transforms photovoltaic power, CO2 and water into other chemical products. Using the reversible, activation and ohmic equations, the voltage needed to run the CO2 reduction cell was determined. As the anode, cathode, and voltage source blocks are the three main models that make up the CO2 electrolyser cell, the production flow rates of formic acid and oxygen were also evaluated based on molar and charge balances, as well as continuity equations at operating conditions of 1 atm and 298 K. The simulation predicts about 176 kg of CO2 consumption in 10 seconds of the electrochemical conversion. Therefore, the implication of this study is to justify photosynthesis as electrochemical reduction process to efficiently mitigate the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.

The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) into high-value-added products is considered to be a promising way to mitigate carbon emissions. However, it remains a challenge to design an efficient catalyst with an excellent performance. In this work, we synthesized a metal azole framework (MAF) by changing 2-methylimidazole ligands into 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole (MMT) for use as organic linkers and mercaptan groups as anchoring sites for the Ag nanoparticles. The Ag NPs@ MAF-MMT material displayed a wide potential window from −0.6 to −1.2 V vs. RHE, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) over 90.5%, and a current density of 18 mA cm−2 at −1.1 V vs. RHE for 11 h in an H-cell. This work provides a new option to immobilize Ag nanoparticles in MAFs material for the exploration of carbon dioxide reduction catalysts.

Utilizing sunlight for photoelectrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (PEC CO2 RR) is a carbon-neutral path to valuable liquid fuels. Higher quality photoabsorbers are needed to improve the efficiency of the PEC CO2 RR process. We show how the optoelectronic properties of sputtered ZnTe absorbers can be improved for this purpose via chloride treatments. MnCl2 and MgCl2 heat treatments recrystallize ZnTe absorbers to enlarge grains and improve photoluminescence. These material improvements result in the highest PEC CO2 RR photocurrent density reported for planar ZnTe and >50% Faradaic efficiency to CO formation with diaryliodonium additive in the solution. These results pave the way to integration of polycrystalline thin-film photoabsorbers in PEC CO2 RR systems.

Human (anthropogenic) influence, mostly generalized industry, intensive conventional agriculture, traffic and others, causes the increase of concentration of greenhouse gases to a level by which significantly more heat is radiated back to the earth than it was in the initial state. This is how climate warming occurs. At the international level, periodic inventories are carried out that show the fact that the biosphere absorbs, approximately, half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and at the terrestrial level, the carbon source and reserve is given by the northern hemisphere.This study presents some results from the literature regarding the methods of C emissions reduction and its sequestration per surface unit, i.e. per hectare of agricultural crops, to increase the contribution of agriculture to environmental depollution. The used methods included searching of databases, such as Web of Science or Google Scholar, in order to identify some relevant results.Reducing CO2 emissions can be achieved through biological, chemical and technological options, either by reducing or sequestering them.

Metal nanocatalysts supported on oxide scaffolds have been widely used in energy storage and conversion reactions. So far, the main research is still focused on the growth, density, size, and activity enhancement of exsolved nanoparticles (NPs). However, the lack of precise regulation of the type and composition of NPs elements under reduction conditions has restricted the architectural development of in situ exsolution systems. Herein, we propose a strategy to attain a regulated distribution of exsolved transition metals (Cu, Ni, and Fe) on Sr2Fe1.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Mo0.4O6–δ medium-entropy perovskite oxides by varying the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) gradient in the mixture. At 800 °C, the unitary Cu, binary Cu–Ni, and ternary Cu–Ni–Fe NPs are exsolved as pO2 decreases from high to low. Combining experimental and theoretical simulations, we further corroborate that solid oxide electrolysis cells with ternary alloy clusters at the CNF@SFO interface exhibit superior CO2 electrolytic performance. Our results provide tailored strategies for nanostructures and nanointerfaces for studying metal oxide exsolution systems, including fuel electrode materials.    

    

## CO2 Reduction at a Borane‐Modified Iron Complex: A Secondary Coordination Sphere Strategy

This work addresses fundamental questions that deepen our understanding of secondary coordination sphere effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using derivatized hydride analogues of the type, [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H] (Cp* = C5Me5‐) – a well‐studied family of organometallic complex – as models. More precisely, we describe the general reactivity of [(Cp*‐BR2)Fe(diphosphine)H], which contains an intramolecularly positioned Lewis acid, and its cooperative reactivity with CO2. Control experiments underscore the critical nature of borane incorporation for CO2 to reduced products, a reaction that does not occur for unfunctionalized [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H]). Additional experiments highlight relevance of borane hybridization and substituent effects. Mechanistic studies performed in the presence and absence of CO2 emphasize the significance of carbonyl substrate to catalyst longevity. Lessons from these reactions were also transferable – with such borane‐containing complexes enabling the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes in the presence of alkenes. These findings provide valuable insights into metal‐ligand cooperative design strategies for carbonyl reduction and illustrate the versatility of intramolecularly positioned Lewis acids for otherwise challenging chemical transformations.

The article explores the potential of CO2 injection technology for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and simultaneous reduction of carbon emissions through storage in oil reservoirs and aquifers. The study focuses on 23 oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, identified as promising candidates for implementing this technology. The model used in the research assesses the economic and technical feasibility of CO2 injection, along with the integration of EOR and long-term carbon storage. The primary goal is to demonstrate that injecting 70 million tons of CO2 annually over 40 years can result in an additional oil recovery of 5.9%-7.6% of the original oil in place, equivalent to 276-351 million cubic meters. Excess CO2 can be stored in aquifers, further contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions. The article outlines key aspects of the study, including economic and technical parameters, such as costs associated with CO2 transportation, storage, and drilling of new wells, as well as various oil and CO2 price scenarios. The environmental benefits of the project are highlighted, showing that the significant CO2 retained in oil reservoirs and aquifers compensates for emissions from the combustion of recovered oil. The study also discusses the features of the model, including scenarios for continuous CO2 injection and considerations of infrastructure costs. The article emphasizes the importance of developing and implementing such projects in the context of global climate change mitigation efforts and points to the significant potential of CO2 injection technology for the oil industry. The aim of this article is to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of large-scale CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and long-term carbon storage in oil fields and aquifers. The study seeks to demonstrate how CO2 injection can increase oil recovery rates while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions, providing a comprehensive technical-economic assessment of the process. Through the analysis of 23 oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the article aims to present the economic, environmental, and operational advantages of integrating CO2 storage with EOR operations.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) has historically been the primary focus of carbon management programs and portfolios driven by increasing atmospheric levels that reached approximately 36.8 billion tonnes in 2022, which amounted to a 0.9% increase over the previous year. Early carbon management efforts concentrated largely on large point sources like the fossil energy power generation sector, primarily coal. More recently, the scope has broadened to include natural gas power generation and the more challenging-to-address industrial sector. Over the past five years, there has been a notable effort to address the latter harder-to-abate industrial and commercial sectors through carbon dioxide reduction (CDR). Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that establishing a compelling business case is essential to enable widespread implementation to meet the climate change targets of 1.5°C or 2°C scenarios. Methane (CH4) has been regarded as the transition fossil fuel alternative to coal for over a decade due to its low carbon intensity, abundance, worldwide portability, and potential to be integrated into existing point source facilities. Among the various greenhouse gases, some with higher global warming potential, CH4 is the one carbon-based species that has the inherent potential to be the most impactful for tackling climate change while also having the potential of no net cost since captured emissions can offset the cost of abatement. The global priority of addressing methane emissions is underscored by the Global Methane Pledge that originated at COP26 and was expanded at COP28. The importance of reducing methane emissions was demonstrated by The White House Office of Domestic Policy's U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan and Executive Order 14057 to lead the Federal Government to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050. The US Department of Energy (DOE) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have jointly undertaken measures to address methane emissions.The mission of the DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) is to minimize the environmental and climate impacts of fossil fuels and industrial processes while working toward net-zero emissions. FECM collaborates closely with the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) whose mission is to drive innovation and deliver solutions for an environmentally sustainable and prosperous future. Collectively FECM and NETL have been at the forefront of carbon management research for the past three decades through programs that support research, development, demonstration, and deployment to advance technologies that reduce emissions and other environmental impacts of fossil fuels and industrial production. FECM and NETL leverage their well-established core competencies to lead comprehensive programs focused on carbon dioxide (CO2) management, including point source carbon capture, carbon dioxide removal, and carbon storage, abatement of methane emissions, including methane mitigation technologies, and natural gas decarbonization hydrogen technologies to accelerate the development of a carbon-free power sector by 2035 and a "net-zero" carbon economy by 2050.To meet a 1.5ºC scenario, it is imperative to implement a wide range of carbon management strategies encompassing both carbon capture and methane emissions abatement. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), giving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to award grants for financial and technical assistance for activities including the reduction of methane and other GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems and infrastructure. In late 2023, the EPA partnered with NETL to provide technical support, along with program and project management expertise, to provide technical expertise and implement a program strategy to invest over $1 billion to measure and mitigate methane emissions. Currently, FECM and NETL are managing over $5 billion in Bipartisan and Infrastructure Law (BIL) and IRA funding directed toward Carbon Management and Resource Sustainability (oil & gas).This paper will examine the progress and achievements of FECM and NETL in developing a carbon management solution that tackles both sources of carbon: carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). It covers an overview of the current program, lessons learned from the program and project execution, and the status of ongoing funding opportunity announcements.

Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into sustainable fuels and base chemicals requires precise control over and understanding of activity, selectivity and stability descriptors of the electrocatalyst under operation. Identification of the active phase under working conditions, but also deactivation factors after prolonged operation, are of the utmost importance to further improve electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 conversion. Here, we present a multiscale in situ investigation of activation and deactivation pathways of oxide-derived copper electrocatalysts under CO2 reduction conditions. Using well-defined Cu2O octahedra and cubes, in situ X-ray scattering experiments track morphological changes at small scattering angles and phase transformations at wide angles, with millisecond to second time resolution and ensemble-scale statistics. We find that undercoordinated active sites promote CO2 reduction products directly after Cu2O to Cu activation, whereas less active planar surface sites evolve over time. These multiscale insights highlight the dynamic and intimate relationship between electrocatalyst structure, surface-adsorbed molecules, and catalytic performance, and our in situ X-ray scattering methodology serves as an additional tool to elucidate the factors that govern electrocatalyst (de)stabilization. The development of robust materials for electrochemical CO2 conversion requires identification of the activation and deactivation phase after prolonged operation. Here, the authors present a multiscale in situ X-ray scattering methodology to probe the life and death of copper oxide electrocatalysts.

Achieving high product selectivity at ampere‐level current densities is essential for the industrial application of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the operational stability of CO2 electrolyzers at large current density has long been hindered by flooding of gas diffusion layer (GDL). Herein, a new heteroarchitectural GDL is designed to overcome flooding. Such GDL is constructed by sequentially sputtering the conductive silver and titanium boride (TiB2) onto a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate. Assembled with Cu catalyst in a flow cell, a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 64.7% was achieved at a current density of 1.2 A cm−2 in 6 M KOH. Furthermore, the GDL is capable of stable operation for over 40 hours at 400 mA cm−2. Theoretical calculations and in‐situ experiments demonstrate enhanced intermediates adsorption on the TiB2‐supported Cu surface, thereby reducing the energy barrier for C‐C coupling. When coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2% for ethylene and 85.4% for 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid were achieved at 1.2 A cm−2. This work provides a highly stable GDL for efficient CO2 conversion at ampere‐level current density and paves the way for integrating biomolecules conversion in stack‐level devices.

In this study, a performance comparison experiment with a vortex exhaust installed at the end of a ventilation device to enhance the effect induced by reducing indoor pollutants was conducted. The experiment was carried out by constructing a mock-up room with a limited indoor environment, and performances were compared based on the following two tests. First, to confirm the effect of pollutant reduction, the wind speed was measured based on the distance from each exhaust system to verify the depth and speed at which wind can flow. Pollutants were induced to the vortex exhaust, general exhaust gasses were generated, and their performances were compared. Second, Arizona dust was used to confirm the performance with regard to the removal of pollutants which existed in particulate form (PM 10), and for CO2 gas, a representative gaseous pollutant was used as a reference. Based on the results, it was confirmed that installing a vortex exhaust system can allow for the generation of wind speeds that allow propagation at greater depths (>110 mm) compared to cases in which general exhaust is used; accordingly, exhaust performance can be achieved at increased depths. In addition, the experiment confirmed that vortex exhaust can improve the efficiency of simultaneous removal of PM 10 and CO2 compared with general exhaust. Further, it was shown that installing a vortex exhaust system can remove PM 10 and CO2 farther from the exhaust port in a shorter period than a general exhaust port. In addition, it was inferred that vortex exhaust can be utilized to prevent indoor pollutants and diseases in combination with the latest technology.    

    

## Assembly of Functionalized Organic Fragments via Reductive Activation and (Cross)-Coupling of C2H4, CO, CO2 and/or H2 using a Magnesium-Dinitrogen Complex

Reactions of 1,2-dimagnesioethane compound [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-C2H4)] (TCHPNON = 4,5-bis(2,4,6-tricyclohexylanilido)-2,7-diethyl-9,9-dimethyl-xanthene), formed by the two-electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N2, viz. [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)], with CO and CO2 have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross-coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-O2C4H4)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-O2C4H4)(THF)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-C2H4)] with CO2 led to insertion of CO2 into both Mg‒C bonds and all Mg‒N bonds of the 1,2-dimagnesioethane species, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg}2(-O4C4H4)], in which the diamide ligands of the starting material have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reactions can be viewed as involving the “masked-magnesium(I)” induced cross-coupling of ethene with either CO or CO2, to give more complex organic products. Reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to insertion of CO2 into all Mg‒N bonds of the magnesium-dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg}2(-O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this dissociates to monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(-O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2. In contrast, C‒C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] with a CO2 analogue, i.e. the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed intermediate containing a reduced carbodiimide radical fragment, gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]∞. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(-H)}2] (formed by activation of H2 with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)]), gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON-CO2)Mg}(-O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into only one Mg‒N bond of each TCHPNON ligand. All of the above-mentioned reactions reveal the capacity of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross-coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C2H4, CO, CO2 and H2, to give value-added organic fragments.

Low‐cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)‐etching and in situ growth of metal‐organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron‐sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST‐n (POM = PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero‐interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226 µmol g‐1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010 µmol g‐1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02 µmol g‐1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu‐MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1< x ≤2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron‐sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface‐coating metal‐organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the ternary composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60 h without noticeable activity loss.

This study investigates the application of pipe freeze crystallization (PFC) as a sustainable, zero-waste technology for treating high-salinity industrial wastewater, enabling the simultaneous recovery of salts and clean water. PFC addresses the limitations of traditional brine treatment methods such as evaporation ponds and distillation, which are energy-intensive, produce concentrated brine requiring disposal, and emit significant CO2. A pilot demonstration plant in Olifantsfontein, South Africa, served as the basis for this research. The plant operates at an energy consumption rate of 330 kJ/kg, significantly lower than distillation’s 2200 kJ/kg. It efficiently recovers high-purity Na2SO4 and clean ice, which can be reused as water, with plans underway to incorporate NaCl recovery. Comparative analyses highlight PFC’s energy efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, achieving an 82% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to evaporation-based methods. This study evaluates the operational parameters and scalability of PFC for broader industrial applications. X-ray Diffraction analysis confirmed that the Na2SO4 recovered from the pilot plant achieved a purity level of 84.9%, demonstrating the process’s capability to produce valuable, market-ready by-products.

This study addresses the challenges of and opportunities for achieving the ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of the fishery sector of the Republic of Korea, set at 96% by 2030. We also focus on the current status of land-based aquaculture and underground seawater resource development, quantitatively compare energy inputs for land-based fish cultivation, and evaluate the potential of underground seawater to reduce CO2 emissions. Since 2010, 762 underground seawater boreholes have been developed, yielding a cumulative daily pumpage of 125,780 m3. Jeollanam-do was found to have the highest daily pumpage, with an annual energy requirement of 131,205,613 Mcal. Despite the fact that the energy demands for underground seawater are higher in some months, it provides a 22.6% reduction in total annual energy consumption compared to surface water. The use of underground seawater for heating or cooling resulted in a 24.1% reduction in the required input energy. However, energy requirements increase due to the relatively high surface water temperature in some regions and seasons. This study also highlights the utilization of underground seawater in heating or cooling surface water via indirect applications using geothermal heat pumps. This innovative research broadens the methods of greenhouse gas mitigation, particularly in the agriculture, livestock, and fisheries industries.

Abstract The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is required to convert CO2 into useful commodity chemicals with renewable energy thereby reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. We report significantly enhanced CRR activity by incorporating the s-donating, e- reservoir ligand Imdye (1-imidazole-2,4,6-tri(carbazol-9-yl)-3,5-dicyanobenzene) within the complex fac-[MnI(bpy)(CO)3(Imdye)]+ (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine). The reduction potentials of Imdye, MnI/0, and CO2 to CO are close, allowing the active catalyst [Mn0(bpy)(CO)2(Imdye-)]- to provide 2e- to CO2 at small overpotentials. This system reduces CO2 to CO with bulk turnover numbers up to 830 very near the CRR reduction potential. This CRR activity arose from Imdye promoting the CRR at small overpotentials, and from utilizing the electrooxidation of CH3OH/H2O to CO2, 6H+ and 6e- at the Pt counter electrode, neutralizing pH changes from the CRR. These strategies will apply to most CRR electrocatalytic systems.

## Removing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Using Large Land Or Ocean Areas Will

When large surface areas of the Earth are altered, radiative forcing due to changes in surface reflectance can drive climate change. Yet to achieve the necessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters to have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo modification (SAM) can easily overwhelm the reduction in radiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 due to ERW or mCDR over timescales of decades. SAM via ERW can be either cooling or warming. We identify some of the many questions raised by radiative forcing due to these forms of CDR.    

    

## Evaluation of the Applicability of Basalt for CO2 Storage based on Geological and Petrological Properties

To promote the practical application of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), it is important to reduce the monitoring costs after the completion of injection and to increase social acceptance, and CO2 mineralization is thought to contribute to both. In particular, the use of basalt as a reservoir could be a solution not only to promote CO2 mineralization, but also to expand its storage potential. On the other hand, enhanced weathering as a negative emission technology is expected to be one of the local CO2 reduction measures using basalt. To evaluate the applicability of Japanese basalts for CO2 storage and enhanced weathering, geological surveys and rock sampling were conducted at outcrops of basalt volcanoes that were formed on the seafloor in the past and subsequently exposed at the surface, as well as relatively new onshore basalt volcanoes. Comparison of basalt properties by region revealed that basalt with the excellent injectivity essential for storage is limited, and that an evaluation of the entire rock mass over a wider area is necessary. In contrast, with respect to mineralization potential, the results suggest that the rate of leaching of ions, which are the raw materials for carbonate minerals, is more important than the absolute amount of these ions, in the short term.

Besides the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the reduction of aviation's climate impact requires the mitigation of its other forcing effects, most importantly the avoidance of warming condensation trails (contrails). From current understanding a decrease of both, soot and water vapor emissions from aircraft engines yields a reduced occurrence and persistence of contrails and contrail cirrus, reducing their radiative forcing. The WaterEnhanced Turbofan (WET) for instance is one concept that achieves both effects through water recovery from the engine exhaust and particle washout. In this first set of simplified sensitivity studies applying the established Contrail Cirrus Prediction (CoCiP) tool, we simulate and assess the impact of potential soot number and water vapor emission reductions on contrail radiative effect and optical properties in an application scenario in Europe. We find a non-linear impact of the soot particle reduction, which is strongest if soot number concentration is reduced by more than one order of magnitude compared to current engines. For water vapor, a large impact on contrail radiative effect is achieved by a reduction of one order of magnitude. Both effects can be combined almost independently. Therefore, we expect a significant decrease in contrail radiative effect if WET-like technologies were applied to a broad fleet. Nevertheless, other contrail nucleation pathways like condensation on volatile particles have not been considered in this study.

Rice serves as a crucial staple food for nearly half of the world's population. However, rice paddies contribute remarkably to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Prior studies often showed a trade-off between reducing GHG emissions and impairing rice yield. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing modulating probiotics to develop a win-win strategy for enhancing rice yields while reducing GHG emissions. Three paired plots of rice paddies were used in the field experiment during the spring growing season (from February to July 2022). Each pair of plots was divided into control and probiotic addition paddies to investigate the effects of modulating probiotic treatment on GHG emissions using the whole-plant chambers. Our results revealed notable reductions in GHG emissions and increases in rice yield with the probiotic treatment relative to the control. The probiotic treatment resulted in a 47.58% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a 21.53% reduction in methane (CH4) emissions, and an impressive 88.50% reduction in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions over the growing season. We also observed a 27.75% increase in rice yield with the probiotic treatment. These findings suggest that employing modulating probiotics has the potential to pave the way for mutually beneficial outcomes, enhancing rice productivity while mitigating the GHG emissions associated with rice cultivation.

A good quantitative knowledge of regional sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle. It is also a key prerequisite for elaborating cost-effective national strategies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. However, available estimates of CO2 fluxes for many regions of the world remain uncertain, despite significant recent progress in the remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation and atmospheric CO2. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of inferring reliable regional estimates of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) retrieved from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) observations as constraints on parameters of the widely used Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration model (VPRM), which predicts ecosystem fluxes based on vegetation indices derived from multispectral satellite imagery. We developed a regional-scale inverse modeling system that applies a Bayesian variational optimization algorithm to optimize parameters of VPRM coupled to the CHIMERE chemistry transport model and which involves a preliminary transformation of the input XCO2 data that reduces the impact of the CHIMERE boundary conditions on inversion results. We investigated the potential of our inversion system by applying it to a European region (that includes, in particular, the EU countries and the UK) for the warm season (May–September) of 2021. The inversion of the OCO-2 observations resulted in a major (more than threefold) reduction of the prior uncertainty in the regional NEE estimate. The posterior NEE estimate agrees with independent estimates provided by the CarbonTracker Europe High-Resolution (CTE-HR) system and the ensemble of the v10 OCO-2 model intercomparison (MIP) global inversions. We also found that the inversion improves the agreement of our simulations of XCO2 with retrievals from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Our sensitivity test experiments using synthetic XCO2 data indicate that the posterior NEE estimate would remain reliable even if the actual regional CO2 fluxes drastically differed from their prior values. Furthermore, the posterior NEE estimate is found to be robust to strong biases and random uncertainties in the CHIMERE boundary conditions. Overall, this study suggests that our approach offers a reliable and relatively simple way to derive robust estimates of CO2 ecosystem fluxes from satellite XCO2 observations while enhancing the applicability of VPRM in regions where eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes are scarce.

The present study investigates the impact of bulk viscosity on the complex flow dynamics past a rotating cylinder, with particular emphasis on compressible and non-equilibrium effects that emerge in nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). By solving unsteady conservation laws obtained from the Boltzmann–Curtiss transport equation, the research focuses on key flow features such as vortex shedding, vorticity generation, enstrophy, kinetic energy dissipation, and the degree of thermal non-equilibrium. Numerical simulations are performed at a Mach number of 0.6 using the dbnsTurbFoam solver with unstructured meshes, and the computational model is verified using available data for flow past a rotating cylinder. The results reveal that bulk viscosity significantly affects vortex shedding, particularly suppressing vortex formation and reducing flow instability. In CO2, high bulk viscosity nearly eliminates vortex shedding, leading to a laminar wake, while in N2, vortex shedding is dampened but persists. Enstrophy and vorticity production through stretching and baroclinic effects are also reduced in both gases as bulk viscosity increases, with CO2 showing more dramatic reductions due to its higher inherent viscosity. The study further indicates that bulk viscosity enhances kinetic energy dissipation in both gases, with N2 exhibiting sharper dissipation than CO2. Additionally, the role of rotational speed is explored, showing that higher rotational speeds amplify vorticity production and energy dissipation. While high-speed rotation induces more turbulence and instability in N2, it stabilizes the flow in CO2, leading to a more organized wake. The findings demonstrate that bulk viscosity and rotational speed are crucial in controlling flow stability and energy dissipation, with significant variations depending on the gas properties.

This study focuses on the use of advanced neural network methods to predict the transient behavior of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes in the presence of disturbances in gas separation/purification units, specifically targeting the upgrading of biogas by separating methane (CH4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) utilizing carbon molecular sieve (CMS) as the adsorbent. The cyclic nature of PSA, with its sequence of adsorption, depressurization, blowdown, purging, pressure equalization and repressurization steps, necessitates robust modeling techniques to achieve high purity rates. This paper emphasizes the development and validation of surrogate models based on NARX, LSTM and GRU neural networks that can replicate the PSA process with high fidelity, thus offering significant reductions in computational time compared to traditional methods. The study's findings indicate that LSTM networks provide the best balance of accuracy and speed, making them a viable tool for real-time optimization and control of PSA systems. In other words, while the pseudo-real plant's runtime surpasses 20 sec per cycle, creating difficulties for real-time optimization and control applications, the LSTM-based surrogate model can accurately predict the desired outputs for 900 cycles in just 0.63 sec, with an outstanding error magnitude of 1e-6, which is less than 0.004 % of the full-order model.

It is well known that there is a positive correlation between a high standard of living and access to affordable and reliable energy. Energy provides the foundation for human progress and economic opportunity. Continued access to an expanded energy supply is necessary to support a growing global population and to elevate a larger portion of that population towards an improved circumstance.Of equal importance is the concern that traditional energy production has exacerbated a climate and environmental crisis. Rising greenhouse gas emissions, in particular the increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), have reached a level that now requires immediate action. Ideally, there exists a portfolio of solutions that will allow energy delivery to continue alongside emissions reduction.Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UN IPCC) have stated that widespread deployment of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is required to achieve the emissions reductions targets outlined within the Paris Agreement. It is recognized that CCS technologies maintain a strategic role in the pursuit of a low carbon future. However, implementation of CCS projects has been slow, resulting in limited impact to date on global CO2 emissions.Urgent action is needed across all regions and sectors to achieve climate objectives. These ambitions require a significant and rapid increase in investment in CCS project development and ongoing technological innovation. To achieve this momentum, governments need to set enabling policy and regulatory frameworks that support a business case for broad adoption.To demonstrate effective CCS policy, GLJ will review multiple jurisdictions where CCS progress has already begun. Effective legal and regulatory regimes facilitate CCS activities, allowing for rapid technological evolution and decreasing cost structures. These can serve as examples for additional jurisdictions to craft documentation that provides clarity and certainty to create markets and to encourage private investment. Important information will be provided from Canada, the United States, Norway, and Indonesia. Topics to be considered will include: • Pore space ownership – who owns it and who can use it?• Liability – who is responsible for storage permanence and what does that mean?• Monitoring, Measurement, and Verification (MMV) – who designs, conducts and reports?• Taxes and incentives – who pays for it and who benefits from it?Even in jurisdictions that have made substantial regulatory progress, there still remain gaps to fill and enhancements to consider. GLJ will reflect on several key topics that continue to challenge the durability of CCS frameworks and the collaborative action that large scale industrial development requires:• Transboundary portability of CO2 and carbon credits – if emissions reduction is a global issue, why do intra-national and international borders get in the way of project development?• Contract for differences – what is it and is it a good thing?• Environmental Justice and Equity Considerations – how does early engagement impact permitting timelines?GLJ reviewed the CCS policy and legal landscapes of these and other jurisdictions to develop recommendations regarding enabling regulations in support of widespread and rapid CCS deployment across the globe. Additionally, an evaluation such as this is done to inform stakeholders in an effort to build stakeholder confidence through assurance of a well-regulated industry. To achieve the scale needed for CCS to fulfil its intended role as a major global emissions abatement opportunity, governments, project proponents, and the global population must be aligned regarding the critical need for this proven emissions management tool. All must be involved in the discussion to take a very real and necessary step towards additional CCS project implementation.

A high-resolution carbon dioxide emission inventory is essential for accurate carbon emission assessment and management. This study used a top-down spatial proxy model to develop a high-resolution (1 km) carbon dioxide emission inventory for East Asia from 2012 to 2021. Combining multiple data sources with geographically weighted regressions can improve the accuracy of the spatial distribution of sectors within carbon dioxide inventories. To demonstrate accuracy, we compared our inventory with existing carbon dioxide inventories, such as the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China, which uses a 'bottom-up' approach. We outline and discuss the convergence and divergence in the estimation results of the different approaches, finding generally consistent results. Based on the high-resolution carbon dioxide grid, nationally, China accounted for over 80% of East Asia's carbon dioxide emissions, followed by Japan and South Korea. The results of the hotspot and driver analyses reveal persistent hotspots in Northern and Eastern China, as well as new trends in Northwestern China. The main drivers of emissions growth in hotspots are economic growth and changes in the energy mix. The drivers of emission changes in cold hotspot regions vary depending on regional characteristics. Actionable insights are provided for targeted regional carbon reduction strategies. Continued growth of carbon dioxide emissions occurred across Northern and Eastern China in the period 2012-2021, and a new growth hotspot emerged in Northwest China, according to a high-resolution top-down emissions inventory for East Asia.

Abstract In addition to steep carbon emission reductions, all modeled pathways to reach global climate goals require carbon removal. Marine carbon dioxide removal has the potential to play a large role in drawing down legacy anthropogenic emissions due to the scalability and durability of proposed methods. While this field is rapidly expanding, a number of issues remain, including efforts to grow the industry, align projects with equity and justice goals, and ensure development of trusted, unique, durable carbon credits. We, a group of early career ocean professionals (ECOPs), provide an overview of the scale of the field, the aforementioned issues, and then make recommendations to ensure global equity and expand early career capacity in the marine carbon dioxide removal sector. We argue that substantial investment is needed to reduce costs of marine carbon dioxide removal and spur innovation in monitoring, reporting, and verification, but also in the training and development of early career researchers. Careful co‐design of marine removal projects by experienced and emerging collaborators, including local communities, can help mitigate perpetuating existing global inequalities. Given the anticipated growth of the marine carbon dioxide removal workforce, ECOPs can contribute their existing interdisciplinary expertise, if they are supported within traditional structures. Those entering the field can leverage skill sets that intersect engineering, policy, community engagement, and business. We maintain that ECOPs will be key leaders in the field, if appropriately engaged, compensated, and empowered.    

    

## Importance of adaptive baseline measurement monitoring and verification (MMV) studies at CCS projects: lessons from Aquistore, Saskatchewan, Canada

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized as an essential technology for mitigating global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), and offers a viable pathway toward a low-carbon economy. Canada has emerged as a leader in CCS, with several operational projects and significant planned investments. However, public perception remains a persistent challenge, largely due to concerns about CO2 containment, as highlighted by incidents such as the historical Kerr complaints in Weyburn, Canada, where false leakage allegations led to extensive investigations.The success of CCS projects lies in the implementation of robust Measurement, Monitoring, and Verification (MMV) systems. Such systems ensure the safety and security of injected CO2. Surface MMV, specifically the comparison of surface soil gas emission patterns to pre-injection baselines, plays a key role in gaining public trust, as it provides insight into natural variability and demonstrates the ability to detect potential leaks. The Aquistore project is a state-of-the-art CCS science project in Saskatchewan, Canada, designed to test, among other things, the efficacy of MMV programs. The surface soil-gas MMV program at Aquistore uses mainly process-based indicators, including gas concentrations of CO2, oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), and the radiocarbon isotope CO2 (14CO2). Unlike other sites, these parameters were measured extensively in a pre-injection baseline study and subsequently monitored post-injection at regular bi-annual intervals.This paper examines the strengths and challenges of the process-based MMV approach while highlighting the role of adaptability over time, as demonstrated by the Aquistore experience. Since 2012, the surface soil-gas MMV program has evolved to address the changing project needs, integrating an adaptive sampling strategy that reduced resource demands while maintaining data integrity. Over a decade, a well-established baseline dataset, including pre-injection measurements, proved essential for accurate interpretation. Although no baseline geochemical surface soil-gas MMV research at this site has shown evidence of surface impacts due to CO2 injection, pre- and post-injection monitoring consistently identified old 14CO2 values. Initially, these 14CO2 signatures appeared to indicate fossil-sourced CO2 rising to the surface in parts of the monitoring area. However, further investigation revealed that these anomalous 14CO2 signatures predated injection and were linked to the microbial decomposition of weathered coal fragments from historic surface coal mining at the site. Without the extensive and adaptive baseline monitoring dataset, these findings could have been misinterpreted, emphasizing the significance of an MMV approach that evolves throughout the project lifecycle to enhance the reliability of CCS monitoring programs.Despite the effectiveness, the existing integrated process-based framework and adaptive baseline MMV approach pose challenges, including labor intensity, surface detection limitations, and reliance on pre-existing data. Basin analysis at Aquistore has shown no significant preferential pathways between the storage site and the surface. However, risk assessments identified the most probable CO2 migration path along the injection and monitoring wells due to potential well integrity issues. To address these challenges, a partial shift to a risk-based monitoring approach is proposed in this paper, incorporating modern continuous sensor and algorithm systems to monitor high-risk areas continuously and non-invasively, with a proportional reduction in process-based sampling. These advanced systems, which were unavailable during the initial design of the Aquistore MMV program, provide a more targeted and maintainable solution by combining CO2 and CH4 sensors with Lagrangian back-trajectory algorithms to detect anomalies, minimizing false positives through geochemical ratios and spatial matching.Findings from Aquistore underscore the importance of adaptive and continuous baseline monitoring to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpretation, such as those seen in previous leak allegations at the Weyburn site. Ultimately, a well-conceived baseline MMV framework is less costly than responding to seepage allegations, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive MMV in successful CCS deployment.

China's aging population society has entered a high-speed deepening stage, promoting energy saving and emission reduction, realizing low carbon development history is an important strategic task in our country. On the Basis of panel data since 2011 to 2021, using an intermediate effect model, this paper studies the relations among the population aging, industry structure upgrading as well as rationalization and the emission of carbon dioxide. The results indicate that aging exerts a significant positive impact on carbon emissions. The influence of population aging on carbon emissions is inverted U shape. When aging reaches a certain level, the influence on carbon emissions has a nonlinear feature of decreasing marginal effect. The aging can exert a prominent influence on carbon emissions in the regions through upgrading and rationalization of the industrial structure. That influence about population aging on carbon emissions is remarkable in the region. Therefore, promoting the optimization process of industry structure forced by population aging contributes to realizing "reduction effect of carbon emissions" under the background of population aging.

Climate issues significantly impact people’s lives, prompting governments worldwide to implement energy-saving and emission-reducing measures. However, many areas lack carbon emission data at the lower administrative divisions. Additionally, the inconsistency in the standards, scope, and accuracy of carbon dioxide emission statistics across different regions makes mapping carbon dioxide spatial patterns complex. Nighttime light (NTL) data combined with land use data enable the detailed spatial and temporal disaggregation of carbon emission data at a finer administrative level, facilitating scientifically informed policy formulation by the government. Differentiating carbon emission data by sector will help us further identify the carbon emission efficiency in different sectors and help environmental regulators implement the most cost-effective emission-reduction strategy. This study uses integrated remote-sensing data to estimate carbon emissions from fossil fuels (CEFs). Experimental results indicate (1) that the regional CEF can be calculated by combining NTL and Landuse data and has a good fit; (2) the high-intensity CEF area is mainly concentrated in Shanghai and its surrounding areas, showing a concentric circle structure; (3) there are obvious differences in the spatial distribution characteristics of carbon emissions among different departments; (4) hot spot analysis reveals a three-tiered distribution in the Yangtze River Delta, increasing from the west to the east with distinct spatial characteristics.

This study intends to optimize the carbon footprint management model of power enterprises through artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help the scientific formulation of carbon emission reduction strategies. Firstly, a carbon footprint calculation model based on big data and AI is established, and then machine learning algorithm is used to deeply mine the carbon emission data of power enterprises to identify the main influencing factors and emission reduction opportunities. Finally, the driver-state-response (DSR) model is used to evaluate the carbon audit of the power industry and comprehensively analyze the effect of carbon emission reduction. Taking China Electric Power Resources and Datang International Electric Power Company as examples, this study uses the comprehensive evaluation method of entropy weight- technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). China Electric Power Resources Company has outstanding performance in promoting renewable energy, with its comprehensive evaluation index rising from 0.5458 in 2020 to 0.627 in 2022, while the evaluation index of Datang International Electric Power Company fluctuated and dropped to 0.421 in 2021. The research conclusion reveals the actual achievements and existing problems of power enterprises in energy saving and emission reduction, and provides reliable carbon information for the government, enterprises, and the public. The main innovation of this study lies in: using artificial intelligence technology to build a carbon footprint calculation model, combining with the data of International Energy Agency Carbon Dioxide (IEA CO 2 ) emission database, and using machine learning algorithm to deeply mine the important factors in carbon emission data, thus putting forward a carbon audit evaluation system of power enterprises based on DSR model. This study not only fills the blank of carbon emission management methods in the power industry, but also provides a new perspective and basis for the government and enterprises to formulate carbon emission reduction strategies.

Climate change and global warming demand immediate action, and a global carbon trading system can help by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon credits allow companies to emit a defined amount of carbon dioxide, with each credit typically equaling one ton. Although these credits incentivize emissions reduction, current systems lack transparency, face high transaction costs, and benefit intermediaries. Our project proposes a blockchain-based Carbon Credit Ecosystem that uses blockchain and smart contracts to create a more transparent, accessible, and efficient carbon market. This system will tokenize carbon credits, establish protocols for credit creation and retirement, and transparently manage trading. Engaging stakeholders like the energy sector, project verifiers, NGOs, citizens, and governments, our model provides broad benefits and is adaptable to other credit and trading systems.

Wind and solar generation constitute an increasing share of electricity supply globally. We find that this leas to shifts in the operational dynamics of thermal power plants. Using fixed effects panel regression across seven major U.S. balancing authorities, we analyze the impact of renewable generation on coal, natural gas combined cycle plants, and natural gas combustion turbines. Wind generation consistently displaces thermal output, while effects from solar vary significantly by region, achieving substantial displacement in areas with high solar penetration such as the California Independent System Operator but limited impacts in coal reliant grids such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator. Renewable energy sources effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions in regions with flexible thermal plants, achieving displacement effectiveness as high as one hundred and two percent in the California Independent System Operator and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. However, in coal heavy areas such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland Interconnection, inefficiencies from ramping and cycling reduce carbon dioxide displacement to as low as seventeen percent and often lead to elevated nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions. These findings underscore the critical role of grid design, fuel mix, and operational flexibility in shaping the emissions benefits of renewables. Targeted interventions, including retrofitting high emitting plants and deploying energy storage, are essential to maximize emissions reductions and support the decarbonization of electricity systems.

ABSTRACT As urban areas expand, energy demands are escalating, necessitating the development of urban energy systems (UES) to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction goals. Although small‐scale regional integrated energy supply technologies have reached a level of maturity, urban‐scale integrated energy supply solutions are still in development. In response, this study introduces an architecture for the UES and an economic and low‐carbon operation strategy. The approach begins by constructing a highly reliable and robust integrated energy system (IES) within each independent region to accommodate a variety of energy needs, followed by the establishment of an operational architecture for large‐scale urban energy systems. The study then examines the energy flow and the mathematical model of multiple energies within urban energy systems, simplifying the complex model for practical application. Subsequently, a multiobjective optimization model is developed to facilitate the large‐scale consumption of clean energy, with considerations for economic and low‐carbon operations, and is formatted into a linear programming model. The model's accuracy is empirically tested through numerical simulation in a city divided into three regions. The simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in clean energy consumption, a reduction in carbon emissions, and a decrease in operational costs. Specifically, the proposed strategy can boost the clean energy consumption rate to 96.41%, cut operational costs by up to 50.13%, and lower carbon dioxide emissions by up to 57.59% compared to traditional technologies. These findings robustly validate the methodology's effectiveness, paving the way for more sustainable urban energy management practices.

With the increasing concern about global warming and future climate change, attention has been drawn to the need to reduce building energy use through improving buildings’ energy efficiency. Existing residential buildings constitute the largest percentage of energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions, and hence, offer significant potential for energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This review aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of current research on improving the energy efficiency of existing residential buildings in Libya and neighbouring Mediterranean countries, with a focus on research methods and tools utilised in this domain. This helped to identify potential areas of intervention to improve the energy efficiency of existing residential stock in Libya. Under identified themes, this study systematically analysed 44 publications of high relevance to the subject area found in Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The results reveal that while energy retrofitting is a research area of interest in the region considered, studies in the Libyan context are limited. There is also limited attention to achieving net zero energy and embodied carbon reductions, specifically in the Libyan context. Moreover, some weaknesses were identified for most of the studies reviewed, including those in the Libyan context, related to the credibility and reliability of the energy models used in the various literature.

Power-to-X (P2X) pathways represent alternative storage technologies for utilization of surplus electricity from renewable energy sources (RES) and for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. These P2X pathways can be used to convert renewable surplus electricity and carbon dioxide from various sources into valuable products such as synthetic fuels and chemicals. Significant progress has been made in these processes towards replacement of conventional fossil fuel-based technologies in the recent years. In this paper the development of these novel technologies is reviewed, having a focus especially on the techno-economic analysis. Key performance indicators such as plant efficiency and production cost are discussed. Finally, knowledge gaps and future research outlook of P2X are highlighted.

Concrete stands as the world's second most widely used material, valued for its abundance, affordability, durability, versatility, and resilience—a crucial asset for both developed and emerging economies. In 2022, the cement industry made a significant contribution, releasing 2.4 GtCO₂, equivalent to 6.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the current concrete production rate at 14 billion m³ and the projected demand expected to reach 20 billion m³ by 2050, gaining a thorough understanding of concrete's carbon footprint is increasingly imperative.This study aims to determine the conditions required for concrete to achieve a net-negative emissions footprint throughout its entire cradle-to-grave life cycle. Taking a comprehensive approach, we explore the often-overlooked natural carbonation of concrete during its use and end-of-life stages. Our investigation encompasses three distinct carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) pathways: carbonation curing, carbon injection, and enhanced mineralization. Each pathway plays a unique role in reducing carbon footprint.In the case of carbon injection, reducing the cement content through enhanced compressive strength results in a decreased initial cement content in the mix, while also enabling concrete to uptake a minimal amount of carbon dioxide during its manufacturing stage. Enhanced mineralization involves substituting cement with other minerals like wollastonite to achieve the necessary strength and applying a cement substitution credit to assess the impact on carbon footprint reduction. Lastly, carbonation curing taps into the carbon uptake potential of concrete by utilizing existing carbon dioxide reactants in concrete. All these pathways have the potential to influence the natural carbon absorption by concrete, particularly during its service life and end-of-life stages, aspects often neglected in other studies.These pathways involve energy-intensive processes, such as the pre-treatment of minerals or carbonation curing of concrete, which counteract the goal of reducing the carbon footprint, while also avoiding other carbon-intensive processes often present in the life cycle of concrete such as steam curing. Recognizing the relevance of electricity grid carbon intensity in this context, we incorporate a sensitivity analysis. By evaluating results across various electricity grid scenarios with differing carbon intensities, we aim to assess the carbon footprint and viability of each pathway under different background conditions. This analysis looks to uncover the robustness of results in settings marked by both low and high levels of grid decarbonization, in addition to the baseline scenario. Our findings promise valuable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders navigating the complex landscape of sustainable concrete production. Also, for the carbonation curing pathway, as it is usually regarded as a method that increases the durability of concrete, we investigate the impact of changes in the service life of concrete.Business-as-usual and concrete produced via these pathways are investigated to uncover the service life carbon uptake and its changes due to the implementation of these pathways. Moreover, concrete's end-of-life carbon uptake, often ignored, is evaluated alongside its intrinsic carbon footprint to uncover the impact of the recycling rate on the reduction of concrete's total carbon footprint.In conclusion, concrete's paramount role in global construction demands a nuanced examination of its environmental impact. This study aims not only to identify pathways toward achieving a net-negative emissions footprint but also to shed light on the intricate interplay between innovative carbon capture methods and the inherent carbon sequestration capabilities of concrete. Through meticulous analysis and consideration of diverse scenarios, we aim to contribute valuable knowledge to the ongoing dialogue surrounding environmentally conscious concrete production.

This study investigates the direct synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME) from syngas using the existing methanol production infrastructure at the Methanol and Synthetic Resins complex in Arzew, Algeria. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of repurposing the adiabatic multiphase fixed-bed methanol production reactor for DME production while maintaining the original reactor dimensions, flow conditions, syngas composition, as well as temperature and pressure parameters used in methanol production. The research introduced a significant modification by replacing the initial copper oxide-based catalyst with a hybrid catalyst composed of γ-alumina and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3. This catalyst enables the direct production of DME from syngas, which is a mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. The study employed simulation models using Aspen-HYSYS V11 to predict DME productivity, manage the high temperatures resulting from exothermic reactions in each catalyst bed, and determine the required quench gas injection for temperature reduction. The simulation results indicated an overall DME yield of 2.81%, which is comparable to the methanol production rate of 3%. Further simulations with recycling stages increased the crude DME mass to 4.11%. These findings highlight the potential of using the current infrastructure to improve profitability and time efficiency in producing this alternative fuel.

The purpose of this study is to effectively support the operation of biogas plants that utilize anaerobic digestion of pig manure. An analysis was conducted on the characteristics of manure collected from 17 pig farms. Following this, the methane potential of the manure was evaluated, and a comparison of microbial communities was made at the end of the biochemical methane potential test. Based on these analyses, methane production during anaerobic digestion was modeled under various scenarios, allowing for the calculation of expected electricity generation and carbon dioxide reduction. The experimental results were categorized according to manure management type and the types of pigs raised. In this study, at a temperature of 37 °C and a hydraulic retention time of 30 days, the scraper method demonstrated the highest methane production rates, achieving 0.85 and 1.03 m3/m3/day for both mono-anaerobic digestion of manure and co-digestion with food wastewater. However, establishing definitive characteristics of manure management types requires the collection of more comprehensive data from a broader range of farms, which will be critical for conducting further in-depth research.

Our reduction target is fossil fuel origin CO2 in exhaust gas from asphalt mixing plants. We have examined two methods (wet mineralization and direct mineralization) using recycled crusher-run (RC) in CO2 fixation. Wet mineralization has an advantage of creating pure CaCO3 but water extraction process to obtain Ca from RC needs much water and re-dry process of RC before selling. Compared to wet mineralization, direct mineralization seemed to be cost effective for CO2 reduction at asphalt plant. CO2 directly fixed on RC will be stored in the ground as roadbed material for a long period of time and contribute to reduce emission of CO2 to the atmosphere.

Designing catalysts for the selective reduction of CO2, resulting in products having commercial value, is an important area of contemporary research. Several molecular catalysts have been reported to facilitate the reduction of CO2 (both electrochemical and photochemical) to yield 2e–/2H+ electron-reduced products, CO and HCOOH, and selective reduction of CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ is rare. This is partly because the factors that control the selectivity of CO2 reduction beyond 2e– are not yet understood. An iron chlorin complex with a pendent amine functionality in its second sphere, known to selectively catalyze CO2RR to HCOOH with a very low overpotential from its formal Fe(I) state, can catalyze CO2RR from its formal Fe(0) state by 6e–/6H+, forming CH3OH as a major product with a Faradaic yield of ∼50%. Mechanistic investigations using in situ spectro-electrochemistry indicate that the reactivity of a low-spin d7 FeI–COOH intermediate species generated during CO2RR is crucial in determining the product selectivity of this reaction. In weakly acidic conditions, C-protonation of this FeI–COOH species, which is also chemically prepared and spectroscopically characterized, leads to HCOOH. The O-protonation, leading to C–OH bond cleavage and eventually to CH3OH, is ∼3 kcal/mol higher in energy and can be achieved in more acidic solutions. Hydrogen bonding to the pendent amine in the catalyst stabilizes reactive intermediates formed in the CO2RR and enables 6e–/6H+ reduction of CO2 to CH3OH.

Objective Ecosystem services are the link between ecosystems and social systems. While effectively coordinating regional ecological, social and economic needs and promoting carbon sequestration and emission reduction, ecosystem services can be transmitted to surrounding areas to boost regional ecological space optimization. Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, clarifying the positive impact of ecosystem services on net carbon sink efficiency in metropolitan areas and the spillover effect of ecosystem services can effectively contribute to regional ecosystem service enhancement, and realize efficient carbon sequestration and reduction in ecological space. Methods Supported by multi-source panel data spanning the period from 2010 to 2020, this research takes the Shanghai Metropolitan Area as the research object and divides the research area into 40 research units. Based on the multiple benefits of ecosystem services in synergistically promoting urban sink enhancement and emission reduction, this research constructs a net carbon sink efficiency indicator system. Then, utilizing the undesirable slacks-based measurement (SBM) model, the research evaluates the net carbon sink efficiency of each unit during the period from 2010 to 2020, and further explores the distributional characteristics and spatial-temporal changes of carbon sinks, carbon emissions, and net carbon sink efficiency from the geospatial perspective. In combination with the guiding content of spatial synergistic planning for the Shanghai Metropolitan Area, four important ecosystem services, namely water retention, water purification, soil retention and biodiversity maintenance, are quantitatively characterized with the InVEST model. Subsequently, based on the spatial decomposition effects (direct, indirect and total effects) obtained with spatial econometric model, the influencing mechanisms of ecosystem services and their interrelationship on the net carbon sink efficiency of 40 research units are analyzed. In addition, the spatial spillover effects of ecosystem services are innovatively revealed according to ecosystem service flow conduction mechanisms. Results Research results are summarized as follows. 1) During the 11 years from the 2010 to 2020, the growth of carbon dioxide emissions in the Shanghai Metropolitan Area gradually slowed down, while the net primary productivity of vegetation continued to increase, and the areas with high carbon emissions and high carbon sinks were partially overlapped; in addition, the net carbon sink efficiency of some core nodes, such as Shanghai City, maintained a steady improvement, effectively driving neighboring cities to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sinks; meanwhile, the areas with improved net carbon sink efficiency have some similar characteristics and can be divided into 2 types: areas with high production value, high carbon emissions, and high carbon sinks, and those with medium-high production value, low carbon emissions, and medium-high carbon sinks. 2) The four ecosystem services have significant spatial heterogeneity and relatively stable changes over the 11-year period, with the high values mainly distributed in the southwestern part of the area with high vegetation cover and the area around the Taihu Lake with concentrated water resources, while the low values mainly distributed in the concentrated urban construction areas and near the regional traffic arteries, and the total amount of the four ecosystem services has shown fluctuating characteristics. 3) Regarding the spatial decomposition effects of ecosystem services on net carbon sink efficiency, there are differences in the coefficients, directions and significance of the spatial effects of different ecosystem services. For the ecosystem service trade-off index and relationship index, the direct effects are significantly positive, while indirect effects significantly negative. Conclusion The research clarifies that water-related ecosystem services such as water retention and water purification services can significantly affect carbon reduction and sink enhancement in the Shanghai Metropolitan Area, and attention should be paid to water network system and its coupling effects with green and grey spaces, so as to further stimulate the ecological vitality of Jiangnan water vein. As there are differences in the spillover effects of different ecosystem services, it is necessary to differentiate the optimization and enhancement strategies for each type of ecological space and its ecosystem services according to local conditions, and the conservation of important ecological spaces in the metropolitan area should be continuously strengthened, followed by joint protection and control of ecological red lines in neighboring areas, so as to promote territorial spatial carbon reduction and sink enhancement activities, thus contributing to the steady improvement of the net carbon sink efficiency of the Shanghai Metropolitan Area in general. The research clearly demonstrates the positive effects of enhancing water-related ecosystem services and conserving important ecological spaces on regional carbon sinks and reduction, and effectively reveals an effective path for synergistic carbon reduction in the region, which may provide certain reference for improving territorial spatial management.

Abstract Solar‐driven carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) provides an opportunity to produce value‐added chemical feedstocks and fuels. However, achieving efficient and stable photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO 2 RR into selective products is challenging owing to the difficulties associated with the optical and the electrical configuration of PEC devices and electrocatalyst properties. Herein, we construct an efficient, concentrated sunlight‐driven CO 2 RR setup consisting of InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple‐junction cell as a photoanode and oxide‐derived Au (Ox‐Au) as a cathode to perform the unassisted PEC CO 2 RR. Under one‐sun illumination, a maximum operating current density of 11.5 mA cm –2 with an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ~98% is achieved for carbon monoxide (CO) production, leading to a solar‐to‐fuel conversion efficiency of ~15%. Under concentrated intensity of 10 sun, the photoanode records a maximum current density of ~124 mA cm –2 and maintains ~60% of FE for CO production. The results demonstrate crucial advancements in using III–V based photoanodes for concentrated PEC CO 2 RR.

The Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C requires drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the balancing of any remaining emissions by carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Due to uncertainties about the potential and durability of many land-based approaches to deliver sufficient CDR, marine CDR options are receiving more and more interest. We present the current state of knowledge regarding the potentials, risks, side effects as well as challenges associated with technical feasibility, governance, monitoring, reporting and accounting of marine CDR, covering a range of biotic and geochemical approaches. We specifically discuss to what extent a comparison with direct injection of CO 2 into seawater, which had been proposed decades ago and is now prohibited by international agreements, may provide guidance for evaluating some of the biotic marine CDR approaches.

The European Union aims to become carbon-neutral by 2050 and to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The buildings sector accounts for about 40% of its total energy consumption and is responsible for 36% of the total CO2 emissions. For this reason, decarbonising the heat consumed in buildings is key to meeting these targets. CO2 emission reduction in buildings typically involves upgrading heating facilities to enable heat supply at lower temperatures, or renovating buildings, both of which can be challenging for end users. This paper analyses reducing emissions from residential buildings using high-temperature or hybrid heat pumps that can produce water at the same temperature as condensing boilers. This enables a significant reduction in emissions from buildings for owners who cannot afford or do not want to undertake a full renovation or upgrade of their current hydronic facility. The methodology followed makes use of a simplified hourly energy model based on ISO 52016-1:2017. The results indicate that, depending on the EU region, reducing CO2 emissions in buildings through these types of systems is feasible, leading to CO2 emission reductions of 40% to 70%.

Traditional CO2 reduction systems often fail in an alkaline environment due to the interaction of CO2 with a high-pH electrolyte, where carbonate and bicarbonate ion formation results in potassium-containing salt precipitation. The presence of the salt crystals causes a reduction in the selectivity of the electrolyzer toward CO2 conversion. Here, the critical operational variables, which elicit the salting out process, are investigated (i.e., ion transport). When the electrolyzer exceeds a critical current density, H2 evolution dominates CO2 reduction due to salt formation, which is confirmed by postmortem cross-sectional SEM-EDS of the electrode. The critical current density decreases with an increasing membrane thickness or anolyte ionic strength. Cathode salt formation is mediated by the unmitigated crossover of cations from the anolyte to the cathode across an anion exchange membrane, through which cations are imperfectly excluded. It is likely that electric field-driven migration promotes an increase in concentration of potassium across the membrane, until, at the critical current density for that electrolyzer arrangement, the concentration of potassium and bicarbonate ions exceeds the solubility limit of KHCO3, leading to salt precipitation.

This study analyzed the effectiveness of CO2 storage in basalt by simulating carbon mineralization during the injection of a CO2 solution into basalt cores. Porosity changes were assessed by modeling carbonate precipitation and basalt dissolution based on geochemical reactions. The correlation between the porosity and permeability was examined using the power-law equation to calculate the change in pressure during injection. The simulation results were validated by comparing the experimental data acquired from the Cheorwon region with respect to carbonate precipitation, porosity, permeability, and pressure difference. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effects of CO2 solution type and mineral composition on carbon mineralization using basalt samples from Cheorwon and Jeju as well as sandstone sample. The modeling and simulation methods used in this study can be applied to analyze the carbon reduction and mineralization trapping of the CO2 stored in basalt formations.

Compounds featuring bonds between mercury and transition metals are of interest for their intriguing/ambiguous bonding and scarcely explored reactivities. We report herein the synthesis and reactivities of the new compound [(POCOP)Ni]2Hg, [Ni2Hg], featuring a trinuclear Ni–Hg–Ni core (POCOP = κP,κC,κP´‐2,6‐(i‐Pr2PO)2C6H3). [Ni2Hg] reacts with CO2 to give the carbonate‐bridged complex [Ni2CO3]. Bubbling CO gas through a solution of [Ni2CO3] gave its μ−CO2 analogue [Ni2CO2], which itself reacts with CO2 to give back [Ni2CO3], indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of [Ni2CO3] from [Ni2Hg] and CO2 constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO2 into CO32‐ and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO2 insertion to give [Ni2CO2], followed by another CO2 insertion to give the second intermediate [Ni2C2O4], and the latter’s decarbonylation to give [Ni2CO3]. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a μ−carbonyl‐carbonate rather than a μ−oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation.

Compounds featuring bonds between mercury and transition metals are of interest for their intriguing/ambiguous bonding and scarcely explored reactivities. We report herein the synthesis and reactivities of the new compound [(POCOP)Ni]2Hg, [Ni2Hg], featuring a trinuclear Ni–Hg–Ni core (POCOP = κP,κC,κP´‐2,6‐(i‐Pr2PO)2C6H3). [Ni2Hg] reacts with CO2 to give the carbonate‐bridged complex [Ni2CO3]. Bubbling CO gas through a solution of [Ni2CO3] gave its μ−CO2 analogue [Ni2CO2], which itself reacts with CO2 to give back [Ni2CO3], indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of [Ni2CO3] from [Ni2Hg] and CO2 constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO2 into CO32‐ and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO2 insertion to give [Ni2CO2], followed by another CO2 insertion to give the second intermediate [Ni2C2O4], and the latter’s decarbonylation to give [Ni2CO3]. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a μ−carbonyl‐carbonate rather than a μ−oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation. Reduction of [Ni2CO3] with excess Na/Hg regenerates [Ni2Hg], establishing that the observed deoxygenation of CO2 in this system can, in principle, be catalytic in the presence of excess reductant.

Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) has been developing an indoor CO2 capture technology using dry sorbents since 2021 to improve indoor air quality and reduce Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) costs in various commercial buildings. Buildings account for approximately 40% of the world's carbon emissions, with heating and cooling being the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions as they account for the largest portion of building energy consumption. By integrating an indoor CO2 capture unit with an Air Handling Unit (AHU), this technology can efficiently capture CO2 from air and minimize the ratio of outdoor air supply, thereby reducing heating and cooling energy in buildings. The indoor CO2 capture technology employs a cyclic sorption and desorption process on a dry sorbent material. Considering that buildings are inhabited by people, inorganic materials such as K2CO3 were chosen as the indoor CO2 capture materials. The principle of the CO2 capture with K2CO3-based sorbents is the reversible reaction between K2CO3, CO2 and water vapor to form KHCO3 in a thermal-swing process. We evaluated the performance of the dry sorbent material, manufactured in pellet form at a kilogram scale, using the following procedures: 1) measuring the cyclic CO2 sorption capacity based on four sorption-desorption cycles through Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA); 2) assessing the CO2 sorption rate using a fixed-bed reactor; and 3) investigating the feasibility of our proposed new ventilation scheme in connection with an 8 m3 chamber and a 15 CMH-scale indoor CO2 capture unit experimental setup. The K2CO3-based sorbents (KCSB) consist of K2CO3 as the sorption material, activated carbon and silica as support and bentonite as an inorganic binder. In the TGA test, it showed a CO2 sorption capacity of 13.3 wt.% and a CO2 sorption rate of 0.05 mmol/g/min. In the fixed-bed test at approximately a 20-gram scale, the CO2 sorption rate is shown at 0.07 mmol/g/min. The results confirm that the KCSB sorbents show remarkably superior sorption capacity and sorption rate under indoor low CO2 concentration conditions.To investigate the feasibility of an energy-efficient ventilation scheme with an indoor CO2 capture unit, a 15 CMH-scale indoor CO2 capture unit was developed and integrated with an 8 m3 chamber. The test procedure consisted of four steps: 1) maintaining the CO2 concentration in the chamber at approximately 1,000 ppm; 2) starting the CO2 capture unit installed in the return air stream; 3) minimizing outdoor air intake; and 4) stopping the CO2 capture unit and proceeding to the desorption mode when the CO2 concentration in the chamber exceeded 800 ppm. In the 3rd cycle sorption mode, it showed a CO2 sorption capacity of 7.5 wt.% and a 65% reduction in outdoor air intake. From these results, it was confirmed that the introduction of indoor CO2 capture unit can lead to a reduction in outdoor air intake. Through the reduction in outdoor air intake, it is possible to achieve energy savings in heating and cooling systems. We plan to develop a dry-sorbent indoor CO2 capture unit as a modular system to scale up by increasing the number of modules.

Sources of methane emissions include agriculture, such as rice fields and livestock farming, energy production, such as natural gas and oil extraction, and waste disposal, such as landfills. As a potent greenhouse gas, methane has a more substantial short-term warming effect than carbon dioxide, so controlling methane emissions has become an essential goal of global climate action. Countries are reducing methane emissions through policies, regulations, and technical means. Research has found that methane emissions have significantly impacted China's climate system, leading to frequent extreme weather events and posing threats to ecosystems. The Chinese government has adopted emission reduction policies but faces challenges in policy implementation and technology application. This article uses a literature review to analyze the current status of methane emissions in China, analyze its impact on climate change, evaluate the effectiveness of current policies, and propose improvements. The technological obstacles to reducing methane emissions and the challenges in implementing policies are examined in this essay, which combines policy analysis with technical application discussions. This provides a new perspective for climate policy research, enriches the research content in greenhouse gas emission reduction, and offers solid theoretical support for the comprehensive governance framework for climate change response.

High-sulphur petroleum coke (HSPC), a significant byproduct of petroleum refining, has limited applications except as fuel for combustion. This study aims to expand its utility by investigating its efficacy as a reductant for disposing of Zn-containing dust, thereby substituting traditional coal-based reductants. The pyrolysis results showed that the gases generated from the pyrolysis of HSPC primarily comprised hydrogen gas (H 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), methane and carbon dioxide. The reductant gases H 2 and CO accounted for above 90% of the total pyrolysis gas at 1200 °C. The reduction reaction mechanism was elucidated by thermodynamic calculations and carbothermal experiments. At 800 °C, ZnFe 2 O 4 is gradually decomposed into Fe 3 O 4 , FeO and ZnO, and Fe 2 O 3 is completely reduced to Fe 3 O 4 . At 900–1000 °C, iron oxides are basically reduced to Fe, and ZnO is also reduced to Zn. Above 1100 °C, CaMgSiO 4 as a slag phase is generated due to the combination of CaO, MgO and SiO 2 . At 1200 °C, the roasting product with a metallic material is obtained, and the sulphur removal rate reaches 58%. This study provides valuable insights into the clean and efficient recovery and reuse of petroleum coke–coal, offering a promising avenue for sustainable resource management.

As the concrete industry continues to grapple with the challenge of reducing its carbon footprint, CO2 mineralization technologies offer a practical and scalable solution. These technologies enable the integration of CO2 as a valuable raw material, transforming waste emissions into durable mineral compounds during the concrete production process. This study investigates the implementation of CO2 mineralization in fresh concrete, analyzing its effects on key material properties such as strength and durability. Experimental results reveal that the process not only ensures equivalent compressive strength of concrete with a reduced cement content, but also contributes to reductions in embodied carbon compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the study underscores the role of this approach in supporting the industry's decarbonization efforts, aligning with global sustainability goals. The findings highlight CO2 mineralization as a pivotal step toward the creation of more sustainable construction materials, offering both environmental and economic benefits. These conclusions demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology in advancing the sustainability of concrete production while addressing the pressing demand for eco-friendly construction practices.

The capture and utilization of CO2 are critical for protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable development of society. Given the challenges in separating multiple C1 products with similar reduction potentials, achieving high selectivity for a single reduction product while maintaining high conversion efficiency is essential. In this study, a photocatalyst with NH2-MIL-125-Ti/Cu dual-metal active sites was developed by introducing Cu2+ in situ. The synergistic interaction between oxygen vacancies that capture CO2 and the Cu-Ti dual active sites formed by Cu-C-O-Ti intermediates preferentially facilitated the generation of CO. As a result, high CO selectivity was achieved during the CO2 photoreduction process. The experimental results indicate that NM-Cu5 achieves nearly 100% selectivity for CO under visible-light irradiation, with a CO2-to-CO conversion rate of 598.22 μmol g-1 h-1, representing a 108.28% improvement compared to NM. This study provides a novel strategy for designing and synthesizing more efficient and selective photocatalysts.

This study investigates the climatic response of the Arctic to key factors that could shape future climate scenarios: significantly reduced ice sheets, changes in vegetation, and elevated CO2 levels. Using the EC-Earth3.3 Earth system model (ESM), we explore the effects of these forcings under conditions reminiscent of the mid-Pliocene, a key reference for potential future warm climates. Our results reveal that the Arctic climate response varies significantly with different CO2 levels, primarily due to feedbacks involving sea ice and surface albedo. The effects of the reduced ice sheet are, in a pre-industrial CO2 environment (280 ppm), an Arctic warming of 2.4°C. This is driven by substantial sea ice loss in the Barents Sea, which reduces surface albedo. Surprisingly, at 400 ppm CO2, Arctic warming incurred from the ice sheet reduction is lower than expected, at 1.9°C, because sea ice loss is less pronounced compared to pre-industrial conditions, leading to smaller albedo changes. At 560 ppm, the warming is more substantial (2.9°C) but still less than expected, largely due to the already reduced sea-ice extent at this high CO2 level. Vegetation changes further modulate Arctic climate dynamics. At 400 ppm CO2, the expansion of needleleaf evergreen trees decreases surface albedo, adding an additional 0.5°C of warming. However, at 560 ppm CO2, the warming effect of vegetation growth was muted (0.3°C) due to the development of a more diverse canopy with brighter deciduous species, which mitigates the albedo-driven warming. Our findings underscore the complex interplay between CO2 levels, sea ice, and vegetation in determining in Arctic climate dynamics. They highlight that the importance of maintaining CO2 levels at or below 400 ppm to moderate Arctic warming effectively. This study emphasizes the value of integrating paleoclimate insights into future climate projections and underscores the need for a more detailed examination of feedback mechanisms to enhance the robustness of climate models.

Understanding how TiO2 interacts with CO2 at the molecular level is crucial in the CO2 reduction toward value-added energy sources. Here, we report in-situ observations of the CO2 activation process on the reduced TiO2(110) surface at room temperature using ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We found that oxygen vacancies (Vo) diffuse dynamically along the bridging oxygen (Obr) rows of the TiO2(110) surface under ambient CO2(g) environments. This physical phenomenon exclusively occurs when the oxygen abstracted upon CO2 dissociation instantly occupies the Vo sites of Obr rows on the TiO2(110), whereas the TiO2(110) surface without the Vo only allows CO2 physisorption on five-fold-coordinated Ti4+ sites. Synchrotron-based ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also identifies the changes in surface oxidation states of TiO2(110) by the healing of Vo sites or the CO2 physisorption under ambient CO2(g) conditions. Density functional theory calculations propose a mechanism of the CO2-driven Vo diffusion and the physisorbed CO2 configurations. Our combined results unravel the critical role of defect sites on TiO2 in determining the elementary step of CO2 activation during chemical reactions.

The materials constituting the pavement bodies, until today, have been limited to certain so-called noble materials (rolled sands, aggregates, etc.), but these are in the process of being exhausted under the effect of intensive exploitation and the scarcity of quality quarries. With the objective of preserving the deposits of aggregates in the process of exhaustion for future generations and of exploiting the aeolian sands in abundance in the regions of southern Algeria, we aim to enhance the latter in the body of the roadway mixed with the tuffs, this would imply a reduction in construction costs (use of local aggregates of lower quality available in large quantities, reduction in transport costs). From an environmental point of view, this would limit the impacts with a reduction in CO2 emissions linked to transport.

Abstract Elevated atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) often enhances plant photosynthesis and improves water status. However, the effects of e[CO2] vary significantly and are believed to be influenced by water availability. With the future warmer climate expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme rainfall, the response of plants to e[CO2] under changing precipitation patterns remains uncertain. We examined the effects of e[CO2] and different irrigation regimes on perennial ryegrass in a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. Immediately after irrigation, the mean net photosynthetic rate was 21.2% higher under e[CO2] compared to ambient conditions. This benefit increased over time, reaching 31.3% higher as days since watering increased, indicating a substantial increase in photosynthetic benefit with longer intervals between watering. Mean stomatal conductance was 21% lower in ryegrass under e[CO2] immediately after irrigation compared to ambient plots. However, the reduction in stomatal conductance under e[CO2] decreased as the interval between irrigation events increased, showing no difference 7-10 days after an irrigation event. These results imply that plants benefit most from carbon fertilisation, assimilating relatively more carbon and losing less water, during periods with less frequent rainfall. These findings have significant implications for understanding leaf-level responses to climate change.

The European Union’s path towards zero carbon dioxide emissions for new passenger vehicles necessitates a transitional period in which conventional vehicles coexist with zero-emission alternatives. This shift requires targeted strategies from engineers and policymakers, particularly in the area of road design, to reduce pollution. This study aims to investigate the environmental benefits of converting a two-lane urban roundabout into a turbo-roundabout through a virtual microsimulation approach using PTV VISSIM. The simulated model was calibrated and validated with real-world daily traffic data by properly adjusting the driving behavior parameters and comparing observed and modeled traffic volumes and queues. The Vehicle-Specific Power (VSP) emission method was applied to model, calculate and illustrate emissions by analyzing vehicle trajectories for the examined scenarios. Results show a statistically significant reduction in emissions for nearly all trips, with emissions decreasing by up to 44% across the intersection and its surrounding areas, and up to 23% at the intersection itself. Emissions are largely influenced by trip duration and traffic efficiency, both of which are enhanced by the improved geometric configuration of the case study intersection. These findings highlight that turbo-roundabouts represent an effective, environmentally sustainable design solution for urban intersections.

Agriculture faces significant challenges from environmental factors like drought, heat, waterlogging, cold, soil salinity, nutrient deficiency, and heavy metal contamination (Pathak, 2023). These stresses impair plant function, limiting growth and productivity. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of these stresses, food and nutrition security are at risk. Plants employ various tolerance mechanisms at molecular, biochemical, physiological, and morpho-anatomical levels, which vary by species and stress type (Rane et al., 2021). This editorial highlights promising research showcasing advanced understanding of plant responses to abiotic stresses. Through 14 publications (13 original research and 1 review) editorial covers various aspects of managing the emerging and future abiotic stresses through innovative G × E × M (genotype by environment by management) practices for improving the tolerance as well as adaptation and mitigation strategies for enhanced sustainability of crop production systems.Oat (Avena nuda L.) is a moderately salt-tolerant cereal crop, and understanding its salinity tolerance mechanisms can improve production in salt-affected areas. Liu et al. studied the salt tolerance of the naked oat line Bayou1, treating 17-day-old seedlings with varying NaCl concentrations for 12 days. Optimal growth was observed at 50 mM NaCl. Despite reduced water uptake and nutrient imbalances, Bayou1 maintained root growth, indicating roots play a key role in its salt tolerance through increased Na + concentrations in root cell sap while maintaining membrane integrity and osmotic potential.Azrai et al. applied machine learning (ML) to predict maize grain yield and stress tolerance index (STI) under normal and drought conditions. Thirty-five genotypes were evaluated across three sites, and ML models were optimized using genetic algorithms (GA) and ensemble methods. Results showed that ensemble models optimized by grid search had the best performance, with R 2 values of 0.92 for grain yield and 0.82 for STI. The Multi-trait Genotype-Ideotype Distance (MGIDI) approach accurately identified superior hybrids (H06, H10, H13, H35), highlighting the potential of ML and MGIDI in drought-tolerant maize breeding.Excess soil iron (Fe) toxicity is a major challenge for rice cultivation in acidic soils. Sonu et al. assessed sixteen rice genotypes under varying iron (Fe) levels to evaluate their responses to Fe toxicity, focusing on seedling root systems. Hydroponic screening identified 460 ppm Fe as a critical threshold, significantly affecting root traits and biomass. Genotypes were classified into tolerant and sensitive categories using leaf bronzing scores and a response stability index. Tolerant varieties, such as ILS 12-5, were identified, while popular varieties like BPT 5204 and Pusa 44 showed high sensitivity to Fe toxicity.Traditional rice monocropping in uplands is not environmentally sustainable and profitable. Pan et al. assessed the energy flow, carbon balance, and GWP of five monocropping systems (rice, finger millet, black gram, horse gram, pigeon pea) and four intercropping systems (rice+black gram, rice+horse gram, finger millet+black gram, finger millet+horse gram). Rice+black gram and rice+horse gram were the most energy-efficient, with better carbon efficiency and sustainability. Pigeon pea and finger millet+horse gram offered higher rice equivalent yields and benefit-cost ratios. Overall, pigeon pea and finger millet-based intercropping systems were the best options for eastern India's rainfed upland agro-ecosystem.High carbon losses in Mollisols pose a substantial challenge to food security and climate regulation. Liang et al. assessed fertilization strategies on crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, and carbon sequestration efficiency under climate change scenarios in Northeast China using the SPACSYS model. Higher temperatures reduced maize yield by 14.5% in Harbin and 13.3% in Gongzhuling, and soybean yield by 10.6%. SOC sequestration efficiency decreased with increased carbon input. Manure application resulted in higher carbon sequestration efficiency compared to other treatments, making it an effective practice for climate change mitigation in Mollisols.screened cowpea varieties for waterlogging tolerance by evaluating morphophysiological and root traits under 10 days of waterlogging stress at the seedling stage. Waterlogging reduced plant height, leaf area, chlorophyll content, and NDVI, but tolerant varieties like DC15 and PL4 exhibited increased adventitious root (AR) number and length. Correlation and PCA analyses revealed a positive link between AR formation/length and waterlogging tolerance, suggesting these traits as valuable markers for breeding waterloggingtolerant cowpeas.Smallholder maize farming in sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to drought, threatening food security and livelihoods. Ndlovu et al. mapped genomic regions associated with water stress tolerance in tropical maize using three F3 populations (753 families) evaluated in Kenya and Zimbabwe. High-density SNP markers identified 93 QTLs under well-watered and 41 under water-stressed conditions, with significant QTLs for grain yield, plant height, ear height, and anthesis-silking interval. These findings highlight the potential of genomic selection for improving maize breeding to enhance drought tolerance and support food security in sub-Saharan Africa.Drought is a major concern in chickpea breeding, controlled by multiple genes. Harish et al. examined 125 chickpea landraces from the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region, and 4 varieties, to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs) and candidate genes for drought tolerance. Thirteen physio-morphological traits were analyzed over two years at two locations, revealing strong correlations between seed yield and biological yield. Using genotypic data from 6,367 SNPs, 52 significant SNPs were identified, including genes related to drought tolerance such as GHR1, WAT1, and beta-galactosidase, which will aid in improving drought tolerance in chickpea breeding.Cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural soils is a global concern due to its harmful effects on human health. Iqbal et al. investigated the impact of vermicompost (VC) on soil properties, plant physiology, leaf ultrastructure, antioxidant defense, and rice yields under Cd stress. Results showed that Cd toxicity decreased soil quality, photosynthesis, and antioxidant activity, leading to lower rice yields. However, VC application improved soil health, enhanced physiological functions, and boosted antioxidant enzyme activities, reducing Cd uptake and alleviating oxidative damage. The treatment (50 mg Cd + 6 t ha -1 VC) significantly increased grain yields, highlighting potential of vermicompost towards sustainable rice production in Cd-contaminated soils.Climate change directly affects cotton yield by damaging morphological development and plant growth. Fan et al. used the AquaCrop model and 30 years of meteorological data to optimize irrigation and planting dates for cotton under limited water conditions. Results showed that higher irrigation quotas increased yield and biomass, with 495 mm achieving optimal water efficiency. Planting in late March to early April suits regions with abundant water, while late April to early May is better for water-scarce areas, using early-maturing varieties.Continuous drought stress threatens food security, yet crop responses remain uncertain. Cui et al. calibrated and validated the AquaCrop model using summer maize data from 2017-2018 to simulate growth under various drought scenarios. The model analyzed transpiration (Tr), biomass accumulation, and yield formation at two growth stages. Results showed that drought at the seedling stage significantly reduced transpiration and biomass, with severe drought during the seedling and jointing stages causing total yield loss. The study emphasized the importance of avoiding severe drought at these stages for sustainable maize yield.Chakrabarti et al. investigated the effects of elevated ozone (O3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) on rice productivity in northern India over two kharif seasons (2020)(2021). Using Free Air Ozone-Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FAOCE) rings, three rice varieties (Pusa Basmati 1121, Nagina 22, IR64 Drt1) were examined under varying nitrogen (N) management. Elevated O3 reduced photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration, resulting a 6.9-9% yield reduction. Elevated CO2 partially compensated for yield losses, particularly in Nagina 22. Additional N (125% RDN) improved grain N uptake under elevated O3 and CO2 conditions.Siddiqui investigated the effects of cypermethrin, a widely used synthetic pyrethroid, on growth, pollen morphology, fertility, and antioxidant activities in Cicer arietinum L. The exposure not only reduced plant height, branches, pods, seeds, and yield but also increased pollen wrinkling, reduced fertility, impacted chlorophyll and carotenoid content. Cypermethrin also affected hydrogen peroxide scavenging, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme activities in a dosedependent manner. These findings highlight the need for further research on the ecological and health risks of cypermethrin exposure.Rui et al. conducted a review on drought and heat stress in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) from 1994 to 2024 showcasing consistent publications from China and the USA. Keyword analysis revealed "growth," "endophytic fungi," and "yield" in drought studies, while "growth," "gene," and "leaf" were common in heat stress research. Most studies focused on phenotype, resistance mechanisms, and endophytes. The review emphasized the need for further molecular research on drought-heat stress interactions.Overall, this comprehensive range of research highlights the need for a multifaceted approach to understand the interactions and impacts of combined stresses, crucial for developing stresstolerant crops and devising mitigation strategies for various climatic challenges.

Renewable energy-driven electrochemical CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere-level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large-scale implementation of CO2 electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine-doped SnO2 nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three-dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO2 to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99% and a CO2 single-pass conversion rate of 93% at 2 A cm-2. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94% for 520 h at a current density of 3 A cm-2. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well-retained Sn4+ species and Sn-Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO2 conversion. The incorporation of chlorine into SnO2 enhances electron transport and CO2 adsorption, substantially lowering the reaction energy barrier for the crucial intermediate *OCHO formation, and boosting the formate production.

This study presents a refrigeration-based carbon capture system designed for shipboard integration, employing a modified reverse Brayton cycle to capture CO2 from turbine exhaust via desublimation. The system achieves CO2 capture by drying, compressing, cooling, and expanding exhaust gases to reach the temperatures required for CO2 desublimation, enabling efficient capture and storage of CO2 without complex chemical processes. The desublimation chamber, a central component, captures CO2 by phase change, allowing for streamlined storage and minimal energy footprint. A parametric analysis was conducted to assess the idealized performance of system components under varying exhaust gas compositions, compression ratios, and CO2 capture rates. Results indicate that desublimation temperature and cooling load requirements are strongly influenced by the initial exhaust gas CO2 concentrations, capture rates, and exhaust gas pressures. High capture rates require increased cooling loads and lowered desublimation temperatures, impacting overall system efficiency. Furthermore, the study introduces a comprehensive performance parameter that considers the balance between CO2 capture efficiency and energy demand, revealing an optimal threshold beyond which increased capture rates incur disproportionate energy penalties. This system meets the Navy's requirements for operational efficiency, waste heat recovery, and emissions reduction, offering a promising approach to sustainable shipboard operations.

The steel and fertilizer markets are predicted to grow in the decades to come, while they need to take actions to transform towards CO2 neutrality. These two industrial sectors are responsible for 30% of all industrial CO2 emission and >4% of annual global GDP (gross domestic product). In the H2020 INITIATE project, these two industrial sectors are coupled using a symbiosis approach: the steel works arising gasses are used as feedstock for the production of NH3 and urea. This directly contributes to the reduction of i) the CO2 emissions, ii) the energy requirement and iii) the raw material use. It concept shows that carbon capture, re-use and storage are sustained on the value generated for generation of added value products such as NH3 and urea. The roll-out of the concept is based on technology demonstration, for which the pilot plant construction nears completion, while the techno-economic and life-cycle assessments show the benefits in terms increased energy efficiency for CO2 removal, higher CO2 avoidance rates and lower costs for CO2 capture compared to amine-based reference cases. The burdens for climate change impact, damages to the eco-system as well as human life are significantly reduced compared to the reference cases. For the long term implementation plan, it is shown that the current positive business case has the potential to be further strengthened by the CBAM and ETS CO2 pricing mechanisms, although the related uncertainties are significant.

CO2‐based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace CO‐based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO2‐based hydroesterification is through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters. This route creates a net CO2‐based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate‐olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2‐bis(di‐tert‐butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO2, H2, methanol and 1‐octene in a single‐stage batch process. The CO2‐based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1‐octene reduction. Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two‐stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1‐octene, achieving a yield of up to 32%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to ca 75%. Preliminary studies indicate significant interplay between the two ligands employed in the molecular tandem catalytic systems and establish the first catalytic protocol for the selective CO2‐based hydroesterification of olefins via organoformates.

This study investigates the potential for emissions reductions in U.S. refineries through carbon capture technologies under various decarbonization scenarios. In 2019, the refining sector emitted over 220 million tons of CO2eq/year, primarily from fossil fuel combustion, with deep conversion refineries identified as the largest emitters. Using the Petroleum Refinery Lifecycle Inventory Model (PRELIM) and its integrated carbon capture module, the study evaluates emissions reduction strategies, incorporating future scenarios of transportation fuel demand, crude quality changes, and carbon pricing. Results indicate that declining fuel demand could reduce emissions by 51 million tons CO2 eq/year, while deploying carbon capture technologies under high demand scenarios could cut emissions by up to 126 million tons CO2 eq/year by 2035. By 2050, a combination of demand reduction and carbon capture could achieve a 77.4% reduction in annual emissions compared to 2019 levels. The Real Option Analysis highlights a 99.9% likelihood of hydroskimming refinery shutdowns by early 2030s, whereas medium and deep conversion refineries demonstrate resilience and are likely to adopt carbon capture early.

Permeability reduction due to salt precipitation near CO2 injection wells will reduce injectivity and may place the viability of large-scale CCS projects at risk of failure. Therefore, an understanding of the optimum injection conditions to mitigate the risk of deposition of halite and other salts is key. This study investigates the influence of continuous and intermittent CO2 injection on reservoir dynamics under two specific field conditions (one an offshore North Sea CCS project and the other an onshore North American project) by performing parametric sensitivity analyses.

Global warming is an urgent problem that must be solved immediately, and it is said that the cause is CO2 emitted by human activities. DAC is a technology that directly captures CO2 from the air and can contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere. The DAC technology is required to reduce the cost by making the equipment compact as much as possible, and to realize practical use with energy saving. KHI is developing DAC technology using solid adsorbent. The solid adsorbent is an amine impregnated porous material. Moving bed technology has been developed for CO2 capture from flue gas. Therefore, moving bed technology is applied to the DAC to make the equipment compact and save energy. In this paper, the energy superiority of the moving bed process over the fixed bed process was verified using the laboratory scale test facility.Steam was introduced into the solid adsorbent which sufficiently adsorbed CO2 to desorb CO2, and the energy consumption was evaluated from the temperature change of solid sorbent. As a result of 4 cycles of the desorption process, it was confirmed that the desorption energy of the moving bed process could be reduced by 34% compared with that of the fixed bed process. It is expected that the energy consumption of the actual moving bed process can be further reduced. The commercialization of the DAC technology will be accelerated by adopting this moving bed system for commercial plant.

Land Use Trade-offs under the 1.5°C Temperature Control Target: van and Haigh (2024) explored the land use competition situation under the 1.5°C climate stabilization scenario, proposed to jointly formulate strong policies and regulations to comprehensively promote the efficient use of land in fields such as food, energy, and nature conservation (doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2024.1379046).Precise Deconstruction of Natural Land Carbon Sinks: Qu et al. (2023) took the dominant position of forests in the absorption of carbon dioxide on land as the core basis, skillfully integrated the MIT carbon cycle model simulation with the Shell Energy Security Scenarios emission pathways, and constructed a precise analysis framework for national net-zero emission targets under different scenarios (https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1289531). In addition, there are also some new trends, such as digital empowerment to improve the emission reduction efficiency of resource-based cities: Qian & Luo (2024) found that digital transformation can significantly improve the land green use efficiency of resource-based cities through multiple paths such as driving technological innovation, promoting industrial structure upgrading, and alleviating the problem of land factor mismatch. (doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2024.1339928).Land systems possess both carbon sequestration and emission functions, and transitioning to carbon neutrality requires maintaining a delicate balance between these two roles. By making conscious and sustainable choices in land use, we can make significant progress in addressing climate change and creating a more resilient and low-carbon future for future generations.Protecting Natural Ecosystems: Improve the carbon storage capacity by protecting natural ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, farmlands and wetlands. This includes delimiting and managing ecological protection red lines and nature reserves to make effective use of the carbon sequestration capacity of natural ecosystems.Optimizing human activities space.: With the goal of low carbon emissions, the rational distribution of population and industries should be guided. By optimizing the quantitative structure and spatial pattern of land use, it will be beneficial to adjust the industrial layout, reduce the land use types mainly relying on fossil energy consumption, and improve energy utilization efficiency.Strengthening Land Use Regulation: Strictly control the expansion of construction land and deforestation to reduce carbon emissions from land use. It is crucial to monitor the carbon emissions and carbon emission intensity of major land use types and strengthen policy interventions in the process of carbon emissions from land use.Innovating Land Management Measures: Economic and policy incentives can be used to guide farmers to cultivate high-carbon sequestration crops, thereby increasing the carbon storage of farmland and grasslands.In general, this series of colorful, diverse, and in-depth studies in this issue reveals the complex relationships among land use, carbon emissions, and sustainable development. The various research results echo and closely connect with each other, just like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, jointly piecing together a magnificent blueprint for sustainable development. Achieving carbon neutrality and reaching peak emissions is a complex and long-term endeavor, with the dynamics of land use and carbon emissions being integral components of its success. Through measures such as scientific planning, rational layout, technological innovation, and policy guidance, we can promote a virtuous cycle between economic and social development and ecological environmental protection, contributing to the harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature.    

    

## PROSPECTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN ENERGY: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AS THE KEY TO REDUCING THE PRICE OF “GREEN” HYDROGEN

The article considers the prospects for the development of hydrogen energy, in particular, the application of hydrogen production technology based on water splitting using the latest electrolysis technologies. Particular attention is paid to the innovative methodology proposed by the Israeli company H2Pro, which promises a significant reduction in the cost of "green" hydrogen by 2030 to the level of less than $1 per kilogram. This reduction in hydrogen prices by 60-80% will make it more competitive in the energy market, which can lead to widespread adoption of hydrogen technologies in various sectors of the economy. The technology developed by H2Pro uses the E-TAC (Electrochemical Thermally Activated Chemical Water Splitting) method, which consists of a two-step process for the production of hydrogen and oxygen. The first stage involves cold electrochemical splitting of water, which generates hydrogen and oxidizes the anode, while the second stage, thermally activated, regenerates the anode by releasing oxygen, without the need for additional electricity consumption. This technology makes it possible to reduce energy costs and increase the efficiency of the process, reaching an efficiency of 95%, which is a significant achievement in the field of hydrogen energy. The author of the article also draws attention to the importance of this achievement for the global transition to renewable energy sources. In particular, reducing the cost of hydrogen production with the help of such technologies can provide cheaper energy production than traditional energy carriers such as gasoline and diesel, and also become a key factor in the implementation of ambitious environmental initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to technological innovation, the article also discusses the need for infrastructure development for the storage, transportation and use of hydrogen, which remains one of the main barriers to its large-scale use. However, thanks to the efforts of companies such as H2Pro, which are actively working on improving production processes and reducing costs, hydrogen energy has a great chance of becoming an integral part of the energy system of the future. Thus, the development of hydrogen energy technologies, such as E-TAC, is an important step on the way to ensuring a clean and sustainable energy supply, which will contribute to reducing the environmental impact and ensuring the sustainable development of the world economy in the face of global climate change.

The purpose of this research article is to perform a greenhouse gas (GHG) impact assessment using a lifecycle analysis of a cold-ironing solution for vessels at anchorage in a retrofitted barge and a marine genset combusting biomethane in dual fuel mode. A lifecycle methodology is developed based on the 4th International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG study. Eleven impact scenarios are evaluated in terms of CO2 and harmful pollutants (SOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, NMVOC, and NOx). Vessels operated by Petronav Ship Management Ltd are examined, specifically M/T Alexandria and M/T Astraia. The scenarios reveal CO2 reductions of up to 21% and CO increases of up to 60% due to the combustion of biomethane in dual fuel mode, alongside SOx reductions of up to 20% with increasing biomethane energy substitution. Particulates and NOx decrease due to the utilization of biomethane. This article presents a pragmatic solution for cold ironing for vessels at anchorage with proven lower GHG emissions with the exception of increased CO emissions, therefore the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

Due to the limited availability of medical facilities and the urgency and irreplaceability of medical-seeking behaviors, the transportation processes used to access these resources inherently result in high carbon emissions. Unfortunately, pediatric medical facilities are among the least substitutable destinations, making it challenging to reduce travel-related CO2 emissions by traditional means such as decreasing travel frequency or optimizing transportation means. This study proposes enhancing the spatial allocation of pediatric medical facilities to effectively reduce travel-related CO2 emissions. This study selects 27 hospitals with pediatric departments in Tianjin as the research subject. It introduces a model for measuring travel-related CO2 emissions for pediatric medical-seeking, STIRPAT, and ridge regression models as well as conducts simulations under various scenarios to test the hypotheses. Therefore, methods for enhancing the spatial allocation of pediatric medical facilities are proposed. The results show that (1) travel-related CO2 emissions for pediatric medical-seeking are the highest in the city center, outpatient-related CO2 emissions surpass inpatient ones, and children’s hospital-related CO2 emissions are higher than those related to comprehensive hospitals, from which potential carbon reduction points can be explored; (2) children’s hospitals with multibranch and composite functional allocations can significantly reduce CO2 emissions; (3) comprehensive hospitals can further alleviate CO2 emissions from children’s hospitals by enhancing the medical level, transportation infrastructure, population distribution, and other spatial environmental factors; (4) from the perspective of low-carbon travel and equity, a spatial allocation strategy should be adopted for children’s hospitals that includes multiple branches and composite functions, while comprehensive hospitals should focus on service capacity, parity, supply–demand ratio, and the population density of children.

This study examines corn stalk biochar (CSB)-enhanced mortar as an innovative material for carbon capture and CO2 sequestration. CSB, a renewable agricultural byproduct, was incorporated into cement mortar at varying concentrations (2.5% to 75%), and its effects on the mortar’s physicochemical properties, its ability to support algal growth, and the CO2 absorption capacity of the algae were analyzed. Characterization of CSB showed a high carbon content (62.3%), significant porosity, and a large surface area (680.3 m2 g−1), making it ideal for gas capture. At low concentrations (2.5%), CSB slightly improved the mortar’s compressive strength and density. However, higher CSB levels (5% to 75%) led to significant reductions (p < 0.05) in strength and density, while water absorption increased. CO2 sequestration monitored from algal growth studies revealed that both Chlorella sp. (TISTR 8262) and Scenedesmus sp. (TISTR 9384) thrived on CSB-enhanced mortars. At a 75% CSB concentration, Scenedesmus sp. achieved a 24.2-fold increase in biomass by day 12, outperforming Chlorella sp., which showed a 26.6-fold increase. CO2 absorption also improved with biochar. Mortars with 75% CSB achieved an 86% CO2 absorption ratio without algae, while adding algae boosted this to nearly 100%, highlighting the synergistic effect of biochar and algal photosynthesis. Higher CSB levels accelerated CO2 absorption stabilization, reaching saturation by day 8 at 75% CSB. Scenedesmus sp. showed slightly higher CO2 absorption efficiency than Chlorella sp., reaching peak absorption earlier and maintaining greater efficiency. Higher CSB concentrations accelerated CO2 absorption, indicating that biochar–mortar mixtures, particularly when combined with algae, provide a promising solution for enhancing carbon capture and sequestration in green infrastructure.

Evidence is growing that insects may feel pain, suggesting that the precautionary use of pain reduction methods like anesthesia may be an important refinement for these species in laboratory research. Given that anesthetic use is not mandated for insects in research, this review aimed to determine if and how modern researchers working with ten model insect species use anesthetic agents. We searched Google Scholar for all papers published on each model species that contained a mention of anesthesia from 2019-2024; then, we confirmed whether anesthesia was used for putative pain reduction/loss of consciousness purposes in a laboratory setting (n = 93). Papers that met these criteria were found for five species: the western honey bee (n = 8), the migratory locust (n = 4), the house cricket (n = 3), the black soldier fly (n = 3), and the fruit fly (n = 75). Cold or freezing was reported for all five species; isoflurane, sevoflurane, carbon dioxide, desflurane, halothane, flyNap (triethylamine), dyclonine, etomidate, ketamine, 2,6-diisopropyl phenol, propofol, tricaine mesylate, chloroform, xenon, eugenol, alcohol, ether, and nitrogen gas were reported for a subset of species (with the vast majority of variance in anesthetic choice resulting from the fruit fly literature). The majority of studies did not report exposure procedure, anesthetic dose or exposure time; when reported, these details varied widely, suggesting a lack of standardization in anesthesia protocols among insect researchers that may harm reproducibility. Further, 24.4% of studies reported the use of an anesthetic (cold) not recommended by invertebrate veterinarians, suggesting a lack of integration between the insect research and veterinary communities on refining experimental procedures. Overall, our review suggests there is a need to develop standardized, species-specific anesthesia protocols that improve scientific reproducibility and support welfare in model insects.

Importance There is growing awareness of the US health sector’s substantial contribution to the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exacerbating the health threats from climate change. Reducing health care’s environmental impact requires understanding its carbon emissions, but there are few published audits of health systems and fewer comprehensive emissions analyses at the clinic or department level. Objective To quantify the annual GHG emissions from a large outpatient dermatology practice, compare relative sources of emissions, and identify actionable targets. Design and Setting This quality improvement study involving a comprehensive carbon footprint analysis (scopes 1-3) of a large (nearly 30 000 visits/y), outpatient medical dermatology practice within the University of Pennsylvania’s academic medical complex was conducted following the GHG Protocol Corporate and Corporate Value Chain reporting standards for fiscal year 2022 (ie, July 2021 through June 2022). Data were obtained through energy metering, manual audits, electronic medical records, and administrative data. Exposure Data were converted into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e), allowing comparison of global-warming potential of emitted GHGs. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were tCO 2 e by scope 1 (direct emissions), scope 2 (indirect, purchased energy), and scope 3 (indirect, upstream/downstream sources), as well as by individual categories of emission sources within each scope. Results Scope 3 contributed most to the clinic’s carbon footprint, composing 165.5 tCO 2 e (51.1%), followed by scope 2 (149.9 tCO 2 e [46.3%]), and scope 1 (8.2 tCO 2 e [2.5%]). Within scope 3, the greatest contributor was overall purchased goods and services (120.3 tCO 2 e [72.7% of scope 3]), followed by patient travel to and from the clinic (14.2 tCO 2 e [8.6%]) and waste (13.1 tCO 2 e [7.9%]). Steam and chilled water were the largest contributors to scope 2. Clinic energy use intensity was 185.4 kBtu/sqft. Conclusions and Relevance In this quality improvement study, the composition of emissions at the clinic level reflects the importance of scope 3, paralleling the health sector overall. The lower-resource intensity of the clinic compared to the average energy requirements of the total clinical complex led to a relatively large contribution from scope 2. These findings support efforts to characterize high-yield emissions-reduction targets and allow for identification of actionable, clinic-level steps that may inform broader health system efforts.

The injection of pulverized coal into blast furnaces has alleviated the demand for metallurgical coke, and co-injection technology combining natural gas and pulverized coal with high oxygen enrichment has the potential to further reduce coke use and hence CO2 emissions. This work presents a steady-state operational model for the co-injection of natural gas and pulverized coal into blast furnaces developed based on mass and energy balance. With the support of industrial data from the commercial blast furnace, the matching relationship between natural gas rate, pulverized coal injection rate, and oxygen enrichment is quantitatively examined under the constraints of raceway adiabatic flame temperature and top gas temperature. The effect of natural gas rate on coke rate and CO2 emission reduction is investigated. The results show that increasing natural gas injection rate, lower pulverized coal rate and higher oxygen enrichment maintains a constant raceway adiabatic flame temperature and coke rate. Under the optimal operating conditions, the pulverized coal, coke rate, and CO2 emissions are reduced by 30.2%, 7.3% and 6.2%, respectively. The model and its results are expected to be helpful for a better understanding co-injection of natural gas and pulverized coal into blast furnaces, as well as contribute to reducing coke rate, pulverized coal rate, and CO2 emissions.

This study aimed to determine the effects of elevated carbon dioxide (eCO 2 ) and temperature (eT) on the phytochemical and nutritional parameters of legumes. Field experiments were conducted using black gram ( Vigna mungo L.), green gram ( Vigna radiate L.), and pigeonpea ( Cajanus cajan L.) genotypes under the Free Air Temperature Elevation (FATE) facility, with three treatments (Ac, eT, and eCO 2 + eT) at ICAR-CRIDA, Hyderabad. The results revealed that the negative impact on both phytochemical and nutritional quality was greater under eT compared to eCO 2 + eT. Specifically, protein content decreased by 25.6% under eT + eCO 2 , while the ash content increased by 38.19%. Carbohydrate levels also decreased by 5.53% under these conditions . The reduction in micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu) was more pronounced than in macronutrients (P, Ca, and Mg) across the three crops. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the major contributors to PC1 were Mg, crude fiber, cooking time, phosphorus, hydration capacity, ash content, and Mn. The primary contributors to PC2 included swelling capacity, Cu, Mn, carbohydrate, hydration capacity, and Zn. In contrast, the major contributors to PC3 were Ca, Fe, Zn, protein, carbohydrate, swelling index, and ash content. The eigenvalues of principal components, calibrated through different parameters, ranged from 1.052 to 4.755 in black gram and from 1.073 to 6.267 in green gram. This study provides insights into nutritional quality under changing global climate conditions.

Concrete production, heavily reliant on Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), is a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions, responsible for about 8% of human-related emissions. While past efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of cement focused on improving energy efficiency and incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), recent innovations have shifted towards low-carbon binders like calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement, limestone calcined clay (LC3) cement, and geopolymers. These alternatives offer considerable reductions in CO2 emissions during production. However, the adoption of these materials faces challenges, particularly in 3D-printed concrete (3DPC), an emerging construction method that demands specific rheological and mechanical properties. Research into these low-carbon binders shows that CSA cement provides rapid strength development, LC3 mixtures offer promising environmental benefits and structural integrity, and geopolymers achieve high compressive strength but require optimization for durability. This study summarizes a review of the effects of these binders on the fresh properties, mechanical performance, and durability of concrete, emphasizing their potential for use in 3DPC. The findings underscore the importance of optimizing material properties for enhanced performance and sustainability in the construction industry.

Introduction Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are emerging treatment options. This study aimed to estimate the potential health system and associated environmental impacts of DMTs by modeling future bed-days and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions for the UK population under various scenarios for access to and efficacy of DMTs. Methods A cohort Markov model was developed to predict the UK population distribution from 2020 to 2040 across five health states—cognitively unimpaired and four stages of AD (mild cognitive impairment, and mild, moderate, severe dementia). These distributions were estimated using national population projections, AD prevalence data, and stage-specific transition rates. Annual bed-days per person for each state and associated CO 2 e emissions from published literature were applied to estimate total bed-days and emissions. Modeled scenarios combined ranges of DMT efficacy estimates (20 to 30%) and access levels (25 to 58% eligible patients receiving treatment) elicited from expert opinion to explore the extent of potential DMT impacts. Results Without DMT access, annual bed-days across the four AD stages were projected to increase from 5.5 million to 8.6 million from 2020 to 2040, with cumulative bed-days totaling 140 million. Associated annual emissions increased from 0.7 Mt to 1.1 Mt CO 2 e, reaching 17 Mt CO 2 e cumulatively from 2020 to 2040. Under the various high-access (58% eligible patients treated) DMT efficacy scenarios, relative to no DMT access, annual reductions of 430 thousand to 650 thousand bed-days and 54 kt to 81 kt CO 2 e were estimated by 2040, and cumulative emissions decreased by 419 kt to 633 kt CO 2 e. Decreasing DMT access to 25 percent, assuming 25 percent DMT efficacy, reduced annual bed-days by 230 thousand by 2040, and annual emission savings decreased to 29 kt CO 2 e. Conclusions DMTs for AD may contribute to efforts by healthcare systems to reduce the carbon emissions from hospital inpatient care. Environmental sustainability should be considered as part of a holistic value proposition when assessing the benefits of new medicines.

The global rising temperatures has been a climate crisis and needs an urgent significant reduction of CO2 emission. The government of Canada has set the target for net-zero emission by 2050. Along with approaching utilizing renewable energy sources, the usage of fossil fuel is still inevitable for major industries such as power generation and steel. Among all techniques with the potential of achieving the goal, the approach of storing CO2 safely in the geological subsurface is essential for permanent removal of the CO2 from the atmosphere. This concept is well-known as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to remove a huge volume of emitted CO2 from the industries 'flue stack. Geological characterization is the key factor for finding a safe location with the proper geological features to store the captured CO2. Saskatchewan has been the home of the first commercial deep CCS project in Storing CO2 from Unit 3 of the Boundary Dam Carbon Capture facility at SaskPower, Estevan, Saskatchewan. Since April 2015, 580,000 tonnes of CO2 have been stored at the Aquistore site to the Deadwood Formation saline aquifer. This real-life project has shown the complete confidence in the geological proprieties of the formation. Western Canadian Sedimentary basin (WCSB) overlies all southern Saskatchewan. The thickness of the sediments is over 2-3 km in the Williston sub-basin from central Saskatchewan to the south. Williston basin is a geologically unique basin comprised of "Pre-Cambrian basement". Two major aquifers of Deadwood and Winnipeg Formations which are called "Basal Clastic Unit" almost completely cover Williston Basin in Saskatchewan. These two formations have given Saskatchewan a remarkable geological superiority. This study focuses on taking advantage of the same formation for having a CO2 injection well at the central Saskatchewan. The targeted spot is between Regina and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The top of the Winnipeg Formation at this spot reaches 2062 m while the thickness of Deadwood Formation in the Basal Clastic Unit is about 152 m. The model is built for the area of 55 ×15 km to include as many as well data available surrounding the target location. The formations maps were exported from the Saskatchewan Geological Mapping. There are injection wells in the studied area where their well log data (geoSCOUT) were helped to import the formations properties including porosity into the model. The radius of CO2 migration at the perforated section of the well for the total injection of 5-10 tonnes/day was studied and predicted over 25 years by considering the effect of continuous water injection from the surrounding wells to the same formation. The results showed that the maximum distance of the CO2 migration is about 500 m. The outcome is assuring the efficiency of CO2 storage for this particular location in the central of Saskatchewan province. Besides, it can give enough confidence to think about having CO2 storage hub for this part of the province with the great history and lessons learnt we have from the Aquistore injection well.    

    

## Significance of the Joule-Thomson Cooling Effect for Geological CO2 Storage in Depleted Gas Reservoirs

Depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs are often considered as suitable candidates for geological CO2 storage due to their proven injectivity (e.g., permeability and thickness), known storage capacity (e.g., pore volume), and established containment characteristics (e.g., presence of geological cap rocks). In addition, they offer existing injection infrastructures and comprehensive information from the geological formations that will be targeted for the CO2 storage operation. However, the injection of CO2 at high pressure into such low-pressure reservoirs is affected by the well-known Joule-Thomson cooling effect. The expansion of high-pressure CO2 into a depleted reservoir results in a localized temperature reduction in the wellbore region. This significant cooling effect may induce thermal fractures within the reservoir and cap rock; it can freeze the irreducible water, lead to formation of hydrates, and result in salt precipitation. While induced fractures can benefit the well injectivity, they might pose a risk to the integrity of the wellbore and the containment of reservoir. Additionally, formation of hydrates due to temperature drop near well may lead to the wellbore blockage, permeability reduction, and ultimately, injectivity impairment. Therefore, understanding the Joule-Thomson effect and associated parameters that can affect the degree of cooling in the near-wellbore region is crucial prior to the design phase of any CO2 injection projects into depleted reservoirs.In this study, we employ the TOUGH2-ECO2M simulation tool to assess the significance of the Joule-Thomson cooling effect in underground CO2 storage. Initially, the simulation model was verified using a classic Joule-Thomson expansion experiment with pure CO2, yielding its coefficients with less than 3% difference against the available published references and experimental data. This provided confidence in our analysis to perform further investigation of complex interplay between injected CO2 and reservoir dynamics. Key parameters, including injection rate, bottomhole temperature, reservoir permeability, and initial reservoir pressure, were studied to understand how these factors would influence the strength of the Joule-Thomson cooling effect in depleted gas reservoirs.In practice, the bottomhole temperature depends on various parameters, including the injection rate, well depth, wellhead temperature, tubing properties, and the geothermal gradient. In the current simulation, the wellbore flow is not explicitly modelled, and therefore, it is treated as a variable parameter. The impact of permeability and injection rate is examined independently in a sensitivity analysis. Despite their analogous influence on pressure drop, as dictated by Darcy's law, it is essential to recognize that alterations in temperature can make changes in the viscosity of CO2, subsequently exerting an indirect influence on the pressure drop within the system and amount of cooling effect.Simulation results indicated that more pronounced cooling can be experienced due to higher injection rate, lower reservoir permeability, elevated bottomhole temperature, or lower reservoir pressure. Interestingly, the bottomhole temperature drop near the wellbore exhibited notable behaviour. It deviated significantly from the theoretically calculated values, which is due to the residual heat from the underground formations. Temperature drop occurred gradually over time, and it was extended beyond the immediate wellbore region, propagating deep into the reservoir.To further explore the impact of bottomhole temperature on the Joule-Thomson cooling effect, we assumed a base case scenario in which the injection bottomhole temperature was equal to the initial reservoir temperature of 75 °C and reservoir initial pressure was 50 bars. Simulation results indicated that a maximum observed temperature-drop of 28 °C was caused by the Joule-Thomson cooling effect. In another scenario, the bottomhole temperature (20 °C) was significantly lower than the initial reservoir temperature (75 °C). In this case, the observed temperature drop due to the Joule-Thomson effect was only 4 °C. A comparison of these scenarios suggests that when CO2 is injected at lower temperature than reservoir temperature, the Joule-Thomson cooling effect would likely not promote formation of hydrates.While Joule-Thomson cooling effect may present other challenges (e.g., induced fractures), based on the current simulation results it does not seem to pose significant concerns regarding hydrate formation in the context of underground CO2 storage. This study is of significant practical considerations for the design of effective CO2 injection strategies into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs.

ConspectusSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) represent a transformative advancement in heterogeneous catalysis, offering unparalleled opportunities for maximizing atomic efficiency and enhancing performance. SACs are characterized by isolated metal atoms uniformly dispersed on suitable supports, ensuring each metal atom serves as an independent catalytic site. This dispersion mitigates metal atom aggregation, a common issue in conventional nanocatalysts, thus enabling superior activity, selectivity, and stability. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as an ideal platform for SAC synthesis due to their structural diversity, tunable coordination environments, and high surface areas. MOFs provide well-defined coordination sites that facilitate the precise stabilization of single metal atoms, presenting significant advantages over traditional supports like metal oxides and metal materials. Carbonization of MOFs yields MOF-derived carbon materials that retain key structural characteristics while offering enhanced electrical conductivity and stability, making them suitable for various catalytic applications.Recent advances in the rational design and controlled synthesis of MOF-derived SACs have significantly improved their performance in electrocatalytic processes such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, challenges remain, including maintaining structural integrity during high-temperature carbonization, enhancing mass and electron transport and ensuring the stability of isolated metal atoms under reaction conditions. To address these challenges, strategies such as using structure-directing agents to stabilize MOF frameworks, forming high-energy porous carbon networks, and optimizing support morphologies have been developed to maximize active site exposure and accessibility. On the other hand, the interplay between active metal sites and their coordination environments is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity of SACs. Advanced computational modeling, coupled with experimental validation, has provided insights into the electronic structure of SACs and the interactions between metal atoms and supports. These insights have enabled researchers to fine-tune local atomic coordination, leading to significant enhancements in performance. For instance, modifying the coordination environment of metal atoms optimizes the binding strength of reaction intermediates, thereby improving both activity and selectivity. This account highlights our group's contributions to MOF-derived SACs, focusing on innovative design, functionalization, and synthesis approaches that enhance catalytic activity. Notable strategies include using structure-directing agents to maintain pore connectivity during carbonization, preserving high surface areas, and enhancing mass transport. We also discuss the design of high-energy MOF-derived porous carbon networks that facilitate continuous electron transport and improve the interaction between active sites and reactants, ultimately boosting catalytic efficiency. Techniques such as electrospinning have also been employed to create hierarchical porous structures and one-dimensional nanofibers, enhancing mass transport and electron transfer. The rational design of SACs requires a comprehensive understanding of the microenvironment surrounding active sites, and by leveraging computational and experimental tools, researchers can precisely control these microenvironments to achieve desired outcomes.MOF-derived SACs hold substantial promise for energy conversion and chemical synthesis. Continued research is essential to optimize their design, improve scalability, and explore new applications, ultimately advancing sustainable catalysis. This account provides an overview of the latest advancements in MOF-derived SACs, highlighting their potential as next-generation electrocatalysts and their role in sustainable energy technologies.

Power plants are one of the main sources emitting the CO2 that is responsible for climate change consequences. Post-combustion carbon capture (PCC), particularly using an aqueous solution, is highly recommended to be used as a mitigation solution to reduce the emissions of CO2 from power plants. Although PCC is a promising solution, the process still needs further development to reduce the energy demand for solvent regeneration. This paper reviews the challenges related to the post-combustion processes and finds the correlations between selected variables addressed by several researchers. Moreover, this study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the reduction in energy demand and efficiency penalties. The research findings highlight the importance of considering two key drivers during the design of the PCC process. These are the absorber temperature and the type and amount of the selected solvent. Indeed, statistical analyses show that there is a correlation between the identified drivers’ values and the energy demand of solvent regeneration.

The benefits of CO₂ shipping transport within international Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) networks have been growing in importance as it offers flexibility and allows to postpone investment in capital-intensive infrastructure until enough CCS projects are launched. This work explores this value through a comparative cost assessment of 15 what-if scenarios devised for standalone and integrated CCS networks, designed around the Northern Lights project and the UK's Teesside cluster. The analysis is performed by implementing a Multi-period, Multi-mode, and Multi-objective Mixed integer linear programming (MoMilp) model developed at Imperial College London and considering all the elements of the CCS value chain after CO2 is captured (i.e. conditioning, intermediate storage and injection in the saline aquifer), allowing to account for individual regional characteristics in terms of design and network costs. The configurations of the different scenarios are used to analyse the implications of CCS network development hold up, e.g. for a part of the network to become available at a later period, or for the CO2 emission growth to occur at a later time in the planning horizon. The simulation results illustrate the interplay between postponing CCS network infrastructure investment and generating gains of scale in an existing network. This flexibility between CCS networks could provide relevant cost reduction while maximising the storage of CO2.

High deuteration yields are difficult to attain with conventional chemical synthesis methods. In this work, we demonstrate that deuterated chemicals can be produced using electrochemical CO2 reduction in the presence of D2O. The absence of H2O enables deuteration yields over 99% for products such as ethanol-d6 and formate-d. With a D2O solvent, the competing D2 evolution reaction is completely suppressed at low current densities while being kept <10% at a higher 300 mA/cm2.

Shale oil, a critical unconventional energy resource, has received substantial attention in recent years. However, systematic research on developing shale oil using mixed gases remains limited, and the effects of various gas compositions on crude oil and rock properties, along with their potential for enhanced oil recovery, are not yet fully understood. This study utilizes PVT analysis, SEM, and core flooding tests with various gas mixtures to elucidate the interaction mechanisms among crude oil, gas, and rock, as well as the recovery efficiency of different gas types. The results indicate that increasing the mole fraction of CH4 substantially raises the oil saturation pressure, up to 1.5 times its initial value. Pure CO2, by contrast, exhibits the lowest saturation pressure, rendering it suitable for long-term pressurization strategies. CO2 shows exceptional efficacy in reducing interfacial tension, though the viscosity reduction effects of different gases exhibit minimal variation. Furthermore, CO2 markedly modifies the pore structure of shale through dissolution, increasing porosity by 2% and enhancing permeability by 61.63%. In both matrix and fractured cores, the recovery rates achieved with mixed gases were 36.9% and 58.6%, respectively, demonstrating improved production compared to single-component gases. This research offers a theoretical foundation and novel insights into shale oil development.

Intermediate temperature (IT) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) development is hindered by slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and poor CO2 tolerance at the cathode electrode. Here, we present a successful synthesis of a composite cathode material consisting of double perovskite structure Sr2CoNbO6−δ (SCNO) and fluorite structure Sm0.2Ce0.8O2−δ (SDC), using one-pot synthesis method. Integrating SDC to form a composite SCNO–SDC substantially augments the number of active sites, resulting in high ORR activity and lower polarization resistance. Forming a tight, coherent interface structure between SCNO and SDC particles is advantageous in reducing the thermal expansion coefficient and significantly improving the oxygen ion transport by creating a 3D pathway through the self-assembled growth of SDC particles. At 700 °C, the SOFC (full cell) utilizing SCNO–SDC composite cathode exhibits a peak power density (PPD) of 0.786 W cm–2, surpassing the PPD of 0.602 W cm–2 attained by the SCNO alone. Furthermore, upon exposure to CO2, SCNO–SDC demonstrated remarkable performance recovery and tolerance. This study offers insights into the cathode material functioning of IT-SOFCs with enhanced electrochemical performance and long-term stability.

Thailand has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, targeting the power generation sector, which contributes 35% of the country’s CO2 emissions, as a critical area for intervention. This study explores the transition toward carbon neutrality in power generation, focusing on fossil-fuel-based plants, particularly lignite and natural gas, which remain central to Thailand’s electricity production. A key strategy adopted by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is “Sink Co-creation”, which includes the deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies in existing and future lignite power plants, leveraging favorable storage conditions. Additionally, natural gas power plants exhibit significant CCS potential through source–sink matching mechanisms. This study finds that the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from fossil-fuel-based power plants could reach 17.07 MtCO2. Of this total, lignite power plants are projected to achieve a reduction of 3.79 MtCO2 by 2036, while natural gas power plants are expected to contribute an additional 13.28 MtCO2 in reductions by 2050. However, the realization of these reductions faces significant challenges, including the high costs associated with CCS implementation and limited investor interest, underscoring the critical need for sustained government support and policy incentives to facilitate progress toward carbon neutrality.

Recent estimates put the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and Ethereum at an average of 64 and 26 million tonnes of CO2 per year, respectively. To address this growing problem, several possible approaches have been proposed in the literature: creating alternative blockchain consensus mechanisms, applying redundancy reduction techniques, utilizing renewable energy sources, and employing energy-efficient devices, etc. In this paper, we follow the second avenue and propose an efficient approach based on reinforcement learning that improves the block broadcasting scheme in blockchain networks. The analysis and experimental results confirmed that the proposed improvement of the block propagation scheme could cleverly handle network dynamics and achieve better results than the default approach. Additionally, our technical integration of the simulator and developed RL environment can be used as a complete solution for further study of new schemes and protocols that use RL or other ML techniques.

This paper presents a flexible heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modeling framework developed for building digital twin implementation. The framework is showcased for the modeling and simulation of four ventilation systems in a 8500 m2 university building. The developed model includes multiple objective model predictive control (MPC) with three objectives: electricity cost, indoor air quality and CO2 emission attributed to electricity consumption. A control strategy comparison is conducted between several MPC solutions with different objective weightings and a rule-based control strategy, which emulates the current system control. A novel approach for air quality evaluation is proposed and used for the MPC modeling and strategy comparison in this study. In this comparison, a “balanced” MPC strategy reduces energy costs by 18% compared to rule-based control while also providing significantly better air quality. An economic strategy achieves 24% savings with some air quality reduction, while an air-quality-focused strategy provides nearly “perfect” air quality with 11% savings. Finally, an environmental strategy shows the potential for prioritizing CO2 emissions over electricity costs. In this way, the strategy comparison illustrates the potential of MPC for the efficient operation and flexible objective prioritization according to stakeholder interests.

Energy shortage and greenhouse gas emission have become bottlenecks in current society development. Improving the efficiency of energy conversion and utilization systems through waste heat recovery and reduction of greenhouse gas through CO2 capture/conversion are important solutions. Both can be achieved simultaneously by utilizing high-temperature flue gas or CO2 in flue gas for organic matter gasification, which is called the flue gas chemical recuperative cycle. This paper provides a meaningful review of the latest advancements in the flue gas chemical recuperative cycle system, focusing on its application in diverse gasification systems for organic matters such as methane, sludge, etc. Additionally, this paper reviews methods for the integration of flue gas gasification into energy conversion and utilization systems under the application scenarios of gas turbine flue gas, air combustion flue gas, and oxy-fuel combustion flue gas. Subsequently, in order to improve the conversion efficiency of the chemical recuperative cycle, the applications of emerging gasification technologies in the field of the flue gas recuperative cycle, such as microwave gasification, plasma gasification, etc., are briefly summarized, offering an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms by which new methods enhance the process. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the field are discussed, and a comprehensive outlook is provided to guide future research.

Solar energy is an important energy sector that plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse emission in different industrial sectors, including the leather sector, to control the pollution. Stringent environmental regulations of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in Indian tanneries are implemented as directed by regulatory authorities. The ZLD system resulted in the generation of saline rejected from membrane systems being evaporated by spending considerable energy. In this paper, the potential of solar energyfor evaporation of reject from ZLD in a closed accelerated solar dryer has been investigated. In this study, the evaporation of reject/ saline water using a solar dryer with different volumes has been experimented and the volume reduction and increase in Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are monitored during the drying period. It is evident that the closed accelerated solar dryer has shown an increase in evaporation rate with reduction in the volume of water in a given area. The outcome of this study would lead to avoidance of mechanical evaporators in case of smaller capacity ZLD plants and also reduce the amount of water to be evaporated in the Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) in case of larger ZLD plants. By the application of the accelerated solar dryer for the evaporator, the potential CO2 emission reduction due to replacement of different fuels used for evaporation of reject has been estimated to reduce the carbon footprint and to ensure the sustainability of the leather industry.

In patients with acute brain injury (ABI), optimizing cerebral perfusion parameters relies on multimodal monitoring. This include data from systemic monitoring–mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2 ), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ), hemoglobin levels (Hb), and temperature–as well as neurological monitoring–intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities. We hypothesized that these parameters alone were not sufficient to assess the risk of cerebral ischemia. We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of patients admitted in our ICU between 2015 and 2021. Patients with ABI and multimodal neuromonitoring were included. ABI included traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The relationship between jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO 2 ) and cerebral perfusion parameters was analyzed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on SjvO 2 , with a threshold of 60% used to define cerebral ischemia. We compared the parameters used to optimize cerebral perfusion between groups and their diagnosis accuracy for cerebral ischemia was evaluated. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association between the guideline-recommended therapeutic targets and the risk of cerebral ischemia. 601 evaluations from 96 patients with simultaneous ICP, SjvO 2 and TCD were analyzed. Poor relationships were found between SjvO 2 and the parameters of cerebral perfusion. TCD flow velocities and PaCO 2 were lower in the cerebral ischemia group while MAP, ICP and CPP were not different between groups. Most ischemic episodes occurred despite ICP < 22 mmHg and CPP ≥ 60 mmHg. For the diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, only TCD parameters and PaCO 2 were associated with an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.5 but with a low accuracy. In multivariable analysis, the only guideline-recommended therapeutic target associated with a reduction of cerebral ischemia was a diastolic flow velocity (FV) > 20 cm.s −1 .

The recovery of natural resources has become a major challenge; in recent years, many economic players have focused on reusing herb residues to formulate a new generation of innovative eco-friendly construction materials. In this study, the incorporation of Needle Grass Residue powder (NGP) derived from crushing herb that originates from the "stipa tenacissima Plant as a partial replacement for coarse aggregates in the precast concrete was explored to assess its economic, environmental, mechanical, and physical impacts. Various NGP replacement levels (0%, 10%, 25%, and 50%) were analyzed. Economic assessments showed a significant reduction in concrete production costs with increasing NGP content, indicating potential cost savings. Environmentally, NGP's addition contributed to substantial reductions in CO2 emissions and improved resource conservation, highlighting its potential for enhancing sustainability. Mechanical properties such as compressive and tensile strengths decreased with higher NGP percentages, suggesting a trade-off between cost and structural performance. Physically, the concrete mixtures with higher NGP content exhibited increased porosity and water absorption, affecting the durability. The results demonstrate that while NGP incorporation offers economic and environmental benefits, it also necessitates careful consideration of its impacts on precast concrete's mechanical and physical properties. This comprehensive analysis underscores the need for a balanced approach to optimize NGP usage in concrete for sustainable and functional construction applications.

Not all compost produced meets established quality standards, which can lead to environmental challenges. This study explores the compost, as a feedstock for biochar production. Mature compost was utilized as a substrate, and the pyrolysis process involved heating samples within a temperature range of 400-650 °C, at 50 °C intervals, with heating rates of 10 °C·min⁻¹, 15 °C·min⁻¹, or 20 °C·min⁻¹ for a duration of 60 minutes. The resultant biochars were exposed to a gas mixture analogous to composting gas (CO2, CO, H2S, NH3, CH4 in N2).Our findings reveal a significant correlation between pyrolysis temperature and the sorption characteristics of compost-derived biochars. Specifically, biochars produced at temperatures of 550 °C, 600 °C, and 650 °C (with a heating rate of 10 °C·min⁻¹) demonstrated the highest efficacy in reducing emissions of CO2, CH4, and H2S, achieving reductions of 69%, 69%, and 72%, respectively. In contrast, the performance of these biochars for CO and NH3 adsorption was comparatively lower. Notably, biochars produced at 400 °C and 450 °C exhibited enhanced adsorption properties for CO emissions.This study underscores the substantial potential of compost-derived biochar for gas adsorption applications. However, due to its marked capacity for CH4 sorption, it is more likely to serve in mitigating emissions during composting rather than for biogas purification.

Photosynthetic inefficiencies limit the productivity and sustainability of crop production and the resilience of agriculture to future societal and environmental challenges. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) has inherently low catalytic efficiency, making it a key target for photosynthesis and crop improvement. However, introducing mutations to the chloroplast-encoded Rubisco large subunit (rbcL), which contains the enzyme's catalytic sites, is technically challenging. In this study, we successfully generated a range of chloroplast-genome-edited Arabidopsis thaliana plants targeting rbcL by a targeted base editor, ptpTALECD. The M309I and D397N substitutions in rbcL resulted in an increased Rubisco catalytic rate (kcat) without any reductions of Rubisco content, thereby enhancing photosynthetic rates and plant growth under both current atmospheric CO2 concentrations (i.e., 381 μmol mol−1) and projected future concentrations (i.e., 549 μmol mol−1). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis showed that the M309I and D397N substitutions, although located far from the catalytic site, induce structural alterations in the catalytic (60s) loops. Our findings highlight the potential of Rubisco engineering to improve plant photosynthesis and growth, and underscore the unique opportunities that chloroplast genome editing offers for enhancing photosynthesis and crop productivity and reducing atmospheric CO2 levels in a non-GMO context.

In this study, Cu–Co/In2O3 bimetallic catalysts were prepared by using a deposition precipitation method. The strong hydrogen dissociation ability of Cu decreased the reduction temperature of CoO to Co, thereby promoting the formation of the Cu–Co alloy. The interaction between Cu and Co led to electron transfer from Cu to Co, which effectively inhibited the formation of the harmful Cu–In alloy and facilitated the generation of oxygen vacancies in In2O3. The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies in Cu–Co/In2O3 increased CO2 adsorption and promoted the conversion of the methanol intermediate HCOO* to CH3O*. The Cu–Co/In2O3 catalyst exhibited 10.2% conversion and 72% methanol selectivity at 300 °C and 5 MPa, which was higher than those of the monometallic catalyst Cu/In2O3 and Co/In2O3.

This study evaluates three CO₂ point sources to establish criteria for recommending demonstration sites through a Techno-Economic Assessment (TEA). Using uniform design criteria, the analysis examined key process configurations, including flue gas treatment, CO₂ capture, solvent regeneration, compression, and liquefaction. The study was based on a capture capacity of 1 million tons of CO₂ annually (1 MTPA) at 90% efficiency, utilizing a commercially available CO₂ absorbent (30 wt% monoethanolamine, MEA). The resulting design packages provided key economic and operational metrics such as utility consumption, footprint, CAPEX, and OPEX for comparative analysis.Key findings reveal the significant influence of flue gas CO₂ concentration on process performance and costs, assuming the same CO2 capture capacity (1 MTPA). The results indicate that as the CO₂ concentration in flue gas decreases, the capture cost tends to increase. Consequently, coal-fired power plants were identified as the most suitable candidates for an initial large-scale demonstration project due to their high CO₂ concentration and relatively lower costs. An additional analysis evaluated the potential improvements of applying an advanced solvent, developed domestically for CO₂ capture in coal-fired power plants. The advanced solvent demonstrated a 44% reduction in regeneration energy, leading to a significant reduction in overall OPEX by up to 23%. These findings provide valuable insights for early-stage assessments of large-scale CCS demonstration projects, supporting South Korea's efforts to achieve its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).

The buildings sector's energy demand and CO2 emissions are rising despite various energy standards and carbon disclosure initiatives. Drawing from the author's experience as the former buildings sector lead at the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), this paper investigates the suitability of the initiative's methodology and workflow for decarbonizing the sector. The paper demonstrates the incompatibility of current emissions accounting principles with the buildings sector and how this allowed companies to 'artificially' achieve emissions-reduction targets without tangibly improving the environmental performance of buildings. Given the sector's limited share of renewable energy, the paper critiques the initiative's disregard of buildings energy demand and questions how 'science-based' its interpretation of Net-Zero is. The paper introduces an alternative proposal whereby energy efficiency targets for buildings are derived from that share and, to be 1.5°C-aligned, companies within the sector must demonstrate that buildings they own, finance, or design comply with these targets.

The world needs alternative energy sources due to the aggravating problem of global warming with the use of fossil fuels. Thermochemical routes utilizing thermal energy, appears to be a promising method for splitting H2O/CO2 into green fuels such as H2/CO with the help of a redox mediator/oxygen carrier (OC). This review focuses on one of the most promising OC, ceria, as a redox material due to its exceptional thermal stability at elevated temperatures and rapid reaction kinetics. The influence of various parameters, such as reduction (TR), oxidation temperature (TO), and the difference (ΔT= TR-TO) during the ceria-based thermochemical cycling process was analyzed utilizing data in open literature from 2006 onward. The discussion encompasses the impact of these parameters on fuel yield, oxygen yield, and fuel to oxygen yield ratio. Introduction of a novel reactor train system (RTS) combined with oxygen pumping is found to enhance thermal-to-fuel efficiency to an impressive 40%, marking a significant advancement in the field.

This study investigates the potential of Potassium Feldspar-phosphate-based geopolymer concrete as a sustainable alternative to conventional concrete, addressing the environmental concerns associated with CO2 emissions during cement production. While geopolymer concrete offers a promising path toward sustainability, its performance often falls short of Portland cement concrete. This study investigates utilizing nano-silica to enhance the performance of geopolymer concrete. Potassium feldspar powder, metakaolin, and rice husk ash were combined to create a ternary mixture that included different amounts of nano-silica. The resulting geopolymer composition's mechanical characteristics were assessed. The mechanical qualities were evaluated using split tensile and compressive strength tests. The findings revealed that a 4% nano-silica dosage (GC-N4) yielded the most significant improvement in strength and durability. The GC-N4 mix performed superior in all metrics, demonstrating the highest compressive (42.86 MPa) and split tensile (3.8 Mpa) strengths. Reduction in water absorption and durability aspects were also optimum in GC-N4. These results highlight the potential of incorporating nano-silica into a ternary mix of potassium feldspar powder, metakaolin, and rice husk ash to significantly enhance the overall performance of geopolymer concrete, promoting its wider adoption as a sustainable construction material.

This study explores the intricate relationship between tourism development, economic growth, energy consumption, and environmental sustainability in developing countries, with a particular focus on Indonesia and Brazil. While tourism significantly contributes to economic growth and job creation, its rapid expansion often exacerbates environmental pressures, raising concerns about long-term sustainability. By analyzing the case of Indonesia, where tourism is both a vital economic driver and a source of environmental stress, this study highlights the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection. Furthermore, the paper performs an empirical investigation of the impact of international visitor arrivals, economic growth, and energy consumption on CO2 emissions in Brazil. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique, the study aims to fill a gap in understanding the relationship between tourism and carbon emissions, particularly in the context of carbon neutrality and the Sustainable Development Goals. The findings aim to inform the development of policies that mitigate the environmental impact of tourism while fostering sustainable economic growth. This study contributes to the broader literature on the role of decarbonization in achieving emission reductions and promoting sustainable tourism practices.

Water and wastewater infrastructure is a major energy consumer and an important source of global greenhouse gas emissions: on average, 10.6 kg CO2/m3 of water is consumed. The European Environment Agency in 2019 estimated these emissions from wastewater treatment operations in Europe alone at over 25 MtCO2eq. Increased demand (in terms of volumes and quality) in the water sector raises expectations of future increases if appropriate measures will not be undertaken. Many water companies and utilities associations have been or are developing plans to achieve net zero on an industry-wide basis by 2050, and some have cut emissions by 50% in the last ten years. About half of energy-related emissions from water sector facilities could be significantly abated by applying existing technologies, and close to 95% of this objective could be achieved at zero or negative cost with proper innovation strategies. This paper examines and discusses issues, possibilities, and technologies that could be considered in planning the reduction of water and WW-related GHG emissions with a holistic view of the entire water sector, based on a recent literature review.

Reservoir simulation has been a primary tool in the oil and gas industry for decades, to model the fluid (oil-gas-water) transport in porous media to eventually predict hydrocarbon production. However, with the growing concerns over climate change and greenhouse gases emissions, flow simulation is being adapted with new features to account for CO2 storage and GHG reduction options. The new challenges associated with gas storage simulations - such as monitoring the gas migration and studying the risk of leakages - require the use of large models (i.e., regional aquifers) and large timescale simulations (1000 years). Moreover, new physical phenomena associated with gas injection, such as trapping mechanisms, gas solubility and mobility, should be accounted for. These new challenges require advanced numerical methods and high-performance computing to achieve reliable and efficient results. In this work, we present the new functionalities developed, such as the implementation of new equations of state, along with the applications of these new developments on operational studies for gas injection and storage. The main objectives of this work are to demonstrate the benefits of using a novel reservoir simulator for gas storage applications, and to illustrate the impact of the different parameters on the forecast of gas injection.

Batch-cell provides a quick way to test the performance of an electrochemical catalyst. A fundamental understanding of physics behind the batch-cell operation could shed light on parameters that either could be fine-tuned to get the desired performance, or by careful optimization, overall performance of the batch-cell could be improved. Therefore, a one-dimensional numerical model is developed to study the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction in a batch-cell with three different working electrode configurations: solid electrode, glassy carbon electrode, and gas diffusion layer electrode. Experimental results of two Cu-based catalysts are used to obtain the electrochemical kinetic parameters, and to validate the numerical model. Simulation results demonstrate that both gas diffusion layer electrode, and glassy carbon electrode with porous catalyst layer have a superior performance over solid electrode in terms of total current density. Furthermore, we studied the impact of key parameters of batch-cell with glassy carbon electrode such as boundary layer thickness, catalyst layer thickness, catalyst layer porosity, electrolyte nature, and strength of an electrolyte on total current density at a fixed applied cathodic potential of -1.0 V vs RHE.

GLJ will deliver a comprehensive update on the current status of policies and incentives supporting economically viable Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) deployment in Canada and in the United States (U.S.). Key components of the paper include a comparative analysis of the incentives in each jurisdiction; deterministic economical modelling of theoretical CCS projects based on public data sources; scenario analysis of the CCS economic models based on different assumptions of incentives eligibility; and the application of stochastic modelling techniques to assess the impact of project cost uncertainties under the varying scenarios of incentive eligibility. The analysis will begin with a description of relevant CCS policies and incentives in both the U.S. and Canada as to contextualize the functionality and potential economic impact that each policy has on eligible CCS projects. Canadian policies and incentives that will be described and subsequently considered for inputs into project economic modelling scenarios include:1) Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Carbon Pricing2) Federal CCUS Investment Tax Credit (CCUS-ITC)3) Alberta Carbon Capture Incentive Program (ACCIP)4) Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD)U.S. policies and incentives that will be described and subsequently considered for inputs into project economic modelling scenarios include:1) Inflation Reduction Act Section 45Q Carbon Capture Tax Credits (45Q Credits)2) California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits (LCFS Credits)3) Voluntary carbon market credits (i.e., American Carbon Registry Credits)Following the description of relevant policies and incentives for both Canada and the U.S., a deterministic economic cash flow model will be presented. The economic model will be based on a hypothetical CCS project that will inject at a flat rate of 1.0 million tons per annum (MTPA) into a subsurface saline aquifer at approximately 2,000 meters depth over an assumed operational project life of 25 years. Real-world cost estimates, including capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX), will be derived from existing CCS projects that publish publicly available cost and operations data. The physical scope of the model will encompass costs and operations related to the development and operation of only the CO2 Transportation and Storage (T&S) infrastructure, as to run the economics from the perspective of an open access CO2 T&S Hub Operator (i.e., "CCS Hub" or "CCS-as-a-service" business model). GLJ includes an important step in its modelling and evaluation process by applying ranges of uncertainty to median project cost estimates through stochastic modelling techniques. Stochastic modelling integrates probabilistic distributions for key input variables, such as capital expenditures, fixed/variable operational costs, service tolls and fees, and the varying levels of funding eligibility where appropriate. This methodology generates a spectrum of potential economic outcomes across a range of logically distributed input parameters, providing a comprehensive understanding of economic possibilities associated with the CCS project scope as described above (CO2 T&S hub, 1 MTPA injection rate, 25-year life, etc.). The findings of the analysis will shed light on the intricate economic dynamics of CCS projects under varying policy and incentive scenarios. The results will be presented through the comparison of project specific economic outputs such as Net Present Value (NPV), Profit-to-Investment Ratio (PIR), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and breakeven cost per tonne sequestered ($/tCO2) for both the American and Canadian CCS project scenarios. This will provide a strong visual to show the comparative economics of CCS investment between the two jurisdictions. Understanding these complex dynamics is crucial for policymakers, investors, and industry stakeholders as they navigate the path towards sustainable and economically viable CCS solutions.

Electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and solvation effects can alter the free energies of ionizable functional groups in proteins and other nanoporous architectures, allowing such structures to tune acid–base chemistry to support specific functions. Herein, we expand on this theme to examine how metal sites (M = H2, ZnII, CoII, CoI) affect the pKa of benzoic acid guests bound in discrete porphyrin nanoprisms (M3TriCage) in CD3CN. These host–guest systems were chosen to model how porous metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts might influence H+ transfer processes that are needed to support important electrochemical reactions (e.g., reductions of H+, O2, or CO2). Usefully, the cavities of the host–guest complexes become hydrated at low water concentrations (10–40 mM), providing a good representation of the active sites of porous electrocatalysts in water. Under these conditions, Lewis acidic CoII and ZnII ions increase the Bro̷nsted acidities of the guests by 4 and 8 pKa units, respectively, while reduction of the CoII sites to anionic CoI sites produces an electrostatic potential that lowers acidity by ca. 4 units (8 units relative to the CoII state). Lacking functional metal sites, H6TriCage increases the acidity of the guests by just 2.5 pKa units despite the 12+ charge of this host and contributions from other factors (hydrogen bonding, hydration) that might stabilize the deprotonated guests. Thus, the metal sites have dominant effects on acid–base chemistry in the M3TriCages, providing a larger pKa range (12.75 to ≥24.5) for an encapsulated acid than attained via other confinement effects in proteins and artificial porous materials.

During CO2/HCO3– reduction with renewable biomass, achieving high-efficiency production of the target products is vital but challenging. In this study, an NH2– functional-group-modified MIL-53(Fe) catalyst was synthesized using a facile and efficient method. Under the action of the NH2-MIL-53(Fe) catalyst, a clear synergistic effect was exhibited on the transformation of glucose and NaHCO3 into formic acid with a high yield of 50% at a low reaction temperature (190 °C) via a three-pronged route, which mainly involved the decomposition of intermediates of glucose to gradually reduce NaHCO3 to formic acid under hydrothermal conditions. An in-depth analysis of the catalytic mechanism and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the increased alkalinity of active sites by the NH2– functional group incorporation into the catalytic system enhanced the crucial reaction steps and reduced the activation energy of the crucial reactions, including glucose isomerization, aldehyde intermediate retro-aldol condensation, and redox of aldehyde compounds and NaHCO3 to formic acid, thereby promoting the generation of target products and suppressing side products. This study addresses the challenge of reducing NaHCO3 from renewable biomass to commercial formic acid by constructing multifunctional active sites, thus providing a new strategy for achieving carbon cycling.

The article analyzes current problems of improving the rules of law of the EAEU aimed at greening the transport systems of the member states. The research was carried out using general and special methods of scientific knowledge, including formal-logical, comparative law, etc. The features of the development of world transport systems in connection with the global energy transition are analyzed, and the lack of alternative to the transition to green technologies in transport, in particular, the electrification of transport systems, is emphasized. The expediency of taking collective measures at the level of an integration association is substantiated, allowing to minimize costs and increase the efficiency of greening the transport systems of the member states. Contains proposals for improving the legal norms of the EAEU, such as the First Package of Measures (Road Map) for cooperation between the EAEU member states within the framework of the climate agenda and Appendix No. 24 to the Treaty (Protocol on Coordinated (Agreed) Transport Policy. The feasibility of forming a specialized structure in the EEC is substantiated, the functions of which would include calculating optimal target indicators for the transition to environmentally friendly transport technologies. In general, according to the author, the development of the most promising directions of transport policy in the EAEU, taking into account the energy transition and reduction of CO2 emissions, should be carried out not only by the EAEU bodies and representatives of relevant ministries (transport, environmental protection, energy, etc.), but also with the involvement of a wide range of specialists and experts, as well as members of the business community represented by transport companies, environmental non-governmental organizations and representatives of the public. The results of the study can be applied in the legislative and law enforcement practice of the EAEU, the Republic of Belarus and other member states of the EAEU.    

    

## Two-stage stochastic optimization of sustainable bioethanol supply chain based on demand uncertainty and seasonal availability of biomass

Bioethanol-blended gasoline fuel is one of the alternatives for reducing CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. Since its production is still dependent on demand fluctuations and feedstock availability, an optimal supply chain design needs to be evaluated. A two-stage stochastic optimization model with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) was developed for designing the optimal bioethanol supply chain under the constraints of multi-feedstock second-generation biomass based on seasonal availability and demand uncertainty. Two optimization models were implemented. The goal of the first model was to maximize the expected profits of the supply chain based on the optimal combination of biomass type, plant location and biomass-bioethanol pathways. The second extension model focused on maximizing expected profits of the supply chain with the least amount of impact on the environment via the reduction of net emission to result in an optimal supply chain. The validation process was then performed by comparing the stochastic and deterministic models in terms of plant location and operating decisions. The first model was applied to actual data of a Thailand case study involving 26 existing plants and agricultural residue availability. The optimization result illustrates that the stochastic model is 16% more profitable than the deterministic model for all random data sets. Furthermore, the extension model shows that carbon credit can contribute to around 5% of the total profit earned. Thus, the proposed models can address demand uncertainty in supply chain design and can be implemented by policymakers to achieve sustainable bioethanol production.

Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is a universal issue of significant concern in the petroleum industry, with the potential for enormous economic losses and casualties. This study focused on the effect of temperature on MIC and the corrosion mechanism. The corrosion rate, morphology, corrosion products, and microbial community composition of produced fluid samples from the Zhanjiang oilfield were measured after anaerobic culture at 30 and 60 °C for 14 days. The corrosion rate of the Z1 and Z2 samples decreased with increasing temperature, while the corrosion rate of the Z3 sample changed from light corrosion to heavy corrosion. The Z1 sample was dominated by pitting corrosion, the Z2 sample had a relatively smooth surface, and the Z3 sample was observed to have one dimensional wormhole corrosion at 60 °C. The microbial community composition by 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) sequence showed that the bacterial communities were dominated by Pseudomonas and Bacillus, and the archaeal communities were mainly composed of Methanothermobacter, Methanosaeta, and Candidatus Nitrosotenuis, which was prevalent in Z3 samples at 60 °C. It suggested that MIC could be caused by extracellular electron transfer and reduction of nitrate or nitrite to N2 and NH4+ by bacteria, and utilization of CO2 to produce CH4 by archaea. Overall, the results of this study can provide comprehensive data and new insights into corrosion management strategies for oil fields.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have exhibited enormous potential toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). The accessibility of active sites has a significant influence on their catalytic performance, especially in the mass-transport-limited catalytic reaction like CO2RR. Therefore, the rational design of SACs with easily accessible and high-loading atomic sites is crucial but still remains a grand challenge. In this work, a thermally removable template strategy combined with emulsion-induced interface anisotropic assembly method was developed to prepare iron single-atom catalyst with easy accessibility and high loading amount. For CO2RR, as-synthesized Fe-SACs supported on hollow porous carbon nanocube (H–Fe–NC SACs) display high selectivity toward CO. Most importantly, the CO partial current density of H–Fe–NC SACs at −0.98 V can reach −23.5 mA cm–2, which is 2.3 times higher than that of Fe-SACs on solid carbon sphere. The hollow and porous carbon matrix efficiently enhances the accessibility of the active sites and promotes mass transport, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics of the catalysis reaction. It is expected that this carrier engineering can provide a versatile route to improve the catalyst performance of the mass-transport-limited electrocatalytic reaction.

Salinity is one of the important abiotic stresses affecting growth, photosynthesis, ion accumulation, and antioxidant defense systems in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). This study investigated the physio-biochemical and antioxidative responses in different salt-sensitive sunflower genotypes: GP-4030 and BARI Surzumukhi 2 as newly identified tolerant genotypes, PS-2 as sensitive and Hysan 33 as standard tolerant. Salt stresses caused higher reduction in relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll (Chl) content, K+ and K+/Na+ ratio, photosynthetic rate (pN), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), and intercellular CO2 concentration rate (Ci) in salt-sensitive genotype. This genotype had higher Na+, superoxide (O2.-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid peroxidation (MDA) and proline (Pro) content than the tolerant genotypes. The tolerant genotypes maintained higher Pro content than the salt-sensitive genotypes under salt stress. All the tolerant genotypes had higher increment of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities under salinity (12 dS m-1) than the salt-sensitive genotype. Similarly, increment of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity was higher in the tolerant genotypes, but glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was higher in salt-sensitive genotype. However, both monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) activities decreased with salinity level. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity increased in all the genotypes under salinity and was higher in the tolerant genotypes. Higher accumulation of Pro, along with improved physiological and biochemical parameters in the tolerant genotypes, can confer tolerance by reducing oxidative damage through up-regulating antioxidant defense under salinity.

The article presents results of tests concerning the use of waste biomass-derived char as a partial substitute for solid fuel used in the iron ore sintering process (primarily coke breeze). The tests were performed in a system used for the physical simulation of the sintering process, making it possible for flue gases to be recycled back to the process. During the tests, particular attention was paid to the analysis of properties of flue gases with the simultaneous recirculation of these gases back to the process. The optimal fraction of char from biomass (i.e. not worsening either sintering process or sinter parameters) in the total fuel was determined on the basis of previous experience. It was found that the use of carbonised biomass improved the reducing properties of the sinter and had a positive effect on its strength. At the same time it was observed that the amounts of CO2 and NOx as well as of CO and CH4 emitted when using char were higher than those accompanying the use of coke breeze (only) as fuel. In order to reduce the impact of the char addition on flue gas parameters, sintering process-related tests also included the recycling of flue gas back to the sintering process. Flue gas properties were identified (both before dedusting and in the stack) using stationary flue gas analysers. The tests also included measurements of volatile organic compounds. The measurement results were used to determine the influence of the use of waste biomass-derived char on flue gas properties and primary parameters of the sintering process. The overall test results revealed failure to obtain expected reduction in the emission of undesirable compounds in off-gases (in relation to the use of the constant 15 % fraction of waste biomass-derived char and the gradual 45 % increase in the amount of off-gases recycled back to the process).

This study explores the impact of sodium silicate on wood ash blended cement concrete, which contributes significantly to CO2 emissions. This research holds great potential for the construction industry by aiding in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, conserving natural resources, and promoting waste minimization. The specific research objectives are Characterizing sand, granite, and wood ash, Producing concrete mixes with wood ash and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) replacements of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%, and determine their compressive strength, workability, density, and water absorption, and Developing a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to determine optimal proportions of cement, w/c ratio, wood ash, and sodium silicate to achieve target compressive strength, workability, water absorption, and density in concrete mixes. Concrete specimens were tested for compressive strength, workability, density, and water absorption. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model is significant because it is designed to capture historical information of time series data and is suitable for predicting long-term nonlinear series. The LSTM predicted compressive strength based on inputs of cement, water/cement ratio, sodium silicate, and wood ash. Results indicated that sodium silicate significantly enhanced early compressive strength and workability, making this blend a viable option for sustainable construction where early strength is essential.

Abstract Deeply fractured rocks of meteorite impact craters are suggested as prime niches for subsurface microbial colonization. Methane can be a product of such microbial communities and seeps of methane from impact craters on Earth are of strong interest as they act as analogs for Mars. Previous studies report signs of ancient microbial methanogenesis in the Devonian Siljan meteorite impact structure in Sweden, but the proportion of microbial methane, metabolic pathways, and potential modern activity remain elusive. In this study, gas composition, hydrochemistry, oil organic geochemistry, and microbial community analyses are reported in 400 m deep fractures of the Siljan impact structure. The results showed a dominantly microbial origin for methane, which was supported by highly negative δ 13 C CH4 and positive δ 13 C CO2 values along with multiply substituted isotopologues (Δ 13 CH 3 D) that indicated disequilibrium fractionation due to microbial kinetic isotope effects. The presence of C 2 to C 5 hydrocarbons suggested a minor thermogenic input in the gas mix. Characterization of the microbial community via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and real-time PCR indicated a low abundance of several methanogenic archaeal populations, which is common for settings with active methanogenesis. Evidence of oil biodegradation suggested that secondary microbial hydrocarbon utilization was involved in the methanogenesis. Low sulfate and high alkalinity in the groundwaters also suggested a dominantly microbial methane formation driven by infiltration of freshwater that was coupled to sulfate reduction and secondary utilization of early mature thermogenic hydrocarbons.

Adapting to climate change and controlling carbon emissions have emerged as significant challenges faced by the international community. The high-quality pedestrian space system of TOD blocks, as an important means for carbon reduction and carbon sink increase in cities, showcases the effect of green intensification and low-carbon sustainable urban space development. In this study, by combining the research on low-carbon block creation and urban microclimate, focusing on the technical process of the three stages of pre-treatment, core calculation, and post-treatment, comprehensively considering the three elements of microclimate, namely wind, heat, and carbon, and their influencing parameters, and introducing a CFD simulation method for porous media, a CFD simulation technology framework for microclimate improvement in urban design is constructed. Through the spatial visualization of the software solution calculation results and the correlation and comparative analysis of the measured data, we quantitatively analyze the coupling relationship between the block morphology and the comprehensive environment of wind, heat, and carbon. The research results indicate that by rationally adjusting indicator elements such as the height-to-width ratio of streets and entrance forms, it is possible to effectively facilitate cooling, ventilation, and air circulation within blocks and dilute the CO2 concentration. Finally, from the urban design element systems at the micro, meso, and macro levels, the adaptive planning strategies in the three dimensions of the spatial form, constituent elements, and planning guidelines of TOD blocks are summarized and refined, with the aim of achieving the low-carbon transformation of cities through the creation of a healthy microclimate environment.

Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) represent an innovative approach to thinking and designing cities sustainably, in compliance with the European Union energy strategy. This strategy integrates sectors such as urban planning, energy, and construction to synergistically address energy and environmental challenges. Studies on sustainability assessment systems applied in PEDs evidenced that they focus mostly on energy aspects, while few include a comprehensive life cycle assessment of equivalent CO2 emissions, considering the building component and the impacts of the materials used. Additionally, most assessments are conducted on the urban and district scale, such as Neighborhood Sustainability Assessments (NSA), which begin to correlate PEDs with the dynamics of selecting sustainable materials for green-certified projects, analyzed throughout the entire life cycle, relying on the adoption of Green Building Rating Systems (GBRS) at the building scale. To explore the impact of environmentally friendly (i.e., ‘green’) GBRS certifications in the selection of building materials and products according to sustainability criteria, and to encourage their use in projects explicitly referring to PEDs, this study analyzes the technical solutions implemented in two significant residential building renovation projects in Italy from a PED perspective. It proposes a classification system based on the required targets of energy efficiency, energy production, and energy flexibility. The results include the definition of an expandable portfolio of technical solutions, an analytical comparison between the materials used in the energy renovation projects of the case studies examined, and the sustainability criteria provided by voluntary ’green’ certification tools (GBRS). The collected evidence offers an operational framework that confirms the positive impact of GBRS certifications and the related selection of materials on sustainable urban development, contributing to the scientific debate on PEDs. Furthermore, the use of voluntary ’green’ certifications at the building scale can be encouraged in the context of the transition towards PEDs, aiming to identify specific criteria and indicators for the selection of building materials to be integrated into future PED certifications. This aims to contribute to creating energy self-sufficient urban areas, focusing on sustainability, efficiency, and innovation, in line with global emission reduction and climate change mitigation goals.    

    

## Cравнительный анализ количественного изменения фенольных соединений плодов хурмы (diospyros kaki l.) при разных вариантах хранения

Исследования, посвященные изучению химического состава, особенно фенольных соединений, использованию хурмы как сырья для производства различных пищевых продуктов, а также методы хранения мало изучены. Одной из причин ограниченного потребления плодов хурмы связано с ее сезонностью и неусовершенствованными методами хранения. Плоды хурмы с высокой пищевой ценностью в свежем виде употребляют только в течение 1–2 мес. Бόльшая часть их остается на верхушке дерева, портится и выбрасывается как отход. С точки зрения здорового образа жизни, население должно использовать этот ценный пищевой продукт не сезонно, а в течение всего года. Поэтому использование в каждодневном рационе свежих плодов хурмы, а также определение оптимального режима хранения является актуальной проблемой. Для повышения устойчивости организма к различным заболеваниям важно в рацион питания добавлять плоды хурмы, обладающие антиоксидантными, антивирусными, антимутагенными и противомикробными свойствами. Поскольку плоды хурмы богаты фенольными соединениями, которые играют важную роль в регуляции процесса кровообращения, выведении радиации из организма, в прекращении деятельности микроорганизмов, вызывающих некоторые инфекционные заболевания. Объектом исследования являются процессы сохранности фенольных соединений и уменьшение их потерь при хранении. Предмет исследования – широко распространенные на территории Азербайджанской Республики сорта хурмы Хачиа и Хиакуме. Сорта хурмы Хачиа и Хиакуме хранились в холодильной камере в 5 вариантах. Фенольные соединения были определены методом эффективной высокожидкостной хроматографии. В результате исследований в сорте Хачиа было обнаружено 15, а в сорте Хиакуме 14 представителей фенольных соединений. Сохранность качественных показателей плодов хурмы, в том числе фенольных соединений, обладающих антиоксидантными и антимикробными свойствами, зафиксирована при хранении хурмы в холодильной камере при температуре –2...–3 °С в условиях РГС, с содержанием газов 3–4 % CO2, 2–3 % O2. Research devoted to the study of the chemical composition, especially phenolic compounds, the use of persimmon as a raw material for the production of various food products, as well as storage methods have been poorly studied. One of the reasons for the limited consumption of persimmon fruits is due to its seasonality and unimproved storage methods [6]. Fresh persimmon fruits with high nutritional value are consumed only for 1–2 months. Most of it remains at the top of the tree, deteriorates and is thrown away as waste. From the point of view of a healthy lifestyle, the population should use this valuable food product, not seasonally, but throughout the year. Therefore, the use of fresh persimmon fruits in the daily diet, as well as determining the optimal storage mode, is an urgent problem. The object of the study is the preservation processes of phenolic compounds and the reduction of their losses during storage. To increase the body's resistance to various diseases, it is important to add persimmon fruits, which have antioxidant, antiviral, antimutagenic and antimicrobial properties, to the diet. Because persimmon fruits are rich in phenolic compounds, which play an important role in regulating the blood circulation process, removing radiation from the body, and stopping the activity of microorganisms that cause some infectious diseases. The subject of the study is the persimmon varieties Khachia and Khiakume, widespread in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Persimmon varieties Khachia and Hiakume were stored in the refrigerator in 5 variants. Phenolic compounds were determined by performance high-liquid chromatography. As a result of research, 15 representatives of phenolic compounds were discovered in the Khachia variety, and 14 in the Hiakume variety. The preservation of the quality indicators of persimmon fruits, including phenolic compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, was recorded when persimmons were stored in a refrigerator at a chamber temperature of –2...–3 °C under RGS conditions, with a gas content of 3–4 % CO2, 2–3 % O2.

In the context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, straw returning plays a significant role in improving soybean yield and achieving sustainable agricultural development. However, the combined effects of straw returning and biogas slurry on farmland greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon and nitrogen characteristics, and soybean yield remain unclear. Therefore, this study conducted field experiments in the black soil region of Northeast China for 5 consecutive years from 2020 to 2024, and studied the full amount of soybean straw returning (deep ploughing, surface covering) and biogas slurry ratio (R0: 100% CF; R1:25% Bs+75% CF; R2:50% Bs+50% CF; R3:75% Bs+25% CF; R4:100% Bs; Bs is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the biogas slurry, kg/ha; CF is the recommended nitrogen application rate, 80 kg/ha) on soil nitrogen and carbon indicators, greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, yield, greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) and global warming potential (GWP). The results showed that soybean yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) increased initially with the biogas slurry ratio, then declined at higher dosages. Compared to the nitrogen fertilizer treatment (R0), soybean yield significantly increased by 2.16–13.31%. Additionally, SOC, MBC, DOC, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and MBN were enhanced by 10.52–25.72%, 3.52–10.52%, 1.36–5.58%, 10.41–24.10%, 9.27–24.16%, and 2.46–5.69%, respectively. Under the same biogas slurry application, deep ploughing significantly reduced CO2 (4.29–16.27%), N2O (3.28–11.01%), and CH4 (4.21–18.63%) emissions, as well as GWP (8.96–17.63%) and GHGI (9.26–16.29%) compared to surface covering. The yield of 75% biogas slurry ratio (R3) increased significantly by 4.24–18.36%, and the yield increased by 2.16–18.36% with the experimental year, alongside increases in SOC (10.52–25.72%), MBC (3.52–10.52%), DOC (1.36–5.58%), NO3--N (11.47–25.27%), NH4+-N (10.04–22.74%), and MBN (2.12–5.74%). Mantel test results indicated that deep turning combined with biogas slurry application promoted yield and reduced GHGs emissions by increasing SOC, DOC, and NO3--N in the soil. Therefore, replacing nitrogen fertilizer with 75% biogas slurry is an effective strategy for achieving higher yield, carbon sequestration, and emission reduction in soybean production, contributing to the sustainable development of agriculture.

Recent U.S. federal investments (e.g., 2021 Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Law), enhancements to the IRS section 45Q tax credit (via the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act), and state legislative activities along with a continuum of research efforts have provided a backstop to de-risk carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects for developers. As a result, historic interest and investments in CCUS have been observed and a series of highly ambitious projects have been announced throughout the U.S. Even with these tailwinds, public opposition to these projects is on the rise, with notable examples in the Midwest and Louisiana. Further complicating this matter is the general lack of available data surrounding public sentiment as it relates to CCUS. Public comments submitted in response to Louisiana's Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI state primacy application, an act that awards the state regulatory oversight over CO2 injection wells, provide an opportunity to capture timely information from the public as it relates to CCUS in an effort to understand sentiment and critical messaging priorities. Importantly, this dataset may inform future engagement efforts and similar methodologies may support the development of project-specific strategies. An application programming interface (API) with www.regulations.gov was established to retrieve public comments from the Louisiana UIC Program; Class VI Primacy docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2023-0073). Individual letters with corresponding metadata (name, organization, location where provided) were saved and individual statements from each letter were extracted. Deduplication ensured that matching statements were included in the dataset only once. Unique themes and subthemes were identified, and text analytics was utilized to identify specific recommendations. A large language model was used to summarize key public comment patterns, and sentiment analysis was used to identify high-priority topics. Over 41,000 comments were received in response to Louisiana's UIC Class VI state primacy application. Of these, 727 were identified as unique, substantive, comments while the remainder represented mass mailer campaigns or duplicate text. Even still, this represents a significant increase in public interest when compared to the North Dakota and Wyoming UIC Class VI primacy applications which received a total of 15 and 7 unique comments, respectively.Of the 727 unique comments 400 included attachments and 327 did not. Comments that included no content or letters that were not machine readable were removed from the dataset, bringing the number of analyzed comments down to 683. In total, 537 comments were submitted by private citizens, 122 were submitted by companies or organizations, 17 were submitted by state government officials, with the remainder categorized as mass mail campaigns, local government officials, members of congress, or other. The 683 analyzed comments included over 12,000 separate statements that were examined for general sentiment. Here, positive sentiments are those with a sentiment score > 0.53, negative sentiments are those with a sentiment score < 0.46, and neutral statements are those with a sentiment score between the two. Individual statements were used in aggregate to determine the sentiment of each submitted comment. In total, 28% of the comments were positive, 56% were negative, and 16% were neutral. For the mass mailer campaigns, 25.5% were positive, while 74.5% were negative. Key words for positive and negative comments were captured to provide insight into the topics associated with each comment type. Similarly, key themes summarizing the positive and negative comments were extracted to evaluate specific topics that represent the broader dataset. In general, positive themes relate to existing competencies in subsurface activities and economic benefits, regulatory oversight by state agencies, and the incorporation of environmental justice into regulatory requirements. Negative themes generally relate to the safety and efficacy of CO2 storage, the oversight capabilities of the cognizant state agency and clarifications around existing regulations, and the need for appropriate consideration of environmental justice. Positive themes represent topics that may inspire confidence from stakeholders, while negative themes represent the types of questions or concerns that can be anticipated. The need for the widespread adoption of CCUS technologies as part of the energy transition is well documented. Simultaneously, the social environment within which new infrastructure projects are expected to operate is becoming increasingly challenging. While legacy wrongs or project-specific missteps are in part responsible for public perception challenges, a lack of real data to understand public sentiment and inform engagement strategies has further complicated matters. Here, text analytics and natural language processing is introduced as an important tool for the CCUS community, particularly as it relates to proactively identifying public concerns and developing messaging priorities. Importantly, a similar methodology can be applied to other datasets such as news media, meeting minutes, or survey data. In the project development context, this methodology may increase transparency and provide an opportunity to prioritize engagement and community-based strategies. Similarly, community sentiment can be tracked against project schedule and milestones, allowing for an objective assessment of community engagement and investment strategies.

EDITORIAL In 2024, Science, Engineering and Health Studies (SEHS) collaborated with the Thai Institute of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry International Conference (TIChE) to provide a platform for researchers to publish their work in the field of chemical engineering. The conference focused on the theme “Smart Solutions to Environmental Sustainability for a Better World,” emphasizing the development and implementation of intelligent and innovative technologies to address environmental challenges. The theme highlighted the integration of advanced scientific research and technical solutions into practical applications to tackle pressing issues such as environmental pollution, resource depletion, and climate change. The focus was on promoting sustainability across various sectors to improve global environmental health and ensure a sustainable future. As a result of this collaboration, seven selected research papers were published in 2024, showcasing groundbreaking contributions to environmental sustainability and innovative problem-solving in chemical engineering. Akkawong et al. (2024) proposed a novel framework that combines deep learning with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to improve prediction models based on small datasets, addressing issues such as overfitting and underfitting due to limited experimental data. By applying this integrated framework to predict the size of silver nanoparticles, the study demonstrates improved prediction performance with R2 values of 0.924 and 0.918 for the validation and test datasets, respectively. The LHS technique was employed to augment the dataset, enabling the development of a more accurate and robust prediction model. Models trained on the expanded dataset exhibited significantly higher accuracy in predicting silver nanoparticle sizes compared to those trained on limited data. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in delivering precise predictions even with small experimental datasets. To improve energy efficiency in chemical processes, particularly in distillation columns, Puangto et al. (2024) explored the design of an internally heat-integrated distillation column (HIDiC) using an economic-based column energy profile approach. The study introduced the concept of maximum energy saving per additional investment (MESAI) profiles, demonstrating the economic and energy-saving advantages of HIDiC designs over conventional methods. Using Aspen Plus simulations and economic evaluations, the research highlighted the effectiveness of MESAI profiles in optimizing heat loads and balancing additional investments, resulting in more cost-effective HIDiC configurations. The findings showed that HIDiC designs incorporating multiple side exchangers achieved lower operational costs and significantly enhanced energy efficiency. This work provides valuable insights into HIDiC design methodologies, emphasizing the economic feasibility and sustainability advantages of advanced distillation technologies. Another application model focused on developing a two-stage stochastic optimization model for a sustainable bioethanol supply chain under demand uncertainty and multi-season biomass. Fahrullazi and Siemanond (2024) considered multiple feedstocks such as rice residue, sugarcane residue, cassava residue, and palm residue, as well as varying biomass supply over the seasons. The model aimed to maximize profits by optimizing biomass type, plant location, and pathways. An extension model included environmental performance, specifically carbon credits, to enhance profit margins. The stochastic model outperformed the deterministic model by 16% in terms of profitability across various demand scenarios. In addition, the incorporation of carbon credits contributed around 5% to the total profit, showcasing the potential for sustainable bioethanol production with reduced CO2 emissions. The reduction of emitted CO2 was also addressed by New et al. (2024). They compared the life cycle impacts of conventional hydrogen production methods (methane steam reforming) with two zero-carbon emission technologies: proton exchange membrane electrolysis and methane pyrolysis. The analysis focused on five impact categories, with methane pyrolysis proving to have the lowest overall environmental impact. Despite relying on hydrocarbon feedstock, methane pyrolysis demonstrated significantly lower global warming potential and reduced toxicity impacts compared to steam methane reforming and proton exchange membrane electrolysis. The study highlighted the potential of methane pyrolysis as a sustainable hydrogen production method, emphasizing its role in promoting a circular carbon economy and reducing the scarcity of fossil resources. Two research were focused on the bio-circular-green economic model (BCG). Padettaku et al. (2024) investigated the effect of glycerol concentration on enhancing the fracture resistance of dried lotus leaves when used as a bio-coating agent. By incorporating glycerol, beeswax, and chitosan into the coating, the study aimed to improve the elastic properties of lotus leaves. The optimal ratio of glycerol in the bio-coating was determined based on the recovery percentage of lotus leaves post-coating, indicating improved elasticity. Results showed a 27% increase in recovery when using specific concentrations of chitosan, glycerol, and acetic solution. The coated lotus leaves exhibited increased moisture content and thickness, decreased contact angle, improved mechanical properties with reduced Young's modulus but increased elongation, and enhanced thermal stability compared to untreated leaves. Incorporating chitosan in the coating formulation reinforced the structure and improved water resistance. Sangjun et al. (2024) proposed the recovery of light cycle oil (LCO) discarded from the petroleum process. They focused on the hydrogenation reaction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in LCO using NiMo-based catalysts to produce higher value-added chemicals. Different catalyst supports such as γ-alumina, KIT-6, and β-zeolite were studied. The NiMo/KIT-6 catalyst had the highest efficiency in PAHs removal (77.4%) and selectivity towards alkylbenzenes, decalins, and tetralins. The acidity of the catalyst was found to be crucial for performance, with NiMo-zeolite exhibiting the highest total acidity. The study provided an alternative method for converting petroleum refinery by-products into valuable chemicals, contributing to sustainable development, and addressing environmental concerns related to PAHs in LCO. Singhyakaew and Rueangjitt (2024) investigated the effects of alkali treatment time and the SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratio on the structural modification of commercial and synthesized ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. The study focused on introducing mesopores into the ZSM-5 structure to enhance catalytic performance in cracking and reforming processes. The results showed that increasing alkali treatment time promoted the formation of mesopores in both commercial and synthesized ZSM-5 catalysts, leading to an increase in mesopore surface area and pore volume. However, excessive treatment time reduced mesoporosity in synthesized ZSM-5 samples, particularly at higher SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratios. The optimal conditions were achieved with synthesized ZSM-5 treated in a 0.2 M NaOH aqueous solution for 1 h at a SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratio of 140, resulting in a high mesopore surface area and volume while maintaining the integrity of the MFI structure.

As the demand for innovative and effective skin treatments grows, the field of dermatology continues to evolve, integrating cutting-edge technologies with new biological insights. Among the most impactful advances in recent years are medical laser therapies, widely used to treat skin. While the immediate effects of laser treatments are well-documented, research has begun to reveal that their benefits go deeper, potentially triggering long-lasting changes at the molecular level. At the heart of this molecular transformation is epigenetics, focusing on changes in gene expression that do not alter the underlying DNA sequence. Unlike permanent genetic mutations, epigenetic changes can be reversible and are heavily influenced by environmental and external factors, including therapeutic interventions like laser treatments. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation, control many of the key biological processes involved in skin health, aging, and repair [1, 2]. Recent research suggests that medical lasers induce epigenetic modifications that enhance skin regeneration and repair, offering longer lasting results than previously understood [3]. This commentary aims to explore how lasers trigger long-lasting regenerative effects through epigenetic mechanisms and how this knowledge could shape future advancements in dermatological care [4]. By understanding how lasers can tap into these epigenetic pathways, we open the door to more personalized and effective skin treatments that go beyond superficial improvements. The concept of epigenetics has revolutionized our understanding of how gene expression is modulated by external influences, including environmental exposure, stress, and injury. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic changes leave the DNA sequence intact but modify the way genes are expressed. These changes are reversible, offering a tantalizing avenue for therapeutic interventions in dermatology. In skin biology, epigenetic mechanisms play a critical role in processes like wound healing, inflammation, and aging [5]. Studies have shown that aging skin is associated with increased DNA methylation, which silences genes involved in collagen production and skin elasticity. Histone modifications, another key epigenetic mechanism, regulate the accessibility of chromatin, the structural framework of DNA, influencing gene transcription [3, 6]. In aging skin, histone acetylation and methylation patterns become dysregulated, contributing to reduced cellular repair and regeneration. Non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), have also emerged as important players in skin health. These small RNA molecules regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation into proteins. Specific miRNAs have been linked to the regulation of inflammation, collagen synthesis, and keratinocyte differentiation, all of which are critical for maintaining youthful, healthy skin [7, 8]. Laser treatments could modulate these epigenetic pathways by reprogramming molecular processes, resulting in more effective, longer lasting rejuvenation and improved overall skin health [9, 10]. The epigenetic changes triggered by laser treatments contribute to the long-term clinical improvements observed in skin rejuvenation, pigmentation correction, and scar reduction. For instance, fractional lasers, which create microthermal zones of injury surrounded by untreated skin, have been shown to improve the appearance of acne scars by promoting collagen production and tissue remodeling [11-13]. It is hypothesized that the regenerative effects of fractional lasers are partially due to epigenetic modifications, such as changes in histone acetylation that enhance the expression of collagen-related genes [14]. In treating pigmentation disorders like melasma, which is characterized by hyperpigmentation due to the overproduction of melanin, laser treatments targeting melanocytes can modulate epigenetic pathways [15]. By influencing DNA methylation and histone modifications, lasers reduce the expression of genes involved in melanogenesis, leading to a more balanced and long-lasting reduction in pigmentation. Laser-induced epigenetic changes also offer promising results in the treatment of aging skin. Considering that in aging skin, there is a considerable dysregulation of the expression of collagen-related genes and inflammation, ablative lasers stimulate a wound-healing response that resets this dysregulation [12, 14]. Epigenetic modifications induced by the laser treatment can restore a more youthful gene expression profile, increasing collagen production and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Medical lasers are widely used in dermatology for a range of indications, from scar treatment to wrinkle reduction and skin resurfacing. Lasers work by delivering controlled energy to specific layers of the skin, causing microthermal damage that stimulates the body's natural repair processes [16]. The most commonly used lasers in skin rejuvenation include ablative (e.g., CO2 and Er:YAG lasers) and non-ablative lasers, each varying in the depth and type of tissue injury they produce. What makes laser treatments particularly interesting from an epigenetic perspective is their ability to induce cellular stress [17]. This stress activates a cascade of repair processes in the skin, some of which are regulated by epigenetic modifications [18]. For example, the microdamage caused by laser treatment stimulates the inflammatory response, which in turn influences the expression of genes associated with wound healing, collagen production, and extracellular matrix remodeling. One of the primary epigenetic mechanisms influenced by lasers is DNA methylation, which involves the addition of a methyl group to the DNA molecule, typically at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands [3]. Laser-induced inflammation leads to changes in DNA methylation patterns, silencing genes involved in the skin's aging process and promoting the expression of genes that regulate tissue repair. Histone modifications, particularly acetylation and methylation, are also affected by laser treatments. These modifications determine how tightly DNA is wound around histones, which in turn regulates gene accessibility [8, 13]. Studies have shown that histone acetylation is associated with active gene transcription, including genes that promote collagen synthesis and cell proliferation [19]. By inducing controlled injury, lasers would activate histone acetyltransferases, enzymes that add acetyl groups to histones, thus facilitating the expression of genes involved in skin repair. Additionally, laser treatments can impact the expression of non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs. Research has demonstrated that certain miRNAs are upregulated following laser treatments, where they play a role in reducing inflammation and fibrosis while promoting epidermal regeneration [3]. The molecular changes induced by lasers, particularly in collagen synthesis, elastin production, and gene expression modulation, directly intersect with epigenetic processes. Lasers not only affect the physical structure of the skin but also influence gene activity by inducing epigenetic modifications that enhance cellular repair mechanisms and skin regeneration. For example, the activation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes leads to changes in the expression of key genes involved in collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix remodeling, closely tied to epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. The reduction in matrix metalloproteinases and heat shock proteins after laser treatment indicates a shift in the cellular stress response, potentially through epigenetic pathways that regulate protein expression during skin repair [20]. This highlights how lasers can "reprogram" the skin's cellular environment for long-term regenerative outcomes, offering new insights into how medical lasers can enhance skin health through both physical and epigenetic changes. Recent studies have further explored the multifaceted role of laser treatments, not only in skin rejuvenation but also in preventing carcinogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms. Fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) has demonstrated significant potential in preventing actinic neoplasia by re-establishing IGF-1 signaling in aged skin, thereby reducing UVB-induced DNA damage and suppressing the formation of new actinic keratoses and non-melanoma skin cancers [21]. Similarly, no ablative fractional lasers have shown promising prophylactic effects in patients with a history of keratinocyte carcinoma, where fibroblast activation and increased IGF-1 expression contribute to a reduced recurrence rate [21-23]. In a pivotal randomized controlled trial by Spandau et al. 48 individuals aged 60 years and older with considerable actinic damage were treated with FLR. The study revealed that a single FLR treatment was durable in restoring appropriate UVB response in geriatric skin for at least 2 years, providing long-term protection. Notably, FLR resulted in a sustained reduction in the number of actinic keratosis and a dramatic decrease in non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) on the treated arm (2 NMSCs) compared to the untreated arm (24 NMSCs) after 36 months [23]. This evidence suggests that laser therapies would act through epigenetic pathways, enhancing fibroblast function and keratinocyte repair while influencing collagen production and reducing matrix metalloproteinase activity [20]. The study by Pedersen et al. found that combining ablative fractional laser with the topical treatment vismodegib led to distinctive transcriptomic changes in early-stage basal cell carcinomas in murine models. This combination treatment showed promise in modulating gene expression patterns associated with tumor growth inhibition, indicating that laser-based interventions might enhance the efficacy of topical therapies in treating early carcinogenic lesion [24]. By modulating the skin's molecular environment, these treatments offer a protective and preventive role against carcinogenesis, highlighting the intersection of epigenetics, molecular biology, and advanced laser technologies in dermatological treatments. In addition to skin rejuvenation, medical lasers play a crucial role in managing pigmentary and vascular skin disorders through epigenetic regulation, complementing their established role in enhancing skin structure and resilience. Lasers targeting pigmentary conditions like melasma influence melanin synthesis by altering gene expression through DNA methylation and histone modifications. By suppressing genes responsible for melanin overproduction, these treatments reduce hyperpigmentation and restore skin tone [15, 25]. Similarly, vascular lasers targeting conditions such as rosacea and hemangiomas modulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promoting healthy angiogenesis while minimizing abnormal blood vessel formation. These effects demonstrate the versatile potential of lasers in regulating different skin pathologies via epigenetic mechanisms [26-28]. The therapeutic effects observed in treating pigmentary and vascular skin disorders align with the broader potential of lasers to modify cellular environments [29]. For example, DNA methylation can silence overactive pigment-producing genes in melanocytes, while histone acetylation promotes the expression of genes involved in vascular stability and repair [30, 31]. Such interventions offer long-lasting clinical benefits by reprogramming the skin's molecular landscape, highlighting the dual capability of lasers to address both aesthetic and pathological conditions [16]. As research in epigenetics continues to progress, the potential for personalized laser treatments based on individual epigenetic profiles is becoming increasingly feasible [32]. By analyzing a patient's unique epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation patterns or miRNA expression, dermatologists can tailor laser therapies to optimize clinical outcomes and predict treatment responses. The development of laser technologies that can selectively modulate epigenetic pathways also holds significant promise for enhancing regenerative effects while minimizing adverse outcomes, such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into this field is expected to further accelerate progress. AI's ability to process large data sets of genetic and epigenetic information will enable the identification of complex patterns and correlations, facilitating the development of predictive models for patient-specific laser treatment responses [33]. This integration of precision dermatology and AI-based analytics is poised to redefine clinical practice, offering unparalleled customization in laser-based interventions [34]. The intersection of epigenetics and medical lasers presents a new frontier in dermatology, with the potential to significantly enhance clinical outcomes in skin regeneration, aging, and pigmentation disorders. By influencing gene expression through controlled cellular stress, lasers can tap into the skin's innate regenerative processes, offering long-lasting improvements in skin health and appearance. As research into the epigenetic effects of laser treatments continues, the future holds more personalized, precise, and effective therapies that leverage the body's own epigenetic machinery to achieve optimal results. Incorporating an epigenetic perspective into laser therapy not only deepens our understanding of how these treatments work at a molecular level but also paves the way for innovations in skincare tailored to each individual's genetic and epigenetic profiles. This convergence of technology and biology has the potential to redefine dermatological care in the years to come. D.H. contributed to the conception, drafting, and writing of the manuscript.
