Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a vital strategy for achieving carbon neutrality by converting CO2 into high-energy-density, valuable chemical products, thereby facilitating carbon resource recycling and addressing environmental challenges. Herein, this paper emphasizes the role of CO2RR in diminishing the greenhouse effect through the transformation of CO2, with a particular focus on the latest advancements in Cu-based nanocatalysts, metal-organic framework (MOF)-based catalysts, and heteroatom-doped carbon materials, which are key innovations in achieving enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency and steering CO2 conversion pathways. The paper also outlines the electrochemical principles of CO2RR, and the spectrum of potential reduction products, and navigates through the challenges of stability and production costs. The paper proposes strategies to surmount these hurdles, highlighting the critical role of industrial collaborations and breakthroughs in materials science. Future research should aim to pinpoint cost-effective, efficient catalysts for CO2RR, contributing significantly to mitigating the greenhouse effect and propelling forward sustainable energy solutions.

Abstract In the past decades, the rapid depletion of non‐renewable energy sources has caused growing energy crisis and increasing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which aggravates global warming and catastrophic climate change. Electrocatalysis is regarded as an effective method for consuming atmospheric CO 2 and simultaneously alleviating the energy problem by converting CO 2 into high value‐added chemicals. Amorphous nanomaterials with long‐range disordered structures possess abundant highly unsaturated atomic sites and dangling bonds on their surfaces, thus providing a large number of active sites, and show unique electronic structures compared to their crystalline counterparts due to the distinct atomic arrangements. Therefore, amorphous nanomaterials are recently demonstrated as highly efficient catalysts for diverse electrocatalytic reactions, including electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Here the rational synthesis and electrocatalytic performance of newly emerging amorphous nanomaterials will be outlined for electrocatalytic CO 2 RR. Importantly, the intrinsic merits of these amorphous catalysts in CO 2 RR processes will be summarized and highlighted. Finally, these perspectives on the remaining challenges and some potential future directions in this emerging field will also be provided.

This chapter tackles the topic of the sonochemical reduction of CO2, starting from the fundamentals of the process, that is, the acoustic cavitation bubble, its oscillation, its collapse, and the evolution toward the adequate conditions for CO2 reduction. It also sheds light on the chemical mechanism susceptible to emerge within the acoustic cavitation bubble to explain the reduction of CO2 and its eventual conversions. Most importantly, the chapter reports the major findings of research works retrieved in the literature and highlights the debate around the use of ultrasounds as a promising technique from CO2 reduction, by presenting the most plausible explanations of the sonochemical process of CO2 reduction, both in terms of possibilities and limitations.

Abstract Electronic perturbation of Cu catalysts surface is crucial for optimizing electrochemical CO2 reduction activity, yet still poses great challenges. Herein, nanostructured Cu nanowires (NW) with fine-tuned surface electronic structure are achieved via surface encapsulation with electron-withdrawing (–F) and -donating (–Me) group-functionalized graphdiynes (R-GDY, R = –F and –Me), and the resulting catalysts, denoted as R-GDY/Cu NW, display distinct CO2 reduction performances. In-situ electrochemical spectroscopy revealed that the *CO (a key intermediate of the CO2 reduction reaction) binding affinity and consequent *CO coverage positively correlate to the Cu surface oxidation state, leading to the favorable C–C coupling on F-GDY/Cu NW over Me-GDY/Cu NW. Electrochemical measurements corroborate the favorable C2H4 production with an optimum C2+ selectivity of 73.15% ± 2.5% observed for F-GDY/Cu NW, while the predominant CH4 production is favored by Me-GDY/Cu NW. Furthermore, leveraging the *Cu–OH/*CO ratio as a descriptor, mechanistic investigation reveals that the protonation of distinct adsorbed *CO facilitated by *Cu–OH is crucial for the selective generation of C2H4 and CH4 on F-GDY/Cu NW and Me-GDY/Cu NW, respectively.

A copper porphyrin-derived metal-organic framework electrocatalyst, FICN-8, was synthesized and its catalytic activity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) was investigated. FICN-8 selectively catalyzed electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in anhydrous acetonitrile electrolyte. However, formic acid became the dominant CO2RR product with the addition of a proton source to the system. Mechanistic studies revealed the change of major reduction pathway upon proton source addition, while catalyst-bound hydride (*H) species was proposed as the key intermediate for formic acid production. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte composition on CO2RR product selectivity.

## A First-Principles Study on the Reaction Mechanisms of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C1 and C2 Products on Cu(110)

The mechanism of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction on a Cu(110) surface has yet to be fully revealed. In this work, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the mechanisms of the CO2 reduction reaction to produce C1 (including one C atom) and C2 (including two C atoms) products on a Cu(110) surface. The results show that CH4 and C2H5OH are the main C1 and C2 products on the Cu(110) surface, respectively. CH4 is produced along the pathway CO2 → COOH* → CO* → CHO* → CH2O* → CH3O* → CH4. C2H5OH is produced via the C-C coupling pathway between CO* and CH2O* intermediates, which is the key reaction step. This is because CO* and CH2O* coupling to CO-CH2O* has the lowest barrier among the CHxO* (x = 0–2) coupling pathways. Therefore, it is the most likely C-C coupling pathway. Further, CO-CH2O* is gradually hydrogenated to C2H5OH along the following pathway: CO-CH2O* → CHO-CH2O* → CHOH-CH2* → CH2OH-CH2* → CH2OH-CH3* → C2H5OH.

Abstract To boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), a unique synthetic method that deploys the in situ reduction of precoated precursors was developed to produce activated Ag nanoparticles (NPs) within the gas diffusion layer (GDL), where the thus-obtained Ag NPs-Skeleton could block direct contact between the active Ag sites and electrolyte. Specifically, compared to the conventional surface loading mode in the acidic media, our freestanding and binder free electrode could achieve obvious higher CO selectivity of 94%, CO production rate of 23.3 mol g-1 h-1, single-pass CO2 conversion of 58.6%, and enhanced long-term stability of 8 hours. Our study shows that delivering catalysts within the GDL does not only gain the desired physical protection from GDL skeleton to achieve a superior local microenvironment for more efficient pH-universal eCO2RR, but also manifests the pore structures to effectively address gas accumulation and flood issues, thereby stabilizing the catalysts.

Due to climate change risks, the public, regulators, and investors require solid actions to minimize the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of mineral extraction and metals production. The mining sector considers alternatives to reduce its carbon footprint by transforming the business and adopting new technologies into operations. Given the capital intensity, technical characteristics, and business structure involved, a shift in the mining industry necessitates impartial insights into the trade-offs and risks. Considering the low-carbon transition trade-offs and risks in mining, this study presents the application of system dynamics modeling (SDM) in mining projects to analyze the impact of decarbonization alternatives with respect to carbon footprint and costs. A system dynamics model of an open-pit copper mine is developed to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as capital and operational costs, during the project life cycle. The change in GHG emissions in the business-as-usual scenario with diesel equipment haulage versus the alternative scenario with electric overland conveyor haulage is compared concerning GHG emissions and associated costs. The results unequivocally demonstrated that electrifying material mobility offers significant decarbonization in open-pit mining if the on-site electricity has a low emission factor. The findings also indicate that the substantial cost difference between electrification and diesel alternatives is another major obstacle to implementing electrification in an open-pit copper mine. This research proves that implementing SDM in the mining industry can offer impartial insights into decision-making and enable a thorough evaluation of options using quantitative criteria. It effectively assesses and communicates the trade-offs and risks of transitioning to low-carbon alternatives because it analyzes project variables quantitatively and holistically and is easy to run.

As prominent oil producers, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have played a significant role in the global energy market. However, as the world’s attention increasingly shifts towards environmental sustainability, understanding the implications of the GCC’s economic activities on CO2 emissions becomes indispensable. This research paper investigates the relationship between specific economic indicators and their impact on CO2 emissions in the GCC from 2001 to 2021. This study employs quantile regression, a robust statistical method that estimates the conditional quantiles of a response variable given a set of predictor variables. The findings reveal several essential insights: Financial institution efficiency is significant and negative at a 1% level at the lower (10th, −83,537.3) and higher quantiles (90th, −549,002.3). The relationship between the GDP per capita and CO2 emissions varies across quantiles, highlighting the complexity of the growth–environment nexus. Total patents exhibit a positive and significant relationship with emissions, underscoring the importance of directing innovation towards environmentally sustainable solutions. Renewable energy consumption displays a nuanced relationship with CO2 emissions, with a more substantial negative impact observed at higher consumption levels. This underscores the potential of renewable energy to mitigate emissions when integrated at scale. This study’s outcomes hold crucial policy implications for GCC countries as they seek to align economic growth with environmental sustainability. The findings emphasize the importance of fostering financial institution efficiency, promoting green innovation, and expanding renewable energy sources to reduce emissions.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2RR) holds promise in mitigating atmospheric greenhouse gas levels but is hindered by low reaction kinetics, high energy barriers, and poor selectivity. To address these challenges, we developed a novel series of cost‐effective AgCu‐containing metal‐aerogel catalysts with high electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) using a top‐down reduction approach. The Ag85Cu15 aerogel, with an ECSA of 27.41 cm², achieved a Faraday efficiency (FE%) of 89.3% for CO production at ‐0.9 V vs. RHE. Increasing the Cu content to over 50% in the aerogel matrix produced small amounts of C2H4, with a maximum FE% of 12.9% at ‐1.0 V vs. RHE. To further enhance CO2 reduction efficiency, multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were incorporated into the Ag85Cu15 alloy aerogel via a hydrothermal treatment. The highly dispersed CNTs within the aerogel matrix increased the ECSA to 57.00 cm² by forming a well‐defined porous structure through van‐der Waals interactions, improving CO selectivity, and achieving a FE% of 98.6% at ‐0.7 V vs. RHE and a partial current density of 9.6 mA/cm² in an H‐cell. 86% of the initial FECO% was maintained during an 18 h test with continuous electrolysis.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas, and its resource use is vital for carbon reduction and neutrality. Herein, the nucleophilic addition reaction of calcium carbide (CaC2) to CO2 was studied for the first time to synthesize propiolic and butynedioic acids by using CuI or AgNO3 as catalyst, Na2CO3 as additive, and triphenylphosphine as ligand in the presence/absence of a hydrogen donor. The effects of the experimental conditions and intensification approach on the reaction were investigated. The reactivity of CaC2 is closely associated with its synergistic activation by the catalysts, solvent, and external intensification, such as the ultrasound and mechanical force. Ultrasound helps to promote the reaction by enhancing the interfacial mass transfer of CaC2 particulates. Mechanochemistry can effectively promote the reaction, yielding 29.8% of butynedioic acid and 74.8% of propiolic acid after 2 h ball milling at 150 rpm, arising from the effective micronization and interfacial renewal of calcium carbide. The present study sheds a light on the high-value uses of CO2 and CaC2 and is of reference significance for the nucleophilic reaction of CaC2 with other carbonyl compounds.

1.1. Aims Endoscopy units are resource intensive and contribute to a significant part of healthcare’s carbon footprint and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Sustainability measures is at the forefront of shifting towards carbon neutral endoscopy practices. In 2019, our department introduced an online endoscopy education video series to replace in person pre-procedural education, minimising patient travel associated emission. This study aims to quantify the reduction in pre-procedural travel-associated carbon dioxide emission using a digital health education intervention. 1.2. Methods Outpatient procedural activity between January 2019 to May 2022 at a single tertiary endoscopy unit was collated. Total distance of patient travel (kilometres) to hospital was calculated using postcode geodata coordinates between home postcodes to the hospital. The primary outcome was tonnes of CO2 emission averted from avoided travel.

The drive for carbon neutrality has led to legislative measures targeting reduced greenhouse gas emissions across the transportation, construction, and industry sectors. Renewable energy sources, especially solar and wind power, play a pivotal role in this transition. However, their intermittent nature necessitates effective storage solutions. Green hydrogen and ammonia have gained attention for their potential to store renewable energy while producing minimal emissions. Despite their theoretical promise of zero greenhouse gas emissions during production, real-world emissions vary based on system configurations and lifecycle assessments, highlighting the need for detailed evaluations of their environmental impact. Therefore, in this study, calculations were performed for the actual amount of produced greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with the production of green hydrogen using electrolysis, from raw material extraction and processing to hydrogen production, with these assessed from well-to-gate emission estimates. Emissions were also evaluated based on various types of renewable energy sources in South Korea, as well as hydrogen production volumes, capacities, and types. Using these data, the following factors were examined in this study: carbon dioxide emissions from the manufacturing stage of electrolysis equipment production, the correlation between materials and carbon dioxide emissions, and process emissions. Current grades of clean hydrogen were verified, and the greenhouse gas reduction effects of green hydrogen were confirmed. These findings are significant against the backdrop of a country such as South Korea, where the proportion of renewable energy in total electricity production is very low at 5.51%. Based on the domestic greenhouse gas emission efficiency standard of 55 kWh/kgH2, it was found that producing 1 kg of hydrogen emits 0.076 kg of carbon dioxide for hydropower, 0.283 kg for wind power, and 0.924 kg for solar power. The carbon dioxide emissions for AWE and PEM stacks were 8434 kg CO2 and 3695 kg CO2, respectively, demonstrating that an alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) system emits about 2.3 times more greenhouse gasses than a proton exchange membrane (PEM) system. This indicates that the total carbon dioxide emissions of green hydrogen are significantly influenced by the type of renewable energy and the type of electrolysis used.

Agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Biochar has been recommended as a potential strategy to mitigate GHG emissions and improve soil fertility and crop productivity. However, few studies have investigated the potential of biochar co-compost (BCC) in relation to soil properties, rice productivity, and GHG emissions. Therefore, we examined the potential of BC, compost (CP), and BCC in terms of environmental and agronomic benefits. The study comprised four different treatments: control, biochar, compost, and biochar co-compost. The application of all of the treatments increased the soil pH; however, BC and BCC remained the top performers. The addition of BC and BBC also limited the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) availability and increased soil organic carbon (SOC), which limited the GHG emissions. Biochar co-compost resulted in fewer carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, while BC resulted in fewer methane (CH4) emissions, which was comparable with BCC. Moreover, BC caused a marked reduction in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions that was comparable to BCC. This reduction was attributed to increased soil pH, nosZ, and nirK abundance and a reduction in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) abundance. The application of different amendments, particularly BCC, favored rice growth and productivity by increasing nutrient availability, soil carbon, and enzymatic activities. Lastly, BCC and BC also increased the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria, which favored plant growth and caused a reduction in GHG emissions. Our results suggest that BCC could be an important practice to recycle organic sources while optimizing climate change and crop productivity.

Air pollution is a critical issue impacting urban environments, leading to severe health problems and environmental degradation. This comprehensive review examines the potential of green systems—specifically green walls, active green walls, and urban greenery systems—to mitigate atmospheric pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon dioxide (CO2). By systematically analyzing 44 recent studies, this review highlights the pollutant capture efficiency of various green technologies and plant species in both indoor and outdoor settings. Active green walls, particularly those utilizing plant species such as Chlorophytum comosum and Sansevieria trifasciata, were found to be highly effective, with VOC reduction efficiencies of up to 96.34%, PM reductions of 65.42%, and CO2 reduction rates reaching 4.8% under optimal conditions. This review identifies key strengths in current research, including diverse experimental setups and the use of sophisticated measurement techniques, but also notes significant limitations such as variability in experimental conditions and a lack of long-term performance data. This study underscores the importance of proper maintenance to sustain green systems’ efficacy and highlights the potential issue of pollutant resuspension, which remains under-researched. Practical implications for urban planning are discussed, advocating for the integration of effective green systems into urban infrastructure to enhance air quality and public health. Recommendations for future research include the need for standardized metrics, long-term studies, economic feasibility analyses, and real-world validation of simulation models to better understand and optimize green systems for urban air pollution mitigation.

Abstract Both the global and the German climate targets are ambitious given recent emission reduction rates. In addition to emission reduction measures, carbon dioxide removal has been increasingly discussed recently and initial measures have been developed to potentially scale-up carbon removals in order to meet net zero targets. In this article, we undertake a political economy-based analysis of the historical development and structural conditions of German climate policy measures and their enabling role for the emergence and strengthening of carbon dioxide removal policy options. We refer to regulation theory and the Modell Deutschland approach and argue that within this model the concept of ecological modernization has been established as the dominant approach to regulate society-nature relations. In light of the ambitious climate policy goals, such as net zero by 2045, ecological modernization reaches its current limits and must be recalibrated. Against this background, we conclude by discussing the risk of mitigation deterrence associated with carbon dioxide removals and considering alternative pathways, such as degrowth, to social ecological transformation.

According to statistics, the carbon dioxide emissions from Chinas power industry account for about 40% of the total energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, while residential electricity consumption accounts for 36.6% of the total social electricity consumption. However, ordinary households have low electricity efficiency and serious waste. In the context of the national strategy of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, the Home Energy Management System (HEMS) has been introduced to improve household electricity efficiency, reduce electricity consumption, and achieve energy conservation and emission reduction while ensuring the comfort of residents. This article introduces the current research status of home energy management systems that take into account user comfort, and shows some optimization models for home energy management systems that take into account user comfort. It specifically elaborates on the optimization models for household appliances and comfort, briefly outlines the relatively trendy load prediction and scheduling optimization models, and proposes some suggestions and prospects for popularizing knowledge related to home energy management systems for family members using smart homes and temperature comfort modeling based on the current development status.

Abstract Net-zero commitments have become the central focal point for countries to communicate long-term climate targets. However, to this point it is not clear to what extent conventional emissions reductions and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will contribute to net-zero. An integrated market for emissions and removals with a uniform carbon price delivers the economically efficient contribution of CDR to net-zero, yet it might not fully internalise sustainability risks of CDR and hence could lead to its overuse. In this study, we explore the implications of separating targets for emission reductions and CDR for global net-zero emissions pathways with the Integrated Assessment Model REMIND. Even though it entails a deviation from the solution of the integrated market, we find that efficiency losses are moderate. Limiting CDR lowers the financial burden for public finance, limits reliance on geologic CO2 storage and leads to lower cumulative emissions, yet this increase in ambition comes at higher total mitigation costs.

To limit global warming, a rapid reduction in the carbon emissions from our buildings is required. Heating buildings contributed to 17 per cent of the UK overall carbon emissions in 2018 which is why it is important we look to decarbonise the heating systems that serve our buildings. In 2020, only 7.9 per cent of the energy to heat our buildings came from renewable sources. In the UK, existing heating is predominantly by natural gas. The most significant challenge is the rural buildings that are not served by mains gas but have oil supplies, due to the high carbon content of this fuel. The Diocese of Gloucester was invited to participate in a research project carried out by Historic England into viable methods of low and zero carbon heating in churches and their associated buildings. The focus of this research explores oil-fired heating systems as this fuel produces more carbon dioxide emissions than other fuels used to heat buildings. The key finding from this research is that no single heating technology is recommended for either all historic buildings or even each historic building type. Across the six case studies, air source heat pumps, biomass and electric heating were recommended in an equal proportion of cases. It is not possible to determine the most viable heating technology without carrying out a detailed technical feasibility study at the early concept stage of a project. The recommended heating technology depends on many factors including the building’s site and location, the size and form of the buildings, the use and operation of the buildings, the condition of the existing heating system and the existing utility infrastructure. The wider background to this research includes the 2030 net zero carbon target set by the Church of England and the UK government’s 2050 net zero carbon target.

With the acceleration of industrialization, the massive use of fossil fuels has led to a sharp increase in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide, triggering a series of environmental problems such as rising global temperatures, the frequency of extreme weather events and the degradation of ecosystems, which have had far-reaching impacts on the health of human societies, economic development, and natural ecosystems. To cope with this global problem, the international community has been actively seeking solutions. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement have made clear the international commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and emphasized the importance of controlling the rise in global average temperature. Carbon neutrality has become one of the key strategies to achieve the goals of these agreements, meaning reaching a net-zero goal for carbon emissions through emissions reduction and carbon offset activities. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices reflect the social responsibility of corporations and governments, and by integrating ESG principles, all parties can reduce their carbon footprints more efficiently, improve resource efficiency, and achieve sustainable development. This paper will explore the intersection of ESG and carbon-neutral strategies, analyze the effectiveness of their implementation in different subjects, and put forward specific recommendations for achieving the global carbon-neutral goal.

Abstract Modifying the chemical environment of active surfaces with ionic liquids (IL) is an emerging strategy for tailoring novel electrocatalytic systems, including carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR). Although copper (Cu) catalysts have recently gained more attention in this field, their modification with ILs is yet to be investigated. This work tested a range of common hydrophobic ILs impregnated into carbon‐supported Cu catalysts, following the “solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer” (SCILL) approach. The latter was used to showcase the applicability of real‐time product detection for CO 2 RR employing electrochemical mass spectrometry. The observed patterns of C 1 to C 3 product selectivity offered valuable insights into the intricate reaction mechanism. In addition, increasing the size of the IL cation showed an opposite and significant effect on the reaction selectivity. The obtained qualitative results were partially compared with conventional long‐term experiments.

Hydrogen is similar to natural gas in terms of its physical and chemical properties but does not release carbon dioxide when burnt. This makes hydrogen an energy carrier of great importance in climate policy, especially as an enabler of increasing integration of volatile renewable energy, progressive electrification, and effective emission reductions in the hard-to-decarbonize sectors. Leaving aside the problems of transporting hydrogen as a liquid, technological challenges along the entire supply chain can be considered as solved in principle, as shown in the experimental findings of the Hydrogen Innovation Program of the German Technical and Scientific Association for Gas and Water. By scaling up production and end-use capacities and, most importantly, producing hydrogen in regions with abundant renewable energy, hydrogen and its applications can displace natural gas at affordable prices in the medium term. However, this substitution will take place at different rates in different regions and with different levels of added value, all of which must be understood for hydrogen uptake to be successful.

Limiting global warming to close to 1.5°C by 2100 requires deep and rapid greenhouse gas emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals (CDR) on a massive scale, presenting a remarkable scaling challenge. This paper focuses on the financing of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in Sweden. BECCS is one of the most prominent CDR methods in 1.5°C-compatible global emission scenarios and has been assigned a specific role in Swedish policy for net-zero. A Swedish state support system for BECCS based on results-based payments is planned. Furthermore, demand for CDR-based carbon credits is on the rise on the voluntary carbon markets (VCM) for use towards voluntary mitigation targets. Risks involved with the current Swedish policies are analysed, specifically for the co-financing of BECCS by the planned state support and revenues from the VCM. We find that with the current policies, state support systems will subsidise carbon credit prices on the VCM. We argue that such subsidisation can lower decarbonisation efforts by lowering the internal carbon price set by actors, thus undermining environmental integrity. It is concluded that proportional attribution should be applied, i.e., attributing mitigation outcomes to the state support and VCM revenue in proportion to their financial contribution to the CDR achieved. The attribution analysis should be accompanied by adjustments in national greenhouse gas accounting so that mitigation outcomes that are issued as carbon credits and used for offsetting are not double claimed (i.e., not used by both a nation and a non-state actor on the VCM towards their respective mitigation targets). If proportional attribution and adjustments in national GHG accounting are not implemented, the credibility and environmental integrity of offsetting claims made by carbon credit users are eroded. We recommend that action is taken to operationalise and implement proportional attribution to allow for co-financing of BECCS projects while maintaining environmental integrity. Wider implications for our recommendations beyond the case of Swedish BECCS are also analysed.

Reducing the amount of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane released into the atmosphere is one of the causes of climate change, which is from actions such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and agricultural practices using renewable energy, such as solar energy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the model in depth of energy waqf (solar panel) on the issue of climate change. The data of this study was obtained through a literature study and evaluated in three steps: data reduction, data distribution, and conclusion drawn. The results of the study show that the waqf energy model (solar panel) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is because solar power plants built with waqf funds can produce safe electrical energy and do not emit greenhouse gases. Solar power plants built with waqf funds can be used to meet the needs of the community, such as households, SMEs, and industries. This can reduce people's dependence on fossil energy, which is an energy source that produces greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the energy waqf model (solar panels) can also generate economic and social benefits for the community.

Agricultural green development has become essential for sustainable agriculture and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. This study evaluates the total index of agricultural green development by applying the entropy method; it then examines the spatial–temporal evolution of agricultural green development and finally uses the panel quantile model to examine the driving factors of agricultural green development in China. The results indicate that the level of agricultural green development is rising with time, and the differences among the regions have not changed, showing an increasing direction from west to east. The results from the panel quantile regression with nonadditive fixed effects show that the driving factors have different impacts on agricultural green development across quantiles. Industrial structure upgrading, rural informatization, and agricultural marketization have more significant effects in provinces with higher agricultural green development; agricultural finance and the per capita GDP have greater impacts in provinces at a moderate level of agricultural green development; and technology development, rural informatization, and the urbanization rate play a more important role in provinces at a lower level of agricultural green development. Thus, each province should devise policies according to its level of agricultural green development, which would be beneficial in improving the policies’ effectiveness.

In this paper, Au and Cu nanoparticles were successfully loaded onto porous g-C3N4 material through a hydrothermal synthesis method. By adjusting the proportion of Cu, Au-5%Cu/C3N4, Au-10%Cu/C3N4, and Au-15%Cu/C3N4, catalysts were prepared and used for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol. Characterization analysis using high-resolution XPS spectra showed that with an increase in the doping amount of Cu, the electron cloud density on the Cu surface initially increased and then decreased. Electrons from Au atoms transferred to Cu atoms, leading to the accumulation of a more negative charge on the Cu surface, promoting the adsorption of partially positively charged C in CO2, which is more beneficial for catalyzing CO2. Among them, Au-10%Cu/C3N4 exhibited good reducibility and strong basic sites, as demonstrated by H2-TPR and CO2-TPD, with the conversion rates for CO2, methanol yield, and methanol selectivity being 11.58%, 41.29 g·kg−1·h−1 (0.39 μmol·g−1s−1), and 59.77%, respectively.

The relationship between economic factors and environmental impacts is of paramount significance in the pursuit of sustainable development and the implementation of effective measures to alleviate environmental deterioration. This research utilizes the VECM, FMOLS, CCR, and DOLS methodologies to examine the relationship between income inequality and CO2 emissions spanning from 1990 to 2022 in Turkey. Theoretical frameworks such as Boyce's socio-economic dynamics, Veblen's pecuniary emulation theory, and the marginal propensity to emit provide detailed insights into the complex relationship between economic inequality and environmental degradation. In synthesizing the literature on income inequality and CO2 emissions, we observe a wide spectrum of findings ranging from positive to negative associations, with some studies yielding inconclusive results in different nations and areas. Beyond income inequality, this research considers a wider range of CO2 explanatory factors, such as GDP per capita, industrial value added, energy consumption, renewable energy, population density, and the Gini index. The estimates reveal that income per capita, industrial value added, energy consumption, and population density show positive linkages with CO2 emissions. On the other hand, renewable energy share and income inequality reflect negative associations with CO2 emissions. Notably, an increase in the Gini coefficient, reflecting worse income distribution, is associated with a reduction in CO2 emissions in Turkey.

In tandem with these issues the UK has committed to making a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions. UK homes are currently responsible for almost 20 per cent of CO2 emissions. This leaves little option other than to make considerable progress with the retrofitting of homes to improve their energy performance. This is a technical process, however, and can introduce risks to building and their occupants. Examples exist of homes being retrofitted with disastrous consequences. Some of these issues can be due to the lack of thorough examination of a home before it undergoes a retrofit. This paper proposes a method that provides a detailed pre-retrofit assessment of a home, to fall in line with PAS 2035, a standard that provides guidance around publicly funded retrofit in the UK.

As the importance of sustainability is rising on the corporate agenda, companies need to provide environmental impact reduction plans to shareholders, banks and other stakeholders. The Paris Agreement urges companies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, to achieve the goal of maximum 1.5°C temperature increase. A benchmarking study of sustainability performance was conducted on the environmental reports of 59 companies, and their plans for emission reductions were analysed. From the results, a framework to define CO2 reduction targets to achieve net zero has been devised for companies, starting from now.

ABSTRACT This study presents a novel approach to integrating combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems with water desalination for enhanced energy and water management in educational buildings. Two distinct layouts for CCHP and desalination systems are introduced: one prioritizing efficient power generation to meet electricity demands while providing waste heat for desalination, and the other focusing on balancing cooling and heating loads alongside water desalination. Both layouts are tailored to meet the building's energy and water demands while considering operational efficiency. Optimization of these layouts against traditional systems using the bat search algorithm emphasizes economic viability and the gas engine's operational flexibility, which are crucial for partial load operation. In addition, an environmental assessment compares the proposed CCHP-desalination systems with conventional setups, assessing CO2 emission reductions and overall sustainability. The evaluation encompasses key environmental metrics, such as resource consumption and the integration of renewable energy sources. Results highlight significant CO2 emission reductions across various gas engine capacities, with notable enhancements in economic and environmental performance achieved by selecting a 3,250 kW gas engine within the CCHP-desalination system. This choice not only maximizes the annual profit but also reduces CO2 emissions by 57% compared to conventional systems, underscoring the system's sustainability benefits.

As oil and gas companies are one of the major greenhouse gas emitters, they face increasing responsibility to address climate challenges. This highlights the necessity of integrating decarbonization options into their operations to meet global climate objectives. While progress in technologies for capturing, utilizing, and storing CO2 (CCUS technologies) is often attributed to oil and gas companies, CCUS projects in the sector predominantly focus on carbon storage, namely CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery, which presents limited possibilities. Meanwhile, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies offer a promising avenue for producing valuable products from CO2, a potential that has been underexplored in theory and practice within the oil and gas sector. This study analyzes the development of the full CCU cycle by oil and gas companies, assessing the economic viability of such projects. It includes a content analysis of research materials on CCU deployment and a case study modeling the economic viability of producing methanol from CO2 in Russia. The findings indicate that the estimated minimum price for CO2-based methanol to achieve project payback is USD 1128 per ton, compared to approximately USD 400 per ton for traditional methanol. This price gap underscores the need to foster the development of low-carbon technologies, markets, and measures to support these projects. In the domain of CCU projects, cost-reduction measures could be more applicable, while regulatory measures, such as carbon taxes, currently have a limited impact on the economic viability of these projects.

The integrated CO2 capture and utilization coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (ICCU-RWGS) presents an alternative pathway for converting captured CO2 into CO in situ. This study investigates the effectiveness of three calcium-based materials (natural limestone, sol-gel CaCO3, and commercial CaCO3) as dual-functional materials (DFMs) for the ICCU-RWGS process at intermediate temperatures (650–750 °C). Our approach involves a fixed-bed reactor coupled with mass spectrometry and in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements to examine cyclic CO2 capture behavior, detailed physical and chemical properties, and morphology. The in situ FTIR results revealed the dominance of the RWGS route and exhibited self-catalytic activity across all calcium-based materials. Particularly, the natural limestone demonstrated a CO yield of 12.7 mmol g−1 with 100% CO selectivity and 81% CO2 conversion. Over the 20th cycle, a decrease in CO2 capture capacity was observed: sol-gel CaCO3, natural limestone, and commercial CaCO3 showed reductions of 44%, 61%, and 59%, respectively. This suggests inevitable deactivation during cyclic reactions in the ICCU-RWGS process, while the skeleton structure effectively prevents agglomeration in Ca-based materials, particularly in sol-gel CaCO3. These insights, coupled with the cost-effectiveness of CaO-alone DFMs, offer promising avenues for efficient and economically viable ICCU-RWGS processes.

Formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) catalyze the oxidation of formate to CO2 while reducing NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H and are classified into two main classes: metal‐dependent (Mo‐ or W‐containing) and metal‐independent FDHs. The latter are oxygen‐tolerant and relevant as a cofactor regeneration system for various bioprocesses and gained more and more attention due to their ability to catalyze the reverse CO2 reduction. This review gives an overview of metal‐independent FDHs, the recent advances made in this field, and their relevance for future applications in biocatalysis. This includes the exploitation of novel FDHs which have altered co‐substrate specificity as well as enzyme engineering approaches to improve process stability and general performance.

2D functional porous frameworks offer a platform for studying the structure‐activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to breakthrough key limitations on site configuration (typical M–O4 or M–N4 units) and product selectivity (common CO2‐to‐CO conversion). Herein, a novel 2D metal‐organic framework (MOF) with planar asymmetric N/O mixed coordinated Cu–N1O3 unit is constructed, labeled as BIT‐119. When applied to CO2RR, BIT‐119 could reach a CO2‐to‐C2 conversion with C2 partial current density ranging from 36.9 to 165.0 mA cm−2 in flow cell. Compared to the typical symmetric Cu–O4 units, asymmetric Cu–N1O3 units lead to the re‐distribution of local electron structure, regulating the adsorption strength of several key adsorbates and the following catalytic selectivity. From experimental and theoretical analyses, Cu−N1O3 sites could simultaneously couple the atop‐type (on Cu site) and bridge‐type (on Cu–N site) adsorption of *C1 species to reach the CO2‐to‐C2 conversion. This work broadens the feasible C−C coupling mechanism on 2D functional porous frameworks.

To non-destructively and rapidly monitor the chlorophyll content of winter wheat leaves under CO2 microleakage stress, and to establish the quantitative relationship between chlorophyll content and sensitive bands in the winter wheat growing season from 2023 to 2024, the leakage rate was set to 1 L/min, 3 L/min, 5 L/min, and 0 L/min through field experiments. The dimensional reduction was realized, fractional differential processing of a wheat canopy spectrum was carried out, a multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) estimation model was constructed using a SPA selection band, and the model’s accuracy was evaluated. The optimal model for hyperspectral estimation of wheat SPAD under CO2 microleakage stress was screened. The results show that the spectral curves of winter wheat leaves under CO2 microleakage stress showed a “red shift” of the green peak and a “blue shift” of the red edge. Compared with 1 L/min and 3 L/min, wheat leaves were more affected by CO2 at 5 L/min. Evaluation of the accuracy of the MLR and PLSR models shows that the MLR model is better, where the MLR estimation model based on 1.1, 1.8, 0.4, and 1.7 differential SPAD is the best for leakage rates of 1 L/min, 3 L/min, 5 L/min, and 0 L/min, with validation set R² of 0.832, 0.760, 0.928, and 0.773, which are 11.528, 14.2, 17.048, and 37.3% higher than the raw spectra, respectively. This method can be used to estimate the chlorophyll content of winter wheat leaves under CO2 trace-leakage stress and to dynamically monitor CO2 trace-leakage stress in crops.

The forthcoming implementation of national policies towards hydrogen blending into the natural gas grid will affect the technical and economic parameters that must be taken into account in the design of building heating systems. This study evaluates the implications of using hydrogen-enriched natural gas (H2NG) blends in condensing boilers and Gas Adsorption Heat Pumps (GAHPs) in a residential building in Rome, Italy. The analysis considers several parameters, including non-renewable primary energy consumption, CO2 emissions, Levelized Cost of Heat (LCOH), and Carbon Abatement Cost (CAC). The results show that a 30% hydrogen blend achieves a primary energy consumption reduction of 12.05% and 11.19% in boilers and GAHPs, respectively. The presence of hydrogen in the mixture exerts a more pronounced influence on the reduction in fossil primary energy and CO2 emissions in condensing boilers, as it enhances combustion efficiency. The GAHP system turns out to be more cost-effective due to its higher efficiency. At current hydrogen costs, the LCOH of both technologies increases as the volume fraction of hydrogen increases. The forthcoming cost reduction in hydrogen will reduce the LCOH and the decarbonization cost for both technologies. At low hydrogen prices, the CAC for boilers is lower than for GAHPs; therefore, replacing boilers with other gas technologies rather than electric heat pumps increases the risk of creating stranded assets. In conclusion, blending hydrogen into the gas grid can be a useful policy to reduce emissions from the overall natural gas consumption during the process of end-use electrification, while stimulating the development of a hydrogen economy.

Abstract Wetlands play an essential role in the global greenhouse gas budget via carbon dioxide sequestration as well as methane emission. In recent decades, solar‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been recognized as a remotely sensed proxy of gross primary productivity (GPP), which generates substrates for methane production. To examine the suitability of SIF for estimation of these two fluxes, we conducted ground tower‐based SIF observation with an ultrafine‐resolution spectroradiometer in conjunction with eddy covariance measurement in a cool‐temperate bog. The daily SIF retrieved in the red (687 nm) and far‐red (760 nm) bands (SIF red and SIF far‐red , respectively) increased nonlinearly with GPP and linearly with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). The relatively weak correlation between apparent SIF yield (ΦSIF = SIF/APAR) and light use efficiency implied that both APAR and plant physiology constrained the SIF emission in this wetland. The SIF red /SIF far‐red ratio showed a significant negative relationship with vegetation greenness indices, and the similar seasonal variation in SIF red and SIF far‐red indicated that the SIF red reabsorption effect only weakly influenced the SIF red –GPP relationship. Episodic temporal reduction in the water table did not distinctly influence SIF and ΦSIF. Estimation of the methane emission rate was subtly improved by incorporating SIF, which was substituted for GPP as the methanogenesis substrate, in a multivariable regression analysis together with two environmental factors: soil temperature and water table depth. This study illustrates the potential of both SIF red and SIF far‐red to monitor GPP and to predict methane emission in wetlands.

However, industrial carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions account for a large proportion of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which has a negative impact on the environment. To identify the factors affecting industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model system is established to empirically test the factors influencing industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, using data on industrial technology innovation (TI), environmental regulation, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 2000 to 2023 in China. The results show that there is a cointegration relationship between industrial technological innovation, environmental regulation and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Each unit increase in environmental regulation will reduce 2.132 units of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Meanwhile, each unit increase in technological innovation results in a decrease of 0.067 units of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Compared with TI, environmental regulation has a greater impact on CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction. The effects of the impulses of the stochastic perturbation terms of industrial TI, environmental regulation, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the current and future values of industrial TI, environmental regulation, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the VAR system are de-picted through the VAR impulse response function. The contribution of each new interest shock to the change of industrial TI, environmental regulation and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is analyzed by variance decomposition.

Urea (NH2CONH2) production by electrosynthesis at mild conditions has been hampered due to the lack of systematic evaluation of pathways in effectively activating inert N2 and CO2 molecules and facilitating the formation of C‐N bonds. This work, we evaluated 16 transition metal (M) atoms anchored on a carbon nitride nanosheet with boron (B) doping (M‐B@C2N) for boosting urea production by theoretical calculations. All possible urea synthesis pathways, (i) CO2 pathway, (ii) OCOH pathway, (iii) CO pathway, and (iv) NCON pathway, were comparatively studied on Cu, Fe, Co, Ni‐B@C2N. This systematic calculation identified that the first reduction of *N2 is the key step for urea synthesis. We found that the bond index of *N2 shows a strong correlation with ΔG*N2®*NNH, so they are promising descriptors for screening. Through the screening, we found that Nb‐ and Mo‐B@C2N show a low limiting potential of ‐0.56 and ‐0.53 V. Although previous studies found that spin could promote C‐C bond formation on M‐B@C2N, we found that for C‐N coupling, such effects by spin were only active for Nb‐B@C2N. Combining boron and early transition metal atoms allows for neighboring reaction sites that simultaneously donate electrons to activate inert N2 and CO2 for efficient urea synthesis.

Lateritic ore carbothermalreduction is currently the focus of many researchers. This process uses a relatively lower temperature of operation than the smelting. Therefore, the carbothermal reduction process has a relatively lower primary energy demand and CO2 gas emissions. This research examines the appropriate briquette form to obtain the optimum recovery, concentration of nickel, and selective reduction of nickel, as well as analyzes the compounds/phases formed. The briquette in this study was formed into three different geometries, i.e., the pillow, spherical, and cylindrical forms. First, this research was carried out by mixing the raw materials and forming it into specified briquette forms. Second, the formed briquettes were put into a crucible. Third, the coal-limestone bed mixture was used to cover the briquettes. Then, the carbothermic reduction process was started by heating to 700 oC for 2 hours and continued to 1400 oC for 6 hours. Finally, the magnetic separation process was performed to separate the reduced briquettes. As a result, the cylindrical shape briquette obtained better results at 6.74% Ni, with a nickel recovery of 96.20% and a selectivity factor value of 10.39. The compounds formed after carbothermic reduction process products include FeNi, Fe3Si, and SiO2. In a spherical-shaped briquette, Fe3O4 and Mg2SiO4were found in the reduced product, indicating impurities in the reduced briquettes.

Since 2010, there has been an approximate annual increase of 1% in CO2 emissions due to buildings. The reduction of energy consumption and consequently the mitigation of Greenhouse Gases are global goals due to the global issue of climate change. A key step in achieving these goals is to improve the energy performance of buildings, thereby reducing energy consumption and emissions generated by the built environment. In this regard, the present research focuses on identifying and estimating strategies to reduce energy consumption in buildings known as Community Police Units (UPCs) located in the city of Guayaquil, which corresponds to a very hot and humid climate zone. The study consists of statistical analysis of the historical energy performance of 43 buildings sharing the same architectural design. Additionally, the selection of a representative building was made for energy use monitoring and energy simulation. The results revealed a potential saving of 16 000 kWh per year by reducing the control temperature of the air conditioning system by 1°C and adjusting the on/off schedule. This is equivalent to 1 150 USD and 5 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

The study was carried out to evaluate theoretically and in laboratory conditions the capacity of a hybrid heating and cooling system that sustainably uses thermal energy extracted from surface waters in order to decarbonize buildings located near water sources. The novelty of the research consists in the realization of two experimental systems, one for the rapid evaluation of the performance of the water–water heat pump heating system and one for the evaluation of the operating behavior of a cooling system with fan coil units. Starting with the heating and cooling demand, and the climatic and hydrological local characteristics, a hybrid system model for the heating and cooling of the analyzed building was established and implemented. The forecasted energy consumption and CO2 emissions for the operation of the new equipment were compared with the historical values of the old systems with which the building was equipped (thermal energy supply from the district heating and cooling system with an air conditioning unit). Also, the results were extrapolated for forecasting the energy potential of the surface waters. The study highlights a percentage reduction in annual energy consumption of 67.71% and CO2 emissions of 80.13% through the implementation of the hybrid system.

Одной из ключевых целей, включенных в Повестку в области устойчивого развития на период 2030 года, является принятие срочных мер по борьбе с изменением климата и его последствиями. В статье проанализированы сущность, особенности, предпосылки формирования тренда на низкоуглеродную экономику и необходимость ограничения глобального потепления на 1,5°C, что, в свою очередь, невозможно без немедленного и глубокого сокращения выбросов во всех секторах. При этом в настоящее время многие национальные и субнациональные юрисдикции и компании ищут новые методы сокращения выбросов парниковых газов, прежде всего CO2, стремясь одновременно решить две задачи, которые противоречат друг другу: снизить воздействие на климат планеты и сохранить экономическую конкурентоспособность. One of the key goals included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. The article analyzes the essence, features, prerequisites for the formation of a trend towards a low-carbon economy and the need to limit global warming by 1.5°C, which, in turn, is impossible without an immediate and deep reduction in emissions in all sectors. At the same time, many national and subnational jurisdictions and companies are currently looking for new methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily CO2, trying to simultaneously solve two problems that contradict each other: reduce the impact on the planet's climate and maintain economic competitiveness.

Owing to the tunable electronic properties, high carrier lifetimes, low recombination possibility, and long diffusion lengths, perovskites have gained attention for potential use in photoelectrocatalytic processes. Photoelectrochemical methods can convert sunlight into electricity or useful fuels, resulting in extensive research to develop PEC applications. This chapter embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the perovskite structure’s transformative influence on diverse photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) and monolithic Photovoltaic-Electrocatalytic (PV-EC) devices including water splitting, H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, degradation of pollutants, (bio) sensing, and organic synthesis. By assessing the mechanisms and kinetics involved, we aim to disclose the potential of perovskite-based photoelectrochemical systems in shaping the landscape of green energy and environmental stewardship. Furthermore, the chapter addresses the progress and challenges in enhancing the stability, selectivity, and efficiency of perovskite-based PEC and monolithic PV-EC reactions to unravel the synergistic potential for sustainable transformations in the realm of photoelectrochemistry.

Climate change poses an unprecedented global challenge, which prompts nations to adopt new strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union emissions trading system (EU ETS) is a cornerstone of the EU’s efforts towards a cost-effective fight against climate change. This study examines the effectiveness of the EU ETS by analyzing monthly data from December 2008 to December 2021, with the focus on CO2 emission allowance futures prices, renewable energy indices, coal prices, oil prices, and fossil energy indices. The key findings are as follows: The CO2 emission allowance futures prices have averaged EUR 14.83 per ton, ranging from EUR 2.87 to EUR 76.81, which shows a significant upward trend. The renewable energy index also demonstrated strong growth, with a mean 1562.07 and maximum 4571.96. Coal prices have averaged EUR 65.32 per ton, while Brent oil prices averaged EUR 59.85 per barrel. A cointegration analysis revealed a long-run equilibrium relationship between these variables. The Vector Error Correction model (VECM) revealed significant negative responses to long-run equilibrium deviations of the renewable energy index (−0.0155) and oil prices (−0.0236), a significant negative short-run response of CO2 prices to their own lagged values (−0.223), and a significant positive short-run effect of oil prices on the fossil energy index (0.254). These results suggest the EU ETS has created significant linkages between carbon, energy, and financial markets. The study concludes that while the EU ETS has made progress in motivating emissions reductions and promoting renewable energy, the system’s efficacy still needs improvement.

Abstract: Palladium-catalyzed carbonylative cross-coupling reactions with various carbon monoxide (CO) sources cultivate competent routes for the synthesis of bulk and value-added chemicals. However, the practical use of this odorless, inflammable, lethal gas has always raised a concern for chemists. The attention and advancement of various CO-surrogates is surely wel-comed as a green alternative to CO-gas. However, the main concern lies in the suitability and scalability of these CO-surrogate-driven reactions. Literature showed the progress of various ways to make in-situ CO from these CO surrogates. One of the most convenient sources is using metal carbonyls which are already known to lose CO easily. Among all the kinds, Mo(CO)6 gained much popularity but its toxic nature and demand for high temperatures restricted its use. However, Co2(CO)8 is popular as a catalyst but as an in-situ CO-source reports are scarce. This low-melting CO-releaser was found effective in flourishing aminocarbonylation, alkoxycar-bonylation, and reductive carbonylation under mild conditions. This mini-review portrays the recent developments of palladium-catalyzed carbonylation reactions using Co2(CO)8 as a CO source.

Measuring the sticking coefficient of molecules pertinent to astrochemistry - such as CO - on substrates that mimic interstellar dust grains is crucial for the comprehensive understanding of gas-grain chemical processes. Although astrochemical models assume a sticking coefficient of 1, recent laboratory experiments on H2O and CO2 have revealed significantly lower values when measured on small grain analogs. As the effect of grain size on molecular adsorption has been largely ignored to date, further experiments are needed to determine the accretion rates of species known to freeze out on dust grains. Our aim is to determine the sticking coefficients of CO and N2 on sub-micrometric silicate and carbon grains. By quantifying realistic sticking coefficients on these dust grain analogs, we can improve the accuracy of astrochemists' predictions of molecular abundances as affected by gas-grain interactions. The molecules of interest were added to various substrates at 10 K in an ultra-high vacuum. The amount of adsorbate that stuck to the substrate was quantified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These quantities were compared to a reference with a sticking coefficient of 1, allowing the deduction of the sticking coefficient for each substrate. The average sticking coefficients of CO and N2 on grain analogs are 0.17 for CO and 0.14 for N2 on olivine powder, and 0.05 for CO and 0.07 on N2 on soot, instead of the presumed 1. This is in line with the low values previously reported for H2O and CO2 These laboratory results indicate that CO and N2 in addition to H2O and CO2 also exhibit a low sticking coefficient on dust grain analogs. It is thus necessary to reconsider the interactions between gaseous species and dust particles as a low-efficiency process. This reduction in accretion and reaction rates has important implications for how we understand astrochemistry.

Broiler farming is a significant source of gaseous emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different litter additives on the emission of NH3, N2O, CO2, and CH4 during broiler housing and subsequent manure storage. The gaseous emissions from the housing facilities were evaluated during one fattening cycle in environmentally controlled rooms with three different additives applied to the litter material (10% w/w aluminum sulphate or biochar and 2.50 mg m−2 urease inhibitor), as well as a control. A storage experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions for 90 days to evaluate the influence of these three additives on gaseous losses. During broiler housing, the results indicated that NH3 emissions were reduced significantly (40–60%) by litter additives, while global warming potential (GWP) emissions were reduced significantly (31%) by Alum. The addition of Biochar (a 58% reduction) had the same significant effect as Alum (a 60% reduction) to mitigate these losses. The re-application of Urease (a 41% reduction) may be required to reach an equal or higher reduction. During storage, NH3 and GWP emissions were not significantly affected by the litter additives. During broiler housing and subsequent manure storage, NH3 emissions were reduced significantly (22–41%) by litter additives, whereas GWP emissions did not decrease significantly. Globally, it can be concluded that Biochar appears to be a good alternative to Alum due to its equal effectiveness in mitigating NH3 losses, without increasing the GWP potential in the housing and avoiding pollution swapping.

The environmental control of crop physiology increases relative sensitivity of crop water movement within the soil plant atmosphere continuum (SPAC), so as the dynamics of crop water usage under modified climate. The variable environmental conditions determine the relative direction of change. Elevated CO2 exposure depressed the water movement of transpiration flux through reduced stomatal conductance and facilitated partial stomatal closure. However, the net impact may not be ensued the significant reduction in crop water usage at the end of crop season due to modified leaf area dynamics, but with obvious rise in crop water use efficiency (WUE). Thermal stresses are often combined with drought events depressed crop WUE beyond a threshold sourced from adverse impact on total dry matter production under elevated temperature condition. The pathogenic role of O3 exposure induced stomatal sluggishness and reduction in dry matter accumulation (or yield) are sourced from reduced photosynthetic assimilation and aberration in stomatal conductance and thereby reduction in crop WUE under well-watered condition. However, the protective roles of other co-existing abiotic stress factors are subjected to more explanatory research. However, the genetic resilience toward such climate change induced abiotic stress factors and supportive field management options will provide our future facets of sustainable crop production with higher WUE crop under variable environmental conditions.

It was studied an influence of prior carbon treatment (temperature and gas conditions, mass content of waterproofing agent) on activity of platinum catalyst, synthesized on disperse carbon carrier. It was shown that characteristics of anodic processes depend on quantity of solid polymer electrolyte in catalytic composition. Optimal content of ion exchange polymer under varied degree of carbon carrier waterproofing (used for synthesis of platinum catalyst) is not equal. In a case of platinum catalyst synthesized on a base of carbon carrier with the addition of waterproofing agent (10 mass %), the highest current density of fuel cell functioning on pure oxygen corresponds to 15-20 mass % of polymer content in a layer and in a case of air – 10-15 mass %. Impurity of carbonic gas in anodic fuel leads to decrease of current density on fuel cell withdrawal not only because of partial pressure decrease. The reason of parameter worsening is partial platinum poisoning with CO, appearing after CO2 reduction.

Building operations account for a large amount of energy use and CO2 emissions, and the morphology of buildings in residential clusters strongly impacts energy efficiency performance. However, little research has focused on the morphology and energy electricity usage of high-rise residential clusters in hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) regions. We investigated 96 residential clusters in Hangzhou, China, and established a corresponding morphology database. Additionally, we obtained annual electricity consumption for 16 of these residential clusters. With this database, we performed optimization of morphological parameters upon energy use intensity (EUI) using a genetic algorithm (GA). Specifically, the cooling, heating, and lighting EUIs of high-rise residential clusters were studied. After implementing the optimized morphological parameters, there was a reduction of up to 7.73% in EUI. According to regression analysis, the average aspect ratio was the most significant factor influencing EUI (r = −0.907), followed by floor area ratio (r = −0.755), average orientation (r = 0.502), and average number of floors (r = −0.453). These results indicate that a higher intensity of land development with a greater floor area ratio, average aspect ratio, and average number of floors can reduce total energy consumption. Additionally, we found that an average building orientation of southwest 15° (with respect to south) is optimal. The findings of this study can assist urban planners and designers in developing more sustainable residential clusters, leading to decreased energy costs and CO2 emissions.    

    

## Potential for surplus-heat-to-power conversion in current and future aluminium production process with off-gas recycling

Increased utilization of industrial surplus heat can make significant contributions towards reaching energy efficiency and emissions reduction goals. The off-gas from metal production smelters can contain large amounts of thermal energy, and conversion to electric power often appears an enticing prospect. However, the practical potential for exploitation can be significantly reduced from plant processes that are designed considering surplus heat as a waste product to get rid of. This typically makes the heat accessible only at reduced temperatures. The HighEFF research centre for industrial energy efficiency has studied technologies, applications, and cases for surplus heat utilization since its start in 2016. Heat-to-power conversion has been explored in several cases provided by the partner industries from – among others – Norwegian aluminium manufacturers. Centre research activities also include novel production processes and modifications, which has side effects providing very different conditions and constraints for energy recovery. One such process modification is off-gas recirculation, mainly developed to increase concentration of CO2 in the off-gas to improve conditions for CO2 capture in the future, but which also will alter off-gas temperature and recoverable heat as a side effect. This could improve the potential for energy recovery. In this work, the potential for energy recovery is evaluated and compared in four cases – one representing a current aluminium process, and three future process scenarios with flue gas recycling. The simulated heat-to-power conversion is done by applying an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) optimization model to each case. The results indicate significant benefits to energy recovery in the recycling cases. In the case with the highest recycling rate and flue gas temperature, the potential for electric power production increases by 270 % compared to the present-day case. In addition, the reduced work of the main exhaust fans in the recycling cases brings further energy savings on the system level equivalent to 25–50 % of the ORC power output, further increasing overall energy efficiency. From this, some potential synergies between process design, heat-to-power, and thermal integration of other technologies such as CO2-capture are discussed.

Importance Understanding potential predisposing factors associated with spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) may influence its management. Objective To describe a severe case of SANS associated with 2 potentially predisposing factors. Design, Setting, and Participants Ocular testing of and blood collections from a female astronaut were completed preflight, inflight, and postflight in the setting of the International Space Station (ISS). Exposure Weightlessness throughout an approximately 6-month ISS mission. Mean carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) partial pressure decreased from 2.6 to 1.3 mm Hg weeks before the astronaut’s flight day (FD) 154 optical coherence tomography (OCT) session. In response to SANS, 4 B-vitamin supplements (vitamin B 6 , 100 mg; L-methylfolate, 5 mg; vitamin B 12 , 1000 μg; and riboflavin, 400 mg) were deployed, unpacked on FD153, consumed daily through FD169, and then discontinued due to gastrointestinal discomfort. Main Outcomes and Measures Refraction, distance visual acuity (DVA), optic nerve, and macular assessment on OCT. Results Cycloplegic refraction was −1.00 diopter in both eyes preflight and +0.50 − 0.25 × 015 in the right eye and +1.00 diopter in the left eye 3 days postflight. Uncorrected DVA was 20/30 OU preflight, 20/16 or better by FD90, and 20/15 OU 3 days postflight. Inflight peripapillary total retinal thickness (TRT) peaked between FD84 and FD126 (right eye, 401 μm preflight, 613 μm on FD84; left eye, 404 μm preflight, 636 μm on FD126), then decreased. Peripapillary choroidal folds, quantified by surface roughness, peaked at 12.7 μm in the right eye on FD154 and 15.0 μm in the left eye on FD126, then decreased. Mean choroidal thickness increased throughout the mission. Genetic analyses revealed 2 minor alleles for MTRR 66 and 2 major alleles for SHMT1 1420 (ie, 4 of 4 SANS risk alleles). One-week postflight, lumbar puncture opening pressure was normal, at 19.4 cm H 2 O. Conclusions and Relevance To the authors’ knowledge, no other report of SANS documented as large of a change in peripapillary TRT or hyperopic shift during a mission as in this astronaut, and this was only 1 of 4 astronauts to experience chorioretinal folds approaching the fovea. This case showed substantial inflight improvement greater than the sensitivity of the measure, possibly associated with B-vitamin supplementation and/or reduction in cabin CO 2 . However, as a single report, such improvement could be coincidental to these interventions, warranting further evaluation.

Synthetic biohybrid systems by coupling artificial system with nature’s machinery may offer a disruptive solution to address the global energy crisis. We developed a versatile electroenzymatic pathway for the continuous synthesis of valuable chemicals, facilitated by formate‐driven NADH regeneration. Utilising a bismuth electrocatalyst, we achieved stable CO2 reduction to formate with approximately 90% Faraday efficiency at a current density of 150 mA cm−2. The generated formate acts as a mediator to regenerate NADH, which is then coupled with immobilised redox enzymes—alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), L‐lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and L‐glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)—to produce targeted chemicals at significant rates and exceptionally high turnover numbers (1.8×106 to 3.1×106). These achievements not only underscore the efficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in industrial settings. By leveraging in situ generated formate, this innovative approach demonstrates the potential of integrating electrocatalysis with enzymatic reactions for sustainable and efficient chemical production on a practical scale.

High-resolution monitoring systems are commonly used to calculate mechanical and energy performance, as well as environmental impact resulting from the operation of a fleet of vehicles in a region. These systems require recording operational or vehicle position data, energy consumption in the case of electric or electric-assisted vehicles, and buttons for specific signals in the operation, such as the start of operation, end of operation, or package delivery. Some vehicle tracking devices available on the market do not allow speed and energy consumption data to be recorded and accessed at the required sampling frequency. This study presents the development and validation of a remote sensing device to record energy consumption and operational variables of a vehicle under real operating conditions with a frequency of 1 Hz. The functioning of the device, the integrated elements in its development, and the data analysis process are detailed. Finally, using the monitoring equipment data, a comparison was made between the operation of electric vehicles and internal combustion vehicles, achieving savings of up to 83% in operating costs and a 79% reduction in CO2 emissions.

Climate change is a serious hazard that has already harmed urban and natural systems and resulted in over $500 billion in economic losses worldwide.These problems could be partially resolved by artificial intelligence,which incorporates internet resources to provide quick recommendations based on precise climate change projections.Our research revealed that raising energy efficiency can greatly lessen the effects of climate change.Smart manufacturing, in instance, can reduce energy consumption in buildings by 30 to 50 percent.It can also reduce waste and carbon emissions by 30 to 50 percent.Artificial intelligence technologies are used by almost 70% of the world's natural gas industry to improve the precision and dependability of weather forecasts. Artificial intelligence and smart grids can be used to maximise power system efficiency and cut electricity costs by 10–20%.Intelligent transport systems have a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions potential. Furthermore,artificial intelligence may be used to manage natural resources and build resilient cities, further advancing sustainability.

Sustainable technologies to replace current fossil solutions are essential to meet future CO2 emission reduction targets. Therefore, this paper compares key performance indicators of a hydrogen- and a methane-flame-fired crucible furnace with computational fluid dynamics simulations at identical firing powers, aiming to fully decarbonize the process. Validated numerical models from the literature were used to compare temperatures, radiation fields, radiation parameters and heat transfer characteristics. As a result, we observed higher combustion temperatures and a 19.0% higher fuel utilization rate in the hydrogen case, indicating more efficient operating modes, which could be related to the increased radiant heat flux and temperature ranges above 1750 K. Furthermore, higher scattering of the heat flux distribution on the crucible surface could be determined indicating more uneven melt bath temperatures. Further research could focus on quantifying the total fuel consumption required for the heating up of the furnace, for which a transient numerical model could be developed.

Sensitivity to ambient air temperatures, consuming a large amount of fuel, and wasting a significant amount of heat dumped into the ambient atmosphere are three major challenges facing gas turbine power plants. This study was conducted to simultaneously solve all three aforementioned GT problems using solar energy and introducing a new configuration that consists of solar preheating and inlet-air-cooling systems. In this study, air was preheated at a combustion chamber inlet using parabolic trough collectors. Then, inlet air to the compressor was cooled by these collectors by operating an absorption cooling cycle. At the design point conditions, this novel proposed integration resulted in a 6.87% relative increase in generated power and a 10.53% relative decrement in fuel consumption, achieving a 19.45% relative increment in the plant’s thermal efficiency. This was accompanied by a reduction of 0.026 kg/s, 4.2 kg/s, and 0.278 kg/s in CO2, CO, and NOx emissions, respectively. Finally, spider diagrams were employed to assess the impact of the operating parameters on the overall system’s performance and its associated environmental implications.

Although the thermodynamic potential of transcritical/supercritical CO2-based power cycles for next generation Concentrated Solar Power plants has been already confirmed in literature, further investigation to assess the actual feasibility of this technology from a techno-economic standpoint is needed. In fact, large uncertainty is found when it comes to the estimation of the CAPEX and OPEX of the power block, and the same can be said for the solar subsystem when high Turbine Inlet Temperatures are considered (>700 ºC). Bearing this in mind, this paper presents a methodology to map the techno-economic potential of nextgeneration Concentrated Solar Power plants running on CO2-based mixtures, with the final aim to identify the threshold (breakeven) costs of the main subsystems enabling a clear gain in terms of Levelised Cost of Electricity with respect to state-of-the-art steam-based CSP. Two different systems are studied which differ in the composition and peak temperature of the Heat Transfer Media: a SoA molten salts system operating at a TIT of 550 ºC (Gen I) and a solid particle system with TIT=700 ºC (Gen II). An integrated platform able to simulate all CSP plant subsystems and perform hourly calculations is built in Matlab employing Artificial Neural Networks to simulate the solar field, ensuring extremely high computational speed. To overcome the high uncertainty in terms of cost estimation, a two-step analysis is developed: firstly, the CAPEX of the entire plant is calculated assuming correlations from literature, except for the power block, whose estimate brings about the largest uncertainty. As a result, the minimum power block cost allowing a LCoE lower than a certain target is identified. Secondly, an inverse methodology is applied, setting the power block cost and assessing the minimum CAPEX of the solar subsystem. As a result, a map is obtained showing the target CAPEX to be accomplished by sCO2+CSP if a clear reduction of the LCoE of this technology is to be achieved.

This study aimed to investigate the presence of biofilm-forming bacteria within high sulfide sludge obtained from a rubber wastewater treatment plant and assess their suitability for application within a BioCircuit System (BCS) as a symbiotic community for treating nutrient-rich wastewater. The sludge samples were collected and subjected to microbial culture techniques, wherein pure cultures were isolated based on morphological characteristics observed under a light microscope, followed by assessment of motility using swarm agar. Subsequent identification was conducted utilizing the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method, and the isolated bacteria were introduced into the BCS. A 12 mL microbial fuel cell test was conducted to evaluate their power generation capabilities. The wastewater treatment process involved inoculating the BCS with 20% crude rubber wastewater sludge, and the system was initiated at a flow rate of 0.5 L/min for a month. Upon achieving an open-circuit voltage exceeding 50 mV, the BCS was operated at incremental flow rates (0.5-1.0, 1.0-1.5, and 1.5-2.0 mL/ min) over a period of 6 months. Real-time monitoring of voltage, flow rate, and energy consumption was facilitated through an internet-of-things online program. Weekly sampling and analysis of influent and effluent, focusing on chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulfate, and sulfide concentrations, were conducted. Additionally, the BioCircuit voltage was recorded every 5 minutes. The results revealed the presence of six group-forming shaped bacteria identified as Bacillus tequilensis, Bacillus sp., Ferribacterium limneticum, Bacillus weihenstephanesis, and Mycobacterium sp., respectively. The optimal flow rate of 1.5 L/min yielded a maximum voltage of 1.2 V and demonstrated high wastewater treatment efficiency. Economically, the BCS operation exhibited a power consumption rate of 0.257 kWhr/m3 of treated wastewater, leading to an 88.90% reduction in carbon footprint compared to aerated lagoon treatment, equivalent to 50.94 kg CO2/m3 of treated wastewater or 183,384 kg CO2/yr for a 10 m3 plant. These findings underscore the potential of the BCS in conjunction with group-forming shaped bacteria communities for various industrial wastewater treatment applications.

Various soil management techniques can be used to sequester carbon in agricultural fields. With widespread implementation, these methods could sequester a substantial amount of carbon. For the purpose of removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil, various management techniques exist. The efficacy of these tactics varies depending on the region, soil type, and climate. The longevity of soil sequestration and the ideal circumstances for maximising the reduction of carbon emissions remain topics of discussion. This essay examines the process by which soil stores carbon, the current status of soil carbon research, and the controversy surrounding the potential of soil carbon. It emphasises the numerous side advantages of raising soil carbon and provides a set of suggestions for further investigation. A substantial amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) might be sequestered by switching from conventional to conservation tillage, although this change would only have a long-term impact on tillage practices. Crop rotation based on legumes is more effective than that based on grass in converting biomass carbon to soil organic carbon. Rotational grazing lowers the overall quantity of CO2 released into the atmosphere while improving the quality of the grass. Producing biochar and incorporating it into soil is an additional strategy for storing carbon from the atmosphere.

Pollution generated by the automotive sector is one of the biggest concerns in the city of Quito. This is due to the fact that the majority of vehicles in the automotive fleet use fossil fuels as a source of propulsion energy. In addition, the heterogeneity of the technologies of the fuel injection systems means that the control of polluting emissions is highly limited. On the other hand, due to the high number of vehicles and the topographical characteristics of the city, high traffic congestion is generated during rush hours, producing abrupt changes in acceleration and reduction of stoichiometric mixtures. Based on the above, it was pertinent to compare the exhaust gas emissions that are produced in high and low vehicular congestion for a vehicle with an internal combustion engine Likewise, the correlations of the gases for both scenarios were determined. To do this, emissions were measured in a Mazda 3 vehicle on a major city route during rush hours and on weekends. A Kane Autoplus gas analyzer was used for exhaust gas measurement, and data logging was done on the Kane Live app. The results showed that in rush hours, the vehicle emits higher amounts of CO2, CO, and HC up to 0.7%; 128.5%; and 65.5%, respectively. There are moderate and strong correlations of O2-CO2 and CO-HC in high and low vehicular congestion, with Pearson’s correlation values greater than 0.5. Keywords: exhaust gases, internal combustion engine, pollution, route, rush hours, traffic. Resumen La contaminación generada por el sector automotriz, es uno de los mayores problemas que enfrenta la ciudad de Quito. Esto se debe a que la mayoría de vehículos del parque automotor, utilizan combustibles fósiles como fuente de energía de propulsión. Además, la heterogeneidad de las tecnologías de los sistemas de inyección de combustible, hace que el control de emisiones contaminantes se limite considerablemente. Por otro lado, debido al elevado número de vehículos y a las características topográficas de la ciudad, se genera una elevada congestión vehicular en horas pico, produciendo cambios abruptos de aceleraciones y reducción de las mezclas estequiométricas. Con base a lo expuesto, fue pertinente comparar las emisiones de gases de escape que se producen en alta y baja congestión vehicular para un vehículo con motor de combustión interna, y así mismo, se determinó las correlaciones de los gases para ambos escenarios. Para ello, se midió las emisiones en un vehículo Mazda 3 sobre una ruta importante de la ciudad en horas pico y fines de semana. Se utilizó un analizador de gases Kane Autoplus para la medición de los gases de escape, y el registro de datos se efectuó en la aplicación Kane Live. Los resultados mostraron que en horas pico, el vehículo emite mayores cantidades de CO2, CO, HC de hasta el 0,77%; 6,66%; 94,69%, respectivamente. Existen moderadas y fuertes correlaciones de O2-CO2 y CO-HC en alta y baja congestión vehicular, con valores de correlación de Pearson superior a 0,5. Palabras Clave: contaminación, gases de escape, horas pico, motor de combustión interna, ruta, tráfico.

Abstract Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as effective substrates for immobilizing molecular catalysts towards many electrocatalytic reactions, such as CO2 reduction (CO2R). However, despite the prevailing notion of strong π-π stackings between the molecular catalyst and CNTs, our understanding of their interactions remains inadequate. Here, we employ functionalized nickel phthalocyanines (NiPc), established CO2R catalysts, immobilized on CNTs as a model system to investigate the catalyst/substrate interactions. Firstly, we find that NiPc-catalysts preferentially anchor on the defects on CNTs rather than adhering via π-π interaction with the ideal graphene-like CNT surface, a finding further validated by theoretical simulations. Consequently, we observe the least uniform NiPc-catalysts distributions on CNTs when the defect-content is the lowest. Notably, this combination exhibits the highest CO2R selectivity and activity despite the non-uniform catalyst distributions. Through operando X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations, we reveal that high CNT defect-contents tend to induce substantial D4h symmetry breaking of the NiPc plane under cathodic potential, consequently resulting in reduced CO2R selectivity and activity. Therefore, maintaining a low to moderate defect level on CNTs is critical. Guided by this understanding, we fine-tune the defect-level of CNTs through graphitization, achieving an unprecedently high selectivity for CO2 to CO conversion (CO to H2 molar ratio exceeding 16100:1, a remarkable suppression of hydrogen evolution by three orders of magnitude) and improved intrinsic-activity (turnover frequency of 1072 s−1 at −0.60 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) on an optimized Ni-Pc/CNTs composite. Furthermore, we achieved practical relevant CO production in a zero-gap electrolyzer (electrode size of 100 cm-2), reaching high current (up to 50 A), with high CO selectivity (> 95%) and reasonably low cell voltage (approximately 3.5 V), substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art silver catalyst. Moreover, we extend this knowledge to a Co-based molecular catalyst, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (over 50%) towards methanol production with a high partial current density over 150 mA cm−2. Overall, our findings underscore the significance of tuning defect levels on CNT substrates for achieving desired performance for immobilized molecular catalysts.

Background: Melanoma is one of the most deadly skin cancers in humanity, which imposes extensive costs on governments. Fortunately, the death rate has decreased despite the increasing incidence of melanoma. Various treatment methods, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and the like, are used to treat this disease. However, despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, melanoma remains one of the leading causes of death in the world. One of the new treatment methods is based on microRNAs, one of which is miRNA 206. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of MIR-206 on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 in the melanoma cell line (A-375). Methods: The present in vitro study was performed on melanoma cancer cells in RPMI640 culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 ° C and 5% CO2 . After counting and dividing the cells, the cells inside the plate were stimulated in over time with the MIR-206 protein. Incubation was performed. After 48 hours, the cells were collected, the total mRNA was extracted, and the expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The results demonstrated that the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 IL6 decreased in the melanoma cell line (A-375) in exposure to MIR-206. The results also showed the expression of nuclear factor kappa B in the melanoma cell line. Conclusion: The findings confirmed the role of MIR-206 as a tumor suppressor in melanoma cancer. These results suggest that MIR-206 may be a new treatment for melanoma in the near future. Accordingly, MIR-206 can be considered a potential target in the gene therapy of patients with melanoma cancer, and one of the advantages of MIR-206 gene therapy in melanoma cancer over chemotherapy is the reduction of cytotoxicity and its invasiveness.

This research, developed in the framework of the SCARABEUS project, studies the off-design performance of transcritical power cycles running on CO2-SO2 mixtures in Concentrated Solar Power applications. The objective of this work is to identify optimum operational strategies that maximise net energy production when exposed to variable ambient temperature, with special focus on the operation of the Heat Rejection Unit (Air-Cooled Condenser). The power cycle is simulated in Thermoflex, modified with user-defined scripts to account for the specific off-design performance characteristics of key components. The Air-Cooled Condenser is modelled by means of an in-house Matlab tool, already validated in previous publications, able to accurately simulate the heat transfer process between working fluid and cooling medium (air) and to calculate auxiliary power consumption. Four different strategies are identified, depending on ambient temperature: variable or constant condensation pressure for ambient temperatures lower than the design value, and constant turbine inlet temperature or constant return temperature of the heat transfer fluid for ambient temperature higher than design value. The results show that a combination of variable and constant minimum cycle pressure is the best alternative for low ambient temperatures, enabling net system efficiencies higher than 41%. On the other hand, constant turbine inlet temperature enables higher net performance than constant return temperature of the heat transfer fluid, even if at the expense of a reduction in energy storage capacity for the same inventory of molten salts.

In order to achieve a drastic reduction in CO2 emissions to limit global warming, it must be possible to globally cover the electricity demand from renewable sources. However, the fluctuating availability of solar and wind energy will nevertheless make it necessary to complement the renewables by thermal power plants. Additionally using e.g., the potentials of waste, biomass or waste heat from industrial processes locally in Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plants is a promising approach to finally achieve a stable and sustainable electricity supply. In the present work, therefore, different variants of a radial, velocity compounded re-entry cantilever turbine (Elektra turbine) are investigated regarding their potential for such applications. The paper concentrates on the fast prototyping of an existing 5 kW air turbine demonstrator, recently developed by the authors, by using the possibilities of additive manufacturing with plastic materials to substitute essential parts of the flow geometry. In this context the approach to implement the plastic parts in the turbine is explained. Experimentally determined efficiency parameters of various 3D-printed deflection channel modifications and a printed plastic wheel made of PA12GB are presented, discussed, and compared to the fully milled metal turbine. This results in a quantification of the additional losses due to the higher inaccuracies and roughness of the printed parts, which can be taken into account in further investigations. Furthermore, the various problems and hurdles that must be observed when using 3D-printed plastic parts in high-speed turbomachines are highlighted. With regard to the rotor wheel, the authors conclude that the use of additively manufactured plastic wheels is only feasible with increased preliminary testing. The time required for this is usually not in proportion to the manufacturing time and costs saved. For the stator parts however, 3D-printing turned out to be a reasonable approach.

This study investigates the synthesis of gold nanoparticles and surface modifications to enable their utilization as a colorimetric sensor strip on electrospun nanofibrous. Additionally, it utilizes cellulose acetate electrospun fiber preparations as substrates for loading the gold nanoparticles. In order to produce gold nanoparticles, citrate reduction was employed, followed by modification with maleic acid (MA-GNPs). MA-GNPs were significantly more selective for Pb2+ than for other ions (Co2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni+), according to the results. Following the introduction of Pb2+, the solutions exhibited a color change from red to blue or purple, which was attributed to the aggregation of nanoparticles, as determined by UV-Vis spectrometry. An optical band indicative of GNPs and MA-GNPs was detected at an estimated wavelength of 520 nm. Approximately 600 nanometers after the addition of Pb2+, the intensity of the solution progressively decreased to 520 nanometers, and a new band emerged. To fabricate cellulose acetate nanofibrous via electrospinning, the impact of solvent ratios, polymer concentrations, and process conditions were investigated. The ideal parameters for the fabrication of the substrate were as follows: 15%w/w polymer solution, 15 kV electrospinning voltage, 15 cm needle-to-collector distance, and 48 hours of collecting time. In order to examine the color change of the prepared strip, it is observed that the strip transforms from red to blue upon exposure to Pb2+ ions of varying concentrations, just as it does in solution form. An examination of water samples indicated that the strip remained colorless when tested with DI water. However, testing with wastewater sourced from a battery facility identified a transformation of the strip from red to purplish blue. This is equivalent to an estimated lead concentration of 40 parts per million. The outcomes showcased the capacity of the discolored strips to identify the preliminary concentration of lead ions, suggesting potential for future advancements in this area.

The purple nonsulfur bacteria, Rhodospirillum rubrum, is recognized as a potential strain for PHAs bioindustrial processes since they can assimilate a broad range of carbon sources, such as syngas, to allow reduction of the production costs. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the biomass and PHA formation behaviors of R. rubrum under 100% CO and 50% CO gas atmosphere and found that pure CO promoted the PHA synthesis (PHA content up to 23.3% of the CDW). Hydrogen addition facilitated the uptake and utilization rates of CO and elevated 3-HV monomers content (molar proportion of 3-HV up to 9.2% in the presence of 50% H2). To elucidate the genetic events culminating in the CO assimilation process, we performed whole transcriptome analysis of R. rubrum grown under 100% CO or 50% CO using RNA sequencing. Transcriptomic analysis indicated different CO2 assimilation strategy was triggered by the presence of H2, where the CBB played a minor role. An increase in BCAA biosynthesis related gene abundance was observed under 50% CO condition. Furthermore, we detected the α-ketoglutarate (αKG) synthase, converting fumarate to αKG linked to the αKG-derived amino acids synthesis, and series of threonine-dependent isoleucine synthesis enzymes were significantly induced. Collectively, our results suggested that those amino acid synthesis pathways represented a key way for carbon assimilation and redox potential maintenance by R. rubrum growth under syngas condition, which could partly replace the PHA production and affect its monomer composition in copolymers. Finally, a fed-batch fermentation of the R. rubrum in a 3-l bioreactor was carried out and proved H2 addition indeed increased the PHA accumulation rate, yielding 20% ww-1 PHA production within six days.

Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) and municipal solid wastes (MSWs) have been found to be viable sources of clean energy. This study integrates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for methane flow rate estimation in the software Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning-Integrated Benefit Calculator (LEAP-IBC) system to estimate and project the methane emissions coming from the waste generated by Metro Manila, disposed in sanitary landfills. It aims to analyze the environmental impacts of the emissions coming from the non-energy sector using the IBC feature of LEAP and by developing two scenarios with 2010 and 2050 as the base and end years: the baseline and methane recovery scenario, where the latter represents the solid waste management undertaken to counter the emissions. Under the baseline, 97.30 million metric tonnes of methane emissions are expected to be produced and are predicted to continuously increase. In the same scenario, the cities of Quezon, Manila, and Caloocan account for the biggest methane emissions. On the other hand, in the methane recovery scenario, the methane emissions are expected to have a decline of 36% from 127.036 to 81.303 million metric tonnes by 2025, 52% from 135.358 to 64.972 million metric tonnes by 2030, and 54% from 150.554 to 69.254 million metric tonnes by 2040. For the 40-year projection of the study under the 100-year global warming potential analysis, a total of 10,249 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent is avoided in the methane recovery compared to the BAU, and a maximum of 0.019 °C temperature increase can also be avoided. Moreover, electricity costs without LFG technology increase from 2.21 trillion to 8.75 trillion, while costs with LFG technology also rise but remain consistently lower, ranging from 2.20 trillion to 8.74 trillion. This consistent reduction in electricity costs underscores the long-term value and importance of adopting LFG technology, even as its relative savings impact diminishes over time. Finally, the fixed effects and random effects panel data regression analysis reinforces and asserts that the solid waste management is really improved by means of the methane recovery technology, leading the methane emissions to decrease.

(English) The rapid growth of Mexico’s urban population and the highly exposed vulnerability of the country to natural hazards and climate risk are aspects that need to be considered for the actual adaptation of the infrastructure to ensure the safety of all the residents. Last decade, private construction companies and the public administration in Mexico built different large-scale social housing projects for low-income occupants to provide a house to the most vulnerable population considering natural hazards and climate risk. The quality of the buildings is getting worse with time causing health problems, non-inclusive spaces, poor architectural flexibility, expensive maintenance, and poor environmental performance, among others. Having said that, the leading question of this study is: How to design a more sustainable and resilient incremental social house in Mexico City considering social, environmental, and economic aspects? The main limitation of this proposal is to respect the budget from the Mexican public administration designated to social housing projects. To deal with economic restrictions of Mexican public administration, the incremental housing concept proposed in this study could be used to answer (1) current housing needs for most low-income families in Mexico City, (2) provide an affordable initial core housing with spatial flexibility for future housing expansion, (3) provide a more environmentally sustainable social housing design in terms of the entire life cycle of the construction considering energy consumption and water consumption and CO2 emissions. Therefore, this research study presents a methodology, which is a combination of BIM (Building Information Modelling) and MIVES (Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessment), to assess the three main pillars of sustainability in incremental social housing design. To validate the methodology, first it is applied to three existing incremental housing cases, which are scenario A in Mexico, scenario B in Puerto Rico and scenario C in Indonesia, sharing similar characteristics such as construction area, construction cost per m2 and high-risk flooding location in developing economies. As well as, the same methodology is applied to elaborate a design elaborated by the author called MICASA, to find the best architectural solutions for an incremental social housing in Mexico City. The results show that the BIM-MIVES methodology is a useful tool for decision-making to improve the sustainability of social housing design in Mexico City. In this study, the proposal design, MICASA, shows 45% less CO2 emissions, 38% less energy consumption and 68% less solid waste than scenario A. MICASA is 2.5 times more expensive per m2 than scenario A, however, MICASA respects the cost limit assigned by the public administration for a low-income housing construction in Mexico City with a construction cost of 546.45 euros/m2. Considering social and environmental requirements, MICASA is the most sustainable case study compared to scenario A, B and C. The findings of this study suggest that it is feasible to design more sustainable social housing developments in Mexico City considering the environmental impact reduction, life-cycle cost and social acceptance respecting construction budget limitations. (Español) El rápido crecimiento de la población urbana de México y la vulnerabilidad altamente expuesta del país a los peligros naturales y el riesgo climático son aspectos que deben considerarse para la adaptación de la infraestructura y garantizar la seguridad y el bienestar de todos los residentes. La década pasada, empresas constructoras privadas y la administración pública en México construyeron diferentes proyectos de vivienda social de gran escala para ocupantes de bajos ingresos y en algunos consideraron en el diseño los peligros naturales de las diferentes zonas. La calidad de estas edificaciones va empeorando con el tiempo provocando problemas de salubridad, espacios no inclusivos, poca flexibilidad arquitectónica, mantenimiento constante debido a la precaria calidad de los materiales, un pobre desempeño ambiental, entre otros. Dicho esto, la pregunta principal de este estudio es: ¿Cómo diseñar una vivienda social incremental más sostenible y resiliente en la Ciudad de México considerando aspectos sociales, ambientales y económicos? La principal limitación de esta propuesta es respetar el presupuesto de la administración pública mexicana destinado a este tipo de desarrollos de vivienda. Para hacer frente a las restricciones económicas de la administración pública mexicana, la estrategia de vivienda incremental, es propuesta en este estudio. Esta estrategia podría usarse para: (1) responder a las necesidades actuales de vivienda para la mayoría de las familias de ingresos bajos en la Ciudad de México, (2) proporcionar una vivienda básica inicial asequible con flexibilidad espacial para la futura expansión, (3) proporcionar un diseño de vivienda social más sostenible ambientalmente en todo su ciclo de vida considerando el consumo de energía y agua, y las emisiones de CO2 . Dicho esto, esta investigación presenta una metodología, que en combinación de BIM (Building Information Modelling) y MIVES (Modelo Integrado de Valor para una Evaluación Sostenible), evalúa los tres pilares principales de la sostenibilidad en el diseño de vivienda social incremental. Para validar esta metodología, está se aplica a tres casos de vivienda incremental existentes, que son los casos de estudio A, B y C, y que comparten características similares como área de construcción, costo de construcción por m2 y localización en una zona de alto riesgo de inundación en economías en desarrollo, entre otras. Asimismo, esta metodología es aplicada a un diseño elaborado por el autor, para encontrar las mejores soluciones arquitectónicas para la vivienda social incremental en la Ciudad de México. Los resultados muestran que la nueva metodología propuesta de BIM-MIVES es útil para la toma de decisiones para mejorar la sustentabilidad del diseño de vivienda social en la Ciudad de México. En este estudio, el diseño de la propuesta (MICASA) muestra un 45% menos de emisiones de CO2 , un 38% menos de consumo de energía y un 68% menos de residuos sólidos que el escenario A. MICASA es 2,5 veces más caro por m2 que el escenario A, sin embargo, MICASA respeta el límite de costo asignado por la administración pública para la construcción de una vivienda de interés social en la Ciudad de México con un costo de construcción de 546,45 euros/m2 . Teniendo en cuenta los requisitos sociales y ambientales, MICASA es el estudio de caso más sostenible en comparación con los escenarios A, B y C. Finalmente, este estudio sugiere que es factible diseñar desarrollos de vivienda social más sostenibles en la Ciudad de México considerando la reducción del impacto ambiental, el costo del ciclo de vida y la aceptación social respetando las limitaciones del presupuesto de construcción.

[Clara Borén Altés](https://openalex.org/A5001105925), No host. None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.5821/dissertation-2117-412171.
    
(English) A significant proportion of global carbon dioxide emissions are attributed to ocean-sailing ships. These shipping emissions are predicted to double in less than 30 years. In this sense, it is mandatory to develop tools and methods for a proper assessment of the air contaminants emitted by vessels as the basis for developing efficient policies also enhancing best practices on board. From an academic point of view, the training of seafarers is the backbone of success in emissions abatement as their actions and knowledge have a direct impact on ships operation. From a theoretical point of view, the objective of this thesis is to analyse the effects on emissions abatement of the two operational techniques, i. e. weather ship routing and slow steaming, used in the shipping industry to reduce fuel consumption taking also into consideration future seafarers’ education on the mentioned techniques. Firstly, this thesis merges the estimation of shipping pollutants and their mitigation through weather routing optimisation; two lines of research widely analysed separately but seldom discussed together. An open software of weather ship routing is used to obtain the minimum cost (i.e. optimised route) in terms of sailing time, using high-resolution wave forecasting analysing several scenarios for a Ro-Pax vessel sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. The assessment of fuel consumption and ship emissions calculations have been inspired by a bottom-up methodology, in conjunction with the estimation of the power increase needed to overcome speed decrement due to waves. The ship routing optimisation reveals a reduction up to 30% of ship emissions during severe storms on longer routes. Nevertheless, all the cases studied show emissions mitigation when ship routing optimisation is used. The expected increase of extreme weather events, in terms of frequency, intensity and duration due to climate change, suggests a gradual gain of implementing weather ship routing optimisation in all types of routes, regardless of the distance. Secondly, this contribution also investigates the effect on fuel consumption and emissions when vessels are sailing below the design speed (i.e. slow steaming), as a strategy to minimize fuel consumption. The estimation of fuel consumption is commonly based on the cubic speed- power relation as a bottom-up approach. Nevertheless, the cubic relation could overestimate the impact of slow steaming on fuel consumption reduction and the emissions assessment. Container ships real fuel consumption data is compared with the results of assessing these parameters from a bottom-up approach. The exponential values obtained for the speed- power relation show an overrating over 20%. Moreover, this section shows the results of the additional emissions savings in the framework of ship-specific measures when weather ship routing and slow steaming are applied simultaneously. Based on the results obtained, the present thesis proposes a weather ship routing software developed at the Barcelona School of Nautical Studies (UPC-Tech) as a new teaching tool for distance and face-to-face education, which has the aim to assess some knowledge of several competences of the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) code on weather routing and emissions abatement. The results of a teaching trial carried out alternatively at sea (distance education) and onshore (face-to-face education) are compared in terms of competences acquisition in the Maritime Education and Training framework. Results indicate that, in the context of maritime training, there are no significant differences between students enrolled in a face-to-face or in a distance environment and results also demonstrate that the proposed software represents an innovative teaching tool that can be used by all Maritime Education and Traning Institutions. (Català) Una part important de les emissions mundials de diòxid de carboni s'atribueix als vaixells mercants i es preveu que les emissions del transport marítim es dupliquin en menys de 30 anys. En aquest sentit, és d’una importància cabdal desenvolupar eines i mètodes per a una avaluació correcta de contaminants atmosfèrics emesos pels vaixells per tal que sigui la base del desenvolupament de polítiques eficients i de l’ús de les millors pràctiques a bord. Des del punt de vista acadèmic, la formació i conscienciació de la gent de mar és l’eix vertebrador de l’èxit en la reducció d’emissions, ja que les seves accions i coneixements tenen un impacte directe en l’explotació dels vaixells. Des d’un punt de vista teòric, l’objectiu d’aquesta tesi és analitzar l’impacte en les emissions de l’aplicació de dues tècniques operatives, com són l’optimització meteorològica de rutes i la reducció de velocitat de navegació, utilitzades en la indústria naviliera per reduir les emissions, tenint en compte també la formació de la futura gent de mar sobre les esmentades tècniques. Conseqüentment, aquesta tesi contribueix a l’Objectiu de Desenvolupament Sostenible número 13 de les Nacions Unides d’Acció pel clima. D'una banda, la present contribució combina l'estimació dels contaminants del transport marítim i la seva mitigació mitjançant l'optimització rutes. S'utilitza un programari obert d’optimització de rutes de vaixells mitjançant la meteorologia que ha estat desenvolupat a la Facultat de Nàutica de Barcelona per obtenir el cost mínim (és a dir, una ruta optimitzada) en termes de temps de navegació, utilitzant previsions d'onatge d'alta resolució per a un vaixell Ro-Pax navegant pel Mar Mediterrani. L'optimització de rutes revela una reducció de fins a un 30% de les emissions dels vaixells durant les tempestes severes en les rutes més llargues. No obstant això, tots els casos estudiats mostren una mitigació d'emissions quan s'utilitza l'optimització de rutes. L'augment esperat d'esdeveniments meteorològics extrems, en termes de freqüència, intensitat i durada a causa del canvi climàtic, suggereix un guany gradual d'implementar l'optimització de rutes mitjançant la meteorologia en tot tipus de rutes, independentment de la distància. D'altra banda, aquesta contribució també investiga l'efecte sobre el consum de combustible i les emissions quan els vaixells naveguen per sota de la velocitat de disseny (és a dir, en condició de navegació lenta o ”slow steaming”, SS), com a estratègia per minimitzar el consum de combustible. L'estimació del consum de combustible es basa habitualment en la relació cúbica velocitat-potència. No obstant això, la relació cúbica podria sobreestimar l'impacte de l’”slow steaming” en la reducció del consum de combustible i l'avaluació d'emissions. Es comparen les dades de consum de combustible real de vaixells portacontenidors amb els resultats de l'avaluació d'aquests paràmetres des d'un enfocament ascendent mostrant una sobreestimació dels beneficis de l’SS superior al 20%. En funció dels resultats obtinguts, aquesta contribució proposa un programari d’optimització de rutes marítimes segons la meteorologia com a eina docent per a l'ensenyament a distància i presencial, que té com a objectiu avaluar alguns coneixements de diverses competències del codi Estàndards de Formació, Certificació i Vigilància de la gent de mar (STCW) sobre l’optimització de rutes i la reducció d'emissions. Es comparen els resultats d'un assaig docent realitzat alternativament al mar (educació a distància) i a terra (ensenyament presencial) pel que fa a l'adquisició de competències en el marc d'Educació i Formació Marítimes. Els resultats indiquen que, en el context de la formació marítima, no hi ha diferències significatives entre els estudiants matriculats en un entorn presencial o a distancia i també demostren que el software proposat és una eina didàctica innovadora que pot ser utilitzada per qualsevol Institució d'Educació Marítima Superior. (Español) Una parte importante de las emisiones globales de dióxido de carbono se atribuyen a buques mercantes y se prevé que las emisiones del transporte marítimo se dupliquen en menos de 30 años. En este sentido, es de vital importancia desarrollar herramientas y metodologías para una correcta evaluación de contaminantes atmosféricos emitidos por los buques para que sirva de base para el desarrollo de políticas eficientes y para el uso de buenas prácticas abordo. Desde el punto de vista académico, la formación y concienciación de la gente de mar es el eje vertebrador del éxito en la reducción de emisiones, puesto que sus acciones y conocimientos tienen un impacto directo en la explotación de los buques. Desde un punto de vista teórico, el objetivo de esta tesis es analizar el impacto sobre las emisiones de dos técnicas operativas, como son la optimización meteorológica de rutas y la reducción de la velocidad de navegación, utilizadas en la industria naviera para reducir emisiones, teniendo en cuenta también la formación de los futuros marinos sobre las citadas técnicas. En primer lugar, la presente contribución fusiona la estimación de los contaminantes del transporte marítimo y su mitigación a través de la optimización de las rutas según las condiciones meteo-oceanográficas encontradas. Para tal efecto, se utiliza un software de optimización de rutas de navegación de acceso abierto desarrollado en la Facultad de Náutica de Barcelona (UPC-Tech) para obtener el costo mínimo (es decir, la ruta optimizada) en términos de tiempo de navegación, utilizando pronósticos de oleaje de alta resolución para un buque Ro-Pax navegando en el Mar Mediterraneo. La optimización de las rutas estudiadas revela una reducción de hasta el 30% de las emisiones durante tormentas severas. Sin embargo, todos los casos estudiados muestran mitigación de emisiones cuando se utiliza la optimización de rutas. El esperado aumento de eventos climáticos extremos, en términos de frecuencia, intensidad y duración debido al cambio climático, sugiere una ganancia gradual en la implementación de la optimización de rutas de buques en todo tipo de rutas, independientemente de la distancia. En segundo lugar, esta contribución también investiga el efecto sobre el consumo de combustible y las emisiones cuando los buques navegan por debajo de la velocidad de diseño (i.e. slow steaming, SS), como estrategia para minimizar el consumo de combustible. La estimación del consumo de combustible se basa comúnmente en la relación cúbica velocidad-potencia. Sin embargo, la relación cúbica aplicada a cualquier velocidad de navegación podría sobrestimar el beneficio del slow steaming en la reducción del consumo de combustible y la evaluación de emisiones derivadas de dicho consumo. En esta contribución, se comparan los datos de consumo real de combustible de varios buques portacontenedores con los resultados de la evaluación teórica de estos parámetros desde un enfoque ascendente mostrando una sobrevaloración de los beneficios del SS superior al 20%. En base a los resultados obtenidos, esta contribución propone un software de optimización de rutas como herramienta didáctica para la educación a distancia y presencial, que tiene como objetivo evaluar parte del conocimiento de algunas competencias del código Estándares de Formación, Certificación y Vigilancia de la gente de mar (STCW) sobre optimización de rutas y mitigación de emisiones. Se comparan los resultados de la enseñanza realizada alternativamente a distancia (en la mar) y presencial (en tierra) en términos de adquisición de competencias en el marco de la Educación y Formación Marítimas. Los resultados indican que, en el contexto de la formación marítima, no existen diferencias significativas entre los alumnos matriculados en un entorno presencial o a distancia y también demuestran que el software propuesto es una herramienta de enseñanza innovadora que puede ser utilizada por cualquier Institución de Educación Marítima Superior.
