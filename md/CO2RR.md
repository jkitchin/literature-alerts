We report a bifunctional metal–organic layer (MOL) as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CO under visible light irradiation with a turnover number of 6990 in 24 h and a CO selectivity of 99%. The fully accessible and modifiable Hf12 secondary building units and the coordinating porphyrin linkers of the MOL allow for the integration of both Ru photosensitizers and catalytic Fe-porphyrin sites into one single platform. The close distance (∼11 Å) between the Ru photosensitizer and the catalytic center leads to enhanced electron transfer and promotes photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This strategy leads to an increase of the CO2-to-CO turnover number for the bifunctional MOL catalyst over a combination of a homogeneous Ru photosensitizer and an Fe-porphyrin complex. The mechanism of MOL-catalyzed CO2 photoreduction was also studied by photophysical and electrochemical experiments.

Abstract A large amount of concrete contaminated by 14CO2 will be discharged from decommissioning of aged nuclear power plants. Rubbing, which separates cements from concrete debris, would be one of manners which allows to reduce volume of the waste if most of the 14C presents in the cement inside the concrete. We confirmed that the 14CO2 adsorbs on the cements more than aggregates by a factor of approximately 2 orders. Rubbing was carried out to obtain the mass balance and decontamination factor using simulated concrete debris which was not contaminated by the 14CO2. The cements and fine aggregates were separated from the debris as fines by rubbing using a Los Angeles testing machine. Steel balls with different size and different amount were used to proceed rubbing more. In addition, production rates of the fines were investigated in the debris that the heat treatment was carried out or not. Residues in a mill of the Los Angeles testing machine were washed to remove deposits remained on the surface. We concluded that the volume reduction can be effectively achieved by rubbing the debris that applied the heat treatment using more steel balls with larger size. DF was not improved by washing the surface residues. However, washing can resolve the concerns regarding radiation protection due to scattering of fines contaminated with the 14CO2 in treatment of the residues after rubbing.

Abstract In order to develop a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction with high power efficiency, we prepared molecular crystals with two types of metal phthalocyanine. Charge transfer complexes with acceptor were selected as the molecular crystal system to reduce the electrical resistance. Various bimetallic phthalocyanine systems consisting of cobalt phthalocyanine and another metal phthalocyanine were obtained as highly conductive separated stacked charge transfer complexes with iodine as an acceptor. The obtained catalysts for CO2 reduction were evaluated using gas diffusion electrodes. The catalysts containing the bimetallic phthalocyanine system of cobalt and copper phthalocyanines showed higher CO2 reduction current and higher CO production, indicating that the CO2 reduction on cobalt phthalocyanine is enhanced by the H2 formation reaction on copper phthalocyanine.

Recently, atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) have been widely applied in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), achieving exciting activity and selectivity and revealing structure‐performance correlation. However, at present, the efficiency of CO2RR is still unsatisfactory and cannot meet the requirements of practical applications. One of the main reasons is the difficulty in CO2 activation due to the chemical inertness of CO2. Constructing symmetry‐breaking active sites is regarded as an effective strategy to promote CO2 activation by modulating electronic and geometric structure of CO2 molecule. In addition, in the subsequent CO2RR process, asymmetric charge distributed sites can break the charge balance in adjacent adsorbed C1 intermediates and suppress electrostatic repulsion between dipoles, benefiting for C‐C coupling to generate C2+ products. Although compared to single atoms, metal nanoparticles, and inorganic materials the research on the construction of asymmetric catalytic sites in metal NCs is in a newly‐developing stage, the precision, adjustability and diversity of metal NCs structure provide many possibilities to build asymmetric sites. This review summarizes several strategies of construction asymmetric charge distribution in metal NCs for boosting CO2RR, concludes the mechanism investigation paradigm of NCs‐based catalysts, and proposes the challenges and opportunities of NCs catalysis.

We present a methodology for modelling gas diffusion electrodes with Cu-based catalysts. The applicability of the Butler Volmer equation (B-Ve) based on Tafel analysis is limited to single electron transfer reactions which are not typical of CO2 reduction reactions on Cu catalysts. We developed a method that involves linking the nanoscale effects encapsulated in a detailed calibrated microkinetic model (MKM) on Cu(100) electrodes to a mass transport model (MTM) on a low surface area, flooded agglomerate electrode. The MKM carries richer kinetic information of most reaction pathways described in contemporary literature for Cu(100). Polynomial equations are used to bridge kinetic and transport models without the need for excessive complexity. Our results show that using regression modelling, the microkinetic information at the microscopic level of the catalyst can be successfully linked with the macroscopic electrode models. We observe how mass transport parameters such as CO2 concentration, pH, and applied voltage, interacts with microkinetic information of the catalyst, influencing the reaction pathways and current densities of key products methane, ethylene, ethanol, and hydrogen. Although the model explores the medium to high voltage regimes, the methodology can address the oversimplification of CO2 reduction (CO2RR) kinetics and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for observed multiple kinetic regimes if comprehensive microkinetic models are integrated. It also serves as a foundational work for further experimental endeavours for the development of comprehensive microkinetic models. The holistic approach carried out in this work allows for the optimization of both reaction rates and mass transport, paving the way for rational optimisation of electrode designs and their scaling towards commercialization.

Abstract The performance of electrocatalysts is shaped not solely by the inherent structures of active sites but also by factors like the charge accumulation on the electrode surface and the electric double-layer (EDL) structure formed at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. At present, accurately modeling the electrochemical reactions occurring at EDL is a great challenge, mainly because the dynamic chemical change cannot be adequately captured by the commonly used static configurations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations face difficulty sampling across both time and space scales. Here, utilizing Ni-N-C/G catalysis CO2 reduction to CO as a framework to examine, we explored the catalytic process affected by EDL and accumulated electron on electrode under operando conditions by integrating grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) calculations with classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The findings suggest that the negative charge accumulating on the cathode material plays a crucial role in facilitating the adsorption and activation of CO2. Additionally, incorporating two intermediates, *COO + OH- and *CO + OH-, can significantly enhance the accuracy of the free energy profile. Moreover, the EDL can not only enhance the adsorption of CO2 and promote the cleavage of the C-OH (in the *COOH intermediate) but also inhibit the desorption of CO to some extent. Compared to the promotional effect induced by cations coordinating with intermediates, the primary promoting factor lies in the electric field (EF around 85%) distributed around the intermediates. With the inclusion of the EDL correction, our calculations align well with experimental observations, showing that for the CO2 reduction to CO on the Ni-N-C site, as the applied potential becomes increasingly negative, the rate-determining step shifts from *COOH formation to CO desorption at -0.60 VRHE. Our work not only explains a long-standing puzzle for an important catalyst but also highlights the crucial roles of EDL effects, which provide guidance on investigating electrochemical reactions without compromising the complexity of the electrode environment.

Carbon nanotubes feature one‐dimensional nature of collective excitations, wherein strong confinement of surface plasmons severely hinders the liberation of hot electrons (HEs), posing grand challenges for their utilization in photochemistry. In this study, we prototypically achieved directed HEs flow and extraction in hybrid plasmonic CNN based on cup‐stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs), taking advantage of their privileged edge‐plane sites. The localized pz electronic states and accessible intersubband plasmon excitations in the near‐infrared (NIR) regime stands in striking contrast to the conventional concentric carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by combined photo‐induced force microscopy (PiFM) and transient photocurrent response. The hybrid comprising intimately integrated CSCNTs‐C3N4 effectively sustains interfacial electronic states and underlies the energy extraction out of plasmonic components. The CNN demonstrates almost near‐unity NIR light‐driven CO2 reduction to CO with a rate of 1.35 µmol g–1 h–1. This work sheds light on the exploitation of metal‐free carbon‐based plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalytic applications.

The protonation of CO is recognized as the rate-determining step in the generation of C1 products during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on Cu surfaces. Despite its importance, the detailed mechanism and the precise proton source for this elementary step remain elusive and are under intense debate. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been used to investigate such a mechanism. However, semi-local functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level face significant challenges in accurately describing adsorbate-metal interactions and surface stability. In this work, we employed the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), a method based on many-body perturbation theory, to overcome these limitations. We coupled the RPA framework with the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation to model solvation effects and incorporated a surface charging method to account for the influence of the electrochemical potential. Our study reveals that, in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, adsorbed water at the surface acts as the proton source for the reduction of *CO to *COH over a wide range of potentials via the Grotthuss mechanism. At highly negative potentials, solvent water becomes the primary proton donor, with multiple competing mechanisms observed. In contrast, DFT-GGA functionals not only significantly underestimate the reaction barriers for *COH formation but also consistently predict solvent water as the proton source across all the potentials of interest. Additionally, RPA offers distinct insights into H2O adsorption and highlights the significant range of reducing potential within which surface *OH can exist, which is crucial for accurate CO2RR modeling. These potential-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic data illustrate a pronounced divergence between the mechanistic insights offered by RPA and those derived from DFT-GGA functionals. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on proton transfer in CO2RR and establish a framework for future theoretical studies of electrochemical processes.

Abstract Efficient heterogeneous catalyst design primarily focuses on engineering the active sites or supports, often neglecting the impact of trace impurities on catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate that even trace amounts of sulfate (SO 4 2− ) residuals on Ru/TiO 2 can totally change the CO 2 reduction from methanation to reverse-water gas shift (RWGS) reaction under atmospheric pressure. We reveal that air annealing causes the trace amount of SO 4 2− to migrate from TiO 2 to Ru/TiO 2 interface, leading to the significant changes in product selectivity from CH 4 to CO. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations show that the sulfate at Ru/TiO 2 interface notably enhances the H transfer from Ru particles to the TiO 2 support, weakening the CO intermediate activation on Ru particles and inhibiting the further hydrogenation of CO to CH 4 . This discovery highlights the vital role of trace impurities in CO 2 hydrogenation reaction, and also provides broad implications for the design and development of more efficient and selective heterogeneous catalysts.

Africa's abundant natural resources and renewable energy potential offer long-term prosperity, but the continent is still challenged with several hurdles in exploiting these resources efficiently. This study examines the prospect for sustainable growth in Africa about the impacts of renewable energy, biocapacity, government policies, research and development (R&D), and population growth on CO2 emissions. By employing multiple advanced regression modeling techniques such as Dynamic Common Correlated Effects (DCCE), Common Correlated Effects Generalized (CCEG), and Bootstrap Quantile Regression (BSQR), the study analyzed the correlations between these variables using data from 19 African countries, spanning from 2000 to 2020. While the results showed renewable energy and bio-capacity to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in all countries, government policies and R&D expenditure show differentiated effects on CO2 emission across countries. Additionally, population growth was found to be a critical factor in exacerbating CO2 emissions in Africa. Observing the lack of connection between government policy and the taping of green potentials in Africa, the findings highlight the need for targeted government policies that can promote renewable energy infrastructure, protection of biocapacity through sustainable land use practices, and increased support of R&D on green technologies.    

    

## Heterogenization of a Sandwich [(PW9O34)2Co4(H2O)2]10− in PCN–222/PCN–222(M): Exploring the Electron Transfer for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction

In this study, we designed and prepared polyoxometalate@metal‐organic framework (POM@MOF) composite catalysts through the anchoring of a sandwich POM [(PW9O34)2Co4(H2O)2]10− (shortened as P2W18Co4) to the hexagonal channel of the PCN–222 (metal‐free) or PCN–222(M) (M=Fe, Co) frameworks. The composite materials were applied to the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 reaction (CO2RR) to analyse the effect of incorporating P2W18Co4 on catalytic activity. The P2W18Co4@PCN–222 composite exhibited enhanced activity across a wide potential range (–0.60~ –0.85 V vs. RHE) and an optimal FECO of 72% at –0.75 V vs. RHE, which was more than double that of PCN–222 (FECO= 33%). The current density surpassed that of the PCN–222 precursors by over sixteen times at the same potential. In contrast, the P2W18Co4@PCN–222(M) composite demonstrated decreased current density, minimal enhancement in CO2RR activity, and a competing HER behaviour. Density functional theory calculations were conducted on simplified models of P2W18Co4@H2–TCPP and P2W18Co4@M–TCPP to elucidate the divergent catalytic performances. The findings revealed that while both configurations exhibited the same rate‐limiting step (formation of the *COOH intermediate), a significantly reduced reaction barrier was only observed in the P2W18Co4@H2–TCPP setup, explaining its substantial activity improvement.

The direct utilization of carbon dioxide as an ideal one-carbon source in value-added chemical synthesis has garnered significant attention from the standpoint of global sustainability. In this regard, the photo/electrochemical reduction of CO2 into useful fuels and chemical feedstocks could offer a great promise for the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. However, challenges in product selectivity continue to limit the practical application of these systems. A robust and general method for the conversion of CO2 to the polarity-reversed carbon dioxide radical anion, a C1 synthon, is critical for the successful valorization of CO2 to selective carboxylation reactions. We demonstrate herein a hydride and hydrogen atom transfer synergy driven general catalytic platform involving CO2•– for highly selective anti-Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes via triple photoredox, hydride, and hydrogen atom transfer catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the synergistic operation of the triple catalytic cycle ensures a low-steady-state concentration of CO2•– in the reaction medium. This method using a renewable light energy source is mild, robust, selective, and capable of accommodating a wide range of activated and unactivated alkenes. The highly selective nature of the transformation has been revealed through the synthesis of hydrocarboxylic acids from the substrates bearing a hydrogen atom available for intramolecular 1,n-HAT process as well as diastereoselective synthesis. This technology represents a general strategy for the merger of in situ formate generation with a synergistic photoredox and HAA catalytic cycle to provide CO2•– for selective chemical transformations.

Selective CO2 hydrogenation faces significant technical challenges, although many efforts have been made in this regard. Herein, a Ni-doped In2O3 catalyst supported by g-C3N4 was prepared using the co-precipitation method, and its composition, morphology, specific surface area, and band gap were characterized using TEM, XPS, BET, XRD, CO2-TPD, H2-TPR, UV-Vis, etc. The catalytic hydrogenation reduction of CO2 to produce methanol was tested. Under low-photothermal conditions (1.0 MPa), the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol is stable, effective, and highly selective, with a spatiotemporal yield of 86.0 gMeOHh−1 kgcat−1, which is 30.9% higher than that of Ni-In2O3 without g-C3N4 loading under the same conditions.

Synergizing air pollution control and climate change mitigation has been of significant academic and policy concern. The synergy between air pollution and carbon emissions is one of the measures to understand the characteristics and process of the air pollution–carbon synergistic control, which will also provide valuable information for collaboratively achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (such as SDGs 11 and 13). This study establishes a systematic framework integrating emissions inventory and projection models, correlation mining and typology analysis methods to predictively evaluate the synergy and comprehensive coordination between air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Chinese cities by 2030, 2050, and 2060 under different policy scenarios for air pollution and CO2 emissions control. The results reveal the significant effects of synergistically implementing clean air and aggressive carbon-reducing policies on mitigating air pollution and CO2 emissions. Under the On-time Peak-Net Zero-Clean Air and Early Peak-Net Zero-Clean Air scenarios, the total reduction and synergy for air pollution and CO2 emissions will be more significant, particularly by 2050 and 2060. This study is the first to integrate scenario projection and synergy evaluation in air pollution and CO2 research, providing a novel supplement to the air pollution–climate change synergy methodology based on co-benefit estimation. The methods and findings will also contribute to measuring the achievement and analyzing the interaction of the SDGs.

Abstract This study highlights the significant potential of activated carbon-based materials in environmental remediation and energy production, particularly in converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) using transition metal-based catalysts. It emphasizes the role of porous AC in waste reduction and resource utilization, examining various applications of CO2 and evaluating environmental impacts. The research explores commercialization opportunities and specifically investigates CO2 methanation using activated carbon-based materials. Using bibliometric analyses of 4196 articles from the Web of Science database, the study identifies a growing research interest in porous activated carbon-related CO2 methanation from 2014 to 2024. The top three journals in this field are Environment Development and Sustainability, Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery, and Journal of Environment Science and Pollution. However, there is limited inter-institutional collaboration in this field, suggesting room for development towards commercializing sustainable CH4 production pathways. CH4 is highlighted as a crucial intermediate in industrial processes, and research directions are identified through co-occurring author keywords analysis. The study suggests the need for a comprehensive approach integrating activated carbon materials into carbon-neutral energy processes while addressing the potential adverse effects of activated carbon nanoparticles on biological and environmental factors. Ultimately, it clarifies the potential uses and commercialization prospects for porous AC materials, especially in conjunction with carbon capture and utilization technologies, promoting sustainable practices in energy production and environmental management.

This study provides an overview of the atmospheric drivers of climate change over Greece (Eastern Mediterranean), focusing on greenhouse gases (GHG: carbon dioxide, CO2; methane, CH4; etc.). CO2 in Greece is mostly produced by energy production, followed by transport, construction, and industry. Waste management is the largest anthropogenic source of methane, accounting for 47% of total CH4 emissions, surpassing emissions from the agricultural sector in 2017, while the energy sector accounts for the remaining 10.5%. In situ simultaneous observations of GHG concentrations in Greece conducted at three sites with different topologies (urban background; Athens, regional background; Finokalia and free troposphere; and Helmos) during the last 5 years (2019–2023) showed increasing trends of the order of 2.2 ppm·yr−1 and ~15 ppb·yr−1 for CO2 and CH4, respectively, in line with the global trends. These increasing trends were found from both ground-based and satellite-based remote-sensing observations. Finally, during the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, a 58% reduction in CO2 levels was observed in the urban background site of Athens after subtracting the regional background levels from Finokalia, while the respective reduction in CH4 was of only the order of 15%, highlighting differences in emission sources.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore carbon emission reduction of electric vehicles from the perspective of electricity consumption. Design/methodology/approach Electric vehicles (EVs) consume large amounts of electricity, thereby generating large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, so there is an urgent need to consider whether EVs have greater potential for reducing carbon emissions than other modes of transport. In this paper, the carbon emission reduction potential (CERP) coefficients of EVs are examined under three different scenarios from an interprovincial electricity trading perspective. Scenario analysis was used to quantify the CERP of EVs in 18 provinces in China. Findings The results show the following: (1) The higher the proportion of general-fuel vehicles in all transportation, the higher the CERP of EVs. (2) Interprovincial power trading affects the proportion of coal power consumed in a province, and the higher the proportion of clean power in the purchased power, the lower the proportion of coal power consumed in that province. (3) The proportion of coal power in the electricity consumption of a province is correlated negatively with the CERP of EVs in that province. Originality/value This paper quantifies the CERP of EVs compared with other modes of transport and gives provinces a more intuitive understanding of the CERP of EVs. Furthermore, we derive the carbon emission shift out of each province via the electricity trading paths among provinces, analyzing the impacts of the variability between different provinces on EV carbon emissions.

As the world's leading carbon emitter, China has a profound impact on global climate change. Based on data from 2000 to 2023, this paper constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system to evaluate the progress of China's "dual carbon" goal. Using entropy-weight TOPSIS method to determine the weight of each index, we found that the installed capacity of solar power generation and sales of new energy vehicles have the most significant impact on carbon emission. Since 2012, China's overall carbon emission score has continued to rise, highlighting the importance of emission reduction measures. In order to predict CO2 emission from 2024 to 2030, the GM(1,1) grey prediction model and BP neural network regression model are used in this paper. Although the relative error of the GM(1,1) model is only 1.769%, its single-variable prediction limits its persuasibility. Therefore, this paper adjusted the index system and built a BP neural network regression model, which successfully predicted the carbon dioxide emission from 2000 to 2030, with a model fitting degree of more than 0.9. The results show that the index evaluation system and prediction model can provide an effective assessment of China's carbon emission status and provide a scientific basis for the formulation of emission reduction policies.

With a primary focus of achieving carbon neutrality, the energy-intensive industrial sectors (EIIs) contribute to more than half of China’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. During the process of China’s rapid economic development, distorted energy prices gradually became the main obstacle to energy conservation and emission reductions in the EIIs. Therefore, this study focused on determining the mechanisms affecting the energy price distortions of carbon emission efficiency (CEE) in China’s EIIs. Based on a stochastic frontier analysis, the changing trend of CEE in China’s EIIs was evaluated. The channels impacting the energy price distortions of CEE were further analyzed by a mediating effect and moderated mediating effect model. The main contributions and findings include the following: energy price distortions have a significant negative impact on CEE by suppressing technological innovations and hindering the restructuring of energy consumption; governmental environmental regulatory policies mitigate their suppressing effect on technological innovations and reduce the preventing effect by improving the energy consumption structure. The results suggest that market-based price reforms and moderate environmental regulation by the government could help to improve CEE in China’s EIIs. These findings are of great significance for promoting the sustainable development of the energy-intensive industrial sectors and achieving carbon neutrality.

Abstract This paper presents a comprehensive review of building lifecycle carbon emissions (CEBL) and reduction approaches, analyzing over 300 recent publications and engaging in in-depth discussion of more than 100 key studies. The review systematically examines CO 2 emissions across all stages of a building's lifecycle, from material production and transportation to construction, operation, demolition, and material recycling. While existing research highlights the significance of operational energy efficiency, this review reveals critical research gaps in quantifying transportation emissions, accounting for on-site equipment emissions during construction, and addressing the unique characteristics of non-residential buildings. Furthermore, the paper underscores the urgent need for improved construction waste management practices, especially in developing countries where landfilling remains prevalent. For the building carbon reduction approaches, promising building carbon emission reduction approaches include leveraging carbon dioxide sinks, implementing integrated energy systems, integrating building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), and enacting effective policy interventions are separately discussed. By revealing data and theoretical limitations within current research, this review calls for more integrated and context-specific approaches to CEBL assessment, paving the way for a more sustainable built environment.

Global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions has become a worldwide environmental problem, posing a great threat to human survival. As the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, China has pledged to reach peak carbon emissions by no later than 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. It is found that a carbon tax is a powerful incentive to reduce carbon emissions and promote an energy revolution, but it may have negative socio-economic impacts. Therefore, based on China’s 2020 input–output table, this paper systematically investigates the impacts of a carbon tax on China’s economy, carbon emissions, and energy by applying a computable general equilibrium model to determine the ideal equilibrium between socio-economic and environmental objectives. Based on energy use characteristics, we subdivided the energy sector into five major sectors: coal, oil, natural gas, thermal power generation, and clean power. The results show that when the carbon emission reduction target is less than 15%, that is, when the equilibrium carbon tax price is less than 54 yuan/ton, the implementation of a carbon tax policy can significantly reduce carbon emission and fossil fuel energy consumption, while only slightly reducing economic growth rate, and can achieve the double dividend of environment and economy. Moreover, because the reduction of coal consumption has the greatest impact on reducing carbon emissions, the ad valorem tax rate on coal after the carbon tax is imposed is the highest because coal has the highest carbon emission coefficient among fossil fuels. In addition, as an emerging clean energy source, hydrogen energy is the ideal energy storage medium for achieving clean power generation in power systems. If hydrogen energy can be vigorously developed, it is expected to greatly accelerate the deep decarbonization of power, industry, transportation, construction, and other fields.

Abstract The feasibility of utilizing induction flow levitation technique for synthesizing catalysts aimed at facilitating methanol production was explored in this study. Two distinct types of catalysts were prepared on a silicon dioxide substrate through mechanochemical synthesis utilizing copper and zinc oxide nanopowders: Cu/SiO2 and Cu/ZnO/SiO2. Subsequently, comprehensive characterization of the resulting nanoparticles and catalytic systems was conducted employing a suite of physicochemical techniques. Additionally, the purity assessment of the resultant nanoparticles was accomplished utilizing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The investigation of catalytic activity was carried out within a continuous-flow reactor, wherein methanol emerged as the predominant reaction product. Over the course of the experiment, a reduction in operating pressure was achieved while upholding elevated methanol productivity and ensuring a notable carbon dioxide conversion rate. Experimental analyses conducted on the pilot plant demonstrated that the catalyst incorporating zinc oxide showcased superior efficiency, attributed to its heightened CO2 and H2 sorption capabilities, consistent with the results of thermoprogrammed desorption. As by-products of the reaction, carbon monoxide, ethanol, methyl formate, dimethyl ether, propanol, isobutyl, and isopropanol were detected.

As urban areas continue to emerge as significant contributors to global carbon emissions, the classification of urban street trees has gained increasing importance in carbon sequestration research. By precisely identifying and categorizing different tree species, the carbon absorption capabilities of urban vegetation can be evaluated more accurately. This understanding is essential for addressing the growing environmental challenges posed by carbon emissions, as urban trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and mitigating the effects of climate change. In this study, a Feature Distillation Based on Diffusion Model (FDBD) framework was proposed, utilizing state-of-the-art image classification technology to enhance the accuracy of urban tree species identification. The framework utilized knowledge distillation, a process where a smaller, more efficient “student” model is trained to mimic the performance of a larger, more complex “teacher” model, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining high accuracy. The model’s effectiveness has been validated through combination experiments with a selected backbone model, achieving promising results. This approach not only enhances the understanding of urban trees’ carbon sequestration potential but also provides crucial insights for policymakers. By facilitating precise tree classification, it empowers urban planners to implement more informed and targeted strategies for carbon reduction, ultimately promoting more sustainable urban environments.

Recently, lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li-NRR) in nonaqueous electrolytes has proven to be an environmentally sustainable and feasible route for ammonia electrosynthesis, revealing tremendous economic and social advantages over the industrial Haber-Bosch process which consumes enormous fossil fuels and generates massive carbon dioxide emissions, and direct electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) which suffers from sluggish kinetics and poor faradaic efficiencies. However, reaction mechanisms of Li-NRR and the role of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer in activating N2 remain unclear, impeding its further development. Here, using electronic structure theory, we propose a nitridation-coupled reduction mechanism and a nitrogen cycling reduction mechanism on lithium and lithium nitride surfaces, which are major components of SEI in experimental characterization. Our work reveals divergent pathways in Li- NRR from conventional direct electrocatalytic NRR, highlights the role of surface reconstruction in improving reactivity, and sheds light on enhancing efficiency of ammonia electrosynthesis.

Municipal solid waste is one of the most significant sources of gas emissions. In a context of renewable energy production and greenhouse gas emission reduction, we focus on the amount of biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in a controlled landfill environment. We present a mathematical model describing this process from a microbiological and biochemical point of view, including the dynamics of the methane and carbon dioxide produced. A qualitative analysis of the dynamic system shows the existence of an infinite number of non-hyperbolic equilibria inducing an attractor that has been identified. Through numerical tests, we explore how the non-connectivity of the attractor resulting from the choice of growth functions can entirely transform the performance of the process, and highlight critical initial stock values that influence the amount of biogas produced.

Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of carbonyl-containing compounds provides a sustainable approach to upgrading biomass-derived feedstocks with reduced energy requirements. However, PEC reduction has primarily focused on hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction reactions, limited by the availability of stable photocathode materials. In this study, we demonstrate the extended PEC performance of defect-engineered CuFe2O4 films, achieving over 18 hours of stable benzaldehyde reduction to benzyl alcohol. Modulating CuFe2O4 conductivity from n-type to p-type through controlled annealing conditions enhanced its hole concentration, achieving a cathodic photocurrent density of 1.5 mA/cm2 at 0.5 V vs. RHE. Using 1,4-benzoquinone as a redox mediator in a mixed acetonitrile/water electrolyte, the PEC system produced benzyl alcohol at a rate of 2.57 μmol/h with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.3% at 0.50 V vs. Ag/AgNO₃. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) revealed that oxygen-rich annealing conditions improved charge transport and surface catalytic activity, resulting in a threefold increase in benzyl alcohol production rate. This PEC approach lowered the required applied potential by ~1 V compared to traditional electrocatalysis methods, offering a more energy-efficient route for carbonyl reduction. These findings underscore the potential of CuFe₂O₄ as a viable photocathode material for sustainable organic transformations under mild reaction conditions.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technology is an emergent field with the potential for substantial CO2 emissions reduction, enabling low-carbon utilization of fossil fuels. It is widely regarded as a critical technology for combating global climate change and controlling greenhouse gas emissions. According to recent studies, China has identified CCUS as a key emissions reduction technology in climate change response and carbon neutrality objectives. Within this framework, supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) transport pipelines are an essential means for efficient and safe transportation of CO2. Corrosion protection of pipelines enhances the efficiency and safety of CCUS technology and supports broader implementation and application. This paper reviews the current research on corrosion protection for SC-CO2 transport pipelines, discusses effect factors, compares various corrosion protection strategies, and analyzes the challenges in corrosion protection of SC-CO2 transport pipelines. It concludes with a perspective on future research and development directions in this field. This paper is dedicated to providing new research strategies for pipeline corrosion protection in CCUS technology in the future, and providing technical support for pipeline corrosion protection in CCUS industrial applications.

Energy metabolism at the emergence of life has been the topic of intense theoretical and experimental study. Alkaline hydrothermal vents (AHVs) may have facilitated energy-transfer and carbon-fixation at life’s emergence, via a primordial chemiosmotic mechanism. Specifically, pH separation across vent walls could have been the forerunner to pH separation across microbial membranes, with electron-conductive inorganic barriers containing [Ni-]FeS minerals mimicking the active sites of metalloenzymes in potentially ancient biological reductive acetyl-CoA Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, reverse Krebs and other metabolic pathways. We previously demonstrated pH gradient dependent reduction of CO2 to formate by H2 in AHV interface conditions. Here, we address the same problem of CO2 reduction, however using a macroscale reactor that allowed us to use minerals synthesized via protocols analogous to the alkaline vent mount formation. This reactor also allowed us to probe more variables, and explore longer experimentation time-frames. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the effect of the different aspects of the gradientrich hydrothermal-vent interface on the observed CO2 electrochemical reduction- such as different minerals, temperature gradients, as well as the flow of electrons under passive vs. induced currents and potentials. Using experimental simulations and electrochemistry techniques, We detected two key steps of the WL pathway (CO2 to formic acid, and the formation acetic acid) as well as reactions in the reverse Krebs cycle (fumarate to succinate). Both Ni in the mineral, and temperature as a property, were shown to affect the formation of formate. Extremely small currents were enough to efficiently carry out CO2 reduction. This work develops benchmarks to electrochemically explore the model of protometabolisms in the vent-ocean interface and opens to future analyses on the catalytic or electrocatalytic properties of Fe-[Ni-]S minerals as precursors of metalloenzymes.

By passively dissipating thermal emission into the ultracold deep space, radiative cooling (RC) is an environment-friendly means for gaining cooling capacity, paving a bright future for global energy saving and carbon dioxide reduction. However, assessing the global RC capacity at the day-to-annual scale remains challenging as the RC capacity significantly depends on geographic and environmental conditions. To our knowledge, no analysis of global RC capacity has been reported. Herein, we show the distribution of RC capacity on Earth by establishing a precise assessment model for evaluating the performance of a radiative cooler. Our assessment is comprehensively validated against experimental data and extended to elucidate the capacity of representative broadband and selective cooler. We also categorize the global RC capacity into five representative regions based on the year-round cooling power. Our assessment can inform trade-offs between design and practical application for the RC systems, alongside promoting RC-based technologies to tackle worldwide energy and environment challenges.

Climate change poses a significant threat to the sustainable development of all countries. The transition to low-carbon energy sources is a crucial strategy for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. We investigate the mediating role of clean energy consumption (EC) and fossil energy supply (ES) on the promoting of carbon emission intensity per unit of GDP (CO2/GDP) reduction by green bonds (GBs). We develop a mediating model to analyze how GB influences CO2/GDP reduction through EC and ES, utilizing panel data from 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu province spanning the years 2007 to 2021. Additionally, we assess the model’s reliability through endogeneity and robustness tests. We find that GBs contribute to reducing CO2/GDP by facilitating the structural transition of energy supply and consumption. Furthermore, the development of GBs enhance the consumption of clean energy and plays a direct role in advancing the transition in structure of both energy supply and energy consumption. Notably, we observe heterogeneity in the effectiveness of GBs on CO2/GDP reduction across different regions. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to actively promote the development of GBs to achieve sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, both financial and energy policies should be tailored to align with the specific energy structures of various regions.

TThis works proposes modifications to the values of input parameters in widely accepted semi-analytical models of thermodynamic properties of hydrogen and its binary mixtures to improve their prediction accuracy. The modifications include characterization parameters for the Peng and Robinson Equation of State (PR-EoS), the Jossi-Stiel-Thodos (JST)/Lohrenz-Bray-Clark (LBC) viscosity correlation, and the Chung-Lee-Starling (CLS) thermal conductivity correlation, applicable to pure hydrogen and its binary mixtures containing methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The changes preserve the mathematical structure of the models and ensure their compatibility with existing commercial packages. We consider temperatures ranging from 90 K (triple point of methane) to 1000 K, and pressures ranging from atmospheric up to 100 MPa. The revised characterization parameters of hydrogen lead to a reduction in the Absolute Average Deviation (AAD) of the PR-EoS calculation for hydrogen density from 2.76% (with a maximum of 8.05%) down to 0.182% (with a maximum of 1.9%). For the JST/LBC viscosity correlation, the AAD decreases from 11.82% (with a maximum of 54.3%) to 4.08% (with a maximum of 13%). Regarding thermal conductivity, the adjustments for the CLS correlation results in the AAD decreasing from 36% (with a maximum of 44%) to 2.14\% (with a maximum of 12.1%). Binary interaction parameters for gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen and phase equilibria calculation are also proposed. Finally, we investigage optimal mixing rules parameters for viscosity and thermal conductivity of mixtures for more accurate predictions of mixtures? transport properties.

This paper aims to use photovoltaics as a case study of a green building in Jordan to provide electric power, boost the power provided by the national grid, and enhance energy policies to reduce CO2 emissions. The photovoltaic PV panels are used to provide nearly 7.4 kW of electricity power for the lighting. The study uses Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Screen (RETScreen) computer software to achieve this aim. Three different aspects were subjected to the analysis: Firstly, the proposed case power system; secondly, emission analysis; and finally, financial analysis. The worksheet of the analysis of emission reduction is used to estimate the emission of CO2 in the proposed project. The study findings reveal that the GHG emission factor in tCO2/MWh equals 0.924, while the net annual GHG emission reduction in tCO2 is 8,367.4, which is equivalent to the consumption of 19,459 barrels of crude oil.

Sediment dredging and aeration are used as important technical measures to remediate internal loading of sediment in polluted rivers. However, previous studies have overlooked the impact of dredging and aeration on Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission. We established three aeration rate(six different aeration intervals), one dredging treatment to investigate the effect of aeration and dredging on pollutant removals and CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions. The results indicated the pollutants and GHGs at 2.4, 3.4, 4.4 L min−1 aeration rates reached collaborative emission reduction after more than 3 h or within 1.5 h. Meanwhile, the GHGs fluxes after aeration decreased with the increasing aeration rate, with the mean CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes of 69.74, 0.16, 7.53 mg m−2 h−1 and 33.64, 0.09, 4.17 mg m−2 h−1 before and after aeration, respectively. With respect to dredging, the pollutants and N2O reached synergic effects between reduction of pollution and carbon emissions after 1 h dredging. Specifically, the CO2 and CH4 emissions after dredging was lower than those of before dredging, but the N2O emissions was higher than those of before dredging. In addition, our analysis revealed that the dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), available potassium (AK) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4+-N) in the sediment influenced GHGs fluxes at the water-air interface in the aeration. Our study indicated moderate aeration and dredging can achieve the synergistic effect in reducing pollution and carbon emissions.

This study presents a framework for predicting hemoglobin (Hb) levels utilizing Bayesian optimization-assisted machine learning models, incorporating both time-domain and frequency-domain features derived from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Hemoglobin, a crucial protein for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport in the blood, has levels that indicate various health conditions, including anemia and diseases affecting red blood cell production. Traditional methods for measuring Hb levels are invasive, posing potential risks and discomfort. To address this, a dataset comprising PPG signals, along with demographic data (gender and age), was analyzed to predict Hb levels accurately. Our models employ support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), classification and regression trees (CART), and ensembles of trees (EoT) optimized through Bayesian optimization algorithm. The results demonstrated that incorporating age and gender as features significantly improved model performance, highlighting their importance in Hb level prediction. Among the tested models, ANN provided the best results, involving normalized raw signals, feature selection, and reduction methods. The model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.508, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.228, and R-squared (R²) of 0.226. This study's findings contribute to the growing body of research on non-invasive hemoglobin prediction, offering a potential tool for healthcare professionals and patients for convenient and risk-free Hb level monitoring.

Abstract Background Diets largely contribute to the global disease burden, and a third of global warming emissions. We assessed the climate footprint reduction effect of framing the climate impact of diets as a collective action problem (social dilemma), compared or in combination with a reflective intervention (information) and a choice architecture intervention (nudge). Interactions with lifestyle factors were examined. Methods A randomised 2X2X2 between-subjects online experiment was conducted among university students ≥18 years, enrolled at a Swiss university, and not following a medically prescribed diet. The outcome was the mean climate footprint of food choices (in kg CO2-eq), based on a Life Cycle Assessment. Meals varied in climate footprints while adhering to the Swiss dietary guidelines. Results This analysis focused on the subset of meat eaters (n = 1691). Median age was 24 years, and 59.85% (n = 1012) were female. Seven intervention groups resulted in significantly lower climate footprints compared to the control. The social dilemma plus a nudge menu was the most effective behavioural intervention leading to 20.20% footprint reduction (b = -1.20 kg CO2-eq) compared to the control group (Mcontrol=5.94, SDcontrol=2.76; Mdilemma+nudge=4.74, SDdilemma+nudge=2.09 t(436) = -5.10, p &lt; 0.001). Lifestyle factors linked to a higher climate footprint of food choices included adhering to a low-calorie diet (b = 1.21 kg CO2-eq, p &lt; 0.05), or a muscle gain diet (b = 2.12 kg CO2-eq p &lt; 0.05) and practising physical activities (PA) while adhering to a muscle-gain diet (Aerobic/Cardio: 3.82 kg CO2-eq, p &lt; 0.05; Muscle-strengthening: 2.24 kg CO2-eq, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The combination of reflective collective action communication and menu nudges is an effective strategy to mitigate the climate footprint of food choices in education institutions. Adherence to a muscle-gain diet was identified as a critical but manageable lifestyle factor linked to a higher climate footprint. Key messages • The dilemma plus a nudge was the most effective to reduce the climate footprint of food choices. • This combined intervention can manage the high climate footprints linked to lifestyle factors.

Background: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that often results in atrophic scarring, impacting physical appearance and mental health. This study aims to evaluating the potential effect of combining punch elevation with fractional CO2 laser resurfacing versus laser treatment alone for moderate to severe atrophic acne scars. Patients and Methods: A split-face comparative study involved 20 adults aged 18 to 55 with moderate to severe atrophic acne scars. One side received punch elevation followed by fractional CO2 laser resurfacing, while the other side received fractional CO2 laser treatment alone. Clinical assessments included Goodman and Baron’s grading scale and patient satisfaction ratings. Histopathological evaluations analyzed fibroblast activity, epidermal thickness, and collagen composition. Results: The combined treatment significantly improved scar severity, with a mean reduction of 44.40% compared to 18.89% for the laser-only group (p < 0.001). Histopathological analysis showed increases in fibroblast activity (5.87% to 19.14%, p < 0.003) and epidermal thickness (635.65 µm to 1497.35 µm, p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was higher for the combined approach (6.80 ± 1.2) versus laser-only treatment (5.65 ± 1.3, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Combining punch elevation technique with fractional CO2 laser resurfacing enhances treatment outcomes for atrophic acne scars,,,

Abstract This article takes the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression cycle system as the research object, and analyzes different control methods such as speed control (including compressor speed regulation and turbine speed regulation), volume control (including changing compressor inlet pressure and compressor inlet temperature), and throttling control under established thermodynamic parameters. Based on the characteristics of the cycle and the characteristics of a single control method, a control strategy combining multiple control methods with different load intervals and mobility requirements is proposed. The research results indicate that speed control has the highest efficiency under partial load conditions among various methods, followed by volume control and throttling control. There are depth limits for load reduction in a single control method, and compressor surge and outlet pressure over pressure may occur in different load ranges. Based on the characteristics of different load intervals and regulation methods, we propose a combination control strategy scheme. When 0% FP ≤ load level &lt; 20% FP, a combined control scheme of throttling control and bypass control is adopted; When 20% FP ≤ load level &lt; 90% FP, the most efficient speed control scheme is adopted, which adopts speed gear adjustment to avoid frequent equipment actions. When 90% FP ≤ load level ≤ 100% FP, volume control is adopted.

Abstract The rapid advancement of digital technologies in China, America, India, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Indonesia, Germany, Iran, South Korea, and Russia presents both significant opportunities and challenges for achieving sustainable development, particularly in balancing economic growth with environmental conservation. This study rigorously assesses the impact of digital government initiatives on sustainable innovations and emission reduction policies from 2002 to 2022, focusing on their ability to balance ecological and economic influences. By employing a sophisticated model that integrates second‐generation tests to confirm cross‐sectional dependence and gradient variation, this research ensures the precision of its findings. The analysis reveals that digitalization, clean energy adoption, and the utilization of these countries' abundant natural resources over this two‐decade period have contributed substantially to reducing their ecological footprints. However, the study also identifies structural discontinuities in the linear trends and intercepts due to the integration of these technologies. By incorporating variables such as e‐commerce, income from natural resources, economic growth, conservation‐friendly technologies, sustainable energy sources, and carbon dioxide emissions, the model provides a comprehensive evaluation. The results highlight a consistent decline in ecological impact driven by technological and economic advancements. The policy implications are clear: to sustain and enhance these positive trends, governments must continue to promote digitalization and innovation while carefully managing the integration of new technologies to prevent potential disruptions.

Single-atom catalysts are promising for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion but face challenges in controllable syntheses. Herein, a facile selenic acid etching-assisted strategy has been developed to fabricate a hybrid metal-semimetal dual single-atom catalyst for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. This strategy enables the simultaneous generation of monodisperse active sites and hierarchical morphologies with hollow nanostructures. The as-obtained catalyst with Fe–Se dual single-atom sites supported by porous nitrogen-doped carbon (FeSe-NC) shows exceptional catalytic activity and CO selectivity, delivering a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of >97% with industrially comparable jCO, superior to the Fe single-atom catalyst. Moreover, the FeSe-NC-based rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery delivers a high power density (2.01 mW cm–2) and outstanding FECO (>90%), as well as excellent cycling stability. Experimental results together with theoretical calculations reveal that the etching-induced defects and the Se-modulated Fe centers with asymmetrical polarized charge distributions synergistically facilitate the key intermediate *CO desorption and thus accelerate the CO2-to-CO conversion.

The overuse of fossil fuels has resulted in massive CO2 emissions, causing global environmental problems. Renewable energy-driven electrocatalysis, which can convert CO2 into fuels and chemicals, is considered an emerging technology for carbon resource recycling. Cu-based catalysts sputtered on hydrophobic carbon paper and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane were comparatively investigated, while the effect of the thickness of the Cu sputtering layer on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance was investigated. Additionally, the effect of substrate properties on the distribution and morphology of sputtered Cu metal was investigated by SEM and XRD. With carbon paper as the substrate, the highest FEC2+ achieved was 70% at 200 mA/cm2, while the maximum value of FEC2+ on the Cu/PTFE electrode was realized with a Cu thickness of 400 nm (72%). Additionally, the PTFE substrate demonstrated a better inhibiting effect on HER, with a lower FEH2 and high FEC2+ over different applied current densities.

Abstract The rapid and uncontrolled urbanization of cities in developing countries has engendered a plethora of urban mobility issues, including traffic congestion, accidents, and air pollution. To address these challenges, contemporary urban mobility trends are incorporating innovative technologies and sustainable governance practices. This article investigates how urban managers can leverage the opportunities presented by cost‐effective technologies and the management of urban data to enhance urban mobility in developing countries. Within this discourse, an RSU‐based approach is proposed that employs motorbike taxis for inter‐vehicular communication, given their status as the most widely used form of public transportation. This approach substantially diminishes investment costs and reinforces the sustainability of urban mobility. Through the implementation of this solution, a noteworthy reduction is anticipated in the emission of gases such as CO2, and NOx, known contributors to climate change and various respiratory diseases. To validate the efficacy of the proposed solution, four distinct scenarios are scrutinized in a case study centered on the city of Douala in Cameroon, utilizing tools such as OMNET++, SUMO, Veins, and INET. The proposed framework offers significant benefits in terms of environmental sustainability and operational efficiency. It enables a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 15% reduction in NOx emissions, an 11% drop in fuel consumption, and a 15% reduction in waiting time in traffic jams. The envisaged solution aims to aid urban managers in their decision‐making processes, specifically in advancing sustainable urban mobility. Through the adoption of this approach, cities in developing countries can mitigate challenges associated with urban mobility and enhance the overall well‐being of their residents.

Reducing carbon emissions and controlling air pollution is a dual challenge for China in addressing climate change. Analyzing the synergistic relationship between PM2.5 and CO2 in urban green spaces has become an important part of promoting pollution control. The study investigated the influence and synergistic relationship between the spatial pattern of community parks on PM2.5 and CO2 in Xi’an City, Shaanxi Province, through practical measurement and ENVI-met/Open Studio simulation calculations. The results showed that: (1) Within the sphere of influence, community parks exhibit a positive synergy varying with distance, peaking at 400 m and declining as 300 m > 500 m > 200 m > 100 m. (2) The green space rate, total edge (TE), and mean patch shape index (SHAPE_MN) positively influence the synergistic mitigation of PM2.5 and CO2, with a defined maximum impact boundary. The strongest synergistic reduction of PM2.5 and CO2 occurs at a green space rate of 85%, TE1200, and SHAPE1.2, with optimal influence boundaries of 300 m, 200 m, and 100 m, respectively. This conclusion demonstrates the key role of green space in community parks in the synergistic abatement and provides a scientific basis and practical guidance for the planning and design of urban green space under the goal of “dual-carbon”.

Intermediate to high load operation in dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) techniques is restricted due to uncontrolled combustion that causes engine knocking. Dual fuel strategies with advanced pilot injection and near-top dead center (TDC) main injection timings are reported to enhance combustion control, albeit with increased soot emissions, reduction of thermal efficiency, and emergence of an intricate trade-off between total hydrocarbon (THC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) emissions. In order to address these conflicting issues, an intermediate engine load, corresponding to 6 bar gross indicated mean effective pressure at 1500 and 2200 rev/min engine speeds was investigated in this work. The main objectives of this work are (1) to obtain combination of control parameters to achieve near-zero engine-out NO x and soot emissions and high thermal efficiency while minimizing THC and CO emissions; (2) to understand the effectiveness of diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) for the oxidation and reduction of exhaust gas species in the dual fuel mode; and (3) to understand the oxidation characteristics of the soot generated from the dual fuel mode. Optimum dual fuel low temperature combustion strategies, in terms of diesel injection timings, quantity and exhaust gas recirculation levels, were identified using the statistical multi response signal to noise (MRSN) ratio method in which NO x , soot and indicated efficiency were response variables. The performance of commercial DOCs, with different precious metal (Pt and/or Pd) loadings, were also studied at optimum dual fuel strategies for gasoline-diesel dual fuel operations. High DOC outlet temperatures (>∼340°C), due to the exotherm generated by the oxidation of high concentrations of THC and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from dual fuel operations, resulted in greater than 90% THC conversion efficiency. The exotherm decreased the nitric oxide (NO) oxidation whereas the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) reduction reactions were favored over the DOC in the dual fuel mode at the intermediate load operating condition. Thermogravimetric analysis of the soot showed higher activation energy (177.2 kJ/mol), formed at the dual fuel optimum condition, relative to the activation energy (162.7 kJ/mol) of the soot formed in conventional diesel combustion (CDC).

This work aims to create a robust causal regression model that can accurately measure the influence of many variables on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in ASEAN nations from 1971 to 2017. The study aims to identify the main factors contributing to emissions and provide valuable information for implementing effective reduction methods. This is important because balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability in the fast- changing ASEAN area is crucial. The research used the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method to examine the individual contributions of various causes to changes in CO2 emissions over time. In addition, a model called ARIMAX (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables) is created to anticipate CO2 emissions and determine essential factors that influence them. The dependent variable is total GHG emissions measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent, while independent variables include GDP, energy intensity, carbon intensity, and population growth. The study discovered that GDP, with varied degrees of impact, is the primary catalyst for CO2 emissions in ASEAN nations. The energy intensity is projected to decline, indicating increases in efficiency, while the influence of population growth is forecast to be positive but less substantial compared to economic reasons. The research is anticipated to uncover disparities in the decrease of carbon intensity and the efficacy of policies across ASEAN nations, with more advanced economies demonstrating more resilient systems. These results provide significant knowledge for governments and companies, aiding in creating focused efforts to reduce emissions and improve carbon accounting standards across the ASEAN region.

Abstract Column tests were conducted to elucidate the pH neutralization and CO 2 fixation behavior of alkaline recycled soils permeated with CO 2 . The ventilation period required for complete CO 2 fixation ( t EOF ) was estimated from the test results of each column. The maximum amount of CO 2 captured per gram of dry soil (( m CO2 ) max ) was determined based on the inflow and outflow of CO 2 for each specimen. The investigation into the effects of soil density, specimen height, CO 2 gas concentration, and flow rate on t EOF and ( m CO2 ) max revealed that t EOF increased with higher dry density ( ρ d ) or specimen height ( H ), as a denser and larger specimen consumed more CO 2 gas. Conversely, t EOF decreased with a higher CO 2 gas concentration ( C ) or flow volume ( Q ) because a low C or Q resulted in an insufficient CO 2 gas supply to match the consumption induced by the reaction. Lower C and Q tended to yield higher ( m CO2 ) max , whereas higher ρ d and H resulted in higher ( m CO2 ) max . Furthermore, ( m CO2 ) max increased with t EOF , with a slight reduction in pH after neutralization with increased t EOF . This phenomenon was attributed to the longer ventilation period enabling more Ca to react with the CO 2 gas and maintain the equilibrium state of the reaction. Finally, the evaluation of the CO 2 consumption rate ( CSR ) for each column specimen revealed that a higher C and Q resulted in a lower CSR , whereas a higher H resulted in a higher CSR . Additionally, a longer t EOF was associated with a higher CSR , although some variation was observed.

Abstract Field A, the largest cluster in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), faced a significant challenge with a high overall artificial lift failure index, surpassing industry standards at 28% in 2020. The primary contributors to this index were beam pump (BP) wells. In response, a comprehensive workshop was conducted involving all stakeholders to address the issue of artificial lift failures. Field A's artificial lift fail-less strategy was formulated and implemented as a result of this workshop. A long stroke unit (LSU) was deployed in Field A as a result of the persistently high failure rates for conventional beam pump units (BP), which exceeded 32% in 2020. In an effort to mitigate these challenges, a series of successful trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of LSU, which led to the conversion of 70 conventional BP units to LSUs between 2020 and 2023. The results obtained from the deployment of LSU in Field A showcased significantly improved run life, indicated by a reduction in failure index. This increase in reliability contributed to the avoidance of subsurface deferments due to less failures and tripping, resulting in estimated additional production of 320 bbl/d. Additionally, LSUs reduced the number of well interventions, primarily due to fewer failures. It resulted in a substantial improvement in the life cycle of the wells, saving $2.94 million annually. As a result of the deployment of LSUs, power savings were also achieved. In comparison to conventional BP units, LSU demonstrated a remarkable 40% reduction in power consumption, resulting in a significant decrease in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 4575 tCO2e since LSUs deployment. This successful implementation not only addressed high failure rates but also enhanced system reliability, reduced corrective maintenance, lowered power consumption, and effectively reduced oil deferment. This abstract outlines these positive outcomes, the challenges faced during implementation, and strategies used to overcome them. Additionally, it presents a roadmap for deploying LSUs across Field ‘A, with plans for over 150 LSUs installation in the next five years. The study provides valuable insights for the oil and gas industry, showcasing the potential for wide adoption of LSUs to enhance performance in similar fields.    

    

## Utilizing Artificial Neural Network Ensembles for Ship Design Optimization to Reduce Added Wave Resistance and CO2 Emissions

Increased maritime cargo transportation has necessitated stricter management of emissions from ships. The primary source of this pollution is fuel combustion, which is influenced by factors such as a ship’s added wave resistance. Accurate estimation of this resistance during ship design is crucial for minimizing exhaust emissions. The challenge is that, at the preliminary parametric design stage, only limited geometric data about the ship is available, and the existing methods for estimating added wave resistance cannot be applied. This article presents the application of artificial neural network (ANN) ensembles for estimating added wave resistance based on dimensionless design parameters available at the preliminary design stage, such as the length-to-breadth ratio (L/B), breadth-to-draught ratio (B/T), length-to-draught ratio (L/T), block coefficient (CB), and the Froude number (Fn). Four different ANN ensembles are developed to predict this resistance using both complete sets of design characteristics (i.e., L/B, B/T, CB, and Fn) and incomplete sets, such as L/B, CB, and Fn; B/T, CB, and Fn; and L/T, CB, and Fn. This approach allows for the consideration of CO2 emissions at the parametric design stage when only limited ship dimensions are known. An example in this article demonstrates that minor modifications to typical container ship designs can significantly reduce added wave resistance, resulting in a daily reduction of up to 2.55 tons of CO2 emissions. This reduction is equivalent to the emissions produced by 778 cars per day, highlighting the environmental benefits of optimizing ship design.

Given the growing demand for efficient catalysts in sustainable energy applications, this study investigates the structural characterization and catalytic activity of CuAgAu trimetallic aerogels synthesized via a sol-gel method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a porous network structure with uniformly dispersed trimetallic nanoparticles averaging 5-10 nm in size, which indicates a successful synthesis and nanostructure formation. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a face-centered cubic structure, with distinct diffraction peaks observed at positions corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Cu, Ag, and Au, respectively. These structural features are critical for understanding the crystalline nature and stability of the aerogels. The catalytic activity of CuAgAu aerogels for CO2 reduction was evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry, which showed notable enhancements in current densities at various applied potentials relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode. These findings indicate the aerogels’ effectiveness as catalysts for CO2 conversion. Furthermore, Faradaic efficiency measurements revealed a high selectivity in the conversion of CO2 to CO, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency of 85%, which suggests that the aerogels’ capability to efficiently utilize electrons in producing CO, as a valuable precursor in renewable energy and chemical synthesis applications. The combination of structural integrity, catalytic performance, and high selectivity positions CuAgAu aerogels as promising approach for sustainable energy technologies.

To provide new insights into the integrated management of carbon and heat for sustainable urban development, this study systematically investigates the complex relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentrations and land surface temperature (LST). Utilizing OCO-2 and OCO-3 satellite observations, combined with meteorological conditions, air pollutants, and spatial characteristics, a high-resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) monthly CO2 column concentration (XCO2) dataset for China spanning 2015 to 2022 was generated using the Random Forest algorithm. The study focuses on urban agglomerations, conducting centroid migration and coupling analyses of XCO2 and LST to elucidate their spatiotemporal distribution patterns and evolution. Results reveal significant seasonal variations in XCO2, which has exhibited a gradual increase over the years. The spatiotemporal distributions of XCO2 and LST in urban agglomerations show a high degree of consistency, with centroids either converging or following similar movement trajectories. Additionally, the degree of coupling and coordination between XCO2 and LST has improved annually, indicating a closer interrelationship. These findings enhance our understanding of climate system dynamics and provide essential scientific evidence and decision-making support for addressing climate change. By clarifying the connection between atmospheric CO2 and LST, this study contributes to the development of more effective strategies for carbon reduction and urban heat island mitigation, thereby advancing cities towards greener, lower-carbon, and more sustainable development pathways.

Leading services companies and specialty software firms alike have launched various tools and digital suites to assist carbon capture and storage (CCS) project operators with everything from ideal siting of facilities and pipelines to the efficient operations and around-the-clock monitoring of those facilities. CCS holds the promise of big business if industry can efficiently and economically operate at scale the slate of planned facilities. Oil and gas companies have been making investments in the space with aims to become leaders in a segment—ironic since the petroleum business is also one of the emitters of CO2 into the atmosphere. Last month, supermajor ExxonMobil executed the largest offshore CO2 storage lease in the US with the Texas General Land Office. The 271,000-plus-acre site complements the onshore CO2 storage portfolio ExxonMobil is developing and further solidifies the US Gulf Coast as a CCS leader, according to the operator. In an October 2024 report, the US Department of Energy (DOE) issued a draft strategy for carbon management technologies through 2030, stating that carbon capture and direct air capture are “essential” to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The report says CCS projects will grow dramatically over the next decade and beyond, adding that 18 CCS facilities are operating now in the US. DOE’s near-term CCS strategy through 2030 incorporates focusing research, development, demonstration, and deployment funding on priority use cases; building out CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure where it likely will be needed most in the future; supporting the implementation of effective and evidence-driven policies and regulations related to carbon management at other federal agencies; engaging communities and workers to ensure projects deliver benefits and mitigate potential risks to public health and the environment; and supporting climate diplomacy efforts to accelerate the adoption of carbon management at scale globally in a way that aligns with the Paris Agreement. “DOE is funding a variety of technologies to assist in decarbonization in the industrial and power sectors,” the report explained. “These approaches include carbon management as well as electrification, fuel switching, materials substitution, efficiency, and other emissions-reductions measures. In parallel, DOE is working to envision and develop transformative emissions reductions approaches that will create new options in the long term.” The US government has been an active participant in making funding available for the advancement of CCS technologies. In 2024 alone, almost $3.5 billion was made available between two separate programs—CCS large-scale pilot projects ($937 million) and CCS demonstration projects ($2.5 billion)—as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In June 2023, ceremonial shovels were plunged into the dirt in Ector County, Texas, to mark the start of construction for the largest direct air capture facility in the world, designed to capture 500,000 metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year. Occidental subsidiary OnePointFive’s $1-billion Stratos project is located on a 65-acre site made up of a network of air contactors, pellet reactors, a centrifuge, and a calciner—all known components that operate in other industries.

Catalytic COx (CO and CO2) hydrogenation to valued chemicals is one of the promising approaches to address challenges in energy, environment, and climate change. H2O is an inevitable side product in these reactions, where its existence and effect are often ignored. In fact, H2O significantly influences the catalytic active centers, reaction mechanism, and catalytic performance, preventing us from a definitive and deep understanding on the structure-performance relationship of the authentic catalysts. It is necessary, although challenging, to clarify its effect and provide practical strategies to tune the concentration and distribution of H2O to optimize its influence. In this review, we focus on how H2O in COx hydrogenation induces the structural evolution of catalysts and assists in the catalytic processes, as well as efforts to understand the underlying mechanism. We summarize and discuss some representative tuning strategies for realizing the rapid removal or local enrichment of H2O around the catalysts, along with brief techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. These fundamental understandings and strategies are further extended to the reactions of CO and CO2 reduction under an external field (light, electricity, and plasma). We also present suggestions and prospects for deciphering and controlling the effect of H2O in practical applications.

Non-stationary systems are found throughout the world, from climate patterns under the influence of variation in carbon dioxide concentration to brain dynamics driven by ascending neuromodulation. Accordingly, there is a need for methods to analyze non-stationary processes, and yet, most time-series analysis methods that are used in practice on important problems across science and industry make the simplifying assumption of stationarity. One important problem in the analysis of non-stationary systems is the problem class that we refer to as parameter inference from a non-stationary unknown process (PINUP). Given an observed time series, this involves inferring the parameters that drive non-stationarity of the time series, without requiring knowledge or inference of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Here, we review and unify a diverse literature of algorithms for PINUP. We formulate the problem and categorize the various algorithmic contributions into those based on (1) dimension reduction, (2) statistical time-series features, (3) prediction error, (4) phase-space partitioning, (5) recurrence plots, and (6) Bayesian inference. This synthesis will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and will enable systematic comparisons of different methods. We also demonstrate that the most common systems that existing methods are tested on—notably, the non-stationary Lorenz process and logistic map—are surprisingly easy to perform well on using simple statistical features like windowed mean and variance, undermining the practice of using good performance on these systems as evidence of algorithmic performance. We then identify more challenging problems that many existing methods perform poorly on and which can be used to drive methodological advances in the field. Our results unify disjoint scientific contributions to analyzing the non-stationary systems and suggest new directions for progress on the PINUP problem and the broader study of non-stationary phenomena.

In Latin America, the energy crisis has worsened due to the dependence on energy services and fossil fuel imports from highly industrialized countries at prices established by the international market; this is particularly relevant to the construction industry, which presents a significant deficit in optimal energy consumption. Hence, some governments have established public policies to maximize the efficiency of these services and, at the same time, minimize the carbon footprint. In this research study, we reviewed the public policies, strategies, and incentives for energy efficiency (EE) implementation in the residential sector established by the Mexican government. A scoping review methodology was chosen and implemented in the following steps: 1. Research inquiry identification. 2. Determination of the relevant literature and studies. 3. The literature selection. 4. Data graphing. 5. Results collection, overview, and submission. In this systematic review, we identified five mandatory standards (NOM-008-ENER-2001, NOM-009-ENER-2014, NOM-018-ENER-2011, NOM-020-ENER-2011, and NOM-024-ENER-2012), six optional standards, four strategies (Green Mortgage, Integral Sustainable Improvement in Existing Housing, ECOCASA, and NAMA), and three kinds of incentives (green bonds, credit and interest rates (Green Mortgage, FIDE, and Ecocasa), and taxes (Income Tax Reduction)). As a result of the implementation of the above, as of December 2020, NAMA financed 5106 developers of 38 projects in 15 states; contributed to a reduction of 126,779 tons of CO2; and aided 19,913 people. From 2013 to December 2023, EcoCasa subsidized 71,440 households for a total of 224 projects in 25 states; contributed to a reduction of 2.6 million tons of CO2; aided 285,760 Mexicans; and issued EcoCasa certificates for 3,473,556 m2. The results of the EE indicators in residential buildings showed an increase in the housing unit number as well as an increase in household appliances, with those based on power consumption prevailing. The residential sector ranks third in power consumption in Mexico, consuming an estimated 790 pj, of which 76% corresponds to thermal energy and 24% to electric power. Among countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Mexico has achieved an Energy Transition Index of 62%.

This year’s primary selections for the Drilling and Completion Fluids Technology Focus reflect now-well-established industrywide emphases on machine learning (ML), automation, and the achievement of successful drilling of CO2 storage wells. Enhanced methods of modeling and monitoring allow time and cost savings while surpassing safety goals and furthering efforts to optimize CO2 storage. Paper OTC 35433 discusses a study centered on accurate gel-strength estimation. The authors leverage ML techniques, particularly the use of artificial neural networks, to develop predictive models for forecasting the gel strength of synthetic oil-based mud systems at both 10-second and 10-minute intervals, surpassing the precision and speed of techniques based on traditional rotational viscometers. In a similar vein, paper SPE 216322 seeks to bypass traditional manual methods of monitoring drilling fluids, its authors describing a novel online system that measures 10 key parameters continuously. They write that the system has been field-trialed across 200 wells with results that highlight the system’s reliability, with continuous operation for over 125 days. Finally, paper SPE 217711 involves evaluating the effects of an influx of CO2 into drilling fluids, a key task in the drilling of CO2 storage wells. Concentrating on oil-based drilling fluid, the presented study describes the development and integration of models for properties of drilling-fluid/CO2 mixtures into an existing software suite. Recommended-reading papers include an investigation of the use of microwave power in recovering oil from contaminated drill cuttings, reduction of the carbon footprint of drilling fluids, and sedimentation behavior of particles in fibrous sweep fluids. As always, the long-sighted ambition of such research, and the skill applied in its pursuit, reflects the commitment to excellence embodied by the authors of technical papers presented at SPE conferences.

International agreements and national policies on environmental sustainability are changing the outlook for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) globally. These changes are highlighted by both monetary and intellectual commitments by oil companies around the world. Saudi Aramco has pledged $1.5 billion toward sustainable technology. In practice, members of Aramco’s EXPEC Advanced Research Center have collaborated with King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals to develop sustainable surfactants for use in high-temperature, high-pressure, and high-salinity carbonate reservoirs. They used no or only green solvents to produce soluble, stable surfactants with the potential for biodegradability. In Colombia, Ecopetrol is committed to reducing CO2 emission by 25% by 2030. As part of its efforts, it has been optimizing polymer injection in Chichimene, a heavy-oil field. By estimating life cycle greenhouse-gas emissions and energy consumption, it was able to show that polymer injection and its associated carbon intensity reduction could prevent the emission of 3,200 tons CO2 equivalent. To comply with the UK’s North Sea Transition Deal, which mandates a 50% reduction in offshore oil and gas emissions by 2030, Ithaca Energy and Energy Research Norway is using life-cycle assessment to guide more efficient heavy-oil recovery. By using low-dose polymer injection, instead of alternatives such as thermal EOR, it was able to increase exergy while also reducing CO2 emissions by 35%. In these studies, we already see the effect of the energy transition as companies turn away from traditionally effective but environmentally burdensome EOR methods such as steam injection and new polymers that show equal, if not greater, effectiveness with a reduced environmental cost. As we move forward with further regulation and innovation, it will be interesting to see how emerging technological developments in polymers, nanofluids, and even artificial intelligence can help producers meet both the economic and environmental criteria to maintain profitable fields.

Deeply understanding how local microstrain environment around diatomic sites influences their electronic state and adsorption is crucial for improving electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) reaction; however, precise engineering of the atomic microstrain environment is challenging. Herein, we fabricate Ag-CdTMT electrocatalysts with AgN2S2–CdN2S2 diatomic sites by anchoring Ag to the nodes of CdTMT (TMT = 2,4,6-trimercaptotriazine anion) coordination polymers. The Ag-CdTMT catalysts achieve approximately 100% Faradaic efficiency for CO reduction with an industrial level current density (∼200 mA cm–2 in H-cell). The embedded Ag atoms induce the formation of Ag–Cd diatomic sites with local microstrain, stretching Cd–N/S bonds, and reinforcing electron localization at Cd sites. The microstrain engineering and adjacent Ag atoms synergistically reduced Cd 4d–C 2p antibonding orbital occupancy for intensifying *COOH adsorption as the rate-determining step. This study provides novel insights into customizing the electronic structure of diatomic sites through strain engineering.

Global warming is a pressing issue. NASA has predicted that 15 Southeast Asian islands will be submerged by 2100, as a result of a 0.77 cm increase in global sea levels from 2022 to 2023. Global temperatures were 1.48°C higher than pre-industrial levels in 2023. Indonesia must increase the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. By 2030, energy consumption will rise by 3% and power demand by 8.5%, with fossil fuels meeting two-thirds of demand and CO2 emissions rising 35%. This study evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of a 60 MW Indonesian Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) geothermal power plant using carbon credits. Indonesia’s geothermal potential is 40% of global resources, but high upfront costs, insufficient regulatory support, and technical obstacles limit development. Flexible and efficient ORC geothermal power generation provides steady baseload power for low to medium-temperature resources. This study applies RETScreen software for techno-economic analysis, sensitivity, and risk assessment to analyze project feasibility under multiple scenarios. Initial costs, operation and maintenance expenditures, energy generation, and GHG reductions are analyzed in detail. Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) were calculated for four scenarios: minimal incentives, increased carbon credit incentives, extended project lifespan with tax benefits, and optimized scenarios with high carbon credit prices. With a pre-tax equity IRR of 20.7% and an NPV of $97.52 million, the project is commercially viable at $2/ton CO2 in Indonesia. Raising the carbon credit price to $18/ton CO2 boosts IRR to 26.1% and NPV to $142.74 million. An equity payback period of 2.9 years and decreased LCOE is achieved by extending the project lifespan to 30 years and using a carbon credit price of $46/ton CO2. These data show how carbon price affects geothermal investment profitability. Optimizing geothermal exploration and adopting innovative technologies can cut expenses and speed up progress. Inspired by the Philippines and Kenya, government incentives, tax cuts, and faster approvals can make geothermal projects financially viable, helping Indonesia reach its 2060 zero carbon emissions objective.

Background Different usage scenarios and design guidelines were considered when planning a factory building and its ventilation system. Accordingly, it often makes sense to analyze the actual operating conditions again during subsequent operations in order to optimally adapt the air supply to the respective conditions in terms of demand-responsive ventilation. The aim is to ensure good indoor air quality and thermal comfort while significantly reducing energy consumption. Methods For this purpose, in addition to the sensors in the building management system, approximately 120 wireless sensors were installed in the occupied areas to measure the air temperature, operating temperature, humidity, and CO2. In this way the spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, humidity, and CO2 in the hall were visualized and evaluated to reduce the volume flows of the ventilation systems. The recorded data and findings were used to optimize ventilation systems by gaining a deeper understanding of indoor air flow. Results As part of the investigation, a considerable reduction in the air volume flows and thus the required energy consumption of the air handling units was achieved while maintaining the same thermal comfort. It was shown that the temperature field and indoor air quality were not negatively affected by the change in the air volume flow over a wide range. Conclusions This was made possible by the well-designed ventilation system, which achieves a low-pulse, slightly stratified indoor airflow, and a structural envelope with very good thermal insulation.

Abstract. Under the Paris Agreement, signatory nations aim to keep global warming well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and preferably below 1.5 °C. This implicitly requires achieving net-zero or net-negative greenhouse gas emissions to ensure long-term global temperature stabilisation or reduction. Despite this requirement, there have been few analyses of stabilised climates, and there is a lack of model experiments to address our need for understanding the implications of the Paris Agreement. Here, we describe a new set of experiments using the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator Earth system model (ACCESS-ESM-1.5) that enables the analysis of climate evolution under net-zero emissions, and we present initial results. Seven 1000-year-long simulations were run with global temperatures stabilising at levels in line with the Paris Agreement and at a range of higher global warming levels (GWLs). We provide an overview of the experimental design and use these simulations to demonstrate the consequences of delayed attainment of global net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. We show that there are substantial differences between transient and stabilising climate states and differences in stabilisation between GWLs. As the climate stabilises under net-zero emissions, we identify significant and robust changes in temperature and precipitation patterns including continued Southern Ocean warming and changes in regional precipitation trends. Changes under net-zero emissions differ greatly between regions, including contrasting trajectories of sea ice extent between the Arctic and Antarctic. We also examine the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and find evidence of reduced amplitude and frequency of ENSO events under climate stabilisation relative to projections under transient warming. An analysis at specific GWLs shows that significant regional changes continue for centuries after emission cessation and that these changes are stronger at higher GWLs. Our findings suggest substantial long-term climate changes are possible even under net-zero emission pathways. These simulations are available for use in the community and will hopefully motivate further experiments and analyses based on other Earth system models.

During the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) on copper catalysts, linear-bonded CO (*COL) is commonly regarded as the key intermediate for the CO-CO coupling step, which leads to the formation of multicarbon products. In this work, we unveil the significant role of bridge-bonded *CO (*COB) as an active species. By combining in situ Raman spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we show that adsorbed *OH domains displace *COL to *COB. The electroreduction of a 12CO+13CO2 cofeed demonstrates that *COB distinctly favors the production of acetate and 1-propanol, while *COL favors ethylene and ethanol formation. This work enhances our understanding of the mechanistic intricacies of eCO(2)RR and suggests new directions for designing operational conditions by modifying the competitive adsorption of surface species, thereby steering the reaction toward specific multicarbon products.

Abstract. Reductions in the extent and formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and the expansion of southern-sourced waters in the Atlantic Ocean were linked to enhanced marine carbon storage during glacial and stadial periods and are considered a key mechanism explaining late Pleistocene atmospheric CO2 variations on glacial-interglacial and millennial timescales. However, changes in the formation of deep waters in the Nordic Seas, an important source of NADW, and their influence on the geometry and intensity of Atlantic overturning remain poorly understood, especially beyond the last glacial maximum, leaving possible impacts on atmospheric CO2 changes elusive. Here, we present high-resolution Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi B/Ca-based bottom water [CO32-] reconstructions, alongside with complementary C. wuellerstorfi stable oxygen and carbon isotopes and abundance estimates of aragonitic pteropods in marine sediment core PS1243 from the deep Norwegian Sea to investigate past deep-water dynamics in the Nordic Seas and potential impacts on Atlantic overturning and carbon cycling. Our data suggest continuous formation of dense and well-ventilated (high-[CO32-]) deep waters throughout Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5 and 4, alongside a deepening of the aragonite compensation depth by at least 700 m during the MIS 5b-to-4 transition, consistent with sustained Nordic Seas convection. In addition, higher-than-Holocene bottom water [CO32-] during MIS 5e highlight the resilience of Nordic Seas overturning towards a warmer North Atlantic, decreased Arctic sea ice extent and meltwater supply from surrounding ice sheets. A compilation of bottom water [CO32-] records from the Atlantic Ocean indicates that dense waters from the Nordic Seas may have continuously expanded into the intermediate and/or deep (western) North Atlantic via supply of dense water overflows across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge, diminishing the capacity of the North Atlantic to store carbon during MIS 4 and stadial conditions of MIS 5. Our study emphasises differences in the sensitivity of North Atlantic and Nordic Seas overturning dynamics to climate boundary conditions of the last glacial cycle that have implications for the carbon storage capacity of the Atlantic Ocean and its role in atmospheric CO2 variations.

This study examines the correlation between environmental innovation (EI), energy efficiency (EE), institutional quality (IQ), and environmental sustainability (ES) in the Southeast Asian economy from 1980 to 2019. The analysis employs both symmetric and asymmetric frameworks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The preliminary evaluation employing SHT, CSDT, and PURT indicates that the research variables demonstrate heterogeneity properties, cross-sectional dependence, and stationarity following the first difference. Moreover, the cointegration test results confirm a sustained relationship between the variables being explained and the explanatory variables in the long term. Utilizing the CS-ARDL methodology for symmetric analysis, this study reveals a positive and statistically significant correlation between the explanatory variables and environmental sustainability. This proposition posits that promoting EI, EE, and IQ can contribute to attaining the overarching objective of environmental protection. The study investigates long-term and short-run asymmetric relationships utilizing the standard Wald test, presenting definitive evidence. The presence of asymmetric coefficients reveals that positive and negative shocks in EI, EE, and IQ negatively influence environmental sustainability indicators, specifically CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. This statement suggests that the implementation of environmentally-focused innovation, the integration of clean energy, and the establishment of effective governance have the potential to bolster environmental quality through the reduction of CO2 emissions and the enhancement of ecological conditions. Regarding directional causality, the feedback hypothesis explores the causal connection between EE, IQ, and ES. The study’s findings offer valuable insights for formulating policies that will effectively guide future development endeavors in the region. In conclusion, this research highlights the importance of fostering environmental innovation, promoting energy efficiency, and enhancing institutional quality as essential measures for achieving environmental sustainability in the Southeast Asian economy.

The electrification of heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HDCVs) is pivotal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution; however, this transition poses significant challenges for the existing electric grid, which is not designed to meet the high electricity demands of HDCVs. This can lead to a less effective reduction in freight transportation's carbon intensity despite significant electrification efforts. Deploying renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, alongside energy storage solutions, is essential to address these challenges. This paper examines the current grid limitations and explores the critical role of microgrid deployment, integrating solar and battery energy storage systems, in supporting the electrification of HDCVs. We propose an integrated framework that is designed to enhance regional grid capacity and decrease carbon intensity by identifying viable sites where a microgrid can be deployed and provide estimates for the deployment cost. Furthermore, using this framework, we quantify the maximal impact of microgrid deployment in reducing CO2 emissions when we optimize the use of the available power. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the region of the Port of Savannah, GA USA.

Abstract Electric Submersible Pump (ESP) is very popular artificial lift method to produce at high production rate. However, ESP power consumption is costly and mandate proper optimization to operate at the optimal condition. ESP energy optimization directly improve operational efficiency and reduces lifting cost and greenhouse gas emission. The ESP power optimization is challenging exercise and requires involvement from multiple organizations. The process has to go through excess of possible combinations of surface choke valve positions and pump speed until reaching an optimized setting. Optimization of ESP operations helps operators to meet production target while maximizing the efficiency of the pump operation. However, it cannot be achieved easily, especially where time and resources are scarce. An innovative approach capitalizing the digital-twin model and artificial intelligence technologies to optimize the ESP performance and adhering to the environmental challenges of reducing CO2 emission has been introduced to expedite the optimization process. The new approach automatically utilizes ESP real time data, ESP installation data along with the well model to determine the ESP's optimal WHP and ESP frequency. The modelling will be automatically updated based on real time data and provide predictions of recommended operation frequency and optimum wellhead pressure, which is translated to choke size, to operate the ESP at BEP (Best Efficiency Point) and to maximize production rate and minimize power consumption. The optimization process has been implemented in the field resulting in a significant power consumption saving and CO2 emission reduction. Further gains are also expected from ESP performance, resulting in longer ESP run life and reduce number of workover cost. This paper will share the ESP optimization journey using the advisory tool from obtaining the data, performing the calculations, providing the recommendations, and field implementation of these recommendations. The best practices and lessons learnt were captured as a reference for future ESP power optimization advisory tool enhancement.

Abstract Background Health systems have an environmental impact of around 4.6% of global emissions, contributing to aggravating the climate crisis. However, the health impact of the carbon emissions originated by health systems is not regularly assessed. We aim to estimate the health burden and associated costs of the carbon footprint of health systems across the European Union (EU). Methods We calculated DALYs and associated costs based on human health damage factors (DALYs/kg-CO2e) by considering four scenarios. Three scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways (S1 - high growth, S2 - baseline, and S3 - low growth) represented variations of global society, demographics, and economics until 2100. A fourth scenario (S4) considered the current EU’s 55% reduction goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The healthcare sector’s emissions per capita (in CO2-equivalent) in 2019 were extracted from the Lancet Countdown, and population data were retrieved from Eurostat for the same year. Results In the EU, 365,047 DALYs (95%CI: 194,692-535,403) are expected to be caused by health systems’ emissions at baseline (S2). In an S1 scenario, the burden would slightly decrease to 315,374 DALYs (95%CI: 170,355-462,393), whereas a S3 scenario would increase 486,730 DALYs (95%CI: 243,365-681,422). If EU’s carbon goals are met, the burden could be substantially reduced to 164,271 DALYs (95%CI: 87,611-240,931). The monetisation of DALYs can result in costs amounting to 25.6 billion euros. Conclusions CO2 emissions from health systems are expected to significantly impact human health. It is therefore of the utmost importance to ensure that EU climate policies for healthcare buildings are in line with the Paris Agreement. This will require the implementation of climate mitigation programmes within the health sector and a review of clinical practices at the local level. Key messages • The carbon footprint of health systems is estimated to significantly impact health, with high economic burden. • EU climate policies for healthcare buildings and procurement must be aligned with the Paris Agreement.

This paper investigates the effects of the partial replacement of natural hydraulic lime (NHL) with waste glass powder (GP) on the physical, mechanical, and microstructural properties of NHL mortars. In the experimental study, five mixtures containing up to 50% GP were prepared to evaluate its effect on the flow, carbonation, unit weight, water absorption, porosity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, capillary water absorption, compressive strength, and microstructure of NHL mortars. The experimental results suggest that the partial replacement of NHL with GP significantly affects the properties of NHL mortars. A reduction in compressive strength was observed with increasing GP content in mortars at both early and later stages. Nevertheless, the compressive strength difference between samples containing 50% GP and the reference was found to be relatively minor at 91 days, implying an enhanced pozzolanic reaction over time. The incorporation of GP improved the consistency and capillary water absorption of mortars, while the opposite was observed for ultrasonic pulse velocity, porosity, and water absorption. The microstructural analysis revealed distinct changes in the structure of samples incorporating GP. The partial substitution of hydraulic lime with GP could be beneficial in reducing the CO2 emissions of NHL mortars.

Comprehensive Summary Tuning electrolyte properties is a widely recognized strategy to enhance activity and selectivity in electrocatalysis, drawing increasing attention in this domain. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies, debates persist about how various electrolyte components influence electrocatalytic reactions. We offer a concise review focusing on current discussions, especially the contentious roles of cations. This article further examines how different factors affect the interfacial solvent structure, particularly the hydrogen‐bonding network, and delves into the microscopic kinetics of electron and proton‐coupled electron transfer. We also discuss the overarching influence of solvents from a kinetic modeling perspective, aiming to develop a robust correlation between electrolyte structure and reactivity. Lastly, we summarize ongoing research challenges and suggest potential directions for future studies on electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis. Key Scientists In 1956, Marcus theory was developed to describe the mechanism of outer‐sphere electron transfer (OS‐ET). In 1992, Nocera et al. directly measured proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) kinetics for the first time, and their subsequent research in 1995 investigated the effects of proton motion on electron transfer (ET) kinetics. In 1999 and 2000, Hammes‐schiffer et al. developed the multistate continuum theory for multiple charge reactions and deduced the rate expressions for nonadiabatic PCET reactions in solution, laying the theoretical foundation for the analysis of PCET kinetics in electrochemical processes. In 2006, Saveant et al. verified the concerted proton and electron transfer (CPET) mechanism in the oxidation of phenols coupled with intramolecular amine‐driven proton transfer (PT). Their subsequent work in 2008 reported the pH‐dependent pathways of electrochemical oxidation of phenols. Electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis have gained emphasis in recent years. In 2009, Markovic's pioneering work proposed non‐covalent interactions between hydrated alkaline cations and adsorbed OH species in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). In 2011, Markovic et al. significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline solution by improving water dissociation, which was assumed to dominate the sluggish HER kinetics in such media. In comparation, Yan et al. applied hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory in 2015 to explain the pH‐dependent HER/HOR activity. Cations play a significant role in regulating the selectivity and activity of carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR). In 2016 and 2017, Karen Chan et al. introduced the electric field generated by solvated cations to explain the cation effects on electrochemical CO2RR. Conversely, in 2021, Koper et al. suggested that short‐range electrostatic interactions between partially desolvated metal cations and CO 2 stabilized CO 2 and promoted CO 2 RR. Recent researches have combined the exploration of the electrical double layer (EDL) structure with theoretical analysis of PCET kinetics. In 2019, Huang et al. developed a microscopic Hamiltonian model to quantitatively understand the sluggish hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. In 2021, two meticulous studies from Shao‐Horn's group analyzed the effects of cations on reorganization energy and the impacts of hydrogen bonds between proton donors and acceptors on proton tunneling kinetics, respectively. Electrolyte effects on proton transport process were researched in recent years. In 2022, Hu et al. and Chen et al. proposed that the cation‐induced electric field distribution and pH‐dependent hydrogen bonding network connectivity played essential roles in proton transport, separately.

Strategies that can introduce catalytic auxiliary into electrocatalysts to boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are meaningful in exploring hybrid electrocatalytic systems. Here, a series of hybrid elelctrocatalysts (Cu NCs@MOF‐545‐M, M = Fe, Co and Ni) have been prepared by assembly Cu NCs with MOF‐545‐M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) and successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. In the obtained MOF‐545‐M (M = Fe, Co and Ni), the integration of Cu NCs with MOF‐545‐M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) can create a hybrid electrocatalytic system that enhances the charge transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF‐545‐Co achieves high FECO (100%), CO generation rate (10.9 mol m‐2 h‐1) and energy efficiency (69%), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF‐545‐Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FECO by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.

This study successfully developed a foam copper (CF)-based CoMnOx@Co3O4/CF composite catalyst, achieving efficient thermal catalytic oxidation of paraxylene through multifactor optimization of synthesis conditions. At a Co:Mn molar ratio of 2:1 and a calcination temperature of 450 °C, the catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, with a T90 temperature as low as 246 °C, significantly lower than that of catalysts synthesized under other conditions. Additionally, BET, XPS, Raman, EPR, and H2-TPR test results indicate that the catalyst possesses a high specific surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, a distribution of multivalent Co and Mn species, and a lower hydrogen reduction temperature, all of which contribute to the high catalytic activity of CoMnOx@Co3O4/CF. Furthermore, in situ DRIFTS confirmed that the oxidation of paraxylene on CoMnOx@Co3O4/CF follows the Mars–Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. The proposed reaction pathway begins with the oxidation of the methyl group on paraxylene, followed by the opening of the benzene ring and further oxidation to CO2 and H2O. The innovative structural design and excellent catalytic performance of this catalyst provide new insights and solutions for the industrial treatment of VOCs.

Keloids and hypertrophic scars pose significant challenges in clinical management due to their propensity for recurrence and their impact on patient’s quality of life. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of various treatment modalities for these scars, with an emphasis on clinical outcomes, symptom alleviation, and recurrence rates. A comprehensive literature search identified studies published between 2014 and 2024, encompassing randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Results indicate that advanced therapies, such as botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), exhibit superior outcomes compared to traditional treatments, including triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), particularly concerning scar appearance and safety profiles. Furthermore, combination therapies, such as intralesional cryotherapy and CO2 fractional laser with intense pulsed light (IPL), demonstrated promising results in enhancing scar reduction and patient satisfaction. This review underscores the necessity of personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patient requirements, taking into account factors such as scar characteristics and skin types. Future research should concentrate on optimizing treatment regimens to maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects, thereby ensuring long-term success in the management of keloids and hypertrophic scars.

Introduction: The ongoing process of global warming, driven by the escalating concentration of greenhouse gases generated by human activities, especially in urban areas, significantly impacts public health. Local authorities play an important role in health promotion and disease prevention, and some aim to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. There is a consistent action underway to reach this goal, hence the need for mapping and implementing effective strategies and regulations. Materials and Methods: This study includes the analysis of policy guidelines adopted by the city of Bologna, consulted in March and April 2024. Bologna is one of the 100 cities committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030, 20 years ahead of the EU target. To identify the strategies adopted to mitigate climate change, the following methodology was used: (i) the systematic mapping of sources and spatial planning documents; (ii) the extrapolation of goals, measures, and target indicators; and (iii) the development of an overall matrix. Results: The main findings of the study and their connection to public health pertain to the identification of key macro-areas contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, while reducing the impact of climate change on health: (1) built environment and renewable energy sources, (2) transport and mobility, (3) energy, (4) green areas and land use, and (5) citizen support. Within these five macro-areas, 14 goals have been identified, to which a total of 36 measures correspond, and, finally, a target indicator is determined, mainly with respect to the reduction of tons of CO2 equivalent per year. Conclusions: In order to protect public health, it is evident that buildings and urban activities should not produce carbon emissions throughout their lifecycle. This paper presents a method to evaluate municipal policies regarding dual-impact solutions that address both environmental protection through sustainability strategies and public health, in compliance with the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach.

The continued transition towards electric mobility will decrease energy tax revenues worldwide, which has substantial implications for government funds. At the same time, demand for transportation is ever increasing, which in turn increases congestion problems. Combining both challenges, this paper assesses the effectiveness of congestion pricing as a sustainable revenue stream to offset fuel tax loss in 2030 while simultaneously enhancing efficiency in the transport sector. A congestion-based toll that is road-and-time-variant is simulated for the greater Berlin area in Germany using the multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) software. Through the simulation results, this paper quantifies the impacts of the toll on the governmental revenue, traffic management, environment, social welfare, and the distribution effects. We find that the revenue from congestion tolls in a metropolitan area can compensate the reduction in passenger car fuel tax. Furthermore, a remarkable welfare surplus is observed. The toll also successfully incentivises transport users to adjust their travel behaviour, which reduces traffic delay time by 28%. CO2 emissions as a key metric for decarbonisation of the transport sector decrease by more than 5%. The analysis of the distribution effects suggests that a redistribution plan with a focus on the middle-low-income residents and the outer boroughs could help the policy gain more public acceptance.

This computational study advances a theoretical framework for practical, electrochemical fuel generation displaying exponential product yields and product formation rates as functions of time. Exponential reaction scaling is simulated through an autocatalytic cycle that emulates the process of DNA replication facilitated by the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, an initial buildup of formate into a two-carbon chain through CO2 carboxylation forms oxalate. A subsequent, two-electron reduction yields glyoxylate, with base-mediated hydrolysis driving C-C bond fission of glyoxylate into two molecules of formate. These products are then recycled back to serve as reactants. This recursive process chemistry displays 2^n stoichiometries with respect to formate growth in the limit of ideal reaction selectivity. Each step of the proposed fuel cycle shows direct analogy to the steps of DNA annealing, nucleotide polymerization and hybridized strand fission that are responsible for the exponential product yields observed in PCR-mediated DNA synthesis. As a consequence of this replication behavior, rapid rates of fuel production are accessible even when the individual rate constants for the cycle's constituent processes are slow. Significant focus is placed on practical routes for realizing each of the three steps comprising this model case of formate replication, particularly the challenge of formate carboxylation and the corresponding energy demands and power constraints of the overall process.

Brain damage due to ischemic stroke and accompanying obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) negatively affect the current and long-term results of treatment. The key pathophysiological factors of the negative impact of OSAS are the numerous episodes of systemic and cerebral hypoxemia, hypercapnia, inducing variability of glycemia, blood pressure, and heart rate. The objective: to analyze the dynamics of changes in ventilation, oxygenation, the variability of blood glucose, cerebral oximetry, and the level of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in the blood on the background of the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP therapy) in patients with ischemic stroke and concomitant OSAS. Materials and methods. Two groups of 30 persons each were formed from 60 patients with ischemic stroke and OSAS. Patients of the I group have received basic stroke treatment. For patients of the II group the basic scheme of therapy was supplemented with CPAP. To monitor the effectiveness of CPAP therapy we used “SomnoChek micro” (Weinmann, Germany), “Masimo Root” (Masimo, USA), the Guardian™ Connect System glucose monitoring system (Medtronic, Ireland), capnometry with the “Prizm 7S” monitor (Heaco Ltd., South Korea). Results. The leading indicator of the severity of OSAS – apnea/hypopnea index before the start of treatment in patients of the I group was 51.21±9.87/h and 51.38±9.93/h in patients of the II group, at the end of the 7th day of treatment – 46.73±9.65/h and 5.54±0.96/h, respectively, at the end of the 14th day – 39.95±9.92/h and 5.28±1.02/h, respectively. The initial average level of carbon dioxide in patients of the I and II groups was 42.30±4.12 mm Hg and 42.80±3.91 mm Hg, respectively, at the end of the 7th day – 41.07±2.92 mm Hg and 37.57±1.67 mm Hg, respectively, and on the 14th day – 38.87±2.41 mm Hg and 36.23±1.57 mm Hg, respectively. The initial average values of cerebral oximetry in patients of the I and II groups were 49.27±4.98% and 50.60±5.40%, respectively, after 3 days of treatment – 50.13±6.61% and 56.87±5 .39%, respectively, at the end of the 7th day – 57.03±7.01% and 67.64±3.02%, respectively. The initial median values of the NSE level in patients of the I and II groups were 31.17 [28.54–38.41] ng/ml and 32.65 [28.71–43.65] ng/ml, respectively, on the 7th day treatment – 26.44 [24.15–33.44] ng/ml and 19.47 [17.46–21.15] ng/ml, respectively, on the 14th day – 24.09 [22.36–28.48] ng/ml and 14.28 [12.49–16.22] ng/ml, respectively. The coefficient of variation of glucose was 17.1% [15.4–18.9] in patients of the I group and 16.2% [14.6–18.1] in the patients of the II group, on the 3rd day – 16.25 [ 14.5–17.8]% and 11.9 [9.5–13.5]%, respectively, on the 5th day – 16.0 [14.2–17.2]% and 7.95 [6.6–9.5]%, respectively, and on the 7th day of treatment – 15.3 [13.5–17.2]% and 8.5 [7.5–8.9]%, respectively. Conclusions. The use of CPAP therapy in patients with stroke and concomitant OSAS have provided positive dynamics, restoration of adequate ventilation and oxygenation, normalization of the cerebral oximetry index, reduction of NSE level and glucose variability.

Abstract Background Healthcare systems account for 4–5% of UK national greenhouse gas emissions with delivery of care a major component.1 Preventing events that use healthcare resources should contribute to a reduction in emissions, in addition to the primary humanitarian aim of improving patient outcomes. The Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) and the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patient with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) trials demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the frequency of hospitalizations for heart failure (hHF), urgent heart failure visits (UHFV) and cardiovascular (CV) death for patients with heart failure (HF).2,3 Purpose The study objective was to translate predicted differences in clinical events associated with dapagliflozin use in HF to a predicted carbon emission reduction from a UK perspective. Methods A previously published model4 based on pooled DAPA-HF and DELIVER event rates was used to predict hHF, UHFV and CV deaths in a cohort of 1,000 HF patients over a 3-year time horizon. Composite greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (as kg CO2 equivalent) were calculated from components sourced from the Sustainable Healthcare Coalition’s Care Pathway Calculator according to assumed clinical pathways and were applied to predicted incidence of hHF, UHFV and CV death events. Average length of stay was sourced from the National Heart Failure Audit.5 CV deaths occurring outside hospital were assumed to incur no additional carbon emission except that associated with cremation. Proportion of funerals by cremation and associated GHG emissions were sourced from literature.6,7 Future emissions were not discounted, representing the NHS’s aim to approach ‘net zero’. Results Over a 3-year time horizon, treatment with dapagliflozin was projected to prevent 74 hHF events, 9 UHFV events and 20 CV deaths per 1,000 patients treated versus placebo. Total estimated GHG emissions associated with hHF (233.2 kg CO2e), UHFV (177.4 kg CO2e), and CV death (251.4 kg CO2e) were 85,660 kg CO2e per 1,000 patients treated with dapagliflozin versus 109,618 kg CO2e per 1,000 patients treated with placebo. The projected total reduction associated with dapagliflozin treatment was 23,958 kg CO2e over 3 years, a 22% reduction versus placebo. Per population (~690,000 HF patients), total emissions prevented by dapagliflozin over 3 years were projected to be equivalent to driving 42 million miles in an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. Conclusion While the main aim of any therapeutic intervention is to save lives and improve patient outcomes, to capture the full spectrum of benefit to stakeholders the environmental consequences of new therapies should be considered in addition to their clinical and economic effects. Our analysis suggests treating patients with dapagliflozin may contribute to reducing the environmental burden of HF in addition to improving patient outcomes.

Individual road mobility comes with two major challenges: greenhouse gas emissions related to global warming and chemical pollution. For the pollution reduction in the spark ignition engine vehicle, the standard and reliable aftertreatment technology is the three-way catalytic converter (TWC). However, the TWC starts to convert once an optimal temperature, usually known as the light-off temperature, is reached. There are many methods to reduce the warm-up period of the TWC, among which is using a burner. The initial question underlying this study was to see if the use of a relatively straightforward extra-combustion device mounted upstream the TWC, without complex elements, was able to serve the purpose of reducing the light-off time. Consequently, an original burner was designed and investigated numerically via the CFD method and experimentally via measurements of the temperature evolution within a TWC, along with the emissions specific to the burner’s operation. The main findings of this study are: (1) the CFD-based examination is a good way to decide on how to achieve the so-called fit-for-purpose internal aerodynamics of the burner (i.e., to obtain a homogeneous mixture) and (2) to reach the light-off temperature, conventionally taken as 500 K, the burner was operated for 5.2 s, i.e., 3.6 g of gasoline injected, 2.7 g of CO2 and 1.351 g of CO, respectively, emitted. Moreover, this study identified measures for improving the burner’s design as well as an enhanced procedure for the burner’s operating control both aiming to produce a cleaner combustion during the TWC pre-heating.

A proton exchange membrane electrolyzer can effectively utilize the electricity generated by intermittent solar power. Different methods of generating electricity may have different efficiencies and hydrogen production rates. Two coupled systems, namely, PV/T- and CPV/T-coupling PEMEC, respectively, are presented and compared in this study. A maximum power point tracking algorithm for the photovoltaic system is employed, and simulations are conducted based on the solar irradiation intensity and ambient temperature of a specific location on a particular day. The simulation results indicate that the hydrogen production is relatively high between 11:00 and 16:00, with a peak between 12:00 and 13:00. The maximum hydrogen production rate is 99.11 g/s and 29.02 g/s for the CPV/T-PEM and PV/T-PEM systems. The maximum energy efficiency of hydrogen production in CPV/T-PEM and PV/T-PEM systems is 66.7% and 70.6%. Under conditions of high solar irradiation intensity and ambient temperature, the system demonstrates higher total efficiency and greater hydrogen production. The CPV/T-PEM system achieves a maximum hydrogen production rate of 2240.41 kg/d, with a standard coal saving rate of 15.5 tons/day and a CO2 reduction rate of 38.0 tons/day. Compared to the PV/T-PEM system, the CPV/T-PEM system exhibits a higher hydrogen production rate. These findings provide valuable insights into the engineering application of photovoltaic/thermal-coupled hydrogen production technology and contribute to the advancement of this field.

The paper presents experimental studies on the effect of co-combustion of aviation kerosene with hydrogen in the GTM400 turbojet engine on the change in the carbon footprint generated by the engine in relation to its standard operation without hydrogen in the fuel. This research is in line with current research and development trends carried out in the EU, linking them to the issues of the European Green Deal, the Fit for 55 directive and current environmental trends in aviation and energy. The main objective of the research was to check the effect of hydrogen co-combustion in a turbojet engine on the change of the carbon footprint, while a secondary objective was to verify the impact of higher exhaust gas temperatures generated by the new, high-calorific fuel on the secondary generation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), especially in the thermal mechanism, as an undesirable effect. The research shows that the co-combustion of hydrogen with aviation kerosene in a turbojet engine reduces the carbon footprint (reduction of CO2 maximum of 15% and CO emissions maximum of 24%), but also increases the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) maximum of 58%, including those generated in the thermal mechanism (significant increase in the temperature of exhaust gases), moreover, the increase in nitrogen oxide emissions is proportional to the amount of co-combusted hydrogen, which is directly related to the stoichiometry of the combustion process. The main conclusion of the research is that technologies for the combustion or co-combustion of hydrogen in turbojet engines require further research and development, mainly on the side of the use of excess exhaust gas temperature generated during combustion and methods of reducing secondary nitrogen oxides.

Abstract The health needs of the population are increasingly difficult to plan and predict. Technological progress, artificial intelligence, new medicines, but also ecological disasters, humanitarian crises, energy crisis and other challenges (as a Covid 19 pandemic) represent the image of our time. New design of hospitals should be able to respond to the challenges of the future: comprehensive provision of health services taking into account the patient’s needs, working conditions taking into account the hospital staff, energy efficiency and construction in accordance with high standards and reduction of CO2 emissions (green hospitals), to ensure alternative sources of electricity and water supply bearing in mind potential emergencies. The big challenge of long-term construction in which advanced technologies and new procedures cannot simply fit into a rigid building structure that is several decades old (example Serbia), so it is necessary to apply precise planning and efficient and high-quality construction in the next generation hospitals, taking into account current modern equipment and that which will appear in the future. Designing hospitals involves anticipating future healthcare challenges, technological advancements, demographic shifts, and changes in patient expectations. Hospitals emphasis on patient-centered design principles, creating environments that prioritize comfort, privacy, and dignity for patients and their families, accessibility and inclusivity, infection control and prevention, sustainability and resilience. Modern hospitals should create collaborative spaces for interdisciplinary teamwork and communication among healthcare providers, research and innovation units, but also community engagement and health promotion activities. Future hospital design requires strong multidisciplinary and cross-sectional cooperation, in which priority is given to architects dedicated to this field and their cooperation with public health and health management experts.

Abstract Lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) is one type of Gen-IV nuclear reactor with great development potential. The supercritical CO2 (sCO2) Brayton cycle power generation system has the advantages of compact equipment, high efficiency, and great flexibility. Its cycle characteristics are highly consistent with the application requirements of high efficiency, flexibility, and safety of LFR, and it is regarded as the ideal power cycle of LFR. As one of the difficulties of LFR-sCO2 cycle power system, the study on dynamic characteristics and the control strategies of the whole system is relatively scarce. This work takes a MW-scale LFR-sCO2 system as the research object. The dynamic model and the simulation program were established, and the dynamic characteristics of the system were studied. The results show that the increase in rotational speed can quickly raise the mass flow rate and net power, and the surge margin of the compressor also increases significantly, but the net efficiency decreases. The reduction in flow rate or temperature of lead-bismuth eutectic can effectively reduce the heat load of IHX and net power of the system, but the heat power change rate of the system is much faster with the change of mass flow rate. The variation trends of the key parameters with the mass flow rate and temperature of circulating cooling water are basically similar. The split ratio has a significant impact on the compressor surge margin (SMmc and SMrc). With a 5% increase in α, SMmc decreases from 59.89% to 55.87%, while SMrc increases from 46.61% to 56.23%. To avoid the occurrence of compressor surge, it is necessary to pay attention to the change of surge margin caused by the change of α during the variable load operation of the system.

Introduction: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a critical procedure in gastroenterology, typically performed under sedation with the administration of supplemental oxygen. Nasal High Flow (NHF) is a newer method of oxygen administration combined with sedation for oxygen delivery. This meta-analysis was designed to identify the effects of NHF during ERCP. Method: Three major online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were searched on July 30, 2024. The search was not limited by publication language and focused on randomized controlled trials that compared the use of NHF with usual care in patients undergoing ERCP. Results: A total of 198 studies were identified after searching the three databases. Finally, five studies, encompassing a total of 581 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed that using NHF was associated with a significantly lower incidence of hypoxemia than usual care. The odds ratio was 0.29 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.14–0.60, p < 0.001, I² = 21%). The NHF group showed a higher minimum SpO2 value during the procedure, with a 2.55% increase in the mean difference (95% CI: 0.96, 4.13, p = 0.002; I² = 57%). Compared to the usual care group, the NHF group demonstrated a reduction in CO2 partial pressure level at the end of the procedure, with a mean difference of 1.83 mmHg (95% CI: -3.25, -0.42, p = 0.01; I² = 0%). The duration of ERCP showed no statistically significant difference between the usual care group and the NHF group, with a mean difference of 0.7 minutes (95% CI: -0.14, 1.53, p = 0.1; I² = 0%). Conclusion: NHF effectively reduces the incidence of hypoxemia, supporting its consideration as the preferred method of oxygen delivery during ERCP, particularly for patients at higher risk of respiratory complications.

Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 µm in diameter, posing a growing environmental and health risk. Composting is an excellent way to add nutrient-rich humus to the soil to boost plant development, but it also pollutes agricultural soil with MPs. Previous research has shown that MPs can threaten plant development, production, and quality, hence they must be studied. This study examined how a mixture of three MP types—polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polypropylene (PP)—affected greenhouse tomato plant development. MP types were spiked at 1% w/w (MPs/soil) in tomato pots, whereas non-spiked growth medium was the control. Statistical analysis was conducted using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test (95% confidence) to compare treatments and controls. Soil spiked with MPs increased chlorophyll content (SPAD), transpiration rate, photosynthetic rate, and stomata conductance by 5.16%, 16.71%, 25.81%, and 20.75%, respectively, compared to the control but decreased sub-stomata CO2 concentration by 3.23%. However, MPs did not significantly affect tomato plant morpho-physiological features (p &gt; 0.05). Biochemical analysis of tomato fruits showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction effects of MPs on carotenoid, total flavonoid, and sugar but increased protein, ascorbate, and peroxidase activity. However, there was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in the effects of the combined MPs on total phenolic content. These data imply that whereas MPs did not influence tomato plant physiological and morphological properties, tomato fruit biochemistry was reduced. This raise concerns that an increase in MPs in soils may reduce antioxidant content and negatively affect human health contributing to a decrease in food security.    

    

## Polymer Flooding Reduces Emissions and Energy Consumption in the North Sea

_ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 218231, How Polymer Flooding Reduces CO2 Emissions and Energy Consumption at the Captain Field: An Exergy-Return-on-Exergy-Investment Case Study,” by Tormod Skauge, SPE, and Arne Skauge, SPE, Energy Research Norway, and Nancy Lugo, Ithaca Energy UK, et al. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ Insights into the energy efficiency and environmental performance of the extraction of heavy oil from the Captain field in the UK sector of the North Sea are gained using life-cycle assessment (LCA), which incorporates the concept of exergy-return-on-exergy-investment (ERoEI). The LCA allows for separation of the process into material and work streams, assessing the effect of each separately. In the complete paper, the authors compare waterflooding (WF) to polymer flooding (PF) as primary extraction strategies. Introduction The Captain field is approximately 145 km northeast of Aberdeen, Scotland. The reservoirs lie at shallow depths of approximately 900 m true vertical depth with correspondingly low temperatures of 31°C and low pressures of 87 bar. A primary challenge is the relatively viscous oil of 40–140 cp. The field was initially developed with long horizontal wells and downhole pumps. Viscous oil implies mobility challenges, however, and water injection could lead to unstable displacement, early water breakthrough, and possible coning issues. After a successful pilot PF at Captain during 2010–2017, a staged enhanced oil recovery (EOR) development approach was adopted in 2016 aiming to extend the pilot polymer-solution-injection scheme to the full field through a phased development. Following the pilot study, the Captain EOR project was split into Stage 1 and Stage 2. The first stage involved drilling of five producers and two EOR injectors by 2022. The second stage included some brownfield modifications across the three Captain installations (two installations and a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel) and a significant expansion in the subsea area. The complete paper concentrates on the expansion in the subsea areas, Areas B and C. The methodology of the study, including the development of simulation cases, LCA, exergy analysis, system boundaries, material and work streams, and CO2 emissions, is detailed in the complete paper. Production Profiles The Stage 2 EOR development evaluates PF for Areas B and C. The baseline is WF with fully produced water reinjection. WF was scheduled to begin in January 2024 and to end in December 2099. The PF case also was slated to begin in January 2024 and to end in 2035 and 2034 for Area B and Area C, respectively. The field is operated on pressure maintenance, and the voidage replacement ratio is kept close to 1.0. This means that the PF injects more liquid than the WF case during the first 5 years of injection when the oil production is higher for PF. After polymer injection ends, the PF case injects less liquid than the WF case. In Area B, water cut is high from the start for the WF case. Because of the high mobility of the water, it fingers through the oil. In contrast, when polymer is injected, the water cut falls to approximately 80% and does not reach the starting value of 94.1% before 7 years, more than 2.5 years after having stopped the polymer injection in this area. The low water cut is the result of production of a large oil bank generated by the improved sweep and mobility reduction of the injected polymer.

Abstract Optimizing extensive ESP fields is a mandatory task in terms of carbon footprint and efficiency. The main goal is to keep the equipment running with the best efficiency as long as possible, acknowledging the ESP will show normal wear due to the operation. This analysis focuses on enhancing energy efficiency, allowing the definition of the true production capabilities by comparing operating conditions related to the motor technologies available for generating the best opportunities of improvement. By observing the well production response to increased injection in a seemingly optimized condition, it was proceeded to replace the ESP, incorporating PMM technology and a downhole sensor. This enabled us to: Define the actual IPR curve Simulate the condition on the extracted equipment (IM without a downhole sensor) Validate the deviation in ESP system efficiency Verify ESP wear through bench testing This approach allows for a comparison of extraction efficiency and the impact of wear associated with extended equipment run life. Based on the study findings, it is inferred that in ESPs with extended run life (&gt;2000 days), wear leads to a decline in energy and production efficiency, reducing efficiency by up to 18.6%. These results prompt preventive measures to optimize wells, boosting production without significantly altering energy consumption. This is achievable by transitioning to PMM-equipped systems, significantly enhancing overall efficiency. With these results, preventive actions can be taken to adapt the wells and obtain an increase in production without considerably modifying energy consumption. This is possible through changing technology, installing PMM equipment and significantly improving the efficiency of the system. In addition, it allows capturing production that was not considered, establishing the correct extractive status of the well. Additionally, the impact on energy efficiency contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions and improvement in specific consumption (KW/m3/d). Ultimately, assessing a well's extractive condition considering wear, reduced lifting capacity, and increased power consumption of an ESP is crucial. This approach facilitates well adaptation planning, minimizing downtime impact, enhancing system efficiency, and capturing additional oil in genuinely underexploited wells, thus preventing equipment failure This analysis provides an opportunity to accurately measure production status and true well potential. Enhancing extraction in these cases can significantly boost oil production (69% of increase in total fluid and about 150% in terms of net oil). The comparison performed considers post injection changes versus adequation of the system installing motors with PMM technology also around 17% savings in terms of energy are reached.

Обзор посвящен глобальной экологической проблеме современности - снижению парниковых газов в атмосфере. Значительная его доля депонируется в почвах. Обсуждаются меры, способствующие секвестрации углерода при землепользовании, поскольку почвы и леса, наряду с мировым океаном, являются основными хранителями СО2. Внимание уделено типам землепользования (целина, пашня, пастбищные, лесные земли). Приведен материал по обработкам земель: нулевой, стандартный с оставлением растительных остатков и без них; с применением биоугля, микроводорослей. Рассмотрен сравнительный анализ с использованием биомаркеров на пастбище со смешанным травостоем, пашне с рапсом, в почве под ивой с целью определения микроорганизмов, ассимилирующих углерод ризоотложений различных растений. Встречаются работы, доказывающие важность гидролизуемых липидов в лесах, составляющих, в отличие от фенола лигнинов, высокую долю в накоплении почвенного органического углерода (SOC). Они возрастают с уменьшением pH почвы, увеличением реактивного железа и алюминия и увеличением окисления лигнина. SOC выше в илистых и глинистых фракциях, чем в песчаных, защищая SOC в их агрегатах. Отсюда для определения стабилизации его в большинстве почв предлагается использовать в качестве ключевого элемента мелкодисперсную минеральную фракцию. Карбонаты играют важную роль в секвестрации углерода, на его долю приходится примерно 40 % углерода, хранящегося в почвах мира. Они являются основным компонентом накопления углерода в засушливых регионах. Внимание обращено к коренному улучшению пастбищ, инверсионной обработке (FIT). Приведен материал методического характера, где используются дистанционные методы (ДЗ), обнаруживающие SOC. В качестве прогноза используются предикторы ДЗ - как ближний инфракрасный, так и коротковолновый инфракрасный диапазон, с дополнительными фенологическими наблюдениями. Использование отраженной коротковолновой радиации в верхней атмосфере, большой потенциал смягчения климата оказали большое влияние на культивирование покровной культуры с высоким альбедо и недостатком хлорофилла. The review is devoted to the current environmental problem - a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. A significant proportion of carbon is known to be deposited in the soil cover. Measures are being discussed in a many countries to promote carbon sequestration depending on the land use, because soils and forests, along with the world’s oceans, are the main stores of CO2. Different land use issues (virgin lands, arable land, pasture and forest lands) are covered in connection with the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Data on the land cultivation: zero; standard with and without plant residues; using biochar; microalgae are given. A comparative analysis using biomarkers on a pasture with mixed herbage, arable land with rapeseed, soil under willow have been considered in order to determine microorganisms assimilating carbon from rhizosphere deposits of various plants. Some sources evident the hydrolysable lipids constitute a high share of the soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation in forests, in contrast to phenols of lignin. The former substances are actively accumulated with the decreasing of soil pH, increasing of reactive iron, aluminum, and lignin oxidation. SOC is higher in a silt and clay fractions as compared to the sandy ones due to it absorbance in aggregates. Hence, it was proposed to use the finely dispersed mineral fraction as a key element to determine carbon stabilization in most soils. Carbonates play an important role in carbon sequestration, accounting for approximately 40 % of carbon stored in the world soils. They are the main component of carbon storage in arid regions. Attention to the radical improvement of pastures is given - inversion treatment (FIT). The methodical issues to detect SOC by remote distance (RD) technique are given. Reflected shortwave radiation in the upper atmosphere (TOA) practice has shown a great potential for climate mitigation through the cultivation of a cover crop with high albedo and a lack of chlorophyll.
