Abstract CO2 capture and concentration (CCC) is critical to carbon negative technologies and can reduce or eliminate carbon emission of current industrial processes. A popular method for electrochemically-driven CCC uses redox carriers that bind and release CO2 depending on their oxidation state. Two critical properties of redox carriers are the reduction potential required to ‘activate’ the redox carrier for CO2 capture and the CO2 binding constant. The former impacts the stability of the redox carrier towards oxidants such as O2, while the later determines the concentration levels of CO2 that can be captured. Quinones have been heavily studied as redox carriers. However, the impact of electrolyte on these properties has not been systematically explored. The reduction potential and the CO2 binding constant for 6 quinones and 3 alkylammonium hexafluorophophate electrolytes are quantified in acetonitrile. While alkylammonium cations are often considered inert and interchangeable, our studies show up to 100 mV changes in reduction potential with minimal changes to the CO2 binding constant.

The design of multimetal catalysts holds immense significance for efficient CO2 capture and its conversion into economically valuable chemicals. Herein, heterobimetallic catalysts (MiMo)L were exploited for the CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR) using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The octadentate Pacman-like polypyrrolic ligand (H4L) accommodates two metal ions (Mo, W, Nd, and U) inside (Mi) and outside (Mo) its month, rendering a weak bimetal coupling-assisted MN4 catalytically active site. Adsorption reactions have access to energetically stable coordination modes of –OCO, –OOC, and –(OCO)2, where the donor atom(s) are marked in bold. Among all of the species, (UiMoo)L releases the most energy. Along CO2RR, it favors to produce CO. The high-efficiency CO2 reduction is attributed to the size matching of U with the ligand mouth and the effective manipulation of the electron density of both ligand and bimetals. The mechanism in which heterobimetals synergetically capture and reduce CO2 has been postulated. This establishes a reference in elaborating on the complicated heterogeneous catalysis.

The synergy of pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions has been perceived as a crucial mechanism and central target for fulfilling green economic and social development in China. With the combination of the coupled coordination degree model (CCDM) and spatial autocorrelation analysis, we explored the spatio-temporal trends of coupling coordination degree (CCD) between pollution and carbon reductions in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) between 2011 and 2019, and the spatial Durbin model (SDM) was used to study the driving mechanisms behind CCD. The results demonstrate the coupling coordination degree demonstrated a staged upward trend with a heterogeneity of spatial distribution trend of "High-East, Low-West". Furthermore, the prominent spatial autocorrelation has led to the emergence of radiation effect of synergistic management in some central cities. The SDM indicated that the CCD are greatly influenced by multifarious social-economic factors such as opening-up level, population size, energy intensity, economic development, and technological advancement to varying degree. However, there was substantial discrepancy among the spatial spillover effects of contributory factors on CCD amongst cities of various synergistic categories. Based on regional disparities in synergy levels, this study proposes corresponding policy implications, including fostering cooperative governance, enhancing policy innovation, and promoting technological progress.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen‐containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO2 and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO2 and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO3‐ and CO2 reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO2 and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO2 electrocatalyst derived from MIL‐125‐NH2, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO2 reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO2, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37 mmol･g‐1･h‐1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88% at ‐0.9 V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO2 level of 15%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in‐situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.

Carbon dioxide reduction is a major step toward building a cleaner and safer environment. There is a surge of interest in exploring high-entropy alloys (HEAs) as active catalysts for CO2 reduction; however, so far, it is mainly limited to quinary HEAs. Inspired by the successful synthesis of octonary and denary HEAs, herein, the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance of an HEA composed of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, Pt, Co, Ga, Ni, and Zn is studied by developing a high-fidelity graph neural network (GNN) framework. Within this framework, the adsorption site geometry and physics are employed through the featurization of elements. Particularly, featurization is performed using various intrinsic properties, such as electronegativity and atomic radius, to enable not only the supervised learning of CO2RR performance descriptors, namely, CO and H adsorption energies, but also the learning of adsorption physics and generalization to unseen metals and alloys. The developed model evaluates the adsorption strength of ∼3.5 and ∼0.4 billion possible sites for CO and H, respectively. Despite the enormous space of the AgAuCuPdPtCoGaNiZn alloy and the rather small size of the training data, the GNN framework demonstrated high accuracy and good robustness. This study paves the way for the rapid screening and intelligent synthesis of CO2RR-active and selective HEAs.

Amorphous materials hold significant promise for enhancing electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) performance, but their intricate structures present challenges in understanding their behaviour. We present a computational investigation combining machine learning force fields and DFT calculations to explore amorphous copper (Cu) as a potential catalyst for the CO2R to C1 and C2 products. Our study reveals that amorphous Cu surfaces, compared to crystalline counterparts, offer a wider range of coordination sites, leading to a multitude of active centres for CO2 adsorption. Notably, some investigated surfaces spontaneously activate CO2, demonstrating their potential for efficient conversion. Furthermore, the intermediates of the CO2R on these surfaces exhibit enhanced stability, translating to lower overpotentials and improved selectivity. This work paves the way for further research and development in using amorphous Cu-based catalysts for sustainable CO2 conversion technologies, offering significant potential for mitigating climate change.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to multicarbon products has been widely recognized for Cu‐based catalysts. However, the structural changes in Cu‐based catalysts during the eCO2RR pose challenges to achieving an in‐depth understanding of the structure‐activity relationship, thereby limiting catalyst development. Herein, we employ constant‐potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu‐N‐C single‐atom catalysts into clusters under eCO2RR conditions. Systematic constant‐potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu‐(CO)x moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO2RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu2+ concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C2 products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu‐based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C2 products during the eCO2RR.

Copper-based tandem schemes have emerged as promising strategies to promote the formation of multi-carbon products of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. In such approaches, the CO-generating component of the tandem catalyst increases the local concentration of CO and thereby enhances the intrinsic carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling on copper. However, the optimal characteristics of the CO-generating catalyst for maximizing eventual C2 production are currently unknown. In this work, we developed tunable tandem catalysts comprising iron porphyrin (Fe-Por), as the CO-generating component, and Cu nanocubes (Cucub) to understand how the turnover frequency for CO (TOFCO) of the molecular catalysts impacts C-C coupling on the Cu surface. First, we tuned the TOFCO of the Fe-Por by varying the number of orbitals involved in the π-system. Then, by coupling these molecular catalysts with the Cucub, we assessed the current densities and faradaic efficiencies, discovering that all of the designed Fe- Por boost ethylene production. The most efficient Cucub/Fe-Por tandem catalyst was the one including the Fe-Por with the highest TOFCO and exhibited a nearly 22-fold increase in the ethylene selectivity and 100 mV positive shift of the onset potential with respect to the pristine Cucub. These results reveal that coupling the TOFCO tunability of molecular catalysts along with copper nanocatalysts opens up new possibilities towards the development of Cu-based catalysts with enhanced selectivity for multi-carbon product generation at low overpotential.

Data set for the journal article: The coupling of CO-generating molecular catalysts with copper electrodes in tandem schemes is a promising strategy to boost the formation of multi-carbon products in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. While the spatial distribution of the two components is important, this aspect remains underexplored, especially for molecular-based tandem systems. Herein, we address this knowledge gap by studying tandem catalysts comprising Co-phthalocyanine (CoPc) and Cu nanocubes (Cucub). In particular, we identify the importance of the relative spatial distributions of the two components on the performance of the tandem catalyst by preparing CoPc-Cucub/C, wherein the CoPc and Cucub share an interface, and CoPc-C/Cucub, wherein the CoPc is loaded first on carbon black (C) before mixing with the Cucub. The electrocatalytic measurements of these two catalysts show that the faradaic efficiency towards C2 products almost doubles for the CoPc-Cucub/C, whereas it decreases by half for the CoPc-C/Cucub, compared to the Cucub/C. Our results highlight the importance of a direct contact between the CO-generating molecular catalyst and the Cu to promote C-C coupling, which hints at a surface transport mechanism of the CO intermediate between the two components of the tandem catalyst instead of a transfer via CO diffusion in the electrolyte followed by re-adsorption.

Oxide-derived (OD) metals have been demonstrated as a kind of promising catalyst with superior catalytic activity for carbon dioxide electroreduction. Here we fabricate OD nanoporous silver by a simple, cost-effective electrochemical oxidation–reduction treatment, which enables reducing carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide with a Faradaic efficiency of 87% at −0.8 V vs RHE, significantly higher than that of untreated silver foil under the same conditions. Electron backscattered diffraction analysis reveals that there is a distinct grain refining during the initial CO2 electrochemical reduction from Ag oxide to OD-Ag. Experiment results indicated that the catalytic activity and selectivity are closely linked to the grain boundary and nanoporous structure on the surface, which has also been proven by theoretical calculation. However, after a long catalysis time (12 h), it was found that the surface grain coarsened and the thickness of the nanostructured layer reduced, resulting in the deactivation of the OD-Ag electrode. A dissolution–redeposition mechanism was proposed to govern the degradation of OD-Ag. The catalytic activity can be regenerated again by applying electrochemical oxidation–reduction treatment, which can increase the thickness of the porous layer and electrochemical active surface area significantly.

Conversion of CO2 to hard carbon is an interesting technology for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Recently, it was shown that CeO2 can selectively catalyze this reaction, but we still lack information regarding the reaction mechanism. Using density functional theory modeling, we explore possible reaction mechanisms that allow for the polymerization of CO2. According to our computations, the reaction is initialized by the adsorption of CO2 in an oxygen vacancy. Owing to the rich defect chemistry of ceria, a large number of suitable sites are available at the surface. C–C bond formation is achieved through an aldol condensation-type mechanism which comprises the electrochemical elimination of water to form a carbene. This carbene then performs a nucleophilic attack on CO2. The reaction mechanism possesses significant similarities to the corresponding reactions in synthetic organic chemistry. Since the mechanism is completely generic, it allows for all relevant steps of the formation of hard carbon like chain growth, chain linkage, and the formation of side chains or aromatic rings. Surprisingly, ceria mainly serves as an anchor for CO2 in an oxygen vacancy, while all other subsequent reaction steps are almost completely independent from the catalyst. These insights are important for the development of novel catalysts for CO2 reduction and may also lead to new reactions for the electrosynthesis of organic molecules.

<p>Biogas is globally recognized as a crucial source of renewable energy. After undergoing proper treatment, the purified form of biogas, known as "biomethane", has the potential to be injected into existing natural gas infrastructure or compressed for use as a vehicle fuel. The principal pollutants which cause a reduction in the energy density of biogas and impede its utilization, specifically in engines, are carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and siloxanes. Furthermore, the presence of carbon dioxide in biogas has a significant impact on global warming. In this study, the water scrubbing method, which is the most used method in biogas upgrading processes, was utilized due to its low operating cost. With the decreasing availability of clean water resources around the world and the challenges of utilizing them, the reuse of treated wastewater has become increasingly important. Therefore, in this study, treated wastewater was used as scrubbing water for biogas instead of clean water. In addition, the biogas used in the study is the gas produced in the wastewater treatment plant of a local municipality, thus contributing to the uniqueness of the study. Prior to upgrading, the biogas content produced in the plant had CH4 and CO2 values of 62% and 37%, respectively. However, after the implementation of upgraded technology, these values increased to 96% (CH4) and 3% (CO2). These results clearly demonstrate the success of the new method.</p>

ABSTRACT: Empty elliptical vesicles are observed in outcrops of Barremian very fine clayey sandstone to siltstone lacustrine slurry deposits of the Pitanga Member (Maracangalha Formation), exposed in the Maré Island, Southern Recôncavo Basin, Brazil. These sedimentary features have been traditionally interpreted as water escape structures triggered by the diapirism of the underlying shales of the Candeias Formation. This work proposes that vesicles were generated during massive gas hydrate dissociation as a result of tectonic activity in a paleolake system. Tectonic uplift would have triggered both the reduction of the confining pressure as well as an increase in lake bottom temperature, resulting in the instability of gas hydrate and causing intense release of both methane - or carbon dioxide (CO2) - and water. On one hand, this proposal has a strong impact on paleoenvironmental interpretations, giving support to the current hypothesis that rocks related to the Pitanga Member would have been deposited under water columns deep enough for gas hydrate formation and subsequent dissociation. On the other hand, it provides new insights on the genesis of fluid escape structures in sedimentary rocks, both lacustrine and marine, providing a paleobathymetric indicator.

Combustion power plants emit carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a major contributor to climate change. Direct emissions measurement is cost-prohibitive globally, while reporting varies in detail, latency, and granularity. To fill this gap and greatly increase the number of power plants worldwide with independent emissions monitoring, we developed and applied machine learning (ML) models using power plant water vapor plumes as proxy signals to estimate electric power generation and CO2 emissions using Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope imagery. Our ML models estimated power plant activity on each image snapshot, then an aggregation model predicted plant utilization over a 30-day period. Lastly, emission factors specific to region, fuel, and plant technology were used to convert the estimated electricity generation into CO2 emissions. Models were trained with reported hourly electricity generation data in the US, Europe, and Australia and were validated with additional generation and emissions data from the US, Europe, Australia, Türkiye, and India. All results with sufficiently large sample sizes indicate that our models outperformed the baseline approaches. In validating our model results against available generation and emissions reported data, we calculated the root mean square error as 1.75 TWh (236 plants across 17 countries over 4 years) and 2.18 Mt CO2 (207 plants across 17 countries over 4 years), respectively. Ultimately, we applied our ML method to plants that constitute 32% of global power plant CO2 emissions, as estimated by Climate TRACE, averaged over the period 2015–2022. This dataset is the most comprehensive independent and free-of-cost global power plant point-source emissions monitoring system currently known to the authors and is made freely available to the public to support global emissions reduction.

This study assessed the real-world emissions from two heavy-duty natural gas vehicles certified to the optional 0.02 g/bhp-hr nitrogen oxides (NOx) standard and one diesel vehicle equipped with diesel particulate filter (DPF) to control particulate matter (PM) mass emissions and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to control NOx emissions. Testing was performed on four different routes typical of goods movement in the greater South Coast Air Basin using a mobile emissions laboratory equipped with a constant volume sampling (CVS) system. This study emphasized the characterization of solid particle number (SPN) and total particle number (TPN) emissions, carbonyl compounds, as well as the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Results showed that SPN and TPN emissions were several orders of magnitude higher for the natural gas vehicles compared to those of the DPF-equipped diesel vehicle. Natural gas vehicles under motoring conditions were found to have a strong nucleation mode of ultrafine particles below 23 nm. PM mass chemical speciation of metals and trace elements indicated that the source of PM mass from natural gas vehicles was lubricant oil combustion. The low molecular weight formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein were the predominant aldehydes in the exhaust of all vehicles, with the formaldehyde emissions below the emissions limits for both diesel vehicles and natural gas vehicles. Emissions of CO2 were lower for the natural gas vehicles, as a result of the lower carbon-to-hydrogen (C/H) molar ratio of natural gas compared to diesel fuel. Similarly, the CO2 equivalent emissions for the natural gas vehicles were about 20% lower than those of the diesel vehicle. CH4 emissions were the dominant fraction of total hydrocarbons for the natural gas vehicles, while for the diesel vehicle CH4 concentrations were negligible. N2O emissions were very low for the natural gas vehicles, whereas N2O formation was favored in the SCR-equipped diesel vehicle.

ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of controlled atmosphere storage on quality of native and cultivated yerba mate produced in Arvorezinha (RS) and São Mateus do Sul (PR) after 0, 3, 6 and 12 months of storage under ambient conditions, low oxygen (1.0 kPa) and high carbon dioxide (3.0 kPa) partial pressures. Total chlorophyll concentration reduced over the storage period regardless of the atmosphere condition, form of cultivation and production region. Total carotenoids, regardless of the form and place of cultivation, decreased until three months of storage under 1.0 kPa O2. Although, the O2 reduction to 1.0 kPa maintains greener color and higher chlorophyll concentration after 12 months of storage. High carbon dioxide partial pressures (3.0 kPa) in the storage chamber increases the polyphenol concentration until six months of storage. The raw material originated from São Mateus do Sul (PR) has higher chlorophyll concentration and greener color, resulting in greater storage potential.

Emissions reduction and greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere are both necessary to achieve net-zero emissions and limit climate change.1 There is thus a need for improved sorbents for the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process known as direct air capture. In particular, low-cost materials that can be regenerated at low temperatures would overcome the limitations of current technologies. In this work, we introduce a new class of designer sorbent materials known as “charged-sorbents”. These materials are prepared through a battery-like charging process which accumulates ions in the pores of low-cost activated carbons, with the inserted ions then serving as adsorption sites for carbon dioxide adsorption. We use our charging process to accumulate reactive hydroxide ions in the pores of a carbon electrode, and find that the resulting sorbent material can rapidly capture carbon dioxide from ambient air via (bi)carbonate formation. Unlike traditional bulk carbonates, charged-sorbent regeneration can be achieved at low temperatures (90-100 ºC), and the sorbent's conductive nature permits direct Joule heating regeneration2,3 using renewable electricity. Given their highly tailorable pore environments and low cost, we anticipate that charged-sorbents will find numerous potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis, and beyond.

Micronutrient malnutrition is widespread and is linked with diets low in fruit and vegetables. However, during the twentieth century, declines in essential minerals in fruits and vegetables were reported in the UK and elsewhere. A new analysis of long-term trends of the mineral content of fruits and vegetables from three editions of the UK’s Composition of Foods Tables (1940, 1991 and 2019) was undertaken. All elements except P declined in concentrations between 1940 and 2019 – the greatest overall reductions during this 80-year period were Na (52%), Fe (50%), Cu (49%) and Mg (10%); water content increased (1%). There could be many reasons for these reductions, including changes in crop varieties and agronomic factors associated with the industrialisation of agriculture. Increases in carbon dioxide could also play a role. We call for a thorough investigation of these reductions and steps to be taken to address the causes that could contribute to global malnutrition.

Summary Carbon dioxide is an abundant carbon resource for chemical and fuel synthesis. Formic acid, vital for hydrogen storage, has numerous applications. Covalent organic frameworks are a unique class of materials composed of interconnected organic building blocks through covalent bonds. They possess porosity and functional groups, making them suitable for creating supported metallic catalysts. In this study, we present a strategy that utilizes covalent organic frameworks with diverse structures and chemical compositions to enhance carbon dioxide hydrogenation to formic acid at low temperatures. This enhancement arises from both high density of single-atom ruthenium sites and their intrinsic activity. Operando X-ray absorption and catalytic tests demonstrate that the concentration of nitrogen functional groups affects the intrinsic single-site ruthenium activity, whereas the impact of oxygen-containing groups is minor. Catalyst stability is attributed to the ability of single atoms to resist reduction to metallic state. This strategy has broad applicability for various covalent organic framework-supported single-atom catalysts.

This data supports the study to assess the impacts of climate change on terrestrial hydrological components and Crop Water Requirement (CWR) over the Chesapeake Bay watershed using a combination of Global Climate Models (GCMs) and a land surface model. To better understand the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle, long-term simulations of multiple earth system models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP Phase 5) are statistically downscaled and bias-corrected using Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) scheme for use as model forcings. Precipitation indices from the twenty MACA-based GCMs are used to identify six best performing models. A mesoscale approach is developed, where CWR is estimated by accounting for the impacts of changing climate conditions and rising carbon dioxide levels. Daily grid-based crop coefficients are derived from evapotranspiration data. The findings indicate an annual increase of 18% in evapotranspiration and an annual decrease of 5% in streamflow for the RCP 8.5 scenario towards the end of the 21st century. A reduction of 13% and 17% in CWR is observed for corn and soybeans, respectively due to wetter antecedent soil moisture conditions resulting from increased total precipitation and rising carbon dioxide levels. This mesoscale approach can be scaled globally to project CWR for use in data-scarce agricultural regions and enabling better management of water resources.

Abstract Hydroalcoholic extracts prepared by conventional methods (in stirred vessel at 25 °C and 1 bar) and, hydroalcoholic and supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) extracts prepared in fixed bed extractors (60 ºC and 400 bar) were obtained from pitanga leaves (Eugenia uniflora L.) in order to recover phenolic compounds. Hydroalcoholic and ethanolic extracts obtained in fixed bed were further fractionated in four separators by gradual pressure reduction, using scCO2 as an antisolvent. All extracts and fractions were characterized in terms of extraction yield and the presence of total phenolics and flavonoids. Solvents were found to significantly influence the extraction yields and composition. Yields increased as a function of polarity, whereas the hydroalcoholic extractions displayed the highest yields and the highest amounts of extracted phenols and flavonoids.

The effect of initial total solids (TS) concentration on volatile fatty acid (VFAs) production from food waste under mesophilic conditions (35 °C) was determined. VFAs concentration and composition, biogas production, soluble chemical oxygen demand concentration, TS and volatile solids (VS) reduction, and ammonia nitrogen release were investigated. The VFAs concentrations were 26.10, 39.68, 59.58, and 62.64 g COD/L at TS contents of 40, 70, 100, and 130 g/L, respectively. While the VFAs’ yields ranged from 0.467 to 0.799 g COD/g VSfed, decreased as initial TS increased. The percentage of propionate was not affected by TS concentration, accounting for 30.19–34.86% of the total VFAs, while a higher percentage of butyrate and lower percentage of acetate was achieved at a higher TS concentration. Biogas included mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide and the maximum hydrogen yield of 148.9 ml/g VSfed was obtained at 130 g TS/L. concentration, TS and VS reductions increased as initial TS increased. Considering the above variables, we conclude that initial TS of 100 g/L shall be the most appropriate to VFAs production.

ABSTRACT The central venous minus arterial carbon dioxide pressure to arterial minus central venous oxygen content ratio (Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2) has been proposed as a surrogate for respiratory quotient and an indicator of tissue oxygenation. Some small observational studies have found that a Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 > 1.4 was associated with hyperlactatemia, oxygen supply dependency, and increased mortality. Moreover, Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 has been incorporated into algorithms for tissue oxygenation evaluation and resuscitation. However, the evidence for these recommendations is quite limited and of low quality. The goal of this narrative review was to analyze the methodological bases, the pathophysiologic foundations, and the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the use of Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 as a surrogate for respiratory quotient. Physiologically, the increase in respiratory quotient secondary to critical reductions in oxygen transport is a life-threatening and dramatic event. Nevertheless, this event is easily noticeable and probably does not require further monitoring. Since the beginning of anaerobic metabolism is indicated by the sudden increase in respiratory quotient and the normal range of respiratory quotient is wide, the use of a defined cutoff of 1.4 for Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 is meaningless. Experimental studies have shown that Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 is more dependent on factors that modify the dissociation of carbon dioxide from hemoglobin than on respiratory quotient and that respiratory quotient and Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 may have distinct behaviors. Studies performed in critically ill patients have shown controversial results regarding the ability of Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 to predict outcome, hyperlactatemia, microvascular abnormalities, and oxygen supply dependency. A randomized controlled trial also showed that Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 is useless as a goal of resuscitation. Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 should be carefully interpreted in critically ill patients.

Abstract In this work, vapor - liquid (VLE) equilibrium for the binary system carbon dioxide (1) + coumarin (2) at high pressures was measured by a static synthetic method using a variable-volume view cell. Experimental data were obtained in the temperature range of 318 - 338 K and pressures up to 20 MPa. Coumarin molar fraction ranged from 3.0x10-3 to 6.0x10-3. Coumarin melting point reduction at high pressures was observed. The experimental results were modeled using the Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state with van der Waals quadratic mixing rules (vdW - QMRs), providing a good representation of the experimental phase equilibrium data. Critical properties and the acentric factor were estimated using the Constantinou and Gani method, which showed to be satisfactory on the quality of data correlation. Results indicate coumarin solubility increases with increasing phase transition pressure at a given temperature.

Abstract Due to the importance of swine production in Brazil, there is a need to understand the environmental impact generated by the construction materials used in the production of rural facilities, especially in the construction of biodigesters, as these facilities play an important role in the sustainability of production systems. Considering the relevance of the volume of concrete used in the construction of biodigesters for the management and treatment of swine waste, this research study sought to evaluate the emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 Eq.) in different concrete mix scenarios. For that purpose, a computational ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) model was developed to predict and analyse CO 2 Eq. emissions during the life cycle of materials adopted in conventional concrete. The results indicate that the proper choice of dosage can lead to a reduction of 31.41% in CO 2 Eq. emissions, for concrete from 30 to 40 MPa. This represents a promising proposal for reducing the environmental impact of the production of concrete constructions, which has the potential to stimulate further research in this area.

Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) will be necessary to fulfil the hundreds of pledges to reach net-zero by 2050. As with any industry, standard methodologies and certification are crucial to guarantee successful and reliable activities. However, buyers and policymakers currently face challenges in evaluating the ecosystem of CDR certification. The issue is not with CDR, nor with individual certifications – some of which may be very robust – but with the lack of transparency in the overall ecosystem. To bring some clarity, we present a snapshot of the CDR certification and standards ecosystem for the year 2021–2022. We find a complex ecosystem with at least 30 standard developing organizations proposing at least 125 standard methodologies for carbon removal from 23 different CDR activities and selling 27 different versions of certification instruments in voluntary and compliance markets. This exercise reveals many more existing standards for nature-based than for engineering-based activities and more diversity from standards serving the voluntary rather than the compliance market. It also highlights a proliferation of standards for the same activity, and a plethora of activities without standards. The process revealed ambiguity on what constitutes carbon removal, with many standards certifying activities that remove CO2 already in the environment as well as activities that avoid or reduce new emissions by sequestering the carbon into reservoirs. This mapping highlights key gaps and potential starting points for reforms to strengthen the CDR certification industry; it also underscores the need for independent oversight. The CDR certification ecosystem is complex and evolving rapidly, raising questions about oversight and quality.Targeted support would be necessary for the timely development of standards for nascent but promising CDR activities, and oversight would be required to ensure the quality of certification.Ensuring a minimum quality would require clarifying the treatment of emission reduction, removal, and avoidance, amongst other concerns.

Reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from the building sector are mandatory for climate protection. This calls for both a reduction of the construction material and energy as well as a reduction of the operational energy. Against this background, a novel facade-integrated adsorption system for solar cooling of lightweight buildings is proposed and theoretically investigated in this work. For this purpose, a detailed simulation model is developed to analyze both the processes in the single components as well as the overall system behavior. The proposed system consists of the three components adsorber, condenser and evaporator, which are connected vacuum-tight and are coupled by vapor transfer. The simulation results of a defined reference case yield cooling rates of 54 W per installed square meter of adsorber facade. The cooling power can be maintained for 12 h, confirming the applicability of the proposed system. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is carried out in order to identify an optimum set of parameter values for maximum cooling rate under the assumed conditions. The results reveal that controlled constant cooling rates of 105 W per square meter of adsorber facade can be reached and a maximum peak power of 145 W per square meter of adsorber facade is possible.

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have attracted considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts in reactions central to energy conversion and chemical transformation. In contrast to monometallic nanocrystals and metal alloys, SAAs possess unique and intriguing physicochemical properties, positioning them as ideal model systems for studying structure–property relationships. However, the field is still in its early stages. In this Perspective, we first review and summarize rational synthesis methods and advanced characterization techniques for SAA nanoparticle catalysts. We then emphasize the extensive applications of SAAs in a range of electrocatalytic reactions, including fuel cell reactions, water splitting, and carbon dioxide and nitrate reductions. Finally, we provide insights into existing challenges and prospects associated with the controlled synthesis, characterization, and design of SAA catalysts.

Abstract. Marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) approaches are under development to mitigate the effects of climate change with potential co-benefits of local reduction of ocean acidification impacts. One such method is ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE). A specific OAE method that avoids issues of solid dissolution kinetics and the release of impurities into the ocean is the generation of aqueous alkalinity via electrochemistry to enhance the alkalinity of the surrounding water and extract acid from seawater. While electrochemical acid extraction is a promising method for increasing the carbon dioxide sequestration potential of the ocean, the biological effects of this method are relatively unknown. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing the effects of increased pH and alkalinity, delivered in the form of aqueous base, on two ecologically important eelgrass epifauna in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, Taylor’s sea hare (Phyllaplysia taylori) and eelgrass isopod (Idotea resecata), across pH treatments ranging from 7.8 to 9.3. Four-day experiments were conducted in closed bottles to allow measurements of the evolution of carbonate species throughout the experiment with water refreshed twice daily to maintain elevated pH. Sea hares experienced mortality in all pH treatments, ranging from 40 % mortality at pH 7.8 to 100 % mortality at pH 9.3. Isopods experienced lower mortality rates in all treatment groups, which did not significantly increase with higher pH treatments. Different invertebrate species will likely have different responses to increased pH and alkalinity, depending on their physiological vulnerabilities. Investigation of the potential vulnerabilities of local marine species will help inform the decision-making process regarding mCDR planning and permitting.

Abstract The reduction of emissions from shipping is necessary to combat climate change. One viable option is to change the fuels utilized. In this study, we investigate the environmental and economic performance of marine diesel oil (MDO), liquified natural gas (LNG), liquified biogas (LBG), and a mixture of LNG and LBG. We study a real case of a roll-on/roll-off passenger ship (RoPax) in Finland. Life cycle thinking is applied to assess the environmental impact, covering emissions from well to propeller (raw material extraction, fuel production, transportation, storage, and combustion), while the economic implications are estimated through future fuel prices and carbon pricing from 2023 to 2050. The carbon pricing covers different carbon tax schemes, namely stated policies scenario (STEPS), sustainable development scenarios (SDS), and net-zero emissions (NZE). STEPS reflects the existing measures and policies under development; SDS pursues to meet the goal of Paris Agreement, while NZE aims to reach net zero. Adopting LNG would improve carbon dioxide emissions, but the overall climate change impact was not significantly lower than MDO. It is also found that the biggest environmental improvement can be obtained by switching to LBG, although future availability can be an issue. The economic assessment shows that LBG has the highest fuel price uncertainties, although its carbon cost will be the lowest. Alternatively, using LNG & LBG mixture can serve as a transition path to contain climate change while dealing with its price uncertainty and availability.

## Air Quality and Climate Connections

Multiple linkages connect air quality and climate change. Many air pollutant sources also emit carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). The two main contributors to non-attainment of U.S. ambient air quality standards, ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM), interact with radiation, forcing climate change. PM warms by absorbing sunlight (e.g., black carbon) or cools by scattering sunlight (e.g., sulfates) and interacts with clouds; these radiative and microphysical interactions can induce changes in precipitation and regional circulation patterns. Climate change is expected to degrade air quality in many polluted regions by changing air pollution meteorology (ventilation and dilution), precipitation and other removal processes, and by triggering some amplifying responses in atmospheric chemistry and in anthropogenic and natural sources. Together, these processes shape distributions and extreme episodes of O3 and PM. Global modeling indicates that as air pollution programs reduce SO2 to meet health and other air quality goals, near-term warming accelerates due to “unmasking” of warming induced by rising CO2. Air pollutant controls on CH4, a potent GHG and precursor to global O3 levels, and on sources with high black carbon (BC) to organic carbon (OC) ratios could offset near-term warming induced by SO2 emission reductions, while reducing global background O3 and regionally high levels of PM. Lowering peak warming requires decreasing atmospheric CO2, which for some source categories would also reduce co-emitted air pollutants or their precursors. Model projections for alternative climate and air quality scenarios indicate a wide range for U.S. surface O3 and fine PM, although regional projections may be confounded by interannual to decadal natural climate variability. Continued implementation of U.S. NOx emission controls guards against rising pollution levels triggered either by climate change or by global emission growth. Improved accuracy and trends in emission inventories are critical for accountability analyses of historical and projected air pollution and climate mitigation policies.Implications: The expansion of U.S. air pollution policy to protect climate provides an opportunity for joint mitigation, with CH4 a prime target. BC reductions in developing nations would lower the global health burden, and for BC-rich sources (e.g., diesel) may lessen warming. Controls on these emissions could offset near-term warming induced by health-motivated reductions of sulfate (cooling). Wildfires, dust, and other natural PM and O3 sources may increase with climate warming, posing challenges to implementing and attaining air quality standards. Accountability analyses for recent and projected air pollution and climate control strategies should underpin estimated benefits and trade-offs of future policies.

Abstract Considering the microbial safety of consumption of raw foods (Asian food), this study aimed to explore the inactivation S. aureus in raw salmon by supercritical CO2 treatment (SC-CO2). For this purpose, experimental design methodology was employed as a tool to evaluate the effects of pressure (120-220 bar), the depressurization rate (10 to 100 bar.min–1) and the salmon:CO2 mass relation (1:0.2 to 1:1.0). It was observed that the pressure and the depressurization rate was statistically significant, i.e. the higher the system pressure and depressurization rate, the greater the microbial inactivation. The salmon: CO2 mass relation did not influence the S. aureus inactivation in raw salmon. There was a total reduction in S. aureus with 225 bar, a depressurizing rate of 100 bar.min–1, a salmon: CO2 mass relation of 1:0.6, for 2 hours at 33 °C.

Abstract This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance– surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR–SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1–13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied here to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2–7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions— lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency—showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.

Caves are windows to the extreme habitats of deep subsurface, and provide answers of unknowns about the underground life. Furthermore, sulfidic caves are important analogues for the early Earth environments, since some environmental conditions are common, such as high sulfur concentration, high temperature and oxygen-poor conditions. Kaklik Cave (Denizli, Turkey) with its travertine formation, carbonate- and sulfur-rich thermal springs, exhibits a unique ecosystem as a sulfidic cave. This study represents the first molecular survey of the microbial community in the Kaklik Cave, Turkey using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis. An average of 859–2,416 operational taxonomic units per sample were observed including 25 bacterial phyla and 3 archaeal phyla. The bacterial diversity profiles were generally dominated by Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. At the carbonate-rich hot spring, that formed travertine structure, 9.7% of sequence reads affiliated with Thiofaba spp. In contrast, 38.74% of the total sequence reads at the sulfidic hot spring samples associated with the genus Sulfurimonas and Sulfurovum. In the archaeal community composition, Thermoplasmata was the most abundant group in all sampling areas. The 454-pyrotag results provide leads about ammonia-, nitrite- and sulfur-oxidation as well as sulfur-reduction, carbon dioxide fixation, and nitrogen fixation.

Abstract This study presents a comprehensive analysis of atmospheric parameters in Nigeria, utilizing Sentinel-5P and 3A/B offline datasets from April 2018 to December 2022. The research evaluates the concentrations of pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2 ), Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2 ), Ozone (O 3 ), Formaldehyde (HCHO), Methane (CH 4 ), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Aerosol Indices (AI) across different periods. The data analysis employs multivariate techniques, including Factor Analysis, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Scatter Plots, and Dendrogram Clustering, providing insights into the interrelationships and potential sources of pollution. Additionally, the study examines monthly trends, temperature variations, and their impacts on human health and climate. The findings reveal stable levels of NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , and HCHO with minimal fluctuations, while CH 4 and CO exhibit slight variations, possibly influenced by emission reductions or atmospheric changes. Aerosol optical indices consistently indicate aerosol presence, influenced by local emissions and atmospheric processes. Multivariate analyses highlight shared patterns among atmospheric constituents, shedding light on potential common sources and chemical relationships. The Pearson correlation coefficients illustrate the strength and direction of linear relationships, offering valuable information on pollution dynamics. The study's visualizations, including scatter plots and dendrogram clustering, enhance the understanding of complex interactions. Overall, the research underscores the significance of continuous monitoring and research efforts for informed decision-making and environmental management in Nigeria.

Abstract Sea level rise (SLR) due to anthropogenic warming poses substantial threats to coastal environments and human societies. Despite successful climate mitigation efforts, regional reversibility of SLR in response to stabilization or reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) remains unclear. Here, we investigate sea level fluctuations in Subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) using idealized CO 2 ramp-up and -down experiments. We found that during ramp-up period, the SPNA experiences a faster SLR than the global mean, followed by a more rapid decline with decreasing CO 2 . These dramatic sea level fluctuations are mainly driven by the response of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) to CO 2 forcing. The enhanced meridional salinity transport triggered by the rapid AMOC recovery plays a crucial role in the recovery of the SPNA sea level. Our study highlights the potential for abrupt sea level changes in the SPNA and surrounding coastal areas under climate mitigation scenarios.

The tourism industry needs strategies to reduce emissions and hasten the achievement of global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission reduction targets. Using a case study approach, we estimated CO 2 emissions related to park tourism in Yellowstone National Park (USA) generated from transit to and from the park, transit within the park, accommodations, and park operations. Results indicate tourism to Yellowstone National Park produces an estimated 1.03 megaton (1.03 billion kg) of CO 2 -equivalent emissions annually, with an average of 479 kg CO 2 per visitor. Almost 90% of these emissions were attributable to transit to and from the destination, while 5% were from transit within the park, 4% from overnight accommodations, and about 1% from other park operations (e.g., visitor centers, museums, shops, restaurants, etc.). Visitors who fly only made up about 35% of all visitors, but produced 72% of the emissions related to transit to and from the park. Future scenarios that alter transit to and from the park can reduce emissions the most; this includes a greater proportion of local or regional visitors, fewer visitors flying, and increased fuel efficiency of vehicles. The method developed in this work, and applied specifically to Yellowstone National Park, can be adopted elsewhere and used to help decision makers evaluate the effectiveness of potential emission reduction strategies.

ABSTRACT Objective: To analyze the effect of air pollution on heart rate variability in overweight individuals. Methods: A total of 46 adult individuals, both sexes, aged between 18 and 49 years and with body mass index >25kg/m2 were analyzed. All volunteers were students from public schools of two cities in the state of São Paulo. The clinical, demographic and anthropometric data of each individual, as well as heart rate variability through time domain, geometric and frequency indices were collected. For the air quality analysis, the following variables were investigated: concentration of carbon dioxide, particulate matter, temperature and relative humidity. The analysis was carried out with descriptive and analytical statistics, adopting a level of significance of 5%. Results: There was a reduction in overall heart rate variability in overweight individuals by the following indices: mean standard deviation of all normal RR intervals, long-term standard deviation of continuous RR intervals, ratio of short-and long-term standard deviation of continuous RR intervals. In addition, the indices responsible for parasympathetic control showed a downward trend in their values, as well as the low frequency index, which represented sympathetic action, although not significant. Conclusion: Overweight individuals exposed to air pollution had lower heart rate variability than the Control Group.

Abstract Paper aims This study aims to analyze the travel behaviors changings and the emissions reduction of CO2, CO, NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) promoted by the bicycle sharing system in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Originality The bicycle sharing systems have been experiencing rapid development in recent years, however, few empirical studies explore comprehensively the externalities of bicycle sharing, seeking to quantify the impacts of this travel system type on urban transport. Research method The research method used a modal distribution model calibrated with stated preference interviews and travel data provided by Tembici company. Main findings Results indicated a reduction in 2018 CO2 emissions compared to the existing system in 2014, not only because of the increase in the bicycle sharing system offer, but also due to a higher transfer rates from motorized transport to bicycle, particularly those originated from public transport and Transportation Network Company (TNC) services. Implications for theory and practice Results reveal the bicycle sharing in the city of Rio de Janeiro should be understood as a part of a process of adopting multimodality, with effective reductions achieved by the incentive to change passenger’s travel behavior.

ABSTRACT The consolidation of concrete as the second most consumed material in the world has instigated the search for solutions to reduce clinker consumption and CO2 emissions. Aiming to provide a contribution to environmental sustainability and the cement industry, this research seeks to analyze the economic viability of self-compacting concrete (SCC) with low cement consumption. A study of the optimization of the granular skeleton and the composition of the paste was carried out using the Gomes (2002) dosing method for the SCC. Reductions of up to 25% of the cement consumption were measured in relation to the reference SCC. Regarding the relative cement consumption and unit cost indexes per MPa developed in 1 m3 of concrete, it was verified that the SCC’s with low cement consumption showed reductions of up to 34.75% and 16.83%, respectively, while being compared to the reference SCC. The greater effectiveness in the reduction of the consumption relative to the mechanical resistance to compression than in the consumption of cement per cubic meter of concrete observed, is due to the observation of higher levels of mechanical resistance to compression for the composition with lower paste volume and higher proximity to the optimal void index found in the aggregate packaging stage. This result shows that even in the lower dosage circumstances, the mechanical compressive strength can be increased, thus demonstrating the technical and financial superiority of the SCC with low cement consumption compared to conventional SCC dosages, in addition to the sustainability gains obtained by the reduction of the clinker consumption and the CO2 emissions inherent to the lower amount of cement mass per cubic meter of concrete.

ABSTRACT The residual catalyst (CR) from Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) in petroleum refineries has been studied as pozzolan in cementitious materials to evaluate the development of mechanical properties and durability. However, studies on the degradation of these materials with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) are recent. This article evaluates the degradation of hardened pastes with replacement of cement mass by CR (0%, 15% and 30% CR) exposed for 7 h to scCO2, in the temperature and pressure condition estimated at 760 m depth (53,55 °C / 12,41 MPa). The density of the slurries was set at 1.89 g/cm3 and curing time of 28 days. The formulation of the slurries and supercritical condition aimed to simulate the application in the structure of an onshore well in the northeast of Brazil, considering that the contact with scCO2 happens after the hardening of the slurries. The microstructure was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermal Analysis (TG / DTG and DTA), hardness measured by Rockwell surface hardness (HR15T) and carbonated areas calculated after the pH indicator solution was sprayed. The slurries containing CR had reduced surface hardness and higher free water content, indicating a higher porosity in relation to pure cement slurries. The pozzolanic reactions of CR caused partial reduction of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] content and formation of cementitious compounds [C-S-H, C-A-S-H, C-A-H and Af(t)]. After exposure to scCO2, the pastes with CR had a larger area/depth of carbonation than the 0% CR paste. The formation of CaCO3 resulted in an increase in surface hardness mainly in the pastes with CR. Due to the reactions with scCO2, the CR-containing pastes had partially decalcified cementitious compounds but remained equivalent to or higher than those found in the 0% CR paste whose carbonatation caused a partial reduction of Ca(OH)2.

Achieving carbon emission reduction in agriculture has become a key issue in promoting agricultural modernization. However, the continued open crop straw burning (OCSB) in China has exerted enormous pressure on agricultural modernization. Related research mostly focused on the synergic relationship between CO2 emission and agricultural modernization level (AML), ignoring the nonlinear response of agriculture emission to AML and regional differences, especially OCSB CO2 emission. Thus, based on the fire point data and crop straw yield, the OCSB CO2 emission of prefecture-level cities in China was calculated, and the AML was measured by constructing an evaluation index system of 23 indicators. With the constraint lines and restricted cubic splines (RCSs), their underexplored threshold relationships in Chinese nine agricultural zones were revealed, and targeted control areas were proposed. Results showed that during 2013–2021, Chinese OCSB CO2 emission showed an overall downward trend with a total 18,823 Mt reduction, while average AML steadily improved by 0.026. Significant negative U-shaped relationship was found between OCSB CO2 emission and AML, while OCSB CO2 emission attained the potential extreme values when AML reached 0.349. Meanwhile, AML thresholds varied significantly across the agricultural zones as OCSB CO2 emission from different crops reached the potential extreme values. Accordingly, cities were spatially divided into three types of control areas: priority prevention area, centralized remediation area, and strictly controlled area. We quantified OCSB CO2 emission and AML of prefecture-level cities and identified potential high OCSB CO2 emission areas, which can provide data support and differentiated management countermeasures for low-carbon agricultural development in various agricultural zones of China.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) of major arterial vascular territories, particularly in the contralateral hemodynamically unaffected hemisphere, in patients with unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) steno-occlusive disease compared to control subjects with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, twenty-seven patients with right-sided unilateral ICA steno-occlusive disease (age range, 25 to 91 years; 17 males) and twenty-one patients with left-sided unilateral ICA steno-occlusive disease (age range, 24 to 83 years; 14 males) and 41 control subjects were studied. CVR was quantitated as the change in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI signal (as a surrogate of cerebral blood flow), in response to a consistently applied step change in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The CVR of each major arterial vascular territory was assessed in the ipsilateral hemodynamically affected hemisphere and compared to the corresponding territory in the contralateral hemisphere. Results: In patients, a significant reduction in CVR was observed in the ipsilateral anterior circulation compared to that of the corresponding territory on the contralateral side (0.027 ± 0.083 vs. 0.109 ± 0.066% BOLD change/​mm Hg, p < 0.0001) and to controls (0.195 ± 0.054% BOLD change/mm Hg, p < 0.0001). The CVR of the contralateral anterior circulation was reduced on average by 50% compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The implication of these findings is that unilateral carotid stenosis affects the vascular reserve of both sides of the brain compared to control subjects. This indicates that the collateral blood flow support from the contralateral to the ipsilateral hemisphere comes at a cost of reduced reserve capacity in the contralateral hemisphere. The findings suggest that there may be a reduction in functional hyperemia associated with neuronal activation, not only affecting the hemisphere ipsilateral to an occlusion, but also the hemisphere contralateral to an occlusion. It remains to be determined if ‘stealing' from the ‘rich' to support the ‘poor' has clinical consequences over the long term.

The success of electrochemical CO2 reduction at high current densities hinges on precise interfacial transportation and the local concentration of gaseous CO2. However, the creation of efficient CO2 transportation channels remains an unexplored frontier. In this study, we design and synthesize hydrophobic porous Cu2O spheres with varying pore sizes to unveil the nanoporous channel's impact on gas transfer and triple-phase interfaces. The hydrophobic channels not only facilitate rapid CO2 transportation but also trap compressed CO2 bubbles to form abundant and stable triple-phase interfaces, which are crucial for high-current-density electrocatalysis. In CO2 electrolysis, in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory results reveal that atomic edges of concave surfaces promote C–C coupling via an energetically favorable OC-COH pathway, leading to overwhelming CO2-to-C2+ conversion. Leveraging optimal gas transportation and active site exposure, the hydrophobic porous Cu2O with a 240 nm pore size (P-Cu2O-240) stands out among all the samples and exhibits the best CO2-to-C2+ productivity with remarkable Faradaic efficiency and formation rate up to 75.3 ± 3.1% and 2518.2 ± 8.1 μmol h–1 cm–2, respectively. This study introduces a novel paradigm for efficient electrocatalysts that concurrently addresses active site design and gas-transfer challenges.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a widely employed half‐electrode reaction in oxygen electrochemistry, in applications such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, ammonia synthesis, and electrocatalytic hydrogenation. Unfortunately, its slow kinetics limits the commercialization of such applications. It is therefore highly imperative to develop highly robust electrocatalysts with high activity, long‐term durability, and low noble‐metal contents. Previously intensive efforts have been made to introduce the advancements on developing non‐precious transition metal electrocatalysts and their OER mechanisms. Electronic structure tuning is one of the most effective and interesting ways to boost OER activity and spin angular momentum is an intrinsic property of the electron. Therefore, modulation on the spin states and the magnetic properties of the electrocatalyst enables the changes on energy associated with interacting electron clouds with radical absorbance, affecting the OER activity and stability. Given that few review efforts have been made on this topic, in this review, the‐state‐of‐the‐art research progress on spin‐dependent effects in OER will be briefed. Spin engineering strategies, such as strain, crystal surface engineering, crystal doping, etc., will be introduced. The related mechanism for spin manipulation to boost OER activity will also be discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the development of spin catalysis are presented. This review aims to highlight the significance of spin engineering in breaking the bottleneck of electrocatalysis and promoting the practical application of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts.

The slow startup and suboptimal efficiency of microbial carbon sequestration and methane-production systems have not been fully resolved despite their contribution to sustainable energy production and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These systems often grapple with persistent hurdles, including interference from miscellaneous bacteria and the slow enrichment of methanogens. To address these issues, this paper examines the synergistic effect of coupling β-lactam antibiotics with an electrolytic cell on the methanogenic process. The results indicated that β-lactam antibiotics exhibited inhibitory effects on Campylobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (two types of miscellaneous bacteria), reducing their relative abundance by 53.03% and 87.78%, respectively. Nevertheless, it also resulted in a decrease in hydrogenogens and hindered the CO2 reduction pathway. When coupled with an electrolytic cell, sufficient electrons were supplied for CO2 reduction to compensate for the hydrogen deficiency, effectively mitigating the side effects of antibiotics. Consequently, a substantial improvement in methane production was observed, reaching 0.57 mL·L−1·d−1, exemplifying a remarkable 6.3-fold increase over the control group. This discovery reinforces the efficiency of methanogen enrichment and enhances methane-production levels.

The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a reaction with a promise to provide a gainful means of utilizing an abundant greenhouse gas, methane, to produce ethylene; one of the world's most important chemicals is challenged by the co-production of carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas. The need to find efficient means of enhancing the reaction with a yield of the desirable C2 product and the reduction in the co-production of COx product continues to be the focus of increased research over the past two decades. The advent of modern computational techniques, including Density Functional Theory (DFT), and data analytical techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML), have inspired new ways of generating data and drawing intuition on the ways to improve the efficacy of the OCM reaction. This study focuses on highlighting the innovations carried out in the study of the OCM reaction over the last 22 years: the reaction mechanism, kinetics, and catalytic design. Despite the concerted efforts to model and design new catalysts, the development of improved catalysts that are selective for C2 yields higher than 30% at low temperatures continues to be a bottleneck in the process. The application of ML and DFT in OCM is poised to provide a means to predict, design, and develop new catalysts that will enhance the effectiveness of the reaction and the quality of the products. Both techniques provide opportunities to improve and ameliorate challenges bedeviling the OCM reaction, including the high activation energy, low C2 yield, and catalyst instability/deactivation.

With demand for jet fuel expected to more than double by 2050 and triple by 2070, continued and accelerated efforts to decarbonize the global aviation sector are needed to curtail rising emissions and avert the worst outcomes of climate change. In response to this call-to-action, the United States has unveiled the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge, which seeks to expedite the development of alternative fuel pathways that offer a minimum of a 50% reduction in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. However, there is growing concern on whether sufficient biomass will be readily available to satisfy the projected sharp rise in demand for SAF. Carbon dioxide point-source emissions combined with rising supply from direct air capture efforts have the potential to complement and offset any supply gaps for biomass-derived SAF and other use cases. Independent of the chosen feedstock and conversion technology, numerous challenges persist across SAF production in seeking to drive down fuel cost and carbon intensity. To hit the 2030 target of 3 billion gal/yr, this means about a 100% compound annual growth rate in volumetric SAF production (about 130 times scale-up) will need to be realized. To achieve the stretch goal of 35 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2050, volumetric production must increase by a factor of 12 from the 3-billion-gal/year 2030 target of SAF Grand Challenge. The comparatively longer runway for 2050 combined with significant production volume growth suggests a more inclusive "all-hands-on-deck"-style approach will likely play a role. A key component in success lies in the coordinated research, development, demonstration, and deployment efforts by multiple federal agencies and industry partnerships.

Peatbogs are important in global greenhouse gas budget estimates. The main aim of the work was to assess the amount of greenhouse gas emissions based on the Greenhouse Gas Emission Site Type (GEST) method and compare them with actual field measurements. The research was carried out in selected peatbog areas in the coastal zone of northern Poland. The proposed method allowed us to assess whether the restoration treatments carried out in peatbogs contributed to the emission of these gases. The results of this research using the GEST method indicate that, in the studied peatbog areas, the reduction in CO2 emissions was approximately 12%. These results were compared with actual measurements of greenhouse gas emissions made using the chamber method in 2018. The average CO2 emission for the entire peatbog was 16,338.7 t CO2-eq./yr. Comparing this result with the result obtained using the GEST method, it should be stated that it is lower by 2.464.1 t CO2-eq./year, which gives an approximately 13% overestimation of the result by the Gas Emission Site Type method.

ABSTRACT: Accidents related to the rupture of iron ore tailings dams have dramatically impacted on the Brazilian natural ecosystem. So, the development of strategies to recover soil organic matter levels and build-up Technosols are required. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of N-mineral and -organic fertilization and the rhizospheric effect on soil organic matter mineralization from Technosols built under iron ore tailings. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse; we used a factorial scheme 2 × 2 × 3: without and with the plant Crotalaria juncea ; without and with mineral fertilization; and three different organic fertilization (without organic fertilization, sewage sludge, and household waste composting), with four randomized blocks. The experimental units were PVC columns installed with a top layer of iron ore tailing from a dam, where gases were sampled to determine the CO2-C, CH4-C concentrations, and CO2-δ13C. The organic fertilization promoted a positive priming effect of 184 %. However, with mineral fertilization, no effect was observed in soil derived-CO2-C accumulated and priming effect. Similarly to non-planted soil, the planted soils with mineral and organic fertilization promoted a steady reduction in soil derived-CO2-C accumulated and rhizosphere priming effect. The soil with mineral fertilization improved in 5.52 and 0.45 g per column the shoot and root dry matter of Crotalaria when compared to the soil without mineral fertilization. In summary, the organic fertilization in Technosols built over iron ore tailings dams during revegetation was not enough to ensure the plant development and preservation of soil organic matter. However, the combination of mineral and organic fertilization promoted negative rhizosphere priming effect and a significant increase in plant biomass.

Efficient energy utilization and decarbonization of energy systems are of paramount importance in tackling global climate change. A novel distributed energy system is proposed, integrating solar photovoltaics, methanol thermochemistry, solid oxide fuel cells, gas turbines, and CO2 capture. Methanol is reformed by photovoltaic waste heat to produce solar hydrogen-rich syngas, which is then efficiently converted to electricity by solid oxide fuel cells. High-purity CO2 is separated from the anode exhaust gas containing only CO2 and H2O through low-energy penalty separation via condensation of H2O, and is subsequently compressed for storage. Analysis demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms the reference system with parabolic trough solar collectors. The total electrical efficiency of the new system reaches 51.73%, surpassing that of the reference system by 5.02 percentage points, while solar-to-electricity efficiency improves by 19.69%. The overall exergy efficiency of the proposed system reaches 57.41%. The levelized cost of electricity and cost of CO2 avoided for the proposed system are 0.1163 $/kWh and 29.87 $/t, respectively, and the dynamic payback period is only 4.5 years. Sensitivity analyses indicate outstanding power generation performance, excellent CO2 reduction potential, and wide adaptability for regional applications.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into multi-carbon containing products with high activity and selectivity still remains a big challenge. Herein, we propose a novel Cu-SACs (Cu single atoms catalyst) supported on tin-tin oxide (CuSA-Sn-SnO2) synthesized following a simple wetness impregnation and sequential reduction method for the direct conversion of CO2 into ethanol, which shows good product selectivity, activity, and stability. It is confirmed that the copper single atoms with an oxidation state close to 1 are stabilized on the Sn-SnO2 substrates. The electrochemical analysis of Sn-SnO2 displays selectivity towards other products apart from CO and H2. With the impregnation with Cu single atoms, the products on the Sn-SnO2 surface shifts from HCOOH to ethanol. With the increase in Cu content, the ethanol production increases at the expense of CO, pointing towards dimerization of C1 products. The synthesized catalyst exhibited a remarkable selectivity as high as 74 % at −0.7 V vs RHE towards ethanol production with high stability.

Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest,particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act ascarbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or “blue carbon” systems. Herewe compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collectedin pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within thesame geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The meanestimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes)were 402 78, 830 109, and 723 100 Mg C ha􀀀1, respectively, conservativelyestimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differencebetween C stocks per area (C ha􀀀1) considering each habitat type and between specificestuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasinglevels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potentialloss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 118,635tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of theseresults are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports theprotection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertaintiesof the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

Digital, practical, user-friendly tools generate actionable insights for the food industry to develop effective food waste reduction strategies. This study aimed to develop a methodology behind a digital food waste estimator that may be used to calculate the potential food waste reduction and the environmental and nutritional reach impact by extending the shelf life of foods. The methodology for this tool incorporates a straightforward algorithm and robust data sources. Additionally, two case studies were analyzed and discussed to demonstrate the tool’s application and effectiveness. The results from the food waste estimator revealed that by increasing the shelf life of poultry meat by 40%, waste could be reduced by 6–7%, CO2 emission by 457–567 kg, and water usage by 656,571–814,149 L/1000 kg of product. Meanwhile, by increasing the shelf life of bread by 20%, waste can be reduced by 5–6%, CO2 emission by 155–192 kg, and water usage by 248,000–307,520 L/1000 kg of product. This study demonstrated that the fundamental mathematical approach to and assumptions behind the food waste estimator can be effectively used to determine the potential for food waste reduction and environmental impact by extending a product’s shelf life. Extending the shelf life of food may reduce environmental impact and food waste.

The researcher examines the impact of public procurement on environmental concerns. The purpose of the study was to find out the impact of public procurement on environmental concerns. This study focused on the National Environment Management Authority as a case study. This study might help the National Environment Management Authority better advice the public on how to protect the environment through minimizing, reusing, and recycling the environment. The study was both descriptive and analytical, and the following instruments were used for collecting data: interviews, questionnaires, and documentary reviews. A sample section was used to select respondents who could participate in the research. The researcher recommends two types of public procurement. The government was to set minimum environmental standards for the procurement of a variety of goods. These standards were mandatory within the central government departments and agencies, as well as elsewhere in the public sector. The government was committed to sustainable procurement, which means only purchasing goods and services that are needed and buying items whose production, use, and disposal minimize negative impacts on the environment and society. Procurement is an important tool for helping a government meet its targets for operating sustainably, for example, by minimizing its use of energy and carbon dioxide emissions, water consumption, and waste levels, and increasing its recycling rates. Sustainable procurement also offers the opportunity and power to influence suppliers and the products they develop and design for the wider benefit of the economy and the environment. Partnership is a long-term collaborative form of relationship that is based on a high level of trust. The reason for this relationship with suppliers is risk reduction and product development to achieve better solutions.

Scientific consensus affirms human activity, particularly carbon emissions from market participants, drives global warming. Foreign investment, crucial for sustainability in developing nations, now faces scrutiny regarding its impact on environmental quality in emerging economies. This study examines the influence of Chinese Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) and fintech on environmental conditions in the top five Chinese-invested African economies, alongside factors such as energy consumption, economic performance, and unemployment affecting CO2 pollution. Quarterly data from 2006–2021 confirm cointegration among variables via panel unit root and cointegration tests. Panel ARDL method estimates coefficients for short and long-run effects. Our findings reveal: (1) A 1% increase in Chinese investment leads to a 0.56% decrease in CO2 emissions, supporting its positive environmental impact. (2) Fintech adoption also demonstrates a beneficial effect, with a 1% increase associated with a 0.18% reduction in CO2 levels. (3) Total energy consumption, as expected, has a detrimental impact, causing a 0.92% increase in CO2 emissions with a 1% rise. (4) Interestingly, economic growth fosters environmental sustainability, while unemployment correlates negatively with it. These findings suggest that targeted Chinese investments and fintech adoption can aid in mitigating CO2 pollution in African economies while balancing economic considerations.

Biodiesel contains unsaturated methyl esters making it susceptible to oxidation reaction. Among the factors that cause oxidative instability is the contamination by transition metal ions that in small quantities catalyze the oxidation reaction. The objective of this work was to evaluate the relative protection factor of rosemary extract, in biodiesel, in the presence of transition metal ions. Chromatographic analysis and characterization of biodiesel were performed as well as the quantification of total phenolic compounds and extract activity. The ions Cr3+, Co2+ and Fe2+, at a concentration of 3.95 x 10-3 mol L-1, were added to the biodiesel with and without rosemary extract. The samples were submitted to the Rancimat test and to infrared region analyses. The infrared region spectra of the samples with Cr3+ are in accordance with the least catalytic power of this ion under the biodiesel oxidation. Samples with Co2+ ions, without extract, presented bands of aldehydes, and samples with Fe2+ ions show the formation of peroxide radicals, without rosemary extract at 48h. The antioxidant effect of the extract in biodiesel is observed by the reduction of the induction period of the samples. The relative protection factor proved to be a good tool to evaluate its efficiency.

ABSTRACT: Chemical weathering and soil removal rates are responsible for the Earth’s landscape, composition of surface and groundwater, producing the soils and buffering the composition of the atmosphere. This study aimed to assess the chemical weathering and soil removal rates in the Sorocaba River basin, São Paulo State, Brazil, allowing answering the questions about the dynamics of fluvial transport of dissolved and suspended solids, the chemical weathering processes and associated atmospheric/soil CO2 consumption, and the relationship between chemical weathering and soil erosion rates. The annual specific flux of total suspended solids and total dissolved solids were 49.59 and 60.97 t/km2/yr. The chemical weathering process dominant in the Sorocaba River basin was the monosiallitization (RE = 2.4), with an associated atmospheric/soil CO2 consumption of 2.3 × 105 mol/km2/yr. The chemical weathering and soil removal rates were 7.2 and 29.8 m/Myr, respectively, indicating a soil thickness reduction. Finally, the soil removal rate in the Sorocaba River basin is almost 3-fold higher than the Cenozoic soil removal rates, being this difference related to the current land use which increased the soil removal processes.

Abstract Previously, we reported an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-1A derivative able to produce succinic acid (SA) from glycerol with net CO2 fixation. Apart from an engineered glycerol utilization pathway, the strain was equipped with the reductive branch of the TCA cycle (rTCA) and a heterologous SA exporter. However, the results indicated that a significant amount of carbon still entered the CO2-releasing oxidative TCA cycle. The current study aimed to tune down the flux through the oxidative TCA cycle by targeting the mitochondrial uptake of pyruvate and cytosolic intermediates of the rTCA pathway, as well as the succinate dehydrogenase complex. Thus, we tested the effects of deletions of MPC1, MPC3, OAC1, DIC1, SFC1, and SDH1 on SA production. The highest improvement was achieved by the combined deletion of MPC3 and SDH1. The respective strain produced up to 45.5 g/L of SA, reached a maximum SA yield of 0.66 gSA/gglycerol, and accumulated the lowest amounts of byproducts. Based on the obtained data, we consider a further reduction of mitochondrial import of pyruvate and rTCA intermediates highly attractive. Moreover, the approaches presented in the current study might also be valuable for improving SA production when sugars (instead of glycerol) are the source of carbon.

ABSTRACT The negative impacts caused by civil construction to the environment are motivated mainly by the demand for natural resources. The cement industry stands out for being responsible for about 5% of global CO2 emissions. Strategies have been used to reduce these emissions, such as increasing the performance of the binder by reducing its content in the production of concrete, through dosing methods with the particle packing. In this sense, the objective of the study was to evaluate the behavior of low-cement concrete, and addition of Plant Biomass Ash (PBA), exposed to sodium sulfate. An experimental study was carried out characterizing the materials used, an evaluation of the dimensional changes of mortar specimens and analysis of the cracking of the pieces, physical and mechanical tests on concrete submitted to two curing processes (sodium sulfate solution or conventional curing). The mix was developed with the aid of the EMMA packaging software and spreadsheet available in the literature, in which the cement content was reduced by 10, 15 and 20% by weight, replacing with PBA. The reference material showed a significant reduction in expansion when exposed to sulfate solution compared to samples submitted to conventional curing. As for mixtures added with PBA, they showed a reduction in strength when exposed for conventional curing and better behavior when exposed to the aggressive sulfate medium, both in strength and in expansion for the mixes with 10 and 15% cement reduction, the latter being considered efficient for aggressive environments.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) are among the key technologies to achieve large‐scale carbon emission reduction globally. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are considered as designable solvents, which has attracted intensive attention for CO2 capture. Here, a series of binary DESs are synthesized through one‐step mixing with the starting materials of protic ionic liquid (PIL) and amine. The eutectic behavior was investigated by measuring the melting point of PILs and amine. The saturated vapor of these DESs and industrial MDEA solution were measured and compared. These DESs are investigated to have high absorption capacity (0.1 g·g‐1 at 1.0 bar and 25ºC), superior apparent absorption rate constant (0.381 min‐1 vs 0.012 min‐1 of MDEA‐30%H2O), moderate interaction with CO2 (the enthalpy change is as low as ‐34.8 kJ·mol‐1). The absorption mechanism is also investigated by NMR analysis. Eight absorption/desorption regeneration experiments are carried out to show their reversibility. Considering the advantages, including convenience of synthesis, large absorption capacity, fast absorption rate, and moderate interaction energy as well as good regeneration, these DESs are believed to be as potential CO2 absorbent in practical applications.

ABSTRACT This study aimed to evaluate the gas exchanges and photosynthetic pigments of soursop seedlings cv. ‘Morada Nova’ irrigated with saline waters and subjected to exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide by seed soaking and foliar spraying. The study was carried out using plastic bags under greenhouse conditions at the Center of Technology and Natural Resources of the Federal University of Campina Grande, PB, Brazil, using a eutrophic Regolithic Neosol of sandy loam texture. Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design, in 5 x 5 factorial scheme, which consisted of five levels of electrical conductivity – ECw (0.7; 1.4; 2.1; 2.8 and 3.5 dS m-1) of irrigation water and five concentrations of hydrogen peroxide - H2O2 (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 µM), with four replicates and three plants per plot. As the salt stress increased, there were reductions in internal CO2 concentration, instantaneous carboxylation efficiency and water use efficiency, and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency was the most sensitive variable. Hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM attenuated the deleterious effects of water salinity on stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation rate and chlorophyll a content, and the concentration of 25 µM was the most efficient. The content of chlorophyll b and carotenoids of soursop cv. ‘Morada Nova’ had the deleterious effects caused by the salinity of irrigation water mitigated by the exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide in the concentration of 25 μM.

ABSTRACT Diuron is a widely used herbicide on pineapple cultivations. However, its application is recommended only for the implementation of the crop. The objective of this work was to evaluate the gas exchanges of four pineapple cultivars submitted to the application of the herbicide diuron at their reproductive stage. The experiment was conducted with the IAC Fantástico, Vitória, MD2 and Pérola pineapple cultivars using the active ingredient diuron at a dose of 7.5 mL L-1. Measurements of CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, vapor pressure deficit and water use efficiency were carried out weekly, by the hour, on two plants per cultivar, over a 24 hour period. These determinations were carried out two days before the application of the herbicide and 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36 days after application of the herbicide. Measurement of photochemical efficiency was performed weekly on the same dates and all these determinations were made on the ‘D’ leaf. Measurements of gas exchange were performed with an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) and of chlorophyll a fluorescence with a fluorometer. The application of diuron reduced the assimilation of CO2 in the pineapple varieties IAC Fantástico, Vitória, MD2 and Pérola, at their reproductive phase, in all CAM metabolism stages. Diuron promoted a temporary reduction of the stomatal conductance and a temporary increase in water use efficiency. The photochemical efficiency of the studied pineapple cultivars was negatively affected by the herbicide diuron, with the recovery of the initial values by cultivar IAC Fantástico.

ABSTRACT Drought stress is a limitation for the agricultural production, having as a primary effect the reduction of plant gas exchanges, and the continuity of its incidence results in a lower yield. This study aimed to evaluate the photosynthetic responses and the soybean yield, concerning the seed inoculation and foliar spray with Azospirillum brasilense and plant regulator containing auxin, gibberellin and cytokinin. A randomized complete block design was used under greenhouse conditions, with five treatments: four under drought stress (control, seed inoculation and foliar spray with A. brasilense and plant regulator) and one irrigated treatment. The soil gravimetric moisture, relative water content, CO2 net assimilation rate, apparent quantum efficiency, light compensation point and grain yield were evaluated. The water deficiency reduced the relative water content by 76.96 % and the soybean gas exchanges by 860.43 %, in the drought stress control. However, when using A. brasilense or plant regulator, the reduction of these values was mitigated, with maximum reductions of 52.40 % in the relative water content and 361.99 % in the gas exchanges. Thus, the mitigation of these effects was directly correlated with the grains yielded by plants, where the use of foliar spray with A. brasilense or plant regulator presented averages 19 % higher than the drought stress control. The applications of foliar spray with A. brasilense and plant regulator mitigate the effects of drought stress on the soybean photosynthesis and culminate in lower yield losses.

Abstract Shading is a practical measure to reduce the heat stress to grape trees in the summer. However, inappropriate shading will cause the reduction in leaf photosynthesis and consequently the retardation of growth for the plants or the loss of fruit yield and quality for the mature grape trees. In this study we have used 1-year-old ‘YinHong’ grape plants growing under different levels of shading, ranging from full sunlight 0% to 80% reduction, to investigate their growth, physiological and biochemical responses. The results show that shading rate =45% did not significantly affect grape growth. Shading over 45% reduction of the full sunlight, the growth of the grape plants were started to be inhibited. In addition, soluble protein content, the activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), transpiration rate (Tr), PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), PSII potential activity1(Fv/Fo) and photochemical quenching (qP) were decreased, whereas free proline, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, the non-photochemical quenching coefficient (qN) and the ratio of the palisade/spongy tissue were gradually increased. In particular, significant changes in plant growth, photosynthetic and the other physiological and biochemical characteristics were observed under a strong shading.

The shaft furnace knowed Midrex™ is used for the production of direct reduced iron with the use of reformed gas. Another process based on shaft reactors is the Tecnored process, which exhibits the great advantage of using self-reducing agglomerates. Therefore, it was proposed a combination of the shaft furnace for direct reduction with self-reducing pellet burden. In addition, with the aim of improving the furnace efficiency and reducing the need for reformed gas, the injection of natural gas and oxygen into the bustle region is proposed. Thus, it is possible exploit the advantages of direct reduction involving high amounts of hydrogen and faster reactions of the self-reducing process to decrease the CO2 emission, compared to that of blast furnace. The energy profile, productivity, and carbon emission of the traditional shaft furnace were compared with the simulated results after partial replacement of the burden with self-reducing pellets containing fines of elephant grass charcoal. The simulation results for a combination of 15% of self-reducing pellets in the burden with 2.5% oxygen and natural gas injection were the best among the scenarios simulated, with the productivity being 2.7 ton/m3 day and the decrease in the amount of reformed gas being 10%.

Light and soil water availability may limit carbon uptake of trees in tropical rainforests. The objective of this work was to determine how photosynthetic traits of juvenile trees respond to variations in rainfall seasonality, leaf nutrient content, and opening of the forest canopy. The correlation between leaf nutrient content and annual growth rate of saplings was also assessed. In a terra firme rainforest of the central Amazon, leaf nutrient content and gas exchange parameters were measured in five sapling tree species in the dry and rainy season of 2008. Sapling growth was measured in 2008 and 2009. Rainfall seasonality led to variations in soil water content, but it did not affect leaf gas exchange parameters. Subtle changes in the canopy opening affected CO2 saturated photosynthesis (A pot, p = 0.04). Although A pot was affected by leaf nutrient content (as follows: P > Mg > Ca > N > K), the relative growth rate of saplings correlated solely with leaf P content (r = 0.52, p = 0.003). At present, reduction in soil water content during the dry season does not seem to be strong enough to cause any effect on photosynthesis of saplings in central Amazonia. This study shows that leaf P content is positively correlated with sapling growth in the central Amazon. Therefore, the positive effect of atmospheric CO2 fertilization on long-term tree growth will depend on the ability of trees to absorb additional amount of P

Though livestock are one of the major contributors to climate change through emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), the intensity of emission and the mitigation potential from this sector is not clearly known in the study regions. Therefore, the present study was designed to estimate the emission of GHGs from the livestock sector over the time period (2003/04–2017/18) and evaluate the mitigation potential using the global livestock environment assessment model (GLEAM). Both primary and secondary data sources were used to obtain data on livestock population, herd parameters, feeding practices, and manure management. The study revealed an increasing trend of GHG from 2003/04 to 2017/18, where the annual emission increased with an average 3.8 Mt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) for all species and 3.3 Mt CO2-eq for cattle alone at national level. Though there is some variation between regions, methane (CH4) was the major gas emitted from ruminant production followed by nitrous oxide (N2O), however the emission of N2O was higher (> 70%) in poultry production. The emission intensity from chicken egg and meat, 1.8–3.3 and 2.2–7.2 kg CO2-eq/kg of product, respectively, was much lower than the emission intensity of meat from small ruminants (16.4–51.5 kg CO2-eq/kg of product) and cattle (34.2–148.2 kg CO2-eq/kg of product). Implementing the integrated mitigation approach has much pronounced reduction effect on GHG emissions as well as increasing the productivity of the livestock sector. Unless mitigation measures are taken, the sector’s emission will increase over time. Thus, federal and regional governments, and partner organizations working in the sector need to give more attention and implement the initiatives identified in the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recommendations to mitigate GHG emissions from the livestock sector.

Urban green areas, such as parks, squares, and tree-lined streets, are part of nature-based solutions (NBS) that provide ecosystem services to address these urban issues. However, there is limited knowledge about the contribution of tree species and overall ecosystem services provided by urban trees under public management, especially in Latin America. This study aimed to provide information on the contribution of urban trees in reducing highly incident pollutants, such as CO2, particulate matter (PM 2. 5 and 10), and greenhouse effect gas compounds (GEG) in the city of Lima (Peru), using the I-tree package software tool for estimating ecosystem services. The results demonstrate that urban trees under public management in Lima significantly contribute to pollutant reduction and the sequestration and storage of CO2 in the city, being that storage is nearly 50% of the levels observed in native temperate forests in Latin America and higher than the value measured in some xerophytic native forests in the same region. Other evaluated pollutantś levels are significantly reduced. Differences among tree species were observed, showing amatillo (Ficus pertusa L. f.) and red eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh.) as higher contributions to pollutant reduction, with Erythrina falcata Benth. as a native species having significant carbon storage (1,27 t/individual). This information is highly relevant for professionals and public institutions involved in urban planning and management, particularly urban tree management. It shows that tree species selection influences the mitigation of pollutant levels in cities while increasing other ecosystem services, thereby contributing to improving citizens' health.

ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to evaluate the reduction of viral replication (Colorado BoHV-1) in murine embryos after the treatment of ethanol extract of Punica granatum peel (PgEE). Swiss female mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were superovulated with 0.2 mL of the 5 UI hormones (eCG and hCG) and mated with males of the same age. After 18 hours, the females were euthanized in a CO2 chamber, and through the opening in the peritoneum, zygotes were collected and washed with 0.5% pronase solution. The zygotes were divided into four groups: G1 (control), G2 (exposed to the virus Colorado BoHV -1 to 108 TCID50/mL), G3 (exposed to PgEE) and G4 (exposed to the virus and to PgEE). The groups were maintained at 37.5ºC in TCM199 (100 mL) with 10% fetal bovine serum in an incubator at 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. After 24 h, we analyzed the cleavage rate (Fisher's exact test; p<0.05), the morphology (by light microscopy), the nested-PCR and the titration of embryos in co-culture with MDBK cells after over 72 h of treatment (Mann-Whitney test; p<0.05) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The murine embryos treated with PgEE showed satisfactory results: no morphological changes, cleavage rate similar to controls, despite the detection of the presence of virus by nested PCR and TEM, there was a decrease of the viral titer after the treatment with this extract, which suggests interference of this treatment in the viral cycle BoHV-1 Colorado without altering the embryo development.

The aim of the present study is to assess the potential of ethanol deriving from the mesocarp of babassu coconut to be used in fuel cells. Babassu ethanol was generated through hydrolysis and fermentation processes. The Pt, PtRh and PtRu electrodes were prepared in carbon Vulcan XC72R through the reduction method and applied as electrocatalysts in ethanol oxidation reaction. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), stripping CO, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) were used to characterize the synthesized eletrocatalysts. The electrocatalyst Pt80Ru20/C presented larger active area and higher catalytic activity than other studied materials. The current efficiency of CO2 production rated less than 1% in all studied electrocatalysts, thus showing that babassu ethanol oxidation produces less pollutants than the commercial ethanol.

ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to evaluate gas exchanges in seedlings of forest species grown in saline soils and subjected to soil waterlogging cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial arrangement, with four forest species: Myracrodruon urundeuva Fr Allemão, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, Tabebuia impetiginosa (Mart. ex. DC.) Standl and Azadirachta indica A. Juss, two soil salinity levels (1.2 and 8.6 dS m-1) and two water regimes (with and without waterlogging). Measurements of stomatal conductance, transpiration and CO2 assimilation rate were performed before and after each waterlogging period. The interaction of the highest saline level (8.6 dS m-1) and waterlogging caused greater reductions in leaf gas exchange, except for Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. Tabebuia impetiginosa (Mart. ex. DC.) Standl was the species with highest sensitivity to both studied factors of stress.

Acute pancreatitis is a common disease that occurs in 5—10% of patients with urgent pathology of the abdominal cavity. The most prevalent metabolic disorders affecting this group of patients are hypermetabolism and hypercatabolism syndromes, which are accompanied by excessive consumption of carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids, increased oxygen intake, and carbon dioxide production. Objective — to analyse the current state of the problem of nutritional support for patients with acute pancreatitis. The degree of nutritional disorders in patients with acute pancreatitis varies depending on the etiological factors and severity of the disease, necessitating a differential approach to their correction. Patients with acute pancreatitis experience disruption of the intestinal microflora due to the antibiotic therapy, nutrient and fiber deficiency, and lack of microbial antagonism. This disruption leads to excessive growth of bacteria, particularly gram‑negative microflora. The effectiveness and safety of enteral tube feeding are determined by a complex of factors: the timing of recovery of peristalsis and the absorption function of the intestinal wall, the type of mixture, and the method of its administration. Restoration of intestinal absorption in patients with severe acute pancreatitis occurs on average 48 hours after the start of complex conservative therapy. The use of antiflatulents as part of a mixture for enteral nutrition allows to improve the laboratory indicators of blood serum and reduce the frequency of intestinal complications on the 7th day by 21.5% (χ2=4.88, 95% CI 2.3—39.5, p=0.03). Nasogastric nutritional support in patients with severe acute pancreatitis is safe and leads to a 25.8% reduction in the incidence of local infectious complications (χ2=4.59, 95% CI 2.43—45.53, p=0.03), length of hospital stay by 16 days (p=0.04), and deaths by 21.4% (χ2=4.13, 95% CI 0.81—39.68, p=0.04) in comparison with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support should be started with nasogastric administration of a food mixture, and in case of complications (intolerance, aspiration, etc.), nasojejunal administration. Parenteral nutrition should be used if enteral nutrition is impossible or not tolerated.

In the face of pandemic-induced emergencies and unpredictable natural disasters, industries are compelled to implement rescue plans to mitigate unexpected risks. In this context, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is considered as a key metric, followed by sustainability efforts to manage unforeseen risks, encompassing social, environmental, and economic aspects. OEE is considered as a lean tool to determine the efficiency of equipment or processes on par with the world class OEE standard, i.e., 85%. Performance, Availability and Quality as three main drivers of OEE. This research study explores the implementation of OEE in conjunction with sustainability principles in an auto sector manufacturing firm, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability practices. The research involves a 12-week initial session from April to June 2022, followed by an analysis of July to September 2022, resulting in an impressive OEE value of 48%. Notable improvements in Availability (89.75%), Performance (72.68%), and Quality (73.82%) contribute significantly. The analysis reveals enhancements in scrap rework (17%), training (16%), maintenance (13%), material availability (12%), and production capability (11%). Achievements include improvements in green profile (25%), health and safety (20%), and energy efficiency (25%), along with reductions in carbon dioxide emissions (21%), waste management (17%), and scrap (15%). This research underscores the commitment of the case study industry to sustainable development and economic growth, showcasing significant enhancements in product quality and efficiency. The integration of sustainability principles into OEE initiatives is pivotal for modern industrial optimization. The study results highlight the profound significance of this synergistic relationship, particularly within the blending section, driving substantial positive outcomes in manufacturing processes and operational excellence. The implementation of sustainability efforts not only mitigates risks and fosters growth for automotive manufacturers but also yields environmental benefits. Based on findings of this study, a roadmap for automotive manufacturers is devised to achieve robust OEE while concurrently reaping economic and environmental rewards by employing sustainability principles.    

    

## Thermal Fracture Simulation in Depleted Gas Field Carbon Capture and Storage: Implications for Injectivity and Flow Assurance

Summary CO2 injection into depleted gas fields causes long-term cooling of the reservoir. Therefore, even if injection pressure stays below the fracture initiation pressure, the cooled volume still creates an extensive stress disturbance that can induce the propagation of large fractures over time. The enhanced injectivity after the onset of this thermal fracturing might jeopardize injection operations due to the risk of hydrate plugging in the injection well caused by the combination of low pressure and low temperature, and large fractures may also increase the risk of loss of containment. Modeling the fracture evolution provides an estimate of the magnitude and timing of these effects. In this study, commercial compositional reservoir simulation software capable of modeling the physical phenomena associated with CO2 injection into depleted natural gas reservoirs has been used. These encompass CO2 mixing with natural gas, water vaporization, thermal effects, and geomechanics. The finite-element geomechanics module used “two-way” coupling, which computes pressure and temperature in the flow simulation module, transmits this information to the geomechanics module to update stress and strain parameters, and uses these parameters to adjust porosity and permeability, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the overall simulation results. The thermal fracture opening is simulated as increased permeability in the fracture domain by using a fracturing criterion based on the effective stress. The fracture simulations were developed in close relation with flow assurance modeling to determine the operational windows that avoid hydrate formation while maintaining the required injection target. Unlike matrix injection, thermal fracturing shows a substantial reduction in injection bottomhole pressure (BHP), reaching 26 000 kPa (260 bar) in a specific scenario. These findings underscore the crucial consideration of cooling effects and thermal fracturing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations, particularly in flow assurance studies where well injectivity significantly influences overall outcomes. Due to the intense cooling-induced stress reduction, thermal fractures may propagate uncontrollably, potentially reaching faults within the reservoir. Temperature distributions along boundary faults may differ markedly from matrix flow conditions, highlighting the need to incorporate these effects into geomechanical studies to mitigate risks associated with fault stability during cooling processes.

Abstract: The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of the soil remineralizer fine-graded mica schist (FMS) on soybean (Glycine max) physiology, yield, and grain quality under different water regimes (WRs) in the Brazilian Cerrado. The experiment was conducted under field conditions for two years, using four WRs and three treatments: mica schist, conventional fertilization, and control. In 2017 and 2018, the following WRs were evaluated: WR1, WR2, WR3, and WR4, corresponding to a mean value of 100, 65, 44, and 28% of crop evapotranspiration replacement, respectively. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, internal CO2 concentration, effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv’/Fm’), quantum yield (PSII) (ᶲFSII), and electron transport rate reduced as a function of the advanced phenological stage of soybean and the reduction in WR. Grain quality was only affected by the WR. The mica schist was statistically similar to conventional fertilization and the control in 2017 and 2018. Yield decreased due to the anticipation of soybean phenological age and WR, but there were no differences between the three treatments in 2017 and 2018. The reduction in soybean yield is attributed to stomatal closure, loss of photoprotective capacity, and damage to the photosynthetic machinery caused by drought.

The current study uses annual time-series data from Pakistan from 1998 to 2022 to investigate the complex link between financial addition, economic inequality, and carbon emissions. The Auto-regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is used in the study to look at the dynamic correlations between variables including financial addition, income inequality, and carbon emissions. The empirical data indicates that increasing financial inclusion leads to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. In contrast, economic inequality, energy consumption, and growth have a positive correlation with CO2 emissions. These conclusions show the complicated relationship between socioeconomic determinants and environmental effects. Furthermore, the study's implications extend beyond Pakistan, giving valuable information to policymakers dealing with similar difficulties in other developing countries. This work contributes to the global discourse on sustainable growth and climate action by promoting economic addition and addressing financial disparities. It emphasizes the importance of implementing specific policy actions that promote both economic fairness and environmental sustainability. Such approaches have the potential to not only reduce carbon emissions but also encourage inclusive growth, promoting the wider aim of sustainable development in Pakistan and abroad.

This study aims to enhance multimodal transportation systems by mitigating CO2 emissions and enhancing operational efficiency. It introduces a novel centralized cargo concentration approach tailored for regions facing geographical challenges. The method proposes for direct transportation of cargo from its loading origin to export ports, bypassing intermediate hubs. The mathematical model determines the most efficient means of transport for each route, factoring in variables like distance, volume, and cargo type. Research results indicate that, in scenarios with a high concentration of cargo, multiple hubs may not be necessary, which could streamline transportation and logistics operations. Modal preferences vary based on regional dynamics and cargo characteristics, with rail and sea transport emerging as preferable options under specific circumstances, surpassing the efficacy of road transport. The proposed model showcases reductions in both logistics costs and CO2 emissions compared to road-centric scenarios. It underscores the strategic integration of diverse transportation modes as pivotal for enhancing efficiency and sustainability. This study furnishes a framework adaptable to optimizing multimodal transportation systems in regions sharing similar geographical and logistical attributes.

This paper presents a case study conducted at a food supply centre in a shopping centre in São Paulo city, Brazil. A waste digester was developed based on specifications provided by GE for the generator, and the cost of electricity production from food waste generated in the region was subsequently assessed. Results show that 1,368,750 m3 biogas was produced for the year, which provided a reduction of 14% of electricity consumption and is equivalent to USD 854 thousand per year. The amount of carbon credits is equivalent to 10,775 metric tons of CO2 and 51,840 tons of organic waste humus per year. The energy produced by biogas from food waste had a unit cost of 0.10 USD/kWh. At the end of the project, a profit of USD 3.087 million was achieved, which is equivalent to an ROI of 433%. There is a reduction in energy costs by USD 854 thousand per year and a payback of 1.01 years. These indicate that biogas production from food waste is economically viable.

To tackle the problem of severe air pollution, China has implemented active clean air policies in recent years. As a consequence, the emissions of major air pollutants have decreased and the air quality has substantially improved. Here, we quantified China’s anthropogenic emission trends from 2010–2017 and identified the major driving forces of these trends by using a combination of bottom-up emission inventory and Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) approaches. The relative change rates of China’s anthropogenic emissions during 2010–2017 are estimated as follows: −62% for SO2, −17% for NOx, +11% for NMVOC, +1% for NH3, −27% for CO, −38% for PM10, −35% for PM2.5, −27% for BC, −35% for OC, and +16% for CO2. The IDA results suggest that emission control measures are the main drivers of this reduction, in which the pollution controls on power plants and industries are the most effective mitigation measures. The emission reduction rates markedly accelerated after the year 2013, confirming the effectiveness of China’s Clean Air Action that was implemented in 2013. We estimated that during 2013–2017, China’s anthropogenic emissions decreased by 59% for SO2, 21% for NOx, 23% for CO, 36% for PM10, 33% for PM2.5, 28% for BC, and 32% for OC. NMVOC emissions increased by 11% and NH3 emissions remained stable from 2010–2017, representing the absence of effective mitigation measures for NMVOC and NH3 in current policies. The relative contributions of different sectors to emissions have significantly changed after several years’ implementation of clean air policies, indicating that it is paramount to introduce new policies to enable further emission reductions in the future.

This paper establishes a multi-objective optimization model based on an improved NSGA-II algorithm, aiming to study the carbon reduction technology path of specific enterprises in the steel industry under the background of China’s dual-carbon goal and fill the research gap in the carbon reduction technology path of steel enterprises, which has certain guiding significance for the realization of China’s dual-carbon goal and the low-carbon development of steel enterprises. Firstly, through the analysis of the list of extreme energy efficiency technologies in the steel industry and the main process flow of steel industry production, the multi-objective optimization model is constructed from the two objective dimensions of maximum CO2 emission reduction and maximum enterprise economic benefit. Then the improved NSGA-II algorithm is used to solve the model. And the empirical analysis of a Hebei iron and steel enterprise, based on the technology application of enterprises before the release of the technology list, the technology path of enterprises to reduce carbon is predicted. The actual application data of the enterprise is used for verification and analysis, and suggestions on the technical path for the future low-carbon development of the enterprise are provided. The experimental results show that: (1) The optimal solution set of Pareto is consistent with the practical application of enterprises, and the constructed model is accurate and efficient, which can be used for the research of carbon reduction technology path. (2) When introducing technology, enterprises can give priority to the solution of common set technology based on their own needs.

Metal nanoframes have gained tremendous attention in the domain of modern research and development due to their distinctive 3D spatial structure, efficient physiochemical properties, and comparatively good activity. Different strategies have been implicated by the researchers to design nanoframes of varying chemical natures and shapes. Most of the synthetic protocols being adopted to design nanoframes consist of two main steps: nucleation and the growth of solid particles and, secondly, excavation of the interiors. In this context, many synthetic methods are overviewed. To show their unprecedented performance or activity, a few applications in catalysis, biomedicine, theranostics, SERS, the sensing of different materials, the reduction of CO2, etc., are also discussed.

Abstract Developing strong sensitizing and earth-abundant antenna molecules are highly desirable for CO2 reduction through artificial photosynthesis. Herein, a library of Zn-dipyrrin complexes (Z-1−Z-6) were rationally designed via precisely controlling their molecular configuration to optimize strong sensitizing earth-abundant photosensitizers. Upon visible light excitation, their special geometry enables intramolecular charge transfer to induce charge transfer state, which was firstly demonstrated to accept electrons from electron donor. The resulting long-lived reduced photosensitizer was confirmed to trigger consecutive intermolecular electron transfers for boosting CO2-to-CO conversion. Remarkably, the earth-abundant catalytic system with Z-6 and Fe-catalyst exhibits outstanding performance with over 20 000 turnover number and 29.7% quantum yield, representing an excellent catalytic performance among the molecular catalytic systems, and much superior to that of noble-metal photosensitizer Ir(ppy)2(bpy)+ under the similar condition. Experimental and theoretical investigations comprehensively unveil the structure-activity relationship, opening up a new horizon to develop earth-abundant strong sensitizing chromophores for boosting artificial photosynthesis.

MgAl2O4 spinel employed as support of reforming catalysts was doped by CeO2. The samples were prepared by wet impregnation from aqueous solutions of cerium nitrate, with and without chelating agents. The chelating agents used were ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and citric acid (CA) at different pH of impregnation. The solids were characterized by TG, XRD, SBET, TPR, SEM-EDX and CO2-TPD. Nanoparticles of CeO2 between 5 and 6.8 nm were obtained by the thermal decomposition in air at 600 °C. The surface cerium reduction occurred in a wide temperature range of 450° to 670 °C. The use of citric acid at pH= 8 led to the lowest crystallite size of CeO2 and the lowest interaction with the spinel. The H2 consumption and extent of CeO2-support interaction did not show a clear dependence with the CeO2 crystallite sizes. The use of chelating agents in the impregnation step did not modify the total basicity. Slight changes in the strength of weak basic sites were observed.

A precise management framework is the first step towards multi-factor relationship optimization and environmental benefit maximization. However, refinery-chemical integration faces incongruity between increasing production demand and pollution mitigation owing to multi-factor interconnectedness and incomplete impact evaluation. The material and energy characteristics of the petrochemicals were considered to establish an integrated analysis framework using material-energy-coupled carbon flow tracking and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the entire process. Coupled analysis revealed that the refinery and chemical blocks accounted for 84.1 % and 15.9 % of the carbon flow, respectively, with a total carbon transformation of 73,667.1 kt carbon equivalent (C eq). Notably, multi-level carbon emission factors were calculated aligning with the proportion of carbon metabolism as the weight, among which the refinery-chemical integration reached 0.11 t CO2 equivalent (CO2 eq)/t scale. The LCA results indicated that the overall environmental contribution of the refinery block was considerably greater than that of the chemical block (82.82 % vs. 17.18 %), in which the major contributors were crude oil and ethylene, respectively. On this basis, an optimized scheme for waste resource recycling was proposed by converting petroleum coke to synthesis gas, which reduced the damage value by 2,484.0 MPt compared with the original process. This study provided a theoretical foundation for the precise management and practical support for the collaborative optimization of pollution and carbon emission reduction in the petrochemical industry.

Balancing burgeoning energy demands in the electricity sector while curbing carbon emissions poses a formidable challenge for emerging economies like Bangladesh, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Despite the country's power system master plan (PSMP) until 2041 and submitted intended nationally determined contributions (INDC) to tackle mounting energy needs and associated emissions, the PSMP lacks specific emission reduction strategies. Thus, this study employs carbon emission pinch analysis to facilitate Bangladesh's long-term energy planning, highlighting emission reduction hurdles. This research aims to set emission limits, delineate fossil fuel and carbon-neutral source (i.e., zero emission during operation) compositions, ascertain carbon-neutral source ranges for targeted emissions, and propose viable carbon-neutral sources to meet escalating energy demands. Three scenarios are extensively explored: fulfilling INDC mandates, a 10% increase in renewable energy, and maintaining 2035 emission levels in 2040. The analysis unveils emission limits of 55 758.83 and 84 778.61 × 109 grams of CO2 equivalent for 2025 and 2030, respectively. Projections indicate a foreseen 10% surge in renewable energy by 2035, elevating its share to 18.16%. Carbon-neutral energy sources, encompassing solar, wind, hydroelectricity, biomass, and nuclear, are estimated to cover 56.06% of energy demand by 2040, driving a 33.30% emissions reduction.

Emissions originating from inland navigation should be reduced to achieve climate targets. This paper aims to identify (1) onboard GHG emission measurement systems, (2) calculation methods for GHG emissions of inland vessels and (3) reduction measures. A systematic literature review, examining 6 databases, yielded 105 initial outcomes, with 17 relevant references. The review reveals a scarcity of studies, with the majority concentrated in Europe and Asia, while North America, Africa, Australia, and South America remain largely unexplored. Four of the seventeen relevant studies focused on real-world GHG emissions measurement. Future research should explore more efficient and calibrated approaches for real-time CO2 insights in inland vessels. In the section on calculating GHG emissions, most papers attempt to adapt the EEDI or EEXI to inland navigation. Reduction measures for GHG emissions concentrate on alternative fuels, like LNG, methanol, hydrogen, or alternative power sources. As the research in this area is limited, prioritizing it in academic discourse is not only essential for advancing our understanding but also imperative for shaping a resilient and environmentally conscious future for inland navigation.

Phycoremediation is a term of treating microalgae with waste water to reduce thetoxic elements in it. Textile dye industrial effluents contain highly concentrated CO2 andNitrogen in it, which causes severe harmful effects to human and to the environment. Thereduction of Physiochemical parameters were seen from before and after treated effluents.Biochemical analysis from the microalgae biomass reveals that Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorellavulgaris and its consortium have shown high amount of Protein and Lipid in ascending order.Microalgae pigments such as chlorophyll a, b and â-carotene were determined and â-carotenefound high amount than chlorophyll from all the treated biomass as expected but high thannormal grown media. Scenedesmus obliquus is found to be the highest producer of â-carotene.Positive and negative correlation were analysed between removal of nitrogen from the effluentand increase in protein content and removal of COD from the effluent and high lipid content(Positive) and Increase in Lipid content leads to decrease in â-carotene levels (Negative).

ABSTRACT Water deficit is most frequent in forest physiognomies subjected to climate change. As a consequence, several tree species alter tissue water potential, gas exchange and production of carbon compounds to overcome damage caused by water deficiency. The working hypothesis, that a reduction in gas exchange by plants experiencing water deficit will affect the composition of carbon compounds in soluble sugars, lipids and vegetative structures, was tested on Copaifera langsdorffii. Stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, and CO2 assimilation rate declined after a period of water deficit. After rehydration, leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange did not recover completely. Water deficit resulted in 13C enrichment in leaves, soluble sugars and root lipids. Furthermore, the amount of soluble sugars and root lipids decreased after water deficit. In rehydration, the carbon isotopic composition and amount of root lipids returned to levels similar to the control. Under water deficit, 13C-enriched in root lipids assists in the adjustment of cellular membrane turgidity and avoids damage to the process of water absorption by roots.

In this study, vermiculite was explored as a support material for nickel catalysts in two key processes in syngas production through dry reforming of methane with CO2 and steam reforming of ethanol. The vermiculite was subjected to acid or base treatment, then, Ni catalysts were prepared through incipient wetness impregnation and characterized using various techniques, including X-ray, FTIR, temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). TG-TD analyses were performed to assess the formation of carbon deposits on spent catalysts. The Ni based catalysts were used in the reaction tests without a reduction pre-treatment. Initially, raw vermiculite-supported nickel showed limited catalytic activity, however after acid (Ni/VTA) or base (Ni/VTB) treatment, vermiculite became an effective support for nickel in dry methane reforming. The resulting catalysts (Ni/VTB and Ni/VTA) displayed outstanding performance, with high methane conversion and hydrogen yield. Acidic treatment improved the reduction of nickel species and reduced carbon deposition, outperforming alkali treatment. The prepared catalysts were also explored in ethanol steam reforming. The performance was investigated as a function of the temperature, water/ethanol ratio, and space velocity, with acid-treated catalysts performing as the best. The study emphasized the importance of contact time with the catalyst and addressed challenges related to carbon formation and sintering for long-term stability. In conclusion, acidic treatment of the vermiculite support, before Ni deposition, significantly enhanced the catalytic activity and stability of nickel catalysts in both dry methane reforming and ethanol steam reforming processes.

ABSTRACT Water deficit is most frequent in forest physiognomies subjected to climate change. As a consequence, several tree species alter tissue water potential, gas exchange and production of carbon compounds to overcome damage caused by water deficiency. The working hypothesis, that a reduction in gas exchange by plants experiencing water deficit will affect the composition of carbon compounds in soluble sugars, lipids and vegetative structures, was tested on Copaifera langsdorffii. Stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, and CO2 assimilation rate declined after a period of water deficit. After rehydration, leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange did not recover completely. Water deficit resulted in 13C enrichment in leaves, soluble sugars and root lipids. Furthermore, the amount of soluble sugars and root lipids decreased after water deficit. In rehydration, the carbon isotopic composition and amount of root lipids returned to levels similar to the control. Under water deficit, 13C-enriched in root lipids assists in the adjustment of cellular membrane turgidity and avoids damage to the process of water absorption by roots. These physiological adjustments permit a better understanding of the responses of Copaifera langsdorffi to water deficit.

Abstract The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of different calcium chloride concentrations on the post-harvest conservation of jabuticaba variety Pingo de Mel at different storage temperatures. The fruit were collected 30 days after the anthesis and subjected to immersions in calcium chloride solution at different concentrations (0%, 2%, 4%, and 6%) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then, the fruit were dried and packed in polypropylene bags and incubated in a chamber at different temperatures (6 °C, 12 °C, and 25 °C). Samples were analyzed at time 0 and every two days, up to 12 days of storage. No effect of different calcium chloride concentrations was observed in the fruit characteristics at different storage temperatures over time. During storage, an increase of soluble and total pectin contents, antioxidant activity, CO2, total sugars, acidity, and weight loss was observed. Higher storage temperatures affected both the increase in weight loss, pH, and O2 production and the reduction of vitamin C content. Refrigeration was important for the post-harvest conservation of jabuticaba variety Pingo de Mel , once the fruit stored at 6 °C suffered minor variations with improvements or little changes during the 12 days.

ABSTRACT The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide on the emergence, growth and gas exchange of yellow passion fruit seedlings subjected to salt stress. The experiment was conducted in pots (Citropote®) under greenhouse conditions, in the municipality of Campina Grande, PB, Brazil. Treatments were distributed in a randomized block design, in a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement, with four levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (0.7, 1.4, 2.1 and 2.8 dS m-1) associated with four concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0, 25, 50 and 75 μM), with four replicates and two plants per plot. Irrigation using water with electrical conductivity above 0.7 dS m-1 negatively affects the emergence and growth of passion fruit. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations between 10 and 30 μM induce the acclimation of passion fruit plants to salt stress, mitigating the deleterious effects of salinity on the relative growth rate in stem diameter and leaf area, stomatal conductance, transpiration, CO2 assimilation rate and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency. Irrigation water salinity combined with hydrogen peroxide concentrations above 30 μM causes reduction in passion fruit growth and physiology.

The intricate structure and surface properties of metal oxide catalysts pose a challenge for implementing hydrophobic surface treatment. Herein, the surface of CuAl2O4 catalysts is modified by means of grafting and bridging different saturated fatty acid molecules, including lauric acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid. Consequently, the modification leads to an enhancement in the hydrophobicity of the catalyst, as evidenced by an increase in the static water contact angle from 15.26° to 150.74°. The hydrophobization of CuAl2O4 catalysts, in turn, influences the decomposition and reduction capacity of CuAl2O4, thus favoring the formation of a more stable defective spinel structure and improving the dispersion of Cu particles, thereby restraining aggregation. Notably, the activity results indicate that the hydrophobically modified CuAl2O4 exhibits higher CO conversion and selectivity of dimethyl ether, while effectively suppressing the water–gas shift reaction and reducing CO2 selectivity. This observation points to the significance of the catalyst surface hydrophobicity in enhancing catalytic performance

In order to overcome the limitations of traditional clean energy utilization methods, this paper proposed an innovative technical solution for a combined heating system that cleverly integrated solar, wind, and geothermal energy to achieve complementarity and synergized among them, thereby ensuring stable and efficient energy utilization. First, a comprehensive mathematical model was developed for the entire heating system, encompassing solar thermal subsystem, geothermal subsystem, wind power generation subsystem, and a second-stage reheating subsystem. Subsequently, Ebsilon simulation software was utilized to cleverly couple these subsystems together, with corresponding boundary conditions set to ensure the overall efficiency and stability of the system. Based on meteorological data and geothermal resource parameters from a typical heating season in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China, this paper thoroughly analyzed the variations in key performance indicators such as the photothermal conversion efficiency of solar thermal subsystem and the heating capacity of geothermal subsystem. This provided valuable insight for optimizing the design of heating system. The results indicated that during the daylight hours of the heating season, both the photothermal conversion efficiency and the heat supply from the solar thermal subsystem exhibited an increasing trend as solar radiation increased. Among them, the photothermal conversion efficiency peaked at 76.013%, while the maximum heat supply output reached 40.311 kW. When solar direct radiation was relatively weak, the system primarily relied on the heat release process of the thermal storage tank to maintain heating, with a minimum heat supply of 27.268 kW. During nighttime hours of the heating season, the geothermal subsystem dominated the heating process, with a maximum heat supply of 125.556 kW. Additionally, for every 5 °C increased in geothermal water temperature, the heat supply from the geothermal subsystem increased by an average of 6.553 kW, demonstrating excellent heating response performance. Therefore, the integrated clean heating system that combines solar, geothermal, and wind energy not only significantly improves the utilization efficiency of clean energy but also enhances the heating stability of the integrated clean energy coupling system to a certain extent. The clean heating technical solution proposed in the paper had a theoretical total heating capacity of 19 680 kW during the heating season. When converted, this equates to a substitution of 6.9 tons of standard coal, resulting in a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 17.94 tons. This demonstrates the considerable cleanliness and environmental benefits of the proposed heating system. This study provides a valuable reference for the engineering application of renewable energy in the field of clean heating.

Abstract The flotation process currently considered for apatite concentration from the Santa Quitéria phosphate deposit (Brazil), involves bulk flotation of apatite and calcite with anionic collector at pH=10 followed by calcite flotation at pH=5.5, adjusted with H3PO4. Although this concept is efficient from the point of view of separation between apatite and calcite, the intensive use of inorganic acids causes ion accumulation in the process water, especially Ca2+ and PO4 2-, which leads to problems in the flotation stage as well as in the environment. CETEM has been studying a process for the separation of carbonate minerals and apatite that involves the use of carbonic gas injected into the bubble generation system of flotation machines instead of inorganic acids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Ca2+ ion concentration on the water during the calcite flotation stage of the Santa Quiteria phosphate ore, between 6 mg/L (standard test) and 670 mg/L (maximun concentration) on the flotation performance in terms of P2O5 grade and its loss and the CaO/P2O5 ratio (RCP). The results indicated a reduction in the selectivity on the flotation of calcite from apatite for Ca2+ concentrations from 6 mg/L to around 285 mg/L. Despite this, the results obtained in this study indicated that the process based on the application of CO2 for the separation of calcite and apatite may be a technical alternative that causes less impact in flotation performance for the phosphate concentration ores with carbonated gangue.

Asymmetric coordination effect is an important concept in heterogeneous catalysis where both catalytic activity and product selectivity are serious influenced. However, this effect has rarely been understood because of the difficult in characterizing detailed coordination information. Here, by employing a theoretical study on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) towards HCOOH over Ti3C2O2-based NS/NN co-coordinated transition metal single atom catalysts (TM-NS/NN-Ti3C2O2 SACs), we show that asymmetric coordination environments have great impact on the electronic structure of the active center. Both electron transferring ability and spin polarization of the active center are vital to optimize the adsorption and hydrogenation of key intermediates. As a result, both catalytic activity and product selectivity can be maximized. V-NN-Ti3C2O2 are predicted to promote high-throughput HCOOH generation process at operation applied potential of −0.32 with considerable electrochemical stability, surpassing most reported catalysts. This work demonstrates V-NN-Ti3C2O2 as high-performance ECO2RR catalysts, and highlights that the introduction of the concept of asymmetric coordination effect may offer a new insight into the rational design of more efficient SACs.

ABSTRACT The effects of soil compaction on crop growth and productivity have been well studied in recent years, however, studies on the physiological responses of crops to compaction are scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil compaction on gas exchange, and photochemical efficiency of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) genotypes of different growth habits. The experimental design was a randomized block in a 3×4 factorial arrangement, with three lima bean genotypes (Branca-Pequena, Orelha-de-Vó and Roxinha) and four compaction levels (soil densities of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7 g cm-3), with four replications. The following variables were evaluated at 38 days after sowing: photosynthetic rate (A), leaf transpiration (E), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO2 concentration (Ci), instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE), intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE), instantaneous carboxylation efficiency (iCE) and photochemical efficiency (Fo, Fm, Fv and Fv/Fm). The data were subjected to analysis of variance at 5% probability by the F test. The genotypes showed a reduction in the photosynthetic rate with increasing soil compaction. The soil compaction affected the photochemical efficiency of the genotype Orelha-de-Vó, with the Fm and Fv fitting to the linear model, and the Fv/Fm fitting to the quadratic model. The genotype Orelha-de-Vó had the highest rate of E and gs at the soil densities of 1.24 and 1.29 g cm-3, respectively. Regarding the photosynthetic rate, the genotype Roxinha is more efficient than Branca-Pequena at the soil density of 1.7 g cm -3.    

    

## Using a systems biology approach to describe the role of dissimilatory phosphite oxidation in the global phosphorus cycle

Overview. We investigated the role of redox reactions in the global phosphorous (P) cycle. We identified novel microbial processes responsible for oxidation of reduced phosphorous in the form of phosphite producing bioavailable phosphate. We identified central tenets that define microbial dissimilatory phosphite oxidation (DPO) and the breadth of the taxonomy of DPO microorganisms (DPOM). We demonstrated that this metabolism is vertically evolved from 3.8 GYA contemporaneously with anoxygenic phototrophy. We further demonstrate its occurrence on extant Earth as a primary mechanism driving a phosphorous redox cycle. Finally, we showed that this metabolism is environmentally maintained by the newly described autotrophic Phosphitivorax genus which rely on the reductive glycine pathway for carbon fixation. Our results demonstrate that these species are involved in a complex nutrient-dependent symbiotic relationship with their community in which they provide the fixed carbon to support the heterotrophic community and in return receive prerequisite corrinoids to maintain their activities. Intellectual Merit. P is essential for life and predominantly exists on Earth as oxidized phosphate (PO43-; P valence +5). Given the finite quantities of natural P, current unsustainable agriculture practices are predicted to deplete terrestrial reserves within ~200 years. P is critical to modern biochemical functions and can control ecosystem growth. It was presumably also important as a reagent in prebiotic chemistry. On Earth's early surface P would have been present as a mixture of PO43- minerals, as a minor element in silicate minerals, and in reactive, reduced phases from accreted dust, meteorites, and asteroids. These sources would have weathered and plausibly furnished prebiotic Earth with abundant and potentially reactive P. The evolution of life at some point forged a P-limited biosphere, with evolutionary stress forcing the efficient extraction and recycling of P from both abiotic and biotic sources and sinks. Current P cycle models typically focus on bulk content and transport and P conversion between mineral-bound, organic, and ionic states. These models consistently overlook alternative P redox states although reduced species have been identified in diverse environments and frequently serve as a biological P source when soluble orthophosphate is limited. Phosphite (HPO32-; P valence +3), a highly soluble, geochemically stable compound, can account for up to 30% of total dissolved P in various environments. While studies suggest that life evolution may have been dependent on HPO32-, recent findings indicate an active redox cycle between PO43- and HPO32- on contemporary Earth. Currently, the extent of this cycle and its underlying processes are unknown although they impact P solubility and bioavailability. While mechanisms of PO43- reduction to HPO32- remain obscure, microbial activity is likely the principal means of HPO32- oxidation. Recently, DPO has been described in which microorganisms use HPO32- as an energy source through a largely uncharacterized metabolism. DPO may play a particularly important role in HPO32- oxidation due to the substantially higher rates and quantities of PO43- produced with this metabolism compared to biological HPO32- assimilation. Our studies demonstrate that DPO is environmentally prevalent and appears dependent on CO2 metabolism. The studies also highlighted the biochemical specialization and ancient origins of DPOM. An intricate web of nutrient sharing between DPOM and non-DPO community members is also apparent but poorly understood, putatively involving novel products of carbon fixation and corrinoids. If predictions of DPO prevalence are true, these autotrophs could serve as a key driver of primary production potentially accounting for 0.95Gt of CO2, or ~2.6% of global CO2 emissions from 2021 (36.3 Gt). Project overview. This interdisciplinary project combined geological and geochemical studies with systems biology approaches to elucidate the prevalence and constraints on P redox cycling. We investigated the natural occurrence and abundance of HPO32- in different geological settings. As part of these studies, we will investigated DPO in a broad range of environments. We uncovered the complex network of nutrient exchange and identify the existence of novel carbon reduction product(s) of this lithoautotrophic metabolism capable of sustaining heterotrophic community members as primary producers. We expect this work to shed light on how redox cycling affects the global phosphorus cycle and its integration with the carbon cycle. Broader Impacts. These studies will expand our understanding of phosphorous redox cycling in the global P cycle and its integration with the carbon cycle because DPO could additionally play an important, and heretofore unrecognized role in primary production. The importance of this work is heightened by the fact that P is an essential limiting nutrient in biological and agricultural systems and is timely given current global pressures to identify novel carbon sinks and bioavailable P resources.

The oxidation of heavy oil (HOO) during In-situ combustion (ISC) within the porous media of reservoir rock matrix is a critical process. Although previous research has individually investigated the catalytic capabilities of clay minerals (e.g., kaolinite) and carbonate minerals (e.g., dolomite) in HOO, their combined influence remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate the impact of dolomite and kaolinite coexistence on HOO in the Badaowan Formation reservoir located in the Karamay Oilfield. The findings reveal that the Hongqian (HQ) core displays remarkable catalytic ability for HOO, evidenced by the reduction in peak temperatures (Tpeak) of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infrared absorption of H2O and CO2 during heavy oil HTO stage. The enhanced catalytic ability is not solely attributed to the presence of single-component minerals like quartz, feldspar, dolomite, or kaolinite within the HQ core. Instead, the kaolinite/dolomite composite showcased a synergistic effect, significantly lowering the Tpeak of DSC (HTO) beyond the performance of kaolinite or dolomite acting independently. This synergistic effect is closely associated with the dehydroxylation process of kaolinite. Notably, the catalytic effect of the kaolinite/dolomite composite on HOO was further enhanced at calcination temperatures above 450 °C, primarily due to the increased catalytic ability of dolomite after calcination.

ABSTRACT The salinity of irrigation water or soil is the abiotic factor that most negatively impacts the yield of crops, including green maize, so it is necessary to find alternatives to ensure production. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, and growth of maize under salinity of irrigation water and application of hydrogen peroxide. The experiment was conducted at the Center of Sciences and Agrifood Technology, Pombal, PB, belonging to the Federal University of Campina Grande, in the period from January to February 2015, using the maize hybrid ‘AG 1051’. The treatments consisted of two salinity levels of irrigation water (0.3 and 2.0 dS m-1) and five concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0, 40, 80, 160, and 320 µmol L-1) applied via irrigation water. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme, with four replicates. ECw of 2.0 dS m-1 reduces transpiration, stomatal conductance, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, and initial growth, but does not affect the dry mass accumulation of maize plants. Application of H2O2 via soil varying from 0 to 320 µmol L-1 causes reductions in the CO2 assimilation rate and transpiration, as well as at concentrations from 0 to 160 µmol L-1 for stomatal conductance of plants irrigated with ECw of 2.0 dS m-1. Application of H2O2 via soil up to a concentration of 320 µmol L-1 increases the plant height, but reduces culm diameter of maize.

Sperm capacitation involves biochemical and physiological changes that enable sperm to fertilize the oocyte. It can be induced in vitro under controlled conditions that simulate the environment of the oviduct. While extensively studied in mammals, its approach in lizards remains absent. Understanding the mechanisms that facilitate reproduction is essential for advancing the implementation of assisted reproductive technologies in this group. Fifteen males of Sceloporus torquatus were collected during the early stage of the reproductive season. The sperm were isolated from the seminal plasma and then diluted up to a volume of 150 μl using BWW medium to incubate with 5% CO2 at 30 °C for a maximum duration of 3 hours. A fraction was retrieved hourly for ongoing sperm assessment. We found that total motility is maintained up to 2 hours post-incubation, after which it decreased. However, sperm viability remained constant. From that moment on, we observed a transition to a deeper and less symmetrical flagellar bending in many spermatozoa. The chlortetracycline assay indicated a reduction in the percentage of sperm showing the F pattern and an increase in those exhibiting the capacitated (B) and reactive (RA) patterns, accompanied by an elevation in the percentage of damaged acrosomes as revealed by the lectin binding assay. In mammals, these changes are often associated with sperm capacitation. These observations support the notion that this process may also occur in saurian.

Stabilization of central carbohydrate metabolism plays a key role in plant stress response. Carbohydrates are substrate for numerous metabolic and stress-responsive reactions and have been shown to be involved in diverse signalling processes on a whole plant level. Regulation of enzymatic sucrose synthesis and degradation is well-known to be central to many stress-related processes as it significantly impacts stress tolerance. Leaf sucrose metabolism involves sucrose cleavage by invertases and ATP-consuming re-synthesis catalysed by hexokinase and sucrose phosphate synthase. These reactions establish a metabolic cycle. To study the physiological role of sucrose cycling, a kinetic model was developed to simulate dynamics of subcellular sugar concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana under combined cold and high light stress. Model simulation revealed that subcellular reprogramming of invertase-driven sucrose cleavage varies substantially between natural accessions of Arabidopsis which differ in their cold tolerance levels. A stress-induced shift of sucrose cleavage from the cytosol into the vacuole could only be observed for the tolerant accession while the susceptible accession increased the cytosolic proportion of sucrose cleavage. Under stress, reduction of vacuolar invertase activity significantly affected maximum quantum yield of photosystem II and CO2 assimilation rates. While wild type plants circumvented a limitation of sucrose cleavage by increasing vacuolar invertase activity, mutant plants were not able to compensate their deficiency of vacuolar by cytosolic activity. Consequently, the capacity for cytosolic hexose generation was lower than for enzymatic hexose phosphorylation suggesting a role of vacuolar invertase activity in preventing a limitation in cytosolic hexose metabolism under stress.

This study focuses on solving rural problems, sustaining environmental conditions, pastures improvement, and reduction of CO2 concentration, suggesting inoculated vegetation types found in the tropics as a nature-based solution for degraded agroecosystems. Noninoculated plants are intensively used for revegetation of degraded and mined lands, AMF taxonomic and plant-fungal ecological studies. Among those grasses, Urochloa brizantha is a tropical forage, having vigorous deep roots, commonly used for arbuscular mycorrhizae (AMF) multiplication in glasshouse and nursery, developing infective propagules to be conserved in germplasm banks. Other grass species, such as Urochloa decumbens, is also used for arbuscular mycorrhizal multiplication in addition to its cultivation for guaranteeing the sustainable of livestock systems. In the present study, a site of 100 m2 was selected to take soil samples in a plain area, with U. brizantha pasture, and the soil chemical characterization, microcharcoal content and AMF spore identification, were evaluated 3+6showing high amount of potassium (K), high microcharcoal content and the occurrence of 11.32 spores of AMF, most of Glomeraceae, in the rhizosphere of U. brizantha. Due to its economic importance for sustainable agricultural production and other uses besides its environmental services, as important promoters of soil carbon on grazing lands, more detailed research is needed on the biotic interactions and inoculant production in of the studied grasses.

One of the most important challenges for the South East Europe region will be replacing more than 30% of its presently installed fossil fuel generation capacity by the end of 2030, and more than 95% by 2050 if its age structure is considered. This requires a strong policy framework to incentivise new investments in a region currently lacking investors, but also presents an opportunity to shape the electricity sector over the long term according to the broader energy transition strategy of the EU and the Energy Community. The aim of this paper is to assess what type of long-term pathways exist for electricity sector development in the region if they follow the energy transition process of the EU. In this model-based scenario assessment, long term electricity sector futures are explored using a set of interlinked electricity models evaluating the level of renewable energy investment required in the region to reach a deep decarbonization target, assuming emission reduction above 94% by 2050 compared to 1990 in line with the long term market integration and climate policy goals of the EU. It also explores what are the most important system wide impacts of the high deployment of renewable energy concerning generation adequacy and security of supply. Key policy insightsEnergy policies in the South East Europe (SEE) region, both at the national and regional level, should focus on enabling renewable energy integration, as this will be a key component of the future energy mix.EU and Energy Community policies should be incorporated into national energy planning to ensure that SEE countries embark on the energy transition process at an early stage.Stranded costs should be carefully considered in decision-making on new fossil-fuel generation and gas network investment in order to avoid lock-in to carbon intensive technologies.If consistent decarbonization policy prevails, with a significant and persistent CO2 price signal, the role of natural gas remains transitory in the region.The SEE region offers relatively cheap decarbonization options: the power sector can reduce GHG emissions above 94% by 2050 in the modelled scenarios.

The performance of nano-zero-valent iron for heavy metal remediation can be enhanced via incorporation into bimetallic carbon composites. However, few economical and green approaches are available for preparing bimetallic composite materials. In this study, novel Co/Fe bimetallic biochar composites (BC@Co/Fe-X, where X = 5 or 10 represents the CoCl2 concentration of 0.05 or 0.1 mol L−1) were prepared for the adsorption of Pb2+. The effect of the concentration of cross-linked metal ions on Pb2+ adsorption was investigated, with the composite prepared using 0.05 mol L−1 Co2+ (BC@Co/Fe-5) exhibiting the highest adsorption performance. Various factors, including the adsorption period, Pb2+ concentration, and pH, affected the adsorption of Pb2+ by BC@Co/Fe-5. Further characterisation of BC@Co/Fe-5 before and after Pb2+ adsorption using methods such as X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that the Pb2+ adsorption mechanism involved (i) Pb2+ reduction to Pb0 by Co/Fe, (ii) Co/Fe corrosion to generate Fe2+ and fix Pb2+ in the form of PbO, and (iii) Pb2+ adsorption by Co/Fe biochar. Notably, BC@Co/Fe-5 exhibited excellent remediation performance in simulated Pb2+-contaminated water and soil with good recyclability.

Abstract C-C coupling is important in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for production of green chemicals. However, understanding of the underlying coupling mechanism(s) is poor because of the complexity of the reaction network. Here, we report a method to establish the structure-activity relationship in C-C coupling reactions via statistical analyses on a big dataset. The dataset contains a total of 45,738 adsorption data, which are generated through a combination of quantum chemical computations and machine-learning and encompasses 378 active site structures formed by 27 transition metals together with 6 potential coupling precursors. Analyses of these data establishes that, 1) asymmetric coupling mechanisms exhibit potential for greater efficiency compared with symmetric coupling, agreeing well with reported experiment, and 2) C-C coupling selectivity of Cu-based catalysts can be boosted through bimetallic doping. The three-component combination of CuAgNb exhibited superior coupling selectivity compared with both Cu and CuAg catalysts. Importantly, we experimentally substantiate the CuAgNb catalyst selected based on data screening, to demonstrate actual boosted performance in C-C coupling. We conclude that this finding evidences practicality of our theoretical model, and that combining big data with complex catalytic reaction mechanisms will become a basis or a new paradigm for accelerating optimal catalyst design for multi-carbon chemicals production.

Differentially dolomitized carbonate strata in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) are increasingly targeted for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), yet few studies have evaluated the petrophysical characteristics of these conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs for this purpose. To address this, this study uses drill core analysis (sedimentology, diagenesis, pore morphology and distribution), together with core plug and production data, to evaluate the properties of five depleted oil and gas fields in the Middle to Upper Devonian Swan Hills Formation, Leduc Formation and Wabamun Group. The Swan Hills and Leduc Formations are comprised of reef, shoal and lagoon deposits that are predominantly fossil-rich (e.g. stromatoporoid-dominated rudstones and boundstones). In contrast, the carbonate ramp deposits of the Wabamun Group are fossil-poor, consisting instead of variably bioturbated carbonate mudstones, wackestones and packstones. Replacement dolomitization is variable throughout each stratigraphic unit, but generally occurs within fossil-rich and/or heavily bioturbated intervals. Fracture densities are broadly comparable in limestone and dolostone. Porosity in the Swan Hills and Leduc Formations is predominantly moldic and vuggy, occurring where fossils (e.g. stromatoporoids) are partially or fully dissolved. Pore space in the Wabamun Group is mostly restricted to intercrystalline porosity within burrows. In general, burial cements (e.g. calcite and dolomite) are volumetrically insignificant and only partially fill pores. Exceptions to this include porosity-occluding cements associated w ith fractures and breccias in the vicinity of faults. Dolomitization and depositional facies are found to exert a strong control on pore morphology, distribution and interconnectivity. Porosity is primarily controlled by the relative abundance of skeletal grains and by the presence of burrows. These highly porous facies acted as fluid pathways during burial diagenesis, resulting in their preferential dolomitization, solution enhancement of pre-existing pores, and creation of volume reduction-related porosity. The high CO2 storage capacity and low unplanned plume migration risk (due to depositional/diagenetic baffles) of dolomitized reefal reservoirs (e.g. Swan Hills and Leduc Formations) make them more attractive targets for CCUS than those with limited capacity and/or potential migration pathways (e.g. fault-related fractures and breccias in the Wabamun Group). These results demonstrate that drill core analysis, in combination with legacy data, can provide valuable insights into the factors that control reservoir CO2 injectivity, plume migration and storage capacity.

Coffee beans are a major agricultural product and coffee is one of the most widely traded commodities and consumed beverages globally. Supply chains and cropping systems are very diverse, with contrasted potentials and performance, as well as environmental impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies are needed to inform on reduction in impacts, but there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the variability of existing LCA results and impacts of the cropping systems and their trade-offs along the supply chains. In an attempt to address this knowledge gap, the paper presents a systematic literature review of coffee LCA, considering a total of 34 studies covering 234 coffee systems. Global warming potential (GWP) was the impact category most reported in the literature, but the results varied greatly at both the farm and drink levels. For the former, the GWP was in the range of 0.15–14.5 (median 3.6) kg CO2 eq./kg green coffee beans and for the latter the values ranged from 2 to 23 (median of 8.8) kg CO2 eq./kg consumed coffee in drinks. Main contributors to the GWP of production of green coffee beans were land use change (LUC), fertilisers and wet processing. However, there were great inconsistencies across studies in terms of LUC accounting, field emissions and wet process modelling. Green coffee beans production was also the main contributor to the GWP of coffee consumed, followed by brewing and coffee cup washing. Some studies covered other impacts, in addition to GWP. At both the farm and drink levels, fertilisers and pesticides were the main contributors to eutrophication and acidification, and to ecotoxicity, respectively. Brewing was the second main contributor at the drink level, in some cases the top contributor for energy-related indicators. Assumptions on packaging, cup washing and waste disposal were highly variable across studies. Water impact indicators were hardly comparable due to the system variability and method inconsistencies. Given the large diversity of coffee cropping systems worldwide, but also the diversity of possible coffee drinks, we recommend that LCA studies be standardised with respect to the definition of the functional unit, including consistent quality aspects for both green coffee beans (moisture) and coffee drinks (organoleptic properties). They should also be more thorough in detailing processes at all stages. More attention should be paid to the farming system complexity and a mass balance should be ensured when assessing biomass flows concerning LUC, co-products and residue emissions. Finally, more primary data would be needed to decipher the cropping system diversity, as well as to characterise emissions from all inputs to the field and bean processing, notably for wet and semi-wet processing.

With concrete's key role in construction and infrastructure, the reduction of its carbon footprint is critical for addressing global carbon emissions. One strategy to reduce environmental impact from concrete production is to replace cement clinker or fine aggregates in concrete with industrial wastes. Mine tailings, being a high-volume under-utilized resource, possess properties making it suitable for use as a partial substitute for cement or fine aggregates. This review article provides an overview of the recent findings within the topic of tailings-based concrete (TBC). Many of the identified publications aimed to describe the mechanical performance of TBC, and to optimize the concrete mix with respect to the strength and durability. The recommended cement replacement ranged from 5–25% and the recommended fine aggregate replacement ranged from 20–60%. In general, the compressive strength was decreased with increasing use of tailings as a replacement of cement. For the use of tailings as replacement for fine aggregates, the correlation was more complex, normally the mechanical performance enhanced at low replacement levels, until it reached an optimum after which it decreased. CO2 savings for replacing fine aggregate with tailings were up to 12% and for the cement replacement up to 30%. When assessing the environmental performance, most of the publications did not account for the loss of its mechanical performance, which could lead to the risk of underestimating the environmental impact. This review not only provides a basis for understanding the mechanical, toxicological, and environmental performances of TBCs, but also links the perspectives together, unveiling the connections between them. Moreover, this review presents an organized overview of the topic of TBC and points out topics for future research.

In the wine bottling process, thermoplastics are commonly used to manufacture the crown of cork stoppers. The production of agglomerated cork stoppers generates a type of waste called cork powder (CoP) in large volumes with known properties but which are still underutilized. At present, although there are many agrocomposites available with additives such as natural fibers or solid residues from agricultural products, there are no studies describing the formation of these agrocomposites from petroleum-derived synthetic plastics combined with cork dust as a reinforcement for the polymeric matrix. The present study describes a novel agrocomposite, which has been obtained by mixing polypropylene-type materials, as they are some of the most widely used and versatile thermoplastics, with cork dust, which is a waste product obtained from the cork industry. The composite is obtained directly, without the need for grafting, adhesive polymers, or coupling agents. A superior mechanical performance compared to the unprocessed polymer was highlighted in the test results, thus evidencing the reinforcing function played by the waste in the polymer matrix. Therefore, this novel agrocomposite could be a promising alternative to replace some petroleum-derived synthetic plastics, which are currently experiencing high demand. The use of this new agrocomposite is well aligned with sustainability strategies, the principles of the circular economy, and oriented towards the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals required by the European Union, considering that it contributes (a) to recycling agricultural waste that would otherwise be difficult to recover and valorize; (b) to the reduction in the CO2 footprint; and (c) to promoting the use of high-quality secondary raw materials.

The preparation of cement-based supplementary cementitious materials is an important method for the efficient use of iron tailings and the reduction in CO2 emissions. The aim of this study is to improve the reactivity of iron tailings by mixing them with steel slag, slag, and fly ash through orthogonal tests to solve the problem that iron tailings cannot be utilised on a large scale. The compressive strength, hydration products, and microstructure of the iron tailings–cement-based supplementary cementitious materials were investigated using ICP-OES, XRD, TG, FTIR, and SEM. The results revealed that each solid waste raw material played a distinct role in the hydration reaction. In the iron tailings–cement-based supplementary cementitious materials system, steel slag provided Ca2+, OH−, and Si4+ ions, slag provided Ca2+ and Al3+ ions, fly ash contributed a significant amount of Ca2+ and Al3+ ions, and iron tailings offered more nucleation sites and some Si4+ ions for the hydration products. Moreover, there was a synergistic effect among these four materials, promoting the formation of hydration products such as ettringite, C-(A)-S-H gels, and others. When the proportion of IOTs:SS:FA:SL was 9:8:8:2, the highest 7 d compressive strength of cementitious material was 24.8 MPa. When the proportion of IOTs:SS:FA:SL was 9:6:8:4, the highest 28 d compressive strength of cementitious material was 35.0 MPa. This study provides a comprehensive solution for the utilisation of iron tailings and contributes to the high-value green utilisation of solid waste.

Abstract The XPC protein, which is mutated in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group C (XP-C), is a lesion recognition factor in NER, but it has also been shown to interact with and stimulate DNA glycosylases, to act as transcriptional co-activator and on energy metabolism adaptation. We have previously demonstrated that XP-C cells show increased mitochondrial H2O2 production with a shift between respiratory complexes I and II, leading to sensitivity to mitochondrial stress. Here we report a marked decrease in expression of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, in XP-C cells. A transcriptional role for XPC in PGC-1α expression was discarded, as XPC knockdown did not downregulate PGC-1α expression and XPC-corrected cells still showed lower PGC-1α expression. DNA methylation alone did not explain PGC-1α silencing. In four different XP-C cell lines tested, reduction of PGC-1α expression was detected in three, all of them carrying the c.1643_1644delTG mutation (ΔTG) in XPC. Indeed, all cell lines carrying XPC ΔTG mutation, whether homozygous or heterozygous, presented decreased PGC-1α expression. However, this alteration in gene expression was not exclusive to XPC ΔTG cell lines, for other non-related cell lines also showed altered PGC-1α expression. Moreover, PGC1-α expression did not correlate with expression levels of TFAM and SDHA, known PGC-1α target-genes. In turn, PPRC1, another member of the PGC family of transcription co-activators controlling mitochondrial biogenesis, displayed a good correlation between its expression in 10 cell lines and TFAM and SDHA. Nonetheless, PGC-1α knockdown led to a slight decrease of its target-gene protein level, TFAM, and subsequently of a mtDNA-encoded gene, MT-CO2. These results indicate that PGC-1α and PPRC1 cooperate as regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and maintenance in fibroblasts.

Accurately and rationally quantifying the environmental impact of construction and demolition waste (CDW) management is paramount, especially the environmental impact of different waste disposals, and more effective policies should be implemented to manage CDW. However, previous research on CDW disposal has typically ignored the potential for energy recovery and focused on a single environmental impact category. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual framework to assess the environmental impacts under different CDW management scenarios (including reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and landfill), quantifying the global warming potential and resource consumption impacts under different scenarios. This framework incorporates Building Information Modeling to accurately collect data for feedback to the Life Cycle Assessment. The results indicate that Scenario 3, which considers the circular economy strategy, efficiently reuses metals, plastics, glass, and wood, generates recycled aggregate from concrete and cement, recycles bricks and tiles, and uses the remaining waste for energy recovery. This CDW management scenario, which prioritizes reuse and recycling, is the most effective in mitigating carbon emissions, resulting in a reduction of 6.641 × 105 kg CO2 eq. Moreover, it significantly conserves resources and prevents the energy consumption of 4.601 × 107 MJ. Among them, metal reuse saves 42.35% of resources, and plastic reuse saves 31.19% of resources. In addition, increasing the reuse rate and recovery rate can directly avoid carbon emissions and cumulative exergy consumption, effectively alleviating environmental issues. This study can provide new ideas for the treatment of CDW, which can provide a basis for the relevant government departments to formulate CDW management policies.

Abstract Microcosm biofilms can reproduce the complexity of a dental biofilm. However, different forms of cultivation have been used. The impact of the culture atmosphere on the development of microcosm biofilms and their potential to cause tooth demineralization has not yet been deeply studied. Objective This study analyzes the effects of three experimental cultivation models (microaerophile vs. anaerobiosis vs. experimental mixed) on the colony-forming units (CFU) of the cariogenic microorganisms and tooth demineralization. Methodology 90 bovine enamel and 90 dentin specimens were distributed into different atmospheres: 1) microaerophilia (5 days, 5% CO2); 2) anaerobiosis (5 days, jar); 3) mixed (2 days microaerophilia and 3 days anaerobiosis), which were treated with 0.12% chlorhexidine (positive control – CHX) or Phosphate-Buffered Saline (negative control – PBS) (n=15). Human saliva and McBain’s saliva containing 0.2% sucrose were used for microcosm biofilm formation, for 5 days. From the second day to the end of the experiment, the specimens were treated with CHX or PBS (1x1 min/day). Colony-forming units (CFU) were counted, and tooth demineralization was analyzed using transverse microradiography (TMR). Data were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s or Sidak’s test (p<0.05). Results CHX was able to reduce total microorganism’s CFU compared to PBS (differences of 0.3–1.48 log10 CFU/mL), except for anaerobiosis and microaerophilia in enamel and dentin biofilm, respectively. In the case of dentin, no effect of CHX on Lactobacillus spp. was observed. CHX significantly reduced enamel demineralization compared to PBS (78% and 22% reductions for enamel and dentin, respectively). Enamel mineral loss did not differ when compared with the other atmospheres; however, the enamel lesion depth was greater under anaerobiosis. Dentin mineral loss was lower under anaerobiosis when compared with the other atmospheres. Conclusion The type of atmosphere has, in general, little influence on the cariogenic ability of the microcosm biofilm.

Grass collected as part of roadside maintenance is conventionally subjected to composting, which has the disadvantage of generating significant CO2 emissions. Thus, it is crucial to find an alternative method for the utilisation of grass waste. The aim of this study was to determine the specific biogas yield (SBY) from the anaerobic mono-digestion of grass from road verges and to assess the content of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) in grass in relation to the time of cutting and the preservation method of the studied material. The biochemical biogas potential (BBP) test and the FAMEs content were performed on fresh and ensiled grass collected in spring, summer, and autumn. The highest biogas production was obtained from fresh grass cut in spring (715.05 ± 26.43 NL kgVS−1), while the minimum SBY was observed for fresh grass cut in summer (540.19 ± 24.32 NL kgVS−1). The methane (CH4) content in the biogas ranged between 55.0 ± 2.0% and 60.0 ± 1.0%. The contents of ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in biogas remained below the threshold values for these inhibitors. The highest level of total FAMEs was determined in fresh grass cut in autumn (98.08 ± 19.25 mg gDM−1), while the lowest level was detected in fresh grass cut in spring (56.37 ± 7.03 mg gDM−1). C16:0 and C18:0, which are ideal for biofuel production, were present in the largest amount (66.87 ± 15.56 mg gDM−1) in fresh grass cut in autumn. The ensiling process significantly impacted the content of total FAMEs in spring grass, leading to a reduction in total saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and an increase in total unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs). We conclude that grass biomass collected during the maintenance of road verges is a valuable feedstock for the production of both liquid and gaseous biofuels; however, generating energy from biogas appears to be more efficient than producing biodiesel.

Construction and demolition waste (CDW) has been recently identified as a potential aluminosilicate source for geopolymers. However, the available research has mainly focused on developing CDW-based geopolymer pastes and mortars, while studies on geopolymer concretes sourced from CDW have been very limited. Thus, the current study aimed at experimentally identifying different CDW materials suitable for producing geopolymer concretes. Additionally, the study analysed the mechanical, microstructural, and environmental properties of CDW- based geopolymer concrete produced. In this regard, the effect of relevant parameters on the compressive strength development of CDW-based geopolymer concretes was comprehensively investigated, including those related to precursor types/fineness, alkali activator solution, aggregate type/size and curing regimes. Microstructural analyses were also conducted on the selected samples (100% brick waste, 100% tile waste, 100% concrete waste and 75% brick waste + 25% GGBS). Finally, the environmental impact of geopolymer concrete was assessed and compared with similar traditional concrete. Results showed that employing CDWs alone is not suitable to achieve sufficient strengths under all curing regimes. However, the inclusion of 25% GGBS significantly improved the strength performance of CDW-based geopolymer concrete, in comparison to other supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as Class-C fly ash and calcium hydroxide. The particle size of CDWs and concentration of alkaline activators highly affect the performance of CDW-based geopolymer concretes. Utilization of CDWs with particles finer than 75 μm and high concentrations of NaOH (12 M) is recommended to achieve good performance. The results also indicate that almost similar energy is needed for producing CDW-based geopolymer and OPC-based traditional concrete, whereas a huge reduction in CO2 emission (∼40%) was estimated in the case of geopolymers. The outcomes of the current study are expected to contribute to the advancement of geopolymer concrete derived from CDW in addition to providing valuable insights into this type of concrete for practitioners and academics.

The model included two C pools representing CH4 and CO2. Four microbial functional groups control the SOC cycle: fungi FDEP are responsible for depolymerisation of PolyC; heterotrophs BAER are responsible for aerobic respiration on MonoC, MonoCN, MonoCS, and PolyCN; methanogens BMGB are responsible for anaerobic respiration on MonoC; and methanotrophs BMOB are responsible for CH4 oxidation. The C cycle was coupled with the N and S cycles to account for the feedback introduced by e- donors and acceptors on the biotic response of each elemental cycle (Figure 1). Specific to the N cycle, we accounted for atmospheric N2 fixation, NH4+ nitrification by ammonia oxidizers BAOB and nitrite oxidizers BNOB, and NO2- and NO3- denitrification mediated by denitrifiers BDEN. For S, we accounted for reduction, disproportionation, and oxidation reactions mediated by sulphur S reducers BSrRB, thiosulfate and sulfite (S2O32-, SO32-) reducers BThSRB, sulfate SO42- reducers BSRB, S2O32- and SO32- disproportioning microbes BSDB, and photolithoautotroph oxidizers BSOB. Each of the organic and inorganic C, N, and S pools can be in the aqueous and gaseous phases, or minerally-associated, that is, protected from biological action. All the biochemical reactions and corresponding parameters are presented in Supplementary Information in Pasut et al., 2021. Table 1 summarizes the pool aggregation used in this work, and each flux from and to each pool.  Contents We distribute the turnover time and carbon fluxes of global freshwater wetlands. The computational domain covers an average wetland surface area of 3.8 Mkm2 (ranging between 1.2 and 11.4 Mkm2 from 2000 to 2017) described by about 45,000 grid cells at a grid resolution of 0.5 degree (about 50 km at the equator). Grid cells covered by wetlands for at least 2% of the total grid cell area were selected from the SWAMPS v3.2 wetlands database (Poulter et al., 2017), which reported the monthly flooded land area from 2000 to 2017 based on active and passive microwave satellite images excluding lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and saline environments. Each selected grid cell is represented by 2 m atmospheric column that includes four atmospheric layers necessary for heat and gas exchanges, and water flooding (30, 30, 40, and 100 cm thick from land surface upward), one layer of the topsoil (0 to 30 cm), two layers of subsoil (30 to 100 cm), and one layer below the root zone (100 cm thick). Each grid cell is characterized by a depth-specific soil bulk density, porosity, and textural soil fractions (Poggio et al., 2021), hydraulic and thermal conductivity, heat capacity, air-entry potential, and pore volume distribution index (Dai et al., 2013).
