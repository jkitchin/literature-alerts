The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C‐700‐4) simply by a thermal‐driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen‐doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for carbon dioxide reduction into formate. The in‐situ experimental observation on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen‐doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8% and the long‐time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar‐driven system renders the high 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2%, presenting the impressive solar‐to‐fuel conversion.

The urgent need for transition to renewable energy is underscored by a nearly 50 % increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the past century. The combustion of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industrial activities are the main contributors to carbon dioxide emissions in the anthroposphere. Present approaches to reducing carbon emissions are proving inefficient, thereby accentuating the relevance of carbon dioxide photocatalysis in combating climate change - one of the critical issues of public concern. This process uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into valuable products, e.g., clean fuels, effectively reducing the carbon footprint and offering a sustainable use of carbon dioxide. In this context, plasmonic nanoparticles such as gold, silver, and copper play a pivotal role due to their proficiency in absorbing a wide range of light spectra, thereby effectively generating the necessary electrons and holes for the degradation of pollutants and surpassing the capabilities of traditional semiconductor catalysts. This review meticulously examines the latest advancements in plasmon-based carbon dioxide photocatalysis, scrutinizing the methodologies, characterizations, and experimental outcomes. The critical evaluation extends to exploring adjustments in the dimensional and morphological aspects of plasmonic nanoparticles, complemented by the incorporation of stabilizing agents, which may offer additional benefits. Furthermore, the review includes a thorough analysis of production rates and quantum yields based on different plasmonic materials and nanoparticle shapes and sizes, enriching the ongoing discourse on effective solutions in the field. Thus, our work emphasizes the pivotal role of plasmon-based photocatalysts in reducing carbon dioxide, investigating both the merits and challenges associated with integrating this emerging technology into climate change mitigation efforts.

Precise regulation of the active site structure is an important means to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts in CO2 electroreduction. Here, we creatively introduce anionic groups, which can not only stabilize metal sites with strong coordination ability but also have rich interactions with protons at active sites to modify the electronic structure and proton transfer process of catalysts. This strategy helps to convert CO2 into fuel chemicals at low overpotentials. As a typical example, a composite catalyst, CuO/Cu‐NSO4/CN, with highly dispersed Cu(II)‐SO4 sites has been reported, in which CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with a high Faradaic efficiency (−0.5 V vs. RHE, FEHCOO−=87.4%). Pure HCOOH is produced with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.3% at a cell voltage of 2.8 V. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that sulfate promotes CO2 transformation into a carboxyl intermediate followed by HCOOH generation, whose mechanism is significantly different from that of the traditional process via a formate intermediate for HCOOH production.

With the emergence of the global energy crisis and global climate change, renewable energy systems, such as fuel cells that turn off energetic oxygen and carbon cycles, are becoming increasingly important. Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO_2 RR) is an important electrocatalytic process on the gas diffusion electrode of CO_2 electrolyzer, which has been paid more and more attention by researchers. The problems of high cost, low efficiency, weak selectivity and stability of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO_2 RR) also continue to be solved. Catalysts are considered a viable way to solve these problems. The Cu-based nanomaterial catalyst has been proven to have a good positive effect on the reaction. In this paper, the current research results of Cu-based nanomaterials on CO_2 RR were reviewed, and the catalytic effects of several different Cu-based nanomaterials on CO_2 RR reactions were compared. This paper collected the researches on the catalytic effect of copper-based nanomaterials on carbon dioxide reduction reactions in the past ten years, and found that most copper-based nanomaterials can improve the efficiency of the reactions and show good selectivity. The aim of this paper is to provide a possible catalytic direction for the improvement of carbon dioxide reduction reactions in industry

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction offers a promising route to synthesize fuels and value-added chemicals, unfortunately their activities and selectivities remain unsatisfactory. Here, we present a general surface molecular tuning strategy by modifying Cu 2 O with a molecular pyridine-derivative. The surface modified Cu 2 O nanocubes by 4-mercaptopyridine display a high Faradaic efficiency of greater than 60% in electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction to acetate with a current density as large as 380 mA/cm 2 in a liquid electrolyte flow cell. In-situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals stronger *CO signal with bridge configuration and stronger *OCCHO signal over modified Cu 2 O nanocubes by 4-mercaptopyridine than unmodified Cu 2 O nanocubes during electrochemical CO reduction. Density function theory calculations disclose that local molecular tuning can effectively regulate the electronic structure of copper catalyst, enhancing *CO and *CHO intermediates adsorption by the stabilization effect through hydrogen bonding, which can greatly promote asymmetric *CO-*CHO coupling in electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction.

Continuous-flow methodologies offer promising avenues for sustainable processing due to their precise process control, scalability, and efficient heat and mass transfer. The small dimensions of continuous-flow reactors render them highly suitable for light-assisted reactions, as can be encountered in carbon dioxide hydrogenations. In this study, we present a novel reactor system emphasizing reproducibility, modularity, and automation, facilitating streamlined screening of conditions and catalysts for these processes. Through meticulous control over temperature, light intensity, pressure, residence time, and reagent stoichiometry, we conducted hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, yielding selective formation of carbon monoxide and methane using heterogeneous catalysts, including a newly developed ruthenium nanoparticle on titania catalyst. Furthermore, we demonstrated the direct utilization of on-demand generated carbon monoxide in the production of fine chemicals via various carbonylative cross-coupling reactions.

Since the mid-19th century, there has been a steady increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, leading to global warming due to the greenhouse effect. CO2 can be utilized to obtain a large number of organic compounds. The formation of these compounds depends on the methods of CO2 processing, which include biological, thermal conversion, photochemical, and plasma methods. Most of these methods involve the use of catalysts. One of the plasma methods is the electron-catalytic method using a barrier discharge. Studies on the catalytic conversion of CO2 into methanol and formaldehyde were carried out on a laboratory setup consisting of two sources of low-temperature plasma – dischargers, one of which contains a heterogeneous catalyst. Water vapor was used as the source of hydrogen. The formation of methanol and formaldehyde was investigated under different operating modes of the setup. The effect of sample aging for a day was determined. As a result, there is an increase in the concentration of methanol in the sample from 5.8% to 49.74% and formaldehyde from 4.1% to 50.01% for different operating modes of the setup. The observed results are explained by a sharp increase in the yield of oxygen-containing radicals and , which are formed by the interaction of ozone, formed from CO2 in the discharge zone, with aqueous solutions.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising technique for the production of desirable hydrocarbons without the need to resort to fossil resources. However, high overpotentials and poor selectivity remain a challenge for CO2 electro-reduction, especially for deep reduction by more than two electrons. One apparently attractive approach for breaking the scaling relations caused by simultaneous CO2 reduction pathways and for achieving deeper reduction is the use of multi-metallic electrodes, where several promising metal catalysts are present in close proximity. Herein, noting the activity shown by Ni, Cu and Ag for CO2 electroreduction when used individually, we set out to synthesise a tri-metallic "stack" catalyst, NiCuAg, and then to test this for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The stack architecture was successfully generated and the trimetallic NiCuAg system did show improved Faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid when compared to the bare Ni and bimetallic NiCu controls under some select conditions. However, the two-layer NiCu stack and bare Ni exhibited consistently higher Faradaic efficiencies than NiCuAg for deeper CO2 electroreduction to methanol and ethanol, indicating that the combination of three individually promising metals does not necessarily translate into superior catalytic performance for deep carbon dioxide reduction.

For achieving CO2 thermal reduction, a technology combining solid carbon activation and high-temperature CO2 reduction was proposed, named as activated-reduction technology. In this study, this technology is realized by using a circulating fluidized bed and downdraft reactor. Reduced agent parameters (O2/C and CO2 concentration) greatly affect the reduction effect of CO2. In addition, the effect of the activation process on different carbon-based materials can help to broaden the range of carbon-based materials used for CO2 reduction, which is also an important issue. The following three points have been studied through experiments: (1) the influence of the characteristics of the reduced agent (CO2 concentration and O2/C) on CO2 reduction; (2) the performance of different chars in CO2 reduction; and (3) the activation effect of solid carbon. The activation process can develop the pore structure of coal gasification char and transform it into activated char with higher reactivity. The CO concentration in the tail gas is a crucial factor limiting the effectiveness of CO2 reduction, with an experimentally determined upper limit of around 55% at 1200 °C. If CO concentration is far from the upper limit, temperature becomes the significant influencing factor. When the reduced agent O2/C is 0.18, the highest net CO2 reduction of 0.021 Nm3/kg is achieved at 60% CO2 concentration. When the reduced agent CO2 concentration is 50%, the highest net CO2 reduction of 0.065 Nm3/kg is achieved at 0.22 O2/C. Compared with CPGC, YHGC has higher reactivity and is more suitable for CO2 reduction. The activation process helps to reduce the differences between raw materials.

A modified Metal‐Organic Framework UiO‐66‐NH2–based photocathode in a zero‐gap gas phase photoelectrolyzer was applied for CO2 reduction. Four types of porous carbon fiber layers with different wettability were employed to tailor the local environment of the cathodic surface reactions, optimizing activity and selectivity towards formate, methanol, and ethanol. Results are explained by mass transport through the different type and arrangement of carbon fiber support layers in the photocathodes and the resulting local environment at the UiO‐66‐NH2 catalyst. The highest energy‐to‐fuel conversion efficiency of 1.06% towards hydrocarbons was achieved with the most hydrophobic carbon fiber (H23C2). The results are a step further in understanding how the design and composition of the electrodes in photoelectrochemical electrolyzers can impact the CO2 reduction efficiency and selectivity.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR) is capable of converting CO2 into a wide range of value‐added products under relatively mild conditions. Electrocatalyst with high selectivity and activity is crucial for high efficient ECO2RR. Herein, Bi‐In2O3 nanoflower catalysts with different metal ratios synthesized by wet chemical method are used for ECO2RR to produce formate. The results indicate that the hydrogen evolution activity of the Bi‐In2O3 catalysts during ECO2RR is suppressed at a low level and the activity and selectivity of formate production is related to the ratio of Bi to In content in the catalysts. The optimized Bi‐In2O3 catalyst with the ratio of Bi6In94 can achieve a high formate Faradaic efficiency (FEformate) over 80% under a wide potential range from ‐0.7 V to ‐1.2 V vs. RHE, with the maximum value of 88.1% at ‐0.7 V vs. RHE. Meanwhile, the highest formate partial current density reaches 47.7 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.2 V vs. RHE and the current density and Faradaic efficiency remain stable during the 10 h stability test. The enhanced formate formation on Bi‐In2O3 NF can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Bi and In according to the characterizations of the Bi‐In2O3 NF.

The development of high-efficiency catalysts plays a crucial role in advancing CO2 electroreduction techniques. Among potential candidate, diamond-based electrocatalysts show promise due to their broad electrochemical windows, which effectively suppress competitive hydrogen evolution and ensure high CO2 reduction efficiency. In this study, we report an integrated electrode composed of oxygen-terminated diamond nanocone (ODcone) with CoPc-molecules anchoring (CoPc/ODcone). The CoPc/ODcone electrodes exhibited remarkable performance, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.1% for CO at −0.97 V vs. RHE, and maintaining an FECO higher than 80% over a wide potential range of −0.67 V to −1.07 V vs. RHE. The outstanding performance of the CoPc/ODcone electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effects between the nanostructured diamond surface and the CoPc catalyst. The hydroxyl-rich nature of the diamond surface facilitates the anchoring of CoPc molecules and bonding with Co atoms in CoPc. Simultaneously, the nanostructured diamond with sharp tips enhances CO2 adsorption, thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This study provides valuable insights into the utilization of non-metallic carbon materials, particularly diamond, as metal-free catalysts in CO2 electrochemical reduction and tackles challenges such as low current density and poor FE, thus contributing to the advancement of more effective catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.

Electrochemical conversion of CO2 and H2O to value-added products is an attractive approach for sustainable chemical production. Significant progress has been made in the past few decades in improving activity and selectivity, advancing this technology to practical application. Considering the next step for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, improving carbon utilisation efficiency, stability, and energy efficiency are essential. Bipolar membrane (BPM)-based electrolysers, which allow electrodes to be operated under different pH, are advantageous to tackle the challenge mentioned above. Herein, we introduced the current status of CO2 electrolysers, followed by configuration, challenges, progress and outlook for combining reverse-bias BPM with different types of electrolysers. Our aim is to provide insight into developing carbon-efficient and energy-efficient CO2RR systems towards practical application.

## Enhanced CO adsorption and *CO hydrogenation for efficient CO2 deep reduction on MnCu-NC

In CO2RR, enhancing CO adsorption could suppress desorption and increase *CO concentration for deep reduction. An underlying concern is that strong adsorption might result in high thermodynamic barrier for *CO hydrogenation, however, kinetic barrier firstly dominates the reaction pathway and determines the products selectivity. Directed by above idea, CO2RR performance on Mn, Cu doped nitrogenated carbon (MnCu-NC) is comprehensively studied using density functional theory (DFT). MnCu-NC shows a mild limiting potential of -0.59 V (*CO → *CHO) for CH3OH and CH4 products. CO poisoning is likely to cause catalyst deactivation, while CO modified MnCu-NC shows a slightly increased limiting potential of -0.63 V (*COCO → *COCHO) for CH3OH and CH4, and hydrogen evolution is significantly suppressed. Further comparative studies indicate that kinetic barrier for *CO hydrogenation is crucial for deep reduction, and C−O activation, as well as CO adsorption is enhanced by Π-backbonding. Besides, introduction Cu to dual-atom catalyst (DAC) could help retain more electrons and Mn has strong magnetization for charge transfer, both of which improve the charge densities and Π-backbonding strength, thus boosting the remarkable CO2RR performance toward CH4 and CH3OH on MnCu-NC.

Using low-carbon/zero-carbon energy sources and negative emission technologies, and economic policies have proven to be effective measures for electric power plants' CO2 emission mitigation. This study constructs an interval fractional electric power system planning (IFES) model for minimizing CO2 emission intensity considering the interactions between the measures and other constraints under uncertainty. The model is applied to Fujian Province as a real-case study, which contains electricity mix improvement, three types of CO2 emission reduction technologies, one policy. It was found that: (i) System carbon emission intensity is [170, 213] g/RMB; (ii) The proportion of clean energy power generation in Fujian Province will reach [92.32, 93.13]% in the 2055–2060, with nuclear energy, wind power and photovoltaic power generation ranking the top three; (iii) The electricity mix improvement has made the greatest contribution to the carbon neutrality of the power system (74.62%), and the contributions of CCS, DAC, and ESC are (9.11, 5.25, 11.02%) respectively. The research results provide scientific planning solutions for carbon reduction in the power industry in Fujian Province. The developed IF-ESP model can also be used in other regions around the world.

The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuel using solar energy holds significant promise. However, the inefficient use of light and poor production activity have hindered its development. Here, we propose a simple in situ annealing oxidation method by coating a layer of TiO2 outside TiN, a material with a favorable price and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, to create an L-TiNO composite. The yield of CO over L-TiNO (50.8 μmol g−1 h−1) is 56.4 times that over TiO2 (0.9 μmol g−1 h−1) under visible light irradiation in pure aqueous environment, with a selectivity of 95.98%. In-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements reflect the CO2-COOH⁎-CO conversion route happening on L-TiNO. Characterizations like the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) technique confirm the generation of built-in electric field, which facilitates efficient carrier separation and migration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support that L-TiNO with LSPR effect alters the shape of absorbed CO2 to facilitate generation COOH⁎ via forming hydroxyl end group (Ti-OH) and promotes CO⁎ desorption to CO(g). This work provides valuable insights into the coupling of plasmonic materials with semiconductors to achieve efficient solar energy utilization.

Capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is challenging and thermodynamically expensive because of its dilute concentration (421 ppm, December 2023). Utilizing the concentrating effect of dissolving atmospheric CO2 in alkaline solution to form dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), we explored the potential of an alkalotolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanococcus vannielii, to capture and convert CO2 at low partial pressures to methane. Kinetic constants for CO2 reduction to CH4 were determined from experiments in serum bottles at low pCO2 at 30˚C. At pH 7, 8, and 9, the apparent KM is 0.4, 1.2, and 1.2 mM DIC and the apparent vmax is 5.6, 7.8, and 2.9 mmol CH4 L−1 OD−1 hr−1, respectively. Using atmosphere-equilibrated DIC concentrations at pH 7, 8, and 9, methane formation rates were 1.1, 2.3, and 2.1 mmol CH4 L−1 OD−1 hr−1, respectively. Our data show that alkaline hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is an alternative to photosynthetic CO2 fixation for biological capture and conversion of CO2 at atmospheric concentrations at reasonable rates.

Human activities have significantly contributed to the increase in global carbon emissions, leading to adverse environmental effects such as global warming. Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) presents a promising approach to mitigate carbon emissions. This process not only stores the low energy density renewable energies into high energy density chemical bonds, but also produces a variety of valuable products, including one‐carbon products like HCOOH and CO, as well as multi‐carbon products like CH3CH2OH and C2H4. Among them, HCOOH and CO can be produced with over 90% selectivity on various catalysts, indicating their potential for large‐scale applications. However, the precise reaction pathways toward CO and HCOOH remain unclear, and the competition between these pathways often leads to low product selectivity. This review provides an overview of current research on the selective reduction of CO2 to CO and/or HCOOH, encompassing theoretical simulations, catalyst design, and investigations into reaction mechanisms. Additionally, this review highlights the challenges and prospects for the further development and understanding of selective catalysts for CO and HCOOH production, aiming to provide valuable insights for future studies in this intriguing and significant research field.

Achieving sustainable environmental quality has become a critical global issue, necessitating the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate environmental pollution. Hydropower energy has the potential to play a significant role in this effort by providing a clean, renewable energy source that can help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease CO2 emissions. This study examines the dynamic impact of hydropower energy consumption, economic growth, capital, and labor on Indonesia's CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2020. Applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method, the findings demonstrate that hydropower energy consumption has a negative effect on CO2 emissions in both the short and long term, indicating that increasing hydropower energy consumption leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions. Conversely, labor exhibits a positive influence on CO2 emissions in both the short and long term, suggesting that a rise in labor contributes to higher levels of CO2 emissions in Indonesia. Furthermore, the Granger causality analysis reveals a bidirectional relationship between CO2 emissions and hydropower energy consumption. The robustness of ARDL results is confirmed through additional tests using Fully-Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS), and Canonical Cointegrating Regressions (CCR) methods. The findings underscore the importance of promoting sustainable hydropower energy for effective environmental management in Indonesia. Policymakers should prioritize investments in sustainable hydropower infrastructure, encourage the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, and develop a skilled workforce to mitigate the environmental impact of increased labor force participation.

Abstract Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is expected to play a critical role in reaching net zero CO2 and especially net zero GHG emissions. However, the extent to which the role of CDR in counterbalancing residual emissions can be reduced has not yet been fully quantified. Here, we use a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model to develop a “Maximum Sectoral Effort” scenario which features global emissions policies alongside ambitious effort across sectors to reduce their gross GHG emissions and thereby the CDR required for offsets. We find that these efforts can reduce CDR by over 50% globally, increase both the relative and absolute role of the land sink in storing carbon, and more evenly distribute CDR contributions and associated side-effects across regions compared to CO2 pricing alone. Furthermore, the lower cumulative CO2 and nonCO2 emissions leads to earlier and lower peak temperatures. Emphasizing reductions in gross, in addition to net emissions while disallowing the substitution of less durable CDR for offsets can therefore reduce both physical and transition risks associated with high CDR deployment and temperature overshoot.&#xD;

Abstract Introduction Synchronising the dates of patients’ repeat prescriptions can reduce monthly community pharmacy visits or home deliveries, which may improve patients’ adherence to medicines.[1] It should also reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with avoidable travel, but previous research does not appear to have determined the potential size of this reduction. This pilot study therefore attempted to do so using routinely collected data. Aim To estimate potential carbon savings from synchronising repeat medicines for a sample of patients from one community pharmacy. Methods All patients who had prescriptions dispensed four times per month or more from a single medium-sized (approximately 2,500 items dispensed per month) urban community pharmacy in England were identified from the pharmacy’s home delivery application. The threshold of four deliveries per month was selected to increase the likelihood of this frequency being due to asynchronised prescriptions. Data were collected (August 2023) for deliveries in June 2023 as there were no public holidays or events to affect prescription ordering. Data included patients’ postcode, delivery dates, and using the Patient Medication Record, the pharmacist collecting the data determined acute or one-off prescription items, that neither the patients nor the repeat medicines were new, and where deliveries were made to supply medicines owing. The pharmacy was selected because it efficiently managed stock to minimise items owing. The distance that would have been travelled was calculated as if the medicines had been collected from the pharmacy as a dedicated journey to and from the patient’s home address instead of being delivered. The saving in miles and CO2 emitted for different vehicle types was modelled by assuming that for each patient, all deliveries that were not for acute items or medicines owing could have been reduced to a single delivery if prescriptions had been synchronised. UK Government conversion factors were used to calculate CO2 emissions.[2] Results Data were collected for 59 patients, of whom 7 patients had 8 deliveries, 4 had 7 deliveries, 6 had 6 deliveries, 16 had 5 deliveries and 26 had 4 deliveries. The total number of deliveries to these patients was 269 but would have been 80 deliveries if the repeat prescriptions had been synchronised (70% reduction). The distance travelled would have been reduced from 842 miles to 241 miles (71% reduction). This would have resulted in a 71% reduction in CO2 emissions, although the reduction in volume in kilograms of CO2 emitted would have varied (by an estimated 137 Kg CO2 or 51%) depending on whether e.g., a small diesel car was used or a large petrol car (reduction of 133kg versus 270 kg CO2). An average diesel car was estimated to have reduced CO2 emissions by 163 kg. Conclusion The findings demonstrate that potential carbon savings from medicines synchronisation can be modelled from routinely collected data, but with limited accuracy, especially as patients receiving home deliveries may not be representative of all pharmacy users. Challenges remain in how to measure actual carbon savings of prescription synchronisation and overcoming barriers to widespread implementation of clinically appropriate synchronisation. References 1.

Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) is one of the viable and efficient technology to capture the carbon dioxide from combustion process due to inherent removal of nitrogen. In a typical CLC, combustion of fuel takes place in absence of air, where metal oxides such as ilmenite acts as oxygen carriers therefore, the resultant flue gas contains ∼99% by volume of carbon dioxide. The current work focuses on energy analysis of the chemical looping combustion using Rankine cycles of 662 MWth power plant. The thermal cycle under consideration is conceived with idea of integrating the energy flow between fuel and air reactor and as well as preheating the air and fuel before entering the respective reactors. For the comparative study of thermal performance natural gas and syngas with oxygen carriers nickel oxide with alumina and ilmenite are considered respectively. The composition of syngas under consideration is assumed to be the same as that of generated from gasification of bituminous coal. The energy balance shows that the gross thermal efficiency of the natural gas based CLC thermal cycle and syngas based CLC cycles are 44.99% and 44.80% respectively whereas the net efficiency is found to be 40.13% and 37.6% with carbon capture and compression respectively. The reason for large reduction in net efficiency in the case of syngas-CLC plant is attributed to increase in auxiliary power consumption than natural gas-CLC power plant. The carbon dioxide concentration is higher in case of syngas as it contains higher carbon to hydrogen ratio than that of natural gas. It is also found in the study that carbon capture efficiency is 100% in case of natural gas-CLC power plant whereas for syngas-CLC power plant CO2 capture efficiency is 89.55%.

This study proposes a prospective approach to address the challenge of uneven renewable energy distribution by proposing a renewable energy supply chain leveraging MeOH-fueled Allam Cycle for power generation. This solution aims to meet the escalating demand for renewable energy while ensuring efficient energy transportation and storage. Regions with surplus renewable energy can produce MeOH using green H2 and recycled carbon dioxide (CO2), which can then be transported to regions lacking renewable energy. In importing regions, MeOH is utilized as fuel for electricity generation via Allam Cycle, with captured CO2 recycled for MeOH synthesis, establishing a closed-loop carbon circulation system. The energy, economic and environmental aspects of this supply chain is evaluated and the electricity costs in importing regions are projected to decrease from USD 232.41/MWhe to USD 101.57/MWhe, with MeOH costs dropping from USD 583.47/t to USD 171.48/t, suppose the costs of renewable electricity in exporting regions decrease from USD 45/MWhe to USD 15/MWhe over time. Comparative analysis indicates the energy conversion and transportation costs are acceptable, where the electricity conversion rate is 30.65%-37.07%. Moreover, integration of renewable energy into the supply chain results in a substantial reduction in process carbon emissions, estimated at approximately 90%. Finally, the proposed design showcases a promising and cost-effective solution for achieving a sustainable future, with the onshore wind supply chain exhibiting lower emissions within the range of 51.250-57.464 kg/MWhe.

The main purpose of this study is to quantify and compare the embodied carbon (EC) from the materials used or designed to build the Adohi Hall, a residence building located on the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville, AR. It has been constructed as a mass timber structure. It is compared to the same building design with a steel frame for this study. Based on the defined goal and scope of the project, all materials used in the building structure are compared for their global warming potential (GWP) impact by applying a life cycle assessment (LCA) using a cradle-to-construction site system boundary. This comparative building LCA comprises the product stage (including raw material extraction, processing, transporting, and manufacturing) plus transportation to the construction site (nodule A1–A4, according to standard EN 15804 definitions). In this study, GWP is primarily assessed with the exclusion of other environmental factors. Tally®, as one of the most popular LCA tools for buildings, is used in this comparative LCA analysis. In this study, the substitution of mass timber for a steel structure with a corrugated steel deck and concrete topping offers a promising opportunity to understand the GWP impact of each structure. Mass timber structures exhibit superior environmental attributes considering the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq). Emissions per square meter of gross floor area for mass timber stand at 198 kg, in stark contrast to the 243 kg CO2 eq recorded for steel structures. This means the mass timber building achieved a 19% reduction in carbon emissions compared to the functional equivalent steel structure within the building modules A1 to A4 studied. When considering carbon storage, about 2757 tonnes of CO2 eq are stored in the mass timber building, presenting further benefits of carbon emission delays for the life span of the structure. The substitution benefit from this construction case was studied through the displacement factor (DF) quantification following the standard process. A 0.28 DF was obtained when using mass timber over steel in the structure. This study provides insights into making more environmentally efficient decisions in buildings and helps in the move forward to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and address GWP mitigation.

Africa possesses a profusion of renewable energy resources that can address the continent's need for electricity to foster economic development and achieve international objectives for carbon dioxide mitigation. Green hydrogen stands out as promising among the plethora of available energy production, transportation, and storage technologies. The current study offers a general outlook on green hydrogen production utilizing solar and wind energies powering the water electrolyzers. This analysis estimates the electricity production and its production cost, hydrogen production and production cost, carbon dioxide mitigation, and estimation of the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 2030 in each African country. The results reveal that hydrogen production from solar energy outweighs that from wind. The minimum and maximum power consumption are 64.26–65.46 kWh/kgH2 for the PV/H2 system and 53.62–64.8 kWh/kgH2 for the WT/H2 system. Moreover, the LCOH ranges from 4.6 to 7.31 $/kg for the PV/H2 system and 5.6 to more than 20 $/kg for the WT/H2 system. Namibia and Egypt have significant LCOH of the PV/H2 system with 4.6 and 4.64 $/kg, while Cape Verde and Djibouti have remarkable LCOH of 5.6 and 6.37 $/kg of the WT/H2 system. The percentage reduction in LCOH is 25.23% for the WT/H2 system and 37% for the PV/H2 system due to adopting the 2030 cost scenario. Moreover, adsorption-based atmospheric water is considered a suitable solution for water supply in arid regions. Finally, the CO2 mitigation ranges from 109.8 to 177.7 kg/m2 for the PV/H2 and 0.1–50.4 kg/m2 for the WT/H2.

The anthropogenic impact of the functioning of livestock complexes on the environment is caused by the release of gaseous air pollutants into the atmosphere, including harmful gases such as methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The latter cause environmental degradation and have a negative impact on the climate balance of the planet. Therefore, the basis of the planned research was to evaluate the effectiveness of different doses of "Scarabei" and "Vodohrai Chystyi Khliv" biodestructors on the emission of harmful gases from pig manure in vitro. In the process of conducting experimental studies, it was established that the addition of "Scarabei" and "Vodohrai Chystyi Khliv" biodestructors to pig waste helps to reduce the level of CH4 emissions up to 14.4% and 22.3%, NH3 up to 23.7% and 39.7%, H2S up to 22.2% and 38.2%, CO2 up to 23.4% and 35.6%, NO up to 14.6% and 23.2%, respectively. Simultaneously, with the reduction of emissions of the studied gases, biodestructors also provide a lower level of pH, i.e., its shift to the acidic side up to 5.54 ("Scarabei") and 5.12 ("Vodohrai Chystyi Khliv"), against 6.2–6.5 – in the control. Thus, the results obtained indicate the feasibility of using the studied biodestructors, such as "Scarabei" and "Vodohrai Chystyi Khliv" at a dose of 40 g/m3 for lower emissions of harmful gases, both when storing manure in storage facilities (lagoons) and directly in the pig keeping premises, which will prevent the negative impact of intensive pig production on the environment.

Due to the anthropogenic increase of atmospheric CO2 emissions, humanity is facing the negative effects of rapid global climate change. Both active emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies are needed to meet the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 °C by 2050. One promising CDR approach is coastal enhanced weathering (CEW), which involves the placement of sand composed of (ultra)mafic minerals like olivine in coastal zones. Although the large-scale placement of olivine sand could beneficially impact the planet through the consumption of atmospheric CO2 and reduction in ocean acidification, it may also have physical and geochemical impacts on benthic communities. The dissolution of olivine can release dissolved constituents such as trace metals that may affect marine organisms. Here we tested acute and chronic responses of marine invertebrates to olivine sand exposure, as well as examined metal accumulation in invertebrate tissue resulting from olivine dissolution. Two different ecotoxicological experiments were performed on a range of benthic marine invertebrates (amphipod, polychaete, bivalve). The first experiment included acute survival and chronic growth tests (10 and 20 days, respectively) of olivine exposure while the second had longer (28 day) exposures to measure chronic survival and bioaccumulation of trace metals (e.g. Ni, Cr, Co) released during olivine sand dissolution. Across all fauna we observed no negative effects on acute survival or chronic growth resulting solely from olivine exposure. However, over 28 days of exposure, the bent-nosed clam Macoma nasuta (Conrad, 1837) experienced reduced burrowing and accumulated 4.2 ± 0.7 μg g ww-1 of Ni while the polychaete Alitta virens (M. Sars, 1835) accumulated 3.5 ± 0.9 μg g ww-1 of Ni. No significant accumulation of any other metals was observed. Future work should include longer-term laboratory studies as well as CEW field studies to validate these findings under real-world scenarios.

Coastal wetlands capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at high rates and store large amounts of “blue carbon” in soils. These habitats are home to a variety of microbial communities that break down organic matter and cycle nutrients, playing a substantial role in coastal biogeochemical balance. Rising sea levels make coastal wetlands more susceptible to saltwater intrusion, which might disrupt biogeochemical processes, such as the sulfur cycle and methane generation/consumption by bacteria thus disrupting existing equilibria. A change in biogeochemical equilibria may produce important climate-related feedback because these systems, while involved in carbon sequestration, also have the potential to emit greenhouse gases, with reported higher emissions in freshwater ecosystems compared to brackish ones. In this study, we characterize the microbial community and geochemical properties in soils of three temperate coastal wetlands along a salinity gradient to assess the effect of salinity on organic matter decomposition and related greenhouse gas emissions. The full-length Oxford Nanopore MinION 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing is used to characterize bacterial communities from soil samples. Results indicate a prevalence of sulfur-reducing bacteria in salinized sites compared to freshwater sites. In brackish environments, there is an emergence of obligate anaerobic taxa associated with sulfate reduction, fatty acid degradation, and denitrifying bacteria. These microbial communities play a significant role in reducing CH4 emissions while simultaneously increasing CO2 emissions within these habitats. This study reveals the structure of microbial communities in wetland soils, crucial for ecosystem understanding and implications in wetland conservation, management, and climate change mitigation.

The exacerbation of environmental pollution and global warming has become more pronounced in the context of economic growth. To address these challenges, the United Nations has put forth the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets, which serve as the primary internationally agreed normative and guiding framework for achieving global sustainable social, economic, and environmental development. Marine ranch, as a model of sustainable fisheries development, responds to the SDGs and promotes marine development in an eco-friendly manner, by cultivating shellfish and algae to effectively absorb carbon dioxide and excess nutrients. This novel study utilizes a quasi-natural experiment of the pilot policy implemented in national-level marine ranch demonstration zones to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of carbon emissions and seawater eutrophication indexes. Panel data from 52 coastal cities spanning the period from 2013 to 2021 are employed to explore the synergistic effects of national-level marine ranches on carbon emission reduction and the improvement of seawater eutrophication status. Analytical tools such as spatial auto-correlation, local cold and hot spot analysis, kernel density analysis, standard deviation ellipse, and multi-period difference-in-difference model were applied to the study. The findings reveal that carbon dioxide emissions and seawater eutrophication indexes show a clustering trend, with carbon emission hotspots expanding towards the northeast and the eutrophication index concentrating in the Bohai Economic Circle. Furthermore, the establishment of national-level marine ranches can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions and weaken the degree of eutrophication in the process of urban development. To enhance the quality of China's ecological environment and further explore the ecological and environmental benefits of marine pastures, additional research and investigation are warranted.

Ag-doped Cu2O immobilized carbon beads (Ag/Cu2O@CB) based composite photocatalysts have been prepared for the removal of levofloxacin, an antibiotic, from water. The photocatalysts were prepared by the processes of chemical reduction and in-situ solid-phase precipitation. The composite photocatalyst was characterized by a porous and interconnected network structure. Ag nanoparticles were deposited on Cu2O particles to develop a metal-based semiconductor to increase the catalytic efficiency of the system and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers. Cellulose-derived carbon beads (CBs) can also be used as electron storage libraries which can capture electrons released from the conduction band of Cu2O. The results revealed that the maximum catalytic degradation efficiency of the composite photocatalyst for the antibiotic levofloxacin was 99.02 %. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model was used to study the reaction kinetics, and the process of photodegradation followed first-order kinetics. The maximum apparent rate was recorded to be 0.0906 min-1. The mass spectrometry technique showed that levofloxacin degraded into carbon dioxide and water in the presence of the photocatalyst. The results revealed that the easy-to-produce photocatalyst was stable and efficient in levofloxacin removing.

Abstract Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials, including structural products and Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) pipes, offer significant carbon footprint reduction when compared to traditional steel alternatives. This is because of the lower energy requirements needed for manufacturing and the lower energy use throughout the product's service life cycle. Global warming and the energy crisis make the use of FRP an attractive material of choice because its use results in less carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere. Climate change affects our competitive landscape in many ways. Businesses face higher raw material prices, rising energy costs, and increasing awareness of manufacturers' and suppliers' environmental impact. Companies that focus on managing and mitigating their carbon footprint will have a competitive advantage over rivals in a carbon-constrained future. They will also be able to conduct their operations in an environmentally sustainable way. The focus of this paper is to compare glass-reinforced epoxy (GRE) pipes and FRP offshore handrails with their steel alternatives, to illustrate the relative energy necessary to manufacture, transport, install, use and "through life maintenance" of the products. The critical success factors of FRP with respect to their carbon footprint will be highlighted to advance the case for this type of material in the offshore industry. This paper is development on an original paper by NOV authors in this paper which includes new supportive technical data and research analysis put in place by two major industry operators MODEC and PETROBRAS.

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction offers a low‐carbon route to ethylene, when powered from renewable energy. Yet, the best‐performing CO 2 electrolysis systems employ neutral or alkaline electrolytes, resulting in low conversion efficiencies, which increases downstream separation costs. High conversion rates can be achieved with acidic electrolytes, albeit at the cost ethylene faradaic efficiency (FE < 45%). As a result, achieving high ethylene selectivity simultaneously with high conversion efficiency is an unmet challenge. Here, a 3D‐nanoporous catalyst is designed to modulate water and CO 2 concentration at the catalyst surface, reaching higher ethylene selectivity in a forward‐bias bipolar MEA that recovers unreacted CO 2 . An ethylene FE of 63% at 150 mA cm −2 is reported, and by optimizing for conversion efficiency, an ethylene FE of 58% along with an overall conversion efficiency of 82% is achieved. Stable performance for > 65 h at industrial current densities combined with a high ethylene concentration in the product stream showcases promising industrial viability.

Abstract Production chemicals are used to improve fluids production in gas and oil fields. These chemicals can contribute to less than 1% (0,1 kg/boe) of the global CO2 emission of a production site (scope 3). On the other hand, production chemicals can support the reduction of the global CO2 emission (Replacement of High CO2 emission chemicals by lower CO2 emission chemicals; Use more efficient chemicals to reduce chemicals consumption to reduce associated CO2 emission; Use production chemicals to improve energy efficiency or limit greenhouse gas emission…). A methodology, based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), was developed with SIMAPRO®. This methodology is considering the global usage of the chemicals and its impact on the process (production increase, GHG reduction….). Results point out that injection of a more efficient chemical can reduce the global carbon footprint. 2 chemistries were compared to scavenge H2S. The replacement of triazine based scavenger by a MBO base scavenger is leading to a decrease of the scavenger injection rate. Even if the costs ($/L) and the CO2 footprint (kgCO2/L) of MBO are higher, global impacts are positive (45% CO2 emission reduction). Injection of a H2S scavenger to valorize the associated gas produced by an oil field (stop of flaring) shows that it is possible to reduce by more than 99% the global CO2 emissions. Flowing improvement in an oil field pipeline with DRA injection can lead to the reduction of the carbon footprint intensity (reduction of CO2 emission per barrel of oil). Other cases studies confirm that production chemicals (DRA, demulsifier…) management allow improving the global CO2 footprint.

Electrocatalysts play a critical role in energy technologies, but the development of active, efficient, and durable catalysts is impeded by the lack of methodologies to deconvolute the complex interplay between various aspects influencing the activity of the catalysts, e.g., the number of active sites, turnover frequency, and the reaction pathways. Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) is an emerging tool for the analysis of electroactive species and has been successfully applied to a variety of reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and hydrogen oxidation reaction. The harmonics generated from FTacV measurements neatly detect underlaying processes not visible by other, more commonly employed techniques for analysis of electrocatalysts, such as the rotating disc electrode and dc voltammetry. The harmonic components enable separating overlapping processes based on differences in kinetics or linearity of response. This paper presents a review of FTacV applied for the analysis of electrocatalysts. It highlights the importance of determining the electrochemically active site density (EASD) to decipher the intrinsic activity of a catalyst and discusses the use of FTacV in dynamic determination of the EASD over the course of a catalyst's working life, as well as the use of FTacV to understand intricate catalytic processes.

With increasing construction and demolition waste, the demand for recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) has risen, yet their inherent poor-quality limits usage. In response, CO2 treatment has been developed to enhance RCA quality while contributing to CO2 reduction efforts. This study investigates the effect of CO2 treatment on RCA with high mortar contents for sustainable construction applications. We optimize treatment conditions by evaluating the CO2 consumption ratio and reaction kinetics under various temperatures, pressures, relative humidity, and initial saturation. X-ray imaging confirms carbonation within the mortar, evidenced by increased greyvalues. Environmental assessment of leachate through pH and heavy metal concentration reveals a significant reduction in chromium concentration and a decrease in pH, suggesting the potential of CO2 conditioning to mitigate the environmental impacts. Mechanical tests, the aggregate crushing value test, and the freeze-thaw resistance test, demonstrate improved resistance and durability, particularly in freeze-thaw resistance. The life cycle assessment analysis shows that a simplified CO2 treatment achieved a significant reduction of 138.257 kg CO2 eq per ton of RCA compared to the conventional RCA process. These findings highlight the dual benefits of CO2 treatment: enhanced mechanical performance and reduced environmental impact, promoting the use of recycled aggregates in sustainable construction practices.

Abstract Manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) materials have recently garnered attention as prospective high‐capacity cathodes, owing to their theoretical two‐electron redox reaction in charge storage processes. However, their practical application in aqueous energy storage systems faces a formidable challenge: the disproportionation of Mn 3+ ions, leading to a significant reduction in their capacity. To address this limitation, the study presents a novel graphitic carbon interlayer‐engineered manganese oxide (CI‐MnO x ) characterized by an open structure and abundant defects. This innovative material serves several essential functions for efficient aqueous energy storage. First, a graphitic carbon layer coats the MnO x molecular interlayer, effectively inhibiting Mn 3+ disproportionation and substantially enhancing electrode conductivity. Second, the phase variation within MnO x generates numerous crystal defects, vacancies, and active sites, optimizing electron‐transfer capability. Third, the flexible carbon layer acts as a buffer, mitigating the volume expansion of MnO x during extended cycling. The synergistic effects of these features result in the CI‐MnO x exhibiting an impressive high capacity of 272 mAh g −1 (1224 F g −1 ) at 0.25 A g −1 . Notably, the CI‐MnO x demonstrates zero capacity loss after 90 000 cycles (≈3011 h), an uncommon longevity for manganese oxide materials. Spectral characterizations reveal reversible cation intercalation and conversion reactions with multielectron transfer in a LiCl electrolyte.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States totaled 5,981 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMT CO2eq) in 2020. Of that, GHG emissions by the pulp and paper sector amounted to 35 MMT CO2eq direct emissions and those by industrial waste landfills summed to 7.4 MMT CO2eq direct emissions. Loss of GHG sinks due to change in land use further contributes to the net GHG emissions. Industrial waste landfills are typically required to comply with certain federal and state regulations, including meeting requirements for final cover systems. Conventional final cover systems have included use of soil covers and/or soil-geosynthetic composite covers. An engineered turf cover provides for an excellent “green” alternative final cover system for industrial waste landfills. This paper discusses various sustainability aspects pertaining to use of an engineered turf final cover, including: (i) significantly low carbon footprint associated with the construction of an engineered turf alternative final cover when compared to closure using a traditional or prescriptive cover system; (ii) saving valuable soil and land resources; (iii) saving water resources by reduction in its use during and after construction; (iv) reducing impacts associated with borrow areas; and (v) reducing overall carbon footprint. Further, when using an engineered turf cover, opportunities exist for beneficial reuse of land, including development of solar energy. A brief discussion on the potential for development of solar energy is included.

Methane emissions from livestock being a major contributor to climate change as methane possesses more global warming potential than carbon dioxide, exacerbating the issue. Therefore, reducing methane emissions is crucial in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable agriculture. Tanzania is endowed with a large livestock population and vast rangelands. The resultant enteric methane emissions share in the agriculture sector was estimated to be 39.71% in 2014. This data suggests that interventions to lower methane emissions in agriculture sectors need to focus on livestock especially ruminants to provide significant reduction. The study found that normalisation of emissions can be facilitated by a set of measures, namely: a) increasing the energy content or quality of ruminant feed to reduce the intensity of methane production in the gut; b) addressing existing problems in pasture use, including deforestation, uncontrolled burning, overgrazing, water shortages and invasive species; c) improving feeding in combination with other livestock management practices to achieve the expected productive effect while reducing methane emissions.    

    

## Mixed-Salt Based Transformational Solvent Technology for CO2 Capture

SRI International developed a novel, water-lean, mixed-salt-based transformational solvent technology under a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)/National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)-funded project. This advanced mixed-salt process (A-MSP) can be operated with high cyclic CO2 loading, and the solution can be regenerated with greater than 10 bar CO2 pressure at temperatures less than 120°C. The team has created a process model and performed a techno-economic evaluation (TEA) to identify development pathways for technology advancement. The A-MSP will provide a reduction in the CO2 capture cost and energy penalties and will have the potential for accelerated scale-up to meet the DOE's new target of <30/tonne-CO2 by 2030 for coal-fired power plant applications. Background and Project Description: New solvent technology alternatives to the monoethanolamine (MEA) process for carbon capture use expensive chemicals and result in a high solvent viscosity, low CO2-loading capacity, and low-pressure CO2 product. For over a decade, SRI International has been improving ammonia-based solvents (e.g., MSP) to overcome most of the challenges inherent to conventional amine-based processes. The results from bench-scale testing showed the two-component, dual-stage MSP has significant advantages over other solvent-based systems that were confirmed by extensive modeling and industrial evaluation. In the MSP chemistry, ammonia plays a dual role; it is the catalyst and the absorbent due to its high mobility and reactivity with CO2. Indeed, ammonia absorbs large amounts of CO2 at low temperature and releases CO2 at high temperature and pressure, making it very useful in CO2 absorption formulations. By blending ammonia with other low-capacity and low-reactivity components to suppress the vapor pressure of ammonia in the absorber and increase the CO2 pressure in the regenerator, we have identified the next-generation A-MSP formulation that can provide a step-change reduction in CO2 capture costs. Our initial analysis indicates that inclusion of a tertiary amine to the mixed-salt formulation will yield a high CO2-loading capacity and high-pressure solvent regeneration at low temperature, thus further reducing the energy penalty of CO2 capture. Similar to the original MSP, the concept of operation of the A-MSP includes two isothermal absorbers, a two-stage regenerator, and auxiliary equipment. The absorber system is designed to integrate downstream of the flue gas desulfurization (FGD) unit in a pulverized coal (PC) power plant. Absorbers operate with two different absorbent compositions optimized for efficient absorption and minimum ammonia slip. Both absorbers operate with liquid recycle using heat exchangers to remove the heat of reaction and keep the solution at the proper temperature for optimum performance. In the absorbers, the bottom stages operate with the highest CO2 loading levels (up to 0.7 mole/mole), just above the solid precipitation concentration for the working temperature. The CO2-rich solutions from the absorbers are then sent to the regenerator through crossflow heat exchangers to recover the heat from returning lean solutions. The A-MSP two-stage regenerator produces two CO2-lean salt streams with high and low ammonia content. These streams are drawn from the lower-middle stage and bottom stage of the regenerator. The regenerator is operated under high-pressure isobaric conditions (10-20 bar) and has a temperature gradient in the column (top ~30°C, and bottom ~ 120°C). In the A-MSP design, operating the regenerator at low temperature (~120°C) and high pressure (>10 bar) eliminates water stripping, thus generating an almost-dry CO2 stream (H2Ovap/CO2 <0.02) at high pressure. The benefits are twofold: reduction of regeneration and CO2 compression energy costs (OPEX reduction) and removal of the expensive first CO2 compression stage (CAPEX reduction). The project research activities include thermodynamic modeling and vapor-liquid-equilibrium (VLE) measurements of multicomponent systems that contain ammonia, potassium carbonate, amine, and water; kinetic measurements of CO2 absorption of select compositions, solvent degradation, and aerosol formation studies; and physical parameter measurements. We developed a mass transfer model and process flowsheet simulation to perform a TEA, and we demonstrated the continuous operation of the A-MSP in a large bench-scale integrated absorber-regenerator system.

The selectivity and stability of catalysts for methanol synthesis from CO2 still remain to be enhanced. In this work, we synthesized a series of Pd/ZrO2 catalysts inversely loaded with various metal oxide promoters (ZnO, In2O3, and CeO2), those would partially cover Pd metal surface and form some new metal-promoter interface, to explore the nature in the performance of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The catalyst synthesized by this approach could limit the growth of Pd particles during the reduction and form new metal–metal oxide interfaces with different functions of CO2 hydrogenation, improving the reaction performance of Pd-ZrO2 catalysts. As a result, the ZnO-Pd/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited the highest CO2 conversion (12.0 %), methanol selectivity (95.6 %), and STY of methanol (472 gMeOHkgcat-1h−1), with excellent stability. The results of HRTEM, H2-TPR, XPS, and XAFS showed that the ZnO-Pd/ZrO2 catalyst had the typical Pd-ZnO interface with Pd2+ species after the H2 reduction, which could enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2. In addition, the in situ DRIFTS and NAP-XPS results implied that the Pd-ZnO interface significantly improved the formation of formate (HCOO*) and methoxy (H3CO*) species, which were considered to be the key intermediates of methanol generation, and thus greatly enhanced the selectivity of methanol.

Natural climate solutions (NCS) offer immediate and cost-effective ways to tackle the climate crisis by transforming atmospheric carbon to soil carbon or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. However, the climate mitigation potential and economic costs of NCS for cropping systems in China remain inconclusive. The major objectives of this study are (i) to estimate the NGHG reduction potential across Chinese main cropping systems caused by NCS, (ii) to quantify the economic costs of adopting optimal management with different abatement potentials. The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was used to estimate the NGHG, including SOC sequestration, N2O emissions, and CH4 emissions. After calibration, we ran the DNDC model with derived data at municipality-level. We estimated the NGHG under current management, adopting optimal management individually, and integrated optimal management to project the maximum NGHG reduction potential caused by NCS. We used the marginal abatement cost method to estimate the economic cost. The four natural climate solutions, N fertilization management (NFM), straw returning management (SRM), tillage management (TM), and rice irrigation management (RIM) can reduce national NGHG in main cropping systems by approximately 118.8 Tg CO2-eq, 116.3 Tg CO2-eq, 35.2 Tg CO2-eq, and 74.4 Tg CO2-eq, respectively. The integrated optimal management may potentially reduce NGHG by 256.9 Tg CO2-eq, equivalent to 90.2% of current NGHG, and 80% of which can be realized at the price of CN¥ 285 (Mg CO2-eq)−1. We further identify the priority NCS for different crops and regions and conclude that nitrogen fertilization management should be the priority NCS at the national level. Our findings highlight the great potential of NGHG reduction by adopting NCS precisely and the importance of optimizing agricultural management as a whole, and they will help policy makers to develop smart-agriculture in China.

Abstract Carbon capture and storage is among a few technologies with the potential to enable significant CO2 emission reductions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as offshore production facilities. Within this context, many offshore operators are evaluating measures to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from their operations including those in Deepwater, and Energy contractors are re-shaping their technological expertise and potential solutions for meeting such challenging and increasing demand for lowering operations emissions. The present paper will focus on a specific potential application, related to the offshore pipeline CO2 transportation from an offshore capture facility (deepwater or shallow water), to a permanent subsea storage location. The work presented is the outcome of a joint effort by Exxon Mobil and Saipem articulated through phases: A framing exercise to shape different scenarios to be analyzed. Engineering execution feasibility screening to characterize the above-mentioned scenarios, and to determine: What are the hurdles for deepwater CO2 capture, transportation via offshore pipeline and its sequestration? The challenges associated with CO2 transportation via an offshore pipeline, are spread among all the areas characterizing the system, e.g.: Flow Assurance: the flowing conditions of CO2 are strongly affected by the impurities content, and the bathymetry which the pipeline path traverses. Material Selection: potential corrosion damage mechanisms must be carefully addressed vs. operating and transient flowing conditions. Structural Integrity: the risk of failure associated with potential Running Ductile Fracture (RDF) must be considered and managed since early design phases. Subsea Equipment: the equipment, not limited to the pipeline and riser, shall be assessed in terms of readiness and technological gaps, if any. Safety: the potential risk of subsea CO2 dispersion shall be carefully evaluated. Economics and Supportive Government Policy: Costs are generally key challenges associated with these potential emissions-reduction initiatives. The study performed covered all the above areas through the involvement of Companies Engineering Departments, SME and Developers. All main building blocks of an offshore CO2 transport system have been analyzed during a high-level conceptual design activity to explore any potential criticality vs. their deployment in the specific application. Location/asset-specific factors, supportive government policy, and continued technological advancements can be expected to remain important elements in operator analyses of the commercial viability of potential emissions reduction initiatives. The findings from the presented activity provide offshore Operators considerations for the possibility of transporting CO2 between offshore CO2 capture location to sequestration reservoirs for permanent storage and provide the offshore industry with useful points of reflection.

The physical properties of shale reservoirs are typically poor, necessitating the use of fracturing technology for effective development. However, the high clay content prevalent in shale formations poses significant challenges for conventional hydraulic fracturing methods. To address this issue, CO2-based fracturing fluid has been proposed as an alternative to mitigate the damage caused by water-based fracturing fluids. In this paper, the applicability of quasi-dry CO2 fracturing in shale reservoirs is examined from three key perspectives: the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid, the fracture characteristics induced by the CO2 fracture fluid, and the potential reservoir damage caused by the fracturing fluid. Firstly, the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid was determined by a rheological experiment. Rheological tests revealed that the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid was significantly influenced by the water–carbon ratio. Specifically, when the water–carbon ratio was 30:70, the maximum viscosity observed could reach 104 mPa·s. Moreover, increasing reservoir temperature resulted in decreased fracturing fluid viscosity, with a 40 °C temperature rise causing a 20% viscosity reduction. Secondly, matrix permeability tests were conducted to investigate permeability alteration during CO2 fracturing fluid invasion. Due to the weak acidity of CO2-based fracturing fluid, the permeability reduction induced by clay hydration was inhibited, and an increase in permeability was observed after a 3-day duration. However, the matrix permeability tends to decrease as the interaction time is prolonged, which means prolonged soaking time can still cause formation damage. Finally, triaxial fracturing experiments facilitated by a three-axis servo pressure device were conducted. The fracture properties were characterized using computed tomography (CT), and 3D reconstruction of fractured samples was conducted based on the CT data. The results demonstrate that CO2 fracturing fluid effectively activates weak cementation surfaces in the rock, promoting the formation of larger and more complex fractures. Hence, CO2 quasi-dry fracturing technology emerges as a method with significant potential, capable of efficiently stimulating shale reservoirs, although a reasonable soaking time is necessary to maximize hydrocarbon production.

High-tech greenhouse horticulture offers efficient crop cultivation that is unaffected by outdoor climate. However, compared to conventional cultivation systems, energy requirements, such as greenhouse heating and control, are larger, and concerns about the associated increase in CO2 emissions exist. Although several previous studies have analyzed CO2 emissions from high-tech greenhouse horticulture, few have covered the entire life cycle. This study aimed to analyze CO2 emissions from high-tech greenhouse horticulture for tomatoes in Japan across the entire life cycle. A hybrid method combining process and input–output analyses was used to estimate life cycle CO2 (LC-CO2) emissions. The emission reduction potential of replacing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for greenhouse heating with wood chips was also examined. The results show that LC-CO2 emissions were estimated to be 3.67 kg-CO2 per 1 kg of tomato, 55.6% of which came from the production and combustion of LPG for greenhouse heating. The substitution of LPG with wood chips has the potential to reduce LC-CO2 emissions by up to 49.1%. However, the improved LC-CO2 emissions are still higher than those of conventional cultivation systems; thus, implementing additional measures to reduce LC-CO2 emissions is crucial.

Abstract The subsea energy industry is under constant pressure, both internally and externally, to provide solutions that better serve the global environment. In recent years the necessity to decarbonize, at every level of the industry, has become one of the most debated concerns globally. The development of additive manufacturing technologies, and their integration into our standard operating practices, presents an opportunity to greatly accelerate our decarbonization efforts. The extent of this opportunity is so vast that we, as a global industry, cannot afford to ignore it. This paper shall present a case wherein additive manufacturing technologies, namely Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and a circular economy mindset were used to manufacture a Tubing Hanger Protector, which is a standard component used in subsea production systems worldwide. The paper shall also cover the series of CO2 footprint calculations that were conducted to underline the potential environmental benefits of adopting such a manufacturing philosophy. Thorough CO2 footprint calculations are presented for manufacturing with additive manufacturing and a circular economy mindset. These are then compared with CO2 footprint calculations for ‘traditional’ manufacturing, wherein a forging is produced and then machined to create the final form of the component. On comparing the CO2 footprint calculations for both manufacturing methods, we see a vast difference in the results. A reduction of over eighty five percent is evident, in favor of the additively manufactured part. Given the built in conservativism of the calculations, i.e. best case data for ‘traditional’ manufacturing and worst case data for additive manufacturing, it is likely that the CO2 footprint reductions stated in this paper are even higher in reality. However, this case study is presented to highlight the opportunities of this type of manufacturing and to serve as a reference to others.

Global Carbon Project (GCP) data shows that natural processes have been sequestering atmospheric CO2 on a yearly basis in proportion to how much the atmospheric CO2 concentration has risen above pre-Industrial levels, the so-called CO2 “sink rate”. Here it is argued that the future trajectory of the sink rate has not been adequately addressed, which has led to overestimation of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and thus of global warming. Additionally, use of the CO2 “airborne fraction” concept has led to some misunderstanding regarding how natural processes remove CO2 from the atmosphere, including unrealistic projections of future sink rates. The 20 land models and 10 ocean models used to estimate rates of CO2 removal from the atmosphere produce a wide variety of results. The GCP averages all of these model results together to obtain a best estimate of the yearly CO2 fluxes. Based upon this average, assuming a linearly declining sink rate into the future derived from GCP data, emissions reductions of only 1% per year totaling 39% below 2023 emissions are required over the next 50 years to stabilize atmospheric CO2 near 457 ppm. Assuming the IPCC best estimate of climate sensitivity of 3 deg. C to a hypothetical doubling of atmospheric CO2, this would meet the 2015 Paris Agreement target of less than 2 deg. C of eventual global-average surface warming. But if observation-based estimates of climate sensitivity around 2 deg. C are assumed, then the 1.5 deg. C Paris goal is easily met. These results, though, are very dependent upon the assumed linear decrease of the future sink rates.

The novel activated carbon with excellent properties prepared by plastic waste as a precursor system is an effective way to solve the problem of CO2 emission and solid waste plastic recycling. However, most of the analysis of the performance of this new high-efficiency activated carbon for the adsorption of CO2 in flue gas is only carried out at the level of material characterization, and the performance evaluation in the actual adsorption process is lacking. Therefore, in this study, a two-dimensional adsorption bed model is established using computational fluid dynamics method. And the effects of different adsorption temperature, desorption temperature, inlet flow rate, porosity and mass transfer coefficient on the adsorption and separation performance of CO2 using waste plastic-based activated carbon are discussed. The results show that the CO2 purity and recovery of the new activated carbon adsorbent can reach 43.13% and 96.08%, and the productivity can reach 152.81 kg t-1 h-1 when the desorption temperature is 400 K. By comparing the commercial adsorbent, the new adsorbent used in this study has certain adsorption advantages in terms of recovery and productivity. It can be further proved that waste plastic-based activated carbon can play a role as an efficient regeneration adsorbent at the CO2 capture level, and can promote negative CO2 emission at the same time. The results of this study provide an important reference for the resource utilization of waste plastics and the development of CO2 emission reduction technology.

Abstract TotalEnergies is committed to the goal of sustainability as it targets to achieve NetZero by 2050. One of the levers to carbon intensity reduction is to reduce direct emission from our portfolio and developing carbon sinks. Hence, the plan is to provide carbon storage services which would store equivalent of 50-100Mt/year of CO2 (TotalEnergies, 2023). To realize this objective, the logical step is by building capacity, in terms of skills and projects, to adapt to the new requirements of CO2 injection. This ambition requires developing viable and sustainable surface and downhole equipment design which can meet the challenges of CO2 injection. Our focus is the case of CO2 that is transported in dense phase to the well and then injected into a highly depleted reservoir. Among the challenges associated with the dense phase CO2 injection into a depleted reservoir is the question of compatible completion strings, tubing connections and Downhole Safety Valve (DHSV); which form the primary well barrier, capable of handling potentially extreme low temperatures and rapid swings of temperatures associated with transient conditions of CO2. Thus far, we have proposed credible load cases for completions stress analysis and developed a methodology / guideline for completions design in highly depleted reservoir. Today, we routinely apply it to every project in focus; to incorporate CO2 sequestration in the project development plans. The results of this methodology clarify the specific need(s) for completions design and associated equipment qualifications for CCS applications in highly depleted reservoir environment.

Abstract Geological carbon storage (GCS) is the most popular technique for sequestering CO2. Usually, GCS is modeled using commercial numerical simulators to make CO2 forecasts for mapping CO2 subsurface movement. However, simulators require high computational resources for complex problems. In this paper wavelet and Fourier neural operator (WNO and FNO) based – machine learning models were employed to rapidly forecast the reservoir pressure and CO2 saturation distribution, under fixed injection locations. Two geological models, SACROC and Sleipner, were used to generate CO2 injection datasets. The efficacy of the WNO model was evaluated through CO2 forecasts on the SACROC dataset, while the trained FNO model on the SACROC dataset was "transferred" to make predictions on the Sleipner dataset. The WNO-based ML method was accurate and efficient, such that the overall mean relative errors for pressure and saturation predictions on the test set were 2.21% and 0.84% respectively. More importantly, the WNO-ML algorithm reduced the prediction time by 90%. The overall mean relative errors for pressure and saturation prediction using transfer learning with the FNO algorithm were 2.48% and 1.79% respectively. Additionally, the application of transfer learning reduced the machine learning model training time and data storage requirement by 61% and 45% respectively. Through reduction of the computational time and data storage requirements for CO2 forecasting, transfer learning makes it possible to conduct more detailed and accurate forecasts, which can help to improve the safety and efficiency of CO2 storage projects.

Abstract This study investigates the effect of five amino acids on the electrodeposition of Cu to enhance its electrocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The amino acids significantly influenced the deposition potential, crystallite size, and surface morphology of the electrodeposited Cu. Electrodeposited Cu with amino acids exhibit significantly smaller crystallites and higher particle density on carbon paper relative to amino acid-free samples. The integration of amino acids into the electrodeposited Cu was confirmed via high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. All electrodeposited Cu exhibits a higher faradaic efficiency (FE) in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 relative to Cu foil (24.2%), regardless of the presence or absence (55.0%) of amino acids when the electrolysis was conducted at −1.27 V vs. RHE. Electrodeposited Cu with L-histidine, containing an imidazole group, demonstrates a higher FE of CH4 (67.6%) and effectively suppressed the hydrogen evolution reaction, highlighting the crucial role of amino acid functional groups, particularly imidazole, in augmenting the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CH4. The study demonstrates the critical influence of specific functional groups in amino acids on the catalytic efficiency of electrodeposited Cu in CO2RR electrocatalysis applications.

Global population growth has influenced further technological and scientific challenges, where the exponential increase in electricity demand stands out. In this context, it is necessary to continue researching alternatives to conventional energy generation to reduce greenhouse emissions. Fuel Cell technology is promising for lowering and storing carbon dioxide emissions in this context. It is a backup system to avoid intermittent problems with wind, solar, or other technologies. Fuel cells correspond to an electrochemical device that converts the chemical energy of a fuel directly into electrical energy. Their main components are the electrodes (anode and cathode), electronically conductive, and electrolyte. In particular, molten carbonate fuel cells use hydrogen as fuel, highlighting their excellent power. However, the high working temperature, close to 650 °C, is a disadvantage due to the reduction of the component’s lifetime. Therefore, for a long-term operation, electrode corrosion behavior must be considered. This thesis aims to study Cu-Ni-Al alloys' microstructure and electrochemical behavior for molten carbonate fuel cells. The metal samples were manufactured using powder metallurgical techniques, such as hot pressing and additive manufacturing. The porosity was analyzed using the Archimedes method. The micro-macrostructure of the samples will be studied before and after exposure to Li2CO3-K2CO3 at 550 °C using surface analysis, such as optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Moreover, gravimetric measurements before and after exposure and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at open circuit potential were used to analyze the corrosion of the anodes in an aerated and controlled environment.

Methane hydrate (MH) is found under the seabed in Japan's exclusive economic zone and is attracting attention as a domestic natural gas resource. One of the methods for extracting methane gas (MG) from sub-seabed MH reservoir is depressurisation. However, the production decelerates after a certain time partly due to the cooling of the reservoir caused by the heat absorption during MH dissociation. Therefore, several enhanced gas recovery (EGR) methods have been proposed, such as injecting CO2 into a sub-seabed sand layer to form CO2 hydrate (CDH) and, using the heat of CDH formation. This method is two functions: EGR and the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. In this study, a numerical method was developed to investigate the performance of the EGR from MH, using the heat of CDH formation. In our previous study, CDH formation model had been installed into a programme code for two-phase flow of CO2 and water in porous media. Based on this code, we newly implemented the state equation, enthalpy model, viscosity model, and heat conduction model of MG and the dissociation model of MH. Then, simulations were performed to form CDH in specific sand-mud alternate layers and to dissociate MH. As a result, it was suggested that increasing the CO2 injection amount potentially increases MH dissociation and the vertical distance between the mud layer capping the injected liquid CO2 and the bottom-simulating reflector of CDH is important to ensure a large CDH region to generate a large amount of heat. It was also shown that even after stopping CO2 injection, MH dissociation can continue for a certain period.

The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising method that can both mitigate the greenhouse effect and generate valuable chemicals. The 2D-M2C12 with high-density transition metal single atoms is a potential catalyst for various catalytic reactions. Using an effective strategy, we screened 1s-Mn2C12 as the most promising electrocatalyst for the CO2RR in the newly reported 2D-M2C12 family. A low applied potential of −0.17 V was reported for the CO2-to-CH4 conversion. The relative weak adsorption of H atom and H2O in the potential range of −0.2 to −0.8 V, ensures the preferential adsorption of CO2 and the following production of CH4. The different loading amounts of Mn atoms on γ-graphyne (GY) were also investigated. The Mn atoms prefer doping in the nonadjacent triangular pores instead of the adjacent ones due to the repulsive forces between d-orbitals when the Mn loading is less than 32.3 wt % (5Mn). As the Mn concentration further increases, adjacent Mn atoms begin to appear, and the Mn@GY becomes metallic or half-metallic. The presence of four adjacent Mn atoms increases the d-band center of Mn@GY, particularly the dz2 center involved in CO2 adsorption, thereby enhancing the adsorption capacity for CO2. These findings indicate that 1s-Mn2C12 with high Mn atomic loadings is an excellent CO2RR electrocatalyst, and it provides new insights for designing efficient CO2RR electrocatalyst.

Polyaniline (PANI) provides an attractive organic platform for CO2 electrochemical reduction due to the ability to adsorb CO2 molecules and in providing means to interact with metal nanostructures. In this work, a novel PANI supported copper catalyst has been developed by coupling the interfacial polymerization of PANI and Cu nanoparticles. The hybrid catalyst demonstrates excellent activity towards production of hydrocarbon products including CH4 and C2H4, compared with the use of bare Cu nanoparticles. A faradaic efficiency of 71.8% and a current density of 16.9 mA/cm2 were achieved at ‐0.86V vs. RHE, in contrast to only 22.2% and 1.0 mA/cm2 from the counterpart Cu catalysts. The remarkably enhanced catalytic performance of the hybrid PANI/Cu catalyst can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the PANI underlayer and copper nanoparticles. The PANI favours the adsorption and binding of CO2 molecules via its nitrogen sites to form *CO intermediates, while the Cu/PANI interfaces confine the diffusion or desorption of the *CO intermediates favouring their further hydrogenation or carbon‐carbon coupling to form hydrocarbon products. This work provides insights into the formation of hydrocarbon products on PANI‐modified Cu catalysts, which may guide the development of conducting polymer‐metal catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.

Abstract Compact, and lightweight solvent-based CO2-capture technology is developed. The technology has undergone pilot-scale demonstration and extensive testing. The aim of this research is to systematically quantify the effects on the process variables associated with pressurized CO2-capture of flue gas streams or other process streams, encompassing both low and high CO2 concentrations. The objective is to verify the technology and to obtain the data necessary for the design of a large-scale demonstration plant, capable of capturing CO2 under real operational conditions. Results from four months of operation of the pilot are presented. The novelty of the technology lies in the CO2 absorption aspect of a solvent-based capture technology, utilizing static mixers and separators for contacting the gas and liquid phases. Consequently, the pilot scale absorption unit has been integrated into an existing solvent regeneration system. The solvent utilized in the demonstration is a 30 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA) solution. Pressurized capture is benchmarked against previous research conducted using the same regeneration unit but previously done with a conventional atmospheric absorption column. The research project has performed extensive testing under atmospheric conditions, yielding substantial amounts of comparable data between conventional atmospheric CO2 capture and the new technology both at atmospheric and pressurized conditions. The results show a greater than 95% CO2 capture rate both for low (2.5 vol%) and high CO2 concentrations (10 vol%). Further, the testing shows significant improvement of mass transfer of CO2 between the phases, and reduced size requirements both from a physical aspect related to dimensions of gas piping, but also with regards to the size of the absorption equipment (i.e., Mixer, separator, and piping in between those two elements). The results obtained have been sufficient to design a large-scale demonstration plant, and dimensions, size, cost, energy requirement and OPEX considerations of a full-scale system will be presented. The novelty of the technology revolves around developing a compact CO2-capture system that can be retrofitted into facilities that has existing emissions points, but most importantly, being able to enable CO2 capture on offshore installations that is not suitable for conventional technologies. The technology is likely to provide a significant cost reduction from a CAPEX perspective due to the reduced size and weight. Capturing CO2 in a compact way at pressurized conditions is likely to add great benefits. Gas turbines manufacturers are developing methods of exploiting the pressurized exhaust after the compression stage upstream expansion to facilitate high pressure CO2-capture, while preserving the energy. The presented technology can be an enabler in this market and bring down cost, size and energy consumption for gas fired power production with CCS.

In the case of Carbon Geological Storage (CGS), the wettability is one of the main parameters controlling the CO2 injection capacity and CO2 plume movement, which affects the safety of long-term CO2 storage. A full evaluation of this parameter is essential for risk evaluation and storage capacity estimation. The objective of this study was to investigate the wettability changes of shales from the Chang 7 Formation in the Ordos Basin by exposing the samples to ScCO2/brine for 10/20/30/and 60 days. The mineral composition, pore structure, chemical functional groups, and surface morphology changes of the shale were analyzed using x-ray diffractometer (XRD), low-temperature nitrogen adsorption (LN-N2), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the solid-drop method was used to measure the contact angle of shale samples at different times of ScCO2 soaking. The results show that after 60 days of continuous ScCO2 soaking, the shale water contact angle and chemical group peak spectrum generally show an increasing trend, which is caused by the reduction of carbonate and clay mineral content. The prolonged time of ScCO2 soaking weakens the shale's water wettability and reduces the water-locking effect (water has a sealing effect in the pore channel of the reservoir), capillary force, and the height of CO2 sequestration columns, which is favorable for shale gas extraction (a method of extracting natural gas from shale rock by CO2 fracturing), but it may increase the CO2 geological leakage risk. The results have important implications for regulating the change of shale water wettability, and this study can also better provide theoretical references for Carbon Geological Storage programs.

Modern ironmaking process relies significantly on fossil-related fuels, which ultimately results in the enormous CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. Biomass of plant origin, as a carbon-neutral energy source, has been considered as an alternative to fossil-based reducing agents such as coke. This study aims to investigate the potential of three woody biomass waste derivatives produced from biomass waste pyrolysis and gasification, namely charcoal, bio-oil, and bio-syngas, as the reducing agents in blast furnace. A model based on heat and mass balance and Gibbs free energy minimisation is proposed to simulate an ironmaking process with assistance of these derivatives. The effects of specific composition of biomass waste derivatives on process operation, CO2 emissions, and coke replacement are explored. Also the effects of H2-rich gas produced from biomass waste gasification on the blast furnace operation are estimated. Results indicate that reactions of woody biomass waste derivatives in blast furnace are complex and greatly dependent on composition. When charcoal has a higher carbon content, lower CO2 concentration is found from the top gas. The higher content of hydrogen in bio-oil will inhibit further reduction in CO2 emissions. Bio-syngas with H2/CO ratio of 1.3 proves to have a remarkable potential to reduce CO2 emissions. From the aspects of available biomass waste resources across the world, woody biomass waste derivatives as reducing agents are more suitable for countries with the limited pig iron production. This study provides a reference on the future of moving forward the decarbonised ironmaking by using woody biomass waste derivatives.

The marine emission trading system can effectively reduce the overall carbon emissions of shipping industry at the macro level. However, previous studies on the emission reduction of shipping companies did not solve the problem of annual emission allowance allocation of liner companies from the perspective of technical efficiency.

Without belittling our industry’s work to arrest climate change, the fact remains that relentless global efforts to secure energy during the past 4 decades have led to only a 7% reduction in the contribution of fossil fuels to the global energy supply. In light of the historic outcomes of COP28 and the stringent agreement of 198 countries to steer away from fossil fuels, it is evident that today’s oil and gas industry is at a crossroads and in an unprecedented race with time to address the trilemma to develop a progressive multitier energy model to balance transitioning to a low-carbon industry with maintaining production and fortifying its commitment to a sustainable future. Empowering, leveraging, and capitalizing on the current investments of our industry in the rapidly developing technologies that are revolutionizing both the renewable and fossil-fuel landscapes are exigently and prudently needed to reach this cornerstone goal. These technologies—such as carbon capture, use, and storage; winds; hydrogen; bioenergy; and geothermal—form more than 28% of the total energy consumption targeted to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 and have a close affinity to the existing resources of the oil and gas industry. Deepwater offshore developments have always been the forefront projects of the industry. After about a decade of fragile outlook and waning investment in these ventures, the trend is showing a dynamic rise since 2022 based on the number of sanctioned projects worldwide and the associated annual capital of more than $200 billion. This is a remarkable affirmation of the resilience of these assets and the confidence in a greener, safer, and more cost-effective future of the industry in general. Rigorous engineering remains the key platform to accomplish the dizzying array of complex work on a daily basis and the linchpin in elevating the performance of deepwater projects from acquisition to abandonment. Opportunity still abounds for the operators of these assets to thrive and endure for the upcoming decades through advancing engineering prowess, bolstering their assets’ designs and operability, and collaborating with counterparts on potential synergies. These are prudent measures to appraise and invest in well-grounded solutions in order to harness the full potential of deepwater developments and improve their operational and overall efficiencies.

Abstract The role of Carbon Capture, Use, and Storage (CCUS) in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for achieving global climate targets. Brazil, as a significant emitter, is actively pursuing CCUS projects and the state of Rio de Janeiro, with its high emissions of industrial activities, presents an opportunity for establishing a CCUS hub. The potential storage reservoir, São Tomé Deep Saline Formation, located in the Campos Basin, offers favorable characteristics for CO2 storage. This srtdy aims to estimate the CO2 storage capacity, perform uncertainty analysis, and comprehensive risk assessments for the Sao Tome reservoir. The methodology involves mapping potential storage reservoirs, 3D geological modeling, and flow simulation to evaluate injectivity, storage potential, containment safety, and monitoring strategies. The results demonstrate a storage capacity of approximately 1 Gt of CO2, injectivity of 1.5 MMt C02/yr/well, and low leakage risk. However, further evaluation is required, including petrophysical characterization and geomechanical data. The proposal includes drilling a new well to acquire additional information and support more robust modeling. The establishment of a CCUS hub in Rio de Janeiro would bring economic, social, and environmental benefits, attracting companies seeking environmentally friendly solutions and facilitating the development of the shallow-water industry. To achieve the Net Zero Scenario by 2050, CCUS plays a crucial role in emissions reduction, and the Sao Tome reservoir presents significant potential for CO2 storage. Continued evaluation and data acquisition are necessary to ensure the feasibility of large-scale CO2 injection projects. The establishment of a CCUS hub in Rio de Janeiro would position the region as a center of environmental responsibility and attract investment and innovation in the energy sector.

The commercial viability of utilizing solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO remains hampered by the sluggish electrocatalytic activity of their electrode materials. Herein, a series of perovskites, Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x = 0.1, 0.2, PSCFNx), was synthesized with varying Ni doping levels. Increasing the Ni doping level induced the production of more oxygen vacancies. The treatment of PSCFNx in a reducing atmosphere caused the structural conversion of PSCFNx to a composite composed of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (RP-PSCFNx) and the exsolved Ni-Fe alloy. Moreover, a heterogeneous interface was formed between the Ni-Fe alloy nanoparticles and RP-PSCFNx structure. The electrocatalytic activity of the reduced PSCFNx (re-PSCFNx) for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) was studied using symmetrical SOEC, revealing that cell performance improved with increasing Ni doping content (i.e., with increasing oxygen vacancy content). The re-PSCFN0.2-based cell exhibited a current density of 2.40 A cm-2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE%) of almost 100% at 850 °C and 1.6 V, which was an 18% improvement compared to the re-PSCFN0.1-based cell. This work provides a strategy for synergistically improving the eCO2RR activity of SOEC by constructing an active heterogeneous interface and increasing the oxygen vacancy content.

SiC was first synthesized using the sol-gel method and subsequent carbothermal reduction method, then xCo/SiC-700 and 30%Co/SiC-T catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal method and thermal treatment. The structure of the catalysts was characterized by XRD, SEM/TEM, XPS, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, etc. Their catalytic activities for ammonia decomposition to produce hydrogen were investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The results showed that the synthesized SiC had a high specific surface area and could evenly disperse Co3O4 nanoparticles, which increased the exposure of active sites and improved the adsorption capacity on the catalyst surface. N2-TPD indicates that 30%Co/SiC-700 has a high N2 adsorption capacity, effectively preventing hydrogen reduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles in the catalyst during ammonia decomposition. CO-TPD shows that Co has the best dispersion on 30%Co/SiC-700 catalyst. CO2-TPD shows the higher the catalyst's basicity, the stronger ammonia's decomposition ability. Among the synthesized catalysts, 30% Co/SiC-700 showed the best catalytic activity for ammonia decomposition, with the ammonia conversion of 78.3% and hydrogen production of 25.0 mmol H2 gcat-1 min-1 at 550 °C under 30,000 mL gcat-1 h-1.

Excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction activity has been demonstrated by transition metals and nitrogen-codoped carbon (M–N–C) catalysts, especially for transition-metal porphyrin (MTPP)-based catalysts. In this work, we propose to use one-step low-temperature pyrolysis of the isostructural MTPP-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and electrochemical in situ reduction strategies to obtain a series of hybrid catalysts of Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) and MTPP, named Co NPs/MTPP (M = Fe, Co, and Ni). The in situ introduction of Co NPs can efficiently enhance the electrocatalytic ability of MTPP (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) to convert CO2 to CO, particularly for FeTPP. Co NPs/FeTPP endowed a high CO faradaic efficiency (FECOmax = 95.5%) in the H cell, and the FECO > 90.0% is in the broad potential range of −0.72 to −1.22 VRHE. In addition, the Co NPs/FeTPP achieved 145.4 mA cm–2 at a lower potential of −0.70 VRHE with an FECO of 94.7%, and the CO partial currents increased quickly to reach 202.2 mA cm–2 at −0.80 VRHE with an FECO of 91.6% in the flow cell. It is confirmed that Co NPs are necessary for hybrid catalysts to get superior electrocatalytic activity; Co NPs also can accelerate H2O dissociation and boost the proton supply capacity to hasten the proton-coupled electron-transfer process, effectively adjusting the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates.

With China’s rapid industrialization and urbanization in the process of socio-economic development, the extensive use of energy has resulted in a large amount of CO2 emissions, which puts great pressure on China’s carbon emission reduction task. Through multivariate socio-economic data, this paper proposes an extraction and screening method of multivariate variables based on land-use types, and the downscaled spatial decomposition of carbon emissions at different scales was carried out by using the spatial lag model (SLM). This paper makes up for the shortcomings of previous studies, such as an insufficient modeling scale, simple modeling variables, limited spatio-temporal span of spatial decomposition, and no consideration of geographical correlation. Based on the results of the spatial decomposition of carbon emissions, this paper explores the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon emissions at different scales. The results showed that SLM is capable of downscaling the spatialization of carbon emissions with high precision, and the continuity of the decomposition results at the provincial scale is stronger, while the differences of the decomposition results at the municipal scale are more obvious within the municipal units. In terms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of CO2 emissions, carbon emissions at both scales showed a significant positive correlation. The dominant spatial correlation types are “Low–Low” at the provincial level, and “Low–Low” and “High–High” at the municipal level. The smaller spatial scope is more helpful to show the geographic dependence and geographic differences of China’s carbon emissions. The findings of this paper will help deepen the understanding of the spatial and temporal changes of carbon emissions in China. They will provide a scientific basis for the formulation of feasible carbon emission reduction policies.

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) with orthostatic intolerance (OI) is characterized by neuro-cognitive deficits perhaps related to upright hypocapnia and loss of cerebral autoregulation (CA). We performed N-back neurocognition testing and calculated the phase synchronization index (PhSI) between Arterial Pressure (AP) and cerebral blood velocity (CBV) as a time-dependent measurement of cerebral autoregulation in 11 control (mean age=24.1 years) and 15 ME/CFS patients (mean age=21.8 years). All ME/CFS patients had postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). A 10-minute 60⁰ head-up tilt (HUT) significantly increased heart rate (109.4 ± 3.9 vs. 77.2 ± 1.6 beats/min, P <0.05) and respiratory rate (20.9 ± 1.7 vs. 14.2 ± 1.2 breaths/min, P < 0.05) and decreased end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2; 33.9 ± 1.1 vs. 42.8 ± 1.2 Torr, P < 0.05) in ME/CFS vs. control. In ME/CFS, HUT significantly decreased CBV compared to control (-22.5% vs -8.7%, p<0.005). To mitigate the orthostatic CBV reduction, we administered supplemental CO2, phenylephrine and acetazolamide and performed N-back testing supine and during HUT. Only phenylephrine corrected the orthostatic decrease in neurocognition by reverting % correct n=4 N-back during HUT in ME/CFS similar to control (ME/CFS=38.5±5.5 vs. ME/CFS+PE= 65.6±5.7 vs. Control 56.9±7.5). HUT in ME/CFS resulted in increased PhSI values indicating decreased CA. While CO2 and Acetazolamide had no effect on PhSI in ME/CFS, PE caused a significant reduction in PhSI (ME/CFS=0.80±0.03 vs ME/CFS+PE= 0.69±0.04, p< 0.05) and improved cerebral autoregulation. Thus, PE improved neurocognitive function in ME/CFS patients, perhaps related to improved neurovascular coupling, cerebral autoregulation and maintenance of CBV.

Abstract Travel to academic conferences—where international flights are the norm—is responsible for a sizeable fraction of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with academic work. In order to provide a benchmark for comparison with other fields, as well as for future reduction strategies and assessments, we estimate the CO2-equivalent emissions for conference travel in the field of astronomy for the prepandemic year 2019. The GHG emission of the international astronomical community’s 362 conferences and schools in 2019 amounted to 42,500 tCO2e, assuming a radiative-forcing index factor of 1.95 for air travel. This equates to an average of 1.0 ± 0.6 tCO2e per participant per meeting. The total travel distance adds up to roughly 1.5 Astronomical Units, that is, 1.5 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. We present scenarios for the reduction of this value, for instance with virtual conferencing or hub models, while still prioritizing the benefits conferences bring to the scientific community.

Among the challenges that wastewater treatment plants face in the path towards sustainability, reducing CO2 emissions and decrease the amount of waste highlight. Within these wastes, those that can cause eutrophication, such as nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) are of great concern. Herein we study a novel process to concentrate nutrients via membrane technology. In particular, we propose the use of forward osmosis, applying the carbonated solvent which contains the CO2 captured from the biogas stream as draw solution. This carbonated solvent has a high potential osmotic pressure, which can be used in forward osmosis to concentrate the nutrients stream. To this end, we present the results of an experimental plan specifically designed and performed to evaluate two main parameters: (1) nutrients concentration; and (2) water recovery. The process designed involves pH adjustment, membrane filtration to separate solids, pH reduction and forward osmosis concentration of nutrients. With this process, concentrations factor for nutrients in between 2 and 2.5 and water recovery of approximately 50 % with water flux of 7 to 8 L/(m2h) can be achieved.

Abstract There is a growing desire in the offshore oil and gas industry to lower CO2 emissions from operations, especially in FPSOs and FLNG units. One method to lower CO2 emission is to reduce power consumption by improving the cooling system so that it utilizes colder water from deep sea. Traditionally, Sea Water Intake Risers (SWIRs), which are usually made of reinforced rubber hoses, are used to supply water from water depths up to 150m to the topside, resulting in an in-take temperature of at least 15°C. Nowadays, many operators have been trying to reach colder water (5-7°C) with target SWIR depths up to 700 m in order to support emission reduction efforts. However, there are many design and material restrictions to achieve this goal. Therefore, this paper focuses on the feasibility for steel and HDPE SWIR configurations for deep sea applications (up to 700m). Conducting a site-specific feasibility assessment at early design stage plays an important role in selecting an optimum SWIR configuration. The main pipe of the SWIRs is generally made of reinforced rubber, steel, or high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The SWIRs are installed in a free hanging configuration at the keel or on the sides of the FPSO. Their design can be challenging for deep water applications due to harsh environmental effects (i.e., wave and current). Interference with adjacent structures such as production risers or mooring lines can make their design even more complicated. In order to investigate the feasibility of 350 m and 700 m SWIRs, nonlinear finite element simulations are performed using HDPE and steel pipes for a conceptual field. The steel SWIRs may provide more confidence in long term reliability as steel is a conventional material for dynamic pipelines (e.g., production risers), but can lead to weight and fabrication constraints for deep water applications. HDPE is neutrally buoyant and eliminates weight restrictions but is also prone to creep, large displacements, and connection challenges. Today, there are many SWIRs in service, operating up to 150 m water depth and their design and operational requirements are well known by the oil and gas industry. Pumping sea water at depths greater than 150 m is a significant advancement for the industry as deeper SWIRs provide colder water and further reduction in the CO2 emission of FPSO's cooling systems. This paper focuses on the challenges and design limits for deep SWIRs (350 m and 700m) made of steel or HDPE.

The upgrading of biogas to value-added syngas through bi-reforming is of enormous significance. The mechanochemical method was adopted to prepare a range of layered double hydroxide-derived bimetallic Ni-Ga catalysts, and the as-prepared catalysts were employed in the bi-reforming of biogas. Comprehensive characterization was carried out to analyze the fresh or spent catalysts. 10Ni10Ga/MgAlO catalyst exhibits high initial catalytic activity in terms of CH4/CO2 conversion (∼96 %/66 %) and satisfying stability up to 120 h without significant deactivation, at 800 ℃ and WHSV = 30,960 mL/g/h. 10Ni10Ga/MgAlO catalyst with direct-reduction pretreatment of catalyst precursor exhibits more homogeneously dispersed active metal sites, which facilitates the dissociation of CH4. Meanwhile, 10Ni10Ga/MgAlO catalyst with electron-rich Ni species, as well as moderately strong and strong basic sites, promotes the CO2 activation, the combined effects result in high initial catalytic activity. In addition, the interaction between active metal site and MgAlO composite oxide, combined with the potential reversible phase transition between Ni3Ga and Ni3GaCx, result into satisfying anti-sintering and anti-coking performance of 10Ni10Ga/MgAlO catalyst, respectively.

Damask rose is an important essential oil crop. In the present study, plants were subjected to three different water deficit levels (70, 40, and 10% available water content) for two periods (June–October). Plant phenology, growth, essential oil yield, gas exchange features, membrane stability and major antioxidant defense elements were monitored across two years. Soil water deficit was related to quicker completion of the growth cycle (up to 7.4 d), and smaller plants (up to 49.7%). Under these conditions, biomass accumulation was jointly constrained by decreased leaf area, chlorophyll content, CO2 intake, and photosynthetic efficiency (up to 82.8, 56.9, 27.3 and 68.2%, respectively). The decrease in CO2 intake was driven by a reduction in stomatal conductance (up to 41.2%), while the decrease in leaf area was mediated by reductions in both number of leaves, and individual leaf area (up to 54.3, and 64.0%, respectively). Although the reactive oxygen species scavenging system was activated (i.e., proline accumulation, and enhanced activity of three antioxidant enzymes) by water deficit, oxidative stress symptoms were still apparent. These effects were amplified, as soil water deficit became more intense. Notably, the adverse effects of water deficit were generally less pronounced when plants had been exposed to water severity during the preceding year. Therefore, exposure to water deficit elicited plant tolerance to future exposure. This phenotypic response was further dependent on the water deficit level. At more intense soil water deficit across the preceding year, plants were less vulnerable to water deficit during the subsequent one. Therefore, our results reveal a direct link between water deficit severity and plant tolerance to future water stress challenges, providing for the first time evidence for stress memory in damask rose.

Draining peatlands to create agricultural land has been the norm in Europe, but in the context of climate change and the loss of biodiversity, these rich ecosystems may reactivate their functions as greenhouse gas sinks and retreat spaces for animals and plants. Against this background, the National Moor Rewetting Strategy was put into effect in Germany in 2023, together with the Natural Climate Protection Action Plan. This article examines the methodology of peatland rewetting from scientific, administrative, social, and technical perspectives. The article focuses on an example of moor rewetting in central Germany: the Rathsbruch moor near the municipality of Zerbst, Saxony-Anhalt. To illustrate the importance of rewetting projects for degraded peatlands, five scenarios with different target soil water levels were considered, and the associated greenhouse gas emissions were calculated for a period of five years. For the planning solution, an estimate of the medium-to-long-term development of the habitat types was made based on current use and the dynamics typical of the habitat. The results for the Rathsbruch moor area showed that increasing the water level in steps of 1, 0.8, or 0.5 m has no significant influence on reducing the CO2 emissions situation, while a depth of 0.3 m has a slight influence. When the water was raised to 0.1 m below the surface (Scenario 5), a significant CO2 reduction was observed. The calculated avoided CO2 costs due to environmental damage show that the environmental benefits multiply with every decimeter of water level increase. The rising groundwater levels and extensification favor the establishment of local biotopes. This means that two of the biggest man-made problems (extinction of species and climate change) can be reduced. Therefore, this research is applicable to the development and planning of recultivation work at municipal and regional levels in Germany and beyond within the framework of EU restoration policy.

HKUST−1 is an MOF adsorbent industrially produced in powder form and thus requires a post-shaping process for use as an adsorbent in fixed-bed separation processes. HKUST−1 is also sensitive to moisture, which degrades its crystalline structure. In this work, HKUST−1, in the form of crystalline powder, was extruded into pellets using a hydrophobic polymeric binder to improve its moisture stability. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) was used for that purpose. The subsequent HKUST−1/TPU extrudate was then compared to HKUST−1/PLA extrudates synthesized with more hydrophilic polymer: polylactic acid (PLA), as the binder. The characterization of the composites was determined via XRD, TGA, SEM-EDS, and an N2 adsorption isotherm analysis. Meanwhile, the gas-separation performances of HKUST−1/TPU were investigated and compared with HKUST−1/PLA from measurements of CO2 and CH4 isotherms at three different temperatures, up to 10 bars. Lastly, the moisture stability of the composite materials was investigated via an aging analysis during storage under humid conditions. It is shown that HKUST−1’s crystalline structure was preserved in the HKUST−1/TPU extrudates. The composites also exhibited good thermal stability under 523 K, whilst their textural properties were not significantly modified compared with the pristine HKUST−1. Furthermore, both extrudates exhibited larger CO2 and CH4 adsorption capacities in comparison to the pristine HKUST−1. After three months of storage under atmospheric humid conditions, CO2 adsorption capacities were reduced to only 10% for HKUST−1/TPU, whereas reductions of about 25% and 54% were observed for HKUST−1/PLA and the pristine HKUST−1, respectively. This study demonstrates the interest in shaping MOF powders by extrusion using a hydrophobic thermoplastic binder to operate adsorbents with enhanced moisture stability in gas-separation columns.

The extensive usage of epoxy resin (EP) is facing the head-scratching challenge of high fire hazard. As such, the in-situ assembly of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) nanocubes on electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanoflakes is performed to acquire the heterojunction of PG@UIO. The corresponding role and behavior in flame retardance are explored in detail. By adding 2.0 wt% PG@UIO, the reductions in peak heat release rate, total heat release, peak smoke production rate, peak CO yield, peak CO2 yield reach 49.2%, 44.3%, 56.1%, 57.7% and 51.3%. The in-situ volatiles analysis points out the reductions of 35.1%, 29.4%, 50.8%, 32.5% in the maximal intensities of aromatic compounds, ethers, CO and HCN. The mechanical interlocking area between PG@UIO nanostructures and EP molecular chains contributes to the enhanced mechanical performances. Specifically, by adding 2.0 wt% PG@UIO, the flexural strength is increased by 50.3%. This work enables a new paradigm for fabricating fire-safe polymer composites with the judicious design of MOFs based flame retardant.

Abstract The Subsea High-Pressure Separation, in this paper named as SHPS, is an innovative subsea separation technology designed to separate gas with high-CO2 content from the reservoir-produced fluid at the seabed. This technology operates under high-pressure conditions and utilizes centrifugal pumps to directly reinject the separated gas stream back into the reservoir. By removing the excess of gas with high CO2 content, the SHPS technology enables efficient separation and contributes to emissions intensity reduction, making it a promising system for carbon capture. The primary objective of the SHPS is to debottleneck the topside gas processing plant and extend the oil production plateau by reducing the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) of the oil stream that reaches the FPSO (Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading) facility. Additionally, the technology addresses challenges posed by high GOR, CO2 content, and productivity index (PI) in ultra-deep water offshore reservoirs, particularly in the Brazilian Pre-salt. This paper provides an overview of the rigorous qualification program developed for the SHPS technology, in accordance with API 17N and 17Q standards. The technological roadmap includes successful completion of experimental tests, early engagement with subsea companies, and a de-risking phase focused on pump design and testes with dense gas as well as dynamic simulations. The remaining phases involve the construction, integration, installation, and operational testing of the SHPS system in the challenging Pre-salt environment, ultimately leading to its qualification as a transformative innovation. Throughout the development of the SHPS, valuable insights have been gained, emphasizing the importance of a clear vision, engaged multidisciplinary project team, market validation, prototyping, testing, risk mitigation, scalability, and adaptability. In conclusion, the SHPS technology offers significant potential for enhancing offshore oil and gas operations. By effectively separating and reinjecting high CO2 content gas into the reservoir, SHPS optimizes production, reduces emissions intensity, and contributes to environmental sustainability. Its integration with carbon capture capabilities adds further value, making it a valuable asset in the industry’s pursuit of cleaner and more sustainable energy production. The collaboration with key players and adherence to industry standards position SHPS as a game-changer in revolutionizing oil and gas production in challenging offshore environments. Overall, SHPS represents a promising solution for the industry, addressing key challenges and contributing to a low-carbon future.

This paper presents a mathematical programming framework for modeling the operations of power systems with high wind power penetration and BESS, accounting for wind and power demand uncertainties. For this, we introduce a multi-objective two-stage stochastic unit commitment model aimed at constructing on/off schedules that balance operating costs and CO2 emissions. Under the realistic limitations imposed by BESS high variable operating cost, we focus on assessing and analyzing the operational impact of BESS for two different integration schemes: wind farm-coupled and stand-alone. The proposed method of solution consists in an augmented ϵ-constrained algorithm with an integrated normalized euclidean distance-based bisection routine to produce more equispaced Pareto optimal solutions. We applied the proposed framework to a modified version of the New England IEEE-39 bus test system for three disjoint cases of analysis: without BESS integration, with BESS integrated into a wind farm, and with a stand-alone BESS integrated into the grid. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework and show substantial benefits in terms of CO2 emissions reductions, particularly in the stand-alone configuration, which, although limited in extent of use, promotes the direct injection of wind power into the grid, the decommitment of polluting thermal units, enhance the use of free or low emissions technologies, and contributes as a provider of spinning reserves.

New mobility, battery electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicle manufacturer strategies to achieve climate neutrality are transforming car design and automotive engineering. As an important styling element and an essential part of emissions-reduction strategies, wheel design is undergoing significant change. Advances in simulation tools, supercomputing and increasingly diverse engineering capabilities are enabling advances in wheel design. These investments and advances are enabling Maxion to deliver on its objective of offering customers the most sustainable wheel option for every vehicle segment. To achieve substantial carbon footprint reductions, however, major innovations are required: replacing aluminum with less energy-intensive materials is a key part of the challenge. With a carbon footprint that is 70% less than aluminum, steel wheels represent a significant opportunity for life cycle CO2 savings. As vehicle manufacturers adjust to the evolving demands of new mobility, the need for improved aerodynamics and changing perceptions of what creates additional value for EV buyers are prompting a shift in attitudes toward steel wheels by program managers. Long overlooked, the industry's commitment to carbon neutrality, sustainability and new mobility, is encouraging a fundamental rethink of the role of steel wheels.

Abstract Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a form of orthostatic intolerance (OI) and a key physiological indicator of autonomic dysfunction that is associated with an increased risk of major cerebrocardiovascular events. Symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion have been reported in patients with OH, which worsens symptoms and increases the risk of syncope. Since pharmacological interventions increase blood pressure (BP) independent of posture and do not restore normal baroreflex control, nonpharmacological treatments are considered the foundation of OH management. While reductions in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) during orthostatic stress are associated with a decrease in end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and hypocapnia in patients with OI, their contribution to the severity of OH is not well understood. These measures have been physiological targets in a wide variety of biofeedback interventions. This study explored the relationship between cardiovascular autonomic control, EtCO2 and cerebral hypoperfusion in patients (N=71) referred for OI. Patients with systolic OH were more likely to be male, older, demonstrate reduced adrenal and vagal baroreflex sensitivity, and reduced cardiovagal control during head-up tilt (HUT) than patients without systolic OH. Greater reduction in CBFv during HUT was associated with a larger reduction in ETCO2 and systolic BP during HUT. While deficits in cardiovascular autonomic control played a more important role in systolic OH, reduced EtCO2 was a major contributor to orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion. These findings suggest that biofeedback treatments targeting both the autonomic nervous system and EtCO2 should be part of nonpharmacological interventions complementing the standard of care in OH patients with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion.

Energy usage and climate change are 21st-century challenges. The main cause of climate change is greenhouse gases (GHGs) which are mostly produced by burning fossil fuels. Therefore, effective solutions for new urban areas are required to mitigate climate change impact and to achieve a balance between different sustainability dimensions. Thus, this research investigates the assessment of applying a new generation of Egyptian cities that possesses an urban identity and architectural character, which is called; the 5th generation of Egyptian cities. An outdoor simulation is performed using ENVI-met software to assess the mutual effect on buildings and street canyon conditions, whereas the street canyon considers urban details, and identifies various environmental sustainability measures. This work shows with courtyarded clustered housing with CEB wall material is more efficient as the simulation results show a reduction in air temperature by (0.71%), mean radiant temperature by (3.91%) as a maximum value in the peak day hour, and better human thermal comfort PMV by (4%) as a maximum value at hours from 10 am to 5 pm and by (2.8%) as an average value all day. An indoor simulation is also applied using Design-Builder software and it shows that there is an average reduction in energy by (5.5%) and CO2 emissions by (3.2%). Also, Thermal comfort (PMV) is better by (18.6%) as an average value.

Multiple-thermal-fluid (MTF) stimulation technology has been successfully applied in heavy-oil reservoir development, resulting in the significant enhancement of oil production. However, the underlying mechanism of multi-component coupling remains unclear. This paper constructs a coupling model for MTF stimulation, investigates the coupling mechanism of different media in various zones during multiple-cycle stimulation operations, and compares the implementation effect with field results. The findings reveal that (1) based on media distribution, the area from near-wellbore to far well locations can be divided into four zones: high-temperature oil-viscosity-reduction zones, compound action zones, energy-replenishment zones, and unaffected zones. (2) In the high-temperature oil-viscosity-reduction zone, the latent heat of vaporization is released by steam, and ultra-heavy oil absorbs heat and reduces its viscosity, which plays a dominant role in the production of MTF. In the compound action zone, hot water, CO2, and N2 exhibit a synergistic effect which enhances overall performance. In the energy-replenishment zone, a small amount of N2 provides pressure maintenance and an additional energy supply. (3) As more cycles of stimulation are conducted, the compound action zone expands, while the energy-replenishment zone contracts. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in contribution rate from the high-temperature viscosity-reduction zone to oil production but an increase from both the compound action zone and energy-replenishment zone up to 30%. Based on the dynamic law of representative wells, this paper proposes a multi-media zonal coupling mechanism, providing a reference for subsequent research on MTF stimulation mechanisms and the adjustment of production measures.

Onions (Allium cepa L) minimally processed presents especially high demand for foodservices, however the cutting process results in an increase in metabolic activity of the tissue, triggering a reduction of its lifetime. Therefore, it was proposed to evaluate the implementation of atmospheres modified (0%O2 , 10%CO2 and 90%N2 ) using two packaging materials (Flexvac® and BOPP®) on the stability of sliced onions against a control sample vacuum packed. The samples were stored for 18 days at 4 °C, and the quality attributes were evaluated in terms of physical-chemical, microbiological and sensorial analysis. The result shows that the three packaging conditions increased value of firmness within the first 5 days of storage, then these values are reduced, which is related to the amount of exudate produced in samples assessed as loss weight , for the three conditions of packaging a loss of 20 % occurs in approximately , being lower for Flexvac®. Sensory analysis, the condition of coextruded vacuum - packaging is that presents greater decrease. In relation to the variables of pH, acidity, color and microbiological growth showed no difference between the treatments. The results indicate that the Flexvac® material is suitable for the packaging of pre - cut onion in modified atmospheres

Addressing carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) losses through composting has emerged as a critical environmental challenge recently, and how to mitigate these losses has been a hot topic across the world. As the emissions of carbonaceous and nitrogenous gases were closely correlated with the composting process, the feasibility of composting duration shortening on C and N loss needs to be explored. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to find evidence-based approaches to reduce composting duration, utilizing the seed germination index as a metric (SCD@GI), for assessing its efficiency on C and N loss reductions as well as compost quality. Our findings reveal that the terminal seed germination index (GI) frequently surpassed the necessary benchmarks, with a significant portion of trials achieving the necessary GI within 60 % of the standard duration. Notably, an SCD@GI of 80 % resulted in a reduction of CO2 and NH3 by 21.4 % and 21.9 %, respectively, surpassing the effectiveness of the majority of current mitigation strategies. Furthermore, compost quality, maturity specifically, remained substantially unaffected at a GI of 80 %, with the composting process maintaining adequate thermophilic conditions to ensure hygienic quality and maturity. This study also highlighted the need for further studies, including the establishment of uniform GI testing standards and comprehensive life cycle analyses for integrated composting and land application practices. The insights gained from this study would offer new avenues for enhancing C and N retention during composting, contributing to the advancement of high-quality compost production within the framework of sustainable agriculture.

The cement and concrete industries face significant challenges in decarbonization due to escalating demand driven by rapid urbanization, population growth, and infrastructure restoration needs. Cement production alone accounts for 8% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, underscoring the urgency of exploring pathways to achieve net-zero emissions in these sectors. With over 120 nations committing to net-zero targets by 2050, a comprehensive examination of emerging carbon-saving technologies is imperative. While several promising innovations are in nascent stages, rigorous life cycle assessments are essential to determine their potential for carbon reduction. Practical strategies for achieving net-zero objectives and UN sustainability goals involve embracing circular economy principles, harnessing diverse by-product sources, fostering stakeholder engagement, and fostering technological innovation. An efficiency approach that integrates advancements in materials science, alternative fuels, and sector-wide efficiencies is crucial for success. This assessment identifies promising technologies, highlights knowledge gaps, underscores the importance of further research, and offers recommendations for implementing best practices on the path to net zero.

Kuwait stands as one of the hottest locations globally, experiencing scorching temperatures that can soar to 50 °C during the summer months. Conversely, in the winter months of December and January, temperatures may plummet to less than 10 °C. Maintaining a comfortable temperature indoors necessitates a substantial amount of energy, particularly during the scorching summer seasons. In Kuwait, most of the electrical energy required for functions such as air conditioning and lighting is derived from fossil fuel resources, contributing to escalating air pollution and global warming. To reduce dependence on conventional energy sources for heating and cooling, this article presents a case study to explore the potential of using geothermal energy for space heating and cooling in Kuwait. The case study involves utilizing a geothermal heat pump (water-sourced heat pump) in conjunction with a vertical-borehole ground heat exchanger (VBGHE). The mentioned system is deployed to regulate the climate in a six-floor apartment block comprising a small two-bedroom apartment on each level, each with a total floor area of 57 m2. Two geothermal heat pumps, each with a cooling capacity of 2.58 kW and a heating capacity of 2.90 kW, connected to two vertical-borehole heat exchangers, were deployed for each apartment to maintain temperatures at 22 °C in summer and 26 °C in winter. The findings indicate that the estimated annual energy loads for cooling and heating for the apartment block are 42,758 kWh and 113 kWh, respectively. The corresponding electrical energy consumption amounted to 9294 kWh for space cooling and 113 kWh for space heating. The observed peak cooling load was approximately 9300 kJ/h (2.58 kW) per apartment, resulting in a power density of 45 W/m2. Moreover, the HP system achieved a 22% reduction in annual electric energy consumption compared to conventional air conditioning systems. This reduction in electric energy usage led to an annual CO2 reduction of 6.6 kg/m2.

Abstract Gas field developments with long tiebacks into existing infrastructure poses flow assurance challenges due to the liquid drop out causing high back pressure and high energy consumption to transport the production leading to high OPEX, CAPEX, and CO2e emissions. A novel Pseudo-Dry-Gas (PDG) concept was developed as an inline gas-liquid separator which separate liquids from the gas and flows into a separate liquid line, along with new approaches to flow assurance design, to induce hydraulically ‘dry gas’ behavior within a wet gas pipeline over the operating envelope. The work aims to demonstrate the techno-economic benefits from a feasibility study focusing on the flow assurance aspects. Comparisons are made for project economics and integrated life cycle CO2 assessment showing the "energy intensity" for PDG and the previous chosen industry-norm concept. A widely accepted industry design software is used to generate data for two concepts based on a mid-water (100-200m) gas and oil field development with a 50 km tieback into an existing platform. Advanced flow assurance design technique is developed to evaluate the optimum location for PDG unit along the pipeline for effective subsea separation coupled with mitigation of flow assurance concerns, primarily hydrates. The performance of the PDG unit was predicted by linking the field data with PDG test data. The test was conducted on a 6" flow loop with 6" PDG prototype with pilot scale unit, covering the operational pressure and temperature and anticipated fluid properties. The CO2 assessment was undertaken in accordance with ISO 14044, linking the reservoir production to the power demand to support production, which was then converted into the equivalent CO2e emission. The results showed that the PDG design removed the need for a new unmanned processing platform over the main field and a new MEG (mono ethylene glycol) regeneration system at an existing platform which also serves as the host tie-in point. The removal of a large jacket with associated topside process equipment and brownfield platform modifications delivers reductions in CAPEX and better economic indicators, NPV (net present value) and IRR (internal rate of return). This beneficial economic outcome is reinforced with a reduction in carbon intensity for PDG concept, with more than 40%, compared to the chosen industry-norm concept. These observations are the net result of changing the internal flow resistance curve of the gas tieback from a quadratic function to a linear function enabling more efficient use of downhole pressure and temperature to reduce the overall carbon intensity of upstream gas production and mitigate flow assurance risks for hydrates and liquid surges. The work will benefit practicing engineers through the evaluation of novel PDG technology concepts for mixed oil and gas tiebacks, currently in pre-production testing phase, to improve the field economic and to evaluate CO2e emissions over the life cycle of a project in accordance with ISO 14044.

The growing interest in cycling as a means of urban transport has led to an increased focus on cyclist safety as a key aspect of urban planning and transport policy. Simulation studies conducted by the International Transport Forum have demonstrated that reductions in CO2 and other pollutants can be achieved in the context of urban transport, thus realising the goals of decarbonising road transport. The spread of modal transport in cities is a potential reality within the next decade. Bicycles play a significant role in this context. This article presents an analysis of data on accidents involving cyclists. National and international data were analysed to identify the main risk factors. The aim of the paper is to analyse the risk to cyclists with an attempt to identify and map the five biggest risks to cyclists in urban traffic. The aim of the research is to raise awareness of cyclist safety issues and to identify directions for further action to reduce accidents and improve overall road safety. The results of the conducted analyses indicate that the risk for cyclists in road traffic (including urban traffic) has been on a noticeable downward trend over the past five to ten years. This trend allows for the mapping of the most significant types/risks in cycling in urban environments, thereby enabling the implementation of risk management strategies based on the method of risk mapping.

Introduction: The reduction of postoperative pain intensity is recognized as one of the major advantages of laparoscopic surgery. However, even though this pain is of low intensity, it is not completely abolished after laparoscopic surgery, and may even be multifactorial in origin. The objective of our study is to evaluate pain after laparoscopic surgery and to highlight the various causes of pain. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive and prospective study involving 337 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for non-traumatic acute abdominal emergencies between February 2018 and October 2021. Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Postoperative pain was present in 335 patients (99.4%) on postoperative day 0 and in 283 patients (83.98%) on postoperative day 1. This pain was of low intensity in the majority of cases (73%, n=246 patients) on postoperative day 0 and (68.5%, n=231 patients) on postoperative day 1. Surgical site pain was present in 134 cases (39.77%), pain related to delayed intestinal transit in 52 cases (15.43%), shoulder pain related to CO2 in 40 cases (11.87%), and a combination of different types of pain was found in 16.7% of patients. Conclusion: Post-laparoscopic surgery pain is multifactorial, of low intensity, and easily managed with first-tier analgesics.

Hydrophobization of nanotextured catalyst materials is a promising route to enhance the yield of N2 and CO2 conversion into green fuels. However, these applications require a hydrophobic coating to not only promote air trapping but also allow charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface. In this work, nano thin films with thicknesses as low as 7 nm were deposited from the plasma phase of perfluorohexene, perfluorodecene, and perfluorooctane (PFO) precursors using a mild vacuum and gentle powers. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization reveal that the resulting films are conformal and hydrophobic thanks to a good retention of CF2 and CF3 moieties. The PFO films exhibited the highest water contact angle and achieved superhydrophobic states when deposited on top of re-entrant nano features, an indication of successful air trapping. Electrochemical studies further demonstrated that the plasma-deposited PFO films allow charge transfer but could only sustain repeated cyclic voltammetry cycles without losing their hydrophobicity when deposited under optimal conditions. This result indicates that plasma deposition could become a viable route for the hydrophobization of electrocatalysts required to enhance the yield of poorly soluble gas reduction reactions.

Addressing the critical scientific challenge of enhancing the catalytic efficiency of transition metal-based metal–organic framework (MOF) materials in the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e– ORR) for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 is of paramount importance in a related field. In this context, we had developed an interface synthetic strategy for constructing a series of bimetallic Ni–M (M = Co, Fe, Cu) center MOFs. This approach capitalized on the strong synergy among metallic ions, effectively regulating the electronic structure and thereby improving the catalytic activity of Ni active sites. Notably, the proposed Ni–Co MOF catalyst demonstrated exceptional 2e– ORR activity, achieving a remarkable H2O2 selectivity of up to 96%. This performance significantly surpassed that of Ni–Fe (54%) and Ni–Cu (67%) MOFs, as well as many other reported transition metal catalysts. Detailed studies on the structure–function relationship at the atomic level unveiled that Ni species in a high oxidation state, effectively regulated and stabilized by adjacent Co2+ ions, played a pivotal role in ensuring the superior 2e– ORR activity of the Ni–Co MOF. These physical-chemical insights into the reaction mechanism and structure–function relationships offer valuable guidance for the rational design of highly efficient MOF-based catalysts and reaction systems for on-site electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 via a 2e– ORR process.

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was coupled with an advanced statistical strategy combining the response surface method (RSM) and the propagation of error (PoE) approach to optimize and test the robustness of the co-firing of ammonia (NH3) and coal in a fluidized bed reactor for coal phase-out processes. The CFD model was validated under experimental results collected from a pilot fluidized bed reactor. A 3k full factorial design of nine computer simulations was performed using air staging and NH3 co-firing ratio as input factors. The selected responses were NO, NH3 and CO2 emissions generation. The findings were that the design of experiments (DoE) method allowed for determining the best operating conditions to achieve optimal operation. The optimization process identified the best-operating conditions to reach stable operation while minimizing harmful emissions. Through the implementation of desirability function and robustness, the optimal operating conditions that set the optimized responses for single optimization showed not to always imply the most stable set of values to operate the system. Robust operating conditions showed that maximum performance was attained at high air staging levels (around 40%) and through a balanced NH3 co-firing ratio (around 30%). The results of the combined multi-optimization process performance should provide engineers, researchers and professionals the ability to make smarter decisions in both pilot and industrial environments for emissions reduction for decarbonization in energy production processes.

CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality and mitigating global warming, in which the supported Pd/In2O3 catalysts are attracting great attention due to their high selectivity. Nonetheless, conventional impregnation methods induce strong metal‐support interaction (SMSI) between Pd and In2O3, which leads to the excessive reduction of In2O3 and the formation of undesirable PdIn alloy in hydrogen‐rich atmospheres. Herein, we innovatively synthesized Pd/In2O3 nanocatalysts by the electrostatic self‐assembly process between surface‐modified composite precursors with opposite charges. And the organic ligands concurrently serve as Pd nanoparticle protective agents. The resultant Pd/In2O3 nanocatalyst demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of Pd nanoparticles with controllable sizes on In2O3 supports and the limited formation of PdIn alloy. As a result, it exhibits superior selectivity and stability compared to the counterparts synthesized by the conventional impregnation procedure. Typically, it attains a maximum methanol space‐time yield of 0.54 gMeOH h‐1gcat‐1 (300 °C, 3.5 MPa, 21,000 mL gcat‐1 h‐1). Notably, the correlation characterization results reveal the significant effect of small‐size, highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles in mitigating MSI. These results provide an alternative strategy for synthesizing highly efficient Pd/In2O3 catalysts and offer a new insight into the strong metal‐support interaction.

In this study, a nitrogen/oxygen co-doped carbon fiber cloth with a hierarchical porous structure was synthesized by one-step carbonization and in situ activation method and acted as binder-free electrode materials for supercapacitors. Cotton fiber cloth served as the carbon precursor, while molecular dispersed CaCl2·6H2O and urea functioned as activator and N dopant, respectively. The influence of molar concentration of CaCl2·6H2O and urea on the microstructure and capacitive performance of the resulting products were investigated. CaCl2·6H2O has an expansion effect on pores, resulting in reduction of micropores. Hence, the specific surface area of the resulting porous carbon increased first and then decreased with the increase of CaCl2·6H2O concentration. In addition, the erosion of NH3 and CO2 (produced by the decomposition of urea) at high temperature on the surface of the samples promoted the formation of porous structure. Urea plays the dual role of doping and activation agent. The morphology and structure analysis shown that the activated samples exhibited hierarchical pore structure, large specific surface area, and high heteroatom content. The optimal sample NAC-20 exhibited good capacitive performance, including high specific capacitance of 260.9 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and good rate performance. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor exhibited a maximum energy density and power density of 16.2 Wh kg−1 and 19.0 kW kg−1, respectively, in 6 M KOH electrolyte. In this work, a green, low-cost molten salt activation method was proposed to synthesis biomass derived porous carbon materials for energy storage devices.

Tumor hypoxia induces the production of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1 alpha, which interacts with NF-kB, leading to cancer proliferation and metastasis. This study investigated the effect of tumor hypoxia modulation using carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2) and nicotinamide on reducing soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with tissue overexpression of HIF-1α ≥10%.A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at Dr. Kariadi Hospital in Semarang, Indonesia, from 2021 to 2022. Newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with tissue HIF-1α ≥10% were randomized into an intervention group (nicotinamide 2,000 mg + carbogen 10 liters/min during R-CHOP) and a control group (R-CHOP alone) for one cycle. sIL-2R levels were measured in the blood before and after intervention.The intervention group showed a significant reduction in sIL-2R levels after chemotherapy (p=0.026), with 85% of samples exhibiting a decrease. In contrast, only 45% of samples in the control group demonstrated a decrease in sIL-2R levels (p=0.184). The median sIL-2R level decreased from 139.50 pg/mL to 70.50 pg/mL in the intervention group, while the control group exhibited an increase from 182.50 pg/mL to 250.00 pg/mL following one cycle of chemotherapy.Tumor hypoxia modulation led to a significant decrease in serum sIL-2R levels, potentially through improvements in the crosstalk between hypoxia and inflammation pathways.

Solar energy technologies are emerging as strong alternatives to their fossil fuel-based conventional counterparts for various applications. Solar water heating system (SWHS) is one of the most adopted technologies all over the world. Moreover, the building sector consumes significant energy from fossil fuels worldwide to meet hot water demand. This fossil fuel consumption can be reduced with the surplus economic and environmental benefits through the refurbishment of SWHSs in residential buildings. Additionally, the student hostels of academic institutes/Universities have great potential to save energy, environment, and money. In view of the same, the technical, economic, and environmental analyses of refurbishing SWHS in the student hostel are presented in the present paper. The analysis is carried out for the hostel named 'Raman' of DIT University, located in Dehradun, India. The energy-saving potentials of flat plate collector (FPC)-based and evacuated tube collector (ETC)-based SWHSs to accomplish the hot water demand of selected site are assessed in comparison with electric geyser. Moreover, the economic analysis is also reported in terms of net present value and benefit-to-cost analysis. Whereas the environmental benefit is presented in terms of reduction in equivalent CO2 emissions through implementing both types of considered SWHSs. It is found that the FPC-based and ETC-based SWHSs can fulfil 60.9% and 67.6% of the energy demand to heat the required water. Whereas, both of the systems are found economically as well as environmentally beneficial and ETC-based SWHS is recommended for the selected site. The present study may be useful for the energy planning and management of student hostels under academic institutes/Universities.

Abstract Three R&D initiatives in seismic data acquisition are presented focusing on the reduction of environmental footprint while reducing the operational cost and increasing the efficiency in offshore field operations. The first initiative is the development of a new seismic sensor that can remain on the seafloor for up to five years, the On Demand Ocean Bottom Node - OD OBN (Lopez et al., 2023), helping to decrease the cost of seismic monitoring surveys. The second initiative is a new type of seismic source with lower environmental impact, the Marine Vibrator, which improves the usage of the available energy of the seismic source within the most useful frequency band for seismic acquisition, suppressing higher frequencies potentially harmful for marine mammals (Wartzok and Ketten, 1999). The third initiative is a pilot 3D seismic acquisition in deep-offshore Brazil using fiber optic cables, originally installed on the seafloor as part of a Permanent Reservoir Monitoring (PRM) system, which will be interrogated using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) while recording shots from a seismic streamer vessel present in the area. It is expected that the 3D seismic data acquired in this manner will offer a good understanding of the potential for DAS application for seismic data acquisition using fibers laid on the seafloor, considering the fiber's limitations in sensitivity and angular response. In addition to conventional applications for reservoir monitoring, these technologies are promising for applications linked to the energy transition, such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects, where the expected low commercial value of the sequestered CO2 requires low-cost monitoring methods to be affordable.

This paper presents a review of the trends and geographic variation of impacts of reactive nitrogen (N) inputs on in Europe through impacts on air, soil and water quality. It illustrates those impacts, by assessing temporal and spatial variation in air, soil and water quality indicators and their exceedances of critical thresholds in view of impacts on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, during 1990-2019. Trends are derived from regular inventory and monitoring data and from simulated trends in air quality using the EMEP model. Well quantified adverse impacts of increased N use are: (i) the effects on human health due to increased tropospheric concentrations of NOx and ozone, and N-induced increases in fine particulate matter, (ii) the contribution of N2O to climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion, (iii) the loss of plant and faunal diversity both in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems via direct and soil mediated impacts, (iv) the acidification of forest soils, with impacts on tree forest nutrition, tree growth and tree vitality, and (v) the eutrophication of marine ecosystems, and associated biodiversity loss and occurrence of harmful algae blooms. Over the period 1990-2019, N inputs to agriculture stayed relatively constant, but the emissions of ammonia (NH3) decreased by 27%, while emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) decreased by 57%. In response to those reductions, concentrations of NOx, and of N in particulate matter also declined, although less than 50%. In contrast, the reduction in NOx-induced ozone concentrations and ozone related indicators (AOT40, SOMO35 and POD) was much less (ca 15-20%). Exceedances of critical ozone concentrations for human health and of critical AOT40 and POD vales for vegetation reduced in a similar order of magnitude. Despite decreasing NH3 emissions, NH3 concentrations showed a slight and steady increase from 1995 onwards, due to the large reduction in SOx emissions. Nitrogen deposition and exceedances of critical N loads for terrestrial ecosystems decreased by ca 60%, but the area exceeding critical N loads only reduced by ca 10%. Unlike N, the area exceeding critical acid loads has declined by more than 90% due to high reduction in SOx and NOx emissions. Trends in nitrate (NO3) concentrations in groundwater varied across Europe, but showed overall limited changes over the last two decades. However, N concentrations in surface water and the area exceeding critical levels in view of aquatic biodiversity has decreased and the same holds for N concentrations in coastal regions. Nevertheless, the eutrophication condition of coastal waters has overall not improved due to adverse impacts of elevated phosphorus inputs. Finally the negative impacts of N induced N2O emissions on climate are estimated to be outweighed by the positive effects of N induced CO2 sequestration, mainly in forests, and this holds for the whole period 1990-2019. Nitrogen hotspots, being areas with high exceedances in critical levels and loads of N compounds in air and water, are concentrated in intensive agricultural areas with high livestock densities and in urban region with strong industrial and traffic activities. Cost-benefit analysis shows that environmental costs of reactive N release to the environment are substantial and tend to exceed the direct economic benefits for agriculture. Given the relevance of N for safeguarding food production it is key to develop integrated and targeted plant nutrition strategies following a food system approach and practices that minimize trade-offs between productivity and the environment. In addition, targeted strategies to further reduce NOx emissions are needed to reduce air quality related health and biodiversity impacts.

Abstract Equinor (hereafter also referred as ‘The Company’) is undergoing an internal transformation reflected not just in its culture but also in its operations and investment portfolio. At the core of this transformation is a strategy built around The Company's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and becoming net-zero by 2050. Relative to 2015, The Company is set to have a 50% net reduction in operated emissions and an upstream carbon intensity of ~6 kg of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) by 2030. One notable area in this space is the decarbonization of Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSO) units, which play a crucial role in offshore hydrocarbon production. The Company's decarbonization activities permeate throughout its management system. In this context, The Company sets clearly and rigorously that projects be evaluated under the Best Available Technique (BAT) principle. These evaluations include scrutiny and screening of the technologies and processes that deal with specific pollutants onboard FPSOs and fixed installations, from noise and discharges during drilling operations to solid waste and fugitive emissions. Assessment of emission reduction potential, abatement cost, benchmarking, experience sharing, and environmental budgeting are important elements in the definition and delivery of successful energy efficient projects. The Company has had a presence in Brazil for more than two decades. The Raia project (former BM-C-33) is a consortium made up of Equinor (35% and operator), Repsol Sinopec Brasil (35%), and Petrobras (30%), which represents the third FPSO unit to be put on production and operated by The Company after Peregrino and Bacalhau. The $9 billion development, located in the Campos basin at a 2900 m water depth, is a gas and oil/condensate project that will process liquids and gas to sales specifications onboard the FPSO. The offshore gas processing is based on an innovative concept and first of a kind in Brazil. With a production start in 2028, the project is to recover above 1 billion boe and deliver 15% of Brazil's entire gas needs. Emission abatement technologies to be implemented onboard the FPSO include: combined cycle for power generation (CCGT),closed flare and cargo vent systems,variable speed drive (VSD) on large compressor drives and,turbo expanders (TEX) for hydrocarbon (HC) dew pointing. The most significant success in the decarbonization onboard the FPSO is the use of a CCGT for power generation. The technology relies on excess heat recovery and a steam turbine. Through this and additional measures, the Raia project was able to shift its carbon footprint by around 64%, resulting in an intensity of 5.6 kg/boe. Further optimization and operational experience could improve the project's carbon intensity. For example, by increasing gas export rates or maintaining controlled flaring during start-up and commissioning activities.

Abstract Over the past four decades, offshore oil and gas (O&G) production in Brazil has transitioned from shallow waters to deep waters, necessitating considerations for ensuring the integrity of subsea systems in this challenging environment. This study focused on field inspection reports that provided insights into the condition of carbon steel pipelines and subsea equipment, which are protected by galvanic cathodic protection. The findings from laboratory testing and thermodynamic simulations conducted under varying environmental conditions were compared with these evaluations. Additionally, a comprehensive survey of historical shipwrecks, which lacked corrosion protection and had remained on the seabed for decades, was conducted. The preservation and partial integrity of these shipwrecks were inferred from images captured during inspections conducted by remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs). By comparing the results of laboratory tests, subsea inspection reports, thermodynamic simulations, and ROV images of shipwrecks, it was observed that the corrosion rate in seawater at considerable depths is significantly reduced. This phenomenon allows shipwrecks to persist on the seabed for extended periods without severe corrosion. Furthermore, the analysis of PETROBRAS technical inspection reports on subsea equipment revealed that components of offshore production systems located in deep waters, which lack effective galvanic cathodic protection, continue functioning without compromising their structural integrity. This analysis supported the investigation of a corrosion protection technique applied to subsea production systems in deep water, based on kinetic considerations that complement existing thermodynamic-based criteria, with minimal risk to structural integrity. Importantly, further investigation is warranted to explore alternative cathodic protection potentials, particularly those exceeding −800 mVAg/AgCl, under high pressure and reduced temperatures. This initiative has contributed to the reduction of CO2 emissions, as there is no longer a need to make two trips to the installation site – one to install the anode skid and another to confirm the reestablishment of the protection potential.

A quantitative analysis of the most cited articles published in the Scopus scientometric database by 2023 is carried out. It is shown that most of the publications, the object of study of which are "green" structures, focus on the study of "green" roofs. It is shown that since 1981, the number of studies on green roofs has been steadily increasing: approximately 45% of articles focus on the benefits in terms of thermal impact and thermal insulation, 18% on rainwater drainage, 15% on air quality, 5% on the noise-absorbing properties of green roofs, and 17% on the costs of building and operating green roofs, recreational facilities, fire protection, and other related issues. The requirements and commonly used materials for a standard green roof are described, as well as the percentage of scientific publications, depending on the functions and layers of green roof construction involved. An analysis of the most cited scientific studies on the impact of green roof systems on wastewater quality was conducted. It is shown that the results of the studies presented in these publications indicate the need for further study of the impact of a "green" roof on the amount of pollution in the water flowing from its surface. It is emphasized that further research should focus on the structural layers of the roof (thickness and materials used), namely the thickness and types of substrate layers, as well as on the conditions of plant care (e.g., fertilization), especially on intensive green roofs. In addition, it should be studied and analyzed how the retention of rainwater by plants and the soil layer of a green roof affects the relative humidity of the air near the building during periods without rain. The most cited scientific studies on the reduction of air pollutants by means of green roofs are analyzed. It is concluded that future research should focus on the study of plant species that are well adapted to growing on roofs (in temperate climates) and most effectively carry out the process of photosynthesis, absorbing CO2 and releasing O2 into the atmosphere around the building. The article analyzes the most cited scientific publications on the noise-absorbing properties of green roofs. It is substantiated that it is necessary to maximize the percentage of green roofs implementation on all buildings and structures in the city so that green roofs can significantly affect the quality of the environment in urbanized areas.

The preparation of polymer composites that incorporate material of a biogenic nature in the polymer matrices may lead to a reduction in fossil polymer consumption and a potentially higher biodegradability. Furthermore, microalgae biomass as biogenic filler has the advantage of fast growth and high tolerance to different types of culture media with higher production yields than those provided by the biomass of terrestrial crops. On the other hand, algal biomass can be a secondary product in wastewater treatment processes. For the present study, an SBS polymer composite (SBSC) containing 25% (w/w) copolymer SBS1 (linear copolymer: 30% styrene and 70% butadiene), 50% (w/w) copolymer SBS2 (linear copolymer: 40% styrene and 60% butadiene), and 25% (w/w) paraffin oil was prepared. Arthrospira platensis biomass (moisture content 6.0 ± 0.5%) was incorporated into the SBSC in 5, 10, 20, and 30% (w/w) ratios to obtain polymer composites with spirulina biomass. For the biodegradation studies, the ISO 14855-1:2012(E) standard was applied, with slight changes, as per the specificity of our experiments. The degradation of the studied materials was followed by quantitatively monitoring the CO2 resulting from the degradation process and captured by absorption in NaOH solution 0.5 mol/L. The structural and morphological changes induced by the industrial composting test on the materials were followed by physical–mechanical, FTIR, SEM, and DSC analysis. The obtained results were compared to create a picture of the material transformation during the composting period. Thus, the collected data indicate two biodegradation processes, of the polymer and the biomass, which take place at the same time at different rates, which influence each other. On the other hand, it is found that the material becomes less ordered, with a sponge-like morphology; the increase in the percentage of biomass leads to an advanced degree of degradation of the material. The FTIR analysis data suggest the possibility of the formation of peptide bonds between the aromatic nuclei in the styrene block and the molecular residues resulting from biomass biodegradation. It seems that in industrial composting conditions, the area of the polystyrene blocks from the SBS-based composite is preferentially transformed in the process.

Abstract Pseudo Dry Gas (PDG) technology is proposed as an alternative concept for transporting multiphase fluids (gas, condensate, and water) for long deep-water subsea tieback developments while delivering significant reductions in Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by the mitigation of compression (Liebana, et al, 2021)). The basis of the PDG system is to remove the liquid from the main pipeline using piggable liquid removal unit(s). With the removal of the majority of liquid, the shape of the internal resistance curve of the tieback is changed from a quadratic function to a linear function over the operational envelope, allowing the pipeline to operate like a "pseudo" dry gas system. The original prototype of this design underwent low pressure flow loop testing (Thomas, et al 2021)). The current work involved the fabrication of a 180 bar rated PDG unit, a subsea magnetic drive pump and the supporting subsea control system for flow loop testing undertaken at TÜV SÜD National Engineering Laboratories (hereinafter NEL), UK. This development program is supported by operators in conjunction with the Net Zero Technology Center. The testing program is developed to encompass the expected operational envelope that the PDG units would see in service aligned to a broad range of asset-based study work and to consider critical non-dimensional flow assurance parameters to ensure scalability. The testing parameters considered are pressure (up to 125 bar), temperature (up to 40 C), and inclination (zero- and two-degrees). In addition, various liquids are considered e.g., two hydrocarbon fluids (representing oil and condensate), brine water, and hydrocarbon and brine water mixture. An extensive number of test points at different liquid and gas superficial velocities are included both with and without the PDG unit installed to allow for baseline comparisons, with entrainment samples being collected upstream and downstream of PDG unit aligned to the Tulsa University technique (Bhaskoro, et al 2024). This paper will focus on how varying certain parameters including superficial gas velocity, superficial liquid velocity, and pressure impacts the separation efficiency and liquid entrainment. Some examples of mapping actual study results onto the high-pressure testing results are included to allow a greater understanding of required versus actual performance. Results show comparable PDG separation performance at high pressure for all cases indicating negligible impact of higher pressures in relation to required performance as linked to the actual study cases.

Environmental stewardship is important in urological oncology given the major crises facing our planet in general and the specific links between environmental destruction and urological cancer care. This includes direct links such as an association between air pollution and higher risk of bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers [1Cohen G. Levy I. Yuval et al.Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and cancer among survivors of myocardial infarction: a 20-year follow-up study.Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2017; 24: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar]. There are also indirect links such as substantial disruptions in cancer care due to climate-related extreme weather events [2Gudenkauf LM, Hathaway CA, Carroll JE, et al. Inequities in the impacts of hurricanes and other extreme weather events for cancer survivors. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. In press. https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-23-1029.Google Scholar]. There are many ways to reduce our environmental impact in daily urological practice. Telemedicine, which increased dramatically among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic [3Dubin J.M. Wyant W.A. Balaji N.C. et al.Telemedicine usage among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional study.J Med Internet Res. 2020; 22e21875Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar], is one important way to do this. A recent systematic review of 48 studies including 68 465 481 telemedicine consultations showed that telemedicine saved 691 825 tons of carbon emissions and 3 318 464 047 km of travel distance [4Rodler S. Ramacciotti L.S. Maas M. et al.The impact of telemedicine in reducing the carbon footprint in health care: a systematic review and cumulative analysis of 68 million clinical consultations.Eur Urol Focus. 2023; 9: 873-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. It also resulted in significant cost savings for patients. Importantly, previous studies have shown that telemedicine for genitourinary cancer care is associated with high rates of satisfaction among both patients and physicians [5Margolin E.J. Pina Martina L.A. Miles C.H. et al.Telemedicine in management of genitourinary malignancies: patient and physician perspectives.Urol Oncol. 2021; 39: 480-486Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar]. Virtual conference participation is another way to reduce our carbon footprint. We previously estimated that the 2019 American Urological Association and European Association of Urology (EAU) conferences resulted in approximately 15 923 and 11 256 metric tons of travel-related CO2 emissions, respectively [6Patel S.H. Gallo K. Becker R. Borin J. Loeb S. Climate change impact of virtual urology meetings.Eur Urol. 2021; 80: 121-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. This is equivalent to approximately 5872 passenger vehicles driven for 1 yr, or the CO2 emissions from 3.05 million gallons of gasoline. Since the study only considered travel-related emissions of attendees, these numbers are likely to reflect substantial underestimation of overall conference-related emissions. That notwithstanding, the numbers highlight the significant impact of conducting meetings virtually rather than in person. For conferences and other meetings held in person, the United Nations and other organizations have published guidance and resources on how to conduct green meetings [7United Nations Environment Programme. Green meeting guide 2009. https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/7834.Google Scholar, 8US Environmental Protection Agency. Sustainable Region 9 green meetings and conferences policy. https://www.epa.gov/p2/sustainable-region-9-green-meetings-and-conferences-policy.Google Scholar]. Examples include choosing a central location to avoid excessive transportation, serving more sustainable food (eg, plant-based and locally sourced options), and avoiding single-use water bottles and paper handouts. We also have an opportunity to reduce environmental impact and health care costs during clinical decision-making with patients. In particular, reducing low-value care and unnecessary testing is an important way to mitigate the environmental burden of health care [9Leapman M.S. Thiel C.L. Gordon I.O. et al.Environmental impact of prostate magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Eur Urol. 2023; 83: 463-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. For example, studies have shown persistent overutilization of inappropriate imaging for staging of low-risk prostate cancer [10Lange S.M. Choudry M.M. Hunt T.C. et al.Impact of choosing wisely on imaging in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.Urol Oncol. 2023; 41: 48.e19-48.e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 11Drangsholt S. Walter D. Ciprut S. et al.Quantifying downstream impact of inappropriate staging imaging in a cohort of veterans with low- and intermediate-risk incident prostate cancer.Urol Oncol. 2019; 37: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar]. This can not only cause undue anxiety, false-positive results leading to additional imaging, and excess costs but also contributes to the environmental burden. The 2023 EAU guidelines on prostate cancer recommend omitting initial prostate biopsy on a shared decision-making basis when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are negative with low clinical suspicion, and performing targeted biopsy only for patients with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System score ≥3 and prior negative biopsy [12Mottet N, Cornford P, van den Bergh RCN, et al. EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG guidelines on prostate cancer. Arnhem, The Netherlands: European Association of Urology; 2023. https://d56bochluxqnz.cloudfront.net/documents/full-guideline/EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG-Guidelines-on-Prostate-Cancer-2023_2023-06-13-141145.pdf.Google Scholar]. A recent life cycle assessment found that if 28% of biopsies were avoided because of negative MRI and targeted-only biopsies were performed as in the PRECISION study [13Kasivisvanathan V. Rannikko A.S. Borghi M. et al.MRI-targeted or standard biopsy for prostate-cancer diagnosis.N Engl J Med. 2018; 378: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar], this would save 1.4 million kg of CO2 emissions per 100 000 patients, or the equivalent of 700 000 l of gasoline, in comparison to a strategy of MRI with systematic and targeted biopsies [9Leapman M.S. Thiel C.L. Gordon I.O. et al.Environmental impact of prostate magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Eur Urol. 2023; 83: 463-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. Use of biparametric MRI is another way to reduce carbon emissions in comparison to multiparametric MRI [9Leapman M.S. Thiel C.L. Gordon I.O. et al.Environmental impact of prostate magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Eur Urol. 2023; 83: 463-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar] when clinically appropriate [14Schoots I.G. Barentsz J.O. Bittencourt L.K. et al.PI-RADS Committee position on MRI without contrast medium in biopsy-naive men with suspected prostate cancer: narrative review.Am J Roentgenol. 2021; 216: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar]. For some urological oncology conditions, clinical guidelines include a choice between different imaging modalities that have substantially different carbon footprints. For example, guidelines for surveillance of stage 1 kidney cancer recommend abdominal computed tomography (CT) or MRI within 6 mo, then testing at least annually with either MRI, CT, or ultrasound [15National Comprehensive Cancer Network. NCCN guidelines: kidney cancer, version 3.2024. https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/kidney.pdf.Google Scholar]. A life cycle assessment from Australia revealed that mean CO2 equivalent emissions are 17.5 kg/scan for MRI, 9.2 kg/scan for CT, and 0.5 kg/scan for ultrasound [16McAlister S. McGain F. Petersen M. et al.The carbon footprint of hospital diagnostic imaging in Australia.Lancet Reg Health West Pac. 2022; 24100459PubMed Google Scholar]. The guidelines also recommend chest X-ray or chest CT annually for 5 yr, for which chest X-ray involves a substantially lower carbon footprint (mean CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.8 kg/scan). It is also important to address environmental impact in the operating room. A systematic review of climate-smart practices in the operating theater identified the following key areas: (1) waste reduction by segregation; (2) waste reduction by recycling, reuse, and reprocessing; (3) sterilization; (4) anesthesia gas management; and (5) improvement of energy use [17Pradere B.

While many of these factors are outside a surgeon's control, the authors recommend that surgeons can most readily take direct action on waste reduction, endorse greater education in this area, and advocate for more climate-smart practices while engaging in supply-chain discussions. Finally, patient counseling should take into consideration recommendations that simultaneously promote health and sustainability [18Cole A.P. Gupta N. Loeb S.

Abstract The energy transition is an inevitable global development driven by geopolitical, environmental, economic and societal factors. It will fundamentally change how we access energy resources and how we will rebalance the growing demand in critical commodities. The global mobility sector consumes about 2/3 of the world crude oil production, which stands currently at or above 105 million barrels of oil per day (mmbopd). Even a minor reduction, for instance by increasing the electric vehicle fleet, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions but further stress our power grids along with an increasing demand in critical minerals, required by clean tech manufacturing. Industry strategies and technology developments have to address this conundrum. Renewable energy sources already significantly contributing to the domestic electricity grid (13% in US in 2021) but are dominated by intermittent resources like wind and solar energy, whereas dispatchable, clean energy resources are neglected. The potential of dispatchable geothermal energy is undisputed, though challenges in subsurface risk assessment, completion technologies, upfront investments and lengthy permitting processes impact the economic potential of this technology. Lithium is the key critical mineral in clean tech, particularly for batteries in the mobility sector due to its excellent energy density to weight ratio. Environmental impact of invasive lithium mineral mining or large evaporation ponds can be avoided by Direct Lithium Extraction from brines. It is a valuable solution particularly when deployed in proximity to mature hydrocarbon basins, attributed to a wealth in subsurface data, existing infrastructure, and qualified human resources. DLE technologies are facing some challenges in terms of freshwater usage, the application of chemical agents, excessive land usage and reliance on external energy supply. Finally, not every brine chemistry is suitable for the envisaged DLE technology. Direct lithium extraction based on electrodialysis employs ion-selective membranes in a clean, emission free process. The technology is robust and takes advantage of successful membrane applications at multiple desalination plants around the world. Along with battery-grade lithium the electrodialysis produces green hydrogen, outputs freshwater and sequesters CO2 as by-products. When combined with a geothermal power generation the technology uses onsite energy and the produced brine in a clean and environmentally friendly process. Lithium-rich reservoirs with a favorable geothermal signature have been reported from mature hydrocarbon basins across the United States and their direct lithium extraction offers attractive economics, given the growing lithium demand forecasted for the next decades. The operations are 100% green and self-sustainable when combined with novel low enthalpy geothermal power production technology. It opens a new running room to rejuvenate mature hydrocarbon basins into energy super basins.

In the latest COP 28 UN Climate Change Conference held in December 2023 in United Arab Emirates, signatory countries promised a transition from carbon energy sources "in a just, orderly and equitable manner" (UNFCC, 2023) to mitigate, accordingly, the worst effects of climate change, and reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In the history of COP summits, though vague with respect to how and when the transition will happen, the latest UN conference set a precedent in affirming the necessity of reducing the use of fossil fuels. (Though, notably, China and India, representing more than one-third of the world's population, did not sign the pledge to triple their output of renewable energy and committed to coal power instead.) Researchers from policy institutes, leading academic institutions and elsewhere have devoted significant effort to explaining the economic benefits transitioning to 'renewable' energy and pursuing the commitments made under the auspices of the UN climate change agreements. Monographs and compendiums as well offer advice on how to navigate and benefit from the transition. Some works address legal and regulatory issues such as Promoting Renewable Energy: The Mutual Supportiveness of Climate and Trade Law (Monti, 2023) or focus upon technical and engineering matters as in Fundamentals and Applications of Renewable Energy (Kanoglu et al., 2023). Looking at each of these themes in turn, we begin with the popular concept of energy security. Energy security is a recurring theme in the design of energy policy even though there is no consensus on how it should be measured or achieved, or on the relevant time frame over which it should be assessed. Ever since petroleum became critical to modern economic life, people have been concerned about whether its supply was 'secure' and would be fairly priced. Of late, such perennial concerns have been used to support renewable energy, but what 'security' precisely involves is uncertain. There are many interesting metrics and indices purporting to measure energy security. It may involve the ratio of domestic supply to domestic consumption, looking at resource estimates or metrics related to economic structure such as producer concentration, energy intensiveness and market conditions. Distinct disciplines, as well, use different metrics. We have the accessibility perspective originating in political science; the availability perspective using geologic and scientific insights; and the affordability perspective with its roots in financial economics (Cherp & Jewell, 2011). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy security signifies "the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price".1 Questioning the validity of energy market insecurity, using historical data and the statistical insights of financial option theory, some authors have argued that petroleum markets are remarkably robust and flexible, and perform well even during 'crises' (Haar & Haar, 2019). Concerns over security are unwarranted and reliance upon imports is not problematic (Robinson, 2007). As we saw recently when Russia invaded Ukraine, prices did not exceed previous highs, markets cleared without excess demand and supply. Though there many perspectives on the concept of energy security, and concerns over it may be arguably unjustified, a common theme running through the renewable energy research and advocacy found in the publications under review is that energy markets are inherently insecure, but renewable energy will address this problem.2 George Hathry opens his work by claiming that both companies and countries will enhance energy security through renewable energy. This claim is also made in the collection edited by Pablo Del Río and Mario Ragwitz (p. 3.) Similarly, in the work edited and authored by Anton Eberhard and Wikus Kruger various authors claim that only through private investment in renewable energy can the energy insecurity of the nations of the Global South be addressed (p. 2.). Further, it is argued that Brazil can address insecurity in electricity supply through renewable energy (p. 290), even though it has 16,172,000 million cubic feet (mmcf) of gas reserves and produces 3.3 million barrels per day (mmbd) of oil; or that Namibia can address its insecurity of electricity supply through displacing imported electricity from South Africa or imported petroleum or natural gas with renewable energy (p. 405) even though Angola, its northern neighbour has 9,711,000 mmcf of gas reserves and produces 1.4 mmbd of oil. Further, in 2021 the Canadian firm Reconnaissance Africa discovered in Namibia 120 billion barrels of oil in the Kango basin. Argentina has 11,142,000 mmcf of natural gas and produces over half a million barrels of oil per day (mmbd) while Brazil has 16,172,000 mmcf of gas reserves and produces 3.3 mmbd of oil. The premise of the proposition that renewable energy is a means of addressing supply insecurity is dubious: most countries are net importers of petroleum, as it is critical to energy and the petrochemical sectors of modern economies, and the global 100 mmbd market is remarkably flexible. Though the purpose of sanctions against Russia was to reduce its revenues from petroleum, with the unintended consequences that its discounted Urals crude went east while Europe found new sources, the events attest to the depth and liquidity of the market. The countries of the Global South that Eberhard and Kruger focus on have bountiful access and supplies of hydrocarbons. International energy markets are not 'insecure' as renewable energy advocates claim; and replacing low-cost imported energy or domestically produced hydrocarbons with expensive renewable energy, as explained below, conflicts with the received economic theory of trade. That energy may be imported does not make it 'insecure', and replacing it through renewable energy may not be economic.3 Although a scenario in which China stops exporting solar PV panels appears remote, we should remember that generating electricity in this manner, like relying upon wind turbines, involves international trade in energy intensive, globally sourced materials.4 Not surprisingly, in all three works we find the theme that transitioning to renewable energy will help the environment by reducing GHG. Georges Hathry begins with this message, as do Pablo Del Río and Mario Ragwitz, whose introductory chapter tells us that satisfying the Paris Agreement of 2015 and achieving sustainable development goals requires transformation of our global energy production and consumption system. In Eberhard and Kruger's collection, the role of the Global South in reducing GHG is a recurring theme. In the eight countries examined – Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, India, South Africa, Zambia, and Namibia – the respective authors, as area experts, explain how private investment and market mechanisms may be used to reduce CO2 emissions, demonstrating commitment to the various COP objectives. Excluding India from the examined countries in the Eberhard and Kruger collection, the CO2 emissions of the other seven countries sum to less than 4.5 per cent of global CO2.5 Even the United Kingdom, with the sixth-largest GDP, contributes only 1 per cent to global CO2. Though it may appear meritorious to act locally while imagining a global impact, the facts are not supportive. Arguably, the alternative to 'free riding' should be global cooperation. For countries of the Global South covered in Eberhard and Kruger's work, investing in renewable energy will have no measurable impact upon atmospheric CO2 or prevent climate change. If the incentives and subsidies being offered to developing countries to adopt renewable technologies in general were instead directed to the world's most-emitting sectors, there would be greater CO2 reduction at a lower cost. A global agreement on the taxation of CO2 might be one approach (Shackleton, 2020), and, in contrast to technology-specific incentives, taxing carbon ensures that firms and sectors with the lowest costs of abatement act first. In contrast, offering incentives for renewable energy, grid-level battery storage or carbon sequestration involves governments picking winners – Hayek's 'pretence of knowledge'. Moreover, disaggregating the effects of policies from general economic trends is challenging and assumption-intensive (Moutinho et al., 2015). Perhaps these authors should recall the observation of the late Professor Milton Friedman: "One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results."6 Apart from achieving COP objectives, the economic case for investing in renewable energy in the Global South remains questionable especially given its minuscule contribution to global CO2. Even in Europe, independently pursuing COP objectives may appear environmentally virtuous, but is devoid of economic common sense. Altogether, it echoes Marx's mantra: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.' From pre-industrial times to the 1950s, global levels of atmospheric CO2 hovered around 300 parts per million or 0.03 per cent of the atmosphere. It has now grown to around 400 parts per million or 0.04 per cent of the atmosphere. Though CO2, as a by-product of the chemical reaction known as combustion, was never a concern until it was associated with climate change, the replacement of technologies using fossil fuels with renewable energy technologies is commonly portrayed as a 'win-win', that is, the costs of climate change are averted, and it is better and cheaper than fossil fuels. In all three works, in both presumptions and overt claims, it is argued that the cost of energy will be reduced through reliance upon solar PV and wind-turbine generated electricity. Hathry makes this claim in his chapter 3. Eberhard and Kruger's collection tells us that the reliance upon market mechanisms has facilitated investment and provided cost-efficient electricity tariffs for the provision of clean, renewably generated electricity. According to the authors in the Eberhard and Kruger collection, the criterion for successful implementation of renewable energy is that an independent power project is built and achieves 'commercial' operation in a timely manner and offers a low, competitive price of electricity, critically defined using the metric of the IEA and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The indirect 'ancillary' costs of providing system balancing and backup as well as network costs are mentioned along with their inevitable 'socialisation', that is, the impact upon consumers, but considered in depth. According to the various contributors, renewable energy is successful if the agreed tariff price is similar to or slightly below the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of the relevant technology, that is, wind turbines or solar.7 But does this criterion measure ensure economic merit? Properly, the use of this criterion ensures only that the prices received by investors–developers of renewable energy reflect their respective costs including an adequate return to capital; it does not imply that such a price will be cheaper, the same as, or more expensive than other forms of electricity generation, like dispatchable fossil-fuel plants or nuclear (US EIA, 2022). To elaborate, while renewable energy is often presented as competitive with fossil-fuel-fired electricity generation, this assertion confuses price per installed megawatt with price per megawatt hour, as determined through the aforementioned LCOE calculation. Remember, though its 'fuel' is free, the significant capital requirements are not. Moreover, even in sunny Africa or Brazil, solar PV does not work at night. In most parts of the world, on-shore wind operates approximately one-quarter of the time and off-shore wind about a third of the time. For heuristic purposes, if we assume a weighted capacity average of 25 per cent, we might imagine that constructing four times capacity would yield nearly the same output of one gas-fired turbine normally operating at a typical load factor of 90 per cent. The observation, however, assumes zero correlation between the four sites. Weather patterns are not uncorrelated, requiring instead that one might need a sixfold investment in wind or solar renewable capacity to generate as much electricity as a single gas turbine of the same megawatts. So, while the price of installed capacity has fallen for renewable technology, an LCOE-type calculation of dividing the cost of capacity by the number of hours to reach an average cost, shows that renewable energy is not cheap. Even with Pigouvian-style taxation of CO2 and other effluents, if it were technologically superior to dispatchable plant like combined-cycle gas turbines and ultra-supercritical coal, debating how it should be supported would be a moot issue. Comparing LCOE of various forms of generation, however, does not tell the whole story of their respective merits. Though the authors of the Eberhard and Kruger collection acknowledge the indirect costs of renewable energy investment and that such costs may be 'socialised' (that is, paid for by consumers), the matter is given limited attention. It cannot be ignored, however. In the Del Río and Ragwitz collection, such topics are explored in depth. In chapter 2, titled 'The Costs and Benefits of the Energy Transition', by Barbara Breitschopf, Julia Panny and Anne Held, we have a detailed analysis and explanation of why renewable energy has huge indirect costs. Further, in chapter 8, titled 'The Grid Costs of Renewable Energy Deployment', by Joan Batalla-Bejerano, Daniel Davi-Arderius and Elisa Trujillo-Baute, we find a detailed explanation and analysis of the infrastructure needed to make renewable energy generation workable. We learn that, as a highly distributed form of electricity generation, it requires vast investment in transmission cables estimated to cost for overhead lines approximately £600,000 per kilometre, ignoring life-cycle costs. Further, it requires fossil-fuel plants idling at minimum stable generation to be dispatchable when the wind-generated output fails and the sun does not shine. In the UK, according to the energy regulator Ofgem, the non-wholesale cost component of retail energy prices now exceeds 71 per cent.8 The costs of random intermittency associated with renewable technologies cannot be overestimated. Argentina has 2,534 hours per year of sunshine; 71 per cent of the time it is either night or under cloud cover. India has 2,361; 73 per cent of the time it is either night or under cloud cover. Even in Zambia, 68 per cent of the time cloud and nightfall may render solar PV infrastructure useless. Though it may be observed that in parts of Africa and India renewable energy will be a primary source of electricity without grid-level backup, making it cheaper, it is still hard to imagine anyone being satisfied with an intermittent and unpredictable supply. While in Argentina, South Africa and Brazil consumers living in urbanised areas expect reliable supply, renewable energy will require fossil-fuel backup or massive investment in grid-level storage, both of which impose huge social costs.9 Turning to Europe, it has been estimated that providing dispatchable backup to intermittent renewable energy is costing tens of billions of euros per annum (Haar & Haar, 2017). According to recently published data by the IEA at the University of Cologne, Germany faces a €60 billion funding gap in its support for renewable energy and will need to spend about €10 billion of that on new gas-fired and hydrogen backup plants when low wind speeds or clouds keep windmills and solar panels from contributing to the grid. Further, for Germany, the social costs of reaching net zero by 2030 are estimated to reach €1.9 trillion, or €240 billion per year.10 To summarise, only one of the three publications provides realistic insights into what transitioning to renewable generation of electricity will cost. 'Socialisation' of indirect costs may sound inoffensive, but when one quantifies the facts the case for using renewables to decarbonise electricity generation is undermined, especially in the lower- and middle-income countries of the Global South. From a democratic governance perspective, one wonders how citizens of the Global South would respond if they were canvassed on the trade-offs in transitioning to renewable energy. As we have witnessed in the world's most advanced economies, since the Industrial Revolution economic growth has been supported through inexpensive fossil fuels. Viewed comprehensively, the cost of energy will not be reduced through reliance upon solar PV and wind-turbine-generated electricity, and reliance upon it in developing countries will not make them richer. If it were economic to generate electricity using renewable technology rather than natural gas, petroleum or coal, it would not need policy advocacy; businesses do not require incentives to pursue profits. Reflecting the widespread transition to the privatisation of electricity generation from state-owned utilities and the use of market forces to deliver reliable and affordable electricity, in all three works reviewed a large role is accorded to private investors and capital in achieving the transition to wind and solar renewable-electricity generation. Hathry targets private entities and addresses how renewable energy projects may be undertaken at firm level. He discusses how to measure energy consumption and the potential savings from renewable energy. Unsurprisingly, the public relations benefits of using and generating renewable energy are also emphasised. A case study in Hathry's work of the major French conglomerate the Bollore Group demonstrates the alleged benefits in this regard. Lacking, however, in Hathry's work are the larger financial-economic as well as macro insights. It may look good to customers for a firm to signal its virtue of being conscientiously green, but how could higher energy prices really be good for stakeholders if it increases costs? The ultimate incidence must impact consumers, shareholders and employees. Further, we have the burden of the indirect costs of renewably generated electricity, as already explained. In most cases firms are receiving tax credits, subsidies, and other inducements to use or adopt renewable energy. Such incentives have a cost: a subsidy for one entity means higher taxes for another entity. Such incentives may have misallocative effects, directing capital in a suboptimal manner. Commenting upon the upcoming Davos Meeting, the President and CEO of Huntsman Corporation, a publicly traded petrochemical manufacturer, said "the pursuit of green energy is leading to the rapid de-industrialisation of Europe" (Huntsman, 2024). The German think tank Agora Energiewende (2024) reported that the fall in Europe's CO2 output is primarily due to deindustrialisation. Promoting one's green credentials might yield positive public perceptions, but the costs lead to economic stagnation. Major European car makers have already voiced concerns that the battery-powered vehicle will be the death of the domestic car industry (Fairless, 2024). In addition, Hathry's perspective ignores the impact upon consumers. Higher prices for domestic energy and transportation reduce the purchasing power of consumers, which cannot be good for businesses. Discretionary consumer purchases such as clothing, hospitality, entertainment have been affected by higher energy prices. In the UK thousands of pubs have shut their doors, blaming the cost of heating (Cobham, 2024). Taking a general equilibrium perspective, apart from the direct beneficiaries of renewable energy investments such as investors earning low-risk subsidised returns, through altering relative prices from their natural opportunity cost and directing capital to where it would not go without incentives, the promotion of renewable energy must have a net negative impact to a country. Even arguments with respect to job creation through renewable energy require major qualifications (Stanef-Puica et al., 2022). Chapter 7 in the Del Río and Ragwitz collection ('Green Jobs in the Spanish Renewable Energy Sector: An Input-Output Approach' by Manuel Tomás, Ignacio Cazcarro, Julen Montilla, Cristina Pizarro-Irizar and Iñaki Arto) shows the challenges of measuring the employment impact of renewable energy programmes. Simple mantras claiming that supporting renewable energy will create 'green jobs' are not useful. Like many targeted government programmes, identifying the cohort of beneficiaries is easier than showing the widespread negative impact upon contributors and payers. Cynically, such benefits are transitory while the costs, like deindustrialisation and impoverishment, are persistent, difficult to measure and beyond the election cycle. Though Hathry's observations are of a general nature, the focus of the many authors in the Eberhard and Kruger collection is on how the use of energy auctions may encourage private investors in renewable energy, particularly in the nations of the Global South. Covering Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, India, South Africa, Zambia and Namibia, the respective authors, as area experts, provide detailed and well-explained information on the design, implementation, and outcomes of renewable energy auctions in each of these important locations. Each country-specific chapter provides a mixture of facts, casual empiricism and contextual information on the structure and performance of the existing power generation sector. The detailed information is generously supported by excellent graphs, tables and other exhibits, giving the reader useful insights into how each of these countries sought to address inadequate electricity supply through reliance upon market mechanisms and private capital. The information supplied and observations made do not demonstrate the economic rationality of these investment programmes. From this work, we learn that renewable energy auctions have become the main approach to contracting utility-scale renewable energy projects. The recent history of auction markets in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and India are appraised and analysed with the aim of improving how they are designed and implemented globally. In each country the focus is on policy choices including how the auction was implemented, what institutions were involved and how the procurement process was undertaken. After decades of reliance upon state-owned or parastatal entities, for all these countries turning to the private sector to supply electricity and relying upon a market mechanism to set the price was a watershed. As a natural monopoly suitable for either public ownership or regulated private ownership, there was a history of antipathy to using the private sector to supply electricity and a market mechanism to set prices. As we learn from Eberhard and Kruger's collection, in some countries private investment focusing upon renewable energy was intended to address chronic load-shedding and deficient performance of the established state-owned monopoly. In India, we discover that the auction process initially was complicated by the autonomy of India's state authorities, but eventually the ambitions to reduce the cost of renewable energy, to attract investors and have projects completed in a timely manner were successful. Facilitating India's programme was the socialisation of direct and indirect system support cost; rather than imposing such costs upon developers, a 'plug-and-play' option for developers: government agencies provided land and transmission connection. In some countries, conditions were already favourable to using private capital and auctions to facilitate renewable energy development; in other countries, new laws, regulations and institution were required. In Chile, we learn that the combination of a positive business climate, low country risk, low non-payment rates and a supportive regulatory system helped to protect revenue streams to suppliers. With advanced capital markets and economic sophistication, successful auctions of the right to build and generate renewable electricity in South Africa should have been straightforward, but attracting private sector investment faced several obstacles. Though South Africa had been the regional leader in renewable energy auctions, establishing the Independent Power Producer Programme in late 2010 to address chronic power shortages as well as demonstrating commitment to UN Climate Change Conference (COP 15), its site selection process was cumbersome and costly for unsuccessful bidders. Further, its compliance programme was complicated while bidder ranking and winner selection was insufficiently transparent, discouraging investors from future rounds. In countries such as Brazil and Mexico, major structural reforms of the electricity sector, including vertical unbundling of supply from transmission and distribution, were needed to provide suitable and attractive conditions for private investors. In Mexico, an energy regulator was created along with a market operator, and the state-owned utility was segmented into independent entities overseeing various parts of the value chain. In Argentina, the long history of economic instability and institutional fragility presented obstacles necessitating the creation of trust fund by the World Bank to mitigate financial risk to investors. It was successful in facilitating auctions until the crash of 2018 proved it was insufficient to protect investors from sovereign risk. In Namibia, starting from a complete absence of private sector involvement in electricity supply as of 2015, tangible progress was made using innovative financial structures developed by the Standard Bank to lend in the local currency, shielding investors from foreign exchange-rate risk. In neighbouring Zambia, an innovative approach to auction design was used to mitigate key risks and build trust among potential investors. In sum, from the collection we learn that renewable energy auctions have become the dominant method for contracting utility-scale renewable energy projects, in large part due to the 'cost-efficient' tariffs secured through this method. Relying upon private capital and market mechanisms, progress in renewable energy by the countries of the Global South has been remarkable, but does this tell the entire story? While these countries have used a market mechanism to encourage renewable energy investment and relied upon the private sector to build renewable generation, often using the LCOE for renewables as a benchmark for setting prices of renewables, this does not necessarily demonstrate sound economics. The authors in the Eberhard and Kruger collection avoid the salient issue of whether promoting renewable energy, even using market mechanisms, favours prosperity, growth and development. In seeking guidance from this publication, policymakers should reflect carefully. Though encouraging investment in renewable energy through auctions supports achieving COP 15 objectives, the authors in the Eberhard and Kruger collection ignore the issue of whether it supports long-term economic growth and development in their respective economies. Does it build wealth or just encourage rent-seeking? In addition to gas-fired generation being cheaper when considered comprehensively, the geography and geology of these countries makes one wonder why they should pursue renewable energy, if not for achieving UN sustainable development goals or finding favour with NGOs. Argentina, as mentioned, has huge exploitable natural gas and oil reserves. So does Brazil.11 Mexico produces over 1.7 mmbd of oil and ranks just ahead of Brazil in having 16,549,000 mmcf of gas reserves. Angola, the northern neighbour of Namibia, has 9,711,000 mmcf of gas reserves and produces 1.4 mmbd of oil. Though Zambia has a tiny oil and gas industry, its neighbour Mozambique is estimated to have 100 million mmcf of gas reserves, ranking 14th in the world. Altogether, the plentiful supply of hydrocarbons suitable for gas-fired electricity generation, either within or available from neighbouring countries, raises the question of whether unreliable distributed generation of electricity makes sense. The LCOE may be comparable, but it still requires massive investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure as well as dispatchable backup. For long-term economic growth, would renewable energy in the countries of the Global South, or anywhere for that matter, make sense if we were not concerned with the impact of using fossil fuels to generate electricity? While all the authors in Eberhard and Kruger's collection acknowledge that renewable energy has ancillary and network costs, they all seem complacent about the above concerns. Yes, according to Deason (2018) in a meta-analysis of 45 peer-reviewed studies on the impact of renewable energy, 34 found that full reliance upon renewable energy would increase electricity prices between 41 per cent and 104 per cent. More broadly, according to Alex Epstein (2021), replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will condemn much of the developing world to eternal poverty. Apart from achieving COP objectives, the economic case for pursuing renewable energy in the Global South remains questionable especially given its minuscule contribution to global CO2. Perhaps reflecting the level of governance and democracy, the various governments covered by Eberhard and Kruger appear committed to increasing renewable energy output without regard for the costs imposed on consumers of electricity and the long-term implications for economic growth. This also raises the question of how well the citizens of Europe and North America appreciate the negative impact of eliminating fossil fuels from electricity generation. Reflecting the commitments to the COP/renewable energy agenda, researchers from policy institutes, leading academic institutions and elsewhere have devoted great effort to explaining the economic benefits of transitioning to 'renewable' energy and pursuing the commitments made under the auspices of the UN climate change agreements. The three works reviewed here offer detailed insights and advice on how the transition may be facilitated. Intended for policymakers and academics, the two edited collections are by far the most rigorous, with the one edited by Pablo Del Río and Mario Ragwitz the most balanced, offering detailed insights into the costs of transforming how we generate electricity as well as such key topics as employment creation. The collection edited by the University of Cape Town professors Anton Eberhard and Wikus Kruger provides detailed insights into how various countries of the Global South have used market mechanisms and private capital to engender renewable investment. Notwithstanding the use of market mechanisms, whether such policies and programmes are beneficial, offering sound economics, is given limited emphasis. The shorter work of Georges Hathry has a different audience: the business executive wishing to know more about renewable energy and why his or her firm should become engaged. It is uncritical and limited in its outlook, but the case studies are interesting, providing guidance on how and why one should proceed. In sum, short of a technological breakthrough like sustainable fusion energy, these works show that the devotion to renewable energy may require more faith than rationality. Perhaps we should recall the words of the Spanish poet Miguel de Unamuno: 'Faith which does not doubt is dead faith.'

<p><strong>Climate change is causing rapid changes in reef structure, biodiversity, and function as a response to ocean warming and acidification. The negative impacts of climate change on corals are well-documented, but most sponges are predicted to tolerate conditions projected for 2100, making them a viable option for stable alternative reef states. Sponges maintain an intimate relationship with microbial communities, whose general stability in a given sponge species makes them suitable indicators of host responses to stressful environmental conditions such as ocean warming and acidification. The overall aim of this thesis is to examine the impacts of climate change on sponges and their associated microbial communities, with a focus on microbial community composition and abundance and sponge protein expression.</strong></p><p>The first data chapter examines the results from a reciprocal transplantation of the coral reef sponges Coelocarteria singaporensis and Stylissa cf. flabelliformis between a control reef site and an adjacent CO2 vent site in Papua New Guinea to explore how the sponge microbiome responds to ocean acidification in situ. Microbial communities of C. singaporensis, which differed initially between sites, did not shift towards characteristic control or vent microbiomes. Microbial communities of S. cf. flabelliformis, which were initially stable between sites, did not respond specifically to transplantation but collectively exhibited a significant change over time, with a relative increase in Thaumarchaeota and decrease in Proteobacteria in all treatment groups. The lack of a community shift upon transplantation to the vent site suggests that microbial flexibility, at least in the adult life-history stage, does not necessarily underpin host survival under ocean acidification.</p><p>The second data chapter compares the symbiotic microbial community composition of tropical sponge Stylissa flabelliformis after an eight-week exposure to nine different treatments of three temperatures (28.5 °C, 30 °C, 31.5 °C) and three pH levels (8.1, 7.8, 7.6) based on ambient conditions and two IPCC predictions of future ocean conditions (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). Bacterial communities differed significantly between temperature treatments, but not pH, with the highest temperature treatments showing increased relative abundances of Bacteroidia and Clostridia (commonly associated with sponge disease and thermal stress), and decreased relative abundances of Nitrospira (associated with nitrogen cycling). Similarly, archaeal communities differed significantly across temperature, with a relative decrease in Nitrososphaeria (associated with ammonia oxidation). Symbiotic eukaryotes were compared using three different reference databases and only two treatments (28.5 °C, pH 8.1 and 31.5 °C, pH 7.6) and exhibited a significant difference in community composition between the two treatments, but also highlighted the requirement for more thorough reference databases. Overall, there was a clear change with temperature across all three microbial groups, indicating increased stress and potential hindrance of nutrient cycling.</p><p>The third data chapter aims to determine the impact of temperature and pH on the abundance and spatial arrangement of sponge-associated microbes using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Total bacterial abundance was not significantly different across temperature or pH, but was unexpectedly high in sponge replicates with notable algal growth and tissue necrosis. Archaea differed significantly with temperature, decreasing in abundance with increasing temperature, but exhibited no changes due to pH. FISH was largely unsuccessful, due primarily to high sponge autofluorescence and a very low concentration of archaea in the sponge tissue (as shown with ddPCR). Regardless, shifts in bacterial abundance with reduced sponge health and archaeal abundance with temperature show signs of stress and potential functional implications.</p><p>The fourth data chapter uses proteomic analysis to examine shifts in protein expression due to temperature and pH. High-temperature treatments exhibited an increased expression of proteins associated with heat shock and a decreased expression of proteins associated with oxidative stress, actin-related processes, and smooth muscle contraction in comparison to low-temperature treatments. The comparison of high- and low-pH treatments resulted in only two significant and annotated proteins associated with biological processes. Oxidation stress exhibited higher expression at pH 7.6 while smooth muscle contraction exhibited lower expression at pH 7.6. Overall, a decrease in the expression of important functions such as reduction of oxidative stress and smooth muscle contraction indicate negative impacts of thermal stress on S. flabelliformis.</p><p>Overall, sponges are expected to be more resilient under climate change conditions than calcifying organisms such as corals. Although low pH produced little response in the sponge holobiont, S. flabelliformis exhibits a temperature threshold of approximately 31.5 °C. At this temperature, microbial community composition and protein expression shift with negative implications for the functional roles of sponges.</p>

Liquid metals—that is, metals with low melting points—have fascinating and unique properties. Gallium is one of the most popular liquid metals because it melts near room temperature, has low toxicity, effectively zero vapor pressure, and can be combined with other metals to form alloys. The term "liquid metal" can be more broadly defined to include metals that melt at temperatures that are easy to access under common laboratory conditions. Room-temperature liquid metals open unique possibilities to leverage the soft, fluidic characteristics of liquids while simultaneously taking advantage of properties like high surface energy and thin oxide layers, high electrical and thermal conductivity, and other metallic characteristics that are typically reserved for rigid, solid materials. This liquid-metallic combination has resulted in remarkable properties, unusual behaviors, and new materials and devices that cannot be created with typical fluids or common metals alone. Interest in liquid metals has grown over the last decade due to the interest in applications that take advantage of their properties. For example, liquid metals can be used as conductors and components in soft and stretchable electronics. Likewise, they can be used for soft biomedical devices, energy harvesting devices, and e-textiles. Liquid metals can help catalyze reactions in unique ways and have interfacial properties that can be exploited for a variety of applications, such as actuators, batteries, and substrates for the deposition of thin films. The versatility of liquid metals presents many opportunities for future materials, devices, and systems, and represents an exciting paradigm for both scientific exploration and the creation of novel technologies. The special issue on Liquid Metals for Functional Materials consists of 49 manuscripts with 37 research articles and 12 reviews across a wide breadth of the liquid metal field. The work focuses on the latest advancements from fundamental properties to applied concepts, as broadly classified as Energy and Electrochemistry, Biomedical and Healthcare, Catalysts and Reactions, Composites and Multiphase Materials, Electronics and Conductors, Fabrication and Patterning, and Interfacial Properties. This collection highlights the multidisciplinary nature of liquid metal research and provides a platform to showcase our current understanding and outline future directions. We sincerely thank Dr. Joseph Krumpfer and Dr. Esther Levy, whose dedication to this special issue energized this effort and led to the exciting collection of papers presented in this special issue. Below, we will briefly highlight the contents of the special issue through the lens of several of the key subtopics in the field. Liquid metals offer promising potential in future energy storage and harvesting. Their electrical conductivity, deformability, compatibility with electrochemistry, lithium dissolution capability, and the possibility of creating porous composites make them ideal materials for efficient ion and electron exchanges. The addition of small metallic components can significantly alter the electrochemical behavior of liquid metals. In a work published in this special issue, Tang and co-workers showed the modulation of electrochemical properties by studying fractals that are formed from liquid metal alloys (adfm.202301348). In another work, Li and co-workers presented mixtures of MXene with EGaIn for energy-harvesting (adfm.202307830). Additionally, Boley and co-workers created a galvanic cell by mechanically rupturing surface oxide of liquid metals to convert chemical energy to electrical energy (adfm.202309177). Quality of electrical conductivity and stretchability are important factors in textile-based electronics with embedded supercapacitors, which are carefully investigated in another work by So and co-workers (adfm.202310318). An interesting paper by Deng and co-workers presented the application of liquid metals for forming elastomer seals in stretchable lithium-ion storage units (adfm.202309861). Finally, the special issue includes a review by Yan and co-workers on advances in energy storage based on liquid metal systems (adfm.202309706). The low toxicity of gallium-based liquid metals makes them suitable for medical applications. The use of liquid metals in these areas has been growing in popularity, and this issue features several papers that review recent biomedicine-related liquid metal works. For example, one paper by Seo and co-workers summarized the use of low-melting-point metals for biomedical applications (adfm.202307708). One paper by Park and co-workers reviewed the usage of gallium-based liquid metals for bioelectronics (adfm.202307990) while another paper by Lim and co-workers reviewed healthcare-related applications of liquid metals in wearables and soft robotics (adfm.202309989). Additionally, Wei and co-workers reviewed liquid metal-based biosensors (adfm.202308173). In more specific applications, Truong and co-workers created silver-gallium amalgamated particles that show antibacterial properties and show promise as a spray-coating on implantable devices (adfm.202310539). In another work by Markvicka and co-workers, composites of elastomers and liquid metals were developed with acoustic properties that improve the image quality of wearable ultrasound devices for long-term patient monitoring (adfm.202308954). Additionally, liquid-metal electrodes and particles were used by Kim and co-workers to create soft biosensors capable of detecting ascorbic and uric acid, dopamine, and glucose (adfm.202311696). Currently, a significant portion of global greenhouse emissions and energy consumption stems from industrial-scale chemical reactions used in the production of ammonia, fuel, hydrogen, polymers, and other chemicals. Progress in enhancing catalysis and reaction rates using solid materials has been limited. Exploring the untapped properties of liquid metals holds great promise for introducing new paradigms in these chemical processes. Researchers offered several interesting works in this special issue on catalysts and reactions using liquid metals. Here, Daeneke and co-workers showed a delicate liquid metal system with incorporated copper for electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol (adfm.202304248). Kalantar-Zadeh and co-workers demonstrated that liquid metal can be used as the reservoir for zinc metal for sourcing it into the synthesis metal–organic frameworks (adfm.202300969). While another study put forward by Yarema and co-workers presented an approach to use liquid metal to create Pd-Zn nanocrystals (adfm.202309018). In another seminal manuscript, Sitti and co-workers utilized liquid metal initiated polymerization to create hydrogel composites (adfm.202308238). A liquid metal reaction media was also used by Zavabeti and co-workers for the creation of atomically thin bismuth oxides that enabled strong piezoelectric systems (adfm.202307348). O'Mullane and co-workers showed that liquid metals have a potential use in plasma-assisted carbon dioxide reduction by incorporating liquid metal droplets (adfm.202307846). The capabilities of liquid metals are not just limited to inorganic systems. Miyako and co-workers showed that liquid metal catalysts can also be effectively used in immunostimulants (adfm.202305886). Liquid metal can be combined with diverse components such as polymers, metals, carbon-based materials, or other organic or inorganic materials to create composites and multiphase systems. This can create novel composites with enhanced functional or mechanical properties relative to solid-based inclusions or other phases can be added into liquid metal to provide new properties not native to liquid metal. These concepts were well captured in the special issue. One review by Kramer-Bottiglio and co-workers focused on multiphase composites containing liquid metal and other (x) fillers for unique combinations of properties (adfm.202309529) while another review by Lee and co-workers showed how adding particles into liquid metal can create magnetic liquid metal (adfm.202311153). A third review by Tee and co-workers discussed liquid metal composites for wearable electronics (adfm.202400284). Additionally, a set of papers presented liquid-metal polymer composites with different functionalities. One work by Bartlett and co-workers showed how liquid-metal droplets in elastomers could create electrically conductive reversible adhesives for soft electronics (adfm.202304101), while another by Li and co-workers showed hydrogel composites with high toughness and conductivity (adfm.202308113). This polymer composite architecture also enabled thermally stable soft materials for high-temperature applications as presented by Majidi and co-workers (adfm.202309725) while Zhou and co-workers used liquid metal droplets as cross-links to enable recyclable conductive composites (adfm.202308032). The high deformability of liquid metal wires was also used in conjunction with a magnetic soft composite by Park and co-workers to create artificial muscles (adfm.202302895). Like solid metals, liquid metals have a high electrical conductivity, making them suitable as conductors in electronics, but with the added properties of liquids, such as discretization into droplets. One review by Hussain and co-workers examined liquid-metal droplets and their use for electronics such as sensors, switches, transistors, actuators, and more (adfm.202308116). Liquid metals are also especially suitable for soft, flexible, and stretchable electronics. Toward this, Zhang and co-workers created a soft, lightweight composite with networks of liquid-metal fibers (adfm.202308128) while Zhang and co-workers developed liquid-metal composite materials that show increased conductivity with applied strain (adfm.202310225). In another contribution, Zheng and co-workers demonstrated a permeable and stretchable liquid-metal fibers for sensors and other electronics (adfm.202308120). Bartlett and co-workers presented a liquid metal-based conductive adhesive for integration of soft electronics and rigid devices (adfm.202313567) while Hjort and co-workers presented a laser engraving methodology for creating liquid metal-based interconnects (adfm.202309707). Other papers in this issue describe the use of liquid metals in specific electronic devices. One review presented by Park and co-workers examined liquid-metal systems that respond to a variety of stimuli, and that can be used for electronics such as wearable sensors (adfm.202308703). The compliant nature of liquid metal was used by Lacour and co-workers to make sensors that can measure softness (adfm.202308698). A liquid-metal inductive sensor was created by Jeong and co-workers that is capable of distinguishing between various stimuli on a finger (adfm.202305776), and a wearable liquid-metal antenna was directly printed by Hashimoto and co-workers (adfm.202311219). Liquid metals can be patterned into useful shapes such as circuits, antennas, and wires to create soft and stretchable analogs to existing electronic devices. Relative to conventional metals, such as copper or aluminum, the fluidic nature of liquid metal allows it to be patterned in unique ways, including injection and 3D printing. In many cases, patterning is facilitated by the thin, solid oxide layer that forms rapidly on the surface of liquid metals in the presence of oxygen. This solid oxide "skin" allows the liquid metal to retain shapes that would normally be impossible with liquids due to surface tension. This special issue offers several interesting works on the fabrication and patterning of liquid metals. Liquid metals were 3D printed in ceramics by Yang and co-workers for use in microwave absorption (adfm.202307499). In another example, Syed and co-workers separated the oxide layer from the liquid metal to enable the fabrication of gas sensors (adfm.202309342). Park and co-workers also took advantage of the ability to use liquid metal particles to pattern stretchable electronics (adfm.202309660). The particles can be used to make thermally conductive composites as demonstrated by Lee and co-workers (adfm.202306698) or be cast as a film and subsequently merged together to form conductive traces as presented by Dickey and co-workers (adfm.202308574). Liquid metals have remarkable interfacial properties. For example, they have the largest interfacial tension of any liquid at room temperature, with values nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of water. Yet, the surface tension effectively can be lowered to near zero by using electrochemical oxidation. This phenomenon, as well as several others, can be used to control the flow and shape of liquid metal, as reviewed by Wang and co-workers in this special issue (adfm.202309614). In addition, studies by Daniels and co-workers provide new insights into this electrochemical phenomenon by carefully measuring the tension as a function of electrical potential (adfm.202311501) or by confining the metal to porous tubes as demonstrated by Khan and co-workers (adfm.202307919). Another interesting property of liquid metals is that they can react to form surface oxides on their surface. Herein, Tabor and co-workers enhance the mechanical strength of the skin by depositing thin silica layers on the oxide (adfm.202308167). Further, Elbourne and co-workers evaluated the structure of the oxide on liquid metal droplets (adfm.202310147) while Koo and co-workers utilized the oxide-coated liquid metal to form more stable solar cells (adfm.202311597). We are grateful for all the authors, reviewers, and editors who made this special issue possible. We hope this special issue will help highlight the challenges and exciting opportunities for the development and utilization of liquid metal in diverse applications.

 BACKGROUND Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma that primarily arises within or after the germinal center[1]. While Burkitt’s lymphoma is considered rare in China, it constitutes 30%-50% of childhood tumors in Africa, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO)[2, 3]. Unfortunately, the incidence of this condition has been steadily increasing, posing a significant threat to human health[4]. It should be emphasized that a significant number of individuals diagnosed with Burkitt’s lymphoma are already in the advanced stages of the disease (stages III to IV) when they seek medical attention[5]. Although chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment, the effectiveness of medical treatments and predicted outcomes for individuals with advanced-stage illnesses and refractory recurrence are far from satisfactory[6, 7]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further research on the pathogenesis of Burkitt’s lymphoma, with a focus on identifying potential therapeutic targets via gateway molecules. EBV infection plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of BL, exerting a profound influence on the development of B-cell malignancy[8, 9]. Based on clinical manifestations, geographical distribution, infection patterns, and immune status, BL has been categorized into three distinct subtypes by WHO: endemic (Burkitt’s lymphoma), sporadic (Burkitt’s lymphoma), and immunodeficient-associated (ID-Burkitt’s lymphoma)[10]. EBV is found in approximately 95% of eBurkitt lymphoma cases, 20%-30% of sBurkitt lymphoma cases, and 25%-40% of ID-Burkitt lymphoma cases[11, 12]. Notably, nearly 100% of children with endemic BL demonstrate the existence of EBV infection[13, 14]. Nevertheless, the exact function of EBV infection in the cause of BL is still not be fully elucidated. EBV is the first virus to possess microRNAs (miRNAs) in its genome. These mature miRNAs are primarily encoded by two gene groups, namely, BamHI Fragment H Rightward Open Reading Frame 1 (BHRF1) and BamHI-A Region Rightward Transcript (BART). BHRF1 encodes only four miRNAs, whereas the remaining miRNAs are encoded by BARTs[15, 16]. The BART gene contains 22 precursor miRNAs (miR-BART 1-22), which can generate 44 mature miRNAs, all of which are highly expressed in EBV-associated lymphoma[17]. Studies have shown that in Akata cells, miR-BART10-3p[18] can target BHRF1, inhibit EBV replication and B lymphocytes, and reduce immune clearance. Additionally, EBV can directly or indirectly affect various tumor-related genes, such as the BIM tumor suppressor gene and the TCL-1 oncogene, in B lymphocytes, contributing to its carcinogenic role [19-22]. Zhang et al. found that EBV-miR-BART6-3p and miR-197 had a synergistic effect on reducing IL-6R in Burkitt lymphoma[23, 24]. Another study discovered that miR-BART6-3p can downregulate PTEN to encourage the growth of EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells [25]. Furthermore, in Burkitt lymphoma cells (Raji), miR-BART20-5P can silence the BCL-2 related death promoter BAD gene, leading to anti-apoptotic effects [26]. The abnormal expression of EBV-miRNA-BARTs in Burkitt lymphoma suggests their crucial role in tumorigenesis and development[27-29]. Yet, in regards to Burkitt lymphoma, the specific mechanisms of action and target genes controlled by these miRNAs have not been thoroughly investigated. The cell cycle is the basic process of cell life activities, which includes two stages, cell division and cell growth, and is crucial for cell growth, division, and repair[30]. The regulatory mechanisms of the cell cycle are complex and involve the interaction of multiple genes and proteins, including CDK1 and cyclinD1[31, 32]. EBV is closely associated with the cell cycle[33]. Some studies have pointed out that EBV can also regulate the latent genes required for B-cell immortalization, thus affecting the cell cycle[34]. Therefore, an in-depth study of the relationship between EBV and the cell cycle is helpful to explore the pathogenesis of EBV infection-related diseases and to provide new ideas for treatment.   OBJECTIVE Background: EB virus infection runs through the entire process of B-cell malignant Burkitt lymphoma. The role of EBV-miRNA-BART5-3p has been investigated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric cancer, but has not been studied in Burkitt lymphoma. The primary aim of this study was to explore the impact of EBV-miRNA-BART5-3p on the progression of Burkitt lymphoma. Methods: We observed the upregulation of EBV-miR-BART5-3p in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cells using a range of methodologies, including the use of a bioinformatics tool, real-time PCR, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry analysis. The effects and underlying mechanisms of BART5-3p in Burkitt’s lymphoma were further investigated through exogenous overexpression or inhibition in cells. Results: In this study, we detected BART5-3p was highly expressed and decrease P53 levels in Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells. A higher level of BART5-3p can downregulate P53 and is significantly associated with cell proliferation. In addition, flow cytometry analysis revealed that BART5-3p may regulate the cell cycle of Burkitt lymphoma cells by downregulating P53 through the flow cytometry analysis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that EBV-miR-BART5-3p contributes to dysregulation of the cell cycle and proliferation in Burkitt’s lymphoma cells by directly downregulating P53, thereby providing a potential prognostic target for EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma patients.   METHODS Cell line and cell culture Two EBV-negative BL cell lines were obtained from Shanghai Fuheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and Henan Engineering Research Center of Industrial Microbiology, respectively, and named Ramos and CA46. The EBV-positive BL cell line Raji was purchased from the Cell Bank of the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). HEK293T cells were originally obtained from Guangzhou Cellcook Biotech Co., Ltd. and were grown in a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Every Green, Zhejiang, China) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; BasalMedia). The other cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 (BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Target estimation Employing accession number NM_000546.6, the TP53 sequence utilized to predict miRNA targets was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). EBV-miRNA-BART5-3p sequence was obtained from miRBase (MIMAT0009205). The RNAhybrid program (http://bibiserv. techfak. uni-biele. org. de/rnahybrid/) was used to estimate the relationship and minimum energy-free hybridization of miRNAs and target RNAs. Lentivirus transductions Lentiviral particles containing the BART5-3p precursor and related control were provided by Prof. Wenqiang Yu from Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Lentiviral particles were generated using the GV209 plasmid containing the H1-MCS-CMV-EGFP construct. Lentiviral particles were transduced into Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid preparation and cell transfection A TIANprep Midi Plasmid Kit (TIANGEN, China) was used to purify plasmid DNAs. Plasmid DNA (200 ng of plasmid DNA was transfected using Invitrogen's Lipofectamine 2000 reagent in Ramos-BART5-3p and CA46-BART5-3p cells. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were performed to verify the levels of BART5-3p 48 hours after transfection. For the transfection of the BART5-3p inhibitor, P53 inhibitor, and their corresponding negative controls (NCs), cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at an ultimate dosage of 50 nmol/L in serum-free conditions. The medium was replaced with freshly prepared RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum four hours later. The BART5-3p inhibitor and its control, as well as the P53 inhibitor and its control inhibitor (TargetMoI), were purchased from RIBOBIO (Guangzhou, China). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 95% air and 5% CO2. RNA extraction and RT-qPCR Total Ambion's harvested USA the TRIzol reagent (Ambion, total RNA was harvested. MonScriptTM RTLLL ALL-in-One Mix with dsDNase (Monad Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used to synthesize cDNA. MonAmpTM SYBR Green qPCR Mix (Monad Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for RT-qPCR analysis. Supplementary Table 1 includes a list of the primers used for PCR. Except if otherwise noted, the data were first normalized to the level of GAPDH and then to the negative control group. Each reaction was performed three times and again in separate experiments. Relative quantification (2^(− ΔΔCt)) was performed to compute fold-changes. Dual-luciferase reporter assay The day before transfection, the cells were spread in 96-well plates, and on the second day, the cell confluence was approximately 70–80%. The following day, Hieff TransTM, reporter vector, miRNA, and serum-free medium were successively added to 96-well plates; 37℃, 5% CO2 incubator for 6h and replaced with complete medium. The firefly luciferase reaction working solution and arrilla luciferase reaction solution were prepared to detect the viability of firefly luciferase and arrilla luciferase. CCK-8 assay and EdU proliferation assay Following transfection, plates containing 96 wells were seeded at 1x104 cells per well of Ramos, CA46, and Raji cells per well. The Yeasen Biotechnology (Shan) cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) was used to measure cell proliferation. After seeding, 10 mL of CCK-8 solution was added to each well at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, the plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. After incubation, a microplate reader (Thermo MULTISKAN FC) was used to determine the absorbance at 450 nm. Proliferating BL cells were analyzed for EdU incorporation using the C0071 BeyoClickTM EDU-488 Cell Proliferation Assay Kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Transwell assay Transwell chambers with 8 mm pore filters (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) were used to evaluate the migratory ability of cells. BL cells were cultured for 48 h after transfection. Following dissociation, 1×105 cells were reconstituted in serum-free medium and inserted into Transwell chamber inserts, which had 8 µm pores. The testing chambers were then placed in wells filled with media containing 10% FBS. The cells located on the upper surface of the membrane were removed after incubation for 24 h. Cells that had moved to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet Ammonium Oxalate Solution and 1% (Solarbio). Under various microscopic conditions, the moved cells were analyzed in six randomly selected optical fields. Three independent runs were performed for each assay. Cell cycle assay A Cell Cycle Staining kit from MULTI SCIENCES was used for cell cycle detection. Initially, the cells were transfected with miRNA plasmid DNA for 48 h after they were placed into 6-well plates. Following the harvesting of 5x104 cells, 1 ml of 1x Staining buffer was added to the cells. After resuspending the cells, 4 μl of the RedNucleus I staining solution was added to the sample. The samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate and measure the stained cells following the incubation period. Western blotting Western blotting was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protease inhibitors from AbMole BioScience were added to RIPA buffer (high, Solarbio) before cells were harvested and lysed. Next, the proteins were separated using Servicebio SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Once the proteins were separated, they were placed on a PVDF membrane (Pore Size: 0.45um,). Subsequently, the PVDF membrane was examined using an initial antibody and probed with antibodies against p53 (1:10,000; 60283-2-Ig; Proteintech, China), Cyclin D1 (1:10,000; 26939-1-AP; Proteintech, China), GAPDH (1:10,000; 60004-1-Ig; Proteintech, China), and β-actin (1:50,000; 66009-1-Ig; Proteintech, China). A secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase was then used to probe it (SA00001-1; Proteintech, China), and GAPDH and β-actin served as controls for protein loading. To visualize the western blotting bands, a Servicebio Hypersensitive ECL chemiluminescence kit was used. Bands were captured using a ChemiDocTM CRS þ Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad, USA). All blots in the figures were labeled with the locations of the molecular weight/size markers. Statistical analysis. Except as noted otherwise, every experiment was run in triplicate, and the results are displayed as the mean ± s.e.m (standard error of the mean). GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for curve fitting and assessment. A significance threshold of P<0.05 was used to assess the probability of significance. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for all groups. Single, double, and triple asterisks, which represent p-values less than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively, were used to indicate the level of statistical significance.   RESULTS The expression of BART5-3p is upregulated in EBV associated BL cells To investigate the expression level of BART5-3p in BL, the experimental design was determined by performing RT-qPCR analysis of BART5-3p expression in Epstein-Barr virus-negative BL cell lines (Ramos and CA46) and Epstein-Barr virus-positive BL cells (Raji). In contrast to the other two cell lines, Raji cells showed substantially higher levels of BART5-3p expression (Figure 1a). Next, we aimed to upregulate BART5-3p levels in Ramos and CA46 cell lines using liposome-mediated transduction. We successfully generated two stable EBV-negative BL cell lines expressing BART5-3p. The transfection efficiency of BART5-3p in these two cell lines was compared to the control vector using RT-qPCR (Figure 1b), The fluorography after the transfection of BART5-3p was visualized by inverted fluorescence microscopy as shown in Figure 1c. Figure 1 | EBV-miR-BART5-3p was upregulated in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cells. (a) analysis of miR-BART5-3p levels in three cells by RT-qPCR. GAPDH was used as an internal control. (b) statistical analysis of RT-qPCR results showed significantly increased BART5-3p expression in CA46 and Ramos cells after plasmid transfection. (c) the fluorography after the transfection of BART5-3p was visualized by inverted fluorescence microscopy. Values are mean ± SD; * * *: P <0.001. Highly expressed BART5-3p dysregulates the cell cycle enhanced the proliferation of BL cells To assess the effect of BART5-3p on the growth of BL cells, we conducted CCK8 cell proliferation and EdU incorporation assays (Figure 2a and 2b). The results demonstrated that BART5-3p significantly promoted cell proliferation in both the cell lines. Importantly, according to the in vitro migration assays, BART5-3p levels markedly improved the migration of both Ramos-BART5-3p and CA46-BART5-3p compared to the respective negative controls (Figure 2c). Additionally, using flow cytometry, we examined the cell cycle phase in cells with high levels of BART5-3p to determine whether the increased cell growth induced by this substance was associated with cell cycle regulation. Cells overexpressing BART5-3p displayed a longer S phase or G2/M phase in the cell cycle distribution, along with a shorter G0/G1 phase, than the negative control cells (Figure 2d). Remarkably, western blot analysis demonstrated significantly higher protein levels of the cell cycle-related genes cyclinD1, in cells with exogenous BART5-3p expression (Figures 2e). Collectively, these findings imply that BL cell replication is stimulated by BART5-3p, potentially contributing to cancer growth by regulating the cell cycle.

(a-c) The CCK8 cell proliferation assay, EdU incorporation assays and transwell migration assay were used to detect cell proliferation.

EBV-miR-BART5-3p directly downregulates human TP53 gene P53 is a widely recognized gene that acts as a tumor suppressor. It has garnered significant interest for its involvement in the progression of different types of cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma. To investigate the relationship between EBV infection and P53 expression in Burkitt lymphoma, we conducted a comparative analysis of P53 expression levels in normal and Burkitt lymphoma tissue samples using the GEO database (GSE65674 and GSE4464). Based on our analysis, we discovered that, in contrast to normal tissues, P53 level were decreased in BL tissues (Figure 3a). Moreover, we used the CCLE database to examine how EBV infection affected P53 expression in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and confirmed that P53 expression was substantially lower in EBV-infected Raji cells than in EBV-uninfected CA46 cells (Figure 3b). To further validate the findings from the microarray data, we performed RT-qPCR to ascertain P53 expression levels in BL cells, eventually yielding outcomes that are in line with the front (Figure 3c). These findings imply that the downregulation of P53 expression in BL cells may be caused by EBV infection. The predicted gene targets of EBV-miR-BART5-3p were first obtained from TargetScan and RNAhybrid to further establish the connection between EBV-miR-BART5-3p with P53. According to biological informatics analysis, the EBV-miR-BART5-3p seed sequence and the 3'-UTR of P53 matched quite well (Figure 3d). Additionally, we used luciferase reporter assays and observed that the BART5-3p mimic markedly lowered the luciferase activity of the 3'-UTR when compared to the control mimic. This finding is consistent with a study conducted by Zheng et al. (Reference: Zheng et al.[35]), which raises the possibility that the BART5-3p mimic specifically targets target sites in the 3' UTR of TP53 mRNA. Next, we examined how BART5-3p affects the levels of P53 mRNA, as well as protein in BL cell lines. As demonstrated by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, higher levels of BART5-3p drastically decreased the level of P53 (Figure 3e, 3f). Based on the aforementioned information, it is highly likely that BART5-3p targets TP53, implying that BART5-3p may be involved in the reduction of P53 levels in Burkitt's lymphoma.

(b) P53 expression in different cell lines in the CCLE database. (c) The expression level of P53 in Burkitt lymphoma cells was determined by RT-qPCR.

(f-g) The expression levels of TP53mRNA and protein in BL cells following EBV-miR-BART5-3p were determined by RT-qPCR and Western Blot, * P <0.05, * * * P <0.001, original blots are presented in Supplementary Figure 3g. Inhibiting TP53 promotes BL proliferation To ascertain whether P53 downregulation produces a phenotype similar to that attained by BART5-3p, we used P53 inhibitors to downregulate P53 expression in Ramos and CA46 cells. After 48 h, we assessed P53 expression levels using RT-qPCR (Figure 4a). As expected, downregulation of P53 by miR-BART5-3p led to increased cell growth. This led us to hypothesize that maybe P53 controls how cell function. To verify this assumption, we explored the role of P53's activity in modulating the cell cycle and proliferation. Cell growth and migration were measured using CCK-8 proliferation and transwell assays, and the findings indicated that the proportion of proliferating and migrating cells increased in Ramos and CA46 cells treated with the P53 inhibitor compared to those treated with the control inhibitor (Figure 4b, 4c). In addition, in comparison to the control inhibitor, downregulating P53 increased the proportion of cells that participated in the S and G2/M phases and lowered the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase (Figure 4d). The results presented indicate that in Burkitt's lymphoma cells, BART5-3p negatively regulates P53 thus encouraging cell proliferation, migration, and alterations in cell cycle distribution. Figure 4 | Inhibiting TP53 promotes BL proliferation. (a) Expression levels of P53 after application of P53 inhibitor in Ramos and CA46 cells. (b-c) The CCK8 cell proliferation assay and transwell migration assay were used to detect cell proliferation and migration.

Three independent experiments were performed, and data are shown as the means. *, P <0.05; **, P <0.01; ***, P <0.001 compared with the control group. Inhibit the proliferation of BL after knockdown of BART5-3p in Raji cells To understand how innately expressed BART5-3p influences P53 expression in Burkitt's lymphoma cells infected with EBV, we conducted experiments using BART5-3p and P53 inhibitors in Raji cells. First, we assessed the effect of a P53 inhibitor on P53 mRNA levels. After treating Raji cells with the P53 inhibitor, we found that P53 mRNA levels decreased by 5% compared with the control (Figure 5a). We subsequently examined the effect of the BART5-3p inhibitor on P53. In comparison to the control group following inhibitor transfection, we noted a 7-fold higher level of P53 protein levels after transfecting Raji cells using the BART5-3p inhibitor (Figure 5b, 5c). The results of these studies indicate that BART5-3p, which is naturally expressed, effectively reduces P53 expression in Raji cells, elevations of P53 mRNA and P53 protein are caused by BART5-3p inhibition. Overall, these findings further support the notion that BART5-3p has a major impact on controlling the activity of P53 in EBV-infected Burkitt's lymphoma cells. To validate the regulatory significance of BART5-3p on P53 activity in BL growth, as well as to research fundamental biological processes, we conducted experiments using the Raji cell line. First, we performed CCK-8 proliferation and Transwell migration assays to assess the influence of BART5-3p on cell migration. The results indicated that upregulation of P53 by the miR-BART5-3p inhibitor reduced cell migration, whereas knockdown of P53 alone increased cell migration. Interestingly, co-transfection with the P53 inhibitor eliminated the inhibition of Raji cell growth caused by the BART5-3p inhibitor compared to the control inhibitor (Figure 5d-5f). Flow cytometry was used for additional analysis of cell cycle distribution. Compared with the control group, transfection with the BART5-3p inhibitor increased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and weakened the ratios of cells in the G2/M and S phases. In contrast, when the P53 inhibitor was used alone, it had a contrary impact on cell cycle distribution. Notably, when the miR-BART5-3p inhibitor and P53 inhibitor were co-transfected, the inhibitory effect of BART5-3p on the cell cycle was diminished (Figure 5g-h). Additionally, Similar outcomes were observed when cell cycle-related proteins were analyzed using western blotting, and the expression levels of these proteins were in line with the modifications observed in the distribution of the cell cycle. (Figure 5i). Taken together, these results imply that BART5-3p stimulates cell growth and cycle change through the direct downregulation of P53 in Raji cells. The upregulation of P53 by the miR-BART5-3p inhibitor leads to the suppression of cell growth and alterations in cell cycle distribution, while knockdown of P53 reverses these effects.

CONCLUSIONS The miR-BARTs encoded by EBV play a crucial role not only in the capacity of the EBV virus to cause cancer but also in its control over the cell cycle. The BART gene produces 44 full-length miRNAs that are significantly expressed in EBV-associated lymphoma from 22 precursor miRNAs (miR-BART1-22)[36]. In our study, we showed that EBV-positive Raji cells have elevated levels of BART5-3p. To further explore how EBV-encoded genes promote the development of Burkitt lymphoma, we altered BART5-3p levels in BL cells that were linked to EBV. Our findings indicate that BART5-3p considerably enhances proliferation in vitro. Importantly, previous studies have indicated that cells in the S phase are more numerous and those in the G0/G1 phase are fewer when BART5-3p is present[35]. These findings were consistent with our results. Additionally, we determined that TP53 was the target of BART5-3p. leading to upregulation of cyclinD1 proteins. This involvement in regulating the cell cycle of BL cells contributes to cell growth and tumorigenesis. The p53 gene is one of the most well-known tumor suppressors[37]. Zheng et al. reported that BART5-3p has been identified in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma along with gastric cancer cells compared to normal cells, promoting tumor growth. Furthermore, p53 can be degraded by BART5-3p overexpression[35]. Similarly, other studies have highlighted that downregulating BART5-3p can increase P53 expression by targeting it, thus enhancing the radiosensitivity[38] of human EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells [38]. In line with these findings, our research team performed bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays, confirming that BART5-3p may bind to P53's 3'-UTR regions and cause the protein to be reduced. These findings provide further evidence for the close association between the P53 gene and the oncogenic mechanism of EBV. To understand the fundamental processes of BART5-3p in BL proliferation, we employed an integrated strategy that involved process enrichment analysis, literature retrieval, computational biology prediction, and verification of gene regulation in cells. Using this approach, we identified 285 differentially expressed genes between EBV-negative and EBV-positive samples, along with several significant pathways. Interestingly, we found that the cell cycle is a major pathway involved in the oncogenic mechanisms of EBV infection in BL. This suggests that EBV-miR-BART5-3p regulates the cell cycle to promote BL proliferation. Further investigation into the specific genes and molecular events involved in this pathway could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of EBV-associated BL. P53 plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle and interacts with other cell cycle regulators to maintain the normal progression of the cell cycle[39]. P53 and cyclin-CDK complex: P53 can inhibit the activity of the cyclin-CDK complex, thereby preventing cells from entering the S phase[40, 41]. Consistent with these findings, when we added P53 inhibitors to EBV-infected Raji cells, we noticed significantly elevated levels of cyclinD1 protein genes. In order to further verify the effect of BART5-3p on the cell cycle of Burkitt lymphoma through P53, we added BART5-3p inhibitor to Raji cells before and found that the proportion of cells entering the S phase was much lower than that of the control group, and when BART5-3p inhibitor and P53 inhibitor were used together, It was found that P53 inhibitors could partially reverse the cell cycle induced by BART5-3p into S phase. This suggests that BART5-3p may induce the proliferation of Burkitt lymphoma cells by down-regulating P53. In summary, our findings indicate that EBV promotes cell growth in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells through miR-BART5-3p-mediated targeting of P53. Our data also demonstrated that BART5-3p plays a significant role in the cancer cell cycle by regulating P53. These results offer new perspectives on the carcinogenic mechanism of EBV in Burkitt lymphoma.   CLINICALTRIAL -
