We developed a new electrocatalysts for hybrid homogeneous / heterogeneous conversion of CO2 in water. A Molybdenum-based organometallic compound has been linked by covalent C-C bond to a carbon-cloth electrode surface. This technique allows using the Mo catalyst in water, a solvent in which the catalyst is not soluble, for the direct electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol. Although the system displays moderate current density (1÷4 mA/cm2), the very high faradaic efficiency of the CO2-to-methanol conversion (65%), the good selectivity (H2 is the only other reduction product), the simply experimental setup and the potential industrial scale-up of the technique makes this approach of great interest. Chronoamperometric measurement carried in water for 21 hours show a stable and constant catalytic performance with no other carbon-reduced products. Spectroelectrochemistry and detailed DFT calculations shed light on the catalytic process, which consists of six protons coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps. We propose the catalytic cycle that converts CO to methanol in which the first step is a PCET localized on the CO coordinated to the metal.

Abstract In this study, a cross‐linked boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photocatalyst containing a carbazole donor group designed for photoelectrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction is synthesized and characterized. The BODIPY‐based system, coated onto a platinum surface, is evaluated for its electrochemical and photocatalytic performance under light illumination. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry measurements reveals enhanced photocurrent responses, confirming the catalyst's ability to effectively drive CO 2 reduction. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) analysis identifies the formation of ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) as a major reaction product, showing that its yield increased with extended reaction times. Additionally, the photocatalyst demonstrates remarkable performance with significantly increasing turnover numbers (TON) and turnover frequencies (TOF) over time, indicating stable and sustained catalytic activity. With a Faradaic efficiency of 34.79% at a potential of ‐1.15 V, this BODIPY system exhibits both high activity and long‐term stability. The combination of efficient electron transfer and visible light absorption by the carbazole‐BODIPY donor‐acceptor structure positions this system as a highly promising candidate for sustainable CO 2 conversion applications.

Abstract This study focuses on investigating the sole impact of an external electric field on the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 -based materials. Typically, built-in electric fields are used to efficiently separate free energy carriers and improve the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors. The creation of such field requires modifications to the photocatalyst that alter various properties such as adsorption and optical characteristics. These modifications make it challenging to isolate and interpret the promotion effect associated with the electric field alone. The investigations were carried out in the gas-phase conditions in a specially constructed reactor equipped with two electrodes connected to a high – voltage that provides a field strength of up to 5.7·10 3 V/cm. The results showed that the effect of electric field promotion varied significantly depending on the properties of titanium dioxide, such as structure, adsorption, and presence of impurities. The strength and the type (direct or alternating current) of the electric field also played a determining role. The greatest promoting effect was observed for rutile, the photocatalytic activity of which under an electric field increased threefold in the process of reduction of CO 2 with water vapor.

The Cu cocatalyst supported on the surface of TiO2 photocatalysts has demonstrated unique activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The valence state of copper significantly influences the catalytic process; however, due to the inherent instability of copper’s valence states, the precise role of different valence states in CO2 reduction remains inadequately understood. In this study, CuOx/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized using an in situ growth reduction method, and we investigated the impact of various valence copper species on CO2 photocatalytic reduction. Our results indicate that Cu+ and Cu0 serve as primary active sites, with the selectivity for CH4 and CO products during CO2 photoreduction being closely related to their respective ratios on the catalyst surface. The adsorption and activation mechanisms of CO on both Cu+ and Cu0 surfaces are identified as critical factors determining product selectivity in photocatalytic processes. Furthermore, it is confirmed that Cu+ primarily facilitates CH4 production while Cu0 is responsible for generating CO. This study provides valuable insights into developing highly selective photocatalysts.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising route to storing chemical energy and producing valuable chemicals, while also contributing to carbon cycle closure. Despite significant advances in electrocatalytic CO2RR for multi-carbon products, challenges remain in optimizing catalysts for high selectivity and efficiency. Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts are among the most promising options; however, enhancing their catalytic efficiency and product selectivity remains complex due to several factors. One key challenge is that product selectivity heavily depends on the catalyst’s surface morphology, which impacts both Faradaic efficiency and overpotential requirements for target product formation. Additionally, the reaction pathways and intermediates for multi-carbon products are not yet fully understood, complicating efforts to achieve consistent multi-carbon yields. Variability introduced by the electrolyte environment, applied potential, and operating conditions further impacts selectivity and efficiency. This review aims to address these challenges by exploring the interplay between the surface structure of Cu-based catalysts and system parameters that shape reaction pathways for ethanol formation. Notably, we explore alternative pathways beyond the conventional mechanisms involving CHO, COH, and CO dimers.

The results of a thermodynamic analysis of the course of chemical reactions of the stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide by CO gas and the gasification reaction of solid carbon (Bella-Boudoir) are presented. The goals of the work are to obtain eigenexpressions for calculating the numerical values of the Gibbs free energy depending on temperature using tabulated values of the standard enthalpies of formation and entropies of inorganic substances, as well as to construct graphical dependences of the Gibbs energy on temperature using formulas from literary sources and obtained expressions. Numerical values of the boundary temperatures are obtained above which the chemical reactions of the stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide by CO gas and the chemical reaction of gasification of solid carbon (Bella-Boudoir) can or cannot thermodynamically proceed. Considering the complete coincidence of the obtained data on the own (obtained) expressions using two (direct and indirect) methods, it is possible to consider with a significant degree of probability the numerical values of the boundary temperature for the reactions of stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide and gasification of solid carbon as reliable, which indicates the possibility of the reduction of Mn2O3 from MnO2, Mn3O4 from Mn2O3 and MnO from Mn3O4 by CO gas, the Bell-Boudoir reaction and the impossibility of the reduction of manganese from MnO by CO gas at the temperatures of the actual process in reduction furnaces. This also confirms that CO gas is not a manganese reducer at the last stage of stepwise reduction of MnO according to scheme (B), refuting any theories and assumptions about the possibility of reducing Mn from MnO by CO gas.

CeO2/CuO heterojunction composite catalysts were synthesized using a one‐step method, achieving the introduction of Ce species on nanoscale copper oxide (CuO) particles during the hydrothermal process. On one hand, this protects the nanostructure of the substrate from damage and prevents the agglomeration of CuO nanoparticles. On the other hand, the bimetallic synergistic effect between Ce and Cu effectively improves the conductivity and catalytic activity of the catalyst, significantly enhancing the selectivity of the catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C2H4, while effectively suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By regulating the amount of CeO2 introducing, a series of CeO2/CuO composite catalysts were designed. The results showed that the 15% CeO2/CuO catalyst exhibited the best selectivity and catalytic activity for C2H4. At a low overpotential of −1.2 V, the 15% CeO2/CuO catalyst demonstrated a current density of 14.2 mA cm⁻² and achieved a Faradaic efficiency for ethylene as high as 65.78%, which is 2.85 times the current density (j = 4.98 mA cm⁻²) and 3.27 times the Faradaic efficiency for ethylene (FEC2H4 = 20.13%) of the undoped catalyst at the same potential. This work provides a feasible basis for achieving efficient CO2RR to C2 products, and even multi‐carbon products.

## The Role of Na+ in the First Step of CO2 Reduction to Methane in Methanogenic Bacteria

Methanogenic bacteria are strictly anaerobic archaebacteria that are defined by their ability to form methane as the end product of their energy metabolism. This group of organisms had been studied extensively because of their phylogenetic status as archaebacteria (Archaea)1-3 and because of their important ecological role in the anaerobic carbon cycle.4 The study of the biochemistry of methanogenesis is of particular interest because of the participation of several unique types of cofactors and a number of unusual types of enzymes.5-8 All methanogens belong to the euryarchaeotal branch of the Archaea forming phylogenetically rather distantly related major groups, the Methanococcales (e.g., Methanococcus voltae), the Methanobacteriales (e.g., Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum), and the Methanomicrobiales (e.g,, Methanosarcina barkeri). The phylogenetic diversity is also reflected by a great diversity in morphology, cell wall structure, and metabolic and physiological properties (for recent reviews see References 9 to 11). Most methanogens can be cultivated on mineral salt media containing various energy substrates (see below), and ammonia and sulfide generally serve as nitrogen and sulfur sources, respectively. Various trace elements proved to be essential for growth of methanogens, most notably nickel, cobalt, and molybdenum,12-14 which are components of various enzymes and coenzymes involved in methanogenesis, and Na+, which is involved in energy coupling (see below).

The iron and steel industry, a major energy consumer, faces significant pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. As the world’s largest steel producer, China must prioritize this sector to meet its carbon neutrality goals. This study provides a comprehensive review of various carbon reduction technologies to drive decarbonization in the steel industry. China’s iron and steel sector, which accounted for approximately 15% of the country’s total CO2 emissions in 2022, predominantly relies on coke and coal combustion. This study provides a comprehensive review of a variety of carbon reduction technologies to advance decarbonization in the iron and steel industry. This study categorizes carbon reduction technologies in the steel sector into low-carbon, zero-carbon, and negative-carbon technologies. Low-carbon technologies, which are the most widely implemented, are further divided into energy structure adjustment, material structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement technologies, etc. This study specifically reviews dry quenching technology, high-scale pellet technology for blast furnace, and top pressure recovery turbine power generation technology. As a zero-carbon technology, hydrometallurgy is a central focus of this study and a key area of research within China’s iron and steel industry. While negative-carbon technologies are primarily centered around carbon capture, utilization technologies are still in early stages. By presenting the latest advancements, this study offers valuable insights and guidance to facilitate the iron and steel industry’s transition to a low-carbon future, crucial for mitigating global climate change.

Abstract Understanding abiotic carbon fixation provides insights into early Earth’s carbon cycles and life’s emergence in terrestrial hot springs, where iron sulfide (FeS), similar to cofactors in metabolic enzymes, may catalyze prebiotic synthesis. However, the role of FeS-mediated carbon fixation in such conditions remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the catalytic behaviors of FeS (pure and doped with Ti, Ni, Mn, and Co), which are capable of H 2 -driven CO 2 reduction to methanol under simulated hot spring vapor-zone conditions, using an anaerobic flow chamber connected to a gas chromatograph. Specifically, Mn-doped FeS increases methanol production five-fold at 120 °C, with UV−visible light (300–720 nm) and UV-enhanced light (200–600 nm) further increasing this activity. Operando and theoretical investigations indicate the mechanism involves a reverse water-gas shift with CO as an intermediate. These findings highlight the potential of FeS-catalyzed carbon fixation in early Earth’s terrestrial hot springs, effective with or without UV light.

Density functional theory calculations are employed to investigate the effects of various metal dopants on thiolates‐protected transition metal nanoclusters (NCs) for CO2 reduction, focusing on deviations from the linear scaling relation between COOH* and CO* for high CO selectivity. We first explore the most favorable positions for different dopants in several M25 (M = parent metal) NCs and assess the potential for ligand removal under reducing conditions. Furthermore, we construct an activity volcano for CO production in D1M24 NCs (D = dopant), revealing that NCs composed of coinage parent metals with group 12 metal dopants exhibit the most significant deviation from the scaling relation. This behavior is attributed to the tendency of these NCs to bind COOH* in a bidentate form, which stabilizes the O atom of COOH* through interactions with the oxyphilic dopants. As a result, several group 12 metal doped coinage metal NCs are identified as new promising candidates for syngas production due to their high activity towards both CO and H2 production.

Tin (Sn)‐based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single‐atom Sn (e.g., Sn‐N‐C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnOx and SnSx; x=1,2) on their pH‐dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large‐scale data mining (with >2,300 CO2RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH‐field coupled microkinetic modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn‐N4‐C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH‐dependent volcano evolution for Sn‐N4‐C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn‐based catalysts.

The natural carbon cycle cannot mitigate and recycle the excess CO2 in the atmosphere, leading to a continuous rise in the global temperature. Electrochemical conversion of CO2 is one of the useful methods to utilise this anthropogenic CO2 and convert it into value‐added chemicals. However, this process suffers the challenges of product selectivity and good Faradaic efficiency. In our current work, we report the role of Zn‐doping in the 2D‐Nanosheet of Cu2(OH)3(NO3)‐ a pre‐catalyst that undergoes the in situ transformation into metallic state along with surface reconstruction. Our studies show, in the aqueous medium, the optimum amount of Zn plays a crucial role in the production of ethanol with the Faradaic efficiency of ∼45.2% though C‐C coupling. Temperature‐programmed desorption studies conclude that Zn increases the product selectivity for CO adsorption on Cu2(OH)3(NO3) nanosheets, further facilitating the C‐C coupling at higher negative potential. The detailed XPS studies also reveal that the in‐situ conversion of Cu2+ to Cu0 and Cu+ at negative potential contributes to the production of C2 products. The post‐catalytic microstructural and spectroscopic studies converge to this point that cumulative effect of oxidation state, surface reconstruction, as well as the presence of Zn modulates overall Faradaic efficiency for ethanol formation.

Concrete is the most widely used construction material globally. However, its production, particularly that of cement, is a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, contributing to approximately 8% - 10% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This study aims to analyze and compare the embodied carbon (eCO2) of various concrete strength grades commonly utilized in Indonesia to offer insights for enhancing sustainability in the construction industry. The methodology involved designing concrete mixes according to Indonesian standards and calculating carbon emissions for each component. The findings revealed that the eCO2 in the Indonesian concrete mixes was significantly higher than that reported in the UK and US databases. This higher carbon footprint emerges primarily due to the greater cement content found in the Indonesian mixes. Nevertheless, the current study demonstrated that using fly ash as a supplementary cementitious material can substantially reduce the eCO2, with the mix containing fly ash showing a 42% reduction in emissions compared to the mix without fly ash. This research emphasizes the necessity for the Indonesian construction industry to adopt sustainable practices, including optimized mix designs and the use of low-carbon materials such as fly ash. In doing so, significant reductions in the carbon footprint of concrete can be achieved, contributing to the global efforts to mitigate climate change and to promote sustainability in construction practices.

The main goal of this study is to develop charging stations that use solar energy as an environmentally friendly alternative, in order to reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions produced from burning fossil fuels. The method used is qualitative with data collection through system observation and analysis of solar panel performance with dual-axis technology that can follow the movement of the sun. The results of the study show that the use of solar panels equipped with dual-axis actuators can increase the efficiency of sunlight absorption, so that the power produced is more optimal. From the analysis, it was found that these stations not only provide an efficient charging solution, but also contribute to a reduction in carbon footprint, with the potential for significant reductions in CO2 emissions. The conclusion of this study shows that the development of solar energy-based charging station technology is a strategic step in supporting the transition to a more sustainable energy source in Indonesia.

The utilization of renewable energy for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) represents a pivotal technology in sustainable carbon conversion. Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) featuring transition metal‐nitrogen‐carbon (M‐N‐C) structures have demonstrated exceptional electrocatalytic efficacy in CO2RR by maximizing atom efficiency. Nevertheless, further investigation is warranted to optimize the catalytic performance of SACs through the selection of suitable carbon sources and supports, as well as the modulation of the microenvironment surrounding individual metal atoms. In this study, a sulfur‐doped Ni‐N‐C catalyst was prepared using a two‐step strategy involving metal ion adsorption and thermal decomposition, with porous ion exchange resin serving as the carbon source. Due to the uniform distribution of single atom active centers on the resin‐based carbon support and sulfur doping, this catalyst efficiently converts CO2 into CO with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% within the range of −0.79 ~ −1.29 V (vs. RHE), reaching a maximum value of 97.7% (−0.79 V vs. RHE). Theoretical calculations indicate that second‐shell sulfur doping effectively promotes coupled transfer of protons and electrons, leading to a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy barriers for CO2RR intermediate products.

Leather, a versatile material, faces high resource consumption and waste issues in production. This study explores the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as a green solvent for leather impregnation, assessing its impact on the leather’s chemical and physical properties. Furniture and upper shoe leathers were exposed to CO2 pressures between 100 and 250 bar at 40°C. Results show decreasing fat content with increased pressure, which correlates with reduced tensile strength - especially significant in upper shoe leather at 250 bar with a nearly 50% reduction in fat content from 7% to 3.7% and tensile strength from 480 N to 250 N. However, pressure treatment can also enhance tensile strength when fat reduction is low. The highest increase in tensile strength, from 110 N to 180 N, was observed for furniture leather following treatment at 100 bar. In industrial settings with lower CO2 surplus, fat extraction impacts are assumed to be minimal, suggesting significant potential for resource-efficient leather production using scCO2.

Деятельность человека, в том числе сельскохозяйственная, ведет к значительной продукции парниковых газов, среди которых доминирующее положение занимает CO2 . Увеличение концентрации парниковых газов в атмосфере ведет к негативным изменениям климата на Земле. Возделывание сахарной свеклы в ЦЧР отчуждает большое количество CO2 из атмосферы, связывая его в форме углеводов, что позволяет рассматривать свекловичный агроценоз как сток углерода. Основные агротехнические приемы, несмотря на некоторое количество выделения С-CO2 , не способны превысить его поглощение основной продукцией; это свидетельствует о том, что в свеклосахарном производстве эмиссия углекислого газа меньше, чем сток. Сохранение гумусового состояния черноземов, внесение рациональных доз удобрений, ослабление минерализации органических удобрений, известкование, заделка пожнивных и корневых остатков сахарной свеклы и культур-предшественников способствует снижению эмиссии углекислого газа из свекловичных агроценозов. Human activity, including agricultural one, leadstosignifi cant production of greenhouse gases, among which С-CO2 occupies a dominant position. Cultivation of sugar beet in the Central Black-Earth Region takes a great quantity of С-CO2 from atmosphere forming carbohydrate compounds that allows considering sugar beet agrocenosis as a carbon stock. Main agrotechnical methods, though evolving some С-CO2 quantity, do not able to exceed its absorption by main product. This is the evidence of the fact that, in sugar beet industry, carbonic acid gas emission is somewhat lower than the stock.

Wound healing as a result of a skin injury involves a series of dynamic physiological processes, leading to wound closure, re-epithelialization, and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The primary scar formed by the new ECM never fully regains the original tissue’s strength or flexibility. Moreover, in some cases, due to dysregulated fibroblast activity, proliferation, and differentiation, the normal scarring can be replaced by pathological fibrotic tissue, leading to hypertrophic scars or keloids. These disorders can cause significant physical impairment and psychological stress and represent significant challenges in medical management in the wound-healing process. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of exogenously applied carbon dioxide (CO2) on fibroblast behavior, focusing on viability, proliferation, migration, and differentiation to myofibroblasts. We found that CO2 exposure for up to 60 min did not significantly affect fibroblast viability, apoptosis rate, or proliferation and migration capacities. However, a notable finding was the significant reduction in α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expression, indicative of myofibroblast differentiation inhibition, following CO2 exposure. This effect was specific to CO2 and concentration as well as time-dependent, with longer exposure durations leading to greater reductions in α-SMA expression. Furthermore, the inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation correlated with a statistically significantly reduced glycolytic and mitochondrial energy metabolism, and as a result, with a reduced ATP synthesis rate. This very noticeable decrease in cellular energy levels seemed to be specific to CO2 exposure and could not be observed in the control cultures using nitrogen (N2)-saturated solutions, indicating a unique and hypoxia-independent effect of CO2 on fibroblast metabolism. These findings suggest that exogenously applied CO2 may possess fibroblast differentiation-reducing properties by modulating fibroblast’s energy metabolism and could offer new therapeutic options in the prevention of scar and keloid development.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere and the substrate for the photosynthetic fixation of carbohydrates in plants. Increasing GHGs from anthropogenic emissions is warming the Earth’s atmospheric system at an alarming rate and changing its climate, which can affect photosynthesis and other biochemical reactions in crop plants favorably or unfavorably, depending on plant species. For the substrate role in plant carbon reduction reactions, CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in air potentially enhances photosynthesis. However, N uptake and availability for protein synthesis can be a potential limiting factor in enhanced biomass synthesis under enriched [CO2] conditions across species. Legumes are C3 plants and symbiotic N fixers and are expected to benefit from enhanced [CO2] in the air. However, the concurrent increase in air temperatures with enhanced [CO2] demands more detailed investigations on the effects of [CO2] enhancement on grain legume growth and yield. In this article, we critically reviewed and presented the online literature on growth, phenology, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, productivity, soil health, and insect behavior under elevated [CO2] and temperature conditions. The review revealed that specific leaf weight, pod weight, and nodule number and weight increased significantly under elevated [CO2] of up to 750 ppm. Under elevated [CO2], two mechanisms that were affected were the photosynthesis rate (increased) and stomatal conductivity (decreased), which helped enhance water use efficiency in the C3 legume plants to achieve higher yields. Exposure of legumes to elevated levels of [CO2] when water stressed resulted in an increase of 58% in [CO2] uptake, 73% in transpiration efficiency, and 41% in rubisco carboxylation and decreased stomatal conductance by 15–30%. The elevated [CO2] enhanced the yields of soybean by 10–101%, peanut by 28–39%, mung bean by 20–28%, chickpea by 26–31%, and pigeon pea by 31–38% over ambient [CO2]. However, seed nutritional qualities like protein, Zn, and Ca were significantly decreased. Increased soil temperatures stimulate microbial activity, spiking organic matter decomposition rates and nutrient release into the soil system. Elevated temperatures impact insect behavior through higher plant feeding rates, posing an enhanced risk of invasive pest attacks in legumes. However, further investigations on the potential interaction effects of elevated [CO2] and temperatures and extreme climate events on growth, seed yields and nutritional qualities, soil health, and insect behavior are required to develop climate-resilient management practices through the development of novel genotypes, irrigation technologies, and fertilizer management for sustainable legume production systems.

The role of the maritime industry in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate the effects of global warming is significant. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a specific target for the industry, but the challenge is to implement emission-reducing technologies at scale. The use of fossil fuels is still dominant in the shipping sector, also due to the significant barriers that hinder the full adoption of carbon-neutral alternative fuels. The transition to a low-carbon economy presents an opportunity for the industry to lead the way towards a sustainable innovation and demonstrate a commitment to reducing its environmental impact. In this context, Carbon Capture System (CCS) technologies have been identified as a promising solution, but their implementation on ships comes with its own set of challenges. In this paper, the authors aims at exploring the technical requirements and consequences of the installation of a CCS based on the use of Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) onboard a container ship. To validate their assumptions, the authors set up a simulation tool able to evaluate the potential reduction in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions from the ship along a selected route. On the basis of the tool outcomes, the authors were able to provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed system’s costs and benefits, emphasizing the considerable savings that could be attained through the implementation of this technology on board cargo ships with a specific consideration to the future implementation of carbon emission taxes and a focus on the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) regulation. The findings of this research offer valuable perspectives on creating more effective and environmentally friendly approaches to mitigate GHG in the maritime sector.

Understanding of the nature and role of the electric double layer (EDL) at electrocatalytic interfaces, and its dynamic evolution, is critical to optimizing electrochemical processes such as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Despite its postulated significant influence on CO2RR activity, direct spectroscopic evidence of the complex interplay between EDL structure and reaction kinetics has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Dynamic Response Spectroscopy (DRS), a novel approach that isolates spectroscopic signatures of key physicochemical features of the EDL, including the compact (interfacial) layer and the diffuse double layer based on their time-variance profiles. By analyzing multi dimensional time-variance within a matrix of time-resolved infrared spectral data recorded during sequential potential steps, we reveal that EDL equilibration is not continuous but involves discrete restructuring events. We correlate these sudden EDL reorganizations with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2 to CO, providing - to the best of our knowledge - the first direct spectroscopic evidence of such a phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that saturation of aqueous NaHCO3 electrolytes with CO2, as opposed to Ar, induces more frequent and pronounced water reorientation in the diffuse double layer, characterized by less ice-like ordering and increased randomness. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic nature of the EDL and its synergistic role in electrocatalysis, establishing a paradigm to better understand, and thus optimize electrochemical systems.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by China in in 2013 prioritizes environmental sustainability and regional economic development from a global perspective. Although the BRI has achieved considerable economic progress in many cities and regions, research on its environmental impacts is still insufficient, with limited attention paid to domestic urban areas in particular. Existing studies have focused primarily on carbon emissions, ignoring the broader environmental impacts of industrial emissions, such as those from smart transportation. To address this gap, this study adopts four major pollutant emissions—carbon dioxide (CO2), industrial particulate matter, industrial sulfur dioxide (SO2), and industrial wastewater emissions—as indicators to assess pollution levels in urban environments. Adopting panel data from 281 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2021, this study employs the difference-in-differences (DID) method to estimate the effect of the BRI on urban environmental pollution. This study is based on the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1. BRI implementation has reduced urban pollution emissions. Hypothesis 2. Advancements in science and technology will drive the implementation of the BRI. Hypothesis 3. A proactive government response can significantly reduce urban environmental pollution. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, BRI implementation significantly reduces urban environmental pollution by 1.05%. Second, the policy effects of the BRI are more pronounced in the eastern and western regions and in larger cities, implying that geopolitical- and market-oriented strategies are important for regional performance. Third, scientific and technological progress positively affects pollution reduction in urban environments. Fourth, the BRI contributes to strengthening government intervention, which subsequently improves sustainable governance, reduces urban environmental pollution, and promotes regional economic cooperation. Our findings will serve as a crucial reference for future policymaking endeavors toward eco-friendly logistics cooperation in the region.

Abstract. Developing effective global strategies for climate mitigation requires an independent assessment of green-house gas emission inventory at the urban scale. In the framework of the Dutch Ruisdael Observatory infrastructure project, we have enhanced the Dutch Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) model to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) plume emission and three-dimensional dispersion within the turbulent boundary layer. The unique ability to explicitly resolve turbulent structures at the hectometer resolution (100 m) makes DALES particularly suitable for detailed realistic simulations of both singular high-emitting point sources and urban emissions, aligning with the goals of Ruisdael Observatory. The model setup involves a high-resolution simulation (100 m × 100 m) covering the main urban area of the Netherlands (51.5°–52.5° N, 3.75°–6.45° E). The model integrates meteorological forcing from the HARMONIE-AROME weather forecasting model, background CO2 levels from the CAMS reanalysis, as well as point source emissions and downscaled area emissions derived from 1 km × 1 km emission inventory from the national registry. The latter are prepared using a sector-specific downscaling workflow, covering major emission categories. Biogenic CO2 exchanges from grasslands and forests are interactively included in the hectometer calculations within the heterogeneous land-surface model of DALES. Our evaluation strategy is twofold, comparing DALES simulations with: (i) the state-of-the art LOTOS-EUROS model simulations and (ii) in-situ Cabauw tower measurements and Ruisdael surface observations of the urban background in the Rotterdam area at Westmaas and Slufter. Our comprehensive statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of DALES in modeling the urban-scale CO2 emission distribution and plume dispersion under turbulent conditions, but also revealed potential limitations and areas for further improvement. Thus, our new model framework provides valuable insights into emission transport and dispersion of CO2, in support of emission uncertainty reduction using atmospheric measurements and the development of effective climate policies.

Abstract Accurate energy system modelling of chemical separations is a critical component of technology selection to minimize operating costs, energy consumption and emissions. Here we report a hybrid modelling approach based on data-driven and mechanistic models to holistically compare chemical separation performance. Our model can be used to select the most suitable technology for a given chemical separation, such as membrane separation, evaporation, extraction or hybrid configurations, by training a machine learning model to predict solute rejection using an open-access membrane dataset. We estimated an average 40% reduction in energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for industrially relevant separations using our methodology. We predicted and analysed 7.1 million solute rejections across several industrial sectors. Pharmaceutical purification could realize carbon dioxide emissions reductions of up to 90% by selecting the most efficient technology. We mapped the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and the reduction in operating costs globally, establishing parameter thresholds to facilitate corporate and governmental decision-making.

Novel amides of some amino and citric acids were synthesized and studied for their ability to improve the kinetics of carbon dioxide hydrate formation. It was demonstrated that these compounds can be effective promoters of hydrate formation, even at low concentrations. The addition of citric acid and norleucine amide (CTR+Nle) increased the water-to-hydrate conversion and significantly reduced the induction time. At a concentration of 0.05 wt. %, the conversion rate reached 57 ± 3 %, which is 21 and 3.1 % higher than in water without additives and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution, respectively. In the presence of CTR+Nle, the induction time decreased to 35 min, which is an 8.1-fold reduction compared to water without additives, as well as 5.8-fold less than with tryptophan solution known as a promoter of carbon dioxide hydrate formation.

In efforts to mitigate global warming, reducing greenhouse gas emissions represented by carbon dioxide, this paper introduces a stepped carbon trading mechanism for local Integrated Energy Systems (IES) that are not yet engaged in carbon trading markets as a tool for carbon emission rights trading. To minimize both overall system costs and carbon trading expenses, we propose a refined Power-to-Gas (P2G) model that includes a waste heat recovery process. In addition, all gas-fired units within the IES are retrofitted to support low-carbon operations, and a coupled operation mode of carbon capture power plants and P2G is introduced. To manage uncertainties in wind and solar power output, Latin hypercube sampling and K-means clustering methods are employed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling strategy significantly reduces system operating costs while realizing an ∼16.2% reduction in carbon emissions.

The report discusses the serious environmental issues Indonesia's growing economy and rising energy use have brought about. In addition to examining government initiatives to lessen these impacts through sustainable development regulations, the goals include evaluating the connection between economic indicators and environmental results. The research employs a mixed-approaches strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative analysis, which employs time series data from 1991 to 2020, focuses on carbon dioxide emissions per capita as the dependent variable and GDP and energy consumption per capita as independent variables. Multiple linear regression using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) evaluates these correlations. A thorough grasp of the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and environmental deterioration is provided by qualitative analysis, which entails a review of the literature to investigate government initiatives addressing environmental concerns. The study results show a substantial positive correlation between Indonesia's carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, energy consumption, and economic development. The analysis indicates that the ongoing economic activities driven by fossil fuel consumption will exacerbate environmental degradation without significant intervention, necessitating effective government policies for sustainable development and emission reduction. The study concludes that economic growth and energy consumption significantly contribute to Indonesia's environmental degradation, particularly through increased carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. It recommends that the government strengthen policies promoting sustainable energy use, increase investment in renewable energy technologies, and implement stricter regulations on industrial emissions. Additionally, fostering public awareness and education on environmental sustainability is crucial for effective long-term solutions.

This study aims to analyze and evaluate different types of alternative fuels for aviation from a life cycle and cost perspective. It aims to analyze different alternative fuels and their use in aircraft for this purpose in the aviation sector in relation to their potential to be a suitable transition solution towards sustainable transformation. Using the GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies) aviation module developed by the US National Research Laboratory (Argonne), the life cycles of petroleum and six different sustainable aviation fuel production methods were calculated, and the environmental impact of kerosene and sustainable aviation fuels in terms of cost and carbon dioxide emissions on long, medium and short-haul flights were analyzed. The life cycle values of carbon dioxide formed as a result of the production of corn, soybean and canola products, which are the most preferred to produce biofuel in the aviation industry, with hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) methods, were calculated. As a result of the study, it was determined that the cost of the sustainable aviation fuels examined was higher than fossil fuel. The key to greater acceptance and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel is cost reduction. In the long term, this will require investment in advanced technologies to process feedstocks more efficiently on a larger scale and in the development of sustainable and scalable feedstock options. However, in the short term, temporary support from governments and other stakeholders through policy incentives is needed.

In recent years, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental remediation has become a topic of great interest. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), linked by covalent bonds, have emerged as promising materials in the field of electrocatalysis due to their well-defined structures, high specific surface areas, tunable pore structures, and excellent acid–base stability. However, the low conductivity of COF materials often limits their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. To enhance the catalytic performance of COF-based catalysts, various nanomaterials are integrated into COFs to form composite catalysts. The stable and tunable porous structure of COFs provides an ideal platform for these nanomaterials, leading to improved electrocatalytic activity. Through rational design, COF-based composite electrocatalysts can achieve synergistic effects between nanomaterials and the COF carrier, enabling efficient targeted electrocatalysis. This review summarizes the applications of nanomaterial-incorporated COF-based catalysts in hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. Additionally, it outlines design principles for COF-based composite electrocatalysis, focusing on structure–activity relationships and synergistic effects in COF composite nanomaterial electrocatalysts, as well as challenges and future perspectives for next-generation composite electrocatalysts.

Abstract Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion into valuable chemicals paves the way for the realization of carbon recycling. Downsizing catalysts to single‐atom catalysts (SACs), dual‐atom catalysts (DACs), and sub‐nanocluster catalysts (SNCCs) has generated highly active and selective CO 2 transformation into highly reduced products. This is due to the introduction of numerous active sites, highly unsaturated coordination environments, efficient atom utilization, and confinement effect compared to their nanoparticle counterparts. Herein, recent Cu‐based SACs are first reviewed and the newly emerged DACs and SNCCs expanding the catalysis of SACs to electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR) to high‐value products are discussed. Tandem Cu‐based SAC–nanocatalysts (NCs) (SAC–NCs) are also discussed for the CO 2 RR to high‐value products. Then, the non‐Cu‐based SACs, DACs, SAC–NCs, and SNCCs and theoretical calculations of various transition‐metal catalysts for CO 2 RR to high‐value products are summarized. Compared to previous achievements of less‐reduced products, this review focuses on the double objective of achieving full CO 2 reduction and increasing the selectivity and formation rate toward C–C coupled products with additional emphasis on the stability of the catalysts. Finally, through combined theoretical and experimental research, future outlooks are offered to further develop the CO 2 RR into high‐value products over isolated atoms and sub‐nanometal clusters.

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to n‐propanol, a high‐energy‐density C 3 chemical, presents a promising method for the long‐term storage of renewable electricity. However, the C 1 ‐C 2 coupling step, crucial for C 3 conversion, suffers from low selectivity and sluggish conversion rate. In this study, a strategy is proposed to regulate the adsorption of C 2 active species on Cu by introducing an atomically dispersed Zr, which can effectively enhance the electroreduction of CO 2 to n‐propanol. In situ infrared spectroscopy and theoretical studies unveil that the introduce of atomically dispersed Zr modulates the adsorption configuration of * C 2 intermediates and strengtnens the binding with * C 2 intermediates, thus lowing the energy barrier of the C 1 –C 2 coupling process and accelerating the conversion efficiency. This novel catalyst achieves a n‐propanol Faradaic efficiency of 14.4 ± 0.3% and a high production rate of 70.0 ± 1.0 mA cm −2 , comparable to the best reported values of the CO 2 ‐to‐propanol electroconversion. This study highlights the effectiveness of designing synergistic electrocatalysts to boost the production of high‐value energy products, providing a promising path toward achieving carbon neutrality.

Energy metabolism at the emergence of life has been the topic of intense theoretical and experimental study. Alkaline hydrothermal vents (AHVs) may have facilitated energy-transfer and carbon-fixation at life’s emergence, via a primordial chemiosmotic mechanism. Specifically, pH separation across vent walls could have been the forerunner to pH separation across microbial membranes, with electron-conductive inorganic barriers containing [Ni-]FeS minerals mimicking the active sites of metalloenzymes in potentially ancient biological reductive acetyl-CoA Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, reverse Krebs and other metabolic pathways. We previously demonstrated pH gradient dependent reduction of CO2 to formate by H2 in AHV interface conditions. Here, we address the same problem of CO2 reduction, however using a macroscale reactor that allowed us to use minerals synthesized via protocols analogous to the alkaline vent mount formation. This reactor also allowed us to probe more variables, and explore longer experimentation time-frames. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the effect of the different aspects of the gradientrich hydrothermal-vent interface on the observed CO2 electrochemical reduction- such as different minerals, temperature gradients, as well as the flow of electrons under passive vs. induced currents and potentials. Using experimental simulations and electrochemistry techniques, We detected two key steps of the WL pathway (CO2 to formic acid, and the formation acetic acid) as well as reactions in the reverse Krebs cycle (fumarate to succinate). Both Ni in the mineral, and temperature as a property, were shown to affect the formation of formate. Extremely small currents were enough to efficiently carry out CO2 reduction. This work develops benchmarks to electrochemically explore the model of protometabolisms in the vent-ocean interface and opens to future analyses on the catalytic or electrocatalytic properties of Fe-[Ni-]S minerals as precursors of metalloenzymes.

The focus of this study is to design and simulate a grid tied solar PV system for a higher institution of learning using University of Botswana, Faculty of Engineering and Technology building as a case. The grid-connected system aimed at reducing the energy bill and contributes to the reduction of the CO2 emissions. The system uses the physical data and PVsyst software and OpenSolar and google earth to determine the key parameters crucial for the design of the project. Technical performance analysis of the proposed rooftop PV plant showed that the energy injected into the grid, with consideration of all losses amounts to 480MWh/year with a substantial lifetime carbon reduction of 991.2tons. The economic evaluation of the designed system showed that the project is profitable at the discontinued payback period of 8.63 years and the annual energy bill reduction of 32% is achieved. These results are beneficial to institutions and any other entity that would like to migrate from their use of conventional power in that they will gain an insight on their CO2 emission reduction and contribution to the national quota, their expected energy and cost savings. Governments and utilities can also benefit from these results in integrating with their energy and CO2 emissions.

Carbon Capture Utilization Storage (CCUS) into geological storage (e.g., Enhanced Oil or Gas Recovery) provides a solution to reduce CO­2 emissions. However, it still remains a potential operational problem, such as sand problem phenomena in producer wells. This study observes the phenomenon of sand problems in production wells possibly triggered by CO2-brine-rock interactions on CO2 injection in rich dolomite sandstone reservoir. This research performs several experimental works (i.e., time-lapse dry mass measurements, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and elastic wave measurements) by using CO2-brine-rock batch experimental setup as well as geochemical simulation to observe mineral dissolution, pore structures alteration as well as rock physics alteration due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. We used an outcrop sample of dolomite-rich sandstone from the Air Benakat Formation, South Sumatera, Indonesia. Our experimental and simulation works show that dolomite dissolution (dolomite reduction of ~4% after 14 soaking days), secondary porosity development (11% of visible porosity improvement), as well as rock strength reduction, occur indirectly (shown by elastic wave velocity, i.e. and reduction of ~3.8% and ~4.4%, respectively) due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. Subsequently, the results of elastic wave velocity measurements were then used to modify a considerable sand onset prediction (sand-free envelope) model. The modified model showed that the production well was more prone to sand problems due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. Thus, it is concluded that the sand onset prediction model with considering CO2-brine-rock interactions could help to design a better sand management strategy in producer wells.

Abstract This study analyzes the impacts of institutional quality on CO2 emissions for Korea, using an autoregressive distributed lags model. We investigate the long-run relationship between CO2 emissions, economic growth, energy consumption, renewable energy consumption, and various dimensions of institutional quality. Our findings suggest that improvement of selected dimensions of institutional quality, including control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and voice and accountability, can significantly contribute to CO2 emissions reduction. The results also support the validity of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and Korea has reached the turning point of CO2 emissions decline accompanied by economic growth. The analysis also indicates that renewable energy consumption has a positive impact on reducing CO2 emissions. These results underscore the critical role of effective institutions in fostering sustainable economic development and environmental protection in South Korea.

Direct converting low concentration CO2 in industrial exhaust gases to high-value multi-carbon products via renewable-energy-powered electrochemical catalysis provides a sustainable strategy for CO2 utilization with minimized CO2 separation and purification capital and energy cost. Nonetheless, the electrocatalytic conversion of dilute CO2 into value-added chemicals (C2+ products, e.g., ethylene) is frequently impeded by low CO2 conversion rate and weak carbon intermediates' surface adsorption strength. Here, we fabricate a range of Cu catalysts comprising fine-tuned Cu(111)/Cu2O(111) interface boundary density crystal structures aimed at optimizing rate-determining step and decreasing the thermodynamic barriers of intermediates' adsorption. Utilizing interface boundary engineering, we attain a Faradaic efficiency of (51.9 ± 2.8) % and a partial current density of (34.5 ± 6.4) mA·cm−2 for C2+ products at a dilute CO2 feed condition (5% CO2 v/v), comparing to the state-of-art low concentration CO2 electrolysis. In contrast to the prevailing belief that the CO2 activation step ( $${{CO}}_{2}+{e}^{-}+\, * \,\to {}^{ * }{CO}_{2}^{-}$$ ) governs the reaction rate, we discover that, under dilute CO2 feed conditions, the rate-determining step shifts to the generation of *COOH ( $${}^{ * } {{CO}}_{2}^{-}+{H}_{2}O\to {}^{ * } {COOH}+{{OH}}^{-}({aq})$$ ) at the Cu0/Cu1+ interface boundary, resulting in a better C2+ production performance. The development of catalysts that operate under low concentration CO2 resembling industrial waste gases holds promise for CO2 reduction. Here, the authors report a vacuum calcination approach for regulating the Cu0/Cu1+ density on Cu-based catalysts that can electro-catalyze low-concentration CO2.

The paper manufacturing process produces liquid and gaseous alternative fuels, as well as solid wastes. These can be subsequently treated through chemical processing, oxidation, and thermal activation, resulting in adsorbent materials with CO2 adsorption capacities. The valorisation of black liquor waste resulting from paper manufacturing was achieved through a catalytic pyrolysis process using two catalysts previously prepared in house (Cu-Zn-MCM-41 and Ni-SBA-16). The HCl-treated adsorbent material, resulting from Ni-SBA-16-catalysed pyrolysis, was selected for use in CO2 adsorption tests as it had the highest specific surface area (224.06 m2/g) and pore volume (0.28 cm3/g). The adsorption experimental setup was linked to a gas chromatograph in order to evaluate CO2 adsorption efficiency using a binary gas mixture consisting of 81% CO2 and 19% N2. With a CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.61 mmol/g, a separation efficiency of 99.78%, and a CO2 recovery yield of 90.02%, it can be concluded that the developed adsorbent material resulting from Ni-SBA16-catalysed pyrolysis and HCl treatment represents a viable solution for black liquor pyrolytic solid waste removal and reduction in greenhouse gases.

Abstract Both laboratory tests and pilot wells have demonstrated the significant potential of CO2 as an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) medium. Due to the weak pressure conduction and mass transfer of the CO2-oil system, multiple zones are generated between the injection well and production well in ultra-low permeability reservoirs. This work aims to explore the characteristics of these multiple zones and the mechanisms of CO2-EOR by combining experimental results, core-scale analysis, and field-scale simulation. Long-core CO2 displacement experiments were conducted under different miscibility pressures, with production gas assayed using gas chromatography. The core-scale simulation was aligned with the experimental results, defining four CO2 fronts to distinguish different zones based on pressure, interfacial tension, and CO2 concentration along the long core. The distribution of five zones was upscaled to the field-scale model after pilot well history matching. The final step involved evaluating the miscible zone range value, CO2 injection utilization factor, oil recovery, and CO2 storage efficiency during the CO2 injection process. Results show that the boundary between the original oil zone and the oil transition zone exists at the CO2 component front, where the CO2 concentration is zero. Additionally, the location of the CO2 component front does not overlap with the contact interface of CO2-crude oil, meaning that the dissolution effect of CO2 in the oil transition zone results in the CO2 component front moving farther. Besides, when the formation pressure is higher than the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), the distance between the CO2-effective phase front and the CO2-effective component front further expands as the pressure increases, enlarging the miscible zone range. The pressure accumulates around the injection well because of slow pressure conduction. When the average formation pressure reaches 1.1 MMP, the miscible zone range is enlarged by 2.7% higher than that of the near miscible flooding (0.92 MMP), leading to a higher rate of oil recovery by 8.6% and a utilization factor of CO2 by 0.14t/t. It is for the first time that the range of five zones and the characteristics of four CO2 fronts migration is assessed, furnishing an in-depth understanding of the complicated mechanisms and phase behavior in CO2 EOR in the ultra-low permeability oil reservoir. This work contributes to providing significant information for designing an economic and environmental CO2 flooding strategy and is significant in the improvement of oil recovery and the reduction of CO2 emission.

Abstract This paper presents a geospatial approach for quantifying street-level on-road emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and carbon monoxide (CO). By leveraging an existing open-access database of real-time congestion information derived from floating car data, we tested three methods to map high-resolution dynamic traffic emissions. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the methods, we showcased results for summer workdays and winter weekends in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA). The three methods employed include (1) a physics-based relation known as the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), (2) a data-driven input-adaptive generalized linear model (GLM), and (3) their ensemble (ENS). These methods estimated traffic density with satisfactory accuracy (R 2 = 0.60–0.88, sMAPE = 31–68%). Utilizing speed-dependent emission factors retrieved from a European database, the results compared favorably against the downscaled national emission inventory, particularly for CO 2 (R 2 = 0.70–0.77). Among the three methods, GLM exhibited the best overall performance in the HMA, while ENS provided a robust upscaling solution. The modeled emissions exhibited dynamic diurnal and spatial behavior, influenced by different functional road classes, fleet compositions and congestion patterns. Congestion-induced emissions were calculated to account for up to 10% of the total vehicular emissions. Furthermore, to anticipate the forthcoming transportation transformation, we calculated emission changes under scenarios with various penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) using this geospatial approach. The introduction of CAVs could result in emission reductions of 3–14% owing to congestion improvements.

Abstract: This article presents the application of the Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) method, enhanced with specifically tuned parameters using the Taguchi method, for optimizing bridge and viaduct designs. Unlike conventional approaches, the optimization in this study encompasses the entire structure rather than focusing solely on the deck. This approach is illustrated through case studies on two viaducts located in Atalaia and Mandaguaçu along the BR-376 highway in Paraná, Brazil. In Atalaia, the optimized solutions achieved reductions in construction costs by 10.5% to 22.7%, CO2 emissions by 8.9% to 21.2%, and extended the design service life by 24.0% to 540.7%. Similarly, in Mandaguaçu, the optimizations resulted in cost reductions ranging from 9.1% to 23.2%, decreases in CO2 emissions from 12.7% to 23.5%, and increases in the design service life by up to 540.7%. The study also revealed consistent patterns between the degrees of freedom and objective functions; specifically, larger cross-sectional dimensions tended to lower costs, while smaller dimensions were associated with reduced CO2 emissions. These findings illustrate the real-world performance improvements afforded by the optimization process, which not only reduces the global cost per year of service compared to the original designs but also enhances economic and environmental performance, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of MOPSO in structural optimization for sustainable infrastructure development.

Abstract The red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis has recently been recognized for its unique ability to significantly reduce methane emissions from ruminant animals when fed in small quantities. The main obstacle in using this seaweed as a methane‐mitigating feed supplement is the lack of commercially available biomass. Little is known about how best to grow this red alga on a commercial scale, as there are few published studies that have investigated the factors that influence growth, physiology, and overall performance. This study examined the effects of temperature and CO 2 enrichment on the growth, photophysiology, and concentration of bromoform, the secondary metabolite largely responsible for methane reduction in A. taxiformis . A series of single and multifactor closed culture experiments were conducted on A. taxiformis collected, isolated, and cultured from populations in Southern California. We identified the optimal temperature range to be between 22 and 26°C, with significant short‐term stress observed below 15°C and above 26°C. Carbon dioxide addition resulted in increased performance, when accounting for growth per CO 2 use. In general, we observed the highest bromoform concentrations in algae with the highest growth rates, but these results varied among experiments. These findings indicate that through environmental control and by addressing limiting resources, significant increases in biomass production and quality can be achieved.

While widely acknowledged as the father of the Hydrogen Economy and worthy to be dubbed as grandfather of the Methanol Economy, John O’Mara Bockris (JOMB) continued to inspire important environmental advances to the end of his most creative life. His co-invention of what may turn out to be a ground-breaking US Patent 8,413,420 helps to open the way to capturing CO2 from automotive exhausts and its conversion to recyclable methanol fuel, thereby greatly reducing and possibly even reversing global warming. Most recently, in a letter dated shortly before his death, published herein as the Appendix, JOMB pointed to inexpensive mass production of methanol from natural gas via the syngas route which may lead to the displacement of gasoline by methanol as the main automotive fuel and to major reductions in global CO2 emissions.

The paper discussed the current research on the applicability of biosorbents for the purification of biogas, particularly the decrease of H2S by using encapsulated or embedded biological biomass. This study investigated the potential of alginate-yeast biosorbent (AlgY) for biogas purification, focusing on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal. A biogas column test was conducted to compare the biosorption efficiency of AlgY and pure alginate beads. Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effects of column length, acquisition time, and biosorbent type were evaluated for CH4, CO2, and H2S removal. Results depicted significant H2S reduction, with AlgY achieving a p-value of < 0.0001 and a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9518). The relatively high correlation coefficient (R2) of the tested quadratic model of all the responses were recorded (R2; 0.5560, 0.5048, and 0.9518 for CH4, CO2, and H2S respectively). According to the studies’ preliminary findings, the type of biosorbent has a significant role in determining the biosorption effectiveness.

Smart grids are modernized, intelligent electricity distribution systems that integrate information and communication technologies to improve the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the electricity network. However, existing smart grids only integrate renewable energies when it comes to active demand management without taking into consideration the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper addresses this problem by forecasting CO2 emissions based on electricity consumption, making it possible to transition to renewable energies and thereby reduce CO2 emissions generated by fossil fuels. This approach contributes to the mitigation of climate change and the preservation of air quality, both of which are essential for a healthy and sustainable environment. To achieve this goal, we propose a transformer-based encoder architecture for load forecasting by modifying the transformer workflow and designing a novel technique for handling contextual features. The proposed solution is tested on real electricity consumption data over a long period. Results show that the proposed approach successfully handles time series data to detect future CO2 emissions excess and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

Climate change is a pressing global issue, leading to the establishment of various carbon reduction goals, and thus carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has attracted considerable attention. This article provides an overview of the primary carbon capture and storage technologies, explores their technical principles along with their pros and cons, and examines the challenges they encounter. There are three ways to capture carbon: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion. Post-combustion capture includes adsorption, absorption and membrane separation. Adsorption can be further categorized into four specific technologies: Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA), Pressure swing adsorption (PSA), Vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), and Electric swing adsorption (ESA). Absorption has physical and chemical types. Membrane separation is to filter the gas to CO2. Pre-combustion capture is to use physical solvents to separate the gas. Oxy-combustion uses pure oxygen to obtain CO2. There are three ways to store carbon, geo-sequestration, marine storage and mineralization storage. Geo-sequestration is to bury CO2 in a suitable state in the rock layer below the surface. Marine storage is to bury CO2 in various places in the sea in a classified manner. Mineralization storage refers to the use of solid waste rich in calcium and magnesium to mineralize CO2 and produce chemical products. There are three main challenges facing CCS technology: economically, the cost is too high with low benefits. The technology is not mature enough and will consume too much energy. Environmentally, there is a potential for ecological deterioration.

Amid escalating climate change concerns, methane—a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential far exceeding that of carbon dioxide—demands urgent attention. The Canadian dairy industry significantly contributes to methane emissions through cattle enteric fermentation and manure management practices. Precise benchmarking of these emissions is critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study ingeniously integrates eight years of Sentinel-5P satellite data with advanced machine learning techniques to establish a methane concentration benchmark and predict future emission trends in the Canadian dairy sector. By meticulously analyzing weekly methane concentration data from 575 dairy farms and 384 dairy processors, we uncovered intriguing patterns: methane levels peak during autumn, and Ontario exhibits the highest concentrations among all provinces. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unexpected shifts in methane emissions due to altered production methods and disrupted supply chains. Our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model adeptly captures methane concentration trends, providing a powerful tool for planning and reducing emissions from dairy operations. This pioneering approach not only demonstrates the untapped potential of combining satellite data with machine learning for environmental monitoring but also paves the way for informed emission reduction strategies in the dairy industry. Future endeavors will focus on enhancing satellite data accuracy, integrating more granular farm and processor variables, and refining machine learning models to bolster prediction precision.

In the current century, air pollution is known as one of the most critical environmental problems and it is important to find the relations of air pollution and human health. Various air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can negatively affect women’s fertility. An exhaustive electronic search was done from 2013 until July 2023 in PUBMED and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The following keywords were combined using Boolean hints in the databases queried: air pollution AND (fertility OR miscarriage OR embryo quality OR embryo development OR pregnancy OR implantation OR live birth). The randomized controlled trials, case-control and cohort studies analyzing the impact of air pollutants on fertility were included in the review. In this systematic review, a significant relation was found between the increase in air pollution and the reduction of fertility health, live birth rates, embryo quality, fertility, implantation rates, and miscarriage in exposed women. These results suggest low fertility health rates are associated with traffic-related air pollution. This review has concluded four components (particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur, and carbon monoxide) of traffic pollution that can impair women’s fertility. Air pollution harms women’s fertility. These effects affect gamete’s quality at the genetic and epigenetic level. These effects also alter fetal development. Studies have also reported an effect on fetal growth with increased miscarriages. Since air pollution is everywhere and has many sources, it seems necessary to increase the awareness of people and government officials, especially in hygiene and health, to limit air pollutants as much as possible.

Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value‐added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously. Yet, it remains an ongoing challenge due to the competition with thermodynamically more preferred ethylene production. Herein, we presented a CO2 reduction predilection switch from ethylene to ethanol (ethanol‐to‐ethylene ratio of ~5.4) by inherently implanting Cu sites with perfluorooctane to create interfacial non‐covalent interactions. The 1.83%F‐Cu2O organic‐inorganic hybrids (OIHs) exhibited an extraordinary ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) of ∼55.2%, with an impressive ethanol partial current density of 166 mA cm‐2 and excellent robustness over 60 hours of continuous operation. This exceptional performance ranks our 1.83%F‐Cu2O OIHs among the best‐performing ethanol‐oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts. Our findings identified that C8F18 could strengthen the interfacial hydrogen bonding connectivity, which consequently promotes the generation of active hydrogen species and preferentially favors the hydrogenation of *CHCOH to *CHCHOH, thus switching the reaction from ethylene‐preferred to ethanol‐oriented. The presented investigations highlight opportunities for using noncovalent interactions to tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, bringing it closer to practical implementation requirements.

The incorporation of waste glass as a component in clinker production presents a sustainable approach to addressing critical challenges in the cement industry, including the reduction of CO2 emissions and effective waste management. Waste glass, characterized by its high silica content and alkali properties, can serve as an alternative alkali source in clinker manufacturing, replacing traditional raw materials and regulating the alkali-sulphur ratio. This dual functionality not only optimizes the chemical balance in the kiln process but also enhances clinker quality by controlling phase formation. The utilization of waste materials in industrial processes is increasingly significant in promoting circular economy principles. Integrating waste glass reduces the dependence on natural raw materials such as limestone and clay, which are associated with high energy and CO2 emission intensities during production. Furthermore, waste glass contributes to a reduction in the carbon footprint of cement production by facilitating lower-temperature clinkering, thus cutting energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This study highlights the potential of waste glass as a viable alternative in clinker production, emphasizing its importance in achieving sustainability goals. Beyond the environmental benefits, adopting waste materials in industrial applications contributes to waste diversion from landfills, resource conservation, and cost efficiencies, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable development.

_ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 219309, “The Economics of CCUS Projects in Conjunction With Large Offshore Gas Projects,” by Chresten S. Meulengracht, SPE, NRG Models, and Deddy Hasanusi, Semesta Energi Services. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ The complete paper examines the economics of carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) projects, either standalone or in conjunction with large offshore gas projects, in Denmark, Indonesia, and Australia. An analysis of the legislation in these countries reveals to what degree the frameworks are defined to support CCUS projects. Economic-robustness analyses of the projects are performed to determine under which circumstances CCUS strengthens or weakens the business cases for the operators. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)/CCUS Legislation in Three Countries Denmark. Summary and History of Legislation. Denmark initiated its first CCS legislation by issuing permits in 2023 for CO2 storage exploration in the Danish North Sea to three companies with exclusive exploration rights for 6 years, extendable to 30 years if suitable storage locations are found. A significant initiative is the Greensand project, aiming to store up to 8 mtpa CO2 by 2030. These efforts are part of Denmark’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. The second bidding round for onshore CO2 storage has been completed, and licenses will be awarded in 2024. The Danish government has proposed a plan for onshore CCS to achieve reductions of at least 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030. CO2 Taxes. Denmark’s government has proposed a uniform CO2 emissions tax for businesses. However, not all companies will pay the same rate, according to the proposal. The government proposal, entitled Green Tax Reform, aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 3.7 million tonnes by 2030. The government proposes a CO2 tax of 750 kroner per tonne of emission. Companies covered by an EU quota system will receive a deduction and only will be required to pay half of the full amount. Companies in the mineralogical processing sector are to be given further discounts on the tax and only will pay 100 kroner per tonne of emissions. CCUS Incentives. The Danish Energy Agency has created two subsidy funds, the CCUS Fund and the Negative Emissions via CCS (NECCS) Fund, to support the deployment of CCS technology in Denmark. The CCUS Fund can support the capture of both fossil and biogenic CO2, while the NECCS Fund will exclusively support the capture of biogenic CO2. Indonesia. Summary and History of Legislation. Indonesia has introduced a comprehensive regulatory framework for CCS and CCUS in upstream oil and natural gas business activities. Regulation includes the rights, obligations, and liabilities of contractors to implement CCS technology in their oil and gas working areas, and the monetization of CCS projects and CCS activities closure. Indonesia aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, and CCS is seen as a promising means of reducing carbon emissions to achieve this goal. Furthermore, a presidential regulation allows CCS operators to set aside 30% of their storage capacity for imported CO2.

Southeast Asia is suffering from extreme weather, and its carbon emissions are increasing rapidly. For efficient emission reduction, clarifying the complex sources behind is necessary. This study takes a new perspective of incorporating multiple GHGs (greenhouse gases) into the same analysis framework, employing the STIRPAT model to dissect the contributions of various socio-economic factors to the emissions of CO2, CH4, and F-gases based on panel data. The analysis reveals that the driving coefficients of total population and urbanization rate are several to 10 times higher than those of other factors and can reach up to 2.98 and 4.715 and are the most significant drivers of GHG emissions in the region. Quadratic per capita GDP shows a significant positive driving effect, indicating that most Southeast Asian countries are unlikely to reach the Kuznets point in current development trajectories. The driving coefficients of F-gases in industrialized countries are significantly higher than those of other GHGs, indicating that their growth rate of F-gases will outpace that of CO2 and CH4. In countries with a similar industrial structure, the driving coefficient of CO2 from the secondary industry is up to 0.183 and down to 0.057, shows the influence of specific sector composition in the secondary industry on emissions. These findings provide critical insights for Southeast Asian policymakers aiming to develop effective climate policies.

Abstract Urea is a popular foliar nitrogen (N) source in turfgrass (TG) management. Before urea can be assimilated, it must be hydrolyzed by urease, a nickel (Ni) dependent metalloenzyme, into ammonium and carbon dioxide. Due to the prevalence of urea use in TG management and the low use efficiency associated with N fertility, more research is necessary to improve efficiency of foliar applied N. Two experiments were conducted to examine N metabolism under foliar urea fertility and Ni application of two warm‐season TG species. TifEagle ultradwarf bermudagrass [ Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt‐Davy] and Diamond zoysiagrass [ Zoysia matrella (L.) Merr.] were established in solution culture containing three Ni concentrations [Control (tap water), 200, and 400 µg Ni L −1 ]. Urease activity and amino acid pools were increased under Ni applications, however, an overall decrease in N concentration in leaf tissue was observed over the course of the study. In the second study, TifEagle and Diamond received four Ni concentrations (Control, 400, 800, and 1600 µM supplied as NiCl 2 ) with irrigation to replace evapotranspiration (ET) every 48 h for 6 weeks. The Control turfgrass not receiving Ni had 3 mg kg −1 Ni concentrations in leaf tissue and no toxicity symptoms. Visual toxicity symptoms and growth reductions were observed in TG receiving 400, 800, and 1600 µM Ni regimes which resulted in leaf tissue Ni concentrations of 101, 227, and 420, respectively. There was a reduction in clipping yields from Diamond and TifEagle receiving 1600 µM Ni compared to Control (24.1% and 32.5%, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both), and a significant linear relationship ( p = 0.004, R 2 = 0.34 and ( p < 0.0001, R 2 = 0.47, respectively) between Ni concentration and clipping yield. Growth and quality of Diamond and TifEagle declined as leaf tissue Ni concentration surpassed 3 mg kg −1 .

The transportation sector contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 24% of the world’s CO2 emissions. Green technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), alternative fuels, and smart infrastructure have emerged as critical tools for reducing the sector’s environmental impact. This study examines the role of ecological policy support in facilitating the adoption of these green technologies and their subsequent effect on emission reduction. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the study analyzes survey data from 410 respondents across several Asian countries, focusing on the relationships between green technology adoption, environmental policy, and emission reductions. The results demonstrate that ecological policy support acts as both a direct and mediating factor, significantly enhancing the adoption of EVs, alternative fuels, and smart infrastructure, leading to substantial emission reductions. The findings highlight the importance of solid and supportive policies in accelerating the transition to eco-mobility and achieving global climate goals.

The construction industry is considered a strategic sector due to its importance in the economy, its export capacity, and its roots in local communities, where it provides quality employment. It is currently based primarily on the use of Portland cement, a building material obtained by calcining a mixture of limestone and clays at high temperatures. Large amounts of carbon dioxide are produced during the calcination process, which is problematic from an environmental standpoint, as carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse gases. Emissions from the production of Portland cement are mainly due to two sources. First, the burning of fuels to achieve the calcination temperature, and second, the decarbonization reaction that occurs during the calcination of limestone. Limestone, a calcium carbonate, transforms into calcium oxide when calcined, releasing large amounts of CO2. Major efforts are being made in the cement industry to reduce these emissions. One strategy focuses on natural inorganic materials that enhance the properties of the cementitious mixture through their hydraulic or pozzolanic activity, or both, known as supplementary cementitious materials. These materials reduce the amount of calcium oxide in the cement, known as the clínker factor, and therefore decrease the direct emissions generated during calcination. Among the supplementary cementitious materials are pozzolans, aluminosilicates of natural origin that do not have hydraulic properties but, when finely ground, react with the calcium hydroxide in cement in the presence of water, providing resistance and improving some properties of the cement. The main objective of the present work is to investigate different non-calcined natural materials as supplementary cementitious materials to obtain more sustainable cementitious products. For this purpose, different varieties of natural zeolites and other vitreous or zeolitized materials have been studied to replace various percentages of cement in mortars and concretes. The materials used were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Mortar and concrete specimens were subjected to compressive strength tests at different ages to assess their mechanical properties. Additionally, ultrasonic wave velocity tests, monitoring the setting temperature of the concrete specimens, and the complex conductivity (CC) geophysical method to monitor the cement products are used to enhance the understanding of cement reactions. The results indicate that pozzolanic materials are optimal raw materials for sustainable cement and mortar production. Despite a decrease in mechanical strength, the reduction in emissions and improvement of other properties make these materials a viable option from an economic, technological, and environmental perspective. RESUMEN La industria de la construcción se considera un sector estratégico, por su importancia en la economía, su capacidad exportadora, y su arraigo en las comunidades locales en las que ofrece empleo de calidad. En la actualidad está basada principalmente en el uso de cemento Portland, un material de construcción que se obtiene a partir de la calcinación de la mezcla de caliza y arcillas a alta temperatura. Durante este proceso de calcinación se producen grandes cantidades de dióxido de carbono, lo que supone un problema desde un punto de vista medioambiental, ya que es considerado uno de los principales gases de efecto invernadero. Las emisiones procedentes de la elaboración del cemento Portland son debidas principalmente a dos fuentes: la quema de combustibles para obtener la temperatura de calcinación y la reacción de descarbonatación que se produce durante la calcinación de la caliza, una roca rica en carbonato cálcico que al ser calcinada se transforma en óxido de calcio, desprendiendo grandes cantidades de CO2. En la industria cementera se están realizando grandes esfuerzos para reducir estas emisiones. Una de las estrategias se centra en el uso de materiales naturales inorgánicos que contribuyen a la mejora de las propiedades de la mezcla cementicia a través de su actividad hidráulica, puzolánica, o ambas, denominados materiales cementantes suplementarios. Con el uso de estos materiales se reduce la cantidad de óxido de calcio presente en el cemento, conocido como factor clínker, y por lo tanto, las emisiones directas generadas en la calcinación. Dentro de los materiales cementantes suplementarios se encuentras las puzolanas, aluminosilicatos de origen natural o artificial que no poseen propiedades hidráulicas, pero, que finamente molidas reaccionan con el hidróxido de calcio del cemento en presencia de agua y proporcionan resistencia y mejora en algunas propiedades del cemento. El principal objetivo del presente trabajo es el estudio de diferentes materiales naturales no calcinados como material cementante suplementario, para la obtención de productos cementicios más sostenibles. Para ello, se han estudiado diferentes variedades de zeolitas naturales y otros materiales vítreos o zeolitizados para sustituir diferentes porcentajes de cemento en morteros y hormigones. Los materiales utilizados se han caracterizado mediante microscopía electrónica de barrido (SEM), difracción de rayos X (DRX) y/o fluorescencia de rayos X (FRX). Se han elaborado probetas de mortero y hormigón con sustituciones de parte del cemento por estos materiales. Sobre estas probetas se han realizado ensayos de resistencia a compresión a diferentes edades, 7, 28 y 90 días en el caso de las probetas de mortero y 28, 9 y 180 días en las probetas de hormigón, llegando a la edad de 2 años de curado en dos de las mezclas estudiadas. Adicionalmente, se han realizado ensayos de velocidad de las ondas ultrasónicas, se ha monitorizado la temperatura de fraguado de las probetas de hormigón y se ha utilizado el método geofísico de conductividad compleja (CC), como métodos de monitorización de los productos del cemento para aumentar el conocimiento de las reacciones del cemento. A raíz de los resultados obtenidos se puede observar que los materiales puzolánicos en su mayoría son una materia prima óptima para la obtención de cementos y morteros sostenibles. A pesar de que el incremento de las resistencias mecánicas de las probetas de morteros y hormigones es más lento que en las probetas de cemento portland el descenso de las emisiones y la mejora de otras propiedades hacen de estos materiales una opción viable desde un punto de vista económico, tecnológico y ambiental.

Every household uses an average of around 360 litres of water each day. About 21% of a typical gas consumption is attributed to heating the water for showers, baths, and hot water from the tap. An environmentally friendly, low-cost device called the CombiSave valve can be used to manage gas and water consumption and should be fitted to most combination boilers to automatically control the flow of water every time a hot tap is turned on. This allows the boiler to heat the water faster and only return the flow to normal once a usable temperature is reached. An experimental test was conducted in the exemplar modern house of Liverpool John Moores University in order to assess the amount of water, energy, and CO2 reduction for varying temperatures and flow rates. The test was carried out for a duration of 9 hours during the daytime between June and October. Although the test was conducted over relatively warm months when ambient water temperatures were higher compared to winter months, results showed that good savings could be achieved through this product. The best savings for gas consumption and hence CO2 reduction were achieved at high water pressure and low temperature setting (40℃) of 36% compared with the case without combiSave. While water consumption was reduced by 56% at full flow rate and 45℃. Further research is needed encompassing multiple occupied dwellings with different family sizes and testing these in extreme weather conditions to see if similar results would be reflected.

The transition to green energy and sustainable operations poses a key challenge for the mining industry, which has traditionally been known for its negative environmental impact. This manuscript researches the concept of the "green transition" in mining, focusing on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in methodological support for environmental restoration. The aim is to identify and analyze technological and methodological innovations that can facilitate the shift of mining operations towards more environmentally sustainable practices. The current challenges in the mining industry are analyzed, including carbon dioxide emissions, water pollution, and land degradation. Successful green transition projects in mining are presented, highlighting how the use of renewable energy sources and material recycling can reduce the environmental footprint of mining activities. The role of artificial intelligence in supporting these efforts is important. AI technologies, including machine learning and data analytics, can significantly enhance environmental monitoring and management processes. Specific examples of AI applications in predicting environmental risks are presented, optimizing resource use, and developing strategies for ecosystem restoration. AI algorithms enable more precise and efficient pollution monitoring, identification of optimal restoration sites, and assessment of the long-term effects of mining activities on the environment. Integration of AI into the mining industry can not only improve environmental performance but also contribute to economic benefits through cost reduction and increased efficiency. This paper emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach that includes collaboration between managers, engineers, ecologists, and AI experts to achieve sustainable development goals. Further research and investment in these areas are crucial for the successful green transition of the mining industry and the long-term preservation of the environment. This research contributes to the understanding of the potential of green transition in mining and the role of AI in achieving sustainable environmental solutions, providing a foundation for future studies and practical applications.

Abstract With the increasing number of waste tires, rubberized concrete, as a sustainable building material, has garnered widespread attention for its performance and environmental benefits. This study utilized KH-570 modified rubber particles to replace ordinary sand in the preparation of concrete, assessing the workability, shrinkage performance, and axial compression characteristics of rubberized concrete, and establishing a stress-strain constitutive model. The research indicates that the introduction of rubber particles enhances the irregularity and roughness of particles within the concrete matrix, leading to increased inter-particle friction and a reduction in workability. Pre-treatment with KH-570 effectively improves workability, particularly when the rubber content is 15%. Rubberized concrete exhibits higher ductility and slower crack propagation rates, with a decrease in elastic modulus and peak stress as rubber content increases, indicating an enhancement in the deformability and toughness of the concrete. The KH-570 pre-treatment partially counteracts this trend and significantly improves the energy absorption capacity of the concrete. The addition of unmodified rubber particles leads to an increased shrinkage rate in concrete, while the surface pre-treatment with KH-570 enhances the adhesion of rubber to the cementitious matrix, mitigating concrete shrinkage. The proposed axial stress-strain constitutive model for rubberized concrete accurately predicts the mechanical characteristics during the transition from elastic to plastic behavior. Rubberized concrete significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions per unit volume, especially in untreated rubberized concrete, and offers better cost-effectiveness. In the construction of airport patrol roads, rubberized concrete demonstrates excellent durability and lower maintenance costs. In summary, rubberized concrete not only improves the ductility and toughness of concrete but also offers significant environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising sustainable building material.&#xD;

Abstract Background Climate change is a critical global issue, impacting ecosystems, economies and communities worldwide. The shift from paper‐based to digital systems is becoming increasingly prevalent across industries, with downstream positive impacts on sustainability. In 2020, Austin Health, a public tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia, adopted a web‐based outpatient booking application, which succeeded the prior paper‐based system. The application served as an integrated platform for administrative staff to access various Austin Information Technology platforms and replaced previous mail‐based outpatient appointment notifications with Short Message Service‐based notifications. This study aimed to assess the environmental impact and organisation‐wide economic cost of a web‐based outpatient booking application compared to the prior paper‐based system across the same time period. Methods A retrospective environmental and economic assessment was conducted for both the web‐based booking application and the paper‐based system. The evaluation covered 36,925 outpatient diagnostic imaging studies – including CT, MRI, ultrasound and mammography – performed at Austin Health from 1st July 2023 until 30th June 2024. The environmental impact was assessed by calculating the expected carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions produced by each system. The economic cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of the hospital and included the direct costs of labour and materials/consumables. Results CO 2 e emissions were significantly reduced using the web‐based outpatient booking application compared to the prior paper‐based system (38.5 tonnes compared to 0.002 tonnes), predominantly attributable to the elimination of postage‐related fuel emissions (27.7 tonnes). The estimated net operating cost savings across the year was at least AUD 175,000 (in 2024 Australian Dollars, adjusted for inflation). This was primarily due to labour savings from the elimination of workflow inefficiencies (at least 2342 h saved) amounting to at least AUD 85,272 in salary, followed by savings from eliminated pathology tests (AUD 57,422) and postage costs (AUD 55,193). Conclusion The adoption of the web‐based outpatient booking application led to a substantial reduction in carbon emissions and operating costs, alongside enhanced operational efficiency and productivity. These benefits are anticipated to be enduring, especially in the face of an ever‐increasing demand for medical imaging services.

In order to reduce CO₂ emissions from industrial processes, countries have commenced the vigorous development of CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and storage) technology. The high geographical overlap between China’s extensive coal mining regions and CO2-emitting industrial parks provides an opportunity for the more efficient reduction in CO2 emissions through the development of Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (ECBM) Recovery for use with CCUS technology. Furthermore, the high geographical overlap and proximity of these regions allows for a shift in the transportation mode from pipelines to tanker trucks, which are more cost-effective and logistically advantageous. The issue of transportation must also be considered in order to more accurately assess the constructed cost function and CCUS source–sink matching model for the implementation of ECBM. The constructed model, when considered in conjunction with the actual situation in Shanxi Province, enables the matching of emission sources and sequestration sinks in the province to be realized through the use of ArcGIS 10.8 software, and the actual transport routes are derived as a result. After analyzing the matching results, it is found that the transportation cost accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total cost. In fact, the CH4 price has a larger impact on the total cost, and a high replacement ratio is not conducive to profitability. When the proportion of CO2 replacing CH4 increases from 1 to 3, the price of CH4 needs to increase from $214.41/t to $643.23/t for sales to be profitable. In addition, electric vehicle transportation costs are lower compared to those of fuel and LNG vehicles, especially for high-mileage and frequent-use scenarios. In order to reduce the total cost, it is recommended to set aside the limitation of transportation distance when matching sources and sinks.

This research numerically investigates the heat transfer and flow patterns of supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2 ) in a six‐start spirally fluted tube. The research focuses on the geometrical optimization of the tube based on three key parameters: the groove depth ( e 1 ), the gap between the main tube and the outer sleeve ( e 2 ), and the thread pitch ( p ). The influence of these parameters on the heat transfer coefficient ( h ) and friction factor ( f ) was also investigated and analyzed. Furthermore, the study examined the overall impact of the gravity inclination angle (δ) on the thermal performance and flow velocity of the spirally fluted tube. The results indicated that the optimal geometrical parameters are as follows: e 1 / D = 0.33, e 2 / D = 0.04, and p / D = 8.33, yielding the highest values of h / h 8 /( f / f 8 ) in the spirally fluted tub. The change in e 2 has a more significant effect on turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and thermal performance than the change in e 1 . The p value showed a more substantial effect on the f value compared with the h value. Furthermore, the h value was positively correlated with the gravity inclination angle δ in the region where T b < T pc . In the region where T b > T pc , increasing the gravity inclination angle δ led to a reduction in h value. When δ < 0°, the h value experienced a slight increase. However, the h value showed a substantial variation when δ > 0°, and the near‐wall fluid experienced a reduced flow velocity because of the combined effects of gravity and buoyancy, leading to a decrease in heat transfer. Larger gravity inclination angles led to a more pronounced deterioration in heat transfer. This study is anticipated to provide a theoretical basis for the optimized design of heat exchangers and the enhancement of energy conversion efficiency.

Abstract Dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engines are capable of operating on both renewable and conventional fuels. They produce ultra-low nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions while maintaining thermal efficiency similar to that of conventional diesel engine operating at part load conditions. However, the engine needs to transition to the conventional diesel combustion (CDC) mode during high speed and high load operation due to the limited operating range of the engine in the RCCI mode. This study aims to compare a virtual vehicle level drive cycle-based fuel economy and emissions data for the RCCI (operating with both gasoline-diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG)-diesel) and CDC dual combustion mode engine. In this work a combination of engine experimental data and a vehicle powertrain simulation tool (AVL CRUISE) is employed to determine the vehicle level emissions and performance of a light-duty commercial vehicle on the world-wide harmonized light-duty test cycle (WLTC). The vehicle duty cycle results demonstrate ∼62% decrease in NOx and ∼36% reduction in soot emissions with the gasoline-diesel RCCI-CDC engine compared to conventional diesel only operation. A further 26% reduction of soot emission is observed with the CNG-diesel RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engine. However, the combustion efficiency decreased in the RCCI mode resulting in a significant increase in total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Despite the poor combustion efficiency and marginally reduced thermal efficiency of the RCCI mode, the fuel economy of the vehicle, with the RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engine, undergoing the WLTC drive cycle is comparable with the diesel only vehicle. Fuel economy of 21.2 km/l (diesel equivalent) and 21.6 km/l (diesel equivalent) are estimated with the gasoline-diesel and CNG-diesel RCCI-CDC modes, respectively, compared to 22.3 km/l (diesel) of conventional diesel only operation. Engine-out CO2 reduced by 7% in case of gasoline-diesel RCCI-CDC engine whereas, due to the lower carbon to hydrogen ratio in the CNG-diesel RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engine, engine-out CO2 reduced by 16% as compared to CDC only operation. However, when the global warming potential of methane was considered, the CO2 equivalent emissions for the CNG-diesel RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engine were 1.67 times higher than that for CDC.

Abstract. Sustained anthropogenic perturbations are anticipated to influence Earth's climate system well beyond the 21st century. Despite growing interest in climate change after 2100 and improved computational resources, multi-century climate projections remain limited in number. Here, we examine a set of 10 ensemble simulations extending the Community Earth System Model 2 large ensemble (CESM2-LE) from 2101 to 2500 under the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP)3-7.0 scenario, which involves the reduction of fossil and industrial CO2 emissions to zero by 2250. By the year 2500, substantial forced changes are projected in both the spatial and temporal characteristics of variability and mean states. Post-2100, El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability is expected to diminish, while the tropical intraseasonal variability will notably strengthen. The mean state changes include a global mean temperature rise of 12 °C and a 23.5 % increase in global precipitation compared with historical observations. Additionally, substantial soil carbon release from permafrost thawing is projected over Siberia and Canada, resulting in a shift of land from a carbon sink to a carbon source after the 22nd century. The ocean experiences a rapidly diminished capacity to absorb anthropogenic CO2 after the 21st century, while nevertheless continuing to act as a carbon sink, with an increased contribution from the Southern Ocean to total carbon uptake. The model also projects a considerable decline in low-latitude marine primary production, which is linked to a considerable depletion of PO4 in the local mesopelagic domain. At urban scales, the extended simulations reveal substantial projected changes in the amplitude and phasing of precipitation seasonality, with the same holding for the partial pressure of CO2 in seawater at regional scales, demonstrating that post-2100 changes are not simply amplifications of projected 21st century changes. Taken together, these new simulations highlight the far-reaching impacts of multi-centennial climate change on both human societies and global ecosystems.

Abstract Mongolia’s faces substantial challenges to reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions due to a reliance on coal to meet electricity, heat and other energy demand and large livestock emissions. Despite this, Mongolia has committed to reduce GHG emissions by 22.7% in 2030 compared to a baseline emission scenario. Greenhouse gas mitigation assessments for Mongolia have focussed on actions to achieve emission reductions by 2030, but not on the potential for further reduction over the longer-term. This study addresses this gap through the development of long-term (2050) GHG emission pathways for Mongolia. From a technical mitigation potential perspective, these pathways aim to inform what level of GHG reduction targets Mongolia could commit to for the period after its current target expires. Greenhouse gas emissions are quantified for historic years (2010-2019) for all major GHG emitting source sectors, and projected to 2050 based on the population and socioeconomic development outlined in Mongolia’s Sustainable Development Vision 2050. Finally, mitigation scenarios that model implementation of 49 specific mitigation measures are developed, to quantify their emission reduction potential. Without mitigation, GHG emissions were estimated to increase by 67% and 139% in 2030 and 2050, respectively, compared to 2019 levels (39 million tonnes CO2-eq emissions). Implementation of the 49 mitigation measures could reduce GHG emissions by 40% in 2050 compared to the baseline. This study highlights that post-2030, Mongolia could increase its climate change mitigation ambition. Renewable Electricity generation, and energy efficiency were the measures that could achieve the majority of these additional emission reductions. However, despite the achieve emission reductions in excess of those within current commitments, there remains a substantial gap between the emission reduction potential of technically feasible measures currently being considered in Mongolia’s climate change mitigation planning, and full decarbonisation.&#xD;

The aim of this work is to analyze the prospects of using hydrogen as an alternative to coke in blast furnaces in the context of decarbonizing the steel industry, particularly considering the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). It is shown that the widespread notion of a complete replacement of coke with hydrogen needs clarification, as there are technological limitations and economic challenges. According to the analysis of global experience, the use of hydrogen in blast furnaces allows for a reduction of CO2 emissions by 10-70%, which is particularly relevant in the context of CBAM, but requires significant capital investments in the modernization of production and the creation of infrastructure for the production and transportation of hydrogen. It is shown that the efficiency of hydrogen use, and therefore its potential for reducing the cost of carbon quotas within the CBAM framework, depends on the technology of its production, the method of injection into the blast furnace, and the conditions of blast furnace smelting.

Due to legislations introduced to prevent global warming, vehicle manufacturers must find new ways to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper explores a way to reduce rolling resistance by heat-insulating and covering a truck’s wheelhouse. Truck tyre rolling resistance was measured at +5 °C ambient temperature for consecutive speed steps in a climate wind chamber with and without heat insulation. The study showed that by encapsulating and insulating the wheelhouse, already generated strain-induced heat could be kept in the tyre, consequently leading to reduced rolling resistance. The tyre shoulder temperature was monitored during the experiments along with the tyre pressure. When the wheelhouses were encapsulated, a significant reduction in rolling resistance and an increase in tyre pressure and temperature were measured at all evaluated speed levels.

The building sector is a major contributor to resource consumption, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable architecture offers a solution, leveraging Building Energy Modeling (BEM) for early-stage design optimization. This study explores the use of genetic algorithms for optimizing sustainable design strategies holistically. A comprehensive analysis and optimization model was developed using genetic algorithms to individually optimize various sustainable strategies. The optimized strategies were then applied to a pre-existing building in Kabul City, a region facing significant environmental challenges. To enhance accuracy, this study integrated energy simulations with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This research combines genetic algorithms with energy simulation and CFD analysis to optimize building design for a specific climate. Furthermore, it validates the optimized strategies through a real-world case study building. Optimizing the Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) and shading devices based on solar exposure significantly improved the building’s energy performance. South (S)-facing single windows and specific combinations of opposing and adjacent windows emerged as optimal configurations. The strategic optimization of building component materials led to substantial energy savings: a 58.6% reduction in window energy loss, 78.3% in wall loss, and 69.5% in roof loss. Additionally, the optimized pre-existing building achieved a 48.1% reduction in cooling demand, a 97.5% reduction in heating demand, and an overall energy reduction of 84.4%. Improved natural ventilation and controlled solar gain led to a 72.2% reduction in peak-month CO2 emissions. While this study focused on applicable passive design strategies, the integration of advanced technologies like Phase Change Materials (PCMs), kinetic shading devices, and renewable energy systems can further improve building performance and contribute to achieving net-zero buildings.

Abstract In the modern world, in the conditions of increasingly severe emission standards, increased oil prices and the political pressure to abandon internal combustion engines and implement electric vehicles, the search for alternative solutions for engines development is a key decision. One of these solutions currently accepted by European politicians is the use of biofuels. A highly promising fuel, which is at the very beginning of its research as an application in diesel engines, is the 1-decanol. Except for the higher viscosity and latent heat of vaporization, all its other properties are very similar to diesel fuel. One of the two ways to reduce viscosity is by blending it with another fuel, for which rapeseed biodiesel was chosen. The objective of the research is to investigate engine performance and emissions at different loads and engine speeds using decanol-biodiesel blends. Two types of blends were studied — Dec70B30 and Dec50B50. The study was conducted on a turbocharged diesel engine with common rail injection system. Compared to the diesel fuel, the results show a decrease in brake power up to 21.5%, increase in BSFC up to 19.96% at low and average loads and speeds, reduction of the CO2 emissions up to 23.33% while PM, HC and NOx emissions are variable in nature showing high increase or reduction depending the load, speed and used blend.

The LCA method was applied following ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards. The impact was assessed using the CML-1A Baseline and ILCD 2011 Midpoint+ methods, along with data from the Ecoinvent database. In the BAU scenario, the impact values observed in every 1 ton of waste managed were Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 4.90E+03 kg CO2 eq, Acidification Potential (ADP) of 2.78E-03 kg SO2 eq, Eutrophication Potential (EP) of 4.92E-02 kg PO4-eq, Human Toxicity Potential (HTP) of 2.06E+01 kg 1.4 DB eq, and Land Use Potential (LUP) of 4.71E+01 kg C deficit. Processing waste into biomass pellets and Refuse Derived Fuel accompanied by waste reduction could decrease the GWP value to 34.04 kg CO2 eq, ADP to 2.96E-06 kg SO2 eq, EP to 7.33E-05 kg PO4-eq, HTP to 3.70E-04 kg 1.4 DB eq, and LUP to 2.11E-03 kg C deficit. The results of waste management with the lowest impact value can serve as a reference for formulating waste management policies in the study area.

In natural photosynthesis, light-driven electron transfer across the thylakoid membrane enables efficient charge separation and the confinement of reaction spaces for generating NADPH and CO2 and oxidation of water. These reactions are complementary redox reactions and require different reaction conditions for optimal performance. However, current artificial photosynthesis studies only take place in the bulk and are sensitive towards oxygen and air, which limits their applicability under aerated and water-splitting conditions. Herein, we report light-driven electron transfer across a lipid bilayer membrane of liposome vesicles via a rigid oligoaromatic molecular wire that allows to electronically connect an oxidation and reduction reaction which are spatially separated by the membrane. The molecular wire has a simple, symmetric, easy-to-synthesize design based on benzothiadiazole and fluorene units and absorbs in the visible spectrum which makes it suitable for solar energy conversion. The model reactions in this study are light-driven NADH oxidation on one side of the membrane and light-driven reduction of an organic water-soluble dye in the bulk phase of liposomes. Additionally, the system is active in both aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres, rendering it ideal for aerobic conditions or reactions that produce oxygen such as solar-driven water splitting and artificial photosynthesis applications.

Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF)-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) is retrospectively defined after normalisation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in sinus rhythm. It is unclear why some patients develop AIC. Hypothesis Patients with AIC have a subtle cardiomyopathic process that precedes their AF-mediated LVEF reduction. Detailed assessment of cardiac function after successful catheter ablation will reveal this. Objective To evaluate the utility of measures to identify cardiomyopathic features that persist after LVEF normalisation in AIC. Methods Patients with rate-controlled persistent AF and LVEF<50% undergoing catheter ablation (CA) were prospectively evaluated using echocardiography, cardio-pulmonary exercise testing and serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) at baseline and 6 months after CA. Participants with AIC, (LVEF recovery (≥50%) and no other cause for cardiac dysfunction) were evaluated using left ventricular (LV) longitudinal strain and left atrial (LA) reservoir strain (LARS). Changes in peak oxygen consumption and the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope were measured as markers of functional capacity and ventilatory inefficiency. A control group of patients with persistent AF with preserved LVEF were also enrolled. Results 34/41 (82.9%) participants recovered LVEF in sinus rhythm; defined as AIC. NT-proBNP levels were elevated in 18 (52.9%), and 16 reported ongoing heart failure (HF) symptoms. 10 (29.4%) had no improvement in functional capacity, and seven (20.6%) showed persistent ventilatory inefficiency. 20 (58.8%) had impaired global LV longitudinal strain with a relative apical sparing pattern. Nine (26.5%) had impaired LARS. There was an overlap of these abnormalities. 32 (94.1%) demonstrated at least one, 17 (50.0%) having no cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with preserved LVEF during persistent AF had similar demographics but a lower burden of short R-R intervals (<660 ms) on Holter monitoring. Discussion Abnormal structural, metabolic and HF biomarkers are seen in patients with AIC in sinus rhythm. These features may represent a precedent subtle cardiomyopathic process predisposing them to left ventricular systolic dysfunction in AF. Trial registration number NCT04987723 .

The increasing demand for high-grade manganese ores in various industries has led to a growing necessity to enhance the quality of lower-grade manganese ores with time. A representative manganese ore was collected from Um Bogma, Sinai, Egypt, and subjected to various characterization methods including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and ore microscopy. XRF analysis revealed a low Mn/Fe ratio of 2.81 (as elements), indicating a low ore grade. For suitability in Mn alloy production at the Sinai Manganese Company (SMC) plant in Abu Zenimah, southeast of Sinai, Egypt, this ratio should ideally exceed 5. Additionally, XRD and ore microscopy identified the mineralogical composition of the ore as pyrolusite, hematite, and manganite, with manganese patches embedded in a ferruginous groundmass at the textural scale. Three different reduction roasting techniques were evaluated, involving conventional heating in a furnace utilizing either CO – CO2 or charcoal as reducing agents, alongside reduction roasting with charcoal utilizing microwave technology. Following each technique, magnetic separation was employed, resulting in the production of high-grade manganese concentrates exhibiting high Mn/Fe ratios ranging from 19.8 to 27.45 and substantial Mn recovery rates ranging from 93.86% to 96.76%.

Abstract Heating accounts for significant primary resource consumption and generation up to 30 % of total GHG emissions in the EU27. The ambitious emissions reduction goals outlined in the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 package necessitate not only the massive renovation of building stocks, but also reconstruction of heat generation and supply systems. With 76 % of the EU building stock located in urban areas, the renewal of urban heating systems is crucial. An easy-to-use methodology has been developed for managing long-term renovation programmes and regularly assessing renovation projects, thereby forming a comprehensive dynamic vision on the progress. This methodology enables flexible, rapid and, at the same time, sufficiently accurate and objective analysis of the potential and benefits of various heating system renovation projects and their variants at the pre-design stage, as well as their comparison according to efficiency. It employs a limited number of open indicators and does not require specialised knowledge in thermal physics, economics and/or construction. The developed methodology provides insights into (1) achievable heat consumption and primary energy savings, (2) reduction of dominant CO2 emissions, (3) changes in heating tariffs and costs, and (4) required investments. The methodology is intended for use by: (1) municipalities to streamline sustainable planning and management of urban heating systems and to facilitate interaction with owners of buildings and local heating systems, and (2) national authorities monitoring the implementation of national programmes under Fit for 55 .

The article presents a sensitivity analysis of the carbon footprint for different modes of transporting neodymium magnets over a selected route, in the context of their environmental impact and sustainable development. Neodymium magnets, widely used in modern technologies such as wind turbines, are essential for renewable energy sources, making the selection of environmentally optimal transportation crucial. The calculations included road, rail, inland waterway, and air transport, using available emission calculators, which allowed for an analysis using averaged emission indicators for each mode of transport. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted with the SimaPro program to verify the consistency and accuracy of the results. The findings indicated that rail transport, with access to low-emission infrastructure and a reduced carbon footprint per unit of mass, is the most efficient option for CO2 emissions reduction, whereas air transport, despite its speed, generates the highest emissions per ton of cargo, making it the least environmentally friendly alternative. A t-test analysis was also conducted to statistically validate the results for each transportation option.

This paper presents an isolated DC-DC converter with high voltage gain that features an advanced inter-built nanocrystalline-core medium-frequency transformer (NC-MFT). The isolated DC-DC converter with an NC-MFT is specifically designed for applications such as interconnect photovoltaic (PV) systems, DC microgrids, DC loads, and DC buses, where voltage gain is one of the essential issues to consider. The NC-MFT inside the DC-DC converter is designed with a new approach that not only provides isolation but also contributes to achieving high efficiency and a higher step-up ratio. The high efficiency of the converters contributes to the integration of PV systems into DC microgrids. The converter yields a high voltage conversion ratio of 16.17. The experimental results obtained at 41.8 V/676 V and 275 W for the prototype revealed high efficiency (95.63% at full load). The experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and simulation, confirming that the converter achieves the main objective of high voltage conversion and high efficiency. These results will contribute to the interest in the use of this type of energy and its impact on the reduction in CO2 emissions.

Abstract An investigation of the performance and emissions of premixed combustion of a synthetic paraffinic kerosene sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) consisting of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) was conducted using a CRDI research engine with ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) as a reference. In a constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC), HEFA exhibited a shorter ignition delay, confirmed by its higher derived cetane number (DCN) at 58.6 compared to ULSD at 48. Further investigation was carried out at 5 bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) with the addition of EGR to control combustion and mitigate NOx. Methanol, a low reactivity fuel, was port fuel injected (PFI) at 50% with HEFA (by mass) and ULSD to investigate its cooling effect on in-cylinder temperatures as a means of mitigating NOx. Combustion pressure for HEFA was found to be greater than ULSD in most cases and occurred sooner. The apparent heat release rate (AHRR) was notably lower for HEFA than for ULSD in most cases, while the addition of methanol resulted in an increased duration of the low temperature heat release region for both HEFA and ULSD. With addition of EGR and PFI, several negative temperature coefficient regions were observed correlating with the pilot, primary, and tertiary direct injections. HEFA saw more than a 10% reduction in NOx than ULSD in CDC. The addition of EGR resulted in further reduction of NOx compared to ULSD at equal operating points. Implementing EGR and 50% methanol PFI with HEFA reduced NOx emissions by over 70% compared to ULSD in CDC. In all studied cases, CO2 emissions for HEFA were slightly reduced compared to ULSD at matched operating parameters, while CO increased compared to ULSD. Lastly, both ULSD and HEFA achieved a combustion efficiency of 97% in CDC at 5bar IMEP. The combustion behavior of the studied HEFA in combination with the emissions reduction suggests potential suitability as a substitute for ULSD in some applications.

The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in order to effectively address the issue of climate change, has critical importance worldwide. To achieve this aim and implement the necessary strategies and policies, the projection of greenhouse gas emissions is essential. This paper presents a forecasting framework for greenhouse gas emissions based on advanced machine learning algorithms: multivariable linear regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting, support vector, and multilayer perceptron regression algorithms. The algorithms employ several input variables associated with greenhouse gas emission outputs. In order to evaluate the applicability and performance of the developed framework, nationwide statistical data from Turkey are employed as a case study. The dataset of the case study includes six input variables and annual sectoral and total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 eq. as output variables. This paper provides a scenario-based approach for future forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions and a sector-based analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in the case country considering multiple input variables. The present study indicates that the stated machine learning algorithms can be successfully applied to the forecasting of greenhouse gas emissions.

Chemical weed control is a significant agricultural concern, and reliance on a limited range of herbicide action modes has increased resistant weed species, many of which use C4 metabolism. As a result, the identification of novel herbicidal agents with low toxicity targeting C4 plants becomes imperative. An assessment was conducted on the impact of 3-cyanobenzoic acid on the growth and photosynthetic processes of maize (Zea mays), a representative C4 plant, cultivated hydroponically over 14 days. The results showed a significant reduction in plant growth and notable disruptions in gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence due to the application of 3-cyanobenzoic acid, indicating compromised photosynthetic activity. Parameters such as the chlorophyll index, net assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), maximum effective photochemical efficiency (Fv&#039;/Fm&#039;), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (ϕPSII), and electron transport rate through PSII (ETR) all decreased. The A/PAR curve revealed reductions in the maximum net assimilation rate (Amax) and apparent quantum yield (ϕ), alongside an increased light-compensation point (LCP). Moreover, 3-cyanobenzoic acid significantly decreased the carboxylation rates of RuBisCo (Vcmax) and PEPCase (Vpmax), electron transport rate (J), and mesophilic conductance (gm). Overall, 3-cyanobenzoic acid induced substantial changes in plant growth, carboxylative processes and photochemical activities. The treated plants also exhibited heightened susceptibility to intense light conditions, indicating a significant and potentially adverse impact on their physiological functions. These findings suggest that 3-cyanobenzoic acid or its analogs could be promising for future research targeting photosynthesis.

Abstract The world needs reliable energy. As an industry, we supply that energy. Moreover, our product is one of the major contributors to increasing atmospheric CO2. Steam assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) technique alone contributes nearly 1.4 million barrels per day of oil production but with a range of steam oil ratios, the effectiveness of this production method is often challenged and seen as having high associated GHG emissions per barrel. We cannot solve this dilemma, but by better understanding the sciences of the reservoir and implementing new technologies at the primary level of production, we can help to be part of the solution. One production enhancement technique, injecting NCG at the late life SAGD wind down process is an effective but challenging operation due to high mobility of the gas and subsequent breakthrough at the production well. A new design of Autonomous inflow control valve's (AICV) can distinguish the difference in viscosity of the fluid, and therefore they can strongly choke and shut the NCG effluents zones as breakthrough occurs in the SAGD production well. The AICV design is truly autonomous based on Hagen-Poiseuille equation and Bernoulli's principle. The AICV is utilizing the difference in flow behavior in a laminar flow restrictor and a turbulent flow restrictor to differentiate fluids based on the difference in pressure drop between oil, water, emulsions, gas, CO2 and steam. This will allow the AICV to choke and/or shut off unwanted water, gas, CO2 and steam coming into the producer well. To understand the AICV behavior for a NCG breakthrough application, a laboratory experiment which illustrate the performance of AICV technology and reference orifice type ICD technology have been conducted. Laboratory experiment results illustrate the performance difference between AICV technology and reference orifice type ICD technology illustrate a significant, of more than 80% reduction, in NCG choking performance, when compared to the ICD type nozzle. The laboratory test performance results are used in reservoir simulations. Reservoir simulation results show that utilizing AICV in late life SAGD production well can significantly reduce NCG production and improve the recovery of SAGD operation by retaining more of the injected gas within the reservoir. In today's engineer's toolbox, a variety of new technologies exist that can help achieve the targets for late life SAGD. The new editions to Flow Control Device (FCD), Autonomous Inflow Control Valve (AICV), has evolved to the point that operators can operate in late life in a way that could demonstrate clear economic efficiencies with a reduced environmental impact.

Batch-cell provides a quick way to test the performance of an electrochemical catalyst. A fundamental understanding of physics behind the batch-cell operation could shed light on parameters that either could be fine-tuned to get the desired performance, or by careful optimization, overall performance of the batch-cell could be improved. Therefore, a 1-D numerical model is developed to study the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) in a batch-cell with three different working electrode configurations: solid electrode (SE), gas diffusion layer electrode (GDLE), and glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Experimental results of two Cu-based catalysts are used to obtain the electrochemical kinetic parameters, and to validate the numerical model. Simulation results demonstrate that, both gas diffusion layer electrode, and glassy carbon electrode with porous catalyst layer (CL) have a superior performance over solid electrode in terms of total current density (TCD). Furthermore, we studied the impact of key parameters of batch-cell with glassy carbon electrode such as boundary layer thickness, catalyst layer thickness, catalyst layer porosity, electrolyte nature, and strength of an electrolyte on total current density at a fixed applied cathodic potential of -1.0 V vs RHE.

In order to organize the multiple actions the Universidad Javeriana had been developing for the sustainable management of its campus, a strategic plan was structured. The plan is structured in five major programs: water resources, energy, biodiversity, recycling and reduction of CO2 emissions. For the definition of these five programs we were inspired by the contributions of the thematic structure of Green Metrics, the recommendations of the Encyclical Laudato Si and the SDGs. In turn, each program is broken down into sub-programs, projects and sub-projects. Each program also includes cross-cutting strategies articulated in sub-programs which are broken down into research projects, semester projects, graduate work and theses. Also, sub-programs for disseminating initiatives and entrepreneurship are considered. The planning instrument is taken to the detail of operational planning, using the Gantt Chart. A team coordinates the coordination of the different programs and meets weekly to review its progress. The plan was presented and approved to the University's Steering Committee, and the document has been incorporated into the University's Strategic Plan. It is also being used to link professors from civil engineering, electronics and architecture careers who invite students to carry out semester or degree work on topics that strengthen campus execution.

Abstract The metaturbidite‐hosted, ∼380 Ma Dufferin gold deposit, Meguma terrane, northeastern Appalachian Orogen (Nova Scotia, Canada) is an orogenic gold deposit with mineralized saddle reef‐type quartz veins hosted by metasandstones and black slates in a tightly folded anticline. Together with native gold inclusions, genetically related hydrothermal carbonaceous material (CM) in veins occurs as pyrobitumen in cavities and along fractures/grain boundaries proximal to vein contacts and wallrock fragments. Integrating several microanalytical methods we document the precipitation of gold via coupled fluid‐ f O 2 reduction (via interaction with CM) and pH increase. These changes in fluid chemistry destabilized gold bisulfide complexes, leading to efficient Au precipitation from a gold‐undersaturated (0.045 ± 0.024 ppm Au; 1σ; n = 58 fluid inclusions) aqueous‐carbonic fluid (H 2 O‐NaCl‐CO 2 ± N 2 ± CH 4 ). The proposed mineralization mechanism is supported by: (a) a complementary decrease in Au and redox‐sensitive semimetals (As, Sb), and increase in wall rock‐derived elements (i.e., Mg, K, Ca, Sr, Fe) concentrations in fluid inclusions with time; (b) a corresponding decrease in the X CO2 , consistent with CO 2 removal via reduction/respeciation and late carbonate precipitation; and (c) gold embedding in, or on, the surface of CM inside mineralized cavities and fractures. Despite mineralizing fluids transporting low concentrations of Au far from saturation, precipitation of gold was locally evidently high where such fluids interacted with CM, contributing to the overall gold endowment of Meguma deposits. This work re‐emphasizes CM as a potential prerequisite for efficient gold precipitation within the overall genetic model for similar orogenic metasedimentary settings globally where the presence and/or role of CM has been documented.

The present study explores incorporating biodiesel made from sunflower waste cooking oil (SWO) into petroleum diesel in varying concentrations. It examines various aspects, including energy, exergy, emissions, exergoeconomic and enviroeconomic factors, and the sustainability index (SI). Experimental findings indicate that higher biodiesel proportions in blends decrease thermal efficiency (ηth). Notably, D90WB10 (90% diesel and 10% biodiesel) demonstrates superior ηth, ranging from 14.98 to 29.37% across loads, closely resembling diesel (D100) values. Blends show significant reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (by 10.59–48.23%) and in unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions (by 10.34–27.58%) compared to D100 at full engine load. D90WB10 exhibits a maximum exergy efficiency of 27.22% at full load among all blends. Better exergoeconomic efficient fuel is indicated by lower relative cost difference (CR). Among all tested fuels, D100 exhibits the lowest CR value of 2.21. D100 exhibits the least annual CO2 emissions cost, whereas pure biodiesel (WB100) shows the highest, ranging from 55.46 to 144.86 USD/year across loads. The SI values for all tested fuels range between 1.281 and 1.393 at full engine load. Results indicate that blends of SWO biodiesel and diesel, particularly D90WB10, offer promising performance akin to diesel without significant modification.

Climate change has gained prominence following the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to keep it under 1.5 degrees Celsius. This agreement stresses the importance of collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience against climate impacts. In June 2023, the global average surface temperature reached a record high, with subsequent months also setting heat records. Mitigating global warming's adverse effects, such as rising temperatures and extreme weather changes, requires significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts in the energy sector have led to a decrease in CO2 emissions from 40.6 million tons in 2018 to 127.67 million tons in 2023. These efforts include enhancing energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy, and implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies In Indonesia, CCS regulations are outlined in Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 2 of 2023. CCS involves the capture, transport, injection, and permanent storage of carbon emissions. The management of state-owned assets related to CCS falls under the Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 140/PMK.06/2020, which addresses the transfer, utilization, and valuation of upstream oil and gas assets. This paper discusses the role of state asset management in the implementation of CCS in Indonesia, examining current regulations, challenges, and future prospects.

To investigate corrosion and resulting changes in the sealing performance of premium connections in corrosive CO2 environments, we carried out a simulation analysis of their secondary current distribution and structural mechanics based on multi-physics field coupling. A finite element calculation model of Ф88.9 mm × 6.45 mm taper–taper premium connections (steel grade P110) was established using COMSOL6.0 general software. By analyzing corrosion laws under different environmental parameters, five internal pressures and tensile displacements were set. We simulated premium connections under different operating conditions using a secondary current distribution module. To investigate the distribution of the corrosion current density in premium connections under different operating conditions, the sealing performance before and after corrosion was quantitatively evaluated using a seal strength index. The results show that the current density is higher at the torque shoulder of the premium connections, which is more susceptible to damage. As the internal pressure increases, the current density in the inner wall of the column increases, and on the threads, the current density is highest at the rounded corners of the root of the thread, which is also more likely to be damaged. Under different internal pressures, although the sealing strength of the premium connections meets the sealing criterion, the corroded ones show a significant reduction in sealing performance. The results of this study provide a reliable theoretical basis for research on sealing premium connections in corrosive environments.

Traffic congestion is a growing concern in urban centers worldwide, leading to significant delays, particularly for emergency vehicles such as fire trucks and ambulances. This not only increases emergency response time but also the risk of life and property loss. To address this issue, our research introduces a traffic control system that prioritizes emergency vehicle egress and mitigates intersection congestion. Other than validation through simulation, the system’s efficacy is further substantiated by real-world hardware implementation. The system employs an access point (AP) at intersections to receive location and direction data from approaching vehicles. Emergency vehicles are given precedence, while non- emergency vehicle data is used to adjust traffic light durations, thereby optimizing the traffic flow. The simulation results demonstrate the system’s reduced lane opening times and average waiting periods for emergency vehicles. Advancing from simulation to application, we have executed a real-world hardware validation at a high-traffic intersection. This phase entailed the precise installation and calibration of the necessary hardware components, transitioning from theoretical models to practical, operational technology. The hardware setup confirms the system’s practical viability and offers a more comprehensive assessment of its impact on traffic efficiency and emergency response times. This dual approach of simulation and hardware validation provides a thorough evaluation of the system’s capabilities, establishing a foundation for future traffic management solutions. Additionally, the implementation of the system leads to a notable reduction in CO2 emissions at intersections, contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.

Abstract The Compression Ignition of Directly Injected Natural Gas (CIDI NG) offers a potential 25% reduction in CO2 emissions due to its high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio compared to diesel, while achieving ultra-low PM formation with high efficiencies and load capability. The primary challenge of a CIDI NG engine is achieving suitable ignition temperatures, upwards of 1150K, and in-cylinder conditions required for the stable ignition and combustion of late cycle high pressure direct injection of the fuel over a wide operating range. This experimental study investigates CIDI NG combustion in a heavy-duty Single Cylinder Research Engine (SCRE). The SCRE uses a combination of ignition-enhancing technologies targeting the required conditions, including an increased compression ratio, intake charge heating, thermal barrier coatings, EGR, and NG pilot injection. Additionally, charge mixing is promoted through the refinement of the piston bowl geometry, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced soot formation. This study shows the effect of the implemented hardware technology (CR, Bowl Geometry, Thermal Barrier Coating) on the combustion at key operating conditions (low, medium, high load, high-efficiency operation, low emissions) of the NG CIDI engine. Stable combustion and engine operation were demonstrated over a wide load from 5.5 bar to a peak load of 25 bar IMEPg, and a maximum indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) of 48.8% at a load of 15.2 bar IMEPg was achieved. The work conducted with the single cylinder research engine shows that this operation is feasible and can become commercially available in the future.

Abstract To meet future energy sustainability and carbon neutrality requirements, disruptive changes to the current energy mix are expected. Renewable fuels, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), could play an important role in this context. To assess the potential of HVO, further quantitative research analyses are still required in order to emphasize the benefits (and drawbacks, if any) from a global perspective, rather than limiting the investigation to a single topic (e.g., emissions). For this purpose, HVO and conventional diesel were compared, in this study, running initially the engine with the same (diesel-oriented) calibration, before being optimized using purposely developed fuel-specific calibrations. In terms of exhaust pollutant emissions, HVO showed the potential to substantially reduce engine-out emissions of soot, HC and CO at low loads, while differences in exhaust emissions at higher loads proved to be mainly determined by the amount of oxygen available in the combustion chamber, rather than the specific characteristics of the fuels. HVO also demonstrated reductions in tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions, due to lower fuel consumption, even though the primary benefit of renewable fuels should be highlighted in a larger well-to-wheel analysis. In addition to emission analyses, since extensive investigations on the area of vibroacoustic behavior of engines running on renewable fuels are rare in the literature, a thorough comparison between regular diesel and HVO was carried out on this aspect. In this preliminary activity, the acoustic analysis focused solely on combustion noise, which was extracted by using dedicated signal processing techniques. This approach allowed the authors to focus on the noise contribution that is specifically influenced by the fuel characteristics. Furthermore, the vibrations of the engine block were evaluated. The results showed slightly lower levels of HVO in terms of both noise and vibrations.

Determining regional and global carbon cycles hinges on investigating the dynamic characteristics and influencing factors of soil respiration in various types of natural grasslands located in arid regions, and these characteristics are important indicators for assessing the structural and functional health of grassland ecosystems. Such investigations also provide theoretical support for carbon sink monitoring, energy conservation, emission reduction and low-carbon development in the western arid zone and are important for obtaining an in-depth understanding of the carbon cycle, as well as for ecosystem management, restoration and the reconstruction of arid areas. In this study, during the growing season (from May to October) of 2022, the LI-8100A automated soil CO2 flux system was used to measure the soil respiration rate (Rs), temperature from 1.5 m above the surface to depths of 5–25 cm (T, T5, T10, T15, T20 and T25) and the soil moisture content (SM) at a depth of 20 cm in four types of grasslands: lowland meadow, alpine meadow, temperate desert steppe and temperate steppe desert. Five replicates were established for each plot, and the responses of Rs to T and SM were fitted to construct the optimal regression model. The results revealed that (1) the daily average soil respiration was highest in the lowland meadow (0.07 to 5.76 μmol·m−2·s−1), followed by the alpine meadow (−0.57 to 0.95 μmol·m−2·s−1), the temperate desert steppe (−0.45 to 3.0 μmol·m−2·s−1) and the temperate steppe desert (−1.29 to 1.61 μmol·m−2·s−1); (2) the soil respiration rates of the four grassland types were significantly correlated with the temperature in the 5–15 cm soil layer, and the best model was an exponential function; the peak values generally appeared between 13:00 and 17:00 (h), with the minimum values at 2:00 or 8:00 (h); the maximum value was observed in July–August, and the minimum value was observed in October; and the soil respiration in the lowland meadow was higher than that in the other three types of grassland during the same period. The average variation intensities of the soil respiration from May to October were as follows: temperate steppe desert (91.78%) > temperate desert steppe (76%) > alpine meadow (58.77%) > lowland meadow (43.93%). (3) The partial correlation analysis revealed that when soil temperature was used as a control, the correlation between SM and soil respiration in the four types of grasslands changed, and the coefficient of determination (R2) increased to varying degrees, explaining up to 80% of the variation in the soil respiration in the lowland meadows. The correlation between soil respiration and the SM normalized to 10 °C explained up to 93.8% of the variation in soil respiration; the two-factor fitting equations revealed that the model with soil temperature and SM was superior to the single-factor model with either soil temperature or SM.

We thank Panza et al. (2024) for their interest in our work (Bogard et al., 2023) and the editors for fostering this dialogue on the effects of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) on motor learning and metabolic cost. We hope this ongoing exchange continues to advance our understanding of how AIH enhances human motor performance. Below, we address the key points raised by Panza et al. (2024), including our statistical approach, potential mechanisms behind metabolic adaptations and future directions for optimizing AIH protocols. Panza et al. (2024) raised concerns regarding our use of post hoc analyses without significant group or interaction effects. We argue that within-group post hoc analyses are warranted when a significant main effect, such as a learning phase, is observed. These analyses are essential for identifying phase-dependent changes that might otherwise be overlooked. During split-belt walking, features of spatiotemporal co-ordination (Buurke et al., 2022; Leech et al., 2018), walking kinetics (Mawase et al., 2013; Ogawa et al., 2014; Sombric & Torres-Oviedo, 2020) and net metabolic power (Finley et al., 2013; Sánchez et al., 2017, 2021) adapt on different timescales. Moreover, initial asymmetry (Malone & Bastian, 2014) and the degree of asymmetry (Leech et al., 2018) are important predictors of the magnitude of spatiotemporal adaptation. Without within-group analyses, phase-dependent improvements could be missed, particularly during these initial learning phases when motor patterns are more variable. Furthermore, although larger sample sizes would increase sensitivity to detect interaction effects, our observation of significant group effects and greater within-AIH group changes suggests that the AIH group exhibited more substantial alterations in both walking mechanics and net metabolic power. The relationship between walking mechanics and metabolic adaptations during motor learning is incompletely understood (Finley et al., 2013; Sánchez et al., 2017, 2019) because net metabolic power continues to decrease even after spatiotemporal co-ordination plateaus during prolonged split-belt walking (Sánchez et al., 2021). We agree with Panza et al. (2024) that correlational analyses between motor and metabolic outcomes would be valuable. Our subsequent analyses revealed a positive correlation between reduced net metabolic power and spatiotemporal asymmetry during both motor learning and motor savings (Fig. 1) (Bogard, Hembree, et al., 2024). Although these correlations were significant (P < 0.05), it is important to note that biomechanical adaptations alone may not fully explain changes in net metabolic power. Panza et al. (2024) proposed that mitochondrial adaptations might underlie the observed reductions in net metabolic power post-AIH. Because reductions in net metabolic power following AIH had not been previously reported, our study was not designed to examine specific mechanisms such as mitochondrial function. To comprehensively address this hypothesis, future mechanistic studies should be conducted without the confounds of split-belt locomotor adaptation. Determining the 'optimal' dose of AIH remains another critical area for future research. Panza et al. (2024) questioned the intensity of hypoxia in our study, noting that our nadir oxygen saturation ( S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ ) values (65.4 ± 4.7%) were lower than other studies. Notably, our protocol utilized 90 s hypoxic bouts, consistent with prior work showing improvements in motor function after incomplete spinal cord injury (Hayes et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2021; Trumbower et al., 2012). This methodological difference may explain the lower S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ values compared to studies that utilized 60 s hypoxic bouts (Christiansen et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2022). It is also important to clarify that we reported the lowest S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ attained during a single AIH session, not the average SpO₂ across the 15 hypoxic cycles; for example, average S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ of 81% in Christiansen et al. (2018). Furthermore, our study was conducted at a higher altitude in Boulder, Colorado, compared to the near-sea-level locations of previous studies, such as Chicago, Illinois (Christiansen et al., 2018) and Sydney, Australia (Finn et al., 2022). Although we utilized a validated low-oxygen air generator to deliver 9% O2 (Tan et al., 2020), the reduced atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes may further increase the hypoxic burden, driving the observed response (Panza et al., 2023). Importantly, lower nadir S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ levels in our study did not elicit adverse effects and were effective in enhancing motor learning and metabolic efficiency. Another point raised was whether hypercapnia could further enhance motor plasticity. Prior studies indicate that maintaining CO2 levels at (Vermeulen et al., 2020) or above baseline (Tester et al., 2014) is important for facilitating phrenic long-term facilitation (Welch et al., 2022). Rodent studies show that AIH induces plasticity through serotonin-dependent 5HT2A receptor pathways (Bach & Mitchell, 1996; Baker-Herman et al., 2004). Notably, 5HT2A receptors also mediate CO2-induced arousal (Buchanan et al., 2015). Thus, hypercapnic AIH may stimulate central chemoreceptors more effectively, thereby enhancing 5HT release (Welch, 2021). However, the broader application of hypercapnic AIH to non-respiratory motor systems remains unclear. Poikilocapnic AIH has been effective in improving walking performance after incomplete spinal cord injury (Hayes et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2021; Trumbower et al., 2012) and improving motor learning (Bogard et al., 2023) and performance fatigability (Bogard, Pollet, et al., 2024) in able-bodied individuals. Unlike respiratory plasticity (Puri et al., 2021), other non-respiratory motor plasticity does not appear to depend on CO2. Nevertheless, we agree that examining the effects of hypercapnic AIH on motor outcomes is a necessary next step. Standardizing AIH dosing may be essential for comparing responses across multiple sites, advancing our understanding of its effects on motor performance and its interaction with rehabilitation training. Considerable variability exists in how AIH protocols are applied across studies, including duty cycle and total number of sessions, all of which probably influence motor outcomes. Reporting end-tidal O2 as a readout of hypoxic intensity could enhance reproducibility. Future research should systematically examine these dosing parameters and their effects on human motor performance. Once again, we appreciate the careful review of our work by Panza et al.
