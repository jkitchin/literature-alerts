Efficient synthesis of CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via photochemical CO2 reduction holds promise for achieving carbon neutrality but remains challenging. Here, we present rare‐earth dual single atoms (SAs) catalysts containing ErN6 and NdN6 moieties, fabricated via an atom‐confinement and coordination method. The dual Er‐Nd SAs catalysts exhibit unprecedented generation rates of 1761.4 μmol g–1 h–1 and 987.7 μmol g–1 h–1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH, respectively. Through a combination of theoretical calculation, X‐ray absorption near edge structural analysis, aberration‐corrected transmission electron microscopy, and in‐situ FT‐IR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Er SAs facilitate charge transfer, serving as active centers for C−C bond formation, while Nd SAs provide the necessary *CO for C−C coupling in C2H5OH synthesis under visible light. Furthermore, the experiment and density functional theory calculation elucidate that the variety of electronic states induced by 4f orbitals of the Er SAs and the p−f orbital hybridization of Er−N moieties enable the formation of charge‐transfer channel. Therefore, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of *CO adsorption in achieving efficient conversion from CO2 to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via a novel rare‐earth‐based dual SAs photocatalysis approach.

Technological advances in motorized transportation are progressing rapidly, making motorized vehicles the main mode of transportation. The increasing number of motorized vehicles in society results in a significant increase in exhaust emissions. Combustion in vehicle engines is not always perfect, producing exhaust gases containing compounds harmful to human health, such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This study investigates the effect of variations in piston dome shape on exhaust emissions in a 100cc internal combustion engine using RON 90 fuel. The goal is to find the optimal compression ratio to produce cleaner exhaust emissions. The research data are presented in tabular form and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and graphs. The results showed a significant reduction in CO and HC emissions at all engine speeds (1000, 2000, 4000, and 5000 rpm) with variations in piston dome shape. The reduction in CO emissions ranged from 55.07% to 85.73%, while the reduction in HC emissions ranged from 54.14% to 86.10%. These results suggest that variations in piston dome shape can be an effective solution to minimize harmful exhaust emissions in internal combustion engines.

Abstract As part of the reduction and elimination of anthropogenic emissions, carbon capture, and storage (CCS) has been applied in recent decades. One option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions GHG is to store carbon dioxide CO2 in deep saline aquifers. Due to their abundance and large capacity, deep saline aquifers make excellent storage sites due to their potential for long-term sequestration. In early 2006, in Salah Gas Krechba field in Algeria became the world's first onshore saline aquifer to begin sequestration. This paper will focus on new insights into surface CO2 monitoring. We will discuss the introduction of geochemical imaging as an emerging surface technique to monitor CO2, recently adopted to investigate and detect tracer gases leaks injected in 2007 from neighboring wells and the cap rock. In the following few pages, we will summarize the geochemical imaging survey process from the implementation design, samples signature measurement to chemical analysis using the sophisticated statistical geo-chemical methods in the final interpretation stage. As a conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of the geochemical data has allowed the Krechba team to investigate the CO2 leakage areas in the field and demonstrates to be an efficient valuable, and accurate method for CO2 monitoring

This study examines the effects of methanol–diesel blends on the emissions of a diesel engine, concentrating on carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HCs), and particulate matter (PM). Using a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine at varying torque settings (2 N m–6 N m), significant reductions in CO, CO 2 , HC, and PM emissions were observed with increasing methanol content. CO emissions reduced by up to 81.8%, CO 2 by up to 64.2%, HC by up to 80.4%, and PM by up to 23.5% with the MD11 blend. NOx emissions initially increased but decreased by up to 20% at higher torques with the same blend. These results highlight the environmental benefits of methanol–diesel blends and the need for effective NOx reduction strategies.

Abstract The oil and gas industry are under increasing pressure to minimize its environmental footprint, with drilling fluids being a significant contributor to operational emissions and waste. Traditional Oil-Based Muds (OBMs), despite their effectiveness in drilling operations, pose substantial environmental risks due to their disposal challenges and high carbon footprint. In response, High-Performance Water-Based Muds (HPWBMs) have been developed, promising reduced environmental impact and improved performance. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of HPWBMs in reducing emissions and waste while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The primary objective of this research is to compare the environmental and economic impacts of HPWBMs and OBMs through comprehensive field trials and laboratory tests. By analyzing drilling performance, cost-per-lateral-foot, waste management, and emissions, this study seeks to establish HPWBM as a viable and sustainable alternative to OBMs in the oil and gas industry. Field trials were conducted in North Central Texas and the Permian Basin, involving the drilling of 26 wells—13 using HPWBM and 13 using OBM. The North Central Texas case study focused on an operator's challenge of drilling 10,000-15,000’ lateral wells at TVDs of 3,800-4,800’. In the Permian Basin, Wolfcamp horizontal wells were drilled to evaluate performance. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as drilling fluid cost, lateral cost per foot, and days per well were measured. Emissions were calculated using a carbon calculator, and laboratory tests assessed rheological properties, lubricity, and thermal stability. The results indicated that HPWBM systems not only reduced drilling costs by 18.2% but also significantly lowered CO2 emissions and hazardous waste generation. In the North Central Texas case study, the use of HPWBM resulted in cost savings of over $100,000 per well, with significant reductions in disposal costs, OBM logistics, base-fluid costs, motor realignment fees, and pit cleaning expenses. The environmental footprint and carbon emissions were notably reduced, with CO2 emissions for HPWBM wells averaging 386.1 metric tons compared to 710 metric tons for OBM wells. In the Permian Basin, the average fluids cost per foot for HPWBM wells was $6.02 compared to $7.04 for OBM wells, and the average number of lateral days was reduced to 4.92 days compared to 11.50 days for OBM wells. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of HPWBMs, demonstrating their superior environmental and economic performance over traditional OBMs. The significant reduction in CO2 emissions and hazardous waste, combined with cost savings and improved operational efficiency, highlights the potential of HPWBMs to transform drilling practices in the oil and gas industry. The findings support the broader adoption of HPWBMs, promoting sustainable and cost-effective drilling operations that align with global sustainability goals.

This study investigates the substitution of cerium (Ce) with mischmetal (MM) in cast Al-MM alloys, focusing on microstructure, hardness, tensile and compression properties, creep resistance, and coarsening resistance. Al-MM alloys with various MM compositions (Ce, Ce-50La, Ce-33La, and Ce-27La-19Nd, weight percent) exhibit near-eutectic and hyper-eutectic microstructures for Al-9MM and Al-12MM compositions, respectively, with similar as-cast hardness (~525 MPa). All Al-9MM alloys show tensile yield stress ~55 MPa, ultimate tensile strength ~130 MPa, and fracture strain ~8%.The microstructural and mechanical properties consistency demonstrates the flexibility of MM compositions in Al-MM alloys. Al-9MM exhibits excellent coarsening resistance, with minimal hardness reduction when exposed to 300 and 350 C for up to 11 weeks, and a modest ~15% hardness reduction at 400 C for 8 weeks, outperforming eutectic Al-12.6Si and Al-6.4Ni alloys. Additionally, Al-9MM shows higher creep resistance at 300 C compared to most precipitate-strengthened Al-Sc-Zr and solid-solution-strengthened Al-Mg/Mn alloys, but is outperformed by eutectic-strengthened Al-6.4Ni and Al-10Ce-5Ni alloys.The effect of casting cooling rate is investigated through wedge casting: Al-9Ce transitions from hypo- to hyper-eutectic as cooling rates decrease, while Al-12Ce consistently shows hyper-eutectic microstructures. Al11Ce3 lamellae become finer and more closely spaced with increasing cooling rates. Al-9Ce maintains steady hardness at high to moderate cooling rates but shows reduced hardness at lower rates, whereas Al-12Ce shows no change in hardness.With a 15% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, Al-Ce alloys where Ce is replaced with MM offer comparable mechanical properties and enhanced environmental benefits, highlighting the potential of MM as a sustainable alternative.
