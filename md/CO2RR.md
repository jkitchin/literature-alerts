Abstract The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) can achieve carbon recycling through renewable electrical energy. Before releasing the full potential of eCO 2 RR, the electrocatalysts still need improvement in terms of catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability. Two‐dimensional (2D) crystalline materials show a high aspect ratio with well‐defined crystal structures, which are promising electrocatalysts for eCO 2 RR. In this review, we briefly discuss the typical 2D electrocatalysts for eCO 2 RR. Subsequently, we provide a summary of the different strategies to improve the catalytic performance of 2D crystalline electrocatalysts for creating and modulating active sites. Finally, we end this review with the current challenges and future opportunities of 2D crystalline materials in the eCO 2 RR.

Abstract Paired electrolysis offers an auspicious strategy for the generation of high‐value chemicals, at both the anode and cathode, in an integrated electrochemical reactor. Through efficient electron utilization, routine product misuse at overlooked electrodes can be prevented. Here, an original paired electrosynthetic system is reported that can convert CO 2 to ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) at the cathode, and water to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) at the anode under a single pass of electric charge. Amongst various investigated copper (Cu) nanomorphologies, the bespoke mixed Cu nanowire/nanoparticle catalyst recorded a peak C 2 H 4 Faraday efficiency ( FE ) of 60% following 370 h of electrolysis at 200 mA cm −2 , while the tailored boron‐doped diamond (BDD) anode accumulated an unprecedented ≈1% w/w of H 2 O 2 in 4 m K 2 CO 3 upon applying 300 mA cm −2 for 10 h. When paired, the dual C 2 H 4 ‐H 2 O 2 electrochemical cell attains a combined FE of 120% for 50 h at 200 mA cm −2 , a combined energy efficiency (EE) of 69%, and a 50% decrease in the overall electrical energy consumption (EEC) compared to the individual electrosynthesis of C 2 H 4 and H 2 O 2 .

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is sensitive to the microenvironment surrounding catalytic active sites. Although the impact of changing electrolyte composition on CO2 reduction kinetics in aqueous electrolytes has been studied intensively, less is known about the influence of the electrochemical environment in non-aqueous solvents. Here, we present data demonstrating that organic alkyl ammonium cations influence catalytic performance in non-aqueous media and describe a physical model that rationalizes these observations. Using results from a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational techniques, we argue that the interfacial electric field present at the catalyst surface is sensitive to the molecular identity of the organic cation in the aprotic electrolyte. This is true irrespective of solvent, electrolyte ionic strength, or the supporting electrolyte counter anion. Our results suggest that changes in the interfacial field can be attributed to differences in the cation-electrode distance. Changes in the electric field strength are consequential to CO2R to CO as they modify the energetics of the kinetically relevant CO2 activation step.    

    

## Carbon-Supported Silver Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO

The work described in this thesis was aimed at understanding the influence of structural properties of silver catalysts supported on carbon for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. This goal was achieved by rationally designing, characterizing and testing cathode materials. This enabled a correlation between material properties and the catalytic performance. Chapter 1 describes the potential benefits of electrochemistry and electrocatalysis in the context of global warming. The CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to value-added chemicals was described, including the effect of different metal electrodes and buffer electrolytes. Specifically, a background is given on the CO2RR to CO over silver electrocatalysts, and the properties of carbon electrodes, based on literature. In chapter 2, the effect of surface-modification of carbon-based electrodes on the reduction of CO2 to CO is systematically treated. The surface chemistry of the electrodes was characterized with acid-base titration, potentiometric titration and XPS. The basic surface properties (high point of zero charge) of the N functionalized carbon catalyst led to an increased CO production with respect to the O-functionalized and reduced carbon materials. The CO turnover frequency per surface group for pyridinic groups was higher than for O-containing groups. This study demonstrated the possibility to tune the surface properties of carbon materials to enhance the ability of the electrocatalyst to reduce CO2 to CO. In chapter 3, the effect of silver nanoparticle size on the CO2 reduction to CO is discussed. Using the surface modification methods described in chapter 2, control over the ligand-free silver particle size was achieved by tuning the surface properties of the carbon supports. It was demonstrated that the silver particle size, in the range of 10 to 30 nm, decreased by increasing the density of O-containing group on the support. The small nanoparticles (11 nm diameter) effectively steered the selectivity towards CO, even greater than the selectivity achieved by bulk silver electrodes under the same conditions. In chapter 4, the aim was to suppress the hydrogen formation over the high surface area carbon support by functionalizing the surface of the support with alkylamines. The effect of the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain on the HER suppression and CO selectivity was investigated. Alkylamine functionalization successfully suppressed H2 evolution, while at the same time promoting CO production. This resulted in a 1 to 2 H2 to CO ratio for the catalyst functionalized with hexylamine, more favorable than for the pristine carbon-based catalyst (benchmark), able to generate only a 3.3 to 1 H2 to CO ratio. In chapter 5, the catalytic properties of oxide-derived silver nanowires, are explored. XRD and XPS analysis confirmed that by selecting the final potential during the oxidation procedure, both different silver oxidations states and different nanowires roughness were achieved as a function of the oxidation potential. This surface-modification procedure enhanced the catalytic properties of the nanowires. The active surface-normalized CO partial current density increased 3.7-times when the pristine nanowires were oxidized to 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl in basic electrolyte solution.

Electrochemical co-reduction of CO2 and nitrates presents a promising alternative for urea production. However, the current electrochemical synthesis of urea faces challenges related to low selectivity and production rates. The development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts is the key to performance improvement of urea electrosynthesis. This minireview primarily focuses on the rational design of catalysts, starting with a mechanistic overview. In addition, the advancement of electrolyzers for urea electrochemical synthesis is also discussed aiming to articulate guiding principles of achieving high-rate production reaching industrial relevant level in the future.

Protecting human health is one of the fundamental goals of continuous air quality improvement. Considering the same sources of CO2 and air pollutants emissions, their emission control measures often have a certain degree of synergistic emission reduction effects To balance the costs and policy efficiency, policy makers should assess the synergistic benefits of CO2 emission reduction when formulating air quality improvement strategies. Aimed at the air quality improvement strategy targeting WHO-III level (i.e. 15 μg/m3) for PM2.5 in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, this study evaluates the synergistic CO2 reduction effects and the associated health benefits from this strategy which includes a range of air pollution prevention and control measures. The results of the study show that promoting the attainment of WHO-III for PM2.5 in the PRD region can bring about 74 Mt of synergistic CO2 emission reduction, resulting in an 18% reduction of CO2 emissions in the PRD compared to 2017. Among various measures considered, industrial restructuring, power supply transition and industrial energy consumption transformation exhibit the most pronounced synergistic effects. Therefore, these measures are recommended to be prioritized and promoted in the next stage of air pollution prevention and CO2 emission reduction. Furthermore, when the PM2.5 concentration in the PRD region reaches the WHO-III level, the number of PM2.5-related deaths will be estimated to reduce approximately 5.5 thousand compared to that in the current policy scenario. Through continuous structural transformation and emission reduction efforts, it not only facilitates the decline in regional PM2.5 concentration but also helps more regional residents to live in an environment with a relatively low PM2.5 concentration. In addition, in order to reduce the health impacts of PM2.5, it is recommended that the government should guide people to change their production and living styles in order to reduce pollutant emissions from anthropogenic activities.

We report the development of bismuth (Bi) gas diffusion electrodes on a polytetrafluoroethylene‐based electrically conductive silver (Ag) substrate (Ag@Bi), which exhibits high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate of over 90% in 1 M KOH and 1 M KHCO3 electrolytes. The catalyst also shows high selectivity of formic acid above 85% in 1 M NaCl catholyte, which has a bulk pH of 2‐3 during ECR, at current densities up to 300 mA cm‐2. In 1 M KHCO3 condition, the Ag@Bi maintains a formate FE above 90% for at least 500 hours at the current density of 100 mA cm‐2. We found that Ag@Bi catalysts degrade over time due to the leaching of Bi in the NaCl catholyte. To overcome this challenge, we deposited a layer of Ag nanoparticles on the surface of Ag@Bi to form a multi‐layer Ag@Bi/Ag catalyst. This designed catalyst exhibits 300 hours of stability with FE for formic acid ≥ 70% at 100 mA cm‐2. Our work establishes a new strategy for achieving the operational longevity of ECR under wide pH conditions, which is critical for practical applications.

Abstract Precisely designing asymmetrical structure is an efficient strategy to optimize the performance of metallic catalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Herein, a transient high-density current induced by pulsed discharge is used to rapidly construct graphene aerogel (GAs) supported asymmetric Cu cluster catalysts. Cu atoms decomposed by CuCl 2 are converged on graphene surfaces in GAs together with oxygen originating from the intense current and instantaneous high temperature. The atomic and electronic structures of Cu nanoclusters exhibit asymmetric distribution due to lattice distortion and O-doping in Cu crystals. Typically, in CO 2 reduction reactions, the selectivity and activity of ethanol are related to the asymmetric structure and strong interfacial interaction of Cu-O/C moieties, exhibiting an ideal Faradaic efficiency (ethanol 75.3% and C 2+ products 90.5%) at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Meanwhile, the benefit of the strong interaction between Cu nanoclusters and GA supports, the catalyst exhibits long-term stability. In situ XAFS reveals that the Cu 4 -Cu/C 2 O 1 interaction displays the effective active sites in CO 2 RR. The pathways of corresponding products and the reaction mechanism on Cu 4 -Cu/C 2 O 1 moieties are revealed through the in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the calculation of density functional theory. This work gives a new solution to solve the challenge for balancing the activity and stability of asymmetric-structure catalysts toward energy conversion reactions.
