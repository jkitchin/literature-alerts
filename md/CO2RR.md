Given the increasingly severe global climate change and energy crisis, the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into very valuable chemicals has been proposed as an attractive solution. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) represents a remarkably efficient pathway for reducing CO2 under mild conditions. Metal cluster-based crystalline materials (MCMs) have garnered significant interest in the area of CO2RR because of their elevated concentration of active sites, tunable backbone structures, and excellent stability. These materials enable precise control of metal valence states and charge transfer pathways, offering a variety of reduction pathways for CO2RR. Herein, we examine the utilization of MCMs in eCO2RR in recent years. We cover the fundamental principles of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the synthesis approaches for these materials, and the connection between structural characteristics and catalytic performance. Additionally, the paper delves into the challenges and opportunities presented by MCMs for enhancing CO2RR efficiency and selectivity. Herein, we aim to provide researchers with a new perspective on MCMs in the field of eCO2RR, thereby improving understanding of the relationship between structure and performance. Ultimately, this work seeks to advance the technology for eCO2RR, contributing significantly to sustainable energy production and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.

The hangman structure plays a critical role in determining the reaction rates of molecular CO2 electrocatalysis through constructing pendant functional groups in secondary coordination spheres of metal active sites. However, achieving hangman structures commonly requires complicated asymmetric synthesis. It is necessary to search for simple alternative strategies to develop hangman molecular electrocatalysis with realization of the concept of green chemistry. In this work, we report the synthesis of hangman molecular electrocatalysts based on the noncovalent π–π interaction between cobalt (Co) phthalocyanine nanotubes and 1-aminopyrene. It promoted the kinetics of interfacial inner and outer sphere electron transfer on the complex and chemisorption of *COOH and *CO species through interaction with both Co sites and pendant amine groups in a bridge geometry. The resultant Co sites afforded a very high turnover frequency of 4.37 s–1 at an overpotential of 0.29 V for electrochemical CO2 to CO conversion and thus afforded an industrial interest current density being steady at 350 mA cm–2.

Selectivity is an essential aspect in catalysis. At present, the improvement of the selectivity for complex reactions with multiple pathways/products, for example the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), can usually be achieved for only one pathway/product. It is still a challenge to reversibly modulate the selectivity between two reaction pathways or products of the CO2RR by one catalyst. Here, we propose the reversible modulation of selectivity between two products via spin crossover. By employing first-principles calculations, six spin crossover molecular catalysts are found among 17 kinds of transition metal embedded porphyrin derivatives (ppy_TM), where the changes in axial ligand configurations can reversibly switch the spin state of catalysts between high spin and low spin. For ppy_Os and ppy_Ru, the alteration in spin state can effectively influence the reduction of CO2 into either formic acid or carbon monoxide by changing the relative stability of the key intermediates *COOH and *HCOO.

Achieving a carbon-neutral society requires strategies that seamlessly integrate environmental sustainability with economic viability. Solid oxide electrochemical reactors (SOERs) hold the potential to concurrently recycle CO2 while synthesizing high-value propylene from low-cost gases using surplus renewable electricity. However, existing SOER designs face significant challenges in slow reaction kinetics and instability. We present evidence that Fe-Ni-Ru alloy@FeOx core-shell nanoparticles on the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.4Ni0.05Ru0.05O6-δ electrode of SOER substantially enhance electrochemical CO2 reduction at the cathode, and propane conversion to propylene and ethylene at the anode through the promotion of active oxygen species at the surfaces. The formation of core-shell nanoparticles lowers the activation energy of polarization resistance from 2.1 eV to 0.82 eV, facilitating high current densities and 150 h of stable SOER operation with an 80% selectivity for propylene and ethylene production. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this enhancement is due to the reduced activation energy for dissociative CO2 reduction on the surface of Fe-Ni-Ru alloy@FeOx core-shell nanoparticles. These results show the potential of the self-organized core-shell nanoparticles in SOERs for economical CO2 recycling, offering a promising approach in the pursuit of a carbon-neutral future.

The reduction of carbon dioxide to valuable chemical products could favor the establishment of a sustainable carbon cycle, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Developing efficient catalysts plays a vital role in the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) process, but with great challenges in achieving a uniform distribution of catalytic active sites and rapid mass transfer properties. Hierarchical porous materials with a porous hierarchy show great promise for application in CO2RRs owing to the high specific surface area and superior porous connection. Plenty of breakthroughs in recent CO2RR studies have been recently achieved regarding hierarchical porous materials, indicating that a summary of hierarchical porous materials for carbon dioxide reduction reactions is highly desired and significant. In this paper, we summarize the recent breakthroughs of hierarchical porous materials in CO2RRs, including classical synthesis methods, advanced characterization technologies, and novel CO2RR strategies. Moreover, by highlighting several significant works, the advantages of hierarchical porous materials for CO2RRs are analyzed and revealed. Additionally, a perspective on hierarchical porous materials for CO2RRs (e.g., challenges, potential catalysts, promising strategies, etc.) for future study is also presented. It can be anticipated that this comprehensive review will provide valuable insights for further developing efficient alternative hierarchical porous catalysts for CO2 reduction reactions.

With the rapid growth of the world population and economy, the greenhouse effect caused by CO2 emissions is becoming more and more serious. To achieve the “two-carbon” goal as soon as possible, the carbon dioxide reduction reaction is one of the most promising strategies due to its economic and environmental friendliness. As an analog of graphene, monolayer h-BN is considered to be a potential catalyst. To systematically and theoretically study the effect of O doping on the CO2 reduction catalytic properties of monolayer h-BN, we have perform a series of first-principle calculations in this paper. The structural analysis demonstrates that O preferentially replaces N, leading to decreasing VBM of monolayer h-BN, which is conducive to improving its capability for CO2 reduction. The preferential CO2 adsorption sites on monolayer h-BN before and after O doping are the N-t site and B-t site, respectively. O doping increases the adsorption strength of CO2, which is favorable in the further hydrogenation of CO2. During the conversion of CO2 into CO and HCOOH via a two-electron pathway and CH3OH and CH4 via a six-electron pathway, O doping can reduce the energy barrier of the rate determining step (RDS) and change the key steps from uphill reactions to downhill reactions, thus increasing the probability of CO2 reduction. In conclusion, O(N)-doped h-BN exhibits the excellent CO2 reduction performance and has the potential to be a promising catalyst.

Στο πρώτο μέρος της, η διατριβή στοχεύει στη μελέτη του καινοτόμου διαλύτη αλλαγής φάσης (ΔΑΦ) S1N/DMCA για δέσμευση διοξειδίου του άνθρακα (CO2) από απαέρια βιομηχανικών διεργασιών με απορρόφηση μετά την καύση. Ο καθιερωμένος ως διαλύτης αναφοράς, μονοαιθανολαμίνη (ΜΕΑ) 30 % κ.β., είναι επιθυμητό να αντικατασταθεί από άλλους πιο προηγμένους, καθώς χαρακτηρίζεται από ορισμένα κρίσιμα μειονεκτήματα που επιβαρύνουν τη διεργασία με σημαντικό οικονομικό κόστος. Τα μειονεκτήματα της ΜΕΑ εντοπίζονται κυρίως στις υψηλές ενεργειακές απαιτήσεις για την αναγέννηση, στη μειωμένη αντίσταση έναντι οξείδωσης καθώς και στην αυξημένη διαβρωτικότητα. Οι ΔΑΦ υγρού – υγρού διαχωρίζονται σε δύο φάσεις όταν αγγίξουν ένα κρίσιμο επίπεδο φόρτωσης CO2 ή / και θερμοκρασίας. Από τις σχηματιζόμενες φάσεις, η λεγόμενη «υδατική» είναι εξαιρετικά πλούσια σε CO2 ενώ η λεγόμενη «οργανική», είναι πτωχή σε CO2 και γι’ αυτό, μπορεί να εξαιρεθεί από τη διεργασία της αναγέννησης. Επομένως, οι ΔΑΦ επιτρέπουν μειωμένη ογκομετρική και μαζική παροχή διαλύτη προς τη στήλη αναγέννησης, απαιτώντας, μάλιστα, και μειωμένη θερμοκρασία για την αναγέννηση τους. Σε αυτή τη βάση οι διαλύτες αλλαγής φάσης έχουν τη δυνατότητα να αντιμετωπίσουν το βασικό μειονέκτημα της ΜΕΑ, που είναι το μεγάλο ενεργειακό κόστος της αναγέννησης. Επιπλέον, επειδή οι ΔΑΦ είναι μίγματα πρωτοταγών ή δευτεροταγών (δι)αμινών με τριτοταγείς αμινες, παρουσιάζουν συνήθως αυξημένη λειτουργική χωρητικότητα σε σύγκριση με τη ΜΕΑ, γεγονός ωφέλιμο για την ευρύτερη οικονομική βιωσιμότητα μιας μονάδας δέσμευσης CO2. Ωστόσο, ελάχιστοι ΔΑΦ έχουν διερευνηθεί σε κλίμακα ωριμότερη από την εργαστηριακή. Μέχρι σήμερα‧ μόλις τρεις έχουν διερευνηθεί υπό βιομηχανικά ρεαλιστικές συνθήκες σε πιλοτικές μονάδες επιπέδου τεχνολογικής ωριμότητας 5 και άνω (≥ TRL 5) (είναι συντομογραφικά οι DEEA/MAPA, DMX και 3Η), από τους οποίους ο τελευταίος είναι εμπορικός και ο δεύτερος οδεύει προς εμπορική αξιοποίηση. Η βιβλιογραφία γύρω από αυτούς τους διαλύτες προσφέρει ελάχιστες τεχνικές λεπτομέρειες για την πιλοτική διεργασία και τα φυσικοχημικά χαρακτηριστικά των διαλυτών. Σχετικό κενό στη διεθνή βιβλιογραφία εντοπίζεται, επίσης, όσον αφορά στη μελέτη της επίδρασης των ρυπαντών που απαντώνται στα βιομηχανικά απαέρια, όπως τα οξείδια του θείου και αζώτου (SOx, NOx), επί της διφασικής συμπεριφοράς. Για τους παραπάνω λόγους η ανάπτυξη προηγμένων διαλυτών αλλαγής φάσης και η προσπάθεια κλιμάκωσης της τεχνολογικής τους ωριμότητάς τους είναι ακόμη πολύ χρήσιμη και επίκαιρη, ενώ δρα και υποστηρικτικά προς την ευρεία εξάπλωση των συστημάτων δέσμευσης διοξειδίου του άνθρακα. Ειδικότερα, μάλιστα, η αξιολόγηση της συμπεριφοράς των «πρωτοεμφανιζόμενων» διαλυτών σε (μικρότερη) πιλοτική κλίμακα, όπου αντιμετωπίζουν για πρώτη φορά συνθήκες που θα αντιμετώπιζαν στο πεδίο, είναι ζωτικής σημασίας, καθώς παρέχει πρώιμες πληροφορίες σχετικά με την απόδοση που αναμένεται να επιτύχει αυτός, μετέπειτα, σε πιο ώριμες εγκαταστάσεις. Το μίγμα S1N/DMCA δεν έχει δοκιμαστεί ξανά σε πιλοτική κλίμακα, ενώ και η βέλτιστη σύσταση του (αναλογία συστατικών και ολική συγκέντρωση) είναι προς διακρίβωση. Η παρούσα μελέτη συμβάλλει στην αύξηση του επιπέδου τεχνολογικής ωριμότητας του μίγματος από την εργαστηριακή κλίμακα (TRL 3) σε πιλοτική διεργασία (TRL 4-5). Η διερεύνηση έγινε σε δύο πιλοτικές μονάδες κλιμακούμενης πολυπλοκότητας. Με παραμετρικές μελέτες διερευνήθηκαν δύο συγκεντρώσεις (2 και 3 mol/L) και δύο μορφές (καθαρό και μετά από προσθήκη ρυπαντών στην υγρή φάση), του μίγματος S1N/DMCA. Η διερεύνηση συμπεριέλαβε τρείς συγκεντρώσεις που αντιστοιχούν σε τρία είδη εκπομπών (5, 9 και 12 % κ.ο. CO2), πέντε παροχές απαερίων (7, 8, 10, 12 και 14 L/min) και σε μια πληθώρα αναλογιών τροφοδοσίας υγρού/αερίου στη στήλη απορρόφησης (λόγος L/G). Η σύγκριση με τη ΜΕΑ βασίστηκε σε τρείς κρίσιμους δείκτες, συγκεκριμένα α) απόδοση διεργασίας απορρόφησης (ως προς κυκλική χωρητικότητα και ρυθμό απορρόφησης), β) απόδοση διεργασίας εκρόφησης (ως προς ενεργειακή απαίτηση εκρόφησης και ρυθμό εκρόφησης) και γ) διαβρωτικότητα (ως προς συσσώρευση μεταλλοϊόντων λόγω διάβρωσης και μεταβολή φυσικών ιδιοτήτων). Ταυτόχρονα, η γενικότερη εμφάνιση της διφασικής συμπεριφοράς και η ικανότητα διατήρησής της υπό τις διαφορετικές λειτουργικές συνθήκες συμπεριλήφθηκε, επίσης, στους δείκτες απόδοσης καθώς η αξιολόγηση έγινε για πρώτη φορά σε πιλοτική κλίμακα, χωρίς προηγούμενη εμπειρία. Κατά την πρώτη φάση της διερεύνησης, το μίγμα S1N/DMCA μελετήθηκε σε πιλοτική κλίμακα για πρώτη φορά. Η συγκεκριμένη μονάδα (Pilot 1) δεν διέθετε αναβραστήρα, αλλά υπήρχε παροχή θερμότητας κατά μήκος της στήλης αναγέννησης σε δύο συγκεντρώσεις με συνθετικό απαέριο που περιείχε CO2/N2. Η μελέτη ανέδειξε την ανώτερη απόδοση του μίγματος S1N/DMCA 3 mol/L συγκριτικά με το μίγμα S1N/DMCA 2 mol/L ως προς την ποσότητα του απορροφούμενου CO2, την κυκλική χωρητικότητα και την αναλογία όγκου των φάσεων. Τα πρώτα αυτά αποτελέσματα καθόρισαν ότι το μίγμα S1N/DMCA 3 mol/L θα προχωρούσε για αναλυτική διερεύνηση και συγκριτική μελέτη ως προς τη ΜΕΑ. Τα μετέπειτα πειράματα έδειξαν ότι μετά το διαχωρισμό, η οργανική φάση καταλάμβανε ποσοστό 30 % του ολικού όγκου, εξασφαλίζοντας ανάλογη μείωση της ογκομετρικής παροχής προς τη στήλη αναγέννησης, ενώ ήταν εμπλουτισμένη σε αμίνη (75 % κ.β.) και διατηρούσε πολύ χαμηλή φόρτωση (0.05-0.11 mol CO2/kg). Αντιθέτως, η υδατική φάση, καταλαμβάνοντας περίπου 70 % του συνολικού όγκου ήταν εξαιρετικά πλούσια σε CO2 (1.6 mol CO2/kg) και διατηρούσε μέτρια περιεκτικότητα σε αμίνη (25-32 % κ.β.). Έπειτα από σύγκριση με τη ΜΕΑ το μίγμα S1N/DMCA 3 mol/L φάνηκε να εξασφαλίζει μια «στιβαρή» συμπεριφορά στη διεργασία δέσμευσης, διατηρώντας έως και διπλάσια κυκλική χωρητικότητα υπό ποικίλες αναλογίες υγρού/αερίου στη στήλη απορρόφησης. Αυτό είναι σημαντικό γιατί αντικατοπτρίζει την καλή συμπεριφορά του S1N/DMCA έναντι της μεταβλητότητας των συνθηκών παροχής και σύστασης απαερίου με τις οποίες αναγκαστικά έρχεται αντιμέτωπο ένα σύστημα δέσμευσης CO2 μετά την καύση επί του πεδίου. Επιπλέον, το μίγμα S1N/DMCA 3 mol/L επιτύγχανε ενεργειακή απαίτηση 45 % μειωμένη συγκριτικά με τη ΜΕΑ, περί τα 2.3 GJ ανά τόνο δεσμευόμενου CO2, σε διάφορες ογκομετρικές παροχές, ενώ η φόρτωση του πλούσιου ρεύματος κινούνταν κοντά στην φόρτωση ισορροπίας ( περίπου 8 % απόκλιση).Σε επόμενη φάση, το μίγμα S1N/DMCA 3 mol/L μελετήθηκε για πρώτη φορά σε πιλοτική μονάδα αυξημένης πολυπλοκότητας (Pilot 2) και υπό βιομηχανικά σχετικές συνθήκες. Η μονάδα αυτή σχεδιάστηκε και κατασκευάστηκε στα πλαίσια της παρούσας διατριβής. Η αλληλεπίδραση διαλύτη-ρυπαντών SOx, NOx προσομοιώθηκε με την προσθήκη θειικού και νιτρικού οξέος σε ολική συγκέντρωση 0.03 mol (H2SO4+HNO3) ανά mol αμίνης και αναλογία 4:1. Χρησιμοποιήθηκε συνθετικό απαέριο αποτελούμενο από CO2/H2O/N2, ενώ η μονάδα διέθετε υγραντήρα και αναβραστήρα ισχύος 1 kW. Σε αυτή την περίπτωση διατηρήθηκαν τα βασικά χαρακτηριστικά του διαχωρισμού : η οργανική φάση διατηρούσε ως 78 % κ.β. περιεκτικότητα σε αμίνη, ενώ η υδατική φάση καταλάμβανε 73-82% του συνολικού όγκου και συνέχισε να διατηρεί περισσότερο από το 95 % του απορροφούμενου διοξειδίου του άνθρακα, επιβεβαιώνοντας έτσι την δυνατότητα αποφυγής αναγέννησης της οργανικής φάσης. Στη συνέχεια ακολούθησαν πειράματα παρουσία ρυπαντών SOx NOx. Η απορρόφηση τους από το διαλύτη προσομοιώθηκε με προσθήκη θειικού και νιτρικού οξέος στην υγρή φάση με ολική συγκέντρωση 0.03 mol οξέων ανά mol αμίνης. Η μελέτη έδειξε ότι η παρουσία των ρυπαντών επηρέασε ελαφρά τη συμπεριφορά και απόδοση του διαλύτη. Η σχετική αναλογία όγκου φάσεων ελαττώθηκε 5 % (κατά μέσο όρο) σε βάρος της υδατικής φάσης. Η κυκλική χωρητικότητα επηρεάστηκε οριακά, παραμένοντας έως και 90 % υψηλότερη από την αντίστοιχη της ΜΕΑ. Υπολογίστηκε ότι ο S1N/DMCA απαιτεί, κατά μέσο όρο, 17 % μεγαλύτερο ύψος πληρωτικού υλικού για να επιτύχει τον ίδιο βαθμό διαχωρισμού απαερίων (90%) συγκριτικά με τη ΜΕΑ, αφού διακρίνεται από πιο αργή κινητική στην αντίδραση απορρόφησης. Αντίστοιχα, για δεδομένο και σταθερό ύψος πληρωτικού υλικού και βαθμό διαχωρισμού 90 %, ο S1N/DMCA απαιτεί περίπου διπλάσιο λόγο υγρού/αερίου στη στήλης απορρόφησης. Παρόλα αυτά, δεν πρέπει να διαφύγει της προσοχής ότι άλλα αποτελέσματα σχετικά με το κριτήριο (β) καταδεικνύουν ότι το μίγμα S1N/DMCA παρουσιάζει ως και 60 % χαμηλότερη ενεργειακή απαίτηση ως αποτέλεσμα της βελτιωμένης αναγεννησιμότητας του και, μάλιστα, η αναγέννησή του έγινε σε χαμηλότερη θερμοκρασία αναβραστήρα (103-105 °C έναντι 120 °C για τη ΜΕΑ). Η αντιπαράθεση των ανωτέρω αποτελεσμάτων με δεδομένα από τη διεθνή βιβλιογραφία έδειξε ότι οι βασικοί δείκτες απόδοσης του μίγματος S1N/DMCA βρίσκονται εντός του εύρους που επιτυγχάνουν άλλοι, αναγνωρισμένοι, διαλύτες αλλαγής φάσης που έχουν αξιολογηθεί σε μονάδες υψηλότερου επιπέδου τεχνολογικής ωριμότητας (TRL 6). Τέλος, πραγματοποιήθηκε μια μελέτη γήρανσης και ταυτόχρονη αξιολόγηση της διαβρωτικότητάς έναντι δοκιμίων SS 316L για το μίγμα S1N/DMCA 3 mol/L και τη ΜΕΑ 30 % κ.β. Η προκαταρκτική αξιολόγηση της διαβρωτικότητας κατέδειξε αφενός ότι, στην καθαρή του μορφή, το μίγμα S1N/DMCA επιδεικνύει βελτιωμένη συμπεριφορά έναντι των επιμέρους συστατικών του και αφετέρου ότι, υπό υψηλή περιεκτικότητα ρυπαντών (0.06 mol (H2SO4+HNO3) ανά mol αμίνης) συγκρατεί 17 % μειωμένη περιεκτικότητα σιδήρου και 30 % μειωμένη περιεκτικότητα νικελίου σε σύγκριση με τη ΜΕΑ. Τα τελευταία είναι συστατικά του ανοξείδωτου χάλυβα που χρησιμοποιήθηκε στην κατασκευή της πιλοτικής μονάδας και τυχόν αυξημένη συγκέντρωσή τους στην υγρή φάση είναι ενδεικτική διάβρωσης. ΤαυτόχροναΣτο δεύτερο μέρος της, η διατριβή στοχεύει στην ανάπτυξη μιας διεργασίας για την αξιοποίηση του CO2 με σκοπό την παραγωγή νανοσωματιδίων ανθρακικών αλάτων σε πιλοτική κλίμακα. Η πιλοτική μονάδα (Pilot 3) στην οποία πραγματοποιήθηκαν τα πειράματα σύνθεσης ανθρακικού ασβεστίου (CaCO3) και υδρομαγνησίτη (4MgCO3Mg(OH)2‧4Η2Ο) σχεδιάστηκε και κατασκευάστηκε, επίσης, στα πλαίσια της παρούσας διατριβής. Τα αντίστοιχα ανθρακικά άλατα συντέθηκαν μέσω ενανθράκωσης αιωρημάτων υδροξειδίου του ασβεστίου (Ca(OH)2) και οξειδίου του μαγνησίου (ΜgO) με καθαρό CO2. Το κεντρικό στοιχείο και καινοτομία της διεργασίας είναι η αξιοποίηση ενός αντιδραστήρα περιστρεφόμενης κλίνης πληρωτικού υλικού (ΠΚΛ). Οι ΠΚΛ έχουν οριοθετηθεί στη βιβλιογραφία ως εξοπλισμός κατάλληλος για την εντατικοποίηση διεργασιών επαφής υγρού – αερίου. Στην παρούσα μελέτη επιβεβαιώθηκε η καταλληλόλητα τους για διεργασίες κρυστάλλωσης με χημική αντίδραση σε αντιδρώντα συστήματα τριών φάσεων (στερεού-υγρού-αερίου). Επιπλέον, αποδείχθηκε η εφικτότητα σύνθεσης υδρομαγνησίτη διαμέσου αυτής της οδού σε ένα στάδιο σε ΠΚΛ.Συμβατικά η σύνθεση νανοσωματιδίων ανθρακικών αλάτων γίνεται σε ογκώδεις αντιδραστήρες (> 50 cm3) ασυνεχούς ή ημισυνεχούς λειτουργίας και πλήρους ανάμιξης, οι οποίοι όμως διακρίνονται από μεγάλους χαρακτηριστικούς χρόνους αντιδράσεων, χαμηλή απόδοση στην δέσμευση και μετατροπή του CO2, μεγάλους χρόνους αναμονής μεταξύ σταδίων επεξεργασίας, νεκρούς χρόνους, και δυσκολία στον έλεγχο των ιδιοτήτων του τελικού προϊόντος, όπως η μορφολογία, το μέγεθος και η κατανομή μεγέθους των σωματιδίων. Για τους παραπάνω λόγους, συχνά οι διεργασίες λαμβάνουν χώρα σε εντατικές συνθήκες θερμοκρασίας και πίεσης, με την ανάλογη δαπάνη ενέργειας και το ανάλογο περιβαλλοντικό αποτύπωμα, ενώ η πραγματοποίηση της κρυστάλλωσης σε συμβατικό εξοπλισμό απαιτεί πρόσθετα ελέγχου της μορφολογίας και του μεγέθους, ή/και παράγοντες επιτάχυνσης της υδρόλυσης των μεταλλοϊόντων από το πρόδρομο υλικό. Στον αντίποδα, οι ΠΚΛ επιτυγχάνουν έως και τριπλάσιο ρυθμό μεταφοράς μάζας μεταξύ φάσεων και δημιουργούν συνθήκες ομογενοποίησης των χρόνων παραμονής της υγρής και αέριας φάσης, και συνεπώς του χρόνου πυρηνοποίησης και ανάπτυξης μεγέθους των σωματιδίων. Γι’ αυτό και είναι σε θέση να αντικαταστήσουν το συμβατικό εξοπλισμό σε διεργασίες κρυστάλλωσης. Λόγω της εντατικοποίησης, με τις ΠΚΛ εξασφαλίζεται μείωση μεγέθους του εξοπλισμού για δεδομένη δυναμικότητα παραγωγής, βελτίωση του ελέγχου επί των ιδιοτήτων του τελικού προϊόντος και ήπιες συνθήκες λειτουργίας.Η παραμετρική μελέτη πραγματοποιήθηκε στη βάση της μεταβολής κρίσιμων λειτουργικών παραμέτρων, όπως αυτές προέκυψαν μετά τη μελέτη της διεθνούς βιβλιογραφίας. Μεταξύ αυτών βρίσκονται η συγκέντρωση του αιωρήματος, η ταχύτητα περιστροφής της κλίνης, η παροχή αιωρήματος και αερίου. Επομένως, τα πειράματα σε αυτό το μέρος της διατριβής διερεύνησαν την επίδραση των συγκεκριμένων παραμέτρων στην σύνθεση των σωματιδίων. Τα πειράματα περιλαμβάνουν αιωρήματα τριών διαφορετικών συγκεντρώσεων α’ ύλης (10, 30 και 50 g/L), τρεις παροχές αερίου (3, 6 και 9 L/min), τέσσερις παροχές αιωρήματος (3.43 – 4.75 L/min) και τέσσερις ταχύτητες περιστροφής (500, 1000, 1300 and 1800 rpm). Για την αξιολόγηση της διεργασίας υιοθετήθηκαν τρείς δείκτες απόδοσης (ΚΡΙ). Συγκεκριμένα α) ποιότητα παραγόμενου σωματιδίου (φάση, μορφολογία, μέγεθος, κατανομή μεγέθους, καθαρότητα), β) χρόνος αντίδρασης μέχρι πλήρους μετατροπής της α’ ύλης σε τελικό προϊόν και γ) αποδοτικότητα χρήσης ή αξιοποίησης του CO2. Για το κριτήριο (α) αξιοποιήθηκε μια πληθώρα αναλυτικών τεχνικών για τα προϊόντα στερεής φάσης (όπως περίθλαση ακτινών Χ, ηλεκτρονική μικροσκοπία σάρωσης, θερμοσταθμική ανάλυση κ.α.), για το (β) αξιοποιήθηκαν μετρήσεις pH, ενώ ο υπολογισμός του (γ) βασίστηκε σε μετρήσεις παροχής αερίου στην είσοδο και στην έξοδο του αντιδραστήρα. Εν γένει, τα αποτελέσματα ανέδειξαν την ύπαρξη συσχετίσεων-συμβιβασμών μεταξύ των ΚΡΙ που υιοθετήθηκαν. Για παράδειγμα, μια τριπλή συσχέτιση παρατηρήθηκε μεταξύ χρόνου αντίδρασης-καθαρότητας προϊόντος-ποσοστιαίας δέσμευσης του CO2. Ο συνδυασμός χαμηλών ταχυτήτων περιστροφής (600 rpm), με υψηλές παροχές αερίου ή αιωρήματος προκαλεί κακή κατανομή του τελευταίου στο πληρωτικό υλικό και μειωμένη διεπιφάνεια υγρού-αερίου, οδηγώντας σε χαμηλότερη ποσοστιαία δέσμευση CO2. Σε υψηλές ταχύτητες περιστροφής (1800 rpm) o ρυθμός μεταφοράς μάζας ενισχύεται σημαντικά, ο χρόνος παραμονής μειώνεται και το μέσο μέγεθος σωματιδίων τείνει να μειώνεται. Με αυτό τον τρόπο, α’ ύλες χαμηλότερης ποιότητας βρέθηκε ότι μπορούν να επιτύχουν ίδια ή ακόμα και υψηλότερο βαθμό απόδοσης στη βάση των τριών κριτηρίων, συγκριτικά με μια α’ ύλη με βελτιωμένα φυσικοχημικά χαρακτηριστικά.Ως προς την σύνθεση νανο-σωματιδίων ανθρακικού ασβεστίου, τα αποτελέσματα έδειξαν την επιτυχή παραγωγή μονοδιεσπαρμένων κόνεων, σχετικά υψηλής καθαρότητας 97.5 – 99.0 %, με ελάχιστο καταγεγραμμένο μέγεθος κρυσταλλίτη τα 45 nm. Τα χαρακτηριστικά των συγκεκριμένων προϊόντων βρίσκονται εντός εύρους εμπορικά διαθέσιμων κόνεων. Με την κατάλληλη προσαρμογή των συνθηκών λειτουργίας αποδείχθηκε ότι η ΠΚΛ μπορεί να επιτύχει έως και 45 % μείωση του χρόνου αντίδρασης, έως και 50 % ελάττωση του εύρους της κατανομής μεγέθους σωματιδίων. Η ποσοστιαία δέσμευση του CO2 σε όλες τις περιπτώσεις ξεπέρασε το 94 %, ενώ όλα τα παραπάνω επιτευχθήκαν σε ήπια θερμοκρασία σύνθεσης (50 °C και 60 °C) και σε ατμοσφαιρική πίεση.Ως προς τα νανο-σωματίδια υδρομαγνησίτη για πρώτη φορά επιτεύχθηκε η σύνθεσή τους σε ένα στάδιο. Τα αποτελέσματα έδειξαν την παραγωγή μονοδιεσπαρμένων κόνεων, αποτελούμενων από δισδιάστατα φυλλόμορφα σωματίδια ελάχιστου καταγεγραμμένου πάχους 31 nm, που ήταν οργανωμένα σε συστάδες, και μεγέθους κρυσταλλίτη 17-22 nm. Τα σωματίδια που συντέθηκαν ικανοποιούν τις προδιαγραφές των εμπορικά διαθέσιμων προϊόντων για τεχνικές εφαρμογές, ενώ παρουσιάζουν ιδιότητες πολύ κοντινές στις προδιαγραφές που ορίζονται από την Ευρωπαϊκή Φαρμακοποιία για προσθήκη σε φαρμακευτικά σκευάσματα. Η, κατά τα άλλα, αργή κινητική των αντιδράσεων ενανθράκωσης του MgO, δεν αποτέλεσε πρόβλημα για τη διεργασία ΠΚΛ. Η ποσοστιαία δέσμευση του CO2 στην ΠΚΛ κινήθηκε στο εύρος 90-94 %, σε αντιπαράθεση με μια συμβατική διάταξη ημισυνεχούς λειτουργίας – πλήρους ανάμιξης, που χρησιμοποιήθηκε σαν διάταξη αναφοράς, όπου δεν ξεπέρασε το 25 %. Παρόμοια και ο χρόνος αντίδρασης ανά γραμμάριο α’ ύλης ήταν μια τάξη μεγέθους χαμηλότερος στην ΠΚΛ συγκριτικά με τη συμβατική διάταξη, ενώ τα εύρη κατανομής μεγεθών σωματιδίων που καταγράφηκαν ήταν 45-63% στενότερα σε σύγκριση με τις κόνεις που συντέθηκαν με συμβατικό εξοπλισμό. Τονίζεται επίσης ότι η σύνθεση έγινε σε πολύ ήπιες συνθήκες (θερμοκρασίες γύρω από την ελάχιστη για παραλαβή υδρομαγνησίτη 55-60 °C και ατμοσφαιρική πίεση) χωρίς τη χρήση πρόσθετων για τον έλεγχο του μεγέθους και της μορφολογίας. Αποδείχθηκε επίσης ότι η ΠΚΛ επιτρέπει τη διεξαγωγή της σύνθεσης με παροχές αερίου – αιωρήματος πολύ κοντά στη στοιχειομετρία αποφεύγοντας τη λειτουργία με μεγάλη περίσσεια που, άλλωστε, επισύρει μεγάλα μεγέθη εξοπλισμού και χαμηλούς βαθμούς μετατροπής του CO2.

There is a growing need to utilize CO 2 and realize a carbon-neutral society from the perspective of environmental problems caused by CO 2 from fossil fuel-based processes. In this trend, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which converts CO 2 to valuable fuels and chemicals with renewable energy, is attracting attention [1] . However, CO2RR has many challenges, including its low product selectivity. In particular, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which occurs at the potential close to the standard electrode potential of CO2RR, reduces the selectivity of CO2RR, especially in aqueous electrolytes such as KHCO 3 [2] [3] . Therefore, we focus on a concentrated electrolyte, which is used as a means of HER suppression in water-based Li-ion batteries [4] , to improve the selectivity of CO2RR. A concentrated electrolyte is an electrolyte with a high salt concentration, which can improve the electrochemical stability of water by creating a specific water environment [5] . Furthermore, due to its high salt concentration, the effect of anions and/or cations may become significant [6][7] . However, there has been no detailed understanding of how the electrolyte concentration affects the complex reaction pathway of CO2RR. Here, we report the effect of concentrated electrolytes on the reaction process of CO2RR by directly observing reaction intermediates in situ while applying the potential. The product selectivity of CO2RR in 22.2, 42.0, and 61.7 mol kg – 1 of concentrated electrolyte was evaluated. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis confirms the suppression of HER in the series of concentrated electrolytes compared to 0.1 M KHCO 3 , a common aqueous electrolyte. In addition, an increase in the Faradaic efficiency of C 2 H 4 was observed in ~ 42.0 mol kg – 1 , implying a concentration-dependent change in the CO2RR reaction pathway (Fig.1). To elucidate the cause of the high C 2 H 4 selectivity, in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), which allows direct observation of the reaction intermediates, was performed. The results showed that as the electrolyte concentration was increased, the peaks at 1400 to 1500 cm – 1 region became more pronounced at low potential. We also observed the difference in the potential dependency for the intensity of CO adsorbates peak at 2100 cm –1 by electrolyte concentration. We will then discuss the effect of electrolyte concentration on the intermediates, unraveling the concentration-dependent change of the C 2 H 4 selectivity. The work highlights the use of concentrated electrolytes to open up additional knobs for tuning the product selectivity of CO2RR, simply by designing an electrolyte component.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) electrochemical conversion is vital because it provides a pathway to efficiently valorize CO2 and incentivize CO2 capture. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is of great interest because it is scalable and can be done at ambient temperature and pressure. However, these reactions are typically performed in water which suffers from undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water breakdown. Aprotic nonaqueous electrolytes can suppress HER and enable a wider range of catalysts for CO2RR. However, water is still needed as a proton source and to stabilize charged intermediates. Here, we study the influence of aprotic electrolyte solvent on modulating the water microenvironment, solvation, and dynamics for CO2RR. Furthermore, we probe changes to the water chemical environment in different aprotic media and the ability of aprotic electrolytes to enhance CO2RR or suppress HER. Our work pushes the field in the understanding of electrolyte solvent and water effects for electrochemical transformations such as CO2RR and HER.

The increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration and the associated rise in global temperatures are major global concerns. One mitigation strategy being studied and employed is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Another widely studied mitigation approach is Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), where CO 2 is utilized as the feed for chemical production. The electro-reduction of CO 2 (eCO 2 RR) is a promising technology that can convert captured CO 2 to key intermediates such as carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene, and ethanol, depending on the catalyst used and its selectivity. Most eCO 2 RR studies use close to pure CO 2 streams as the feed, whereas actual feeds at scale from direct air capture or other capture processes may not be close to 100% CO 2 , and may contain other contaminants. Our work explores eCO 2 RR using feeds that are less than 100% CO 2 but still contain substantial fractions of N 2 and/or O 2 . Specifically, this presentation will focus on developing an electrochemical CO 2 reduction approach using a mixed gas feed comprised of O 2 , N 2, and CO 2 for CH 4 production. To mitigate the detrimental effects of the presence of O 2 on the eCO 2 RR rate and selectivity, we employ an electrochemical method to remove O 2 in the first step, followed by the electroreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 in a membrane electrode assembly cell. This two-step strategy is expected to achieve a higher selectivity for CO 2 to CH 4 than the direct reduction of CO 2 (still in the presence of O 2 ) to CH 4 . This work will also investigate the effects of cell flow pattern design, electrolyte, resilience in the presence of O 2 , and performance of CO 2 to CH 4 over multi-hour runs.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction represents a promising strategy for transforming this ubiquitous greenhouse gas into valuable commodities. Moreover, it offers a solution for storing intermittent renewable electricity by converting CO 2 to chemical fuels. Unlike the formation of hydrocarbons, the reduction of CO 2 to carbon monoxide (CO) involves only two electron/proton transfers, making it a less complex process. Also, CO is a very useful product as it can be used as a crucial feedstock for the production of fuels via the catalytic Fischer-Tropsch process. Nevertheless, the electrocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CO, carried out typically at metals, experiences significant challenges due to changing morphology with time, poor CO 2 RR product selectivity, and unavoidable competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction in aqueous environments. Therefore, attention has also been extended to CO 2 RR at carbon-based catalysts, as carbon possesses a plethora of inherent advantages, including its customizable and stable porous structures, high surface area, low cost, and environmental friendliness. While these properties make carbon highly favorable as a catalyst, it is inactive towards CO 2 reduction in its pure state and must be doped or surface modified to achieve reasonable CO 2 RR kinetics. As an example, nitrogen-doped carbons (N-C) have shown acceptable activity towards the CO 2 RR, [1] attributed to the electronic modulation of conjugated sp 2 carbon atoms by adjacent nitrogen dopants, disrupting electroneutrality by delocalizing π-orbital electrons within the carbon framework and creating active sites for CO 2 activation. Even so, as N-C catalysts require significant overpotentials to attain satisfactory reaction rates and as the Faradaic efficiencies can be low and unstable, there is a pressing need to devise novel strategies to enhance the catalytic efficacy of N-C materials and achieve highly efficient CO 2 -to-CO conversion. To overcome these limitations, a dual-doping approach has been suggested, with the observed enhancement in activity of co-doped catalysts (e.g., N and sulfur) generally attributed to synergistic effects between nitrogen and the secondary atoms. [2] Computational simulations have predicted that the inclusion of sulfur into N-graphene could increase the asymmetrical spin density of the carbon system due to the higher polarizability of sulfur atoms compared to nitrogen and carbon atoms, thereby leading to improved catalytic performance. Moreover, sulfur modification can offer a potentially effective avenue for enhancing CO 2 RR performance over N-C materials by leveraging the electronic contribution from sulfur. [3] However, to the best of our knowledge, there are limited reports on the implementation of sulfur decoration strategies for electrocatalytic CO 2 RR. Our team has been working on a family of fully tunable monodisperse mesoporous carbon sheets, designated as nanoporous carbon scaffolds (NCS), along with colloid imprinted carbon (CIC) powders as carbon support materials. The CIC and NCS materials possess identical ordered monodisperse pore diameters, selected to be anywhere between 10 and 100 nm. These mesoporous carbons present numerous advantages compared to microporous carbons, notably their internal accessibility to solutions and gases, as well as their highly defective surfaces, making them easily modified. Specifically, the NCS offers additional benefits due to its self-supported nature and suitability for conducting fundamental CO 2 RR membrane electrode assembly (MEA) studies. To date, we have successfully N-doped both the CICs and the NCS and are now moving towards co-doping with S. N-doping has been achieved by subjecting the carbons to an NH 3 atmosphere at 800 °C and S-doping is carried out by heat treatment of a mixture of the carbons and benzyl disulfide in Ar. We are also investigating a carbon precursor having intrinsic N and S content to simplify the preparation steps. In this case, the N,S-C catalysts were prepared by ball milling of dry silica particles (85 nm) and Alberta-sourced mesophase pitch. Subsequently, the mixture underwent carbonization at 900 °C for 2 hours, followed by removal of silica using a NaOH solution to yield the final product. CO 2 RR testing of these first generation of N,S doped catalysts has been carried out primarily in CO 2 -saturated bicarbonate solutions in an H-cell, giving an impressive CO Faradaic efficiency of 80% at overpotentials of only 390 mV and maintaining their stability for many hours of polarization. XPS studies are underway to establish a correlation between S, N content and speciation with the electrocatalytic activity and durability of these materials, with CO 2 RR testing also being carried out under flow conditions for comparison.

## (Keynote) Electrocatalysts Design for Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Valorization

There are several materials design strategies that have been utilized with various levels of success for CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to C 1 , C 2 and occasionally, C 3 products (C i denotes the number of carbon atoms in the product of CO 2 RR). Among those Cu based materials take leading role as this class of catalysts is relatively simple to synthesize and implement. 1 Adding co-catalyst in the composite materials allow for regulating of selectivity towards a specific product while sustaining some simplicity of the synthesis and deployment strategies. 2 Alternatively, CO 2 RR can be carried on carbon-based electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed transition metals, stabilized by nitrogen (known as M-N-C). We synthesized a library of nitrogen-doped carbonaceous materials with atomically dispersed 3d transition metals and corresponding metal-free electrocatalysts. The sacrificial support method (SSM) was used yielding catalyst materials of high dispersity and high graphitic content. The resulting electrocatalysts were impurity free, hence allowing a better understanding of the mechanism of CO 2 reduction. By combining the electrochemical results with density functional theory, we were able to separate the electrocatalysts into several categories, based on their CO 2 → COOH ads free energy and their CO ads binding strength. 3 The ‘strong-CO binder’ electrocatalysts ( e.g. Cr, Mn and Fe – N – C) achieved a Faradaic efficiency up to 50% at – 0.35 V vs. RHE (at pH = 7.5, in 0.1 M phosphate buffer). Such Faradaic efficiency was also achieved for a metal-free electrocatalyst, therefore showing the high activity of the metal-free, N-containing, moieties toward the CO 2 reduction reaction. A separate study showed materials hydrophobicity as one of the major factors of metal-free catalysts selectivity. 4 Among the many practical products of CO 2 RR syngas (an H 2 /CO mixture) attracts special attention. Appropriate electrocatalysts, such as the metal–nitrogen–carbon (M-N-C) materials, allow for the production of CO alongside H 2 (from the hydrogen evolution reaction), and thus leads to syngas generation. 5 Selectivity of mono- and bi-metallic (M-N-C, M = Fe, Mo or FeMo) electrocatalysts towards syngas production have been extensively studied. 6 The ratio of the CO:H 2 in the syngas was tuned by modifying the ratio of metallic precursors in the bi-metallic FeMo-N-C catalysts, tailoring the catalysts’ selectivity towards the CO 2 RR or the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Further development of CO 2 RR towards valorization of its products may lay through its integration with bioprocesses. 7 Success of that strategy will rely on the ability of such systems to result in highly selective synthesis of formate, acetate, or propionate as major products. 8,9 Those examples show the path to designer catalyst materials for a desired scalable CO 2 RR-based electrosynthesis technology.

The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has the potential to convert carbon dioxide to higher value fuels and chemicals, offering a pathway for carbon neutral (or negative) synthesis of carbon monoxide, ethylene, and several other compounds. A common challenge for CO 2 RR research is driving the selective CO 2 RR over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This key performance metric is quantified by the catalyst’s faradaic efficiency (FE): the number of electrons that go toward producing a specific product divided by the total number of electrons passed during electrolysis. FE is often determined by gas and liquid chromatography. However, these methods have long response times (minutes to hours) and therefore prevent selectivity analysis in real-time. Instead, rotating ring disk electrodes (RRDE) have emerged as a rapid and sensitive method for quantitative CO 2 RR selectivity measurements with negligible time delays. To date, work has focused on a polycrystalline Au RRDE, especially for bench scale mechanistic studies. The Au disk electrode catalyzes both CO 2 RR and HER, while the concentric Au ring electrode senses the CO produced at the disk and oxidizes it back to CO 2 . By comparing the ring and disk currents, FE CO and FE HER can be determined using the subtraction method. However, comparison across several works have reported a wide range for FE CO values, 60-83%, despite identical conditions: CO 2 saturated 0.1 M NaHCO 3 (pH = 6.8), E disk = -0.6 V vs RHE, and rotation at 2500 rpm [A. Goyal, et al. , J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 142 , 4154–4161 (2020); R. E. Vos and M. T. M. Koper, ChemElectroChem , 9 , e202200239 (2022)]. This work investigates the possible causes of this poor reproducibility in RRDE selectivity measurements by comparing protocols with different electrochemical methods, reagent purities, and glassware cleaning procedures. Most notably, we observed rapid loss of selectivity toward CO production during chronoamperometry measurements. Lastly, we propose operational bounds for RRDE selectivity measurements on Au under CO 2 RR conditions and provide our perspective on next steps for developing this into a robust analytical technique.

As global warming takes place at an unprecedented pace, it becomes increasingly important to develop negative emission (i.e., CO 2 -depleting) technologies to achieve the hoped-for net-zero target in 2050. The electrochemical CO 2 -reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) or formate is expected to be an economically viable approach to close the carbon cycle while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. [1] In this context, palladium (Pd) has been identified as an interesting CO 2 RR-catalyst owing to its ability to selectively produce formate vs. CO in the lower vs. higher overpotential regimes [i.e., at -0.1 to -0.4 vs. -0.5 to -0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively]. [2] To this day, the reasons for this potential-induced change in product selectivity remain poorly understood and a subject of open debate in the literature. In this regard, several publications have suggested that PdH x forms at the negative potentials at which the CO 2 RR takes place, and that this hydride acts as the active phase in the reduction of CO 2 to formate. [3, 4] To elucidate this catalytic mechanism, we have investigated two different types of Pd catalysts: one consisting of dispersed Pd-nanoparticles supported on a carbon black, and a second one in the form of unsupported Pd nanoparticles tridimensionally interconnected into a network structure (i.e., a so called aerogel). [5] To track these materials’ potential-dependent PdH x -formation using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Pd K-edge under CO 2 RR-conditions and link it to their partial current densities (pCDs) towards formate, we employed a newly designed spectroelectrochemical operando XAS flow cell. The latter enables spectral acquisition in a grazing incidence (GI) configuration allowing the use of thin layer electrodes (i.e., with a thickness < 1 μm) which in turn minimizes the accumulation of evolved gaseous bubbles along the CL-thickness, thus avoiding spectral artifacts related to the present of such bubbles. Moreover, the implementation of an ion-conductive membrane to separate the working- and counter-electrode compartments enables the accurate quantification of gaseous products via mass spectrometry and gas chromatography, as well as of liquid products by collecting aliquots of the electrolyte over time (which, in the case of formate, are subsequently analyzed through ion chromatography). Using this combination of spectroelectrochical and analytic techniques, we found that the two catalysts exhibit significantly distinct behaviors, as illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, while for the C-supported Pd nanoparticles the stable pCD towards formate observed at -100 mV and -200mV vs. RHE is accompanied by a quick PdH x -formation (stabilizing at hydride stoichiometries of x ~ 0.6 vs. ~ 0.5, respectively), the unsupported Pd aerogel features a negligible formate- production capability at the same potentials, and the corresponding hydride phases only form gradually in the course of the potential holds and reach x-values of ~ 0.35 and x ~ 0.4, respectively. Moreover, the fact that for the C-supported Pd nanoparticles the higher pCD towards formate observed at -200 mV vs RHE corresponds to a hydride phase with a lower H-content compared that at -100 mV vs RHE indicates an indirect correlation between the formate- production rate and the nanoparticles H-content. In conclusion, these results provide valuable new insights into the important role of the time-dependent formation of PdH x on these materials’ CO 2 -to-formate selectivity.

For decades, global warming has posed a significant environmental challenge worldwide, CO 2 generated by human activities is considered to be a major cause of its escalation. Among the methods to convert CO 2 into high value-added chemicals, like carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) and ethanol(C 2 H 5 OH), electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) at a low temperature has gained considerable attention. Nevertheless, given the high reaction barrier, sluggish kinetics, and diverse pathways involved in CO 2 RR, well-designed electrocatalysts are crucial for facilitating reactions and adjusting selectivity for specific products. Copper (Cu) has garnered the most attention in recent years due to its ability to generate hydrocarbons beyond CO owing to its moderate *CO adsorption energy. However, Cu exhibits a low selectivity for specific products with wide range of hydrocarbons and undergoes the hydrogen evolution reaction which competes with CO 2 RR. Incorporation of Cu-based bimetallic alloys can enhance selectivity by regulating the intrinsic active sites of the material to control the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates. Among many secondary metals, post-transition metals such as tin (Sn), indium (In), and bismuth (Bi) have been proven to be active in CO 2 RR alone, and studies have reported that combining them with Cu selectively produces CO and HCOO - . While antimony (Sb) possessed similar properties, it went unnoticed due to its lack of CO 2 RR activity alone. However, recent studies have revealed that the addition of a small amount of Sb to Cu results in high CO activity. Electrocatalytic assessments are typically performed using a standard three-electrode H-type cell. Due to the limited accessibility of CO 2 by the catalyst, constrained by the solubility of CO 2 (approximately ~34 mM at ambient conditions), the highest achievable operating current density is capped at around ~20 mA cm −2 . In a gas diffusion electrode system, gaseous CO 2 is fed directly to the catalyst, enabling rapid mass transport of CO 2 . Among these methods, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer offers enhanced efficiencies owing to the reduced ohmic resistance inherent in their zero-gap design. In a MEA electrolyzer, the membrane is sandwiched between the cathode and anode catalyst layers on each side. During operation, the cathodic side receives humidified CO 2 but no flowing electrolyte. The anode is typically fed an alkaline electrolyte and commonly consists of a carbon gas diffusion layer with deposited IrO x nanoparticles to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction. Here in, a series of bimetallic Cu X Sb 10-X (X = 0, 2, 5, 8, 10) catalysts with adjustable compositions for CO 2 RR was prepared. Cu X Sb 10-X catalysts were synthesized via direct co-electrodeposition onto a gas diffusion layer (MPL/CP) under the room temperature. Characterization reveals that Cu X Sb 10-X catalysts have a typical morphology consisting of nano-sized particles with well-dispersed Cu and Sb. CO 2 RR tests were performed in a gas flow MEA single cell using humidified gaseous CO 2 and anion exchange membrane (AEM). Unlike Pristine Cu, Cu 5 Sb 5 and Cu 8 Sb 2 , which have major composition of Cu, show CO (72.4%) as a main product at 3.0 V cell . Meanwhile, Cu 2 Sb 8 exhibits enhanced selectivity for CH 4 (49.7%) with a partial current density of 152.1 mA cm -2 , at 3.6 V cell despite pristine Sb having an inability to produce any CO 2 RR product. We assume that Cu serves as the main active site in this catalyst. At the same time, the CO 2 RR selectivity shifts towards CH 4 when the site of Cu decreases and becomes isolated near Sb. Later, in situ Raman spectroscopy will be used to reason that the Cu-Sb interface in Cu weakens the binding energy of *CO. Also, Sb surrounding isolated Cu in Cu 2 Sb 8 promotes the CO 2 RR to CH 4 through enhancing the binding energy of *CHO which is key intermediate of CH 4 reaction pathway.

1. Introduction To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, significant attention has been paid to the development of CO 2 capture and utilization (CCU) technologies in addition to CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Here, electrochemical CO 2 conversion technology in molten salt is considered one of the promising candidates for CCU because it can reduce CO 2 to elemental carbon [1,2]. In recent years, we have been working on the conversion of CO 2 into a variety of valuable carbon materials. For example, we reported the electrochemical synthesis of diamond from molten LiCl-KCl-K 2 CO 3 -KOH [3]. In the present study, we report recent results on the electrochemical synthesis of various carbon allotropes, including diamond, in molten chlorides. 2.Experimental As a typical molten salt among the chloride systems, we used eutectic LiCl-KCl. Cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic electrolysis were performed after adding K 2 CO 3 to the molten salt. For diamond synthesis, KOH was also added to the molten salt. The working electrode was a Ni flag (Φ 3 × 0.1 mm) or Ni plate (5 mm × 10 mm × 0.1 mm), the counter electrode was a glass-like carbon rod, and the reference electrode was an Ag + /Ag electrode. The potential was calibrated with Li + /Li potential. After electrochemical measurements were performed, samples were prepared by potentiostatic electrolysis using the Ni plate electrodes. In the case where CO 2 was used as a raw material, molten LiCl-KCl containing Li 2 O was prepared, and CO 2 and H 2 O were bubbled into it in predetermined amounts, respectively. After electrochemical measurements, potentiostatic electrolysis was performed to prepare samples. The obtained samples were analyzed by SEM, EDX, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. In addition to the LiCl-KCl, we used several other chloride-based molten salts for use at higher temperatures. 3. Results and Discussion For diamond synthesis, CO 2 and H 2 O were introduced into molten LiCl-KCl-Li 2 O at 973 K. Then, CO 2 was converted into CO 3 2− and H 2 O into OH − . Samples were prepared by potentiostatic electrolysis using Ni plate electrodes at 1.0 to 1.2 V (vs. Li + /Li). The charge density was unified to 10 C cm −2 . As an example, optical images of the sample obtained at 1.2 V is shown in Fig. 1. The electrode surfaces were covered with black deposits, but most of the deposits, except for the edges, were detached during the water rinsing. Raman spectra were measured at the points indicated by the crosses in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 2, sharp peaks were observed at 1332 cm −1 , overlapping the spectra characteristic of amorphous carbon. The results indicate that the majority of the product was amorphous carbon, but a small amount of diamond was synthesized electrochemically. On the day of the meeting, we will also present the results obtained in other chloride-based molten salts. Acknowledgment A part of this work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 21K19024.

Among representative examples of semiconducting materials for the selective reduction of carbon dioxide to desired small organic molecules (fuels, utility chemicals), there are transition metal oxides (p-type semiconductors), in particular Cu-based oxides, such as Cu 2 O, CuFeO 2 , CuBi 2 O 4 , CuNb 2 O 6 , CuO and Cu 2 O) that are capable of generating electrons with use of solar visible light. Selectivity of the catalytic systems largely depends on the activing adsorptive (CO 2 ) phenomena and the affinity of catalytic centers to the adsorbed carbon monoxide intermediates leading to their protonation or hydrogenation. Here application of aqueous or water-containing electrolytes is generally preferred. Furthermore, a compromise must be reached between the activity of a catalyst toward hydrogen evolution (water splitting), its ability to promote reductive adsorption of CO 2 and to generate moderate coverages of H atoms capable of stabilizing subsequent reduced intermediates. Our interest concentrates on copper(I) oxides but their practical use requires means of stabilization without poisoning or deactivation. To improve stability against photocorrosion, to assure the sufficient electron-hole pair separation, as well as to increase population of electrons in the conduction band, mixed oxide systems combining the p-type semiconductor (e.g. Cu 2 O) with n-type semiconductors such as TiO 2 , SrTiO 3 or KTaO 3 have been proposed. To meet requirements for practical Cu 2 O-based photocathodes, not only the ability to absorb efficiently visible light and to assure fast interfacial electron transfers but also the stability issues need to be addressed. Contrary to the poor performance of the pristine (bare) copper(I) oxide photocathode, the visible-light-illuminated photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide has been successfully performed using the p-type Cu 2 O-semiconductor (deposited onto the transparent fluorine-doped conducting glass electrode) over-coated with the ultra-thin films of various polymer (poly(4-vinyl pyridine, oligoaniline) or polynuclear type materials (titanium, zirconium and tungsten oxides).. In this respect, ultra-thin films of functionalized carbon nanostructures, supramolecular complexes (with nitrogen containing ligands and certain transition metal sites) or robust bacterial biofilms could also be advantageous. For example, A biofilm formed by a strain of Yersinia enterocolitica ( Y. enterocolitica ) is characterized by high physicochemical stability over a wide pH range (4-10) and temperatures (0-40°C).Also oligoaniline or tungsten oxide over-layers could be fabricated on copper(I) oxide surfaces. Under such conditions, the copper(I) oxide photoelectrode does not change the oxidation state during photoelectrochemical diagnostic experiments. Thus certain robust (not necessarily thin) over-layers could exhibit the effect of stabilization of Cu 2 O against photocorrosion. Among important issues is the ability of CO 2 to undergo adsorption (and activation toward reduction to CO) at both bare and modified surfaces of Cu 2 O. The proposed bi-layered photocathode has been demonstrated to produce such simple organic fuels as alcohols. Introduction of co-catalytic centers, e.g. palladium in a form of supramolecular complexes could also be advantageous.

Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the most prevailing issues that has to be dealt with its main role in global climate change. In order to curtail this issue there are two forms of options to deal with CO 2 emissions currently and that is CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) and CCS(Carbon Capture and Sequestration). CCS operations focus on mitigation through storing the CO 2 underground in reservoirs, but this comes with inherent cost which makes it costly especially at an industrial scale. CCU operations although offer not only CO 2 mitigation but also a marketable product which can then mitigate the cost of operating the conversion process. These CCU operations can work in a variety of ways, but we will focus on the electrochemical pathway which has shown promise as a low carbon emission and low cost pathway when coupled with green electricity. Through this pathway important petrochemicals can be made such as ethylene through use of an AEM. Currently this procedure has been to be prohibitively expensive due in part to a variety of factors from stability, efficiency, Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) design, and even the current price of electricity. In response to this research has been done in order to lower the cost of the MEA, increase its stability, and design a system that maximize production without requiring external ingredients. That is the purpose of the integrated system designed here it allows for the production of ethylene with only the use of water, CO 2 from industrial sources, and Air in order to operate. From this the AEM can then produce ethylene at an industrial scale with only ingredients available on site. The next step is to figure out the required operational parameters for this proposed system in order to achieve current market prices to compete with current petrochemical methods. This is done through the modeling of the reactor system consisting of three reactors while optimizing the reactor design, the operational current density, the ASR (Area Specific Resistance), Faradaic Efficiency, and the price of electricity in order to find the absolute minimums in order to meet the current price (~$1200/metric ton). This is then used to complete an economic assessment in order to find the price of the produced product as a function of the parameters listed above. This will be key in figuring out the key areas of research in order to make this technology a practical industrial process instead of just persisting as a lab scale processes which is the main importance in completing Techno Economic Assessments (TEA).

Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) into multi-carbon products such as ethylene and ethanol offers a promising avenue for both mitigating CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and producing valuable chemicals. Techno-economic assessments indicate that achieving a current density of 300 mA/cm 2 in CO 2 RR to C 2+ products is crucial. Recently, we have made strides in enhancing both current density and selectivity through the utilization of flow systems and the implementation of spatial confinement strategies. Our approach involves synthesizing copper nanoparticles within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to mitigate overpotential and enhance the selectivity of multi-carbon product formation. The confined environment within the CNTs serves to concentrate CO 2 RR intermediates, thereby promoting the activity and selectivity of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. As a result, our composite catalyst demonstrates a Faradaic efficiency of 73.96% and a current density of 591.68 mA/cm 2 for C 2 products at 800 mA/cm 2 . Further enhancing the activity of copper species, we design a tubular metal-organic-framework (MOF)-derived copper catalyst that generates copper nanoclusters within its structure, leveraging the spatial confinement effect to boost the activity and selectivity of CO 2 RR. This catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 71% and a current density of 710 mA/cm 2 for C 2 products at 1000 mA/cm 2 . Analysis of operando Raman spectra, reveals crucial intermediates generated during CO 2 RR, shedding light on mechanisms underlying overall catalytic activity improvements. Through these spatial confinement strategies, we aim to significantly reduce carbon dioxide, advance towards achieving net-zero emissions, and pave the way for the industrialization of CO 2 RR.

ECO 2 RR (Electrochemical carbon-dioxide reduction reaction) is a widespread and most promising strategy for controlling CO 2 emission, global warming, etc. We have developed binder-free copper oxide nanowires (CuO NWs) to address this issue using a conventional synthesis process. The prepared electrocatalyst was confirmed through powder-XRD, high-resolution XPS, and FE-SEM analysis. The EDAX elemental mapping confirmed the presence of Cu and O elements. The CuO NWs showed exceptional activity in the CO 2(g) purged electrolyte system. Moreover, the CuO NWs achieved the maximum current density of in the CO 2(g) medium (56.5 mA cm -2 ), whereas in the N 2(g) medium, it was 33.8 mA cm -2 . In addition, predominant catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability properties are observed; further post-mortem analysis demonstrates the choice of material importance. The present work describes an impressive approach to develop highly active electrocatalysts for selective ECO 2 RR applications.

There is a growing interest in developing high-performance catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to address the increasingly serious impacts of global climate change. In this talk, we report on the design of Cu-based and Co-based bimetallic nanomaterials for the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . The morphology, composition and structure of the synthesized nanomaterials were characterized with various imaging and spectroscopic techniques, including FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, EDX and XPS. The effects of an applied potential on the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 were investigated using various electrochemical methods. The products generated from the CO 2 electrochemical reduction were identified by gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was also employed to monitor the activity of the catalysts and the CO 2 reduction products. The kinetics of the CO 2 reduction reaction at the nanomaterials was further studied using in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The critical roles of nanostructured surfaces in the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 are discussed.

Due to the escalating crisis of global warming, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion has garnered significant attention as a pivotal technology for sustainable energy and chemical processes. However, the challenge lies in its nature as a strong endothermic reaction with substantial activation energy, thus requiring extensive energy input. Therefore, integration with renewable energy sources becomes imperative. In this regard, Photo- and electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) presents promising avenues for converting CO 2 with water (H 2 O) using electricity derived from renewable sources, thereby producing various chemicals and fuels. However, the abundance of H 2 O in the catalytic microenvironment promotes the competing evolution of hydrogen (H 2 ), leading to diminished energy efficiency and selectivity toward CO 2 R products. Additionally, another challenge is to selectively produce valuable multicarbon products (C 2+ products), including C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 5 OH, and C 3 H 7 OH, which hold higher market value and greater market volume compared to single-carbon products (C 1 products) like HCOOH, CO, and CH 4 . Among various CO 2 R catalysts, Copper (Cu)-based materials have emerged as prominent candidates due to their capability to yield C 2+ products with considerable activity and selectivity. Recent studies suggest that catalytic microenvironments significantly influence C 2+ production on Cu-based catalysts. Hence, this presentation aims to elucidate the impact of these microenvironments near Cu catalysts and explore how this knowledge can be effectively applied to design a photocathode for the photo-electrochemical reduction of CO 2 , thereby enhancing the production of C 2+ products.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has the potential to play a key role in addressing major energy and environmental challenges via clean conversion of the atmospheric CO 2 from combusting of fossil fuels into value-added products such as fuels and chemicals. The products generated by CO 2 RR vary depending on the electrocatalyst used at the CO 2 electrolyzer cathode, 1 which calls for the development of more active, stable, and selective CO 2 RR electrocatalysts. Atomically dispersed Ni-N-C catalysts have attracted attention due to their superior selectivity for CO generation. 2 Their activity and selectivity towards CO 2 RR are influenced by the metal center and its local coordination environment in Ni-N-C catalysts. 3 Ni-N-C catalysts derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have multiple advantages including a high specific surface area, customizable pore structures, and controllable morphologies, even after the carbonization treatment at high temperatures. In this presentation, we will focus on ZIF-derived Ni-N-C catalysts using a ligand exchange strategy during ZIF synthesis. These ligand-exchanged ZIFs are synthesized by partially replacing 2-methylimidazole (used in ZIF-8 synthesis) with different imidazole-like ligands for the purpose of obtaining structures with increased porosity. The effects of several parameters, including ligand exchange percentage and pyrolysis temperature for synthesizing Ni-N-C catalysts will be evaluated. We will show how the physicochemical characteristics of the Ni-N-C catalyst, i.e., porosity, hydrophobicity, and density of active sites, can be tuned by varying the synthesis parameters. We will focus in particular on the optimization of porosity and accessibility of CO 2 to the catalyst’ active sites to maximize CO 2 RR rate.

Recent rise in the consumption of fossil fuels have raised the levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere causing global warming 1 . Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) to value-added chemicals at low temperature and ambient pressure using green renewable energy sources has emerged as a propitious technology to realize carbon neutrality and mitigate global warming 2 . Supramolecular assembly of noble metal nanoclusters (NMNC) is one of the alluring areas of modern material science. Nanocluster assemblies formed by integrating NMNC using a crosslinking ligand, are reported to be applied in various applications such as nanodevices and as luminescent sensor materials 3 . Silver nanocluster assemblies (Ag-CAM) are composed of regularly crosslinked silver nanoclusters 4 and were evaluated as cathodic electrocatalysts for CO2RR. In this study, we evaluated the reaction selectivity and structural stability of an Ag-CAM ([Ag 12 (StBu) 6 (CF3COO) 6 (2EB) 3 ] n ; Ag 12 -2EB) crosslinked by linker with triple bonds 5 when used as a cathode electrocatalyst (Figure 1). Synthesized Ag-CAMs were supported onto the surface of commercially available gas diffusion electrode (GDE) by spray coating method (Figure 2). The catalyst-loaded electrodes were attached to a self-fabricated GDE flow cell, and electrocatalytic properties were evaluated. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and Pt mesh was taken as the counter electrode for the electrochemical reactions. Single crystal-XRD and powder-XRD were measured to determine the exact crystal structure, while SEM-EDS was used to characterize the electrode surface to determine the structural stability. We used gas chromatography (GC) and 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to calculate the reaction selectivity and quantify the product concentration. The CO2RR products in outlet gas streams from the gas chamber and electrolytes from the catholyte room were analyzed using GC and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. For silver nanocluster assembly cross-linked with 4,4`-bipyridine ([Ag 12 (StBu) 8 (CF3COO) 4 (BPY) 4 ] n ; Ag 12 -BPY) most of the constituent elements of the aggregate (S, N, F, etc.) were eluted out after performing the electrochemical (EC) reactions up to a voltage of 3.2V. The catalyst structure underwent significant transformations and was confirmed by SEM-EDS analysis with samples before and after EC analysis. However, in EC experiments using Ag 12 -2EB as the cathode electrocatalyst, the structural decompositions were suppressed and the electrocatalyst could withstand long-term use. Figure 3 shows the Faraday selectivity (%) of CO2RR products against the applied potential for Ag 12 -2EB/GDE in 0.1M KHCO3. Carbon monoxide (CO) was the main product obtained from electrochemical CO 2 RR of Ag 12 -2EB and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) could be suppressed when the applied potential was shifted to the negative side. Additionally, regarding the reaction selectivity, it was found that the selectivity was approximately the same regardless of the structure of the crosslinking agent. Knowledge obtained from this study will help to bridge the gap for utilizing Ag-CAMs as novel cathode catalyst materials for electrochemical CO 2 RR experiments. References (1) Liu, Y. Y., Huang, J.

We report on the growth and photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization of single crystal, epitaxial zinc telluride (ZnTe) thin film photocathodes. ZnTe is a II-VI semiconductor that has promising photocathode characteristics, including its suitable band gap alignments to CO 2 reduction potentials, chemical stability, strong p-type character, and is theorized to have surface sites suitable for CO 2 reduction. To gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental charge transport of the reactivity mechanism for ZnTe, we utilized molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow single crystal thin film photocathodes. This work focuses largely on the synthesis and characterization of degenerately-doped ZnTe films on three different gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate orientations: (100), (110), and (111)A. ZnTe thin films with a thickness of 300 nm, grown in the temperature range of 340–360ºC, were doped with nitrogen via an in situ RF plasma source and characterized by RHEED, XRD, AFM, and Hall effect measurements. The epitaxial films exhibited p-type characteristics with doping concentrations of 10 18 to 10 20 cm -3 . Photoelectrochemical stability and catalytic selectivity of the ZnTe photocathodes were investigated in a three-electrode compression cell in a CO 2 -saturated electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO 3 ). Utilizing degenerately doped (100) ZnTe, we have demonstrated high (60%) selectivity for CO 2 reduction to CO in the absence of cocatalysts. Overall, we showed the correlation between the CO 2 R selectivity and ZnTe orientation and this work can be leveraged for developing catalyst-free tandem ZnTe-based photocathodes for carbon dioxide reduction.

The electrochemical co-reduction of nitrate (NO 3 - ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) for the synthesis of urea has drawn much research focus recently because it creates value-added products from environmentally hazardous pollutants. Urea is the major ingredient of fertilizer, that is currently produced through the Bosch-Meiser process starting from ammonia (NH 3 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), in which ammonia is produced through the Haber-Bosch process, leading to significantly high energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. Urea electrosynthesis is a complex 16e - , 12H + transfer reaction with multiple possible by-products such as H 2 , CO, HCOOH, NO 2 - , NH 3 , etc., making the electrocatalyst design toward urea selectivity a big challenge. To reliably quantify the urea produced, we present an updated method for urea quantification using the diacetylmonoxime-thiosemicarbazide (DAMO-TSC) method while excluding the interference of NO 2 - by-product. We believe this method can guide the electrocatalysis community to establish an updated protocol and avoid false positive/overestimating results. We will then present a catalyst designed for urea electrosynthesis consisting of Pd nanoparticles in nanoscale proximity to atomically dispersed Fe-N x sites on a carbon matrix (FeNC). Our group has previously presented Pd nanoparticles and FeNC materials as efficient catalysts for CO 2 and NO 3 - reduction respectively. Their association at the nanoscale demonstrates over 20% urea faradaic efficiency at -0.5 V (vs RHE) with 100% N-selectivity (All by-products contain nitrogen). These very promising results provide us with the baseline to elucidate the role of individual active sites on the C-N coupling mechanism. To this effect, reaction intermediates of CO 2 and NO 3 - co-reduction are investigated by in-situ vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, infrared). This study validates the approach of tuning electrocatalysts through mechanistic studies realizing CO 2 / NO 3 - co-reduction.

CO 2 reduction is an important step in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The utilization of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) realizes high current density CO 2 reduction. However, most of the developed CO 2 reduction catalysts suffer from low Faradaic efficiency when using a proton exchange membrane MEA, due to low local pH surrounding catalysts. Alternatively, with an anion exchange membrane MEA, CO 2 reduction suffers from low conversion efficiency due to carbonate-bicarbonate crossover through the membrane to the anode. For continuously-running CO 2 electrolyzers, the crossover of acids and cations results in low reduction efficiency and flooding of the GDE. We have designed and characterized an asymmetric membrane that prohibits carbonate-bicarbonate crossover, yet can maintain a high local pH surrounding the catalyst. The resulting MEA can achieve high Faradaic efficiency toward CO 2 reduction using developed catalysts with near-zero CO 2 crossover. When using oxygen evolution in the anode, we further developed an ion-blockage strategy to diminish the crossover of acids or cations during long-term operation, maintaining a relatively stable and suitable environment for CO 2 reduction on GDE. The crossover management of carbonate, bicarbonate, protons and cations can lead to a long lifetime high-efficiency CO 2 electrolyzer.

Introduction In recent years, non-metallic catalysts with high efficiency for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction have been reported and have attracted much attention. We have synthesized Ketjenblack ® catalysts co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur by hydrothermal treatment of Ketjenblack and demonstrated their capability for the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. In this study, sulfur mono-doped Ketjenblack (S-KB) catalyst and nitrogen mono-doped Ketjenblack (N-KB) catalysts were synthesized and the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction activity for the catalysts was evaluated using a fuel cell-type electrolytic cell. The S-KB catalyst was obtained by the hydrothermal treatment of Ketjenblack with ammonium sulfide, while the N-KB catalyst was prepared by heat treatment of Ketjenblack in a tube furnace under an ammonia atmosphere. Experimental Catalyst synthesis: 300 mg of Ketjenblack ® (ECP600JD, LION) (KB) was mixed with 10 mL of 0.01 M sodium hydroxide solution, 10 mL of 2-propanol, 10 mL of ammonium sulfide solution (5.0~6.0 wt% as S) and 15 mL of Milli-Q ® water. The mixture was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave vessel (TAF-SR300-SV, Taiatsu Techno Corp.) at 170°C. The product was ground in an agate mortar for about 3 min to obtain the S-doped catalyst (abbreviated as S-KB_processed time). Ketjenblack was heat-treated in a tube furnace under ammonia atmosphere for 60 min, quenched, and ground in an agate mortar for 3 min to obtain N-doped catalyst (abbreviated as N-KB_processed Temp. (℃)). Characterization was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PHI X Tool, ULVAC-PHI). Evaluation of CO 2 reduction: To prepare catalyst inks, each prepared catalyst was mixed with 2-propanol, a 5 wt% Nafion ® 2-propanol solution, Milli-Q water and zirconia balls, followed by shaking. The ink was then sprayed onto hydrophobic-treated carbon paper (TGP-H-060, Toray) at 1 mg cm −2 . For the counter electrode, 38.1 wt% Pt/C (ISHIFUKU Metal Co., Ltd.) was sprayed onto carbon paper (without hydrophobic treatment) with 7 mm diameter holes (9.5 holes cm −2 ) at 1 mg cm −2 . The carbon paper was hot-pressed onto a Nafion ® membrane (NR-212, Dupont) at 135°C to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The MEA was integrated into a fuel cell-type electrolysis cell, as shown in Fig. 1(a), with the working electrode side filled with 1 atm CO 2 , while the counter electrode side compartment was filled with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6). A tube-type RHE was used as a reference electrode (1). The electrolysis was performed at a constant potential of -1.0 V vs. RHE, and the qualitative determination of the products was performed by gas chromatographs (GC-8A, SHIMADZU) equipped with TCD and FID detectors. Results and discussion Heat treatment in a tubular furnace under ammonia flow resulted in the highest percentage of pyrrole-type nitrogen in N-KB_600 and pyridine-type nitrogen in N-KB_700. In S-KB_8h, sulfide-type was the most abundant. The carbon monoxide production rates of both sulfur-doped and nitrogen-doped catalysts were faster than those of pristine KB, suggesting their enhanced carbon dioxide reduction ability (Fig. 1(b)).

In this chapter, photocatalytic systems for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using metal complexes are discussed. To construct efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems, two functions, i.e., redox photosensitizer and catalyst, are required. Metal complexes displaying visible-light absorption and long lifetimes in the excited states might be suitable for redox photosensitizers and redox-active metal complexes having a labile ligand forming a vacant site to activate CO2 can possibly be used as catalysts. Simple mixed systems of them photocatalyze the reduction of CO2. In addition, supramolecular photocatalysts in which they are linked via covalent bonds are also introduced.

This study is dedicated to the development of a two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive designed to optimize the metal joining process to achieve environmental goals, simplify operational steps, and reduce manufacturing costs. Conventional metal joining methods, such as soldering and chemical plating, are not only cumbersome and energy-consuming in terms of steps, but also cause serious environmental problems, including high carbon emissions and the generation of hazardous plating wastewater, which is costly to treat. The two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive proposed in this study is intended to replace these conventional techniques and solve the above problems through a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective bonding method. This innovative bonding technology not only reduces the environmental impact, reduces the process flow of metal joining, and lowers the production cost. First, the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive used in this experiment was cured by room temperature curing. Adhesive refers to the substance that can realize the connecting effect of materials, also known as adhesive or bonding agent. After the adhesive is applied to the surface of the substrate, a certain curing process is required to achieve the bonding of the substrate. This process involves a chemical reaction that hardens the adhesive and forms a strong bond between the two surfaces. In this study, we performed cure time and thickness measurements using a two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive. two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive was able to cure in 45 minutes at 40°C. We measured the thickness of the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive and the results showed an average thickness of 25 µm. This data provides an important reference for this experiment. In Figure 1, a tensile test of a metal sheet is shown. The results show that the metal sheet coated with the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive had a tension of 208 N in the tensile test. This demonstrates the excellent torsional properties of the adhesive in bonding technology., including significant shear strength. Next, a thermal conductivity test was conducted. After keeping the heating plate at 100°C, the metal sheet shown in Figure 2, coated with a two-component copper-metal adhesive, was placed in a 100°C temperature environment for 5 minutes. The test results showed that the temperature of the sheet metal remained at 32°C. This may be due to the adhesive being applied to the metal sheet. This may be due to the excellent thermal conductivity of the adhesive, which can quickly transfer heat from the surface of the sheet metal to the surrounding environment so that the temperature of the surface of the sheet metal is consistent with that of the surrounding environment. In addition, the two-liquid copper-metal adhesive for heat transfer coefficient has been verified by a third party (TECHMAX TECHNICAL CO., LTD) with a thermal conductivity of 87W/mK. This result further confirms the excellent performance of the adhesive in terms of thermal conductivity. This result further validates the excellent performance of the adhesive in terms of thermal conductivity. Finally, the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive was applied to the AI server for adhesion testing. First, the hot plate was heated to 100°C and then the server was left to stand for 10 minutes. During this period, the temperature of the server shown in Figure 3 increased from the initial 33°C to 38°C and remained stable for the next 10 minutes. This process demonstrated the excellent thermal conductivity of the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive used. Eliminates the need to heat the process to cure the adhesive and significantly reduces carbon emissions. The two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive used in this experiment formed a strong bond after natural curing on the bonded surface, and at the same time had excellent heat resistance, high viscosity, and abrasion resistance. Excellent heat dissipation characteristics can be utilized in high power consumption component-to-component adhesives. This type of adhesive is not only excellent in terms of bond strength but also plays an important role in various industrial applications. Figure 1

One of the most challenging aspects of manipulating the flow of fluids in subsurfaces is to control their flow direction and flow behavior. This can be especially challenging for compressible fluids, such as CO2, and for multiphase flow, including both water and carbon dioxide (CO2). This research studies the ability of two crosslinked polymers, including hydrolyzed polyacrylamide and acrylic acid/hydrolyzed polyacrylamide crosslinked polymers, to reduce the permeability of both CO2 and formation water using different salinities and permeability values and in the presence of crude oil under different injection rates. The result showed that both polymers managed to reduce the permeability of water effectively; however, their CO2 permeability-reduction potential was much lower, with the CO2 permeability reduction being less than 50% of the water reduction potential in the majority of the experiments. This was mainly due to the high flow rate of the CO2 compared to the water, which resulted in significant shearing of the crosslinked polymer. The crosslinked polymers’ swelling ratios were impacted differently based on the salinity, with the maximum swelling ratio being 9.8. The HPAM polymer was negatively affected by the presence of crude oil, whereas increasing salinity improved its performance greatly. All in all, both polymers had a higher permeability reduction for the formation water compared to CO2 under all conditions. This research can help improve the applicability of CO2-enhanced oil recovery and CO2 storage in depleted oil reservoirs. The ability of the crosslinked polymers to improve CO2 storage will be a main focus of future research.

Since the Industrial Revolution, massive amounts of generated from human industrial activities have been causing ongoing climate change and environmental impacts on Earth. Hence, there is a substantial body of research aimed at mitigating CO 2 emissions to address climate change. Research on CO 2 reduction has been actively conducted, focusing on electrochemical-based CO 2 conversion capable of operating under high current and long-term conditions. Under high current and prolonged operation, catalyst are influenced by the concentration of CO 2 within the catalytic layer. To investigate the impact of CO 2 concentration, we fabricated reaction zones of flow plates used in zero-gap MEA electrolyzers in both flat and sunken shapes. The two flow plates feature an inlet with a channel to guide the incoming gas to the reaction zone and a channel within the reaction zone to distribute the gas effectively. Both the flat and sunken type feature. Both the flat and sunken shapes contain a reaction zone channel where the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is positioned at the top. However, In the sunken flow plate, gas introduced from the inlet can penetrate towards the GDL side, facilitating enhanced delivery of CO 2 to the catalytic layer compared to flat flow plates. This leads to increased CO 2 activity within the catalytic layer and, simultaneously, offers the advantage of easier water management, a major cause of equipment performance degradation. In this study, we confirm through simulation that the sunken shape in flow plates with serpentine channels in the reaction zone offers advantages in CO 2 activity. Experimentally, we obtained partial current densities of 861 mA/cm 2 and 1 A/cm 2 for silver catalyst and NiNC catalyst, respectively, in the sunken serpentine structure. To analyze the reasons for the increase in these values, which are 34.5% and 18.3% higher respectively compared to the flat serpentine structure, we conducted device water discharge experiments and real-time CT imaging. Through this, we confirmed that water management is more efficient in the sunken serpentine structure. The insights and methods presented in this research are crucial for developing design principles suitable for large-scale industrial electrochemical CO 2 electrolysis. Figure 1

Nanoporous materials and carbon nanotubes are common supports for immobilizing molecular electrocatalysts, but the effects of these nano-supports on catalysis are not well understood. Thus, we developed bis-porphyrin nanocages (M2BiCage) for examining how porosity and interactions with carbon nanomaterials (C60 or C70) affect the CO2 reduction activity of metalloporphyrins. The porous structure of Zn2BiCage was characterized by SC-XRD, and the Fe and Co derivatives were found to adsorb on carbon black to provide inks with excellent accessibilities of the metal sites (~50 %) to H+ and e− even at high metal loadings (2500 nmol cm−2). A complex of C70 bound in (FeCl)2BiCage achieved good current densities for CO formation at low overpotentials (jCO > |5| mA cm-2, η = −330 mV; > |10| mA cm-2, η = −530 mV) with 95 % FE, and Co2BiCage achieved high TOF (~1300 h-1, η = −530 mV) with 90 % FE. Blocking the pore with C60 or C70 improved the activity of the M2BiCages (M = Fe) or had little effect (M = Co), indicating that good catalytic performance of the cages cannot be attributed to porosity. Neither enhanced electron transfer rates nor metal-fullerene interactions appear to underlie the ability of C60/C70 to improve the catalytic performance of (FeCl)2BiCage, in contrast to effects on electrocatalysis often proposed for carbon nano-supports.

The total control of major water pollutants (TCMWP) is a critical strategy for improving water quality in China, with the added benefit of yielding climate-related advantages. This study uses the emission factor method to quantify the reductions in pollutants and carbon emissions resulting from China’s implementation of TCMWP. A synergy scale for pollution and carbon reduction was constructed to assess the co-benefits of reducing the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Furthermore, to account for regional variations in energy structure regulation strategies, whether aggressive or unified, we developed Pollutant Synergistic Carbon Reduction Pathways at the Regional (R.PSCRP) model framework level to evaluate the carbon emission reduction potential of TCMWP during the “14th Five-Year Plan” period. The study revealed that China’s unified TCMWP employs different but highly effective combinations of emission reduction paths across different regions. Notably, new renovations and expansions of wastewater treatment facilities (NRE-WWTFS) and pipeline network construction and renovation (CR-PNK) together accounted for 89.3% of the total emission reduction. The construction of key water pollutant reduction projects plays a significant role in reducing carbon emissions at the district level compared to direct discharge practices. Additionally, indirect emissions resulting from TCMWP implementation account for approximately 50% of the total carbon reduction achieved. By aligning either harmonized or independent energy adjustment targets, regions were able to achieve substantial pollution and carbon reduction benefits, ranging from 7.5 to 8 million tons of CO2-equivalent.

The increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can lead to climate change and adversely affect human health. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to capture CO2 and convert it into a more valuable substance, such as methanol. In this study, we established a tandem system involving dye-sensitized solar cells and photoelectrochemical (DSSC-PEC), which included the PEC zone using CuO/dark TiO2 nanotube array (CuO/dTNA) as the dark cathode where CO2 reduction takes place, and Co-Pi/blue TiO2 nanotube array (Co-Pi/bTNA) as the counter photoanode. For the DSSC zone, N719/TNA was used as the photoanode, I-/I3- electrolyte, and Pt/FTO as the cathode. The tandem system was constructed by connecting the PEC cathode to the DSSC photoanode and the PEC photoanode to the DSSC cathode using silver wire. Under solely visible light induction and water containing sodium bicarbonate electrolyte saturated with CO2, the proposed devise produced methanol at 1.292 μmol/hour.

Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential across all sectors, including the maritime transport industry. Speed reduction is a key short-term operational measure for lowering GHG emissions from ships, and its implementation has already begun. While speed reduction offers significant benefits, particularly in terms of GHG emissions reduction potential, there are concerns about its application, including increased voyage times, an increase in the number of ships required, and the fact that ships may operate in conditions quite different from those for which they were designed and optimized. This study investigates the impact of speed reduction on ship performance in calm water, using a post-Panamax container ship as an example. Numerical simulations of resistance, open-water, and self-propulsion tests were conducted for a full-scale ship and propeller, and the results were validated against extrapolated towing tank data. Hydrodynamic characteristics, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions at various speeds were then estimated. The results indicated that when constant transport work was maintained, yearly CO2 emissions decreased by −16.89% with a 10% speed reduction, −21.97% with a 20% speed reduction, and −25.74% with a 30% speed reduction. This study demonstrates that the classical cubic law for fuel oil consumption and speed dependence is not valid, as the speed exponent is lower than 3. The potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing slow steaming are discussed. Finally, this research contributes to the existing literature by evaluating the CO2 emissions reduction potential of slow steaming.

An advanced photochemical reduction system involving the UV/Fe(III)–oxalate system was developed for the reduction of nitrate (NO3−) to harmless N-gaseous species, primarily nitrogen (N2), by carbon dioxide radical (·CO2−) generated in the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses confirmed the presence of both ·CO2− and ·OH radicals. Systematic investigations were conducted on various operational parameters, such as the initial Fe(III) concentration, oxalate concentration, and pH levels, to assess their impacts on the efficiency and products of NO3− reduction. Notably, solution pH played a significant role in influencing the NO3− reduction efficiency and the final products. At pH 2, approximately 75% of NO3− was converted into N2 with an 80% selectivity. In the pH range of 3 to 5, a remarkable NO3− removal rate of about 90% was achieved. Furthermore, higher concentrations of Fe(III) (2 mM) and oxalate (10 mM) were found to enhance NO3− removal to 91.95% and 88.71%, respectively. The presence of DO increased the oxidative potential in the reaction system, subsequently enhancing the selectivity conversion of NO3− to N2. In summary, the UV/Fe(III)–oxalate system exhibits significant potential for effective removal of NO3− while achieving high selectivity for the production of N2 in water remediation applications.

Despite global initiatives to address climate change, the year 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded in history. The need for technologies to lower carbon emissions and to remove already emitted greenhouse gases is immense. There have been massive efforts to electrochemically drive CO 2 conversion to value-added chemicals such as ethylene, ethanol, and acetone using renewable energy.( 1 ) Copper (Cu) is notable for its ability to form high-value C-C bond compounds; however, selectivity and activity challenges remain. Efforts to tackle these issues have focused on catalyst, system and micro-environment developments,( 2 , 3 ) and among the critical factors, temperature plays an important role. Of reports that study temperature effects on CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R), usually the entire system is controlled at the same temperature, including the working electrode, electrolyte, and reference electrode. Further, the range of accessible temperatures is usually limited to a range of 10 – 70°C due to the aqueous electrolyte freezing or evaporating.( 4 , 5 ) This study focuses on the development and demonstration of an electrochemical system for decoupling the temperatures of the CO 2 R cathode and the electrolyte. This allows independent optimization of thermodynamic, mass transport, and kinetic, to improve both activity and selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The temperatures are separately controlled from 0 – 140 °C for the working electrode, and from 0 – 70°C for the electrolyte. These temperature gradients result in clearly different activity/selectivity trends compared to when a single temperature controls the entire system. While maintaining electrolyte temperature and current density, a lower cathode temperature favored methane formation, whereas a higher cathode temperature favored CO formation. The Faradaic efficiency of ethylene was maintained at 20% despite the changes in the temperature of the cathode. Furthermore, reducing the working electrode temperature effectively restricted H 2 formation down to 15%. We attributed this selectivity and activity change to the control of adsorption and desorption energies, thermal and chemical processes of CO 2 conversion, and changopanoles in the CO 2 solubility in the electrolyte through density function theory and computational fluid dynamics simulations.( 6 , 7 ) The system and method developed in this study can be translated to understanding the effects of mass transport and kinetics in other emerging electrochemical conversions for accelerating clean energy generation and achieving global sustainability goals References K.

This work presents a novel framework for numerically simulating the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing carbon dioxide (CO2). The framework focuses on efficient solution strategies for the coupled system of fluid flow equations and thermodynamic constraints. A key contribution lies in proposing a new set of equations for phase equilibrium calculations which simplifies the traditional vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations for two-phase CO2 mixtures. The first major novelty resides in the reduction of the conventional four-equation VLE system to a single equation, enabling efficient solution using a non-linear solver. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a second novelty is introduced by deriving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) directly from the UV-Flash equation. This ODE can be integrated alongside the governing fluid flow equations, offering a computationally efficient approach for simulating depressurization processes.

China’s transportation sector plays a significant role in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollution. Previous studies have predominantly utilized scenario analysis to forecast emissions for the next 30 to 50 years based on coefficients from a base year. To elucidate the current state of gas emissions in the transportation sector, this study employed panel data for 10 types of gas emissions from 2001 to 2020, analyzing their emission characteristics, tendencies, and synergistic effects. Utilizing the Kaya equation and the logarithmic mean division index (LMDI) decomposition method, we developed a model of pollutant emissions that considers the synergistic effects, pollution emission intensity, energy mix, energy consumption intensity, and population. The results show that all pollutants in the transportation sector decreased except for NH3 and CO2. There was a synergistic effect between air pollutants and CO2 emissions, but the reduction was not significant. From 2013 to 2020, the transportation sector shifted from a high emission intensity with low synergy to a low emission intensity with high synergy. The results indicate that off-road mobile vehicles, on-road diesel vehicles, and motorcycles became the main source of emissions from transportation in certain provinces, and a key area requiring attention in policy development. Gasoline consumption was identified as the primary contributor to the significant increase in synergistic emission variability in the transportation sector. These results provide policymakers with practical ways to optimize emission reduction pathways.

The increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and plastic waste in marine environments demand immediate action to mitigate their effects. A promising solution lies in enhancing algal cultivation in marine environments, which not only absorbs CO2 and produces oxygen (O2) but also contributes to carbon sequestration. This study aims to develop biodegradable substrates for algae cultivation, facilitating their gradual degradation in marine environments and eventual deposition on the ocean floor, thereby addressing both plastic pollution and CO2 emissions. We selected various degradable polymers and incorporated differing proportions of algae residue powder (10%, 20%, and 30% by weight) into these substrates. The compositions were processed through extrusion and molded into test samples for hot compression molding. Characterization included assessments of mass loss, morphology, chemical composition, and mechanical strength under both dry conditions and after immersion in seawater for up to two months. The results indicate that the incorporation of algae residue significantly accelerates the degradation of the samples, particularly under extended exposure to seawater. Mass loss measurements indicated that samples with a 30 wt% algae addition experienced mass losses of up to 12% after two months of immersion. Mechanical strength tests demonstrated a reduction of up to 57% in strength due to the incorporation of algae, with seawater immersion further exacerbating this loss. These findings highlight the potential of biopolymer substrates infused with algae residue for effective carbon sequestration through enhanced algae cultivation.

Decarbonization of hard-to-abate industrial sectors, namely the extractive industries, has become an imperative, and thus, processes such as carbon capture and utilization (CCU) have been explored thoroughly and seem to be a promising solution. Carbon dioxide (CO2) catalytic hydrogenation employing green hydrogen (H2) to produce synthetic methanol (MeOH) aims to utilize industrial-captured carbon. A thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of a pilot scale methanol synthesis reactor was conducted by modeling the process using Aspen Plus V12 software. The methanol synthesis model consists mainly of a multi-tubular packed-bed reactor with a thermal oil heat recovery system, a product separator, and an internal recycle loop for optimal efficiency. The reactor has a 5 kg h−1 methanol production capacity, and its heat recovery system achieves an overall heat reduction of 64.1% and can retrieve 1.293 kWh per kg of methanol produced. The overall carbon conversion achieved is 80.6%. Valuable information concerning the design and profile of the reactor is provided in this study.

Mounting pressure on emissions strictly connected to aviation has led to the development of SAF or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, an efficient tool by which aircraft operations are expected to cut emissions of climate altering agents considerably. According to several estimates, CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions could be cut significantly, and the emission of sulfur compounds into the atmosphere could also be vastly reduced via SAF. Though this form of alternative fuel is still somehow challenged by costs, production availability and related concerns, it’s still expected to lead to considerable reductions in terms of aviation-related emissions over the course of forthcoming years. As of today, the attention is almost entirely focused on reduced emissions and how to make the implementation of SAF more efficient, but there’s a remarkable side effect of SAF’s replacement of conventional fossil fuels – namely, its characteristic carbon isotope fingerprint – which could be used to improve estimates and other models at least on local scales.

The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) using renewable energies is widely recognized as a promising approach to establishing a sustainable closed carbon cycle economy. To date, the focus of this field has primarily been on the electrolysis of ambient pressure CO 2 , where the critical factors include the limited solubility of CO 2 in many electrolytes and its hindered mass transport to the electrodes. However, industrial CO 2 is typically pressurized during capture, transport, and storage, often existing in dissolved form. Herein, we shift our focus to the potential applications of supercritical CO 2 (SCO 2 ) obtained from industrial storage. By using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations integrated with the slow-growth sampling (SG-AIMD) method, we conducted a systematic investigation into the supercritical CO 2 reduction reaction (SCO 2 RR) on various Cu surfaces. Our findings reveal that Cu(111) favors CO* generation, while Cu(100) promotes formic acid production under the reaction conditions of SCO 2 R. In the meantime, we present a comprehensive free energy diagram incorporating both kinetics and thermodynamics of SCO 2 and Cu atom migration, which illustrates the critical role of Cu sites with high coordination numbers induced by intermediate adsorption in the overall performance of CO 2 electroreduction into formic acid. This study would lay the foundation for potential applications of supercritical CO2 and the designing of effective catalysts in the future.

An attractive concept in the chemical manufacturing industry is the adoption of a circular carbon economy, which can include continuous capture and conversion of CO 2 into industrially relevant chemical feedstocks. This has driven considerable research interest in electrochemical CO 2 reduction. 1 Despite this popularity, major challenges remain even for the most advanced CO 2 reduction reactors, including low conversion rates and energy efficiencies; moreover, in many cases, multiple carbon-containing products are generated, which add to costs for downstream separation. 2 By contrast, thermochemical CO 2 hydrogenation is well established and typically demonstrates higher energy efficiency and selectivity compared to electrochemical CO 2 reduction. 3,4 This notable contrast drives our interest in better understanding the physics that governs differences in reactivity between thermocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactors. To address these questions, we are pursuing a unique approach that involves feeding humidified CO 2 and H 2 , respectively, to the cathode and anode of an electrochemical membrane-electrode assembly (MEA). This presentation will cover initial work we have undertaken to design and validate this reactor for the study CO 2 electro-reduction. The overall design of our reactor resembles a hydrogen fuel cell fed with humidified H 2 and CO 2 . Thus, it was initially benchmarked through operation as an electrochemical hydrogen pump, wherein humidified Ar was fed to the cathode and humidified H 2 was fed to the anode with Pt/C as the catalyst on each side of the membrane. Under these conditions, a cation exchange membrane (CEM) readily generated current densities in excess of 1 A/cm 2 with monotonic decreases in polarization with increased temperature at fixed current. We then undertook analogous hydrogen pumping experiments using anion exchange membranes (AEM) that had been ion-exchanged with hydroxide, carbonate, and bicarbonate anions. We observed net proton transport between the anode and cathode chambers in each case, albeit with higher ionic resistance for AEMs in the bicarbonate form. We then undertook further studies to demonstrate the ability to reduce CO 2 using H 2 fed to the anode. This operating mode eliminates the need for a liquid anode feed, which dramatically reduces the driving force for CO 2 crossover via bicarbonate formation. Moreover, the Pt/C anode catalyst is expected to oxidize hydrogen with minimal polarization, allowing the total cell polarization to be interpreted simply as the cathode potential on the RHE scale. CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out using commercial Cu/C catalyst with online gas chromatography and NMR for product analysis of volatile and condensable products, respectively. Operation with a CEM yielded only H 2 (g) at the cathode, but initial experiments with an AEM in the carbonate/bicarbonate form gave high selectivity to ethanol at 70 o C.

This study explores a novel solvent-based delamination method that employs a mixture of triethyl phosphate (TEP), acetone, and carbon dioxide (CO2) under pressure and temperature for the efficient and fast direct recycling of positive electrode production scraps. Optimization of experimental conditions led to achieve 100% of delamination within 15 min at 120 °C and 100 bar, with a low solvent consumption of 1.5 of TEP to electrode ratio (w/w). The CO2 allows decreasing the viscosity of the TEP and acetone mixture and so increasing its diffusivity; favoring the binder dissolution and accelerating the delamination process versus other reported processes. This original approach not only enables the reduction of solvent consumption (by 6.7×), but removes the need for stirring, which is often detrimental to solvent-based approaches for scaling up the process while maintaining 100% of delamination. Subsequent to the delamination process, the active material LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) in powder form was easily and fully separated from the current collector, enabling a comprehensive characterization. A more in-depth focus on the electrochemically active material revealed that its chemical composition, crystal structure, and microstructure remained preserved throughout the recycling process. Ultimately, the electrochemical performance of the recycled NMC622 closely resembled that of the pristine NMC622, affirming the promising potential of this approach.

Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, the Earth's atmosphere has experienced a gradual increase in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations, leading to the trapping of solar energy and consequent global warming. This shift in climate dynamics carries significant consequences, including heightened levels of secondary pollutants in urban areas and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. To address these pressing environmental challenges, there is a widespread global inclination toward adopting sustainable technologies and reducing CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions [1,2]. However, the primary source of CO 2 emissions remain the combustion of fossil fuels, which is expected to persist as the dominant energy source for the foreseeable future. It is driven by extensive usage across various sectors, notably in the chemical industry and transportation. Despite growing awareness of the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to viable alternatives in these sectors presents formidable challenges. Factors such as entrenched infrastructure, economic dependencies, and technological barriers complicate the shift away from fossil fuels, highlighting the complexity of the transition toward sustainable solutions [1,3]. The emergence of CO 2 electrolyzers, which can be powered by various energy sources including renewable options like solar power, can redefine the production of chemicals, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels in this sector and thereby mitigating CO 2 emissions. This shift offers a promising solution to address global warming problems. These devices facilitate the conversion of CO 2 into valuable chemicals through electrochemical processes, specifically the electrochemical CO 2 Reduction Reaction (CO 2 RR), thus aiding emission reduction and integrating renewable energy into global infrastructure. However, scaling this technology to industrial levels reveals significant hurdles. Achieving consistent reaction rates across the whole cell's surface area, optimizing current distribution, and addressing challenges related to CO 2 mass transfer are critical considerations. Among these challenges, maintaining electrochemical performance over time emerges as the most important factor. Industrial-scale implementation is further complicated by the inherent complexity of operational modes, expanded surface areas, and intricate flow paths. Consequently, adopting a model-based approach becomes paramount. Leveraging computational models allows for comprehensive analysis and optimization of large-scale CO 2 electrolysis systems, helping to understand system dynamics and to refine pivotal components such as gas diffusion electrodes. Advancing CO 2 electrolyzer technology holds significant importance for both academic research and industrial applications in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions [4,5]. In this study, we present a two-dimensional transient-state multiphase Gas Diffusion Electrode (GDE) model, which describes mass and heat transfer, electrochemical kinetics, aqueous-phase reactions, and species concentrations within the total flowing electrolyte volume in the system over time. Our study focuses on the conversion of CO 2 to formate due to its industrial significance and commercial viability. We provide experimental validation of the model using results obtained from an industrial cell, specifically the first industrial 1526 cm² electrochemical cell. This represents a significant advancement, with a 60-fold increase from the largest three-compartment electrolyzer reported to date [6]. Subsequently, we apply the model to predict the scalability of the GDE and assess the impact of key parameters on system performance. We observe that electrolyzers with greater heights exhibit significantly stronger reactions at the same current density. Moreover, the model effectively captures the pH time dependency at various points in the GDE and aids in identifying the stability and evolution of the chemical species composing the GDE. It also accurately represents variations in carbonate and bicarbonate production, as well as the decrease of hydroxide over time in the catholyte. Furthermore, in the context of stability, we numerically investigate the impact of catalyst degradation over time on system performance. [1] Konderla, Vojtěch.

Carbon dioxide is emitted in several industrial processes and contributes to global warming. One of the industries that is considered a significant emitter is metallurgy. Therefore, it is necessary to search for and implement methods to reduce its emissions from metallurgical processes. An alternative option to the use of conventional coke, which is produced solely from fossil coal, is the utilization of bio-coke. The production of bio-coke involves the use of coking coal and the incorporation of biomass-derived substances such as biochar (charcoal). The article presents the results of the research on the influence of the biochar addition on the structural, textural, and technological properties of produced bio-coke. Research on the production and analysis of the properties of the obtained bio-coke aimed at assessing the potential possibilities of applying it in the process of a carbothermal reduction of manganese ore in order to smelt ferroalloys. Studies have shown that biochar addition to the coking blend in an amount of up to 20% allows a bio-coke characterized by properties enabling the mentioned use to be obtained. Bio-coke was characterized by higher CO2 reactivity index (CRI), lower post-reaction strength (CSR), and higher reactivity to synthetic manganese ore than regular metallurgical coke. In the context of industrial applications of bio-coke, it is necessary to verify its production and use on a pilot and industrial scale.

Summary Fluid chemistry in the vadose zone absent of organic life is governed by the interactions between rock mineral surfaces, water, and atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO2] since carbon and its aquatic species control the system pH. Even though the effects of high carbon concentrations in the pore fluids of rocks and soils can be controlled ex-situ, their non-invasive monitoring and control still face difficulty, due to the inaccessibility of pore spaces. We propose monitoring the effect of carbon-rich solutions via their influence on the electrical relaxation behaviour, using the spectral induced polarisation (SIP) method. Generally, the SIP response is determined by the rock’s texture and the chemical composition of the electrical double layer (EDL) forming at the mineral-water interface. The understanding of how the relaxation behaviour of rocks and soils is controlled by pore water salinity and pH and how fast the EDL adapts to changes in pore fluid chemistry, however, is still limited. In this study, we conducted a series of controlled experiments where the diffusion of sodium hydrogencarbonate solution into quartz-rich sandstones was monitored with SIP at high temporal resolution. To identify the underlying relaxation processes, we analyzed the obtained complex conductivity spectra by performing a Debye decomposition, yielding the system’s relaxation-time distribution. Our results show that increasing pH leads to increased imaginary conductivities and systematic shifts in the peak relaxation time of the system. The observed temporal dynamics of the peak relaxation time can be described with a diffusion-type equation. We find that the dynamics are not governed by the permeability or porosity of the rock. In one experiment, salinities high enough to diminish the polarization of the system were reached. This reduction in polarization at peak frequency cannot be explained through simple Stern layer polarization models alone, suggesting that diffusive layer polarization plays an important role with increasing pH. While polarization magnitude reduces significantly, peak spectral position shifts towards larger relaxation times suggesting a reduction in the mobilities of the surface ions. Due to the increased salinity, the double layer thickness decreases, in turn decreasing the relaxation length scale, and lowering the diffuse layers screening effect. This study shows that the SIP method can capture the dynamic changes at the mineral-water interfaces in rocks in response to changing pH over a broad range of salinities, making SIP a promising method for the monitoring of subsurface processes associated with changes in the inorganic carbon concentration of the pore fluid.

Along with mitigation, the effective utilization of waste CO and CO 2 from point sources in combination with renewable electrons has the potential to address climate challenges and change the manufacturing paradigm. Numerous funding offices and governments have set device level goals and reduction targets for CO 2 emissions putting momentum behind and a focus on electrochemical CO/CO 2 reduction. To enable this vision, the identification of limiting phenomena,[1] scalable integration and fabrication methods, and corresponding critical breakthroughs to improve stability (constant operation) and/or durability (dynamic operation), combined with selective and energy efficient operation are necessary. The implementation of gas diffusion electrodes over the last several years has enabled higher current densities and lower cell voltages for electrochemical CO/CO 2 reduction.[2,3] Here, we pull from our experience in the fuel cell space,[4] aiming to serve as a node for the development of cell and electrode architectures that would help the community integrate novel materials (electrocatalysts, membranes, and ionomers) and test devices at scales commensurate with the standards in the fuel cell and electrolysis community (>25 cm 2 ). To this end, we will present limiting phenomena for CO 2 to formate, CO 2 to CO, and CO to various products, focusing on the effects of cathode composition, ionomer binder chemistry[5] and content, electrode fabrication processes[6], device configuration[7], and reactant concentrations.

The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) using renewable electricity sources could provide a sustainable solution for generating valuable chemicals, such as formate salt or formic acid. However, an efficient, stable, and scalable electrode generating formate at industrially viable current densities (>100 mA cm–2) is yet to be developed. Sn or In-based catalysts in gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) can efficiently produce formate. However, their long-term durability is limited owing to catalyst deactivation, carbonate deposition, and electrode flooding. Herein, a systematic study of 20 cm2 GDEs with SnO2 and In2O3 catalyst layers is presented in conjunction with various electrode operation strategies (i.e., flow-by vs flow through, dry vs humidified CO2, continuous vs reverse polarity pulse electrolysis). It is demonstrated that the incorporation of CeO2 nanoparticles as a promoter in either SnO2 or In2O3 catalyst layers coupled with intermittent reverse polarity pulse operation dramatically improves the GDE stability during 12 h of tests at 500 mA cm–2 with over 90% formate Faradaic efficiency. Due to its strong oxidizing capacity, CeO2 helps Sn and In regain their valence state of + IV and + III, respectively, which are in situ reduced during CO2RR, as shown by the surface characterization of the electrodes. The effect of the initial particle size of SnO2 and reverse polarity pulse on the catalytic activity, durability, and carbonate salt precipitation in the GDE have also been addressed. Regarding two-phase flow dynamics, the quasi-convective gas flow through the GDE was more beneficial than the gas flow-by mode for enabling stable operation at high current densities (up to 500 mA cm–2). The synergistic approach of catalyst layer engineering coupled with diverse GDE operation modes explored here is promising for the scale-up of efficient and durable reactors for the CO2RR to formate and CO2 redox flow batteries.

Electrocatalysts for several reactions and processes are actively developed and under development by multiple research groups around the globe. These materials include catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction [1], carbon dioxide reduction [2], hydrogen oxidation [3], oxygen evolution [4] and many other classes. While there is a significant interest to these materials both from scientific and industrial point of view a serious question of their scalability and manufacturability had arisen. In this work aspects of materials scale-up through careful design of reactors, mixing conditions, reaction conditions monitoring and CFD modelling will be reported. A case study on the model system of unsupported silver nanoparticles will be discussed. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized on scale with variation of reagents concentration, different types of impellers and RPM. Materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and BET and the data were correlated to the scaleup variables. A CFD model was developed to model nanoparticles formation and was used to guid experimental scaleup effort. Acknowledgements and Statements.

To drive the further development of electrochemical CO 2 reduction technologies, there is an urgent need for highly active catalysts that minimize unwanted side reactions and that also possess a large specific surface area. While nanostructured catalysts typically fulfill the latter requirement, they often use porous carbon supports that improve the nanoparticles’ dispersion but can shift the product selectivity towards undesirable H 2 formation. [1] This challenge could be solved by using unsupported aerogels consisting of interconnected nanodomain networks of highly porous materials such as nano-wires or -particles, which provide a large surface area while minimizing unwanted side reactions. [2] So far, precious metals such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag) have shown remarkable activity and selectivity as CO 2 -reduction catalysts for CO production. [3] However, due to the high cost of such noble metals, improving their mass-specific activity is essential. One strategy to attain this, especially for Au, is to reduce the adsorption energy of the catalyst’s surface towards CO by changing the electronic structure of the d-band through alloying with other metals. In this context, ordered AuCu structures have proven to be promising candidates for improving the CO 2 -to-CO activity and selectivity. [4] With the motivation to combine both of the above approaches (i.e., Au-alloying with Cu and the absence of a C-support), in this study we present an AuCu aerogel with an average domain size of ≈ 7 nm that exhibits an exceptionally high faradaic efficiency of 87 % for CO at -0.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This corresponds to a ≈ 2-fold higher Au-mass-specific partial current density for CO when compared to an equivalent, monometallic Au aerogel. Notably, this enhanced activity and selectivity are achieved by performing a potential cycling procedure prior to the CO 2 reduction potential hold that involves cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 0.1 and 1.7 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV/s until a stable voltammogram is achieved. To investigate the changes in the electronic and structural properties which have happened to the catalyst during this potential cycling, we performed an in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements in the course of these CVs. Chiefly, these spectroelectrochemcial tests were carried out in the same cell used for the assessment of the CO 2 reduction performance, ensuring for the first time that the mass-transport conditions encountered by the catalyst during these XAS measurements are identical to those in the CO 2 -reduction activity and selectivity tests. Figure 1 illustrates the changes observed throughout the potential cycling procedure in the Cu K- and Au L3-absorption edges, whereby the acquired spectra were submitted to a multivariate curve resolution (MCR) analysis. For the Cu K spectra, a total of three components were identified to describe the whole dataset, and it becomes evident that as the number of cycles increases, the copper oxide phase (component 1 in Figs. 1b and 1c) diminishes while a metallic phase (component 2, identified as an AuCu alloy through EXAFS fitting) becomes more prominent. In the case of the Au L3 data, only two components were discerned to describe the dataset, and both of them were identified as distinct AuCu alloy phases through EXAFS fitting. With an increasing number of cycles, component 2 (featuring a higher oxide content than component 1) becomes dominant at positive potentials, suggesting an increasing Au content on the aerogel’s surface as the potential cycling procedure progresses. In summary, in this contribution we present an AuCu aerogel catalyst exhibiting a high activity and selectivity for CO production that is achieved by cyclic voltammetry treatment prior to holding CO 2 reduction potential. The results derived from the in situ XAS measurements on this material indicate that this process effectively removes the copper oxide domains initially present in the catalyst, forming a novel AuCu alloy phase while simultaneously enriching the aerogel’s surface with Au.

Problems. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia's refusal to accept the planned volumes of natural gas to the countries of the European Union caused a global energy and financial crisis, and changed the movement towards the development of renewable energy. the transition to sustainable and clean energy sources has become problematic for many countries. Objective. General review and analytical analysis of trends in the development of energy consumption and the introduction of renewable sources in electric power systems in 2017-2023 using the results of research International Energy Agency (IEA), listed in World Energy Outlook (WEO) [1-6]. Methodology of implementation Trends in the development of the world system of renewable power plants to ensure climate neutrality, zero emissions, and a clean ecological environment have been analyzed for the study of the topic article. The study of changes and ways to limit the negative consequences of hostilities in Europe and the Middle East was carried out according to the long-term plans of the IEA. Results. An overview of changes in the structure of energy resources in the world energy balance is presented. It is shown that the energy crisis has led to a sharp increase in the production of fossil fuels, primarily coal and oil. The construction of new capacities for the production of 250 billion tons of liquefied gas has begun. in order to stabilize fuel prices and reduce the price of electricity. Statistical and forecast information on the structure of the world energy balance and annual electricity production by types of generation is provided. The environmental negative consequences registered for the last three years are considered: increased CO2 emissions; air pollution with fine dust; pollution of soils and water horizons; changes in climatic indicators. The problems that have arisen for the implementation of new projects for the construction of renewable sources, the development of electric power infrastructure, security and reliability of power supply are analyzed. An analysis of the proposed measures under several scenarios to increase the production and use of solar, wind and nuclear energy, reduce dependence on traditional energy sources and the prospect of zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 is carried out. Conclusions. Actions aimed at reducing energy consumption, projected reduction in fuel prices, planned restarts of nuclear power and further implementation of renewable power plants – these are the proposed measures that make it possible to solve the problems that have arisen around the world. Confidence in meeting the tasks is confirmed by 83 countries and the European Union to meet their commitments to achieve zero carbon dioxide emissions on time and in full. Learning from the experience and directions of development of the world energy sector will create an opportunity for the rapid restoration of the energy structure in Ukraine in the post-war period.

Combining spectroscopy with electrochemistry enables the monitoring of changes in bonding, molecular orientation, and chemical composition during electrochemical processes at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) allows a direct in situ monitoring of electrochemical processes occurring at the electrode interface due plasmonic enhancement by surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). 1 Electrochemical ATR-SEIRAS has been used extensively for investigating electrocatalysis 2,3 , characterizing adsorbed species 4 , and detecting reaction intermediates 5 . However, SEIRAS literature has focused on plasmonic metals while the small number of SEIRAS studies reported on graphene surfaces are incompatible with electrochemical experimentation or not considered. Nonetheless, carbon electrodes are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis, sensing, and energy storage 6 , thus probing their surface chemistries are of particular interest. Thus, there is still a need for a convenient substrate for probing graphitic interfaces using electrochemical SEIRAS. In our first study 1 , we expanded the scope of SEIRAS by introducing a robust hybrid graphene on gold (graphene-gold) substrate where we monitored electrografting processes occurring on the graphene/electrolyte interface. The graphene-gold substrate successfully monitored the electrografting of 2,2,6,6-tetremethyl-1-pipperridine N-oxyl (4-amino-TEMPO) and 4-nitrobenzene diazonium (4-NBD) in real-time using SEIRAS and cyclic voltammetry. The graphene-gold substrate is proficient at resolving the spectral responses of the electrografting and redox transformations of the grafted moieties occurring at the graphene interface spectroscopically and electrochemically. We clearly demonstrate highly sensitive SEIRAS in real-time at a graphene interface. This substrate opens a plethora of possibilities for real-time electrochemical ATR-SEIRAS investigations on graphitic interfaces such as catalysis, battery research, and CO 2 capture and conversion, the latter of which our laboratory is exploring using modified electrodes. Electrochemical carbon capture and concentration (eCCC) methods have emerged as a prosing alternative to the current state-of-the-art temperature-pressure swing systems. 7 Redox-active organic (RAO) molecules such as quinones have been reported to reversibly capture and release CO 2. 7 However, they suffer from low solubility in solution. New approaches have explored immobilizing these molecules on electrode interfaces for increased CO 2 adsorption capacities. 11 Our graphene-gold allows a unique opportunity for an in situ mechanistic investigation of the immobilization and carbonization of RAOs. Our current work investigating immobilized aminoanthraquinone and a riboflavin derivative will be presented.

Our research interests aim at establishing structure/property relations leading to rational designs of functionalized materials for efficient electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy conversion and storage. There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To optimize the hydrogenation-type electrocatalytic approach, we have proposed to utilize nanostructured metallic centers (e.g. Pd, Pt or Ru) in a form of highly dispersed and reactive nanoparticles generated within supramolecular network of distinct nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen-coordination complexes. Among important issues are the mutual completion between hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction and specific interactions between coordinating centers and metallic sites. We have also explored the ability of biofilms to form hydro-gel-type aggregates of microorganisms attached to various surfaces including those of carbon electrode materials. Upon incorporation of various noble metal nanostructures and/or conducting polymer ultra-thin films, highly reactive and selective systems toward CO 2 -reduction have been obtained. Another possibility to enhance electroreduction of carbon dioxide is to explore direct transformation of solar energy to chemical energy using transition metal oxide semiconductor materials. We show here that, by intentional and controlled combination of metal oxide semiconductors (titanium (IV) oxide and copper (I) oxide), we have been able to drive effectively photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide mostly to methanol. Application of metal oxides as active matrices in electrocatalysis is particular importance. The hydrous behavior, which favors proton mobility and affects overall reactivity, reflects not only the oxide’s chemical properties but its texture and morphology as well. For example, the mixed WO 3 /ZrO 2 systems are characterized by fast charge (electron, proton) propagation during the system’s redox transitions. By dispersing metallic Cu electrocatalytic nanoparticles over such active WO 3 /ZrO 2 supports, the electrocatalytic activities of the respective systems toward the reduction of carbon dioxide have been enhanced even at decreased loadings in acid media. The fact that WO 3 /ZrO 2 nanostructures are in immediate contact with the metallic catalytic sites leads to the specific interactions (via the surface hydroxyl groups) with the reaction intermediates (e.g. CO adsorbates). Formation of ammonia is one of the most important chemical synthetic processes. Under industrial conditions, ammonia is primarily been synthesized from nitrogen and hydrogen via the Haber-Bosch process which requires pressurizing and heating, despite utilization of catalysts. Consequently, development of low-temperature synthetic methodology is tempting both from the practical and fundamental reasons. An ultimate goal for electrochemistry is to generate NH 3 from N 2 at temperatures lower than 100ºC, atmospheric pressure, and with use of new generation of catalysts. Currently, most of electrochemical approaches to drive N 2 -fixation suffer from slow kinetics due to the difficulty of achieving the appropriate adsorption and activation of dinitrogen molecule leading to cleavage of the strong triple N≡N bond. Our recent studies, clearly demonstrate that coordinatively stabilized iron catalytic sites, e.g. iron-centered heme-type porphyrins or iron phosphide, FeP and Fe 2 P phases, have been found to act as efficient catalysts for the formation of NH 3 in alkaline and semi-neutral media.

In order to close the carbon cycle, the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reaction (CO2RR) using copper as a electrochemical catalyst is gaining much more attention. When considering the social implementation of the technology, the gaseous CO 2 used for the CO2RR should be collected from the atmosphere. However, the gas inevitably contains a number of impurities such as oxygen, NO x and SO x . Among them, the possibility of oxygen contamination is high, and the reactivity of oxygen is higher than that of CO 2 . Therefore, the oxygen would affect the reaction selectivity of CO2RR. To demonstrate the effect of oxygen on the CO2RR, oxygen-contaminated CO 2 gas was used as the feed gas for the system in previous reports. 1,2 For the positive effect of oxygen, the twenty percent of oxygen in the CO 2 gas decreased the overpotential for the CO2RR, thus increasing the reactivity of the reaction. On the other hand, for the negative effect of oxygen, the selectivity for CO2RR was largely decreased with only four percent of oxygen in the gas under high pressure conditions. The discrepancies in the reported results are due to various factors at different scales, such as current density, type of electrode, concentrations of reactants, surface pH, surface orientation of the catalyst, and oxidation number of the surface metal atoms. Among these factors, those related to the surface reactivity of the catalyst have the greatest effect on the reactivity and selectivity for CO2RR. The presence of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, such as O* and OH*, has been demonstrated during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) using Raman spectroscopy. 1 In the present work, 3 we perform first-principles calculations for the CO2RR in the presence of oxygen species (O* or OH*) on the Cu(100) surface to focus on the effect of the adsorption of ORR intermediates (Figure 1a) while excluding macroscale differences, such as surface pH, local concentration of reactants, and other factors. In the results of the calculation, we identified the most stable structure of the Cu(100) surface on which zero to five of one kind of oxygen reduction intermediates were adsorbed. Using the obtained surface, the activation energy for CHO* formation by CO hydrogenation was calculated. In the results, the activation energy was 0.74 eV on the clean Cu(100) surface, increased on the OH*/Cu(100) surface (Figure 1b), and decreased to a maximum of 0.15 eV on the O*/Cu(100) surface (Figure 1c). This is because the initial state of CO hydrogenation was activated by the oxygen atoms adsorbed onto the Cu(100) surface. References (1) He, M.; Li, C.; Zhang, H.; Chang, X.; Chen, J.

There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change, and its conversion into useful carbon-based fuels or chemicals. Numerous homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been proposed to induce the CO 2 reduction and, depending on the reaction conditions various products that include carbon monoxide, oxalate, formate, carboxylic acids, formaldehyde, acetone or methanol, in addition to various hydrocarbons at different ratios. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To produce highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts, the transition-metal-based molecular materials are often considered. It is believed that, during electroreduction, the rate limiting step is the protonation of the adsorbed CO product to form the CHO adsorbate. Because reduction of CO 2 can effectively occur by hydrogenation, to optimize the conventional copper-based electrocatalytic approach, we explore such a model catalytic matrix as nanostructured tungsten oxide nanowires which are capable to undergo partial reduction to hydrogen-rich nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide bronzes. We demonstrate here that following the ntercalation of copper into tungsten(VI)-oxide-nanowires, the resulting electrocatalytic systems exhibits synergistic properties toward electroreduction of carbon dioxide, in addition to other inert inorganic reactants, such as oxygen, nitrates(V), nitrates(III) or bromates(V). In particular, evidence has been provided that hierarchically deposited films (on glassy carbon) of copper(I) oxide decorated with tungsten(VI) oxide nanowires and, subsequently, subjected to electroreduction and voltammetric conditioning to generate hybrid Cu/WO 3 catalyst can be successfully utilized to drive reduction of carbon dioxide (saturated solution, concentration, ca. 0.033 mol dm -3 )in a fairly strong acid medium of 0.5 mol dm -3 H 2 SO 4 . Here formation of the partially reduced tungsten oxides (H x WO 3 and WO 3-y ) is accompanied by consumption of protons and sorption of hydrogen, and it tends to inhibit hydrogen evolution by shifting the proton discharge toward more negative potentials. Our observations are consistent with the view that copper is irreversibly trapped (i.e., it cannot be reoxidized) within the network of WO 3 nanowires. The dispersed metallic copper sites seem to facilitate electron transfers and charge distribution in the catalytic layers. Among important issues are the capacity of copper-containing partially reduced tungsten oxides to induce reductions of nitrates, bromates and oxygen in acid medium. On mechanistic grounds, the existence of hydrogen-rich partially-reduced tungsten oxides, H x WO 3 , which contain large population of delocalized electrons and monoatomic H, or coexisting protons and electrons, H + + e - , is likely to induce hydrogenation of carbon oxo species, followed by protonation, in the vicinity of Cu to form oxo-hydrocarbon-type products. The hybrid Cu/WO 3 system, is also characterized by improved durability, relative to pristine Cu 2 O-dervied copper, as evident from electroreductions under chronoamperometric conditions. Our research aiming at optimization the material’s activity and selectivity have also concentrated on application of mixed oxides, e.g. WO 3 -ZrO 2 . Finally, the present study demonstrates the usefulness of certain diagnostic electroanalytical approaches, such as ultramicroelectrode-based sensing,chronocoulometric probing of the diffusional-type charge propagation dynamics , or voltammetric stripping and monitoring of small organic or inorganic molecules as electroreduction products.

Abstract We performed a retrospective cohort analysis comparing trends in low global warming potential (GWP) inhaler prescribing in primary care in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland between 2018 and 2024 using national prescribing data. There was little change in England, a reduction from 36.6–31.0% in Scotland, a reduction from 36.7–33.2% in Northern Ireland, and an increase from 30.8–41.1% in Wales. Only in Wales was there a simultaneous reduction in high GWP inhalers and an increase in low GWP inhalers. Over the time period of the study there has been a saving of 20,303 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in Wales

As the global community intensifies efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, active carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is being planned alongside emission reductions. The open ocean, which already absorbs a substantial portion of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, is increasingly seen as a promising site for various types of marine CDR (mCDR). All of these approaches are in the preliminary stages of development, and many questions remain with regard to their assessment and governance. This paper discusses the potential role of the newly established Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement) in assessing and governing mCDR. A step-by-step mapping of the various stages of the BBNJ environmental impact assessment process shows that the new Clearing House Mechanism (CHM) could facilitate knowledge pluralism and contribute to the holistic assessment of mCDR proposals. The paper concludes by identifying challenges in operationalizing the CHM and putting forward recommendations to strengthen its capacity for fostering knowledge pluralism in decision-making on mCDR research and implementation.

Background Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects a significant portion of the female population, negatively impacting quality of life. New therapeutic approaches, such as the combination of laser therapy and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), are being explored as potential treatments to enhance sexual function in affected women. Methods This original study involved 23 women aged 37 to 72, all diagnosed with varying degrees of FSD (mild, moderate, severe). The participants underwent a pre-treatment evaluation using a custom-designed Likert scale (Female Sexual Health Questionnaire) designed by the authors to evaluate the symptoms of the patients. The treatment involved a single session combining hybrid carbon dioxide 10600 nm and 1540 nm laser therapy with PRP applied to the genital area. One month post-treatment, participants were reassessed using the same questionnaire. Results Of the 23 patients studied, 65.2% (15 patients) exhibited hypoactive sexual desire, and 73.33% of them (11 out of 15) demonstrated improvement post-treatment (P = 0.00048). Overall sexual satisfaction increased by 28.2% (P = 0.0032), and lubrication improved in 54.5% of patients (P = 0.0027). Significant reductions in dyspareunia were observed, with 80% of patients experiencing pain relief (P = 0.0035). Patients with moderate dysfunction showed the highest response, with 100% (6 out of 6) demonstrating improvement across domains (P = 0.0009). Postmenopausal women experienced a 30.9% improvement in sexual function (P = 0.007), while premenopausal women exhibited a 7.5% improvement (P = 0.04). Statistically significant changes were also noted in the frequency of orgasm (P = 0.0058) and genital sensitivity in patients with moderate dysfunction. Conclusion Our data indicated significant improvements in FSD, particularly in moderate to severe dysfunction, with positive changes in key aspects of sexual function such as lubrication, desire, and ease of orgasm. However, the limited number of participants and short follow-up in this pilot study highlight the need for further investigation into hybrid CO2/1540 nm laser therapy combined with PRP as a therapeutic option for female sexual dysfunction.

National carbon peak track and optimized provincial carbon allocations are crucial for mitigating regional inequality within the commercial building sector during China's transition to carbon neutrality. This study proposes a top-down model to evaluate carbon trajectories in operational commercial buildings up to 2060. Through Monte Carlo simulation, scenario analysis is conducted to assess carbon peak values and the corresponding peaking year, thereby optimizing carbon allocation schemes both nationwide and provincially. The results reveal that (1) the nationwide carbon peak for commercial building operations is projected to reach 890 (+- 50) megatons of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) by 2028 (+- 3.7 years) in the case of the business-as-usual scenario, with a 7.87% probability of achieving the carbon peak under the decarbonization scenario. (2) Significant disparities will exist among provinces, with Shandong's carbon peak projected at 69.6 (+- 4.0) MtCO2 by 2029, approximately 11 times higher than Ningxia's peak of 6.0 (+- 0.3) MtCO2 by 2027. (3) Guided by the principle of maximizing the emission reduction potential, the optimal provincial allocation scheme reveals the top three provinces requiring the most significant reductions in the commercial sector: Xinjiang (5.6 MtCO2), Shandong (4.8 MtCO2), and Henan (4.7 MtCO2). Overall, this study offers optimized provincial carbon allocation strategies within the commercial building sector in China via dynamic scenario simulations, with the goal of hitting the carbon peak target and progressing toward a low-carbon future for the building sector.

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction is one of the most promising processes for a sustainable closure of the artificial carbon cycle. A severe limitation for wide-scale industrial applicability has been the absence of an efficient and selective electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO 2 to higher-reduced valuable chemicals and fuels. Cu is the only catalyst found to produce considerable amount of multicarbon products, albeit at high overpotentials. The mechanism of the conversion process is unclear, with different active sites and rate-determining steps being proposed. In addition, the mass transport of CO 2 has been suggested to have a significant impact on the product selectivity 1,2 . Gas-diffusion-layer(GDL)-based electrolyzers have become a state-of-the-art solution to provide a high concentration of CO 2 to the active sites to circumvent these mass transport limitations. In this work, we present a new multi-scale model based on first-principles kinetics 3 , and a modification of a recently reported gas diffusion electrode model 4 . We use this to generate a digital twin of experimental electrode systems and show that even in GDL systems, mass transport is the limiting factor governing all experimentally observed trends in product selectivity, irrespective of reaction mechanism or product pathway. We further find indications of C 2 products being predominantly formed in wider, accessible pores, while C 1 products are generated in deeper and thinner pores with less access to CO 2 . This work provides strong evidence for the importance of mass transport in designing CO 2 electrolyzers. References: Watkins, N. B. et al.

This project focuses on the development and implementation of a Carbon Footprint App designed to empower individuals and organizations to track and reduce their carbon emissions. By providing real-time tracking, personalized recommendations, and engaging features such as gamification and community challenges, the app aims to foster sustainable practices and raise awareness about the environmental impact of everyday activities. The methodology involves collecting user data on energy use, transportation, food consumption, and waste management, converting this data into carbon dioxide equivalents, and offering actionable advice to lower emissions.

Abstract Porous silica–ruthenium oxide composite catalysts were prepared with sol–gel‐based method using a cationic surfactant, cethyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), as templates to form well‐ordered nanopores in the catalyst particles. The previously reported heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into formic acid generally worked as metallic state, while the catalyst in the present study worked without reduction procedure for the catalyst activation to obtain the metallic states of the active ruthenium species. The textural properties of the catalysts in this work were affected by various pretreatment procedures, and washing and calcination pretreatments were identified as effective procedures to remove the surfactant micelle templates with 2–4 times higher specific surface area and pore volumes. The catalytic activity also improved with the pretreatments, and the catalyst with washing followed by calcination showed nearly three times higher activity than the catalyst without any pretreatments. The crystalline size of the active ruthenium species and the catalytic performance of porous silica–ruthenium oxide composite catalyst was influenced by amount of TEOS, the catalyst including small RuO 2 crystalline phase was obtained with high amount of TEOS and exhibited high activity for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into formic acid with comparative TON to previously reported metallic ruthenium‐based catalysts.

As the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly visible, carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) is gaining popularity to convert waste carbon dioxide to value-added products. As carbon monoxide (CO) is a key intermediate for valuable products such as methane and ethylene, CORR is studied to bypass CO 2 activation. Most of the work on CO2RR and CORR has focused on using water as a proton source as water’s hydrogen bonding supports key intermediates and acts as a proton source for hydrogenated products. Using nonaqueous solvents instead of water decreases the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water breakdown. Additionally mixed aqueous-nonaqueous systems allow for fundamental understanding of water’s role in electrochemical transformations when it is only available in limited quantities as a proton source. Here, we experimentally control water speciation and activity using aprotic solvent media during CORR. Remarkably, we show that aprotic solvents that support microheterogeneous water-water clusters leads to significant amounts of CORR products (methane and ethylene) with a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 22% in acetonitrile (χ H2O = 0.2); the first report of CORR to C2+ products using water in an aprotic solvent. In contrast, microhomogeneous systems – where water integrates into the solvents’ intermolecular binding network at all length scales and has lower water activity – primarily support undesired HER. Insights gained expand our understanding of water activity and nonaqueous electrolyte design for other important transformations reactions beyond CO reduction such as CO2RR and HER.

Abstract The machine learning methods are hereby proposed to predict the amount of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) emissions in a gasification process, which is one of the most important enabling technologies for carbon-containing materials, such as coal, biomass, and waste toward producing end products of worth, such as syngas, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels. In an attempt to support efforts for improving the emission prediction-a key criterion for enhancing efficiency and further, the environmental performance of gasification-two new advanced algorithms are being applied for the optimization of the model of a random forest: the Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO) and Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA). The tuned RFJS (RF+JSO) was the best of these configurations, providing the least RMSE of 0.593 on test data and the highest R 2 on validation of 0.983, proving to be most effective for the prediction of emissions. This goes to attest that the model RFJS would be a strong tool in real-time-based carbon emissions reduction due to its effectiveness in dealing with major implications from environmental monitoring to regulation and further into sustainable energy production.

The urgent need to tackle climate change drives the research on new technologies to help the transition of energy systems. Hydrogen is under significant consideration by many countries as a means to reach zero-carbon goals. Turkey has also started to develop hydrogen projects. In this study, the role of hydrogen in Turkey’s energy system is assessed through energy modeling using the cost optimization analytical tool, Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS). The potential effects of hydrogen blending into the natural gas network in the Turkish energy system have been displayed by scenario development. The hydrogen is produced via electrolysis using renewable electricity. As a result, by using hydrogen, a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions was observed; however, the accumulated capital investment value increased. Furthermore, it was shown that hydrogen has the potential to reduce Turkey’s energy import dependency by decreasing natural gas demand.

Because of the climate crisis caused by increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration, developing technologies for reducing them has become imperative. Among various tries, electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECRR) is one of the promising solutions for carbon dioxide recycling as it can be used for the production of more valuable industrial chemicals(e.g. syngas, CO, formic acid...) in a clean way. Ethylene, one of the products, has a high market price of 1.30 dollars/kg. It has various uses for polyethylene production and ethylbenzene synthesis. Ethanol is 1.00 dollars/kg and can be used as fuel. In addition, formic acid has a high value of 0.74 dollars/kg and is used in preservatives and anti-bacterial agents. Carbon monoxide can be easily converted into other hydrocarbon forms through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis For electrolysis, gas diffusion layer(GDL) based electrolyzers have been used. This is because carbon dioxide has a solubility limit of 33 mM, so humidified carbon dioxide in the form of a gas is used to overcome this up to 41 mM. The hybrid flow cell is an electrolytic bath in which a gas diffusion layer and a cathode liquid layer are separated from the anode by a polymer membrane. It is easy to collect liquid products generated from the cathode side, but it has resistance by the liquid layer. The MEA electrolyzer is an AEMWE-based electrolytic bath in which the cathode liquid layer has been removed. Since the electrode and the membrane are in direct contact and contain a small amount of liquid, a three-phase interface is formed, resulting in an electrolytic reaction. Focusing on the catalyst, Cu is the only mono-metal that shows decent selectivity for multi-carbon products(e.g. ethylene, ethanol, acetate, propanol...). For decades, various researches have been conducted on the development of Cu catalysts through bi-metal composition, oxidation state control and about grain boundaries, crystal facet, single-atom. However, it still has challenges about low partial current density and insufficient stability to commercialize. Herein, copper sulfide catalysts were fabricated on gas diffusible carbon paper with microporous layer(MPL/CP). First, Cu nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited on the MPL/CP. Subsequent immersing it into Na 2 S solution enables ionic exchange of surface oxygens with S ions. Because the copper sulfide state has low solubility product constant, so is thermodynamically more stable. As reported, sulfur can change the distance between metal molecules, their oxidation state and their morphologies. By adjusting the exchange condition, the catalyst morphology and surface composition can be easily controlled. The fabricated electrodes were employed as cathodes for CO 2 RR electrolyzer and its faradaic efficiency(FE) was computed. It was revealed that the CO 2 RR performance was highly affected by S coverage on Cu surface. At some point the existence of Sulfur changed selectivity by enhancing the FE of ethylene and oppressing FE of methane.

CCUS (Carbon dioxide Capture, Utilization and Storage), is attracting attention as an effective method for reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions toward carbon neutrality by 2050. Currently, chemical absorption followed by thermal desorption using liquid amine is employed as the CO 2 capture and concentration technology. However, low energy efficiency and high cost of the thermal swing process remain to be addressed. CO 2 capture driven by renewable electricity represents a promising alternative approach to mitigate CO 2 emissions and address climate change. Electrochemically mediated carbon capture can be achieved by developing redox-active CO 2 adsorbents, such as quinones. In aprotic electrolytes, reduced quinone species can selectively uptake CO 2 from a dilute feed upon electro-reduction via a nucleophilic addition reaction and release a concentrated CO 2 upon electrochemical oxidation. However, the low solubility of quinones in nonaqueous solvents limits their total CO 2 carrying capacity in the system. We synthesized a salt of imidazolium modified anthraquinone with ionic liquid-like structure to address the solubility issue. The synthesized cationic quinone derivatives showed more than 100 times higher solubility and high ionic conductivity as well as electrochemically reversible CO 2 adsorption-desorption. In addition, we synthesized anionic quinone derivatives, anthraquinone with sulfonate (SO 3 − ) moiety, by one-step salt metathesis reaction, and confirmed that the negatively charged quinones is also applicable to the electrochemical CO 2 capture. We report the electrochemical CO 2 capture-release behaviors of the ionic quinones and its monitoring using in situ spectroscopic analysis with the aid of density functional theory calculations.

Climate change caused by global warming has led to disasters in many countries around the world. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for "taking specific measures against climate change." The time has come for humanity to think concretely about ways to suppress the increase in greenhouse gases, which ate thought to be the cause of global warming, and to actually implement them. Among the known greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) accounts for about 75% and is recognized as an important target. Various efforts have already been made to reduce CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, in order to reduce the amount of CO 2 emitted into the atmosphere, technologies for geological storage and conversion of CO 2 are indispensable. CO 2 becomes a resource if it can be converted into useful industrial resources such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, or hydrocarbons in processes that utilize surplus or renewable energy. Many electrochemical reduction techniques have been studied for CO 2 conversion, and Dr. Yoshio Hori has conducted a comprehensive study of electrochemical reduction of CO 2 using metal electrocatalysts1). It has been clarified that the products are different depending on the metal species, and studies are underway to change the surface morphology and crystal planes of metal electrodes and to combine multiple metals in metal electrocatalysts. These previous studies were to reveal that the adsorption strength of CO 2 and electrodes is based on the metal type of the electrode, and that changing the electrode metal changes the path, efficiency, and products of the electrochemical reduction reaction. The object of this research is to take a bird's-eye view of the characteristics of CO 2 electrochemical reduction using copper-based alloy plating electrodes, which we have been development. Among metal electrodes, copper, which can produce hydrocarbons, has been the most widely studied for CO 2 electrochemical reduction. When a copper-cobalt electrode is prepared by alloy plating, the ratio of the hydrocarbons, methane and ethylene, changes depending on the mixing ratio of cobalt. In this copper-cobalt electrode, cobalt exists as a substituted solid solution in the copper crystal structure, and it is considered that the generation efficiency of ethylene is reduced and that of methane is increased due to the inhibition of C-C bonding. When copper-tin electrodes are prepared by alloy plating, unlike cobalt, a solid solution or an intermetallic compound may be formed depending on the ratio of copper and tin. Since the atomic radii of tin atoms are quite different from those of copper atoms, tin atoms do not exist only in substituted solid solution as in the case of cobalt, but their crystal structure changes. The reduction properties of CO 2 electrochemical reduction at a copper-tin electrode were changed. Copper produces hydrocarbons and tin produces formic acid as the main products of CO 2 electrochemical reduction, while carbon monoxide is produced as the main product at a copper/tin ratio of 87:13. Computational chemistry studies predict that the formation of hydrocarbons by copper is via the two-electron reduction product carbon monoxide. The presence of tin near the copper atoms is considered to weaken the adsorption between copper and carbon monoxide. The modeling of the adsorption and the attempt to elucidate the cause by computational science revealed that the tin atoms are weakly bonded to the reaction intermediates and act only as the active sites for the formation of formic acid. It was found that the copper atom weakens the bond with carbon monoxide due to the presence of the tin atom next to the copper atom, and that it decreases the amount of adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. It is reported that the amount of carbon monoxide adsorbed on copper atoms is important for the formation of hydrocarbons, which is stabilized by the formation of hydrogen bonds with CHO*, the reaction intermediate to hydrocarbons. These results suggest that the adsorbed carbon monoxide is destabilized, and carbon monoxide is desorbed from the copper atom, resulting in an increase in carbon monoxide as a product.

Introduction In recent years, there has been growing interest in converting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a greenhouse gas, into a valuable resource. The electrolytic reduction method, which uses only water and electricity, offers a particularly clean approach to CO 2 conversion. Its high conversion efficiency at ambient temperature and pressure, facilitated by gas diffusion electrodes (GDE), makes it a promising option for widespread adoption. Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction using GDE selectively yields carbon monoxide, ethylene, and formic acid with Ag, Cu, or Sn catalysts, respectively 1) . These catalysts are often supported on conductive carbon black (CB), valued for its high electrical conductivity and porosity. However, CB-based catalysts encounter challenges like redox-induced degradation and high CO 2 overvoltage. So, we turned to plasma in liquid as a new method for making electrocatalysts. Plasma in liquid is generated by subjecting a metal in solution to high-frequency, high-voltage conditions. This process enables the sputtering of metal onto powder samples dispersed in solution, with the metal surface instantly heated to high temperatures. This process can improve electrochemical properties like oxygen deficiency 2) . Consequently, plasma treatment in liquid presents an opportunity to utilize highly durable and chemically resistant metal oxides as catalyst base materials. The objective of this study was to synthesize a new catalyst for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction using titanium dioxide as the catalyst base via in-liquid plasma. Titanium dioxide offers advantages of affordability, durability, and chemical resistance. Moreover, oxygen-deficient TiO 2 with enhanced conductivity finds application as a base material for batteries. Experimental In the experiments, high-frequency high voltage (4 kV, 100 kHz, 0.5 µs-Pulse Width) was applied under the same conditions to various metal electrodes in a 5.0 wt%-NH 4 solution (200 mL) containing dispersed TiO 2 (P25: 0.5 g) to generate plasma in the liquid. Common plasma electrodes included tungsten (W), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu). Each gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was prepared by washing the powder after in-liquid plasma treatment with pure water, followed by spray coating on a gas diffusion layer with Nafion dispersion as a binder. Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction was evaluated in a conventional three-chamber gas diffusion cell at 500 mA/cm 2 for 10 minutes. The CO 2 supplied to the gas chamber was collected in a Tedlar bag, and the CO 2 reduction products were analyzed by gas chromatography. Results and Discussion Figure shows the CO 2 reduction products and Faraday efficiency of P25 treated with various liquid plasma electrodes. In pristine P25, small amounts of CO and CH 4 were detected due to the redox cycle of Ti 4+ and Ti 3+ . The use of tungsten (W), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu) as in-liquid plasma electrodes increased the production of H 2 , CO, and CH 4 , respectively. The difference in conversion can be attributed to the fact that the amount of etched Cu is less than that of Ag. Additionally, black nanoparticles were dispersed in the filtered solution when Ag was used, while the solution turned a clear blue color with Cu, suggesting the formation of a complex with ammonia. Generally, oxidized metal nanoparticles are synthesized when plasma is generated in solution. In this study, since an alkaline solution was used, it can be considered that the oxidized Ag nanoparticle surfaces were reduced, resulting in highly dispersed reduced Ag nanoparticles being deposited. In contrast, the generated Cu nanoparticles impregnated TiO 2 by dissolving in ammonia and exhibited catalytic activity. CH 4 significantly affects Faraday efficiency relative to the amount produced because CO and H are two-electron reactions, while CH 4 is an eight-electron reaction, requiring four times as many electrons. Although C 2 H 4 is produced by Cu nanoparticles at sufficient current density, the present results show increased CH 4 production. This may be due to TiO 2 promoting the hydrogenation of CO 2 before Cu forms the C-C bond. Further investigation is required. Conclusions In this study, TiO 2 underwent treatment with various in-liquid plasma electrodes for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction. As a result, changing the electrode allowed for successful support of metal nanoparticles on TiO 2 , resulting in selectivity of CO 2 reduction products. During the presentation, we will discuss the comparison with conductive carbon black (CB) and the changes in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction characteristics under different plasma conditions in liquid. Compared to pristine P25, the production of CO increased by 9.5-fold from 40 to 380 μmol, and CH 4 increased by 2.0-fold from 20 to 40 μmol. Reference 1) Sassenburg et al., ACS Appl.

Research on CO 2 conversion into valuable materials has attracted much attention, aiming to realize carbon neutrality and carbon-negative emission technology. It has been reported that the unique physicochemical properties of high-temperature molten salt, such as high conductivity and wide electrochemical window, make it possible to obtain solid carbon directly from CO 2 and metal carbides. In this study, we focused on the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 in high-temperature chloride melt. CaC 2 is the raw material for acetylene, the starting material for various chemical products. This study demonstrated the selective formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 by an electrochemical process in NaCl-KCl-CaCl 2 -CaO melt at 823 K to produce C 2 H 2 with high current efficiency. When the inert material for oxygen evolution in the high-temperature melts was used as the anode, the formation of acetylene and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water can be realized as the total reaction. 2CO 2 + H 2 O → C 2 H 2 + 5/2O 2 On the metal cathode, the CaC 2 was formed through two reactions: the carbon electrodeposition from CO 2 -derived CO 3 2− (Step 1) and the electrochemical reduction of Ca(II) ion on the carbon (Step 2). These two reactions could be controlled by conducting potentiostatic electrolysis under CO 2 and Ar atmospheres, resulting in acetylene synthesis with a maximum current efficiency of 92%. The electrolysis on carbon electrodes revealed that the higher the crystallinity of carbon, the more selectively CaC 2 was formed. The CaC 2 formation was induced by the reduction of Ca(II) ions on the basal plane of the graphite layer rather than the edge plane. The unique interfacial phenomenon between high-temperature melt and a carbon electrode surface will contribute to realizing a highly efficient CO 2 conversion process to acetylene. It was found that the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 tends to proceed at the basal plane of the graphite layer. This reaction mechanism is entirely different from the interlayer reactions that tend to occur in LIBs and is unique to this electrolytic system at the carbon/molten salt interface. The obtained data will provide a highly efficient process for CO 2 resource conversion and physicochemical insights into new carbon surface reactions.

Solar fuels produced by electrocatalysis have a great potential to reduce the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 and make the production of fuels and chemicals more sustainable. The composition of an electrocatalyst employed for the production of solar fuels is key, ideally the catalyst should be made of abundant elements that can be found anywhere in the world. In this sense, organic molecules composed of light elements such as C, H, O, N, P and S fulfill this requirement. In addition, the extensive advances in the field of organic synthesis make possible to study the active sites, tune them at molecular level, synthesize them and scale the process with ease. In recent years, a handful of nitrogenated heterocycles have been reported for water oxidation, hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction. Special interest exists in our group on the study of benzothiadiazole based electrocatalysts for reduction reactions due to their favorable redox properties and their affinity towards different chemical species (H + and CO 2 ) relevant for the production of solar fuels. In this talk we will present recent efforts of our group to employ benzothiadiazoles in reactions relevant for electrocatalytic production of fuels.

Observing key intermediates directly on the catalyst surface poses a significant challenge in various photo/electrocatalytic processes, including CO 2 reduction and O 2 reduction reactions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms, it is essential to conduct combined studies utilizing complementary tools such as electrochemical characterization, computational calculations, and operando spectroscopies. Among these, time-resolved attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) stands out as particularly suited for investigating electrochemical CO 2 RR due to its ability to observe interfacial processes in real-time with high surface sensitivity. Time-resolved analysis offered by ATR-SEIRAS allows for the exploration of the kinetic relevance of intermediates and their dynamics in relation to reactants and products during the reaction. Furthermore, integrating operando spectroscopic studies with material characterization enables the correlation of intermediate behavior with catalyst conditions. In this context, I will introduce in situ time-resolved FT-IR (or ATR mode) spectroscopic techniques to capture isotopically labeled products and key intermediates generated during the photoreduction of carbon dioxide.

The growing concerns over the high energy consumption of buildings challenge design and construction parties to grow a deeper understanding of sustainable design practices and carbon footprint reduction in construction. With emerging technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and its associated tools, it is now possible to analyze various design models and decide on their implications on environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Although these tools are effective in estimating carbon emissions in the project’s design stages, working with several material alternatives throughout the project’s life cycle requires further comprehension of how CO 2 emissions can be diminished with sustainable design decisions. This study presents a comprehensive two-step analysis linking BIM and energy analysis software to compare the impact of conventional versus sustainable design parameters and their implications on CO 2 emissions. The proposed framework includes simulating the energy consumption of commercial building case studies. Using BIM and energy analysis software, design parameters are evaluated from an energy use intensity (EUI) perspective. The implications of using the conventional versus sustainable design are reflected in a range of CO 2 emissions. The second part of the methodology includes a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the real-world case studies with and without sustainable design implications. This methodology will help designers identify the intensity of their design decisions on energy use and carbon emissions throughout the building life cycle. The seamless and user-friendly application of this framework will help design parties expedite decisions during the first stages of their projects.

The electrocatalytic hydrogen cycle with nitrogen and carbon resources is of emerging interest for renewable energy and environment. Among nitrogen species, electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH 3 ) from N 2 or NO x and urea (CO(NH 2 ) 2 ) from N 2 or NO x together with CO 2 have attracted great attention with substantial progress in recent years as clean and energy-saving approach, to potentially replace the commercialized energy- & capital-intensive Haber-Bosch process. In order to accelerate the ammonia production rate, nitric oxide (NO) can be employed and converted to ammonia with high selectivity by capturing NO with FeII-EDTA. 1) However, low concentration and the low solubility of NO (~1.94 mM in water at 25°C) is expected to affect ammonia production rate from direct electrochemical NO reduction reaction (NORR) in aqueous electrolytes. In order further increase the ammonia production rate, we employed a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to circumvent the mass transport issue with a dilute NO gas. 2) In addition, urea was successfully synthesized using Cu with atomic-scale spacings between copper facets, which lowers the energy barrier for C-N coupling and enhances the reaction kinetics, therefore leading to improved urea formation from co-reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate in a flow-cell system. 3) 1) ACS Energy Lett., 2020, 5, 3647-3656. 2) ACS Energy Lett., 2022, 7, 958-965. 3) Energy Environ.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) holds promise for mitigating carbon emissions and reuse CO 2 for chemical synthesis and energy storage. Among various catalysts, copper-palladium (Cu-Pd) shows potential for converting CO 2 into valuable hydrocarbons (C 2+ products). However, the efficiency of Cu-Pd catalysts is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during CO 2 RR. To tackle this issue, we have developed and analyzed Cu-Pd bimetallic catalysts with varying ratios of copper to palladium to understand the mechanisms underlying HER and its impact on CO 2 electrolyzer performance. Utilizing in-situ Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, Ex-situ Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, and X-ray Photon Spectroscopy, we have identified three detrimental effects of HER during CO 2 reduction: (i) formation of carbonate salt precipitates causing cathode clogging, (ii) mechanical damage to the ion exchange membrane, and (iii) facilitation of anode catalyst crossover. The precipitation of salts on the cathode flow field and gas diffusion layer hinders CO 2 diffusion to the catalyst surface during electrolysis. Notably, we observe catalyst crossover from the anode to the cathode, potentially exacerbating HER during CO 2 RR. These processes adversely affect the long-term durability of CO 2 electrolyzers and necessitate a comprehensive understanding and strategies for mitigation. Figure 1

Global energy demand has increased significantly due to world population growth and the industrialization of developing economies. Energy production has been based mainly on fossil-fuel energy, which has increased global warming due to the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide. According to the Energy Institute, renewable power generation through wind, solar, and other renewable sources, represent only 40,86% of energy sources in 2022 [1]. An alternative energy source for fossil fuels is hydrogen, which can be produced through renewable resources that increase energy efficiency. However, the storage and transportation of hydrogen present a series of technical challenges, resulting in high costs and motivating the development of intermediate technologies. Recently, ammonia generated by renewable energy sources has gained significant attention as an energy carrier, a medium to store and transport chemical energy, and directly as fuel [2]. Ammonia is also a primary raw material for making inorganic fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, synthetic fibers, resins, and other applications, benefiting nearly half the world's population. Ammonia can be transported more efficiently and safely than hydrogen in tanker vessels or pipelines due to its relative ease of being liquefied at room temperature and moderate pressure, increasing energy density. Currently, ammonia is produced mainly from hydrogen and nitrogen by the Haber-Bosch process, which utilizes fossil fuel, thus resulting in carbon dioxide emissions. Ammonia production can also involve the non-spontaneous nitrogen reduction reaction by electrochemical techniques, which uses hydrogen that can be provided from the water, reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. However, the non-spontaneous nitrogen reduction reaction has low activity, and its voltage is close to that of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Plasma and electrothermal chemical cycle methods have been explored to improve the selectivity of non-spontaneous nitrogen reduction reactions. Several studies have proposed new catalysts to increase the active sites, modify the size and morphology of particles, and introduce defects, such as transition metal-based catalysts, carbon-based catalysts, phosphorus-based catalysts, etc. Nevertheless, traditional catalysts frequently degrade rapidly due to the harsh chemical environment and the inherent corrosiveness of the reactions involved. A highly active catalyst that degrades quickly due to corrosion offers limited practical value. Researchers are exploring novel materials like high-entropy alloys (HEAs) to address this challenge, which also have high corrosion resistance [3]. This study focuses on the potential of a HEA, FeCrMnNiCo, as a catalyst for the electrochemical conversion of nitrogen to ammonia via the electrochemical method, evaluating the influence of the microstructure on its mechanical properties, catalytic activity, and corrosion resistance. A ball burnishing deformation was applied to the HEA at different conditions. The X-ray diffraction revealed that the FeCrMnNiCo alloy presented a face-centered cubic crystalline structure, and scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the alloying elements were segregated in the deformed samples. The mechanical deformation determined both catalytic activity and corrosion resistance of the HEA. This study highlights the importance of considering corrosion resistance as a crucial factor in developing catalysts for green ammonia production.

Ship-based transport of CO2 is crucial in developing a carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure. Lowering the ship transport pressure of liquid CO2 from the conventional 14–18 to 7 bar increases the vessel-based transport capacity, leading to significant cost reductions. However, this reduction in pressure necessitates stringent water dew point control measures to prevent the formation of ice and CO2 hydrates, which could block pipelines and equipment. The capital and energy demands of complete dehydration of CO2 increase the CAPEX and the OPEX of the system. It is therefore important to know the limits for water content in the CO2 stream and the consequences if this system cannot reach the dehydration specification due to operational upsets. This study experimentally investigated possible solid formation under CO2 liquefaction for ship transport conditions at 16 and 7 bar, containing varying water concentrations. Using a CO2 stream from a postcombustion amine-based capture plant to represent a realistic CO2 composition, five tests were conducted at different liquefaction pressures and water contents. The experimental results were compared to the hydrate equilibrium predictions for pure CO2. It was found that, for low-pressure CO2 liquefaction with 200 ppm water, signs of solid formation started to occur at about 6.7 bar, which led to complete blocking of the filter over the course of approximately 1 h as the pressure was further reduced to 6.5 bar. This is clearly above the triple point pressure, so the solids that formed were most likely hydrates. For low-pressure CO2 liquefaction with 100 ppm of water operating very close to the triple point and the hydrate formation area, there was no increase in the pressure drop across the filter. For medium-pressure CO2 liquefaction at 16 bar, no indication of solid formation was observed with a water content of 200 and 300 ppm. These findings show the effects of exceeding the current water specification during liquefaction of low- and medium-pressure CO2 for ship transport.

This paper investigates the impact of electrical load management on reducing exhaust gas emissions in Landing Platform Dock (LPD) class vessels. The study focuses on the implementation of Integrated Fully Electric Propulsion (IFEP) systems and Variable Speed Drives (VSD) to enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental impact. The conventional Diesel Engine Propulsion system in LPD vessels often results in high fuel consumption and significant emissions, particularly under non-optimal operating conditions. By transitioning to an IFEP system and optimizing electrical load management using VSD, the study demonstrates a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and sulfur oxides (SOₓ) emissions. The results indicate a potential emission reduction of up to 40%, alongside a 20% improvement in overall energy efficiency. Additionally, the operational benefits of these technologies include increased flexibility, reduced maintenance costs, and extended equipment lifespan. The findings underscore the importance of adopting advanced propulsion and load management technologies in naval vessels to meet stricter environmental regulations and support sustainable maritime operations. This study provides a framework for future research and practical applications in expanding these technologies across different ship types and operational scenarios.

Facing the critical challenges of climate change and the escalating need for sustainable carbon management, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 emerges as a pivotal strategy for carbon recycling and the production of renewable energy. This approach addresses the imperative to mitigate CO2 emissions while harnessing the potential of electrochemical processes to transform CO2 into ethanol, a valuable renewable fuel. Unlike conventional methods reliant on biomass, which are limited by significant land use and potential environmental repercussions, electrochemical CO2 reduction offers a sustainable and efficient alternative. It enables the direct conversion of CO2 from its most oxidized state into more energetically favorable products through a process that integrates water splitting and CO2 hydrogenation into a single electrochemical step. This not only simplifies the conversion process but also facilitates the synthesis of products difficult to achieve through thermal processes, operating at or near ambient conditions to minimize energy consumption and environmental impact. Central to our study is the experimental approach using flow cells and MEA cells, which are primarily utilized for the large-scale electrochemical conversion of CO2. Both systems enable high-current density reactions (large-scale processing) by continuously flowing electrolyte, thus achieving mass processing capabilities. The dilution of reaction products within the electrolyte presents a significant challenge. Additionally, in the case of an MEA cell, there's the issue of the produced products undergoing oxidation at the anode, causing problems in stability during operation. Therefore, an economical method is needed to separate the products within the electrolyte. To overcome this, our research innovatively integrates a pervaporation system employing zeolite-based membranes within a flow cell configuration. This setup allows for the effective concentration of ethanol produced in the electrochemical reduction process, addressing the significant challenge of product dilution in the electrolyte. In our efforts to generate ethanol electrochemically, we utilized a Cu-based catalyst, conducting experiments in both neutral and alkaline electrolyte environments. It was observed that ethanol forms in real-time through the electrochemical reactions at concentrations lower than 1wt%. Furthermore, we successfully implemented a pervaporation process using a hydrophobic all-silica zeolite membrane. The pervaporation process using a hydrophobic all-silica zeolite membrane can selectively separate low concentrations of ethanol from catholyte due to the high selectivity of the zeolite membrane. In this study, we fabricated an MFI type silicalite-1 membrane on a tubular support and investigated the selective removal of ethanol in a water/ethanol mixture. The silicalite-1 membrane has a high Si/Al ratio and exhibits high molecular-level ethanol selectivity. In addition, the membrane has high chemical stability, making it applicable to long-term operation under harsh conditions. As a results, we achieved an ethanol concentration in the permeate of over 50% under conditions where < 1 wt% ethanol was present in the feed. This not only addresses the challenge of separating ethanol from highly diluted streams but also significantly improves the sustainability and scalability of the overall process. Our research underscores the potential of integrating advanced separation technologies in carbon recycling, offering a promising route for the environmentally friendly utilization of CO2 and contributing to the advancement of renewable energy solutions Ref) CO2 Electrolyzers.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO 2 R) holds great promise for producing valuable chemicals and fuels while mitigating carbon emissions. However, challenges arise from the need to enhance CO 2 transport and operate at higher current densities. Despite the development of gas diffusion electrodes, operating at higher current densities generates hydroxide ions at the cathode, promoting the formation of carbonate ions, which can cause salt precipitation and flooding, hindering CO 2 mass transport. To investigate the potential degradation of eCO 2 R of copper gas diffusion electrode (Cu GDE), we utilize X-ray tomography, a nondestructive method for visualizing morphological changes. Through in-line gas chromatography, we track salt precipitation and flooding in the GDE, correlating these changes with shifts in product distribution during eCO 2 R. Our findings reveal that the degradation of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cells is linked to the extent of precipitation and flooding. Furthermore, micro-CT imaging captures morphological changes, such as precipitation growth, dissolution, and regrowth from the Cu surface to the gas diffusion layer, during transient oscillatory voltage profiles and selectivity changes in Cu GDE. This study sheds light on the degradation mechanism of MEA cells and offers insights into strategies for enhancing device durability.

Understanding the role of metal promoter in CO2 methanation is essential for advancing catalyst design and developing efficient methanation catalysts. Herein, a series of mesoporous Ti-promoted silica materials with different Ti-loadings was synthesized via the aerosol-assisted sol-gel process. These materials possess a spherical morphology with high specific surface area and homogeneous distribution of dispersed Ti species, even at Ti-loading as high as 16 mol%, thus allowing to investigate the role of Ti as a promoter in silica-supported Ru CO2 methanation catalysts. Keeping the Ru loading constant, higher Ti loadings (up to 12 mol%) lead to superior catalytic activity in CO2 methanation. At 300 C, the Ru-mass-normalized CO2 conversion rate of Ru/12%Ti-SiO2 catalyst is 2.3 times higher than that of unpromoted Ru/SiO2 catalyst. The improved activity correlates well with the smaller crystallite size of RuO2 nanoparticles, which translates to higher Ru dispersion after reductive treatment with H2. Overall, Ti helps stabilize Ru species and impedes crystal growth. With a Ti loading of 12 mol%, the crystallization of small anatase TiO2 is induced after RuO2 impregnation and during subsequent calcination, in turn forming the interfacial contact between Ru and TiO2 after H2 reduction. In-situ DRIFTS suggests that the promotion of CO2 activation and CO adsorption at these interfacial sites is responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity in Ti-promoted Ru-SiO2 methanation catalyst.

Electrochemical processes are less energy intensive than thermal processes, especially for inner sphere reactions such as HER (H 2 evolution reaction), HOR (H 2 oxidation reaction), OER (O 2 evolution reaction), ORR (O 2 reduction reaction), CO2RR (CO 2 reduction reaction), and NH 3 generation. Energetic costs and environmental burdens are lowered electrochemically, provided an appropriate electrocatalyst can be identified. Often, electrocatalysts are identified through edisonian surveys. Here, a more fundamental approach to identifying catalysts is posed as magnetoelectrocatalysis. Magnetic gradients drive electron transfer reactions across the electrode solution interface. This increases rates and efficiency, to lower energetic and environmental taxes. Demonstrated magnetoelectrocatalysis is presented for HER [1,2], ORR [3-5], and single carbon species electrochemistry including CO2RR [6]. Fundamental approaches to identifying effective magnetoelectrocatalysts are presented.

Development of highly active electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction has been intensively investigated for the efficient utilization of CO 2 and the lowering of electric energy consumption. Among various strategies, alloy nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted significant interest due to their tunable catalytic properties, which can be adjusted by altering their chemical composition and particle size. Recently, we reported novel preparation methods of metal nanoparticles through the sputter deposition of metals onto room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), a technique we termed “RTIL/metal sputtering technique”. This method enabled the formation of metal and alloy NPs, such as Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, AuAg, AuCu, AuPt and AuRh,(1-6) with sizes in the nanometer ranges, in the absence of additional stabilizing agents. Here we report the preparation of AuCu alloy NPs via RTIL/metal sputtering and evaluate their electrocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction as a function of the alloy composition. The simultaneous sputtering of Au and Cu onto RTILs produced AuCu alloy NPs with the size ranging from 3 to 4 nm. Subsequent loading of these sputter-deposited AuCu NPs in RTIL on carbon black powders (CB) not only increased the AuCu NP size to 3-7 nm but also facilitated alloying between Au and Cu. The chemical composition of AuCu NPs was controlled by changing the area fraction of Au plates in Au-Cu binary targets used for sputtering. The XRD analysis revealed that thus-obtained AuCu NPs had the fcc structure, in which each peak shifted to a lower angle with an increase in the Au fraction. The prepared AuCu/CB powers were immobilized on glassy carbon electrodes and used for the electrocatalyst for CO 2 reduction in a 0.5 M KHCO 3 aqueous solution. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that cathodic currents were observed at potentials more negative than -1.2 V, with the current intensity being higher under a CO 2 atmosphere compared to an N 2 atmosphere. This confirms the CO 2 reduction activity of AuCu nanoparticles. Constant potential electrolysis was carried out at -2 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a CO 2 atmosphere. As CO 2 reduction products, CO and HCOOH were formed. The selectivity of these products was remarkably influenced by the composition of AuCu alloy NPs: The HCOOH selectivity increased with a higher Cu ratio, while the CO selectivity showed a volcano-type relationship, reaching an optimum at the Au fraction in NPs of ca. 0.8. H 2 was also produced as a byproduct, with its selectivity being minimized at the Au fraction of 0.6-0.9. In conclusion we demonstrated the importance of alloy composition in optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of AuCu NPs for CO 2 reduction. References T. Torimoto, et al., Appl. Phys.

The reaction microenvironment plays a key role in dictating the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, understanding the chemical nature of this microenvironment under operating conditions remains a substantial challenge. We employed attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) in operando for simultaneous measurements of reaction kinetics and concentrations of reactants and intermediates at the reaction interface, all under controlled mass transport conditions. These operando measurements enable direct correlations between the reaction microenvironment, mass transport, and kinetics for a Cu electrocatalyst, such as higher local concentrations of CO2 under faster mass transport corresponding to higher rates of CO2 reduction. We observed that faster mass transport decreased the *CO coverage at less negative potentials (−0.6 VRHE) and increased the *CO coverage at more negative potentials (−1.1 VRHE). We developed a transport-coupled kinetic model that captures these spectroscopic observations and provides insight into the processes controlling interfacial concentrations of reactants and intermediates, aiding future efforts toward tailoring reaction microenvironments.

In 2023, global carbon dioxide emissions climbed to a staggering new high of 37.4 metric tons, a grim situation driven primarily by the massive consumption of fossil fuels, particularly coal. In this context, the offshore wind power industry has emerged as a key part of tackling climate change and emission reduction challenges. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of how productive factors and public policy work together to shape the development of the offshore wind industry in the United States and China, highlighting the importance of land availability, labor market quality and size, and capital investment flows in shaping the future of the industry. At the same time, the paper also carefully examines how the government can effectively attract and promote investors to participate in offshore wind power projects through a series of public policies, such as tax incentives, subsidies and other financial incentives. The results show that China has a clear lead in the offshore wind market compared to the United States. This paper aims to make insightful suggestions for the sustainable development of offshore wind power industry in both countries through comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the two countries.

Abstract. While international climate policies now focus on limiting global warming to well below 2 °C or pursuing a 1.5 °C level of global warming, the climate modelling community has not provided an experimental design in which all Earth system models (ESMs) converge and stabilize at the same prescribed global warming levels. This gap hampers accurate estimations based on comprehensive ESMs of the carbon emission pathways and budgets needed to meet such agreed warming levels and of the associated climate impacts under temperature stabilization. Here, we apply the Adaptive Emission Reduction Approach (AERA) with ESMs to provide such simulations in which all models converge at 1.5 and 2.0 °C warming levels by adjusting their emissions over time. These emission-driven simulations provide a wide range of emission pathways and resulting atmospheric CO2 projections for a given warming level, uncovering uncertainty ranges that were previously missing in the traditional Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) scenarios with prescribed greenhouse gas concentration pathways. Meeting the 1.5 °C warming level requires a 40 % (full model range: 7 % to 76 %) reduction in multi-model mean CO2-forcing-equivalent (CO2-fe) emissions from 2025 to 2030, a 98 % (57 % to 127 %) reduction from 2025 to 2050, and a stabilization at 1.0 (−1.7 to 2.9) PgC yr−1 from 2100 onward after the 1.5 °C global warming level is reached. Meeting the 2.0 °C warming level requires a 47 % (8 % to 92 %) reduction in multi-model mean CO2-fe emissions until 2050 and a stabilization at 1.7 (−1.5 to 2.7) PgC yr−1 from 2100 onward. The on-average positive emissions under stabilized global temperatures are the result of a decreasing transient climate response to cumulative CO2-fe emissions over time under stabilized global warming. This evolution is consistent with a slightly negative zero emissions commitment – initially assumed to be zero – and leads to an increase in the post-2025 CO2-fe emission budget by a factor of 2.2 (−0.8 to 6.9) by 2150 for the 1.5 °C warming level and a factor of 1.4 (0.9 to 2.4) for the 2.0 °C warming level compared to its first estimate in 2025. The median CO2-only carbon budget by 2150, relative to 2020, is 800 GtCO2 for the 1.5 °C warming level and 2250 GtCO2 for the 2.0 °C warming level. These median values exceed the median IPCC AR6 estimates by 60 % for the 1.5 °C warming level and 67 % for 2.0 °C. Some of the differences may be explained by the choice of the mitigation scenario for non-CO2 radiative agents. Our simulations highlight shifts in carbon uptake dynamics under stabilized temperature, such as a cessation of the carbon sinks in the North Atlantic and in tropical forests. On the other hand, the Southern Ocean remains a carbon sink centuries after temperatures stabilize. Overall, this new type of warming-level-based emission-driven simulation offers a more coherent assessment across climate models and opens up a wide range of possibilities for studying both the carbon cycle and climate impacts, such as extreme events, under climate stabilization.

<p>Aviation, as a critical component of the global transportation infrastructure, has experienced substantial growth over the past few decades, facilitating the movement of people and goods. However, this sector is also a significant consumer of fossil fuels and contributor to global warming. In this study, we estimated the carbon dioxide (CO$ _2 $) emissions from global aviation for the period between 2019 to June 2024 using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We estimate that a yearly total of 42 million of flights were responsible for 895 Mt of CO$ _2 $ emissions in 2019. Flight disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have decreased emissions during the years 2020–2023, but the recovery has been quick: the number of domestic flights in 2023 surpassed its pre-Covid level while international flights were slightly lagging behind. This results in CO$ _2 $ emissions in 2023 that were still 9% below their pre-Covid levels. However, traffic and emissions levels calculated for 2024 indicate a return to pre-Covid levels. Our analysis indicates that North America, Europe, and Asia account for almost 75% of the aviation CO$ _2 $ emissions. Flights shorter than 2600 km are responsible for 50% of the aviation CO$ _2 $ emissions worldwide. Flights longer than this distance account for the other half of emissions, although they represent less than 15% of the total number of flights. The most recent generation of aircraft represented 20% of the fleet at the start of 2024, resulting in an 8% gain in efficiency, equivalent to 144 Mt CO$ _2 $ avoided over the whole period. However, the ongoing growth in traffic delays the fleet renewal and hinders the reduction in emissions. Aviation does not appear to be on track to reach a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030. Additionally, if sustainable aviation fuels are to be used, this will require a substantial increase in biomass or low-carbon electricity use.</p>

Aiming at the challenges of rapid heat dissipation, limited swept efficiency, and a rapid water cut increase in steam huff and puff development in heavy oil reservoirs, an alternating steam and CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff method for IOR was proposed. In this work, the effect of CO2 on the physical properties of heavy oil was evaluated, and the optimal concentration of viscosity reducer for synergistic interaction between CO2 and the viscosity reducer was determined. Next, novel huff and puff simulation experiments by three sandpack models of different sizes in series were analyzed. Then, the IOR difference between the pure steam huff and puff experiments and the steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff were compared. Finally, the CO2 storage rate was obtained based on the principle of the conservation of matter. The results show that the optimal viscosity reducer concentration, 0.8 wt%, can achieve a 98.5% reduction after combining CO2. The steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff reached about 45 cm at 80 °C in the fifth cycle due to the CO2/viscosity reducer effects. CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff significantly reduces water cut during cold production, with an ultimate IOR 15.89% higher than pure steam huff and puff. The viscosity reducer alleviates heavy oil blockages, and CO2 decreases oil viscosity and enhances elastic repulsion energy. The highest CO2 storage rate of 76.8% occurs in the initial stage, declining to 15.2% by the sixth cycle, indicating carbon sequestration potential. These findings suggest that steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff improves heavy oil reservoir development and provides theoretical guidance for optimizing steam huff and puff processes.

Chemical looping combustion (CLC) technology offers cost-effective CO2 emission reduction. Coal direct chemical looping (CDCL) emerges as a promising solid fuel CLC technology owing to its ability to directly utilize coal without prior gasification, enhancing system integration and efficiency. Despite significant progress in CDCL, challenges persist, including carbon deposition and insufficient oxidation and reduction of oxygen carriers (OCs). This study conducted a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of a CDCL combustion reactor using Cantera 3.0, a chemical calculation module developed at the California Institute of Technology. The analysis explored the impact of different temperatures, OC-to-coal molar ratios (θ), and OCs types on combustion products. By employing the minimum Gibbs function method and analyzing intrinsic reaction mechanisms, the study provides insights for predicting and optimizing system performance. Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis revealed that with CuO as the OC, insufficient OC (θ < 0.6) led to Cu as the reduction product, while sufficient OC (0.6 < θ < 1.3) yielded Cu and CuO, and excess OC (θ > 1.3) resulted in Cu2O. To optimize CO2 capture, a molar ratio of θ of at least 1.4 and a temperature of at least 800°C are recommended. When Fe2O3 served as the OC, insufficient OC (θ < 0.45) produced Fe and FeO, while excess OC generated FeO and Fe3O4. Optimal operational performance and CO2 capture efficiency required an OC-to-coal molar ratio exceeding 1.4 and a temperature higher than 700°C. This study demonstrates that in CDCL combustion systems, selecting appropriate OCs, temperatures, and OC-to-coal molar ratios ensures stable and efficient combustion and CO2 capture. These findings offer crucial guidance for optimizing system operation.

Summary The CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) technique could increase the oil recovery factor and achieve subsurface CO2 storage. To evaluate the feasibility of CO2-EOR operation, an equation-of-state-based (EOS-based) compositional simulation is inevitable. However, time-consuming multiphase flash calculations limit the application of the conventional EOS-based compositional simulation in large-scale reservoir simulations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to accelerate the EOS-based compositional simulation by reducing the time spent on the multiphase flash calculations. In this study, we develop a fast, multiphase-state identification approach to achieve high computational efficiency of the compositional simulation. First, taking one given point in the compositional space composed by pressure and the overall composition as the original point, the phase-state radius (PSR) is defined as a radius inside which all points have the same phase state as the given point. Subsequently, the results of the multiphase flash calculations of the points in the compositional space are stored. Finally, when a new point is inside the PSR of one calculated point, the stored results are used to accelerate the new multiphase flash calculations of the new point by omitting the phase stability analysis (PSA) and possible additional multiphase split (MS) calculations. Case studies show a 6–10% reduction in multiphase flash computation time compared with two existing methods when the fluid is far from the phase boundary and a reduction of at least 17.5% when the fluid is near the phase boundary.

The urgent global challenge of climate change and the depletion of energy resources have spotlighted the technology of converting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable carbon-based products. The CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) via metal complex molecules is expected to improve and enhance the electronic/chemical environment of the catalytic active sites through control with freely modulable organic ligands. The selectivity for the formation of formic acid and carbon monoxide from CO 2 in organic solvents has been successfully controlled in some molecular catalysts by small structural differences in the ligands. For catalytic reactions in organic solvents, NMR and other common analytical methods can be used to follow structural changes and reaction intermediates during the reaction of unimolecular molecular catalysts. The study of detailed reaction processes has led to ligand design guidelines that contribute to higher reaction rates and improved selectivity. However, analytical methods still need to be developed for heterogeneous molecular catalysts used in water on electrodes. Catalysts capable of producing C 2 products, such as ethylene and ethanol, require methods to detect intermediates in multi-electron reduction processes involving C-C coupling reactions. Current C 2 producing molecular catalysts are known to decompose during reactions, turning into metals and not fully utilizing their precisely controlled active sites. Therefore, developing structurally stable molecular catalysts during reactions is critical to understanding these mechanisms. In this study, we have demonstrated a Br-bridged copper dinuclear molecular catalyst with high robustness for CO 2 /CO reduction reactions, producing C 3+ products including C 3 H 7 OH beyond C 2 products. Operando XAFS and various spectroscopic analyses show that the dinuclear molecular catalyst maintains a stable Cu(I) state during the reduction reaction, preventing decomposition. Operando spectroscopic analysis using localized surface plasmon resonance identifies key C 2 and C 3 coupling intermediates essential for C 3 production. Reaction intermediates obtained by 13 CO 2 -labeled operando analysis were also corroborated. DFT calculations propose a mechanism where the reaction proceeds at room temperature to form C 3 coupling species. The transition state structures resulting from this mechanistic analysis suggest that the progression of C-C coupling in the Cu dinuclear molecular metal complex is facilitated by the formation of a CO 2 /CO-reduced intermediate species that bridges the two Cu active sites. The bridging intermediate can adjust the Cu-Cu distance during the reaction, attracting reducing species to one Cu side and accepting substrate to the other Cu side. C 3 H 7 OH is formed through C-C coupling at the bridging site in flexible Cu binuclear structures. The discovery of a robust molecular catalyst for C 3+ production provides a molecular design guideline for developing next-generation catalysts for multicarbon CO 2 reduction products.

This article employs a Panel Mean Group Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PMG-ARDL) approach to investigate the interaction between carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), fossil fuel, renewable energy consumption, trade, and their collective impact on life expectancy within the BRICS nations. The research reveals compelling findings. Notably, CO 2 emissions and trade openness exhibit negative and statistically significant impact on life expectancy. In contrast, GDP per capita and renewable energy consumption are positive and significant determinants of longer life expectancy. The nuanced outcomes underscore the complex interplay of economic, environmental, and social factors within the BRICS nations. The effects found by PMG-ARDL and FMOLS are very comparable, except for the trade openness’ coefficients, which is the inverse. These findings hold significant implications for policy interpretation and sustainable development strategies. As nations struggle to balance economic growth and environmental improvement with public health, tailored interventions targeting CO 2 reduction, trade openness, renewable energy, and GDP growth can collectively contribute to longer life expectancy. In a broader context, this research contributes to the global discourse on sustainability, economic improvement, and health issue.

In the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R), electrode engineering plays a crucial role in modulating the distribution of complex products. Here, based on multiphysics modeling, we demonstrate that CO2R product selectivity varies spatially along the thickness of the catalyst layer of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE). Our calculations indicate that maintaining a moderately low local CO2 concentration around catalytic sites enables optimal ethanol Faradaic efficiency on Cu. We further developed an optimized electrode using commercial Cu nanoparticles with a low catalyst loading of 0.1 mg cm–2. Even under a low CO2 feed concentration of 30%, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of approximately 65% for ethanol at an industrial-scale current density of–156 mA cm–2 and over 80% for C2+ products, along with a promising cathodic energy efficiency of more than 37% for ethanol. This study serves as a scalable and instructive guide for tuning the local CO2 concentration to achieve optimal production of a single high-selectivity C2+ product.

It is widely recognized that hydrogen is an appropriate fuel for the sustainable energy system because it can be utilized as an energy storage material of intermittent renewable energy sources, and it generate no environmentally harmful products after combustion. However, in region where green hydrogen production cannot follow the need, import is necessary. In this case, transportation and storage of pure hydrogen can be a problem because of the high cost of maintaining liquefied state and low amount of hydrogen in compressed gas. In this regard, ammonia has received much attention as a hydrogen carrier with advantageous properties of relatively mild condition for liquefaction, high volumetric density of hydrogen, and no carbon content. Electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) to extract the hydrogen has been researched as much less energy is required for electrolysis when replacing oxygen evolution reaction to the AOR in aqueous alkaline condition. But high overpotential even when the most active electrocatalyst, platinum, is used and rapid poisoning by strongly adsorbed N species inhibit the practical application. To deal with these problems, there are a lot of on-going researches with various methods and perspectives. In this study, we investigated the effect of alkali metal cations on electrochemical AOR on polycrystalline platinum electrode. With same concentration but different alkali metal cations, measured the activity of platinum was different for the AOR peak (K + > Na + > Li + ≈ Cs + ). The reaction kinetics were also affected, supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel slope. Also, we checked that the alkali metal cation promotes the AOR by comparing the cyclic voltammetry results with and without the cation in ammonia solution. These kinds of cation effects are also demonstrated in other electrochemical reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Mainly, there are two explanations i) the degree of interaction between cations and water structure and reaction intermediates at the interface, ii) the local electric field between electrode and hydrated cation in electric double layer. We will present and discuss the effect of alkali metal cations on the AOR in this point of view and competitive adsorption of water, proton, hydroxide and ammonia on the platinum surface in aqueous alkaline electrolyte.

The development of new technologies for the sustainable transformation of CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals is a promising approach to meet global needs. This paper will cover research efforts to understand electrified interfaces for CO2 reduction. Fundamental studies of well-defined catalyst materials and electrolyte conditions uncover the role of the microenvironment in steering catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability. Studies of more applied platforms with greater complexity provide insights into the roles of mass transfer, flooding, and crystallization. Translating knowledge from model systems to applied platforms is key to enabling high-performance technologies in this space.

CO2 removal, especially the one applied to reduce the emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere (carbon capture, utilization, and storage), is one of the main research topics nowadays because of its great contribution to the reduction in climate change and to making many industrial processes sustainable. In this regard, alternative solvents to the traditional ones are under study with the aim of employing a more sustainable solvent for the environment, health, and society, in comparison with the traditional amine aqueous solutions that are toxic and corrosive. The CO2-binding organic liquids (CO2-BOLs) are a class of components of interest. In this work, the vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for two newly selected binary mixtures based on CO2-BOLs, 1,3-Propanediol+DBU and DBU+Sulfolane, have been experimentally determined at the Process Thermodynamics laboratory (PT lab) of Politecnico di Milano to evaluate the suitability of these mixtures for being a solvent for CO2 removal. All the experiments have been carried out by using the Fischer® Labodest® VLLE 602 unit at a constant pressure of 30 kPa. The densities of the mixtures for all the considered compositions have been determined at atmospheric pressure with a density meter (Mettler Toledo Densito Density2Go). No data on the VLE of these mixtures can be found in the literature. This is the first work focusing on mixtures of these components that could be employed as solvents for CO2 removal as alternative solvents to the monoethanolamine (MEA) aqueous solution in the process of chemical absorption. The collected experimental data have then been used for the definition of the thermodynamic model by considering different possible theories (NRTL, Wilson, and UNIQUAC) that could be employed for the representation of the two systems.

Due to the significance of carbon utilization and storage, CO2 huff and puff is increasingly receiving attention. However, the mechanisms and effects of CO2 huff and puff extraction in medium to deep saturated heavy oil reservoirs remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, by targeting the medium to deep saturated heavy oil reservoirs in the block Xia of the Xinjiang oil field, measurements of physical properties were conducted through PVT analysis and viscosity measurement to explore the dissolution and diffusion characteristics of CO2-degassed and CO2-saturated oil systems. Multiple sets of physical simulation of CO2 huff and puff in medium to deep saturated heavy oil reservoirs were conducted using a one-dimensional core holder to evaluate the EOR mechanism of CO2 huff and puff. The results demonstrate that the solubility of CO2 in degassed crude oil is linearly correlated with pressure. Higher pressure effectively increases the solubility of CO2, reaching 49.1 m3/m3 at a saturation pressure of 10.0 MPa, thus facilitating oil expansion and viscosity reduction. Meanwhile, crude oil saturated with CH4 still retains the capacity to further dissolve additional CO2, reaching 24.5 m3/m3 of incremental CO2 solubilization at 10.0 MPa, and the hybrid effect of CO2 and CH4 reduces oil viscosity to 1161 mPa·s, which is slightly lower than the pure CO2 dissolution case. Temperature increases suppress solubility but promote molecular diffusion, allowing CH4 and CO2 to maintain a certain solubility at high temperatures. In terms of dynamic dissolution and diffusion, the initial CO2 dissolution rate is high, reaching 0.009 m3/(m3·min), the mid-term dissolution rate stabilizes at approximately 0.002 m3/(m3·min), and the dissolution capability significantly decreases later on. CO2 exhibits high molecular diffusion capability in gas-saturated crude oil, with a diffusion coefficient of 8.62 × 10−7 m2/s. For CO2 huff and puff, oil production is positively correlated with the CO2 injection rate and the cycle injection volume; it initially increases with the extension of the soak time but eventually decreases. Therefore, the optimal injection speed, injection volume, and soak time should be determined in conjunction with reservoir characteristics. During the huff and puff process, the bottom hole pressure should be higher than the bubble point pressure of the crude oil to prevent gas escape. Moreover, as the huff and puff cycles increase, the content of saturates in the oil rises, while those of aromatic, resin, and asphaltene decrease, leading to a gradual deterioration of the huff and puff effect. This study provides a comprehensive reference method and conclusions for studying the fluid property changes and enhanced recovery mechanisms in medium to deep heavy oil reservoirs with CO2 huff and puff.

The reaction pathways of CO 2 electrochemical reduction reaction have been barely understood due to lack of direct molecular level information. In this study, we use the surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy with the attenuated total reflection configuration to directly monitor the reaction intermediates of CO2 reductions on both model and nanocatalysts. Reaction mechanisms according to the spectroscopic and theoretical calculation results will be proposed. Rational design of electrocatalysts for these reactions will be presented.

Electricity generation leads to one third of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Standing at the age of direct effect of global warming on global ecosystem, it is required to control global greenhouse gases within limit to avoid global climate alteration. For that, a new concept is proposed in this study for converting CO2 into glucose as well as generating power. Artificial photosynthesis concept is utilized here to design the glucose reactor. Artificial photosynthesis converts CO2 to glucose, integrating principles of carbon fixation, renewable energy, and electrochemistry for sustainable carbon utilization. Furthermore, the synthesized glucose is converted into power in an electrochemical way. A case study has been done based on wind power plant. Therefore, to execute the process, the system is powered by a wind power plant for cleaning the water molecules, CO2 molecule capture, which is synthesized into glucose. Then, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to find how the wind speed is affecting the production of glucose and power-regeneration. The result highlights that the designed system is capable of capturing total emitted CO2 from considered case study within few days. A single unit analysis of glucose reactor is given here. Moreover, the electrochemical system can produce power with that CO2-derived glucose. This concept will be surely benefited for carbon emission reduction, clean power generation, and sustainable development.

This study aims to compare the CO2 emissions from conventional diesel and coconut biodiesel blends from raw material extraction up to use as fuel for public utility jeepneys (PUJs) in the Philippines. This work used the process-based LCA approach with 1 kilometer distance travelled by PUJs as the functional unit. The kg CO2 emissions from coconut farming and harvesting until the use phase of the coconut biodiesel blends in Metro Manila jeepneys were estimated in this work. The calculated emission factor of Coconut Methyl Ester (CME) from its fatty acid composition is 2.5539 kg CO2 per 1 kg CME. The total CO2 emissions in the life cycle of 2% CME blend (B2) and 5% CME blend (B5) were lower by 0.767% and 5.37%, respectively, compared to those from life cycle of neat diesel. In the life cycle of neat diesel, B2 blend, and B5 blend, the use phase contributed 75-78% of the CO2 emissions. The kg CO2 emissions from Metro Manila public utility jeepneys decreased from 0.400kg/ km using neat diesel to 0. 381 kg/km and 0.363 kg/km using B2 blend and B5 blend, respectively. In the life cycle of coconut biodiesel from raw material extraction to CME production, 52-58% of CO2 emissions come from the production of material inputs to the trans-esterification process. Three main recommendations are proposed by this work: (1) Extend the LCA to higher blend percentage. This entails measurement of specific fuel consumption of jeepneys using this fuel. (2) Increase engine efficiencies of Public Utility Jeepneys to reduce fuel consumption and realize higher CO2 emission reductions. (3) Further studies on optimization of mole ratio of methanol to coconut oil in trans-esterification process must be done. Explore use of methanol from sources-other than natural gas- with less CO2 emissions.

Improvement of energy efficiency in technological processes at industrial enterprises is one of the key areas of energy saving. Reduction of energy costs required for the production of energy-intensive products can be achieved through the utilization of waste heat produced by high-temperature thermal furnace units. Generation of electric power based on the waste heat using power cycles with working fluids that are not conventional for large power engineering, may become a promising energy saving trend. In this paper, thermodynamic analysis and optimization of power cycles for the purposes of waste heat recovery are performed. The efficiency of combining several power cycles was also evaluated. It has been established that the combination of the Brayton recompression cycle on supercritical carbon dioxide with the organic Rankine cycle using R124 allows for greater electrical power than steam-power cycles with three pressure circuits under conditions where the gas temperature is in the range of 300–550 °C and the cooling temperature of is up to 80 °C. Additionally, when cooling gases with a high sulfur and moisture content to 150 °C, the combined cycle has greater electrical power at gas temperatures of 330 °C and above. At enterprises where the coolant has a high content of sulfur compounds or moisture and deep cooling of gases will lead to condensation, for example, at petrochemical and non-ferrous metallurgy enterprises, the use of combined cycles can ensure a utilization efficiency of up to 45%.

Despite the reductions in air travel demand during the 2020 pandemic, with a reduction of up to 80% in passenger travel during the peak pandemic period, the air travel demand has already recovered to around 80% of the pre-pandemic level, with aviation emissions in 2022 reaching around 800 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>, accounting for 2% of the global energy related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Moreover, the demand for air travel is expected to double by 2040, growing at an annual average rate of 3.4%, which means that. despite the efficiency improvement trend (average 2%/year), will almost double the aviation’s greenhouse (GHG) emissions, with a significant increase in its relative GHG share, compared to the other transport modes.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">Meanwhile the aviation sector is one of the hardest to decarbonize, with few and costly pathways available.

Electrochemical C–N coupling between CO2 and N-containing small molecules is a promising strategy to close both the carbon and nitrogen loops to support the establishment of a net-zero carbon economy. However, the intricate reaction network and the contentious C–N coupling mechanism hinder the development of efficient electrocatalysts for industrial applications. Herein, we develop a graph-based approach to enable autonomous analysis of the C–N coupling mechanism for coreduction of CO2 and NO3– on single-atom catalysts (SACs). 1400 potential intermediates and 2490 C–N coupling modes are investigated based on the Cu-N4-C prototypical catalyst. We demonstrate that N-containing species with a higher reduction degree are more likely to undergo C–N coupling and the initial coupling of the C–N bond tends to occur on CO2. It is revealed that the hydrogenation energies of *NH2 and CO2, as well as their coupling energies, can serve as key indicators for catalyst recommendation. Using this approach, SACs with Mo, W, or Sb metal centers are identified as promising electrocatalysts for C–N coupling. This work presents a paradigm for automatically exploring the mechanisms of complex electrocatalytic reactions and offers a strategy for predicting highly active and selective SACs.

Abstract Renewable hydrogen (H 2 ) will play a pivotal role in the decarbonization of the energy and industrial sectors. However, during the transition to a clean energy system, the production of H 2 with electrolysis runs the risk of increasing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions if the electricity system is still partly based on fossil fuels. The European Union has set ambitious targets for the production of H 2 and defined strict rules in delegated acts to the Renewable Energy Directive, when H 2 produced with public grid electricity can be counted as renewable. This paper analyzes two grid criteria central to these rules, renewable energy share and CO 2 emission intensity, in several future scenarios of the European energy system. By uniquely focusing on the impact of H _2 production from the perspective of EU grid criteria, this study offers a novel assessment of how these regulations interact with the evolving energy landscape. Fulfillment of the renewable H 2 grid criteria strongly depends on the future build-out of renewable energy resources, electricity demand, and amount of domestically produced H 2 . In a scenario with ambitious renewable build-out until 2030, represented by current drafts of national energy and climate plans, many countries will meet the stated criteria. However, adding a high amount of domestically produced H 2 partly cancels out this effect. In a scenario with reduced renewable build-outs, comparable to historically achieved renewable resource additions, many fewer countries achieve the grid criteria. Finally, net CO 2 emission reductions are analyzed by comparing power sector emission changes with the opportunity emissions that result from fossil fuels replacements with H 2 . The results indicate that using H 2 in CO 2 intensive use cases can lead to emission reductions, even if grid criteria are below the thresholds defined in the delegated acts. However, reduced renewable energy expansion poses the risk of not achieving any emission reductions at all with the produced H 2 .

The increase in CO2 emissions, recognized as a global problem, is significantly influenced by energy consumption. Türkiye, which is among the developing countries, is a country dependent on foreign sources to meet its energy needs. Nevertheless, it satisfies its energy requirements through both renewable and non-renewable sources. The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the impact of consumption from renewable and non-renewable energy sources in Türkiye between 1990 and 2020 on CO2 emissions and investigate the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. We apply the traditional and structural break unit root tests to check whether the variables are stationary. We employed the newly accepted Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method to estimate the long-run relationship between variables. According to the findings, there is a U-shaped relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions. It means that the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is not applicable in Türkiye. Moreover, it concluded that non-renewable energy consumption plays a role in emission increase, while renewable energy consumption is effective in emission reduction.

CNx catalysts show promising activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under acidic conditions, but the nature of the active site is still under debate. ORR on CNx has been found to be resistant to common poisons such as CO, H2S, and CN. In this study, we demonstrate that bubbling CO2 in the electrolyte can lead to the partial poisoning of CNx for ORR activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments show a partial decrease in the ORR activity for CNx catalysts after bubbling CO2 through a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. The relative stability of CO2-derived species (CO2*, H2CO3*, HCO3*, and CO3*) on 13 CNx site models at 1.0 V-RHE was examined using density functional theory (DFT). The calculations predict that HCO3 is favored adjacent to the N species on several CNx site models and CO3 is favored on pyrrolic sites. Difference spectra of the N 1s from near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) of the ex-situ poisoned CNx and pristine CNx shows a shift in binding energies of N species that qualitatively match the DFT N 1s binding energy shifts due to HCO3/CO3 on the CNx site models. DFT predicts that these HCO3 surface species can block and delay the initial step of the ORR on several CNx sites.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory condition predominantly affecting the anogenital region of postmenopausal women. It is associated with considerable aesthetic and functional impairments and an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. While high-potency topical corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of treatment, therapeutic options for patients with refractory LS are scarce. Fractional CO2 laser therapy has emerged as a potential second-line intervention aiming to mitigate symptoms and improve quality of life. This prospective observational study investigated the short-term efficacy and safety of fractional CO2 laser therapy in 75 women with refractory LS who underwent four treatment sessions between January 2022 and February 2024. Sixty-nine patients completed the protocol, demonstrating significant reductions in key symptoms, including pruritus (VAS score from 7.53 ± 3.02 to 4.08 ± 3.07), pain (5.83 ± 3.84 to 2.42 ± 2.85), and dyspareunia (8.26 ± 2.82 to 6.34 ± 3.30). Quality of life, sexual function, and psychological well-being also improved, as evidenced by reductions in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores (10.72 ± 7.25 to 5.94 ± 5.16), enhancements in sexual function (FSFI scores from 10.48 ± 8.46 to 15.52 ± 9.59), and decreased depression severity (BDI scores from 16.66 ± 12.64 to 5.94 ± 5.16). Importantly, no adverse effects were reported during the study period. Although these findings highlight the potential of fractional CO2 laser therapy as a safe and effective adjunct for refractory LS, it is essential to acknowledge the study’s limitations, particularly the relatively short follow-up period. Longer-term studies are warranted to confirm sustained benefits and to evaluate the broader applicability of this approach.

Greening dryland ecosystems greatly benefits from significant CO2 fertilization. This greening trend across global drylands, however, has also been severely constrained by enhancing atmospheric and soil water (SW) deficits. Thus far, the relative offsets in the contributions between the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), SW at varying depths, and CO2 fertilization to vegetation dynamics, as well as the differences in the impacts of decreasing SW at different soil depths on dryland ecosystems over long periods, remain poorly recorded. Here, this study comprehensively explored the relative offsets in the contributions to vegetation dynamics between high VPD, low SW, and rising CO2 concentration across global drylands during 1982–2018 using process-based models and satellite-observed Leaf Area Index (LAI), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). Results revealed that decreasing-SW-induced reductions of LAI in dryland ecosystems were larger than those caused by rising VPD. Furthermore, dryland vegetation was more severely constrained by decreasing SW on the subsurface (7–28 cm) among various soil layers. Notable offsets were found in the contributions between enhanced water constraints and CO2 fertilization, with the former offsetting approximately 38.49% of the beneficial effects of the latter on vegetation changes in global drylands. Process-based models supported the satellite-observed finding that increasing water constraints failed to overwhelmingly offset significant CO2 fertilization on dryland ecosystems. This work emphasizes the differences in the impact of SW at different soil depths on vegetation dynamics across global drylands as well as highlights the far-reaching importance of significant CO2 fertilization to greening dryland ecosystems despite increasing atmospheric and SW constraints.

Efficiently harnessing excess atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is crucial for closing the carbon cycle effectively. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECR) holds significant promise for producing valuable products and environmentally friendly chemicals. Carbon monoxide (CO) stands out as one of the most economically viable products of ECR.[1,2] While noble metals commonly catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion, alternative non-noble catalysts are essential for cost reduction. Molecular catalysts like cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) offer high ECR activity but limited stability (< 10 h).[3–5] Moreover, the production cost of porous transport layers (PTLs) significantly impacts ECR electrolyzer costs, with commercial carbon-PTLs adding a 20% increase.[6–8] Our work focuses on developing low-cost, non-woven cellulose-based porous PTLs for electrochemical CO 2 -to-CO conversion. By depositing a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) catalyst layer over our PTLs, we fabricated ECR-functioning gas-diffusion-electrodes (GDEs) for both flow-cell and zero-gap electrolyzers. Under optimal conditions, the Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE CO ) reached 92 % at a high current density of 200 mA cm −2 . Furthering the architecture of the GDEs, CoPc was incorporated into the initial PTL slurry, forming ECR-active PTLs without the need for an additional catalyst layer. The new GDE architecture favored the CoPc-distribution by enhancing the contact and interactions with the carbon substrate and demonstrated a stable electrolysis process for over 50 h in a zero-gap electrolyzer at 200 mA cm −2 with a FE CO of 80 %.[9] This study marks a substantial breakthrough in developing for the first time, paper-based functionalized PTLs for the ECR. Marking a significant contribution to the progression of the ECR into practical implications. [1] M. Jouny, W. Luc, F. Jiao, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 57 (2018) 2165–2177. [2] G.O. Larrazábal, A.J.

The rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) holds promise as an energy storage system for the next generation due to its high theoretical energy density, safe aqueous electrolyte, environmental friendliness, and cost-effectiveness of zinc. However, the efficiency of ZABs is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Noble metals such as platinum (Pt), iridium dioxide (IrO 2 ), and ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) are commonly used as advanced electrocatalyst materials. Nonetheless, their scarcity, high cost, unstable catalytic properties, and susceptibility to carbon monoxide poisoning limit the large-scale applications of ZABs. Therefore, exploring non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs is crucial, with transition metals being viable alternatives. Recently, bimetallic transition metal layered double hydroxide (LDH) has emerged as a promising candidate for OER catalysts due to its high specific surface area, abundant active sites, and synergistic effects between two transition metals. However, LDH still faces challenges such as poor electrical conductivity and self-aggregation during fabrication. In this work, we developed a three-dimensional core-shell structure, enabling the growth of LDH on nitrogen-doped porous carbon framework (N-C) materials to address these challenges. The N-C material, derived from zeolitic-imidazole framework (ZIF) material after pyrolysis, shows promise as an ORR catalyst. ZIF, a subclass of metal-organic framework (MOF), boasts high nitrogen content and inherits MOF advantages such as a high surface area, abundant active sites, and chemical stability. Furthermore, utilizing mesoporous silica as a hard template allows us to maintain the dodecahedral structure of ZIF and create mesoporous structures after annealing. The core-shell structure developed in this study demonstrates superior OER and ORR catalytic activity, offering a promising direction for the design of bifunctional catalysts for high-performance ZABs.

Due to limited slip systems activated at room temperature, the plastic deformation of Mg and its alloys without any preheating of initial billets is significantly limited. To overcome those issues, new methods of severe plastic deformation are discovered and developed. One such example is extrusion with an oscillating die, called KoBo. This method, due to the oscillations of reversible die located at the end of extruded, introduces material into the plastic flow, and thus, enables deformation without preheating of the initial billets of metals that are hard to deform. Such solution is important from an industrial point of view and may lead to serious savings and reduction in carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere. Therefore, this paper focuses on the possibility of KoBo extrusion of hcp-structured Mg alloys with different chemical compositions and includes comparison of their corrosion resistance using short-term electrochemical tests. In order to have a broad view of the problem presented, we compared the electrochemical behavior of the following groups of Mg materials: pure Mg, Mg-Al-Zn, Mg-Li, and Mg-Y-RE. It was stated that the KoBo method performed at room temperature improves the corrosion resistance of pure Mg when compared to the initial billet and the alloys which belong to the Mg-Al-Zn, Mg-Li, and Mg-Y-RE series. The presented study shows that different corrosion trends are observed for traditionally deformed alloys, and they significantly vary from nascent developments, such as KoBo extrusion. Therefore, it is crucial to widely study those methods because it may be a path leading to long-lasting solution to the formability limitations of Mg-based metallic systems.

Electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is known to proceed at lower overpotentials with the presence of ionic liquids (ILs) in the electrolyte. However, the role of ILs in modulating CO 2 RR, even for the most studied 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF 4 ]) remains unclear. In this study, the electric field and the hydrogen bonding effects induced by [EMIM][BF 4 ] and hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), including water and a series of alcohols, in acetonitrile were examined on Ag. By employing voltammetry, in-situ enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that the initial electron transfer to CO 2 occurs at reduced overpotentials when it is confined between the [EMIM] + ring planes and the electrode surface. This confinement of CO 2 stabilizes it at the interface and enables its conversion to CO, accompanied by the generation of carbene and water as by-products. Furthermore, our findings suggest water (< 0.5 M) acts as the hydrogen bond donor as opposed to serving as the primary source of free protons. Based on this finding, we further show how the extend of hydrogen bonding as varied by various alcohols alter the microenvironment in synergy with [EMIM] + at the electrode-electrolyte interface for fine tuning of the thermodynamics of CO 2 RR. The clarified role of the imidazolium based ILs and hydrogen bond donors, and the demonstrated enhancement in CO 2 RR will advance non-aqueous electrolyte development and inform future kinetic studies.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) holds promise for carbon capture and utilization (CCU), aiming to produce carbon-neutral fuels and valuable chemical intermediates. Copper (Cu) is recognized as the primary metallic catalyst facilitating C-C coupling reactions to yield multi-carbon compounds. Many researchers have been developing Cu catalysts, such as oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu), and tandem catalysts to increase the kinetics of C-C coupling. The investigation of tandem catalysts, especially those derived from oxides of copper (OD-Cu), has been conducted to improve selectivity towards multi-carbon compounds like ethylene and ethanol. Nonetheless, the effect of the loading structure of the CO-producing catalyst within the tandem catalyst on CO 2 RR performance has not been fully explored. In this study, we synthesized Au nanoparticles with different sizes and loading densities on Cu 2 O through the galvanic replacement reaction and examined their influence on CO 2 RR properties. Tandem catalysts containing smaller Au nanoparticles demonstrated heightened activity in the electrochemical CO 2 RR, leading to an anodic shift in potential. Additionally, tandem catalysts with smaller Au nanoparticles exhibited improved Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and partial current densities (PCDs) for C 2+ compounds. The tandem catalysts with larger Au nanoparticles also showed better CO 2 RR performance than the original OD-Cu; however, it was found that CO 2 RR results of the tandem catalysts with a small size of Au nanoparticles were superior to those with large size of Au nanoparticles. Interestingly, the FEs and PCDs of n-propanol, a C 3 product, increased as the coverage of Au nanoparticles increased. This behavior contrasts with the case of ethylene and ethanol. The maximum Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of these C 2 products from tandem catalysts did not exceed those from OD-Cu. The effectiveness of the tandem effect relies on the localized concentration of CO, heightened by the CO-producing catalyst situated on the confined OD-Cu surface. The improvement of the selectivity towards the C 3 product may come from the interface between the Au nanoparticles and OD-Cu, where the C 1 -C 2 coupling reaction is favorable. We utilized a Nickel single-atom catalyst (Ni-SAC) to create a high local concentration of CO within the catalyst layer. Despite this, we did not observe any tandem effect. This suggests that the proximity between CO active sites and C 2+ active sites plays a crucial role in triggering the CO spillover effect. Our results shed light on a strategy for constructing efficient tandem structures in CO 2 RR.

Manganese dioxide has garnered significant attention as a promising catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media due to its excellent catalytic activity, low cost, durability, and scalability. Despite its promising catalytic activity, MnO 2 suffers from limitations such as low conductivity, particle dissolution, and diminished mass transport properties, particularly in high-throughput environments. Researchers typically couple MnO 2 with high conductivity and high surface area materials such as conductive carbon black to overcome these challenges. However, this method still presents challenges, such as diminished catalyst-carbon interactions and the loss of catalytic active sites by the surrounding of larger carbon particles. In this study, we present a two-step synthesis method, initially proposed for the application of MnO 2 as supercapacitor materials 1 , for the improvement of MnO 2 catalytic activity towards the ORR. This synthesis method was achieved using diazonium chemistry, which involves the direct chemical attachment of KJB carbon black with MnO 2 via a phenyl group linkage site. This process was done so that the mass ratio of MnO2 and KJB was 50:50. The synthesized materials were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm varying morphologies, particle sizes, and material compositions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were utilized to analyze the phases and crystallinities of the materials. Each characterization step was done before and after the chemical attachment process to ensure the modifications were performed. The electrochemical activity of the materials was investigated using three-electrode cells to study the ORR activities and stabilities of the synthesized materials. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) data were employed to analyze kinetic current densities, the number of electrons transferred, and the hydrogen peroxide production rates. Furthermore, the catalyst materials were implemented into aluminum-air battery configurations where polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and multistep chronoamperometry experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the modified MnO 2 catalyst materials. Overall, implementing this process led to substantial increases in the catalytic activities morphologically dependent MnO 2 particles towards the ORR and highlighted the significance of this research in advancing the understanding and application of MnO 2 catalysts in energy conversion and storage technologies.

Abstract Electric vehicle (EV) deployment provides an opportunity to reduce emissions in Texas, which has the greatest transportation emissions in the United States. This study aims to evaluate the impact of light-duty EV (LDEV) adoption through a capacity expansion model of the Texas power grid (Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT). Particularly, this work investigates how various LDEV adoption rates and charging strategies (i.e., managed and unmanaged) affect the electricity generation capacity mix, hourly dispatch, transmission capacity, carbon emissions, and costs in ERCOT. Our findings show that unmanaged charging strategies can lead to 30%–70% cumulative tailpipe CO2 emission reductions in the power and transportation sectors by 2050, depending on whether the LDEV adoption is 50% or 100%, respectively. These CO2 reductions are associated with 2.5%–6.7% increases in total power system costs compared to a scenario with no EV adoption. Furthermore, we find that managed charging can lead to 10% less transmission capacity compared to unmanaged charging in the complete LDV electrification scenarios. These results indicate that policies incentivizing EV adoption and managed charging strategies can facilitate sustainable decarbonization in the transportation sector while minimally increasing costs relative to a scenario without increased EV adoption.

Transcritical refrigeration systems using natural refrigerants like CO2 operate on the ejector–expansion cycle to achieve high operating efficiency. The variability of ejector geometry dictates the adjustability of refrigerating capacity in such systems. Traditional spindle-controlled axial-flow ejectors significantly obstruct the high-pressure motive flow to regulate mass flow rate by controlling flow area. This study introduces the first radial-flow ejector geometry for transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems, designed to operate at high mass flow rates and entrainment ratios with minimal obstruction to motive flow. The study numerically investigates the performance of a radial-flow two-phase ejector for CO2, comparing it with an axial-flow ejector of similar dimensions under the same conditions. It explores the impact of applied compression ratio, motive nozzle throat spacing, and other geometries on radial ejector performance. An increase in the motive throat spacing improves the range of operable discharge pressures and achievable compression ratios, with a slight reduction in the secondary flow entrainment. A nozzle throat spacing of 0.6 mm allows a wider range of operable discharge pressures, and beyond this, the operable discharge pressure range drops. The addition of a diffuser section of sufficient length also improves the flow entrainment in the radial ejector. The radial ejector allows substantially high mass flow rates of even 15 times that of the axial ejector. This high mass flow capacity in the radial configuration can significantly compact ejector designs for large-capacity transcritical CO2 refrigeration and air-conditioning systems.

Transition metal single-atom catalysts supported on N-doped graphene (M-N-Cs) offer significant advantages in metal utilization and uniformity of active sites compared to traditional heterogeneous catalysts. They are particularly notable for their superior electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) performance. Various modifications have been explored, including different metal combinations, different first shell elements (N, C, S, B), and coordination numbers, to enhance electrocatalytic ORR activities. Another emerging focus is the link between their local structure and spin state. The Zhenan Bao and Jaramillo groups recently found that the catalytic activity of the NiN x moiety stems from its tetrahedrally distorted structure because it stabilizes the high-spin Ni state more than the low-spin state.[1] The local structure and its distortion can be modified by adjusting the carbon nanotube diameter,[2] pore size,[3] layering,[4] or by adding ligands at the first or second shell.[5] In this study, we have conducted a computational screening of M-N-Cs with 3d, 4d, and 5d metals and local structures including square planar, tetragonal pyramidal, and tetrahedral symmetries. Metals in their divalent states within the MN 4 units exhibited a V-shaped trend in formation energy correlated with increasing atomic numbers across each series. This pattern appears to be linked to the interaction between the two electrons of the N 4 ligand and the d electron count of the metals, and it also emerged in the *O/*OH adsorption energy plots. Additionally, the preferred spin state varied with the metal type and structural symmetry, influencing electron distribution and crystal field splitting. These factors collectively impacted the binding energies with adsorbents, subsequently altering oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Further, we explored the adsorption energies of various intermediates (*CO, *H, *Cl, and *N 2 H) relevant to carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), chlorine evolution reaction (ClER), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), respectively. Our primary objective was to identify optimal metal-structure combinations for enhanced catalytic performance. To achieve this, we considered several descriptors including partial Integrated Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (ICOHP), metal d-band center, Madelung energy, and metal ionization potential. Moving forward, we aim to extend these findings by incorporating distorted coordination environments and integrating experimental synthesis strategies to induce such distortions, potentially unlocking new pathways for catalytic efficiency enhancement.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction (ECR) is a promising approach for enabling the conversion of greenhouse gas CO 2 into valuable products with electricity from renewable sources to achieve net-zero CO 2 emission. ECR simultaneously reduces carbon emissions and dependence on fossil-based fuels and chemicals. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), which often comprise an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and a precious iridium oxide (IrO x )-based anode, have been extensively studied in the last few years. However, challenges such as salt precipitation on cathodic gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), high cell voltage and the need to use noble metal anodes have hindered ECR's practical applications. Herein, we introduce a new design of MEA cells using a low-cost hydrophilic film separator and a Nickel (Ni) foam instead of AEM and IrO x , respectively. Hydrophilic separator material with high water permeability lowers the full-cell voltage and eliminates the salt accumulation on the GDE in both alkaline and neutral-pH conditions. Using copper-sputtered polytetrafluoroethylene (Cu/PTFE) as cathodes, we demonstrated a stable conversion of CO 2 to ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) at current densities over 100 mA/cm 2 . In neutral-pH anolyte, the average C 2 H 4 FE was sustained at around 50% for more than 200 hours with a cell voltage of 3.1 V at the current density of 110 mA/cm 2 . Under alkaline conditions, this system showed 500 hours of stability of CO 2 -to-C 2 H 4 conversion: the C 2 H 4 FE was maintained above 60% with the cell voltage of only 2.2 V at 110 mA/cm 2 current density. Our research provides a solution for achieving stable ECR operation at a relatively high current density using Earth-abundant materials. This work opens opportunities for energy-efficient and stable CO 2 conversion without needing expensive and rare elements, which are crucial for practical applications.

Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2R) is a promising route to enable a circular economy for production of carbon-based materials using non-fossil-based feed stocks. Copper catalysts have been shown to be proficient at converting CO 2 to ethylene as a precursor to polymer-based material synthesis. Production of ethylene at high faradaic efficiency and low voltage is necessary for commercial-scale viability of eCO2R as a technology, but the current state of the art does not meet these key performance indicators. We have synthesized and characterized quaternary ammonia-based polyphenylene oxide (QPPO) ionomers as alternatives to commercially available ionomers, and the QPPO ionomers showed increased faradaic efficiency towards ethylene while also decreasing full cell voltage. In this presentation, we demonstrate how continuum modeling was used to identify that underlying cause for achieving higher ethylene faradaic efficiency and lower cell voltage was the prevention of flooding of the gas diffusion layer in a zero-gap CO 2 electrolyzer. We simulated two cell assemblies to elucidate the phenomena governing performance differences: one with a bare copper catalyst between the gas diffusion medium and membrane, and the other with an ionomer layer between the catalyst layer and the membrane. To validate our full cell model against experimental results for each cell assembly, we introduced a flooded region of the cathode diffusion media. By fitting the thickness of the flooded region, we were able to capture all trends for cell voltage and faradaic efficiency toward four products over three applied current densities. Voltage breakdown analysis showed that the ~150 mV lower cell voltage with the addition of the ionomer layer resulted from decreased charge and mass transfer overpotentials at the cathode due to the high aqueous CO 2 concentration in the cathode catalyst layer and decrease in CO 2 consumption to bicarbonate via the presence of liquid water in the gas diffusion layer. Overall, these results show the importance of incorporating liquid water into accurate modeling of CO 2 electrolyzers and water management in experimental work to achieve commercial-scale electrolyzer performance.

CO 2 emissions have become a series problem since the industrial revolution, the detrimental effect of CO 2 emissions raise people’s awareness in recent years. Scientists are eagerly searching the sustainable energy as the replacement of the petrochemical industry. The carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) can reduce the CO 2 amount in the atmosphere as well as generating the valuable carbon-based chemicals spontaneously, which is a strong potential way for the next generation green energy. In our work, we suggested a strategical design of the copper cathode in the zero-gap membrane electrolyte assembly (MEA) electrolyzer of CO 2 RR, the electrolyte-free cathodic environment caused the consequence of inefficient and ineffective activation. The magnesium oxide (MgO) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2 ) incorporated with the copper oxide (CuO) as the initial catalyst (CuO-MgO/Mg(OH) 2 ), with the manipulation of three gradually increasing potential range of cyclic voltammetry (CV) as the break-in process, the MgO/(OH) 2 totally dissolved when contacting the located CO 2 (g) and H 2 O (l) crossed from the anode which brought by the cation through the electric field attraction. The absent of the dissolved MgO/Mg(OH) 2 would provide the sufficient triple-phase boundary, with the accessible reactant CO 2 (g) and H 2 O (l) and proper local environment, the high surface area copper (HSA-Cu) eventually creating a proper condition for CO 2 RR. The high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) 276 μC/cm 2 and 11.3 mF/cm 2 had been proved in the monolayer copper oxidation redox detection and capacitance double layer (C dl ) measurement, respectively. The HSA-Cu had outstanding performance of the partial current density j C2H4 = 44.7 mA/cm 2 at 3.0 V and Faradaic efficiency FE C2H4 = 27.3 % at 2.8 V for C 2 H 4 product. A 4-fold j C2H4 and 2.5-fold FE C2H4 improvement compared with nano Cu, in equal voltage applied.

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has been widely acknowledged as a key component in the global transition from fossil energy to renewable energy powered society to combat climate change. Cu is the only metal capable of converting CO 2 to valuable multicarbon products with decent yields. Despite intense research efforts, mechanistic understanding of Cu-catalyzed CO 2 RR remains incomplete. A key point with impactions for catalyst design is whether the CO 2 -to-CO conversion and the further conversion of CO are independent steps in the reaction network of the CO 2 RR. In this talk, I will discuss our recent results showing that the presence of CO 2 enhances the Cu-catalyzed CORR to multicarbon products, and intriguingly, not by acting as an additional surface of carbon. Co-electrolysis studies show that there are at least two types of Cu sites with distinct activities, with one type favoring the CO 2 -to-CO conversion (Cu CO2 ), and the other more active in the CORR (Cu CO ). Analysis based a proposed two-site model shows that CO adsorbed on Cu CO is at least six times more active in the formation of multicarbon products than that on Cu CO2 . Experiments conducted on single crystal Cu facets suggest that Cu CO2 corresponds to Cu(111)-like sites and Cu CO is associated with undercoordinated Cu sites.

Following the economic shocks of recent decades, characterized by the destabilization of markets and pressure on national economies, protectionist policies have seen a significant increase. Thus, anti-dumping has become a convenient and frequently used tool in the political game of trade. In the context of the transition toward a climate-neutral economy, anti-dumping measures have become a topic of great interest due to their indirect effects on CO2 emissions. Often used to protect domestic industries from unfair trade practices, these measures influence trade and the geographical redistribution of production, contributing to the phenomenon of “carbon leakage”. By transferring emissions from countries with strict climate regulations to economies with more permissive standards, anti-dumping measures can undermine global efforts to reduce emissions. Trade policies are becoming, in this context, an important tool in regulating international trade. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to analyze the impacts of anti-dumping measures, primary energy consumption, and urbanization on CO2 emissions in OECD countries for the period 2000–2021. The methodology used is based on dynamic A.R.D.L. models using panel data. Our results suggest that anti-dumping measures and primary energy consumption influence CO2 emissions and are statistically significant, at least at the 10% level. The results of this study are useful to both policymakers and environmental authorities in developing trade policies that support both economic development and emission-reduction targets.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is attracting technology because it can convert CO 2 into a useful resource with zero emissions by using surplus electricity and renewable energy. For achieving efficient electrolysis of CO 2 , the development of a high performance electrocatalysts is required. Copper (Cu) is the only metal that is capable of electrochemically converting CO 2 to hydrocarbons, but the high overpotential of hydrocarbon formation and the low selectivity of the reduction products have been problems. One of the solutions to these problems is the hybridization of metal and organic materials, in which the metal serves as the CO 2 reduction reaction sites and the organic material stabilizes the intermediates [1]. In this study, we have electrodeposited Cu with five different types of amino acids which is expecting stabilization of CO 2 reductive intermediates and evaluated its catalytic activity of electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . The electrodeposited Cu with amino acids was obtained by a constant current electrolysis at -2.0 mA cm -2 for 1.0 C cm -2 from the aqueous solutions containing 10 mmol dm -3 CuSO 4 ･5H 2 O, 0.1 mol dm -3 Na 2 SO 4 , and 1.0 mmol dm -3 amino acids in a three-electrode cell with carbon paper (CP) as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The pH of electrolytic bath was fixed at 1.10 by adding H 2 SO 4 . The obtained electrodeposited Cu samples were characterized by Raman measurement, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 has been conducted by a constant potential electrolysis at -1.27 V vs. RHE of 0.5 mol dm -3 KHCO 3 aqueous solutions saturated with CO 2 . The amount of reductive gas products was quantified by gas chromatograph- mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and gas chromatograph thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD). The chronopotentiograms obtained during the electrodeposition of Cu, both in the presence and absence of 1.0 mmol dm −3 of the various amino acids showed different potential required to reach a current of −4.0 mA depending on the amino acids. However, considering the result of the open-circuit-potential measurement, the amino acids do not form complexes with Cu 2+ , suggesting that the electrolysis species remain consistent regardless of the amino acid present in the Cu electrodeposition bath. Therefore, the differences observed in the chronopotentiograms during Cu electrodeposition are attributed to the adsorption of amino acids on the electrodeposited Cu. The adsorption of amino acids on electrodeposited Cu was confirmed by Raman spectra and EDS spectra obtained from cross-sectional HAADF-STEM images. The peak of Raman spectra originating from amino acids was observed from electrodeposited Cu when Cu electrodeposition was conducted with amino acids, confirming the higher ratio of N and Cu on the surface compared to within the particle in the EDS spectra. Surface morphologies were observed by using SEM. CP has fiber-like structure but electrodeposited Cu without and with amino acids were deposited such coating CP fiber. The particle size of electrodeposited Cu with amino acids was more homogeneous, and the particles were more densely packed together than pure electrodeposited Cu. However, changing diffraction patterns and peak broadening due to loading amino acids in XRD were not observed. The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 on electrodeposited Cu samples was performed and the faradic efficiency (FE) of the CO 2 reduction gas products were calculated. All electrodeposited Cu with and without amino acids showed a higher FE for the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 compared to Cu foil (24.2%) and different values depending on amino acids. In particular, electrodeposited with L-histidine containing imidazole groups showed a high FE of 67.6%, effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. This finding highlights the important role of functional groups in amino acids, especially imidazole, in facilitating the electrochemical conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 . This study shows that certain functional groups in amino acids have a crucial influence on the catalytic efficiency of electrodeposited Cu in CO 2 reduction reaction applications. [1] S.

Reactive capture - the integration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and upgrade - bypasses the energy-intensive CO 2 regeneration step and thereby offers potential to reduce both capital and energy costs. Alkali hydroxide solutions are a common type of capture solution for reactive capture, wherein CO 2 is chemically absorbed in the form of carbonate and/or bicarbonate. The composition and pH of the post-capture solution depend on the CO 2 concentration of the CO 2 source used and the capture duration. Lower pH levels yield higher bicarbonate concentrations, facilitating greater CO 2 release during the reactive capture step and resulting in enhanced electrolysis performance. For example, direct electrochemical reduction of a pure carbonate solution (pH~12.2) has a theoretical carbon monoxide (CO) Faradaic efficiency (FE) cap at 50%, but no cap exists for a pure bicarbonate solution (pH~8.2), leading to better electrolysis performance and lower operating expenditures (OPEX) for the capture and conversion cycle. However, achieving a low pH post-capture solution with higher bicarbonate content slows the capture rate, necessitating either a bigger contactor or longer capture time, thereby increasing capital expenditures (CAPEX) for the capture step. Using a silver catalyst, we report here the electrolysis energy efficiency (EE) of CO 2 to CO using a 2M potassium hydroxide solution with a post-capture pH ranging from 13.5 (hydroxide and carbonate mix) to 8.2 (pure bicarbonate). We conducted a technical-economic analysis (TEA) to assess the CAPEX and OPEX of an industrial-scale reactive capture plant that captures both point source (10%) and atmospheric (420 ppm) CO 2 using 2M potassium hydroxide with different post-capture pH values. The TEA includes a sensitivity analysis to account for improvements in electrolysis performance and reduced costs due to technological advancement and economies of scale in the future. Our results demonstrate that there is an optimal post-capture pH for potassium hydroxide-based reactive capture that balances the capture cost and electrolysis performance. This study serves as a guideline for choosing an industrial relevant pH to work with for future hydroxide-based reactive capture research.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) opened new opportunities for rapid development of modern portable devices. LIBs use mainly the intercalation cathodes represented by transition metal oxides and phosphates as cathodes, which are incapable of fulfilling the requirements of electric vehicles and high energy storage systems due to their limited energy density (less than 400 W h kg -1 ). Moreover, intercalation type cathodes have several drawbacks associated with high cost of materials and safety issues which also limit their use in electric vehicles and large-scale power systems. Therefore, implementation of alternative systems with higher specific capacity, energy density and inexpensive sources is required to meet high demands. In this regard, lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy systems due to high theoretical specific capacity, which results in a theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg −1 [1]. Moreover, sulfur has low cost, considerably less environmentally impact and abundant resources [2]. However, the implementation of Li-S batteries is hindered due to several drawbacks such as low conductivity of sulfur, complicated redox reactions, shuttle of soluble intermediates (polysulfides, LiPS), dendrite growth on lithium anode and volumetric expansion of cathode upon reduction to Li2S2/Li2S which leads to structural degradation and lower the cycle life of batteries [3]. The shuttle effect can be suppressed via encapsulation of sulfur into carbon matrices, synthesis of conductive sulfur composites with polymers, etc. In our recent works we reported on carbon materials with metal -oxides, -sulfides and -nitrides as sulfur immobilizers exhibiting strong affinity to LiPSs. Despite such strong immobilization effect of metal compounds, the conversion of sulfur to the end products needs to be enhanced by introduction of electrocatalysts. In this work, the synergistic effect of heterostructures with double functions, titanium dioxide as LiPSs immobilizer with Ni nanoparticles as electrocatalysts were prepared and analyzed as an effective sulfur host material. The present study focuses on the implementation of composite compounds with dual effects on the performance enhancement of Li-S batteries.

In recent years, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) have attracted attention as an important technology for achieving carbon neutral society due to high energy efficiency without carbon dioxide emission during power generation. In order to cost reduction of PEMFC, the use of cheaper structural materials, such as stainless steels, that possess excellent processability, has been studied in substitution for titanium for bipolar plate (separator). The practical environment in PEMFC is severely corrosive: high temperature, acidic, and fluoride-containing solution. Many study has been conducted on the development of materials that have sufficient corrosion resistance and low contact resistance enabling long-term durability even in such severe environment. However, present evaluation method is insufficient for diagnosis the lifetime of bipolar plate. The new evaluation technique, that accurately simulates the environment inside PEMFC and appropriately accelerates the corrosion degradation reaction, make it easier to predict the lifetime of products and precisely evaluate the performance of newly developed materials. Therefore, the purpose of this study is development of novel corrosion evaluation method with high reproducibility, high and rapid diagnosis performance via applying various electrochemical measurements simulating PEMFC environment and for elucidation the corrosion behavior in practical environment. Firstly, several common corrosion resistance tests were performed in a specific solution (80 ℃, pH3, 10ppm Cl-, 3ppm F-) that simulated the internal environment of PEMFC. As a result, potentiostatic polarization (0.724 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 24 h) showed poor reproducibility because the corrosion behavior in later stage depends largely on the occurrence of localized corrosion initial stage of the test. In the case of potentiodynamic polarization(+1 mV/s sweep from open-circuit potential), risk of localized corrosion could be investigated, however, it was not suitable to predict long-term corrosion behavior. In the case of potentiodynamic cyclic polarization (cyclic voltammetry), it was found that the cathodic sweep, which never occur at in-sever PEMFC condition, inhibited the stable growth of the passivation film on the steel surface by reduction reaction, resulting in improperly accelerated excessive corrosion. Then, new testing method of the intermittent polarization, which was a combination of potentiostatic polarization and open-circuit condition, was performed. It has the advantage in flexibility of testing conditions such as polarization potential and duty cycle in accordance with to the degree the corrosion acceleration. In fact, it was found that the localized corrosion caused by initial stage of potentiostatic polarization step was repassivated during the following open circuit step. Therefore, the reproducibility was improved and the passive film growth was properly evaluated by intermittent polarization test, therefore. It was expected to be promising technique to diagnose the long-term durability of PEMFC bipolar plate. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the intermittent potentiostatic polarization method, a variety of type 304 stainless steel specimens with different corrosion resistance were used. The detailed results will be presented on the relevant session.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of sunlight into a chemical energy of hydrogen (H 2 ) through water splitting has been studied extensively to achieve production of storable and transportable energy sources from sunlight. Reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) using water (H 2 O) as an electron source into a more reduced chemical species is also an important subject for utilization of solar energy because of its possible production of energy-rich carbonaceous compounds without the use of fossil resources. Among the various possible systems, a coupling of two different semiconductor electrodes termed a Z-scheme system has been studied as an attractive concept in recent years. For the photocathode side in the Z-scheme system, Cu-based selenides and sulfides and their mixed forms of selenosulfides crystallized in chalcopyrite and kesterite structures, which were originally used as photovoltaic materials, were shown to be effective upon modifications on their surfaces for inducing water reduction. A ternary chalcopyrite CuGaSe 2 is one of the attractive materials for this application because of its wide bandgap energy (1.67 eV) for achieving a positive onset potential for water reduction. However, compared to other narrow-gap chalcopyrite- and kesterite-based systems such as CIGS (Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 , a marked improvement of PEC performance over the CuGaSe 2 -based photocathode has not been achieved. In this study, PEC activity for water reduction (H 2 liberation) over a co-evaporated CuGaSe 2 compact thin film modified with a CdS layer and Pt deposits under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) radiation was evaluated, specifically focusing on the impact of a Cu-deficient layer (CDL) loaded on the top part of the CuGaSe 2 film. It was found that the intentional loading of the CDL with an appropriate thickness was effective for achieving a large current flow and relatively positive photocurrent onset. The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) reached 6.6% over the best photocathode used. Moreover, the highest photocurrent onset potential of more than 0.9 V vs. RHE was achieved over the photocathode based on the CuGaSe 2 film having an extremely thick CDL (200 nm) with a relatively thick CdS layer (90 nm) due to efficient spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, though the thick CDL was also detrimental for efficient photoabsorption of CuGaSe 2 , resulting in appreciable decrease in photocurrent densities when compared to those obtained over photocathodes based on CuGaSe 2 films covered with a relatively thin CDL. Furthermore, an appreciable increase in current density was observed by applying intentional doping of rubidium (Rb), leading to the best STH of 8%. Although further investigation is required, increase in porosity at the heterointerface induced by the Rh doping would contribute for the result. Therefore, regulation of properties at the p-n heterointerface should be important for designing chalcopyrite- photocathodes for further improvements of PEC parameters of water reduction. The concept would also be applicable for preparations of the other PEC devices aiming for water oxidation as well as CO 2 reduction.

Photoelectrochemical biohybrids combine the advantages of light harvesting semiconductors and biocatalysts into a single compact device. However, limited device stability, the use of toxic elements and non-innocent external components (buffers, mediators or sacrificial reagents) makes a sustainable artificial photosynthetic reaction, where fuel production is coupled to water oxidation, difficult to achieve. Here, we introduce organic photoelectrodes connected to an inverse opal TiO2 matrix that hosts efficient hydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase, driving direct solar fuel synthesis. By co-immobilising carbonic anhydrase, supported by simulations and spectroscopic investigations, the PCE10:EH-IDTBR photobiocathodes generate unprecedented photocurrent densities of up to −8 mA cm−2 in a pH neutral bicarbonate solution, attaining stable H2 production or selective CO2-to-formate conversion over 10 h. Semi-artificial photosynthesis is achieved by assembling the photobiocathode with a BiVO4 photoanode in an artificial leaf device for unassisted CO2 reduction coupled to O2 evolution, attaining a faradaic yield of 87% over 24 h of operation.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 has the potential to convert CO 2 into carbon-based fuels by using renewable energy. For many years, copper based cathodes have been highlighted as the quintessential electrocatalytic surface for CO 2 reduction (exemplified by the work of Hori). While gas-diffusion electrodes have shown than industrially relevant reaction rates can be achieved using relatively simple cathode materials, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the behaviour of copper cathodes in aqueous solutions. In particular, a review of the literature reveals that a very wide range of product selectivities are found at seemingly similar conditions (Figure 1). Rather surprisingly this review shows that sometimes copper can have almost no activity for CO 2 reduction and instead evolve almost pure H 2 . Our own measurements confirm this unexpected behaviour, with replicate experiments revealing occasions where identically mechanically polished copper electrodes favour hydrogen evolution over CO 2 reduction. In this presentation, we will discuss the reproducibility of CO2 reduction and the steps taken to explain copper’s highly variable product selectivity.

Electrochemical reduction of CO 2 is a promising method for converting a greenhouse gas into value-added products, utilizing renewable energy. Novel catalysts, electrode assemblies, and cell configurations are all necessary to achieve economically appealing performance. In this talk, I am going to present a zero gap electrolyzer cell, which converts gas phase CO 2 to products without the need for any liquid catholyte. I will demonstrate how multiple cells are connected into a stack, thus scaling up the electrolysis process. I will show how proper cell components and operational conditions result in industrially relevant performance. I will demonstrate the role of each component of the membrane electrode assembly, such as the catalysts, the porous transport layers, the membrane, and the ionomers. In the second part of my talk, I will show that while precipitate formation in the cathode gas diffusion electrode is detrimental for the long-term stability, the presence of alkali metal cations at the cathode improves performance. To overcome this contradiction, I will present different approaches which help to extend the lifetime of the electrolyzer cell. I will also present a detailed electrolyte and water balance of the operational cell, to better understand the contributing factors to these phenomena. As an outlook, I will present a complex machine learning based approach, through which we aim to find the optimal operating conditions of such CO2 electrolyzer cells. Finally, I will share the most recent insights on our containerized prototype CO2 electrolyzer system, capable of processing 100 t CO2/year.

A major concern within modern society is the need to substitute the fossil fuels with more renewable sources of the energy. Chemical industry is one of major players in the field of the usage of the crude oil to produce more complex chemicals. Despite of being good source of carbon species, a dropping amount of the coal and oil is raising the questions for future solutions. Carbon dioxide can be promising and sustainable source of carbon, but its high C-O bond energy (806 kJmol -1 ) poses general problems in efficient utilization. The most common feedstock in chemical synthesis is the syngas, a mixture of H 2 and CO, which can be simply processed into more complex molecules like e.g., methanol, dimethyl ether, or methane. Highly inert CO 2 can be transformed into more valuable CO via, so called, Reverse Water-Gas Shift Reaction (RWGS). Even though there are couple proposed CO 2 activation mechanisms, and knowledge on the reaction is quite high, the common issue is still proper selection of the catalyst for the reaction. In the surface redox mechanism Cu metal is being oxidized by CO 2 to form Cu 2 O with the release of CO. After that, Cu + ions are getting reduced back to metallic copper using surrounding H 2 . Solid Oxide Cells can become good source of ‘green’ hydrogen and, at the same time, perform direct electrolysis or chemical reduction of CO 2 . High temperature, at which SOECs are working, is beneficial from the point of Faradaic efficiency and CO 2 conversion rate. Steam electrode of SOEC contains copious amount of nickel. It is also a well-known catalyst for many reactions, but in this case the electrodes are struggling under carbon-rich atmosphere. Therefore, an addition of different catalytic materials is needed. Commonly used are mixed catalytic heterogenous systems composed of Cu supported on oxide materials e.g., Fe x O y , MoO 3 , La 2 O 3 , and many more. In this study a series of catalysts for SOECs were fabricated based on the Cu-doped double perovskite structure able to exsolve intermixed Cu or Cu-Fe nanoparticles supported on the matrix lattice of La 0.3 Sr 1.7 Fe 1.5 Mo 0.5 O 6-σ denoted as LSFM. The usage of LSFM compound as a matrix for Cu exsolution was based on the idea that it already consists of the oxides, which are currently utilized as the catalysts in RWGS. On the other hand, quite high mixed ionic-electronic conductivity may lead to even more enhanced electrochemical activity of the compound. The samples with varying Cu dopant level (5-20 mol.%) were synthesized via modified Pechini method maintaining fixed Fe:Mo ratio. Selected powders were processed into inks and screenprinted onto Ni-YSZ electrode. During the startup procedure of the SOEC, the catalysts were activated and the exsolution of metallic nanoparticles occurred. The powders and catalytic layers were characterized using XRD, SEM, and XPS techniques in both oxidized and reduced states. Doped compounds were able to exsolve metallic nanoparticles with the coverage density and size depending on the initial Cu amount in the lattice and the temperature of the reduction. Additional Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation (TPR/TPO) tests were performed to better understand the formation mechanism of surficial nanoparticles. SOECs equipped with additional layer of LSFM-Cu on the fuel electrode were examined for the performance in coelectrolysis mode under flowing H 2 O-CO 2 with subsequent measurement of the outlet gases concentration using GC-MS. New layer altered the production of syngas concerning H 2 :CO ratio, yield, selectivity and conversion rates. The anchoring effect of the exsolution process causes higher integration of the nanoparticles compared to conventional catalysts produced via simple deposition and most likely limits the evaporation and surface diffusion of copper. LSFM-Cu can be promising material for increasing the efficiency of the SOECs.

Photoelectrocatalysis stands at the forefront of transformative advancements in the chemical industry, offering a path toward a more sustainable future. Harnessing abundant solar energy through semiconducting photoelectrodes, this approach drives redox reactions directly at the electrolyte interfaces, significantly reducing the required energy input and eliminating the need for toxic or costly homogeneous catalysts. Beyond water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, the applicabilities of photoelectrocatalysis have been expanded to biomass upgrading and synthetic chemistry over the last ten years. In this work, we focus on the selective conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in acetonitrile, excluding the formation of benzoic acid, employing indirect photoelectrocatalysis with bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) as a photoanode, achieving nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. Notably, our investigation reveals the emergence of surface states formed between BiVO 4 and the redox mediator, N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS), resulting in a gradual decline in photocurrent density over time. Small perturbation techniques, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, were utilized for probing into the carrier dynamics at the electrolyte interface. In addition to blocking charge transfer sites of BiVO 4 , adsorption of NHS radicals also facilitates charge recombination on the photoelectrode surface. In addressing this issue, we present evidence that the density of these surface states can be effectively suppressed through optimized photoelectrode deposition methods as well as dopant incorporation. The roles of electrolytes and trace water impurities were also systematically analyzed. Our findings underscore the critical importance of understanding the chemical and dynamic landscapes at the semiconductor-electrolyte junction for unlocking the full potential of photoelectrocatalysis. This work sheds light on the intricacies of the photoelectrocatalytic processes and offers valuable insights for advancing the field and directing energy flow toward target molecular transformations with unique product selectivity.

The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to C 2 products is believed to proceed via the formation of adsorbed CO as an intermediate. Although ethylene is frequently reported as the main product when using Cu electrocatalysts, recent studies have demonstrated that directly feeding CO can result in the selective formation of acetate. In this study, we investigate the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 and CO using Cu electrocatalysts prepared by a one-pot synthesis method employing hydrazine as a reducing agent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent in a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) cell configuration. We investigated the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 and CO using Cu electrocatalysts prepared by a one-pot synthesis method in a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) cell configuration. While CO2 reduction primarily yields ethylene (36.99%), followed by hydrogen, CO, and ethanol, feeding CO directly under the same potential increases the total C 2 product yield from 52% to 83%, with acetate becoming the dominant product at 63%. Employing a phosphate buffer to maintain an alkaline pH of 8 further enhances acetate selectivity, reaching 90% with KOH. We propose a mechanism involving a common acetyl intermediate for ethylene formation from CO 2 and a ketene intermediate for CO reduction to acetate. Our results highlight the significant impact of feed, electrolyte composition, and pH on product distribution, with direct CO reduction favoring C 2 products and alkaline pH promoting acetate selectivity. These findings offer insights for optimizing the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 and CO. Figure 1

Underground research laboratories (URLs) provide a window on the deep biosphere and enable investigation of potential microbial impacts on nuclear waste, CO2 and H2 stored in the subsurface. We carried out the first multi-year study of groundwater microbiomes sampled from defined intervals between 140 and 400 m below the surface of the Horonobe and Mizunami URLs, Japan. We reconstructed draft genomes for > 90% of all organisms detected over a four year period. The Horonobe and Mizunami microbiomes are dissimilar, likely because the Mizunami URL is hosted in granitic rock and the Horonobe URL in sedimentary rock. Despite this, hydrogen metabolism, rubisco-based CO2 fixation, reduction of nitrogen compounds and sulfate reduction are well represented functions in microbiomes from both URLs, although methane metabolism is more prevalent at the organic- and CO2-rich Horonobe URL. High fluid flow zones and proximity to subsurface tunnels select for candidate phyla radiation bacteria in the Mizunami URL. We detected near-identical genotypes for approximately one third of all genomically defined organisms at multiple depths within the Horonobe URL. This cannot be explained by inactivity, as in situ growth was detected for some bacteria, albeit at slow rates. Given the current low hydraulic conductivity and groundwater compositional heterogeneity, ongoing inter-site strain dispersal seems unlikely. Alternatively, the Horonobe URL microbiome homogeneity may be explained by higher groundwater mobility during the last glacial period. Genotypically-defined species closely related to those detected in the URLs were identified in three other subsurface environments in the USA. Thus, dispersal rates between widely separated underground sites may be fast enough relative to mutation rates to have precluded substantial divergence in species composition. Species overlaps between subsurface locations on different continents constrain expectations regarding the scale of global subsurface biodiversity. Our analyses reveal microbiome stability in the sedimentary rocks and surprising microbial community compositional and genotypic overlap over sites separated by hundreds of meters of rock, potentially explained by dispersal via slow groundwater flow or during a prior hydrological regime. Overall, microbiome and geochemical stability over the study period has important implications for underground storage applications.

Abstract Electrocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and nitrate holds immense promise as a sustainable strategy, but its complicated synthesis steps and controversial C–N coupling mechanism restrict the design of efficient catalysts. Atomically precise metal cluster materials are ideal model catalysts for investigating the C–N coupling issues. Here we synthesize two atomically precise bimetallic clusters, Ag14Pd(PTFE)6(TPP)8 and Ag13Au5(PTFE)10(DPPP)4, both with icosahedral cores and similar ligands. We demonstrate that both clusters have good performance for electrocatalytic urea synthesis, with the production rates at the maximum Faradaic efficiency being 143.3 and 82.3 mg h−1 gcat−1, respectively. Bimetallic structures can induce charge polarization at the active sites of metal clusters, thereby influencing the selectivity. In mechanistic investigations, we propose that *NOH and *COOH are the rate-limiting steps for the reduction of nitrate and CO2, respectively, and that the key intermediates formed thereafter can significantly affect the C–N coupling process. This approach offers a deep understanding into the C–N coupling through the utilization of atomically precise metal clusters.

Polydispersed Ag species-modified TiO2 samples with abundant oxygen vacancies were successfully prepared through the calcination of atomically precise Ag33 nanocluster-loaded TiO2 at an optimal temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ligands of the Ag33 nanoclusters are removed by extracting lattice oxygen from TiO2 during the calcination, leading to the formation of CO2, SO2, and H2O vapor. This process simultaneously induces Ag species sintering on the surface of TiO2. The resulting nanocomposites exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of nitroarenes with NaBH4 as the reductant. This is attributed to the produced Ag species on the oxygen-deficient TiO2, which act as active centers for the catalytic process.

Background:Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to acne is a common undesirable sequela following acne that leads to psychological distress and a sense of incomplete treatment among the patients with acne. Few studies have been done in regard to address this condition, and no definite treatment or clear ranking of treatment modalities is available as of yet.Aims:The aim of our study was to assess and compare the efficacy and safety of 1,064-nm Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (QSNY) laser with 10% azelaic acid versus Fractional carbon dioxide (FCO2) laser with 10% azelaic acid in the treatment of post acne pigmentation.Materials and Methods:Seventy patients with PIH secondary to acne were recruited in this study. The patients were randomized into two groups, Group A and Group B, of thirty-five patients each. Patients in group A underwent QSNY laser, while Group B received FCO2 laser. 10% azelaic acid cream was administered to both groups. Both groups received a total of 5 treatment sessions, with 3 weeks interval between each setting. The efficacy and safety of both modalities were assessed using the quartile grading score(QGS), post acne hyperpigmentationindex(PAHPI), patient satisfaction score, and documentation of adverse effects.Results:At the end of five sessions, significant improvement in QGS, PAHPI and patient satisfaction (P < 0.001, respectively) was seen in both groups. The mean PAHPI significantly reduced after the third setting and was followed by drastic reduction in the following settings. However, significantly superior results were noted in Group A with respect to all assessments. Side effects noted were mild and transient, except two patients of Group B who developed further pigmentation over the treatment areas.Conclusion:This study shows that both QSNY laser and FCO2 laser can be used to treat post-acne pigmentation; however, QSNY laser should be preferred with respect to efficacy and safety, especially in the Indian population, owing to the higher risk of pigmentation following FCO2 laser.    

    

## Modeling Hydrogen Crossover in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers with and without Recombination Catalyst Interlayers

Low-temperature proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are poised to undergo rapid expansion in the coming decades for clean hydrogen production. Hydrogen has been hailed as the ‘Swiss Army knife’ of decarbonization as it can help mitigate carbon dioxide emissions from ammonia production, metal refining, and heavy-duty vehicle transportation. Proliferation of clean hydrogen production necessitates large reductions in iridium loadings in the anode while also operating at higher current density values. The latter goal can be achieved by adopting thinner proton exchange membranes (PEMs), but the use of thinner membranes exacerbates hydrogen crossover – which leads to unacceptable levels of hydrogen in the anode effluent poising safety concerns (i.e., above the lower explosion limit of 4 vol% hydrogen in oxygen). Notably, the hydrogen content in the anode effluent is high when operating the PEMWE at low current density values (0.1 to 0.5 A cm -2 ). A PEMWE will sometimes throttle down and operate at low current density because of the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources which are used to power the electrolyzer. Recombination catalyst (RC) interlayers, located within the PEM, can consume hydrogen and mitigate the hydrogen concentration in the anode effluent. This Talk presents our continuum-level modeling approach for hydrogen crossover in PEMWEs with membranes containing RC interlayers. The model accurately captures the hydrogen content in the anode effluent as a function of the PEMWE current density, cathode back pressure, membrane thickness, anode backpressure, RC location, and RC loading. The modeling results, as well as experimental observations in the literature, suggest that RC interlayer effectiveness is limited by oxygen availability at the RC interlayer. The low oxygen concentration at the interlayer relative to hydrogen arises from the lower solubility of oxygen in hydrated PEMs and the lower diffusivity of oxygen in hydrated PEMs. The Talk concludes with future directions to improve the model as well as suggestions for future experiments to aid the accuracy of the model.

The electrification of the petrochemical industry will greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing of commodity chemicals; however, electrification on a global scale is only achievable using earth-abundant materials for electrocatalysis in place of state-of-the-art catalysts made from precious metals. A promising catalyst that has been used for industrial hydrodesulfurization and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, nitrate reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and oxygen evolution is Ni 2 P. Ni 2 P and other transition metal phosphides benefit from active site ensembles that moderate the binding of reaction intermediates, making them promising electrocatalysts for reactions beyond the ones listed, especially other hydrogenation reactions. However, Ni 2 P and other TMPs are susceptible to oxidation, which can lead to catalyst degradation and loss in certain conditions. Stability is an important part of catalysis; therefore, it is important to understand the degradation mechanism of Ni 2 P in order to mitigate corrosion, accurately predict surface reactivity, and prepare Ni 2 P for industrial electrocatalysis. Previous reports on Ni-P alloys found passivation regimes through anodic polarization but others saw complete dissolution at more oxidizing potentials. Bulk nickel phosphides have been shown to have a passivated surface, and characterization, often limited to ex-situ spectroscopy after the fact, has shown that the surface is composed of nickel hydroxides, phosphates, and oxyhydroxides. In the present work, operando Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and polarization are combined to understand the electrochemical degradation of Ni 2 P nanoparticles. Ni 2 P nanoparticles were synthesized by heating NiCl 2 and tris(diethylamino)phosphine in oleylamine and thermally annealed at 450 °C under 5% H 2 /95% N 2 . Transmission-mode Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy was conducted on benchtop spectrometers (easyXAFS) using a 3D-printed electrochemical cell designed for operando spectroscopy. Nanoparticles maximize surface to bulk atom ratio, which is beneficial both for electrocatalysis, less atoms are necessary to have the same number of active sites, and for X-ray absorption, spectra are more surface sensitive. The use of a benchtop spectrometer offers the flexibility to iterate on experiments on the fly and the power to acquire synchrotron quality data on a routine basis. Preliminary results in neutral phosphate buffered electrolyte indicate that Ni 2 P significantly oxidizes and dissolves at and beyond 0.8 V vs RHE which agrees with anodic polarization corrosion experiments. Ongoing work extends anodic polarization experiments to acidic and basic pH and probes the potentials at which oxidation is no longer reversible. We hypothesize that dissolution will be less severe with increased pH and reduction of oxidized species to Ni 2 P will no longer be possible after the onset of Ni dissolution.

It is known that metakaolin powder has proved to be a promising alternative concrete binder to Ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Portland cement production contributes about 8% to the global CO2 emission, which is detrimental to the environment and a major contributor to global warming. It is therefore pertinent to develop alternative costeffective and environmentally friendly cement materials. This study examines the performance of a Nigerian metakaolin-based powder as a sustainable material alternative to Portland cement. The Gwaram-Alkaleri Kaolin clay from Bauchi State, Nigeria, was calcined at 800°C for 3 hours as step prior to metakaolin formation. The powder specimens were characterized using XRF, moisture content, specific gravity, density, particle size distribution analysis and specific surface area techniques. Parametric analyses of the values of the specific gravity, density, particle size distribution and specific surface area were undertaken and comparisons and deductions made. The results revealed that Gwaram-Alkaleri metakaolin-powder can serve as a potential sustainable construction material for the Nigerian construction industry because of its availability, affordability, physical and chemical properties values, and significant reduction in CO2 emission, taking cognizance that the results positively indicate that it can be used as an alternative binding powder to cement in concrete and mortar production.

With an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere, greenhouse gas emissions must be mitigated to prevent further global warming. A promising technology to achieve this goal is the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . Thereby, CO 2 is converted to value-added chemicals using renewable electrical energy. Ethylene or ethanol are valuable C 2+ products, which may be synthesized with copper based catalysts. However, many studies lack control of temperature and CO 2 excess factors as well as the application of industrially relevant current densities above 200 mA cm -2 . Additionally, recent literature proposes benefits of pulsed operation as opposed to static operation. Pulsed operation employing gas diffusion electrodes at elevated current densities must be studied in more detail to assess the full potential of dynamic operation. This work demonstrates the continuous electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to C 2+ products at industrially relevant conditions. Current densities from 100 mA cm -2 to 400 mA cm -2 are applied to an electrochemical flow cell with a geometrical electrode area of 25 cm 2 . CuO nanoparticles were deposited on gas diffusion layers as catalyst via automated ultrasonic spray-coating. Throughout electrolysis experiments, constant electrolyte temperatures of 20 °C or 40 °C and constant CO 2 excess factors of 2 or 5 are maintained. In contrast to statically applied current, pulsed current experiments focus on enhanced CO 2 mass transfer to the catalyst layer. Throughout static electrolysis, an increase in Faradaic efficiency from 30 % to 60 % for C 2+ products is observed when the current density is increased from 100 mA cm -2 to 400 mA cm -2 . This is attributed to a more alkaline pH in the catalyst layer caused by high current densities which is favorable to produce C 2+ products. Furthermore, it was found that an electrolyte bulk temperature of 20 °C increases the Faradaic efficiency for C 2+ products compared to experiments conducted at 40 °C. We hypothesize that this is due to less intermediate desorption from the catalyst. Furthermore, the reduction of CO 2 excess leads to an increase in Faradaic efficiency for C 2+ products. The highest Faradaic efficiency to C 2+ products was found at 400 mA cm -2 with an electrolyte bulk temperature of 20 °C at a CO 2 excess factor of 2. Additionally, the influence of pulsed current on the yield of C 2+ products was investigated and different pulsing procedures were tested. The results show that pulsed current operation reduces the parasitic hydrogen evolution. However, the C 2+ formation was not increased compared to static operation in an electrochemical flow cell at high current densities. In summary, this work shows how different process parameters influence the product distribution in electrochemical CO 2 reduction on a CuO catalyst to improve the selectivity towards C 2+ products. This is a further step towards a sustainable process to produce platform chemicals.    

    

## The Effects of Water and Ion Management for Modulate CO2 Reduction Selectivity Via Anode Control

The process of conversion ethylene through carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) shows potential in catalysis by encouraging the formation of C-C bonds while reducing the occurrence of competing reactions(1). Despite their potential, a deeper understanding of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems is needed due to their low selectivity. The MEA configuration, which eliminates the need for a catholyte, delivers humidified CO 2 to the cathode, enhancing CO 2 solubility and minimizing overall ohmic resistance by maintaining a narrow electrode gap, thus boosting energy efficiency(2). However, in MEA, since protons and ions from the anolyte for reaction are supplied to the catalyst through a membrane, additional understanding of the electrolyte supply effect is needed to optimize the overall system(3). Ions and water of electrolytes are essential for CO 2 RR. Water serves as a proton source for CO 2 RR and facilitates ion transport. However, the delicate balance of water is crucial in CO 2 RR systems. While water is necessary for proton supply, an excess of water at the cathode can lead to complications, particularly in promoting the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)(4). HER can occur alongside CO 2 RR and consume protons and electrons, thereby reducing the selectivity of CO 2 conversion and diminishing overall efficiency. Balancing the concentrations of ions and water is crucial for optimizing cell voltage and overall performance, highlighting the necessity of effective water and ion management approaches. While much research on water management has focused on cathodes, electrolytes, and membranes, the properties of the anodes have been relatively neglected. This study proposes the hypothesis that modulation of the anode electrode can have a significant impact on CO 2 RR performance. When comparing Ti-mesh, which facilitates the passage of electrolyte, with carbon paper, which restricts electrolyte movement, localized pH changes and optimal ethylene production efficiency were observed. In particular, in situ/operando analysis shows that under conditions of insufficient water and ion supply, local pH effects are promoted and Cu valence increases during CO 2 RR, resulting in optimal ethylene production efficiency at low current densities. However, at high current densities, the reaction was not evenly distributed and catalytic activity decreased. On the other hand, when water and ions are supplied smoothly, the ethylene production efficiency increases as the current density increases, showing that the material is sufficiently transferred. In addition, it was confirmed through the backside image that water crossed over to the cathode at the same time. This shows that the anode can affect the catalytic activity of the cathode side. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of effective ion and water management in improving CO 2 RR efficiency in MEA and highlights the central role of the anode in this process.

Integrating garnet-type lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) solid electrolytes into all-solid-state or hybrid batteries presents numerous challenges. One significant obstacle is the spontaneous formation of lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ) when surfaces of LLZO are exposed to moisture and carbon dioxide, which can lead to high interfacial impedance with electrodes and deleterious effects on the mechanical, electrochemical, and safety performance of the materials. Current methods for removing Li 2 CO 3 include mechanical polishing and thermal treatment under inert gas, both of which are time-consuming and difficult to scale up or implement in practical applications. We report on the use of atmospheric pressure (open-air) blown arc discharge plasma to remove Li 2 CO 3 species from the surface of tantalum doped LLZO (LLZTO). Open-air plasma technology offers a unique opportunity for surface treatments and functionalization by driving reactions and changes to surfaces that are not possible with other plasma or modification approaches. The proccess can also be scaled and implemented in continuous, roll-to-roll processing. In this method, compressed N 2 gas at room temperature is passed through a high voltage zone (1 kV) at a controllable rate (20 liters per minute in this study), where it is ionized. The gas blows the plasma discharge out of a nozzle, and the LLZTO sample is placed at approximately ~1 mm away from the afterglow. The uniqueness of the open-air plasma system is the combination of energy sources which are generated: electrons and reactive species (radicals, metastables, and photons) are produced in combination with convective heat to rapidly transfer energy to enable ultrafast precursor conversion or post-treatment. The plasma treatment is carried out entirely in ambient conditions (RH ~40%) and is enabled by use of a custom-built metal shroud that is placed around the plasma nozzle to prevent moisture and carbon dioxide from reacting with the sample. After the plasma treatment, compressed gas is introduced through the shroud to mitigate reformation of the Li 2 CO 3 as the sample is cooling. The surface chemistry of the LLZTO is characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to quantify the rate at which Li 2 CO 3 forms in ambient on a fresh LLZTO surface, as well as to assess the effect of plasma process parameters on removal of the Li 2 CO 3 surface species. Specifically, we focus on 3 parameters: treatment time (5, 10, 20 or 40 minutes) and shroud gas chemistry (N 2 or O 2 ) used after treatment. The most substantial reduction in Li 2 CO 3 contamination on the LLZTO surface is achieved after 20 minutes of exposure to open-air plasma with a N 2 shroud gas. To examine the impacts of the plasma treatment on the interfacial resistance, we prepared symmetric cells comprising LLZTO pellets contacted with nonblocking electrodes made from lithium-tin alloy. We find that the open-air plasma treatment can significantly reduce the interface impedance to levels comparable with those measured when using mechanical polishing to remove the Li 2 CO 3 . Additionally, we find that the plasma treatment may also be used to modify the LLZTO structure and microstructure properties, and can also be used on other types of garnets. The results show that this platform demonstrates a path towards open-air processed solid-state batteries with improved interfacial and microstructural properties.

Controlling the redox ability is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in clean energy, environmental protection, and CO2 reduction, as it directly influences the reaction efficiency and electron transfer rates, driving sustainable and effective outcomes. Here, we report the plasma-electrified synthesis of composition-controlled FeAu bimetallic nanoparticles, specifically engineered to enhance the redox catalytic performance through precise tuning of their chemical states. Utilizing atmospheric-pressure microplasmas, FeAu nanoparticles were synthesized under ambient conditions without the need for reducing agents or organic solvents, thereby providing a green and sustainable approach. The catalytic activity of the FeAu nanoparticles was significantly influenced by the oxidation states of Au modulated by adjusting the process. This precise tuning directly affects the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the nanoparticles, driving their superior degradation performance. The FeAu-1.52 sample exhibited the highest normalized rate constant (k=46.3 s-1 g-1), attributed to an optimal Au+/Au0 ratio that facilitates efficient electron transfer and redox cycling during the catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). Beyond 4-NP, the FeAu nanoparticles demonstrated robust catalytic degradation of multiple dye pollutants for industrial wastewater treatment. This study elucidates the critical role of chemical state tuning in determining redox performance and presents a promising nanotechnology platform for sustainable environmental remediation.

Malaysia has restricted the use of biodiesel blends to B7 in the highlands due to challenges related to cold flow operability, while B10 and B20 are used in the lowlands. This study evaluated the performance and emissions of a light-duty, 4-cylinder Euro III turbocharged common rail direct injection diesel vehicle using palm biodiesel blends (B10, B20, and B30) at speeds of 60, 80, and 100 km/h under simulated cold temperatures of 10, 15, and 20°C in a controlled cold chamber. The combustion of B10 and B20 in the diesel engine showed enhancements in power and torque of 3.9% and 4.6%, respectively, compared to Euro 2M (B7) diesel. These improvements are likely the result of the synergistic effects of the enriched oxygen levels in biodiesel and the increased density of cold air, which enhance combustion efficiency. CO2 emissions decreased by 1.5%, 4.3%, and 11.2% with the use of B10, B20, and B30 fuels, respectively. NOx emissions decreased as biodiesel content increased at 10 and 15°C; however, the emissions increased by 17.6% and 38.2% for B20 and B30, respectively, in comparison to B10 at 20°C. B20 demonstrated good engine performance and emissions at 15°C, with improvements of 1.3% in power and 3.7% in torque, which compensated for a 3.2% increase in fuel consumption, and there were reductions of 8.9% in NOx emissions and 0.9% in CO2 emissions compared to B7 diesel. Palm biodiesel blends ranging from 7 wt.% to 20 wt.% are capable of withstanding the moderate cold ambient temperatures of the highlands without compromising engine operation.

Platinum is widely used as a reduction promoter in transition metal heterogeneous catalysts, while its effects on the catalyst’s properties and CO hydrogenation behavior remain unclear. In this study, an improvement in the reducibility of platinum-promoted catalysts is observed. Notably, platinum suppresses the aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles (CoNPs) during catalyst preparation, as evidenced by STEM/TEM and XRD analyses, which reveal the presence of smaller CoNPs and weakened cobalt diffraction in platinum-promoted catalysts. In addition, platinum also promotes the formation of more active hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cobalt but inhibits metal-support interaction (MSI). Therefore, the cobalt-time yield (CTY) for CO hydrogenation in the promoted catalyst is strongly improved, and, furthermore, its intrinsic activity (turnover frequency, TOF) is also slightly increased. However, the product distribution seems unchanged except for the CO2 for the platinum-promoted catalysts.    

    

## “Green” use of fluorocarbons in Cherenkov detectors and silicon tracker cooling systems: challenges and opportunities.

Saturated fluorocarbons (SFCs: chemical form CnF(2n+2)) are chosen for their optical properties as Cherenkov radiators, with C4F10 and CF4 used in the COMPASS and LHCb Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors at CERN. Their non-conductivity, non-flammability and radiation resistance also make them ideal coolants, with C6F14 liquid used in all LHC experiments, and C3F8 used as an evaporative coolant in the ATLAS silicon tracker. While SFCs have high Global Warming Potentials (GWP typically > 5000*CO2), fluoro-ketones (FKs: of chemical form CnF2nO) can offer similar performance at very low, or zero-GWP. This paper considers use of heavy SFC and FK vapours in Cherenkov detectors. The blending of high-order (C > 4) SFC or FK vapours with a light carrier gas is explored to replicate the refractivities of CF4 and C4F10, to reduce or eliminate the GWP "load" (in equivalent tonnes of CO2) in large Cherenkov radiator volumes. Subject to optical testing, 3M NOVEC® 5110 (C5F10O) - blended with N2 and controlled in real time using sound velocity gas mixture analysis - could replace C4F10 and CF4 in RICH detectors. New, non-cyclic isomers of C4F8O could directly replace C4F10 and - blended with N2 - also replace CF4. Noting the impending EU restrictions on fluorinated compounds, and (2025) withdrawal of 3M Corp. from the PFAS (Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) market, radiator GWP load reduction through use of legacy stocks of C5F12 & C4F10 - blended with N2 to replicate the respective refractivities of C4F10 & CF4 - is also considered. The radiation tolerance and thermal performance of 3M NOVEC® 649 (C6F12O) liquid was sufficiently promising for to be considered to replace C6F14 in liquid cooling applications at CERN. Although not industrialized over the full CnF2nO range, lighter (C < 4) fluoro-ketone molecules - for example C2F4O isomers, with similar thermodynamics to C2F6, and subject to toxicity, materials compatibility and low-GWP verifications - might allow lower operating temperatures than possible with evaporative C3F8 or CO2 for the cooling of future silicon trackers operating in high luminosity environments.

With the increasing global attention to environmental issues and climate change, power companies, as an important energy production sector, are facing severe challenges in reducing pollution and carbon emissions. In view of this, this study is based on the metal organic framework MIL-101(Cr), physically encapsulating metalloporphyrins and synthesizing a FeTPP@MIL-101(Cr) complex. Then, the surface characteristics and adsorption performance of the composite are evaluated, and the pressure swing physical adsorption method is introduced to achieve the goal of carbon reduction and pollution reduction. The ICP-OES loading results showed that the corresponding encapsulation amounts in MIL@-A and MIL@-B composites were 5.24% and 3.20%, respectively. Moreover, when the temperature increased from 273 K to 298 K, the adsorption capacity of all test gases on the three samples showed a decreasing trend. Under ideal atmospheric pressure conditions, the adsorption capacity of MIL@-A encapsulation for CO2 did not decrease and increased, while the adsorption capacity for N2 was relatively small, but still had a certain adsorption capacity. The above results indicate that combining the pressure swing physical adsorption method with FeTPP@MIL-101(Cr) complexes can effectively adsorb pollutants generated by power enterprises, achieve predetermined goals, and help promote clean production in power enterprises.

This study investigates the effects of adding steam to the oxidizer on the combustion behavior of coke oven gas through numerical simulations. The analysis used the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Ansys Fluent. The results obtained for the case where dry air was used as the oxidizer were compared with experimental data. The k-Ɛ standard turbulence model was employed for turbulence modeling, while the PDF/Mixture Fraction combustion model and the P-1 radiation model were used for the three-dimensional numerical simulations. According to the simulation results, adding steam to the oxidizer slightly reduced the temperature of the COG. When assessing the emissions, it was observed that NOX emissions significantly decreased, while CO2 emissions showed a slight reduction. However, CO emissions were found to increase slightly. In conclusion, the study indicates that adding steam to the oxidizer significantly mitigates the high NOX emissions typically associated with using coke oven gas as an alternative fuel.

Electrochemistry has become a key player in establishing a global sustainable energy landscape. Unfortunately, most electrochemical processes are limited in their efficiency and selectivity which has prevented them from replacing carbon-intensive industrial processes. Computational simulations have the potential to conquer the vast chemical space and reveal so far unconsidered new electrocatalysts and boost the performance of these devices. This, however, requires the knowledge of computationally accessible activity and selectivity descriptors. In this work, and by the example of electrochemical CO2 reduction, it is shown that the conventionally considered adsorption energy descriptor is not enough to distinguish product selectivity among catalysts. Including specifically the electrochemical environment in the quantum chemical calculations, we find that a charge-transfer descriptor is separately re- quired, such as the work function or the potential of zero charge. With this, experimental trends in product selectivity can be well described, thus providing a new set of descriptors for high-throughput screening of electrocatalysts.

Changes in an organism’s DNA can influence all aspects of its life. Mutations serve as raw material for genetic variability and its evolution. These are caused by high-energy radiation. Chemical substances present in the environment are other potential causative agents. They may also occur during DNA replication. Radiation damage has increased many folds after the advent of cellular telephony. Genes are DNA molecules. These molecules are distributed on the chromosomes of individuals or populations of a species. Some populations grow faster than others. Why? The chapter tries to find an answer to it. Population increase has been observed in some countries and for others, a decrease has been detected. It has been predicted that the human population will increase to 8.5 billion in 2030 from 7. 8 billion in 2020. The exploitation of natural resources would increase accordingly. World Economic Forum reports that research conducted at the Swiss Re Institute has pointed out that an 18 percent reduction in GDP is achievable by 2050 if the Global temperature rise is restricted to 3.20 C. About 16 to 29% reduction in CO2 emissions would lead to a less dangerous climate change provided population growth is slowed down. If factors contributing to Global warming are managed in such a way that the Global temperature rises by 1.50 C, Sustainable Development Goals are achievable. Net–zero emissions targeted to be achieved by 2050 are not feasible as international agreements are not honored.

Abstract This paper investigates a novel methodology for measuring greenhouse gas emissions by re-evaluating the packaging and transport systems of local communities at a time when concerns about environmental sustainability and the fight against climate change are increasingly heightened. The research first presents CO2 emissions data associated with each logistical sub-process and the methodology used to calculate the CO2 emissions associated with the products. Then, the analysis of a local community-owned asset exchange is presented. Based on the packaging size and weight of the items, calculations are made of the CO2 impact of transporting a product from different distances. The results are also analyzed by investigating the activity of the local community with four different modes of transport and then comparing the amount of CO2 emitted to the population of a city. The study demonstrates that freight transport operations are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions and seeks to identify opportunities that could lead to significant carbon footprint reductions through community initiatives. The paper points out that even a local community exchange of goods could make a significant contribution to reducing global CO2 emissions. Therefore, in addition to measures to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, implementing a "Think globally, act locally" policy would contribute significantly to CO2 emissions reductions.

The role of hydrogen is emphasized in many countries' energy and climate strategies, yet the impacts of regional hydrogen-supporting policies remain underexplored. This study analyzes recently announced hydrogen-supporting policies across five provinces in northern China. Four scenarios – Current Policy (CP), Announced Policy (AP), Enhanced Policy (EP), and Net-Zero Emissions (NZE) – are developed and assessed using a dedicated hydrogen planning model, MESSAGEix-H2NC. With cumulative demand of end-use applications expanding 1.3 times compared to CP, the AP scenario's absence of carbon emission constraints leads to a reliance on non-clean hydrogen, resulting in higher carbon emissions than CP. Cost reductions under EP achieve lower emission intensity (11.9 kgCO2/kgH2 by 2030 and 3.6 kgCO2/kgH2 by 2060). Consequently, the investment gap for EP grows from $2.4 billion in 2025 to $89.7 billion in 2060, while the gap for more thorough net-zero emissions (NZE) expands from $10 billion in 2025 to $107 billion in 2060. The investment gap between EP and NZE relative to CP expands over time. Overall, the model results highlight potential deficiencies in current hydrogen development plans and incentive policies in northern China. These findings reveal a misalignment between current policies and CO2 reduction targets and underscore the need for accelerated technological advancements to improve cost competitiveness.

The aviation sector has a significant role to play in the reduction of carbon emissions, particularly in light of EU emissions targets. Within the EU, aviation emissions constitute 13.9 per cent of total transport emissions, where under the Green Deal a target of 90 per cent reduction in transport emissions by 2050 has been set. Several tax exemptions apply to the aviation sector due to its international nature, which have contributed to an increasing trend in emissions. Recent movements in EU policy under the ‘Fit for 55’ package, as well as public and political interest, have focused attention on changing the taxation struc-ture of the aviation industry in order to reduce CO2 emissions. This report focuses on several different potential policies and taxation structures which would attempt to decrease the emissions of the aviation sector: the removal of kerosene taxation exemption (in line with the recent EU proposal), removal of VAT exemption, introduction of a passenger tax, and abolition of free EU ETS allowances by 2026 (in line with the recent EU proposal). Each of these policies, as well a combination scenario, is assessed with respect to the impacts on the aviation industry, spillover effects, macro-economic and government revenue effects, and household effects, as well as the emissions impacts. This analysis applies the Ireland, Environment, Energy and Economy (I3E) model, which allows for the examination of spillover effects of the aviation industry to government, households and other industries. This methodology does not, however, allow for a detailed analysis of different passenger or airline types. In what follows, results are shown as cumulative percentage changes compared to no aviation taxation. Hence a decrease does not present an annual decrease but the build up of a cumulative decrease from 2022 to the given year.

Fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, are currently the primary energy source for the world’s needs. However, their depletion and role in the development of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming and climate change, necessitate the exploration of alternative green energy sources to promote a cleaner environment. Hydrogen, in particular, has emerged as a promising renewable energy fuel for the future. One promising method for producing hydrogen is urea-assisted water splitting, which has the potential to improve both hydrogen production productivity and energy conversion efficiency. However, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a complex six-electron transfer process with slow reaction kinetics and unclear mechanisms, which requires a high overpotential. This has led to the need to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. In general, the majority of research has been directed towards the synthesis of robust, efficient, and economically viable catalysts. In recent years, light irradiation has been introduced into an electrochemical system with the aim of enhancing the activities of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Insights into the mechanism demonstrate that external excitation effectively accelerates charge and mass transfer and thus improves the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. In contrast to previous catalyst modifications, the external field assistance approach allows for greater flexibility in engineering an electrochemical process with facile, continuous, reversible, dynamic, and universal control. However, the utilization of photothermal-assisted urea oxidation reaction has not been reported yet. In this research, we report a CuS/WO 3 composite electrocatalyst with a direct Z-scheme system for photothermally-assisted UOR. Upon irradiation with light, the CuS/WO 3 electrode exhibited a reduced overpotential of 308.2 mV, resulting in a UOR current density of 50 mA cm -2 . Additionally, the CuS/WO 3 electrode achieved a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE under irradiation. The catalytic activity of the CuS/WO 3 electrode was found to be significantly enhanced, exhibiting a 2.5- and 2.8-fold increase compared to that of CuS and WO 3 , respectively. This enhancement can be attributed to the enhanced redox abilities of charge carriers in the direct Z-scheme system. Our studies demonstrate the importance of direct Z-scheme formation in light utilization and the synergistic effect of photon and photothermal on UOR. Figure 1

Recent advancements in reconstructive techniques for burn-induced skin defects have improved functional and aesthetic outcomes to enhance life quality of burn survivors. A wide range of innovative methods such as flap surgeries advancements or laser therapies and tissue expansion techniques are now available in the markets and their use has been widely explored for management of extensive post-burn scarring. According to studies the use of latest technological innovations and microvascular free tissue transfer, Z-plasty and trapeze flaps have excellent success rates for contracture release, scar reduction, and functional restoration. Laser treatments that have shown promise in decreasing scar thickness and increasing suppleness include stromal vascular fraction therapy and CO2 fractional lasers. There remain persisting issues like limited long-term data, expense, and technical complexity. In order to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, drawbacks, and potential future directions of these reconstructive techniques in burn care, this review summarizes recent research.

Background/Objective: The relationship between food consumption and environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly evident. The aim of this study was to estimate the evolution of the environmental impact of food consumption in the Spanish population, assessed in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Methods: Data collected from the Household Budget Survey were included, from approximately 24,000 households for the period of 2006–2023. The environmental impact of diet, in terms of GHG emissions, was estimated from the EAT-Lancet Commission tables, and the adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) was calculated using the Dietary Score index. Results: The environmental impact of the Spanish diet, in terms of GHG, followed a downward trend over the years analysed, from 3978.1 g CO2-eq in 2006 to 3281.4 g CO2-eq in 2023, a decrease of 17.5%. The food groups with the largest decrease in consumption during this period were red meat (from 39.9 kg/year to 35.5 kg/year), fish (from 24.3 kg/year to 19.0 kg/year), and dairy products (from 113.4 kg/year to 99.7 kg/year). The level of adherence to the MedDiet increased slightly from 34 points in 2006 to 35 points in 2023 due to an increase in the amount of vegetables (42.7 kg/year vs. 44.3 kg/year) and grains consumed (53.1 kg/year vs. 72.6 kg/year) and a decrease in fish consumption (24.3 kg/year vs. 19.0 kg/year). Conclusions: In Spain, a reduction in GHG emissions associated with food consumption was observed due to a decrease in the consumption of red meat, fish, dairy products, and fats. National surveys are very useful tools to analyse the impact of food consumption on climate change and to assess the effect of the policies implemented to contain it.

Biochar, derived from waste biomass, is a potent material for carbon dioxide sequestration, owing to its stable, non-degradable aromatic structure [1]. Biochar is found to have advantageous characteristics, such as a unique pore structure, large specific surface area, complex surface-active functional groups, and stable chemical properties. These properties make biochar as a high potential biosorbent for removal of pollutants from water [2]. Meanwhile, the escalating use of pharmaceuticals has led to pervasive environmental residues, posing public health risks. Specifically, antibiotic contamination risks augmenting antibiotic resistance, underscoring the need for efficient wastewater treatment methods [3]. However, current wastewater treatment plant(WWTP) based on biological treatment was not effectively eliminate this types of waste in the water and it is necessary to investigate efficient method for removal of antibiotics from wastewater. This study explores the use of biochar for ciprofloxacin (CIP) removal from water and introduces a novel electrochemical biochar regeneration technique. We utilized sludge from chemical plants to produce biochar through standard and alkali-activated pyrolysis, yielding CB (normal pyrolysis) and CAB (alkali activated pyrolysis) types with distinct physicochemical properties. CAB, with an exceptionally high surface area (~2330 m²/g) and carbon purity (95.4%), demonstrated superior CIP adsorption capacity (~550 mg/g). We investigated the CIP adsorption isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamics to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, which appear dominated by π-π and electrostatic interactions facilitated by the high pyrolysis temperatures reducing oxygen-containing groups on the biochar. After the biochar became saturated with CIP, we regenerated it using joule heating in Ar atmosphere, employing the carbothermal shock method for rapid, short-duration temperature increases [4]. In contrast to traditional CTS which can sometimes lead to structural damage by directly heating the material on the carbon substrate [5], we used radiant heat from the CTS process to ensure controlled temperature elevation. This modified approach maintains the structural integrity of the biochar by avoiding direct contact between the biochar and the carbon substrate while facilitating the regeneration process. Additionally, this method facilitates the physical separation of the biochar from the carbon substrate, enhancing the recovery and reuse of biochar. Such an approach contributes to the efficient regeneration of biochar and environmentally friendly processing. We examined parameters such as distance from the substrate and duration to optimize the regeneration conditions. Ultimately, we assessed the efficacy of the CIP adsorption by the regenerated biochar. Traditional thermal treatments for biochar regeneration are energy-intensive and time-consuming. We propose an innovative approach using joule heating under a nitrogen atmosphere, employing carbothermal shock for rapid, efficient regeneration. By optimizing parameters such as voltage and duration, we identified ideal conditions for regenerating biochar, significantly enhancing its CIP adsorption efficacy. This study not only highlights the potential of biochar in environmental remediation but also introduces an energy-efficient regeneration method, contributing to sustainable pollution management solutions.

The electrocatalytic reaction pathway is highly dependent on the intrinsic structure of the catalyst. CO2/CO electroreduction has recently emerged as a potential approach for obtaining C2+ products, but it is challenging to achieve high selectivity for a single C2+ product. Herein, we develop a Cu atomic ensemble that satisfies the appropriate site distance and coordination environment required for electrocatalytic CO-to-acetate conversion, which shows outstanding overall performance with an acetate Faradaic efficiency of 70.2% with a partial current density of 225 mA cm–2 and a formation rate of 2.1 mmol h–1 cm–2. Moreover, a single-pass CO conversion rate of 91% and remarkable stability can be also obtained. Detailed experimental and theoretical investigations confirm the significant advantages of the Cu atomic ensembles in optimizing C–C coupling, stabilizing key ketene intermediate (*CCO), and inhibiting the *HOCCOH intermediate, which can switch the CO reduction pathway from the ethanol/ethylene on the conventional metallic Cu site to the acetate on the Cu atomic ensembles.

"Against the backdrop of global warming and the necessary reduction of CO2, the material wood is experiencing a renaissance as a result of increasing social acceptance. However, questions of harmless reforestation also come to the forefront. Ultimately, plantation cultivation of wood is unavoidable in order to meet the increasing demand for wood in the coming years. Agroforestry is the focus of economic and technical interest in this regard. Paulownia or Kiri tree belongs to the Paulowniaceae family and is the tree with the highest growth rate in the world. It has a large leaf area that can absorb correspondingly high amounts of CO2. Originally from China, it is now planted worldwide and is considered a climate tree. However, it must face the accusation of invasiveness. Therefore, less invasive varieties of Paulownia are of interest. However, these should also have appropriate mechanical properties. One of these material properties is damping, which significantly affects the acoustic behaviour. In this study, the strain-dependent damping was investigated by measuring the logarithmic decrement of free decaying bending oscillations. The measurements were carried out on a common Paulownia species (obtained from plantations in Georgia, Italy and Spain) and a new species of Paulownia obtained from a plantation in Germany. It is worth mentioning that the new wood variety was harvested for the first time in Germany. Since damping is strongly influenced by microstructure, which is in turn influenced by site-specific nutrient supply, this study examined how damping behaviour develops with strain and the extent of its variation. It was found that the damping curves exhibited a strain-independent and a strain-dependent area. The bending modulus was calculated from the oscillation frequency and showed that the values range from about 1024 N/mm2 to 5873 N/mm2 . This large variation appears to stem from the fiber orientation of the tested samples, which also affects the damping values. "

CO₂ emissions are one form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to global warming. CO₂ contributed 175.62 million tons in 2021, impacting greenhouse gas levels. One strategy to reduce the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere is to convert CO₂ gas into useful chemicals. One example of this is the hydrogenation of CO₂ to produce methane, which can serve as an alternative to LPG. The aim of this research is to produce methane gas by developing a fixed bed reactor in a simple manner. The catalyst Ni/Al2O3 with 20 grams and five regenerations could produce CH₄ up to 49.73% compared to 39.06% for those with 10 grams. However, the H2 gas remaining is higher for those with 10 grams (1.454 ppm compared to 1.042 ppm). Also, The CO2 gas remaining is higher for those with 10 grams (58.18% compared to 47.92%). The results of this study can be the basis for developing energy policies, encouraging investment in clean energy technologies, and supporting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for energy sustainability and resilience.

Introduction Ammonia has been used for diverse applications, and its worldwide demand is significantly high. Therefore, it is desirable to develop ammonia synthesis methods that do not emit carbon dioxide, unlike the Haber-Bosch process. In this context, lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (Li-NRR) has received much attention as an alternative method. Previous research 1) has shown that ethanol works as a good proton source for Li-NRR. However, there are some concerns about the use of ethanol, which is associated with its cost and sustainability. Alternatively, N 2 reduction would be paired with water oxidation in full-cell operation. Hence, Li-NRR with water as a proton source is ultimately desired. Recently, our group revealed that the addition of a certain amount of water improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) to ammonia in Li-NRR, mainly due to the modification of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) 2) . On the other hand, previous reports 3) show that other proton carriers could replace ethanol, and also proton carriers influence SEI composition and proton activity. Therefore, combining proton sources other than ethanol with water may tune the SEI composition and proton activity, making it suitable for operating in the presence of water. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Li-NRR in the presence of various amounts of water in electrolytes containing a variety of proton carriers. From this study, we aim to elucidate the factors that enable electrochemical ammonia synthesis in the presence of water, which is required to achieve Li-NRR using water as a proton source. Electrolytes were prepared by mixing (CF₃SO₂)₂NLi (LiTFSI) and tetrahydrofuran to make the 1 mol dm -3 electrolyte solution. Subsequently, various proton sources, such as ethanol, propanol, and phenol, as well as water were added to the electrolytes. The electrochemical measurements were conducted using electrolysis cells composed of a working electrode: Mo plate, counter electrode: Pt wire, and reference electrode: Li 1- x FePO 4 . During chronoamperometry (CA) at -4.5 V vs. Li 1- x FePO 4 , the applied charge was set at 10 C. After the electrolysis, the FE of ammonia formation was calculated using the quantification method reported elsewhere 4) . The FE obtained with water varied with the type of proton carrier used, indicating the importance of optimizing the proton source to enable the operation under the co-existence of water. In the presentation, we will show the results of Li-NRR with other proton carriers, and the correlation between FE and properties of proton source and/or SEI will be discussed.

Carbon black is one of the most ubiquitous reinforcing fine particles in use today for tyres and rubber goods, providing significantly enhanced performance, strength and lifetime. Without carbon black, tyres would have to be replaced at a significantly higher rate, and thus carbon black has proven to be one of the first, original sustainable materials providing a significant social contribution towards sustainable mobility and the benefits this concept brings to civilization. Additionally, carbon black is used for many specialty applications in plastics, inks, and coatings where its benefits as a colourant, conductive agent and UV-resistive material are realised, again providing higher performance and longer lasting materials with significant social benefit. In this chapter, the manufacturing processes for the various commercial carbon blacks produced today are reviewed, along with the fundamental properties of carbon black that play a key role in its performance in its numerous applications. Also discussed is the future of carbon black and the latest recycled and renewable materials that may compliment carbon black in the future, obviously with an eye toward future reductions in CO2 and the concept of sustainable carbon blacks.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties, but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active-learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results experimentally. To illustrate their catalytic implications, we examined the behavior of Rh single atoms on the reconstructed surfaces, focusing on CO2 activation, the rate-limiting step in the RWGS reaction. Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.

Sustainable energy has been focused on by the whole world for the earth-friendly development toward the goal of net-zero. Vehicle electrification is one of the most efficient strategies. However, lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) which are the primary power source used in electric vehicles need to overcome the obstacles of current LiBs, especially their high cost and low energy density. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the energy of LIBs to make them a practical replacement for internal combustion engines. Commercial electrodes are typically fabricated via slurry casting process. This involves mixing the active material, conductive additives, and polymer binder in a solvent: water for the anode and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) for the cathode, to form a slurry. NMP as a solvent, which incurs carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and leads to increased manufacturing costs due to high-temperature drying and solvent recovery processes. Recently, dry-processed electrodes have attracted attention as next generation method due to its cost reduction, eco-friendliness, and ability to realize extremely high mass loading electrode. Thick electrode design approaches can substantially increase the active material loading by decreasing the inactive component ratio at the cell level, thereby leading to increased battery energy density as well as decreased cost. In the fabrication of thick electrode through wet process, solvent evaporation can cause binder migration due to unhomogeneous distribution of binder during the drying of high mass loading slurry. Additionally, Li-ion diffusivity and electrolyte permeability are compromised due to the clogging of the electrode surface caused by migrated binder. On the other hand, dry process does not need a solvent for manafaturing electorde, removes the drying process required for solvent evaporation, thus reducing carbon emissions and processing costs. Especially, the fabrication of thick electrodes via dry process ensures uniform dispersion of active materials. A simple change in the electrode manufacturing process effectively overcome the aforementioned challenges in the slurry process and could provide numerous advantages to the LIBs system. The typically employed binder in dry-process polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) which has sticky properties under high stress to form PTFE fibrils. The obtained fibrils can act as a net to support active materials and conductive additives. The dry process innovates the routes of electrode fabrication form the traditional "powder-slurry-film" route to the simple "powder-film" route. However, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PTFE has a high affinity for electrons , electrochemically unstable when used as binder for anodes. During the initial lithiation process, PTFE undergoes defluorination, resulting in the formation of lithium fluoride and amorphous carbon. This irreversible decomposition causes lower the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and diminishes the binding properties of PTFE, which significantly deteriorates long-term cycling performances. In this work, we examined fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an electrolyte additive to explore how an FEC-derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) influences the irreversibility of PTFE and the electrochemical stability of a dry-processed graphite. The FEC-derived SEI reduced the irreversible side reactions of the PTFE and improved the ICE. The SEI also preserved the structural robustness of the PTFE. The alleviated PTFE deterioration not only achieved high cycle stability and high-rate performance but also suppressed graphite volume changes during cycling. The FEC additive improved the ICE of full cells from 72.5% (without FEC) to 83.8% (with FEC) and improved capacity retention from 53.7% (without FEC) to 85.7% (with FEC) in the full cells after 100 cycles. Furthermore, the dry-processed anode under ultrahigh areal capacity (7.5 mAh cm −2 ) exhibited excellent cycling stability for up to 200 cycles in a full cell with LFP. This study presents a promising strategy to alleviate PTFE degradation, enabling the widespread application of PTFE binders for cost-effective and eco-friendly dry battery manufacturing.

Abstract A research has been undertaken to investigate the possibility of producing sustainable lightweight geopolymer material by using waste zeolite (zeolite molecular sieve) as aluminates and silicates source and at the same time as lightweight medium. This was done by totally or partially replacement of fly ash by waste zeolite particles. Six geopolymer mixes were designed and produced using different source materials (fly ash F, fly ash C and zeolite) and alkaline solution of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide. From the results, it was found that using fly ash C resulted in producing geopolymer mix with higher density than those made with fly ash F (Gf mix). However, replacing the fly ash totally with the zeolite particles helped in producing lightweight geopolymer concrete (1600 kg/m 3 ) by achieving about 27% weight reduction and gaining about 5.1 MPa compressive strength. Not only reducing CO2 emissions by adopting zeolite- based geopolymer binder (instead of cement paste) but also achieving operational energy saving by producing lightweight concrete was obtained from producing lightweight geopolymer concrete as constructional material.

Various electrocatalysts have undergone extensive examination regarding their capacity to selectively produce desired products via the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Nonetheless, the efficiency of a CO2RR electrocatalyst does not guarantee the effectiveness of a co-catalyst on the semiconductor surface for photoelectrochemical CO2RR. Herein, we synthesize Bi2S3 nanorods and electrochemically reduce them to Bi nanoplates that adhere to substrates for use in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical CO2RR applications. Compared with bare Bi, the Bi 2 S 3 -derived Bi (S-Bi) nanoplates on carbon paper exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for formate (HCOO - ) in the electrochemical CO 2 RR, achieving a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 93%, with minimal H 2 production over a wide potential range. This highly selective S-Bi catalyst is being employed on the Si photocathode to investigate the behavior of electrocatalysts during photoelectrochemical CO 2 RR. The strong adhesion of the S-Bi nanoplates to the Si nanowire substrate and their unique catalytic properties afford exceptional activity and selectivity for HCOO - under simulated solar irradiation. The selectivity observed in electrochemical CO 2 RR using the S-Bi catalyst correlates with that seen in the photoelectrochemical CO 2 RR system. Combined pulsed potential methods and theoretical analyses reveal stabilization of the OCHO* intermediate on the S-Bi catalyst under specific conditions, which is critical for developing efficient catalysts for CO 2 -to-HCOO - conversion. These results emphasize the potential of S-Bi as an effective catalyst for CO 2 reduction reactions and provide valuable insights into optimizing the reaction mechanisms and enhancing the product selectivity, especially in conjunction with co-catalysts for Si photocathodes.

There has been a growing interest in tandem electrocatalysts with unique interfaces and synergetic functions, which have been reported to exhibit outstanding performance in activity [1] , selectivity [2] , and stability [3] . Besides the development of monolithic tandem nanostructures, nanoparticle (NP) assembly provides a more desirable and controllable strategy to elaborately design novel nanocatalysts for various applications. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) and 3D tandem nanostructures, 1D tandem nanostructures have attracted more interest due to their high electrochemical surface areas, great atomic utilization, and outstanding structural stability, all of which are highly favored to achieve better electrocatalytic activity and stability. However, controllable 1D NP assembly is still challenging to achieve due to its relatively high surface energy and anisotropy, not to mention the creation of periodic 1D heterogeneous nanostructures with intimate interfaces and clean surfaces. In this work, we report a strategy to obtain periodic Pt-Au nanowires (NWs) by the assembly of Pt-Au Janus NPs with the assistance of peptide T7 (Ac-TLTTLTN-CONH 2 ). We further demonstrate that the Pt-Au NWs show highly improved catalytic performance in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), a 5.3 times higher specific activity and a 2.5 times higher mass activity than that of the current state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. The charge transfer at the interfaces of adjacent Pt and Au regions could weaken the binding energy between Pt and CO or CO-like intermediates, contributing to the enhancement of activities in MOR. More importantly, the periodic Pt-Au NWs exhibit outstanding stability in MOR, where the mass activity of Pt-Au NWs after 1000 cycles retains 93.9%, much higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (30.6%). We believe that this strategy to design and obtain periodic NWs by the assembly of Janus NPs is universal and transformative to diverse electrocatalytic reactions to achieve synergistic effects and intimate interfaces with high catalytic activity. [4][5] In conclusion, we have obtained periodic Pt-Au NWs by the assembly of Pt-Au Janus NPs with the assistance of peptides and demonstrated their outstanding activities and stability in MOR. This research presents a strategy to develop periodic heterogeneous nanowires with intimate interfaces and synergistic effects by the 1D assembly of Janus NPs, which offers an opportunity to design and program periodic 1D tandem catalysts.

The Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) is a research and development consortia funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, which has engaged partners from national laboratories, universities, and industry to conduct multidisciplinary research at the intersection of biofuels and combustion sciences. Since 2016, the Co-Optima team has examined high-quality bioblendstocks, and their properties, as design variables for increasing efficiency in modern engines while decarbonizing on-road light- and heavy-duty vehicles. The objective of this analysis is to combine and expand upon research into Co-Optima multi-mode bioblendstocks, which blend with petroleum gasoline to form high efficiency fuels for combustion in both spark ignition and advanced compression ignition engines. Consequently, the economic and environmental impacts of deploying 10 different multi-mode bioblendstocks derived from renewable and circular resources are quantified. Each bioblendstock is evaluated across several variables including (1) target blend levels of 10, 20, and 30 vol %, (2) years from 2030 to 2050, (3) crude oil benchmark prices, (4) vehicle lifetime miles, and (5) incremental vehicle costs. A Monte Carlo simulator is developed using a refinery optimization model and life-cycle analysis tool from prior Co-Optima research to sample marginal abatement costs of CO2, or cost of removing an additional unit of CO2, corresponding to each bioblendstock while considering input variable uncertainties. Results show that the combination of efficiency gains from advanced multi-mode fuel-engine technologies and the reoptimization of refinery operations results in several bioblendstocks demonstrating near-zero expected marginal abatement costs. Variable importances are also explored to highlight which aspects of the multi-mode technology are most influential in determining marginal abatement costs. Results suggest that Co-Optima multi-mode technology could provide economically viable decarbonization contributions to electrification-resistant light-duty vehicle sectors or near-term emission reductions, while Co-Optima fuels or alternatives decarbonize further to reach net-zero status.

Quantum computing (QC) provides a promising avenue toward enabling quantum chemistry calculations, which are classically impossible due to a computational complexity that increases exponentially with system size. As fully fault-tolerant algorithms and hardware, for which an exponential speedup is predicted, are currently out of reach, recent research efforts are dedicated to developing and scaling algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to showcase the practical utility of such machines. To demonstrate the utility of NISQ devices in the field of chemistry, we apply our recently developed FAST-VQE algorithm and a novel quantum gate reduction strategy based on propositional satisfiability together with standard optimization tools for the simulation of the rate-determining proton transfer step for CO2 hydration catalysed by carbonic anhydrase resulting in the first application of a quantum computing device for the simulation of an enzymatic reaction. To this end, we have combined classical force field simulations with quantum mechanical methods on classical and quantum computers in a hybrid calculation approach. The presented technique significantly enhances the accuracy and capabilities of QC-based molecular modeling and finally pushes it into compelling and realistic applications. The framework is general and can be applied beyond the case of computational enzymology.

Enhancing the flame retardancy of biobased rigid polyurethane foams is a crucial step towards improving the sustainability of the polyurethane industry. In this work, we systematically analyzed the effect of increasing the isocyanate index (NCOindex) and the flame retardant content using a polyol with high renewable content (&gt;97 wt.%). We found outstanding results regarding the CO(g)/CO2(g) index, the most important safety parameter in terms of human safety, whereas a significant reduction of 78% and 69.6 % was observed as a function of increasing the NCOindex and flame retardant (FR) content, respectively. In addition, the FR did not cause an increase of the total smoke produced (TSP), on the contrary, it decreased up to 31.4% after increasing the FR concentration. The MAHRE parameter was also substantially improved, up to 40.6%, indicating the formation of a thicker char layer which protected the foam during burning. This was achieved simultaneously with outstanding improvements of the specific compressive strength of up to +155%. The studies were substantiated by a comprehensive physico-chemical characterization using TGA analysis, water absorption, initial thermal conductivity, FTIR analysis and cell geometry using SEM. These results are of paramount importance to promote the use of biobased rigid polyurethane foams with enhanced fire retardancy.

Research on future energy is underway due to the problems caused by global warming and fossil fuel depletion. Of particular interest among these is hydrogen energy, which is garnering significant attention due to its high energy density per unit mass and its abundance in space. Additionally, it has the advantage of being eco-friendly since it can be produced by electrolyzing water and does not produce carbon dioxide as a by-product when used. The methods for electrolyzing water include alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE). In alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), achieving high current density is challenging due to significant ohmic losses arising from the considerable distance between the anode and cathode. For proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the electrodes are closely situated within the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) structure, allowing for high current density. However, it suffers from the drawback of requiring precious metals due to the harsh corrosion conditions. AEMWE combines the advantages of PEMWE's compact structure and AWE's utilization of transition metals as catalysts. However, further research is needed on AEMWE as it has not yet reached the performance level of PEMWE, which uses noble metal catalysts known for their high reactivity in electrolysis. In water electrolysis, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs at the cathode, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place at the anode. In the HER, two electrons are involved in the reaction, whereas in the OER, four electrons are involved, resulting in a slower reaction rate for OER. Therefore, since the overall reaction rate of water electrolysis is determined by OER, research on the OER catalyst is essential. Among transition metals, Ni is known to be a good catalyst for OER, and research is underway on Ni-based catalysts enhanced in activity and durability through synergy effects with other transition metals such as Fe, Co, and Mo. However, as the performance still falls short compared to precious metals, incorporating a small amount of precious metals alongside can enhance the catalyst's performance. Precious metals such as Ir and Ru are known for their good activity in the OER. Nonetheless, Ir is considerably more expensive than Ru, and since Ru exhibits slightly superior activity, we intend to use Ru. There are several methods for synthesizing catalysts, including chemical precipitation, chemical vapor deposition, hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel method, and electrodeposition. Among them, electrodeposition allows for the variation of catalyst composition, morphology, thickness by changing the composition of the solution, applied voltage, and time. Moreover, it occurs at room temperature and pressure and offers rapid fabrication times, making it advantageous for scaling up from lab scale to industrial scale in the future. Galvanic replacement is a spontaneous substitution reaction that occurs due to the standard reduction potential difference between two metals. The metal with a relatively higher (more negative) standard reduction potential undergoes oxidation to form ions, while the metal with a lower standard reduction potential is reduced from ions to metal. Through this reaction, a small amount of precious metals can be doped onto the surface in nanoparticle form. Since this reaction occurs spontaneously, no additional devices are required, and it can occur at room temperature and pressure, similar to electrodeposition, making it suitable for scaling up to industrial scale. Here in, we synthesized NiFe catalysts on SUS paper via the electrodeposition method. Moreover, we incorporated a small amount of Ru through galvanic replacement. We evaluated the performance of the catalysts under 1 M KOH conditions. In the half-cell test, NiFe/SUS exhibited an overpotential of 256 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 , which was reduced to 229 mV with Ru doping. In the single-cell test, Ru-NiFe/SUS showed excellent performance, achieving 8.3 A at 80°C and 2 V.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile class of materials that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. A growing number of studies aim to identify potential new SACs or to describe their structure and reactivity through ab initio quantum chemical simulations. While many computational studies primarily address reactions involving small molecules, such as water splitting or CO2 reduction, the application scope of SACs is rapidly broadening to include the production of fine chemicals and the conversion of biomass-derived platform molecules, processes that involve larger, more complex reactants. Using density-functional theory (DFT) simulations, we demonstrate that, while an approximate treatment of entropy is acceptable for molecules with up to three atoms, it introduces substantial errors in reactions involving more complex molecules. Our results reveal a linear correlation between the entropy of adsorbed molecules and that of the corresponding isolated species, mirroring trends observed on extended catalytic surfaces. For the largest systems investigated in this study, the entropy of the free molecule is reduced by approximately 10–20% upon adsorption; for small molecules, this reduction can range from 50 to 70%. This disparity arises because, on SACs, the translational entropy is effectively zero, the rotational entropy is minimal, and the vibrational entropy increases with the size of the molecule. Moreover, the entropy of adsorbates scales linearly with the number of atoms in the molecule, allowing for the prediction of entropic contributions of adsorbates on SACs without additional computational cost. Using propyne hydrogenation as a test, we demonstrate that the reaction energy profile computed with current approximate approaches for estimating the entropy of adsorbates differs significantly from the profile where entropy is explicitly included. These findings highlight the importance of considering adsorbate entropy for accurately predicting the catalytic activity of SACs, particularly for reactions involving complex molecules.

This paper presents a framework for optimisation and techno-economic analysis of various pressurisation pathways for CO2 pipeline transportation. The pressurisation pathways include a conventional compression only case from initial to final pressure, a sub-critical compression part followed by cooling, liquefaction and pumping and also a super-critical compression part followed by cooling and dense phase pumping. The presented framework is developed based on open-source components and information available in the public domain. The framework includes a high level of flexibility to study variations in intial and final pressures, inclusion of inter-stage pressure drop, inter-stage cooling temperature, liquefaction/pumping pressure, among others. The implemented methods i.e. the thermodynamic and economic models applied, are rigorously validated and bench-marked against literature data. Contrary to former studies that focus mainly on reduction of the work required for pressurisation, the presented method includes additional capabilities to assess CAPEX, OPEX and the levelised cost of CO$_2$ compression. The analysis shows that in some cases the minimum levelised cost does not coincide with the minimum work. It is also demonstrated that for some cases the super-critical compression/cooling/pumping case and the sub-critical compression/cooling/liquefaction/pumping pathways provide optimal levelised cost compared to a multi-stage compression only case.

Aims Arthroplasty has been shown to generate the most waste among all orthopaedic subspecialties, and it is estimated that hip and knee arthroplasty generate in excess of three million kg of waste annually in the UK. Infectious waste generates up to ten times more CO2 compared with recycled waste, and previous studies have shown that over 90% of waste in the infectious stream is misallocated. We assessed the effect of real-time waste segregation by an unscrubbed team member on waste generation in knee and hip arthroplasty cases, and compared this with a simple educational intervention during the ‘team brief’ at the start of the operating list across two sites. Methods Waste was categorized into five categories: infectious, general, recycling, sharps, and linens. Each category was weighed at the end of each case using a digital weighing scale. At Site A (a tertiary orthopaedic hospital), pre-intervention data were collected for 16 total knee arthroplasy (TKA) and 15 total hip arthroplasty (THA) cases. Subsequently, for ten TKA and ten THA cases, an unscrubbed team member actively segregated waste in real-time into the correct streams. At Site B (a district general hospital), both pre- and post-intervention groups included ten TKA and ten THA cases. The intervention included reminding staff during the ‘team brief’ to segregate waste correctly. Results Active real-time waste segregation reduced infectious waste by a mean of 2.51 kg (95% CI 1.492 to 3.542) in TKA, and 1.83 kg in THA cases (p = 0.004). Educational intervention reduced infectious waste by a mean of 3.52 kg in TKA and 2.09 kg in THA cases (p = 0.026). Total waste was significantly reduced in both groups post-intervention for TKA cases. Conclusion Simple educational measures alone can significantly reduce the amount of infectious waste. Extrapolated nationally, our results would yield a reduction of approximately 315,004 kg to 594,577 kg of CO2 annually, which equates to 70 to 132 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for a year.

Summary This study initiates a series of tests to examine the application of Type IL cement for well-cementing operations. Type IL cement is a blend of 5–15% limestone with Type I/II Portland cement. This substitution by reducing the amount of CO2 emitted from cement plants can be aligned with sustainability efforts in the cement industry. We first measured the properties of cement slurry made of Type IL cement and compared them with specifications for the well cementing. The properties of hardened cement including the compressive strength and bonding strength were also examined. For compressive strength measurement, both cubic and cylindrical samples were prepared. To measure the bonding strength, the modified pushout test was used. We also investigated the effect of severe environments on the strength reduction of the hardened cement. In addition, the scaled abandonment plugging setup was used to quantify the sealing capabilities of Type IL cement in a well-plugging scenario. To force nitrogen flow through, differential pressure was applied to the system by decreasing the pressure above the plug-in controlled timesteps. We found that Type IL hardened cement offers substantial sealing capabilities compared with data available in the literature, although the leakage rate seems to gradually increase with each increase in differential pressure.

Diet is one of the main factors shaping the human microbiome, yet our understanding of how specific dietary components influence microbial consortia assembly and subsequent stability in response to press disturbances – such as increasing resource availability (feeding rate) – is still incomplete. This study explores the reproducible re-assembly, metabolic interplay, and compositional stability within microbial consortia derived from pooled stool samples of three healthy infants. Using a single-step packed-bed reactor (PBR) system, we assessed the reassembly and metabolic output of consortia exposed to lactose, glucose, galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and humanized GOS (hGOS). Our findings reveal that complex carbohydrates, especially those containing low inclusion (~1.25 gL−1) components present in human milk, such as N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc), promote taxonomic, and metabolic stability under varying feeding rates, as shown by diversity metrics and network analysis. Targeted metabolomics highlighted distinct metabolic responses to different carbohydrates: GOS was linked to increased lactate, lactose to propionate, sucrose to butyrate, and CO2, and the introduction of bile salts with GOS or hGOS resulted in butyrate reduction and increased hydrogen production. This study validates the use of single-step PBRs for reliably studying microbial consortium stability and functionality in response to nutritional press disturbances, offering insights into the dietary modulation of microbial consortia and their ecological dynamics.

These compounds were differed by the isomerism of the meso-substituent of the porphyrin molecule and the nature of the counterion (Ts-, I-). The data of the redox-behavior and efficiency of the use of porphyrin compounds in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been obtained. The electrochemical behavior has been studied by using the cycling voltammetry method. It should be noted that two stages of the electroreduction process were observed in an argon medium for ligands. For the cobalt complexes additional processes was found. The process of the porphyrin macrocycle electroreduction in the potential region of -0.78 ... -1.36 V and the Co3+↔Co2+, oxidation (reduction) process localized on the metal atom at Еred/ox= 0.19 V were found. The N-substitution of the pyridyl fragment of porphyrins leads to a small increase in their reducing ability, in comparison with unsubstituted tetrapyridylporphyrins [H2(Py-4- and -3)4P]. The possibility of using water-soluble porphyrins in the ORR electrocatalysis has been considered. It has been shown that the nature of the metal cation has a significant effect on the electrocatalytic activity of compounds in the molecular oxygen ionization reaction of in an aqueous-alkaline media. The activity of Сo-complexes was increased by ~ 50-90 mV compared with ligands and a system without a catalyst at ~ 140-160 mV.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in organic carbon (OC) certification of soil as an incentive for farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices. In this context, this pilot project combines geochemical and geophysical methods to map the distribution of OC contents in agricultural fields, allowing us to detect variations in time and space. Here we demonstrated a relationship between soil OC contents estimated in the laboratory and the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured in the field. Specifically, geochemical elemental analyses were used to evaluate the OC content and relative isotopic signature in collected soil samples from a hazelnut orchard in the Emilia–Romagna region of Northeastern Italy, while the geophysical Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) method enabled the in situ mapping of the ECa distribution in the same soil field. According to the results, geochemical and geophysical data were found to be reciprocally related, as both the organic matter and soil moisture were mainly incorporated into the fine sediments (i.e., clay) of the soil. Therefore, such a relation was used to create a map of the OC content distribution in the investigated field, which could be used to monitor the soil C sequestration on small-scale farmland and eventually develop precision agricultural services. In the future, this method could be used by farmers and regional and/or national policymakers to periodically certify the farm’s soil conditions and verify the effectiveness of carbon sequestration. These measures would enable farmers to pursue Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) incentives for the reduction of CO2 emissions.

Energy efficiency in glass buildings is pivotal for achieving sustainable energy. Energy consumption is crucial in areas with diverse climatic conditions, including tropical and cold regions. In these environments, there is a notable demand for electricity due to the necessity of conditioning and heating systems to maintain resident comfort. Therefore, residents can address high energy consumption in buildings by regulating visible light and heat transmission through electrochromic windows. These windows modify their optical properties through adjustments in applied voltage. This work discussed the development of key components of electrochromic windows, including the electrochromic layer, ion-conductive layer, and electrolyte. The outstanding optical modulation of the electrochromic layer was achieved by coating a WO 3 film onto NiO film. The presentation covered the synthesis of an ion-conductive layer with a reduced band gap, a high level of oxygen vacancy, and a reduction of resistance achieved through optimization of preparation parameters, such as annealing temperature and percentage loading of Cu. The architectural configuration comprised a bi-layer film containing WO 3 coated on NiO as the electrochromic layer and a 5%Cu-doped NiO layer as the ion-conductive layer, with LiClO 4 as the electrolyte. This configuration achieved a quadlet dual-band functionality, providing clear, cool, dark, and warm modes for resident comfort. In the clear mode, with no bias voltage applied, the window transmitted visible (630nm) and near-infrared light (930nm) at approximately 79.03% and 79.33%, respectively. The cool mode, regulated by a bias voltage of -2.5V, reduced NIR transmission to 41% while maintaining visible light transmission at 74%. The dark mode, with a bias voltage of -3V, blocked visible and NIR light to 0.09% and 0.02%, respectively. These phenomena resulted from the change of optical properties in the electrochromic layer. Conversely, the ion-conductive layer enabled the warm mode with a 2V bias, reducing visible light transmission to 50.31% while maintaining overall window transparency at 69.86%. Furthermore, the electrochromic window demonstrated excellent cycle stability, sustaining functionality up to 30,000 cycles while maintaining an optical modulation of 95% compared with the first cycle. Additionally, abundant silk waste from textile industries was transformed into a green solid electrolyte used in assembling electrochromic windows. An optimal configuration was found with a 10-micron thickness and 14.5 wt% of LiClO 4 in the solid electrolyte, resulting in an excellent electrochromic window. In clear mode, the assembled window achieved a transmission of 74.67% in both visible and near-infrared regions. In the dark mode, the optical modulation difference (630 nm and 930 nm) between a solid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window and a liquid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window was less than 10%. Conversely, in cool mode, the solid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window exhibited optical modulations of 75% and 39% at wavelengths of 630 nm and 930 nm, respectively, compared to a liquid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window. Additionally, in warm mode, the optical modulation of the solid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window at 630 nm and 930 nm was 60% and 91%, respectively, compared to that of a liquid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window. Implementing these electrochromic windows for residential comfort can cause a decrease in electricity demand, which is currently the main issue of carbon dioxide emission from the conventional combustion of fossil fuels.

For many decades, fossil fuels, including gas, oil, and coal, have acted as the primary contributors to electricity generation [1]. Nevertheless, the combustion of carbon-based fuels causes substantial emissions of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), thereby precipitating climate change and adversely affecting human well-being and the environment [2]. Consequently, there is an endeavour to innovate and develop efficient and environmentally acceptable energy sources. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a pivotal half-reaction within diverse renewable energy technologies. Despite its significance, the OER is intrinsically sluggish and energy-intensive, necessitating the advancement of electrocatalysts that are both efficient and stable to facilitate this reaction [3]. In recent years, layered double hydroxides (LDH) have emerged as potential candidates for OERs due to their cost-effectiveness, versatile composition, and favourable electrocatalytic properties [4]. Ni-based LDHs, particularly NiFe-LDH, have been extensively investigated and proven to be effective OER electrocatalysts in alkaline environments [5]. However, its limited electrical conductivity hinders further enhancement of its OER catalytic activity. Meanwhile, Co-based LDHs, such as NiCo-LDH and CoFe-LDH have been proven to have excellent electrocatalytic activity [6]. In contrast to binary LDHs, the ternary LDHs, incorporating diverse transition elements can exhibit higher capacitance and contain more abundant active sites [7]. However, the utilization of LDH electrode materials is limited by their low conductivity and tendency for agglomeration. Graphene serves as an excellent substrate for catalyst immobilisation in electrocatalysis, owing to its superior electrical conductivity, high surface areas, and impressive stability [8]. Therefore, the combination of ternary LDHs, characterised by reversible redox activity, and conductive graphene is expected to represent an efficient approach for fabricating hybrid materials with enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, facilitated by the advantageous interplay between LDHs and graphene. Accordingly, in this study, trimetallic CoNiFe-LDHs were designed and grown on graphene (G) through a one-step hydrothermal approach to obtain a structure that promotes efficient charge transfer, optimizing the OER kinetics. A 2-level full-factorial model was used to determine the effect of Co (1.5, 3 and 4.5 mmol) and graphene (10, 30 and 50 mg) concentrations on the OER onset potential, which was the chosen response parameter. The independent and dependent variables were fitted to the linear model equation, using ANOVA analysis. The F-values, the ratio of noise to response, confirmed that the model is significant (p<0.05). The p-values less than 0.05 indicate the model terms, such as cobalt and graphene concentrations and their interaction, are significant, implying that the OER onset potential is strongly correlated to these parameters. The polarization curves of CoNiFe-LDH/G composites for OER are shown in Figure 1. The OER was run in triplicate using the Co 3 Ni 3 Fe 3 -LDH/G 30 (central point) to estimate the variability (0.58%). The comparison study showed that a low onset potential (1.54 V) and overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 (1.58 V) was achieved for Co 1.5 Ni 3 Fe 3 -LDH/G 10 , demonstrating that a low concentration of cobalt and graphene could make for an ideal electrocatalyst in practical applications.

Abstract Pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) offers a cost-effective means to store electrical energy for long duration by utilizing a heat pump cycle to transfer thermal energy from a low temperature reservoir (LTR) to a high temperature reservoir (HTR). The heat pump compressor, which represents a significant driver to the cost, performance and operating characteristics of the PTES system. During charging (&gt;100 MW), traditional compressor scaling charts indicate that the operating conditions needed would be best served by a multistage axial compressor. The conceptual design of a large-scale CO2 axial compressor was completed, including mean-line estimates of the compressor performance at full power conditions. At steady state, full power operation, the isentropic efficiency and mechanical efficiency of the compressor have significant impact on the cycle design and round trip efficiency of the PTES system. The results of the conceptual design were used to refine the PTES cycle design and updated operating conditions provided for further aero design optimization. An important characteristic of the PTES system is its ability to charge at variable rate, which provides significant challenges on compressor operability, especially for a compressor that will be coupled to a fixed-speed synchronous motor. Cycle studies of variable charging rate processes have been conducted, and the impact of compressor operating map characteristics explored. Based on initial modeling studies, single compressor operation can be achieved down to at least 50% of rated power, with further reductions possible depending on the characteristics of the compressor map speedlines.

Photoelectrochemistry holds the promise of directly converting sunlight to valuable chemical products since its birth over 50 years ago. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods, however, lag behind their electrochemical (EC) counterparts (which can be powered by a solar photovoltaic (PV) power source) in terms of current density, by orders of magnitude. In this work, we demonstrate that by integrating the recent achievements of the PV and EC communities (in terms of using concentrated sunlight and gas diffusion electrodes, respectively), we can achieve current densities similar to EC methods, but with lower energy input. Specifically, in this proof-of-concept study, we combined the direct PEC oxidation of glycerol (on a NiOOH co-catalyst-coated n-Si photoanode) with the dark hydrogen evolution (HER) or CO2 reduction (CO2R) in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) separated continuous-flow PEC cell. We achieved over 110 mA cm–2 photocurrent density under 10 Sun irradiation, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than those typically reported in the literature, for any of these PEC half reactions. We demonstrated that the product distribution of glycerol oxidation is notably different in PEC and EC scenarios at the same current density, and the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be suppressed in the PEC case. This approach raises new opportunities to drive electrochemical reactions with complex reaction pathways in a more selective manner even at high current densities. In the second part of my talk I will demonstrate the effect of the co-catalyst properties in tailoring the product distribution.

The rising demand for water and energy is driving the overuse of natural resources and contributing to environmental degradation. To address these challenges, the focus has shifted to low- and zero-emission technologies that utilize alternative sources of water and energy. Although such systems are commonly applied in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, facilities along transportation routes generally depend on grid connections. This study aimed to enhance operational independence and reduce environmental impacts by modernizing the Rest Area Stobierna (RAS) along Poland’s S19 expressway, part of the Via Carpatia road. A comprehensive technical, economic, and environmental analysis was conducted using HOMER Pro software (3.18.3 PRO Edition) and a simulation model based on YAS operating principles. The proposed Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) incorporates photovoltaic panels, battery storage, and a rainwater harvesting system (RWHS). Two configurations of the HRES were evaluated, a prosumer-based setup and a hybrid-island mode. Optimization results showed that the hybrid-island configuration was most effective, achieving a 61.6% share of renewable energy in the annual balance, a 7.1-year return on investment, a EUR 0.77 million reduction in Net Present Cost (NPC), and a 75,002 kg decrease in CO2 emissions over the system’s 25-year lifecycle. This study highlights the potential of integrating renewable energy and water systems to improve sustainability, reduce operational costs, and enhance service quality in road infrastructure facilities, offering a replicable model for similar contexts.

Iron and steel production, comprising approximately 95% of the global metal output annually 1 , are integral to modern industrialization, with steel serving as a critical material across various sectors, including construction and automotive industries. However, the industry's significant environmental impact is evident in the escalating CO 2 emissions observed over the last decade. Due to this massive environmental burden, efforts to develop cleaner alternatives that benefit from advantages of electrochemistry have grown. Existing and emerging electrochemical processes ideally aim for emission-free operations by utilizing energy extracted from renewable sources. While processes operating at high temperatures (using molten oxides at 1600°C) show promise, they face some challenges related to complex materials choices 2 , resulting in increased production costs. Conversely, processes operating at low temperatures using aqueous electrolytes (60-100°C) suffer from significantly lower production rates and efficiency 3,4 . In this study, we present a novel approach—moderate temperature, chloride-based molten salt electrolysis (MSE) of iron—under development at CWRU. This method combines the advantages of both high and low-temperature electrolytic processes, offering a clean, cost-effective, and practical solution for sustainable iron metal production. During chloride MSE, iron is electrodeposited from a binary (NaCl+FeCl 3 ) or ternary (LiCl+KCl+FeCl 3 ) chloride mixture at moderate temperatures ranging from 300-500°C. Electrowinning in these molten salts capitalizes on their several attractive properties, including low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, high diffusivity, high solubility for electroactive species, electrochemical stability over a wide potential range, and fast electrochemical kinetics. 5 Figure 1 illustrates the overall process flow of iron production via chloride MSE, including the upstream non-carbothermic chlorination of ore to FeCl 3 resulting in the separation of ore impurities and the subsequent electrolytic deposition process. Initial findings indicate promising outcomes for sustainable iron electrowinning at lower operational costs, attributed to the moderate temperatures, high electrolyte conductivity (1-2 S/cm), and adequate FeCl 3 concentrations (>2 M), allowing for high current efficiencies (>85%) at high electrodeposition rates (approaching 1 A/cm 2 ). Furthermore, the chloride MSE process enables the incorporation of a proprietary dimensionally stable anode (DSA) to catalyze the chlorine evolution reaction at the anode. This innovation significantly reduces cell voltage, thereby enhancing the overall process energy efficiency. Figure 1.

The green unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains 12–13 carbonic anhydrases (CAs). For a long time, the two closely related α-CAs of the periplasmic membrane CAH1 and CAH2 were considered to be the CAs with the highest CO2 hydration activity. The recombinant protein α-CA CAH3 (rCAH3) from the thylakoid lumen obtained in the present study showed more than three times higher activity compared to CAH1 and more than 11 times higher compared to previous studies with rCAH3. Long-term sustainability of the enzyme was observed at alkaline pH (&gt;8), with maintenance of half of its activity at 4 °C up to 50 days. Thermostability of rCAH3 indicated the retention of the activity at 20 °C for one hour at pH 9–10 with its ~50% decrease at pH 6–7. However, the residual activity of rCAH3 after incubation at extremely high temperature (75 °C) for 15 min led to formation of the double-hump graph with maxima at pH 6 and 9. The enzyme demonstrated high sensitivity to ethoxyzolamide and acetazolamide at nM concentrations, to Zn2+ and Cu2+ cations at 1 mM concentrations, and L-cysteine was able to completely inhibit CA activity of rCAH3 through reduction of sulfhydryl groups. Esterase activity of rCAH3 was well detected with values comparable to those of bovine CAII, but with a maximum at pH 8 instead of pH 9, which is usual for bovine CAII. The results indicated that CAH3 may be the most active CA of C. reinhardtii and that its role in the photosynthetic apparatus function could have been underestimated in previous works.

Introduction In recent years, carbon dioxide emissions are rapidly increasing, and electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to play a significant role towards achieving a carbon-neutral society with most of them utilizing Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs). The negative electrode active material of LIB is typically made of graphite, and during initial charging, the electrolyte undergoes reductive decomposition at the graphite/electrolyte interface, forming a Solid-Electrolyte Interphase (SEI). SEI exhibits lithium-ion conductivity while being electronically insulating, facilitating highly efficient charging and discharging by suppressing further electrolyte decomposition. On the other hand, the formation of SEI consumes lithium ions, resulting in irreversible capacity loss [1] . Therefore, the nature of SEI has a significant impact on LIB performance. Regarding the composition of SEI, it is known to comprise clusters of inorganic compounds such as LiF, Li 2 CO 3 , Li 2 O and organic decomposition products like polyolefins. Each component has different properties such as LiF was reported to have lower lithium-ion diffusion barrier and higher chemical stability than other inorganic components [2] . However, many aspects of the individual electrochemical roles are still unclear, and forming an excellent SEI is an important issue. Objective In this work, we focused on LiF, which is considered to be a crucial component in SEI [3] , and modelized the LiF-coated graphite by employing atomic layer deposition (ALD) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). We investigated the influence of LiF on the lithium-ion transfer reaction behavior at the graphite/electrolyte interface. Experimental Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) served as the graphite negative electrode, and atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used for the LiF coating. Regarding ALD, LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and WF 6 were used as the Li and F sources, respectively. The deposition temperature was set at 300 °C, and HOPG was deposited at various numbers of cycles (10, 30, 60, and 90 times). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the electrode after the ALD coating. Regarding electrochemical measurements, the setup utilized a three-electrode cell with HOPG as the working electrode, lithium metal as the counter and the reference electrodes. 1.0 mol dm −3 LiClO 4 /EC+DEC (1:1 vol.%) was used as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s −1 and a scanning range of 0.005 – 3 V (vs Li + /Li). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at an applied AC voltage of 5 mV and a frequency range of 100 kHz – 10 mHz. EIS measurement was also performed at different temperature with a holding potential of 0.2 V to obtain activation energy. Results and discussion For the HOPG electrode coated with LiF, XPS analysis was performed and it was confirmed that the LiF coating layer was thickening as the number of coating cycle increased. In the CV measurement results, redox peaks were observed in the range of 0 – 0.6 V, confirming that the intercalation-deintercalation reaction of lithium ion was progressing. From the Nyquist plot obtained by EIS measurements, semicircles derived from SEI were observed in the high frequency region, and semicircles derived from charge transfer resistance were observed in the medium and low frequency regions. The activation energy of the charge transfer resistance was calculated by fitting the Nyquist plot (Figure 1) obtained from the temperature-dependent measurement of EIS, and revealed that the values were 54.8 kJ mol −1 for the uncoated HOPG electrode, 55.1 kJ mol −1 for 10 coatings, and 52.8 kJ mol −1 for 30 coatings, respectively, showing no significant change. On the other hand, the activation energy slightly decreased with increasing number of depositions, which was found to be 49.7 kJ mol −1 and 50.0 kJ mol −1 in the case of 60 and 90 coatings, respectively. This suggests that when the LiF coating layer reaches a certain thickness, lithium-ion charge transfer between the electrolyte and the electrode becomes easier. Details will be discussed in the conference. References [1] Y. Tateyama, J. Comput. Chem. Jpn. , 18 (2019) 18-28. [2] M. Chen, J. Zheng, Y. Liu, O. Sheng, Z. Ju, G. Lu, T. Liu, Y. Wang, J. Nai, Q.

The paper utilized a combination of the spatial Durbin model and the difference-in-differences model (SDM+DID) to evaluate the effects of China's pilot carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS), which was implemented in some cities from 2013 to 2021. It was reported that, on average, the pilot ETS reduced CO2 emissions in ETS cities by 6.1% (local carbon abatement effect) but increased emissions in neighboring cities by 1.7% (carbon leakage effect). The paper studied an important research question and had some interesting findings. However, I have two concerns regarding this article. First, given their estimation results, the authors misinterpreted the magnitude of estimated carbon leakage and provided misleading descriptions of the policy impacts. Second, the reliability of the SDM+DID model remains unclear at this stage, so researchers should be cautious as employing this model for policy impact assessment may introduce substantial statistical biases and yield unreliable results. Below, I detail these two concerns. Misinterpretation of the Estimated Carbon Leakage EffectThe abstract of the paper states that "China's regional ETS policy contributes to a 6.1% reduction in urban CO2 emissions ... in regulated cities, causing carbon leakages that increase CO2 emissions in neighboring cities by 1.7% on average". This sentence conveys the following information to the reader: the effect of local carbon abatement (6.1% as stated in the paper) in ETS regions was greater than the effect of carbon leakage (1.7% as stated in the paper) to non-ETS regions. Then, readers may conclude that although carbon leakage occurred, the ETS mitigated aggregate CO2 emissions at the country level. However, this is not what should be inferred from the empirical results of the paper. The reported results of the paper actually indicate that ETS increased China's CO2 emissions, because the estimated carbon leakage effect was too strong.What was the origin of the 1.7% value? As stated on page 17665, the authors obtained this value by "dividing the collective indirect effects by the number of pilot cities". The estimated direct effect of ETS on CO2 emissions is −0.061, and the indirect effect is 0.637, as reported in the column "model 3" in Table 1 of the paper. Among all 281 sample cities, there were 37 ETS pilot cities and 244 non-ETS cities. Therefore, the authors calculated that 0.637/37 ≈ 0.017. However, this calculation is meaningless. The indirect effect of 0.637 should not be divided by 37 because 0.637 actually refers to the effect generated by one ETS city, not the collective effects generated by 37 ETS cities.As elucidated in spatial econometric studies such as refs (2−4) and as one can see from eqs 4–6 of ref (1), the direct effect measures the impact of a one-unit change in an independent variable of a particular region on the dependent variable of the same region; the indirect effect measures the impact of a one-unit change in an independent variable of one region on the dependent variable in the other regions. Within the context of the paper, the estimated indirect effect of 0.637 means that, on average, implementing ETS in one pilot city (i) caused the dependent variable in total [i.e., ∑j≠iln(CO2)j] aggregated over all of the other 280 cities (all j ≠ i) to increase by 0.637. Accordingly, on average, implementing ETS in one ETS city (i) caused the dependent variable [ln(CO2)j] in another specific city (j ≠ i) to increase by 0.637/280 = 0.0023. Given that there were 37 ETS pilot cities, the implementation of China's 37-city pilot ETS program caused logarithmic CO2 emissions in a typical non-ETS city to increase by 0.0023 × 37 ≈ 0.085. In an ETS city, the change in logarithmic CO2 emissions depended on both the direct effect (=–0.061) caused by local ETS policy and the carbon leakage effect (=0.0023 × 36) caused by the ETS policy in the other 36 ETS cities. Because the carbon leakage from other ETS cities outweighed the local carbon abatement effect, the 37-city pilot ETS program caused logarithmic CO2 emissions in an ETS city to increase by −0.061 + 0.0023 × 36 ≈ 0.022. Therefore, the reported results of the paper actually indicate that, in the average sense, China's 37-city pilot ETS program increased logarithmic CO2 emissions in each ETS city by 0.022 and in each non-ETS city by 0.085. Clearly, this is a bizarre finding: China's ETS program increased carbon emissions.This bizarre finding can also be derived straightforwardly by calculating the total effect of the ETS. The total effect is the sum of the estimated direct effect (−0.061) and indirect effect (0.637), which is −0.061 + 0.637 = 0.576. This large positive total effect suggests that, on average, the 37-city pilot ETS collectively caused logarithmic carbon emissions in each city to increase by 0.576/281 × 37 ≈ 0.076. It is hard to rationalize this unusual finding.In the paper, the authors did not report the total effect but rather emphasized both direct and indirect effects without adequately clarifying their implications. They misinterpreted the estimated indirect effect and summarized the policy impacts in a confusing way. This could mislead readers. Uncertainty Regarding the Reliability of the SDM+DID ModelThe surprisingly large and unrealistic carbon leakage reported in the paper reflects potential substantial statistical biases inherent in the use of SDM+DID for public policy assessment. The SDM+DID is a new model that appeared recently in some empirical studies. In the SDM+DID framework, all districts are influenced by policy interventions, making it difficult to distinguish between treatment and control groups. To the best of my knowledge, existing statistical and econometric literature has not yet formally inspected or validated SDM+DID's capacity to identify causal policy effects embedded within its complex structure. The performance of the estimator for spatial causal inference remains ambiguous.Some recent theoretical studies, such as refs (5−8), have attempted to develop new DID models with spatial spillovers and rigorously analyzed the statistical properties of the proposed estimators, but their models are considerably less intricate than SDM+DID.In summary, as the study of ref (1) relies on an empirical model whose reliability remains uncertain and the interpretation of the empirical results needs to be revised, readers should approach ref (1) with caution. Future research focusing on more rigorous analyses of spillover effects associated with ETS would be beneficial.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorDaxin Dong - Institute of Western China Economic Research, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu 611130, China; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7161-5112; Email: [email protected]NotesThe author declares no competing financial interest.The authors of the original paper confirmed they would not write a Rebuttal to this Correspondence.ReferencesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!

Ammonia is a compound that has a wide range of uses, such as fertilizers, chemical raw materials, denitrification reducing agents, carbon-free fuels, and energy carriers, and is in high demand. All of its industrial production of ammonia relies on the Haber-Bosch process. Although the Haber-Bosch process is an excellent reaction process, it requires hydrogen (H 2 ) as a raw material, so there is a desire to develop new synthetic methods that are more flexible. Various ammonia synthesis methods have been studied, but they still require H 2 as a raw material. Currently, H 2 is mostly produced by decomposing fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. Not only will this involve emitting carbon dioxide during the H 2 production, but also it will prevent us from moving away from fossil fuels. Our research group has succeeded in developing the Plasma/Liquid (P/L) reaction, a method for synthesizing ammonia that doesn’t require H 2 , for the first time in the world. The P/L reaction is a reaction that proceeds at room temperature and pressure without a catalyst. The P/L reaction involves two steps: (1) activation of nitrogen (discharge or electromagnetic wave irradiation), and (2) self-reduction reaction due to hydrogen abstraction reaction from water molecules by activated (dissociated and excited) nitrogen. In this study, we demonstrated that dissociated nitrogen (atomic nitrogen; N atom ) promotes the ammonia synthesis reaction more efficiently and selectively than excited nitrogen molecules in P/L reaction. The activated nitrogen species can be roughly divided into three states: Natom, excited nitrogen molecules (N2*), and nitrogen molecular ions (N 2 + ). Of these, N 2 * and N 2 + are also called metastable nitrogen. On the other hand, N atom is highly reactive, so the P/L reaction will proceed quickly, abstracting hydrogen atoms from water molecules. To verify ammonia synthesis in the P/L reaction by Natom, we performed quantitative analysis of N atom . Focusing on the fact that Natom has an absorption maximum in vacuum ultraviolet light, we analyzed the relationship between discharge conditions and quantitative results of generated N atom by vacuum ultra violet (VUV) spectroscopy. It has become clear that N atom can be generated with high selectivity by using a barrier discharge device that we designed and constructed, in which the discharge space is filled with titania beads. By directly connecting this discharger to the reactor that performs the P/L reaction, we constructed a connected reactor that eliminates oxygen contamination. In the P/L reaction using this reactor, ammonia was synthesized with high selectivity in the water phase, and the production of nitrate ions, which are typical by-products of nitrogen fixation reactions, was suppressed. When a P/L reaction proceeds in which ammonia is produced with high selectivity, it is necessary to consider how the oxygen in the water molecule behaves. In our previous research, using electron spin resonance (ESR) demonstrated that activated nitrogen species abstracts hydrogen atoms from water molecules by forming hydroxyl radicals (·OH) after the P/L reaction. In this case, we also show that nitrates are formed by the reaction of ·OH with activated nitrogen species. However, when we performed ESR analysis on the P/L reaction which is dominated by Natom, we found that ·OH wasn’t present. This suggests that N atom abstracts two hydrogen atoms from the water molecule, leaving only the oxygen atom in the water phase. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the behavior of this oxygen atoms. Therefore, we collected gas after the P/L reaction and performed gas analysis. As a result, it was revealed that NO and H 2 were generated in the gas phase. Based on the above results, we considered that the following reactions proceed in the P/L reaction in which N atom production selectivity was improved by PbDBD. N atom + H 2 O → NH 2 + O 2N atom + H 2 O → 2NH + O N atom + O → NO N atom + O → NO + H 2 What is noteworthy is that H 2 gas can be generated in parallel with ammonia synthesis through the P/L reaction. The above results indicate that in the P/L reaction using PbDBD, ammonia can be synthesized with 100 % selectivity in the water phase, and H 2 and NO gas can be generated in addition to ammonia in the gas phase. As mentioned earlier, ammonia has a wide range of uses and is in high demand. NO gas can be reacted with water to synthesize nitric acid. H 2 can of course be used as energy. We successfully demonstrate that three useful compounds can be synthesized at once from nitrogen and water through the P/L reaction.

Soil salinization is an important stress factor that limits plant growth and yield. Increased salinization is projected to affect more than 50% of all arable land by 2050. In addition, the growing demand for food, together with the increase in the world population, forces the need to seek salt-tolerant crops. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is an Andean crop of high importance, due to its nutritional characteristics and high tolerance to different abiotic stresses. The aim of this work is to determine the physiological, anatomical, and biochemical salt-tolerance mechanisms of a salt-tolerant (Vikinga) and a salt-sensitive (Regalona) quinoa variety. Plants were subjected to salinity stress for 15 days, starting at 100 mM NaCl until progressively reaching 400 mM NaCl. Physiological, anatomical, and biochemical parameters including growth, chlorophyll content, quantum yield of PSII (ϕPSII), gas exchange, stomatal density, size, and lipid peroxidation (via malondialdehyde, MDA) were measured. Results show that chlorophyll content, ϕPSII, and MDA were not significantly reduced under saline stress in both varieties. The most stress-affected process was the CO2 net assimilation, with an up to 60% reduction in both varieties, yet Vikinga produced higher dry weight than Regalona due to the number of leaves. The stomatal densities increased under salinity for both varieties, with Regalona the one showing higher values. The averaged stomatal size was also reduced under salinity in both varieties. The capacity of Vikinga to generate higher dry weight is a function of the capacity to generate greater amounts of leaves and roots in any condition. The stomatal control is a key mechanism in quinoa’s salinity tolerance, acquiring higher densities with smaller sizes for efficient management of water loss and carbon assimilation. These findings highlight the potential of Vikinga for cultivation in temperate salinized environments during winter, such as Deltas and lowlands where rice is grown during summer.

With the growth of global energy demand and the reduction of fossil fuels, the search for clean energy has become particularly urgent. Hydrogen energy, due to its cleanliness and high efficiency, is regarded as an ideal alternative energy source. Methane catalytic cracking technology, as an effective way to produce hydrogen, has significant economic and environmental value.This study focuses on the application of vanadium-based catalysts in biogas cracking for hydrogen production. Vanadium-based catalysts have shown great potential in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons due to their cost-effectiveness, environmental compatibility, high catalytic activity, and stability. An innovative one-step method was used to prepare Ni-VC/TiO2 composite catalysts, and the impact of vanadium carbide (VC) content on the performance of the catalyst was studied. The addition of VC not only optimized the catalyst&#039;s active surface area but also enhanced its conductivity and electron transfer capability, thereby improving catalytic efficiency.Experimental results indicate that an increase in VC content leads to a decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalyst, but an increase in pore size, which is beneficial for the adsorption and diffusion of gas molecules. Moreover, the reaction temperature has a significant effect on the performance of the catalyst: at 500°C, the 10Ni-5VC/TiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest stability and hydrogen production rate. However, at higher temperatures, the methane conversion rate and hydrogen yield will drop sharply due to the increased graphitization of coke, which accelerates the deactivation of the catalyst.Through regeneration experiments, we found that using CO2 as an activator at 600°C can effectively restore the activity of the catalyst. However, as the number of regenerations increases, the performance of the catalyst gradually decreases, which is related to the increase in Ni grain size and the formation of surface amorphous coke. SEM and TEM analysis showed that coke mainly exists in the form of filamentous carbon, which affects the long-term stability of the catalyst.

The article examines the impact of Industry 4.0 concept on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, particularly Goal № 9 «Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure». The theoretical foundations of Industry 4.0 concept are analyzed, with systematization and generalization of definitions by leading scientists, based on which the author's interpretation of the term is proposed. Key components of Industry 4.0 are identified, including cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, robotics, and additive manufacturing, which contribute to achieving sustainable development goals. The relationship between the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies and the realization of specific objectives of Goal №9 is investigated, including the development of quality infrastructure, modernization of industrial enterprises, stimulation of innovative activity, and ensuring equal access to digital technologies. A practical example of Industry 4.0 technology implementation is presented through the creation of a «smart» office model for IT enterprises in Ukraine using Cisco Packet Tracer tools. A conceptual model of such an office is developed, incorporating various Internet of Things devices to optimize energy consumption and improve operational efficiency. A detailed economic analysis of potential resources and cost savings from implementing the proposed technologies across Ukraine's entire IT sector is conducted. Calculations demonstrated the possibility of annual savings of approximately 50 million hryvnias and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 25,000 tons of CO2 equivalent when implementing smart office technologies in 2,500 IT companies nationwide. It is substantiated that Industry 4.0 also contributes to achieving other sustainable development goals, particularly in the areas of energy efficiency, environmental protection, and economic growth. Major challenges in ensuring equal access to Industry 4.0 technologies are identified, and solutions are proposed through expanded international support and the creation of a favorable political climate for domestic innovation development. Based on the conducted research, conclusions are formulated regarding the key role of Industry 4.0 in achieving sustainable development goals and the necessity of coordinated efforts at global and national levels to maximize its benefits.

A fuel cell is a generator that produces electric power by the hydrogen oxidation reaction at a fuel electrode and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at an air electrode. A fuel cell is a clean energy conversion system that produces only water without emission of carbon dioxide. However, Pt (an expensive precious metal) is used as a catalyst of a fuel cell. Reduction of Pt loading in the catalyst or development of alternative materials of Pt is important for the widespread of fuel cells as a primary energy source in the future. Finding out materials that have higher ORR activity is a major target of the development of fuel cells. TiO 2 , a more abundant resource compared to Pt, is one of the alternative materials of Pt. The ORR activity of TiO 2 can be enhanced by metal doping [1]. Theoretical calculation predicts that doping of Pd and Rh reduces the overpotential of the ORR to zero [2]. The ORR activity of Nb doped TiO 2 electrodes depends on the crystal orientation as follows: TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (111) < TiO 2 (110) [3]. However, the real surface structure and adsorbed species for enhancing the ORR activity have not been determined on TiO 2 single crystal electrodes in electrochemical environments. In this study, we have studied the adsorbates on the low index planes of TiO 2 single crystals in 0.1 M HClO 4 using nanoparticle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (NPSERS). We assigned adsorbed species using DFT calculation. 1%Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (100), TiO 2 (110) and TiO 2 (111) were annealed and chemically polished with a 30w% HF solution. Au nanoparticles of about 50 nm were dispersed on the single crystal surfaces. Raman spectra were measured by stepping the potential positively with the interval of 0.1 V. The electrolyte solution was 0.1 M HClO 4 . All the potentials were referred to RHE. NPSERS bands were found at 580 cm -1 and 360 cm -1 in Ar saturated HClO 4 . The onset potentials of the bands were 0.4, 0.6, and 0.7 V(RHE) on TiO 2 (100), TiO 2 (110) and TiO 2 (111), respectively. The Au-O stretching vibration of Au nanoparticles appears from 1.4 V(RHE) at 590 cm -1 [4]. Thus the observed bands originate from surface adsorbates of TiO 2 . The band at 580 cm -1 was shifted 15 cm -1 to lower frequency in D 2 O solution, showing that the band is an adsorbed species containing hydrogen. On the other hand, the band at 360 cm -1 is an oxygen species such as Ti-O because no deuterium isotope effect was observed in D 2 O solution. DFT calculation showed that symmetrical stretching vibrations of Ti-OH-Ti (bridged OH) and Ti-OD-Ti locate at 577 and 564 cm -1 , respectively. Ti-O-H out-of-plane bending vibration and in-plane bending vibration also locate at 350 cm -1 and 680 cm -1 , respectively, which are close to the above-mentioned 577 cm -1 according to the DFT calculation using the bridged OH model. However, these two vibrations shift more than 100 cm -1 by the substitution with deuterium, which contradicts the experimental result. Other candidates of the adsorbed species containing hydrogen are OH and OOH on 5-coordinated titanium. However, TiO 2 (100), which has no 5-coordinated titanium, also gave the NPSERS band at 580 cm -1 . Therefore, the band at 580 cm -1 is assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of Ti-OH-Ti (bridged OH). The onset potential of 580 cm -1 band increases as TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (110) ≤ TiO 2 (111), whereas the order of the ORR activity is TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (111) < TiO 2 (110). No correlation is found between the onset potential and the ORR activity. This result suggests that adsorbed water, which cannot be observed with NPSERS, is involved in the ORR activity.

More efficient usage of shale gas reserves and natural gas resources will allow for higher olefin yields and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a direct pathway for converting methane to ethylene at temperatures >700 °C. OCM catalysts preferably avoid CO x products and limit coke formation on the catalyst. Often, catalysts are analyzed via computationally expensive DFT computations in combination with experimental results leading to long lead times for catalyst development. Perovskite oxide catalysts are useful for OCM due to their flexible bond networks and varied properties (conductivity, selectivity, surface area) based on synthesis/doping. This work aims to illustrate the utility of the bond-valence bond-length model (ionic model) 1 ,2 in conjunction with gas reduction experiments for rapid structure evaluation of the co-doped perovskite BaMg 0.33 Nb 0.67-x Fe x O 3-δ (BMNF, x=0.17,0.25,0.33). This perovskite catalyst has previously been adopted as a CO 2 sensing material 3 and an active/stable anode for the electrochemical oxidative coupling of methane 4 (E-OCM). Further evaluation of this perovskite by our group illustrated the unique stability of ionic Fe into the BMNF while performing the oxidative coupling of methane 5 . This work delves into the crystal structure of the BMNF material as well as its chemical stability validated using a much more facile computational methodology featuring the bond-valence bond-length method. XPS, XRD, and reduction/oxidation high temperature cycling are utilized in conjunction to illustrate the stabilizing mechanisms for cations within the BMNF perovskite when exposed to highly reducing environments.

Anthropogenic climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-based processes highlights the importance for alternative synthesis pathways for platform chemicals. Electrochemical CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution offer sustainable options for platform chemical synthesis. However, pairing of the reduction reactions is often done with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which consumes a major share of the total energy demand without contributing to value creation. In contrast, the partial methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is an energy-efficient alternative to OER, yielding formate as a valuable product. While MOR is often studied in terms of high Faraday efficiencies, little attention is paid to conversion and yield regarding paired processes. In this work, we investigate the oxidation of methanol to formate and examine the influence of different reaction parameters including current density, temperature, flow rate, and electrolyte to increase the yield and conversion towards industrially relevant levels. Hierarchically structured CuO foam electrodes (5x5cm²) were employed as the MOR anode. To this end, electrochemically deposited dendrites on a fine-pored copper foam were subsequently oxidized to provide a large surface area for the MOR. The electrode was positioned within an electrochemical cell to ensure continuous flow through the foam, thereby utilizing the high electrode surface area. A defined electrolyte volume was recirculated through the cell and product analysis was conducted via Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for calculation of methanol conversion and Faradaic efficiency (FE) to formate. Increasing the current density from 50 to 200 mA/cm² led to a decrease in the initial FE and final conversion from 92% to 76% and 88% to 85%, respectively. Conversely, elevating temperature from 25 °C to 55 °C increased FE from 83% to 93% and conversion from 74% to 83%. A raise of the electrolyte flow rate from 25 to 100 mL/min showed no impact on FE and conversion. Change in electrolyte composition revealed a negative correlation between KOH concentration and FE, decreasing from 91% to 64% with a rise from 1 M to 4 M KOH. Conversely, increasing MeOH concentration from 0.5 M to 2 M enhanced FE from 71% to 92%. Finally, MOR was paired with alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using two different membrane types, either a bipolar membrane (BPM) or an anion exchange membrane (AEM). Operating at optimized conditions resulting from the previous investigations (100 mA/cm², 55 °C, 50 mL/min, 2 M KOH, and 1 M MeOH), both setups achieved over 90% methanol conversion before the FE dropped to zero. The BPM approach exhibited slightly higher initial FE (over 95%) compared to the AEM approach (over 86%), with respective yields of 70% and 68% at anodic potentials of 1.49 V and 1.33 V. This study provides valuable insights into the influence of reaction conditions on methanol oxidation to formate regarding industrially relevant conversions. Furthermore, the study successfully demonstrates two concepts of pairing HER as the value-adding cathode reaction with MOR as an additional value-adding anode reaction for future applications.

The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) for chemical production using renewable electricity offers attractive “carbon-neutral” and “carbon-negative” mitigation strategies for greenhouse emission. CO 2 RR to C 2 + chemicals, the compounds containing two or more carbons, represent a particularly interesting topic from both fundamental research as well as practical application points of view. For example, ethanol, ethylene, propanol, etc. are among the most produced chemicals by the industry and are widely used for various applications. Distributive CO 2 RR by recycling locally emitted CO 2 to manufacture these chemicals for the local consumption could substantially reduce the cost of CO 2 storage and transport while producing economic income. Electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 involves a fundamental reaction step – proton couple electron transfer (PCET). CO 2 RR to CO or formic acid requires only two PCET steps, rendering them highly effective with fast kinetics. CO 2 RR to C 2 + chemicals are significantly more challenging due to the rapid escalation of required PCET steps (for example, 12 for ethanol and 18 for propanol), as well as the C-C bond coupling reaction. These increased PCET steps substantially complicate the electrochemical reaction coordinate, leading to a high probability of branching reactions, which lower the single product Faradaic efficiency (FE). [1] At Argonne, we developed an amalgamated lithium metal (ALM) synthesis method of preparing highly selective and active electrocatalysts through collaboration with Northern Illinois U. For example, we derived a Cu-based CO 2 RR catalyst that yielded > 90% FE for conversion of CO 2 to ethanol [2]. More recently, we expanded the approach to metal Sn and prepared a family of CO 2 RR catalysts with Sn size varying from single atom, ultra-small clusters to nano-crystallite. High single-product FE s and low onset potential of CO 2 conversion to acetate ( FE = 90 % @ -0.6 V), ethanol ( FE = 92% @ - 0.4 V), and formate ( FE = 91% @ -0.6 V) were achieved over the catalysts of different active site dimensions. [3] In this presentation, we will discuss in detail on the CO 2 conversion mechanism behind these highly selective, size-modulated p -block element (Sn) catalysts. We will elucidate the catalytic reaction path using first-principle computation, advanced material characterizations, together with kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study. To our surprise, we found that PCET reaction paths over these catalysts can be completely altered by switching from H 2 O to D 2 O in the electrolyte, an important experimental observation to support future theoretical exploration on the transition state theory of CO 2 RR.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">The aim of this study is to compare possible approaches that support the goal of achieving a carbon-neutral society in the mobility sector, with a specific focus on the two-wheel segment of the mobility sector. One of the key considerations in the mobility sector is the transition from a fossil fuel-based energy mix to a more renewable one. While there are numerous options available for achieving a carbon-neutral society in the four-wheel scenario, the two-wheel sector presents a different challenge due to a smaller number of available options. This study introduces a new comparison between full electric, gasoline, and ethanol-powered two-wheeled vehicles. It suggests that ethanol is a feasible solution for reducing carbon emissions in the two-wheel sector. The study includes an analysis of CO2 emissions for two-wheel vehicles using a life cycle approach, focusing on the technologies of full electric motorcycles, motorcycles with flex-fuel internal combustion engines running on gasoline, and motorcycles with flex-fuel internal combustion engines running on ethanol. The energy mix of a country, which serves as a reference for this study, directly impacts emissions from the mobility sector. Therefore, the analysis focuses on Brazil, China, and India, which represent significant markets in the two-wheel segment and are crucial for decarbonization efforts. The findings of the analysis indicate that motorcycles powered by ethanol can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 56% compared to gasoline-powered motorcycles and by 52%, 48%, and 37% compared to electric motorcycles in countries with emission-intensive energy sources such as China, India, and the United States, respectively. However, in countries with more renewable electricity sources, such as Brazil and France, full electric motorcycles showed slight advantages. The study also suggests that, based on the Brazilian experience with flex-fuel two-wheeled vehicles, replacing 60% of the current gasoline-powered fleet with ethanol-powered vehicles could lead to a reduction of around 34% of all emissions associated with the two-wheeler sector in China and India. The conclusions drawn from this study provide valuable insights for comparative discussions on the decarbonization of the two- and four-wheel segments. These insights can be instrumental in making strategic decisions and promoting the development of alternative sectoral solutions.</div></div>

Millet is one of the oldest cereal grains, used for several centuries in Asia and Africa. Its ease of growth in adverse environmental conditions and with minimum agricultural inputs made it a popular choice before the advent of the green revolution. However, the green revolution's recent focus on nutritional insecurity has led to a renewed interest in calorie-rich cereal grains like millet. Millet is not only a nutritious grain providing macronutrients and micronutrients, but it also contains health-promoting components such as phenolic compounds, dietary fiber, and resistant starch, benefiting patients with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular ailments, and celiac disease. In recent years, the approach of biofortification has further guaranteed nutritional enhancement in food crops, including millets, by increasing the concentration of nutrients or reducing the level of anti-nutrients to improve bioavailability. Added to its short life cycle are other advantages, such as drought resistance, durability, insect resistance, and pest resistance. The cultivation of millet offers several environmental benefits, including efficient utilization of water reserves, reduced emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), CO2 reduction from the atmosphere, and maintenance of soil health and fertility. The Himalayan range in northern India, spanning from west to east across the states of Jammu & Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, is known for its traditional millet-based foods, utilizing pearl millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, sorghum, etc., for their food and beverage requirements. In fact, the influence of the Green Revolution in these areas has been minimal due to environmental restrictions on large-scale production of wheat and rice. These Himalayan communities continue to widely use the millet crop, well-adapted to these cold, semi-arid regions, as food, fodder, and beverage for their domestic, cultural, and religious practices. We present a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of millet as a nutritious resource in the rural communities of the Himalayan ranges in this review. This paper details the different types of millet-based foods and beverages and the traditional practices used for their production in these rural areas. Promotion of the cultivation and consumption of millet grains can help achieve sustainable development of these rural areas, eliminating hidden hunger, malnutrition, and poverty, and thus attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as established by the United Nations (UN). These high-altitude millet populations are part of natural biodiversity which have been subjected to environmental interaction over hundreds of years, and thus, hold potential for revealing new germplasm if explored. Overall, the rural communities of the Himalayan regions hold a traditional treasure in their millet-based foods, which also alleviates the present-day problem of nutritional insecurity.

Greenhouse gas emissions and following global climate change problems are the most important human-being facing issues. The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is one of the most promising processes to obtain value-added hydrocarbons from carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O), and the process is being actively investigated as an alternative way to conventional hydrocarbon production by fossil resources. Among the electrocatalysts for CO 2 RR, copper (Cu) species are unique and most studied material group because of their capability of producing C 2+ species, such as ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) and propanol, through forming C-C bonding. Especially C 2 H 4 is the most highly demanded and profitable product [1] . Porous structure of electrodes is reported to be advantageous to CO 2 RR because it enables enrichment of reactants, CO 2 molecules, and intermediates [2–5] . Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a hydrophobic polymer, has been reported to be beneficial to increase the FE towards C 2+ products [6] and suppressing competitive reaction, hydrogen production [7,8] . In this study, we prepared PTFE modified porous Cu electrodes and investigated the influence of each factor and their synergistic effect on CO 2 RR activity. As a result, the introduction of porous structure increased FE to C 2 H 4 (FE(C 2 H 4 )) and suppressed both carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) production. Further modification by PTFE enhanced FE(C 2 H 4 ) and improved durability significantly. Porous Cu electrode was prepared by de-alloying process [9] . First, Cu and Al metals were co-sputtered to form CuAl alloy on gas-diffusion layer (GDL, MFK-A, Mitsubishi Chemical) coated with micro porous layer (MPL). The samples were etched using 5 wt.% hydrochloric acid for approximately 20 minutes to remove Al from the alloy and obtained porous Cu electrodes. CO 2 RR test was carried out in flow cell with gas-diffusion electrode (GDE), the electrocatalyst coated GDL, as a cathode under applied current density of 300 mA cm -2 . Both gas phase products and liquidous products were quantified by gas chromatography (GC). Structural characterizations using scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed that porous Cu structure was successfully formed, and porous Cu electrodes exhibited higher FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 48%, and lower FE toward CO (FE(CO)) of 6% and FE toward CH 4 (FE(CH 4 )) of less than detection limit, while smooth Cu electrode showed FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 45%, FE(CO) of 12%, FE(CH 4 ) of 0.6%, respectively. However, FE(C 2 H 4 ) started to decrease 6 hours after the start of the reaction and decreased to 12% after 24 hours reaction. This could be caused by GDE soaking to electrolyte. To overcome these issues, we next investigated PTFE added porous Cu electrodes. PTFE was introduced into the porous Cu layer by electrostatic spray [10] .The introduction of PTFE further improved FE(C 2 H 4 ) from 48% to 55% and demonstrated over 80% of FE towards valuable C 2+ products at 300 mA cm -2 . PTFE introduction enhanced durability and resulted in FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 55% for over 24 hours. References [1] S. Nitopi, E. Bertheussen, S. B. Scott, X. Liu, A. K. Engstfeld, S. Horch, B. Seger, I. E.

We have developed a novel interdigitated flow field for polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers (proton exchange membrane water electrolysis cells) for ground and space applications1),2), which are supposed to work in a hybrid system with a low temperature Sabatier reactor for effective use of heat3),4). This design separates the oxygen and liquid water inside the anode of the cell. It dispenses with water circulators and external separators that use natural or centrifugal buoyancy. To date, we have developed a numerical model for optimizing cell structures. Finite element modeling (COMSOL Multiphysics) of water transport is three-dimensionally conducted for the anode porous transport layer coated with a hydrophobic microporous layer (MPL) (SIGRACET 29BC, SGL Carbon Inc.) assembled with the interdigitated flow field. The MPL can separate the evolved oxygen gas and pressurized liquid water owing to capillary pressure5). The electrochemical kinetic parameters for the model are determined using electrochemical impedance spectra. We model the current densities and the current ratio between the reactant liquid water and water vapor at the interface between the MPL and catalyst layer (CL)6). The model involves the fractional bubble coverage of the produced oxygen gas at the CL, as well as liquid water saturation and liquid water permeability in the MPL7). The vapor evaporating from the liquid water in the MPL is assumed to be mixed with the evolved oxygen for diffusive water transport. The volumetric evaporation rate was estimated from experimental data8).

To enable a future society based on sun and wind energy, the transformation of electricity into chemical energy in form of fuels is crucial. Electrolysis offers a promising solution, achieving this transformation by splitting water. At the anode, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) produces protons and electrons that are used at the cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to generate hydrogen fuel. While hydrogen is the desired product, oxygen has limited economic value. From a techno-economic standpoint, a more attractive approach is hybrid water electrolysis, which replaces the OER with value-added oxidation reactions of abundant organic feedstocks. However, significant challenges stand in the way of widespread adoption of hybrid water electrolysis for large-scale industrial applications. This work provides a critical analysis of these hurdles, delving deeper into each aspect: Higher Kinetic Overpotentials for Organic Oxidation Reactions: Compared to the well-established OER, organic oxidation reactions generally have a lower energy consumption, but generally necessitate greater overpotentials to overcome kinetic limitations. Addressing this challenge requires the development of novel electrocatalysts that can significantly reduce the activation energy for organic oxidation reactions, bringing their kinetic performance closer to that of the OER. Limited Availability and Product Demand of Feedstocks and Products: The organic feedstocks suitable for these reactions may be less abundant or have a lower market demand compared to hydrogen (or even CO2 reduction). This scarcity or limited economic value of the organic substrates and products can potentially hinder the overall economic viability of hybrid water electrolysis. Extensive research into utilizing readily available and sustainable organic feedstocks is crucial. Additionally, exploring and developing markets for the products generated from these oxidation reactions would be necessary for widespread adoption. Additional Purification Needs: The products formed during organic oxidation reactions might require further purification steps to meet the specifications required for downstream applications. These additional purification processes add complexity and increase the cost associated with hybrid water electrolysis. Developing selective electrocatalysts that generate the desired products in high purity could significantly alleviate this challenge. High Activity: The catalysts should possess a high intrinsic activity for the target organic oxidation reactions, ensuring fast reaction rates and maximizing product yield. Selectivity for the Desired Products: Indiscriminate oxidation of the organic feedstock can lead to the formation of undesired byproducts, reducing the efficiency and necessitating complex downstream separations. Therefore, catalysts with high selectivity for the targeted products are essential. Long-Term Stability: Electrocatalysts must maintain their activity and selectivity over extended periods under operating conditions. Degradation of the catalysts can occur due to various factors, including chemical and structural transformations during operation. Developing electrocatalysts with exceptional long-term stability is paramount for the practical application of hybrid water electrolysis. By outlining these challenges, we aim to stimulate discussion and guide research efforts within the academic community. Addressing these critical aspects is essential to pave the way for the successful implementation of hybrid water electrolysis at an industrial scale, ultimately enabling a sustainable energy future.

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) over copper gas diffusion electrode (Cu-GDE) has the potential to generate multi carbon products (C2+ such as ethylene and ethanol) with renewable electricity at a commercial scale [1-3]. To unlock the potential, selectivity towards a desired product with acceptable current densities are a must [1-3]. Efforts are being made to understand catalyst structure, activity and selectivity relationships by different techniques, including a few in situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies [3-7]. However, there is no consensus on the active and selective site/phase composition of copper for ethylene production. On the one hand, the occurrence of only metallic Cu during the reaction is reported [3-7] while on the other hand, some of these studies find no correlation between the metallic Cu and eCO 2 R products distribution [3,4]. Differently, the occurrence of Cu(OH) 2 and Cu 2 O (along with metallic Cu) during the reaction is also reported [5,6]. The discrepancies could be a result of varied experimental conditions and in situ / operando cell designs [3-7]. The latter could play a key role in obtaining reliable structure-activity data [8]. The observations emphasise the need for targeted and cell specific operando spectroscopic studies to unravel structure, activity and selectivity relationships [3]. In the present study we report a novel operando XAS GDE flow cell with a three-phase system (i.e., gaseous CO 2 , liquid electrolyte and solid catalyst) to conduct experiments in a transmission mode that probes the Cu-GDE from surface to bulk and provides information on the copper oxidation and coordination states during the reaction. It would, however, not be able to distinguish between the surface and bulk composition [3] and hence complementary surface sensitive quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed to probe copper dynamics on the Cu-GDE surface [9]. The data are then complemented by Raman spectroscopy that monitors not only the surface adsorbed species but also the evolution of copper speciation (even very amorphous species) during the reaction [10]. The dynamic behaviour of copper during the reaction is captured by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. Linear combination analyses (LCA) show that within the first 20 min of the reaction, copper is only in oxidised state (mainly CuO and minority Cu 2 O), which is corroborated by the quasi in situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS). The majority of CuO is reduced to Cu 2 O (44%) and metallic Cu (44%) at 30 min of the reaction. The metallic Cu content increased to 77% at 60 min of the reaction, however remarkably the remainder (23%) of the copper is in the Cu 2+ oxidation state. The latter is not detected by quasi in situ XPS that instead shows copper only in < 2+ oxidation state, potentially as metallic Cu. This implies that the bulk composition is different from the surface composition which is further confirmed by the quasi in situ Raman that shows the presence of copper oxides, Cu(OH) 2 and CO adsorbed metallic Cu at 60 min. Based on the complementary spectroscopic data, eCO 2 R data will be correlated with the catalyst structure dynamics and structure-activity relations will be discussed. References: S. Nitopi, E.

Although we are all dedicated to conducting high-quality, cutting-edge research in the basic and applied biomedical sciences, it is important to acknowledge the environmental impact of our work. The biomedical research sector is a significant contributor to the production of non-degradable plastics, as well as toxic and chemical waste (Urbina et al., 2015). Additionally, this sector demands substantial energy, not only for experimental work but also for computing, communication and data science activities. We are now facing emerging health and climate challenges, including increased pollution, the pervasive presence of microplastics and a rise in climate-related health issues that stem, in part, from our research. In recognition of our responsibility to future generations, it is imperative that we work actively to minimize our environmental footprint (Freese et al., 2024). Efforts need to be made in all sectors, including the biomedical research sector, to meet the UK's net zero CO2 emissions target by 2050. With this in mind, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI; one of the major funding agencies in the UK) recently co-produced a concordat for the Environmental Sustainability of Research and Innovation Practice (https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/environmental-sustainability-concordat), hosted by the Wellcome. A number of major funding bodies, such as Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Wellcome, and universities are signatories. Some UK funding bodies, such as Wellcome and CRUK, have also recently started asking the labs of grant holders to reduce the environmental impact of their research, and we will likely see other funding bodies following suit.Until very recently, most sustainability efforts have been driven by grassroots actions from a few labs (Dobbelaere et al., 2022). However, best sustainability practices are often not widely adopted because they remain for individual labs to develop and implement. This requires a considerable amount of time and knowledge from researchers. In addition, the exchange of best practices is largely through word-of-mouth between interested labs, although online forums and websites are now appearing (Box 1). Additionally, new practices and methods might raise suspicion and resistance if they have not been tested up to the exacting specifications required for high-quality science.Box 1. Online forums and blogsThe Company of Biologists' sustainability initiative. Launched in 2020, this initiative provides blog posts on the topic of sustainability. The Company of Biologists also offers grants to support sustainable conferencing events and a tree-planting scheme for every paper published. https://www.biologists.com/sustainability-hub/The 'lab concious' blog. This site offers advice and tips on sustainability, such as recycling and reuse, and provides information on environmentally friendly lab supplies. It also has a list of useful websites from other green groups. https://www.labconscious.com/blogThe Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework (LEAF). Developed by UCL, this provides a framework to implement sustainability practices in research labs, with criteria associated with three levels of sustainability in labs. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sustainable/take-action/staff-action/leaf/take-part-leafMy Green Lab. A US-based organization that provides a blog, a podcast, information and a program with certification for labs to become more sustainable. https://www.mygreenlab.org/Lab sustainability award from EMBO. EBMO recently launched this award to recognize pioneering progress in sustainability efforts in research. EMBO also publishes articles on sustainability in research. https://www.embo.org/the-embo-communities/embo-lab-sustainability-award/University of Edinburgh sustainability website. The University of Edinburgh provides a comprehensive website offering information, training and advice on sustainable topics in the context of education and research. https://www.ed.ac.uk/sustainabilityThe Sustainable European Laboratories network. This offers information and best practices on sustainability in research in Europe. It aims to support the establishment of green initiatives and influence policymakers and key stakeholders to make a positive impact on lab practices. https://sels-network.orgIt is becoming clear that research labs will be most successful in becoming more sustainable if all stakeholders are involved and supported (Woolston, 2024; Winter et al., 2023). Research institutions, universities and funders have an important role to play here in advising and supporting the research workforce, whether they are office or lab based, on how we can reduce our carbon footprint. At the moment, any efforts in making our workflows more sustainable usually come on top of the current existing workload of research staff. Sustainability workflows also have an upfront cost that needs to be met by funders: for example, although the reuse of lab consumables (such as glass pipettes and flasks) is considered to be more sustainable than using disposable or recyclable consumables, the costs associated with washing and reusing glass flasks or pipettes are often higher than those associated with the use of disposable counterparts (owing to the staff costs involved in running a washing-up facility). This highlights the crucial need for continued funding of core facilities within research institutions. In addition, research labs consume more energy than offices, due to their particular requirements for ventilation, negative pressure and temperature control. Research institutions therefore need to be forward thinking when designing new research buildings to make them more energy efficient (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/29413.pdf) and mindful of the environment. Overall, all stakeholders – from those working in the lab to those providing funding and infrastructure – have an important role to play.The lab users – postdocs, PhD students, research staff – who work day-to-day in the lab will have a good idea of what workflows can be changed to reduce the energy used and the waste generated. There could be discussions within a group and/or a committee setup representing the individual groups within an institute or department. The decision-making and implementation process works best when all relevant parties feel engaged. The goals and targets must be clear, measurable and achievable for everyone. Setting targets, monitoring the reduction in energy, plastics or waste and having a reward system helps recognize people's efforts and contributions. It can also motivate people to further reduce their carbon footprint.Collective action and the sense of working towards a common goal can also provide a focal point for a department or institution, bringing people together. Websites and noticeboards hosted by the research institution, unit or department are useful ways to communicate initiatives and information both locally and more widely with labs at other institutions.Although it is important that people in the lab make their research practices more sustainable, there is regular lab turnover such that information or training might get lost. The principal investigator, however, will often have a good overview of the lab's history and a deeper understanding of the health and safety measures in place and how compatible they are with making workflows more sustainable. Even though they might spend less time in the lab, they might notice practices that can be improved. Waste reduction and sustainability should not be done at the expense of safety, but instead should work together to make our research programs more environmentally friendly.Additionally, some researchers and early-career scientists joining the lab might also suffer from eco-anxiety, which can cause mental health issues (Pearson, 2024; Lawrance, 2024) and could affect laboratory practices negatively. Supporting individuals to channel that anxiety and turn it into action towards sustainability goals, within the lab or department, will have a positive impact on the local research community and is a powerful way to look after everyone's mental health.Changing people's habits is difficult. For people to get engaged, the new workflow must be easy to implement. Ideally, the long-term goals and cost-benefits have to be clear. It also helps if there is training, a reward system, and an explicit long-term vision that mobilizes staff.Of course, you might think that if it is only your lab doing this, then the reduction in carbon footprint will be negligible. However, if many labs worldwide start adopting more ecological workflows, the impact will become significant. Below, are some easy tips that can help you and your lab get started: 1.Plan your experiment! The most efficient and sustainable way to carry out an experiment is to design it well, so that it works first time.2.Switch the temperature of the ULT freezer from −80°C to −70°C. This saves around 28% energy consumption (https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/efficient_ult_freezer_storage.pdf). Organize your freezers and make an inventory of their contents to minimize the time they are open for when searching for a reagent. Not only will you save energy, you will also save time and reduce frustration! Regularly defrost the freezers so they consume less energy.3.Put your equipment on a timer, so that it switches on and off automatically when possible, and switch off non-sensitive equipment in the evening. Ensure all lab members switch off non-essential equipment when they have finished using it.4.Label bottles (e.g. of solutions) with their contents, the date made and the person who made it. Record any chemicals that are ordered and the date they are received. This helps with managing the chemicals in the lab/institution and facilitates correct waste disposal. Work with your safety office to provide clear and accessible information about waste disposal. Make a list of commonly used lab chemicals and their waste disposal routes and make this list easily accessible to all researchers. A list of chemicals that cannot be disposed of via the sink should be posted in the lab. For some substances, only small volumes of these should be disposed of via sinks and they should be diluted.5.Use glass rather than plastic pipettes and flasks where possible. This significantly reduces the CO2 equivalent footprint (Farley and Nicolet, 2023), and the cost of glass washing is lower than the cost of using single-use plastic, once washing-up facilities are in place.6.Share and fix equipment within your department. Take steps to make equipment accessible to multi-users. The benefits are that the costs for maintenance and repair can be shared. A booking system can facilitate the coordination and tracking of users.7.Inactivate biological material rather than autoclave it. All biological waste is incinerated for biosafety reasons, so autoclaving is often unnecessary. Replacing autoclaving with inactivation where possible saves energy.8.Reuse should always be the top choice, with recycling the second option. Much of the packaging used for life science consumables can be reused, with some providers allowing returns of polystyrene (Winter et al., 2023) and packages for this purpose. Distributors are also moving away from plastic and polystyrene packing, thanks to the community's demands for biodegradable packaging. Insulated packaging is become increasingly eco-friendly. For example, hemp, paper straw and sheep wool are easily recycled but can also be used for other projects.9.Offer an induction to students and laboratory newcomers to explain the laboratory's sustainable practices. Ideally the institution or department will offer this training on a regular basis as there is a fast turnover within academia.10.Adopt a climate-conscious approach to travel and collaborations – think about where and how often you travel, and what mode of transport you use; find collaborations and networks that are accessible via low-carbon travel. These often work well because you might be able to meet and discuss science in person more frequently or be in the same time zone to setup online discussions. Local collaborations also facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise between early career researchers because such interactions can be more spontaneous.The lockdowns during COVID showed us how important communication and social interactions are to humans. It also taught many of us about the power of online discussion and meetings. During the lockdowns, we all participated in virtual meetings that enabled us to remain connected, work together and facilitate knowledge exchange. Since then, virtual and hybrid meetings have become commonplace. However, this shift also highlighted the limitations of online meetings and seminars compared to their in-person counterparts. When attending events online, many distractions can make it challenging to maintain focus. Additionally, engaging with other scientists online does not replicate the valuable and often spontaneous discussions that occur during coffee breaks or while queuing for lunch at in-person events. These spontaneous interactions often spark innovative ideas and foster collaborations, underscoring the irreplaceable nature of face-to-face meetings. Attending meetings is essential for keeping up to date with the advancements of the field and in-person attendance at meetings is particularly important for early-career researchers to build their networks. Nonetheless, when organizing an in-person conference or event, there are many aspects that can be improved to reduce its CO2 carbon footprint.For example, meeting organizers can select food that has a lower environmental impact while respecting people's dietary requirements. To reduce plastic waste, ask the caterers to provide fruit, biscuits and cakes that are freshly made, rather than biscuits and snacks in individual wrapping. Food could also be locally sourced and there could be a significant proportion of vegetarian food. It is important to select minimally processed food, as many highly processed items have non-conventional ingredients to which people might be intolerant or allergic (for example, pea, soya or buckwheat are increasingly common allergens) as well as tending to have a higher carbon footprint.In terms of the scientific program, it is possible to invite a keynote speaker to speak remotely. One can also encourage participants to travel by low-carbon transport, ideally by train. There are also alternatives to traditional in-person meetings. Multi-hub meetings, for example, are a new and interesting meeting model, whereby a meeting is run remotely in different countries with local in-person hubs that foster real interactions (Lowell et al., 2022). To support such incentives, it is possible to raise funding to provide travel awards to participants; EMBO and The Company of Biologists have funds to support greener travel and they are also open to funding innovative ways to make conferences sustainable. Further support, including advice and funding opportunities, can also be found at The Company of Biologists' sustainability hub (Box 1).Improving sustainability within our research workflows will substantially reduce our environmental impact and lower our carbon footprint. Additionally, it has the potential to foster greater inclusivity and enhance the engagement of our research communities. By involving all researchers and funding bodies that provide support for sustainable practices and national standards, our sector can transform biomedical research into a discipline that is significantly and positively sustainable.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can result from a variety of clinical conditions, causing lung injury either directly through local inflammation or indirectly because of systemic inflammatory mediators [1] ARDS is associated with high morbidity and mortality [2]. Its pathophysiology is complex, involving the activation and dysregulation of multiple overlapping pathways related to injury, inflammation, and coagulation, both in the lung and systemically [3]. Sepsis is the most common cause of ARDS, with pulmonary sepsis (e.g., pneumonia) being the predominant etiology. Non-pulmonary sepsis and non-infectious causes, such as pancreatitis, aspiration of gastric contents, and severe traumatic injuries accompanied by shock and multiple transfusions, also contribute significantly to ARDS cases. Despite decades of experimental research into ARDS biology, these insights have rarely translated into effective therapies [4]. This lack of progress is often attributed to the substantial heterogeneity caused by the nonspecific clinical definition of ARDS [5].Identifying subphenotypes of ARDS-more homogeneous groups within the broader ARDS population-has emerged as a promising approach to unravel the syndrome's clinical and biological complexity, which many believe is a critical barrier to discovering effective treatments.Mechanical ventilation (MV) remains the cornerstone of supportive care for ARDS patients.However, improper MV settings can cause complications, most notably ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [6]. The regional heterogeneity of lung injury, combined with the uneven distribution of mechanical stress during ventilation, results in multiple mechanisms of VILI simultaneously affecting the lungs. While VILI primarily concerns the harmful effects of MV, similar injury pathways can also be triggered by vigorous spontaneous inspiratory efforts, which produce elevated transpulmonary pressures due to highly negative pleural pressures [7]. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, amplified in the injured lung by harmful MV practices, can enter the systemic circulation, exacerbating systemic inflammation and contributing to non-pulmonary organ failure.The recognition of ARDS heterogeneity, encompassing its biological, physiological, and radiological aspects, has led to progress in identifying distinct subphenotypes. A precisionmedicine approach that effectively classifies ARDS into more homogeneous subphenotypes could enhance our understanding of the syndrome's pathophysiological mechanisms and how these vary across patients, ultimately paving the way for more targeted and effective treatments [8]. This editorial highlights key studies from the research topic "Personalized Therapies in ARDS: Volume II," covering personalized MV techniques, ARDS treatments tailored to etiology, sub-phenotyping, and novel pharmacological strategies. ARDS, even within a single etiology such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a heterogeneous syndrome requiring a personalized MV approach [9]. Evidence suggests that lung-protective MV strategies are not adhered to in approximately 69% of cases [10]. This underscores the need for individualized, yet standardized, MV management strategies informed by a comprehensive understanding of the patient's physiology. In this line, Patel et al. conducted a multicenter international randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 95 ARDS patients to evaluate the feasibility of a physiological model-based decision support system (DSS) for tailoring MV strategies. Patients were randomized to receive either standard care (control) or DSS-guided care (intervention). Although there was no significant difference in average driving pressure between the groups, the intervention arm demonstrated improvements in the oxygenation index and ventilatory ratio during controlled MV mode compared to the control group. Additionally, the DSS led to a significant increase in ventilator adjustments, particularly for pressure settings and respiratory frequency.Importantly, the physiological condition of patients improved when approximately 60% of DSS recommendations were followed, reinforcing the value of personalized yet repeatable MV strategies. These findings highlight the potential of DSS tools to refine MV management, ultimately improving outcomes in ARDS patients through a more tailored approach.The equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic presented extreme challenges for many countries. To address the scarcity of devices, alternative strategies were proposed [11,12]. Despite the global resource limitations, the emphasis on personalized MV strategies remained strong, even in scenarios involving shared ventilation between patients. Achanta et al. explored a ventilator-sharing system through benchtop testing that allowed simultaneous ventilation of two patients using a single mechanical ventilator, coupled with a monitoring system to remotely track pulmonary mechanics. The study extended to a swine translational model of lung injury induced by saline lavage to validate the system's functionality in both bench and in vivo settings. The benchtop testing demonstrated precise delivery of MV parameters. In the animal model, specific target inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes were set, and the system successfully adjusted for differences between the two pigs. For instance, if one animal reached its target volume or pressure before the other, it experienced a prolonged end-inspiratory pause and stopped receiving flow until both targets were met. While the system introduced a relatively individualized approach to MV settings, addressing some limitations of previous designs, it did not allow for self-tests on the shared ventilator or individualized management of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [13] These limitations restrict its potential for safe application in human clinical settings.Over the past few decades, the primary objective of PEEP usage has evolved from solely improving oxygenation to prioritizing lung protection. An "optimal" PEEP simultaneously enhances alveolar recruitment and gas exchange while preventing overdistension and minimizing hemodynamic compromise. Once PEEP is set, it is important to regularly reassess its impact on cardiopulmonary function [14,15]. Circulatory failure can result from both too low and too high PEEP levels because they can raise pulmonary vascular resistance, hinder pulmonary circulation, and impede right ventricular performance [16]. Xingzheng et al. conducted a prospective paired-design study involving 52 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS to evaluate the effects of different PEEP levels on cardiovascular function and the incidence of acute cor pulmonale (ACP). The study tested PEEP settings of 5 cmH₂O, 10 cmH₂O, and 15 cmH₂O, while maintaining end-inspiratory plateau pressure ≤30 cmH₂O. The incidence of ACP was 25%, with the highest occurrence observed at a PEEP of 15 cmH₂O.As PEEP levels increased from 5 to 10 and 15 cmH₂O, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) ratio improved. However, higher PEEP values were associated with a modest rise in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂). At a PEEP of 15 cmH₂O, significant adverse cardiovascular effects were noted, including reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, increased right ventricular end-diastolic area, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, a 14% reduction in cardiac index, and an 18.1% drop in stroke volume index compared to PEEP settings of 5 or 10 cmH₂O. Additionally, higher PEEP levels led to a marked decline in the end-diastolic volume index and extravascular lung water index. This study highlights the variability in ACP incidence depending on the PEEP setting in ARDS patients. PEEP levels must be carefully individualized based on the patient's cardiovascular function to optimize outcomes. Atakul et al. evaluated a closed-loop oxygen control system in 33 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) undergoing invasive MV for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patients were randomized to begin with either manual adjustment or a two-hour period of closed-loop oxygen titration. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels were maintained within a predetermined target range using either automated or manual FiO2 adjustments. The closedloop oxygen control demonstrated significant advantages: patients managed with the automated system spent a significantly higher percentage of time within the target SpO2 range compared to manual adjustment (95.7% vs. 65.6%). Additionally, the automated system achieved a higher median SpO2/FiO2 ratio (p=0.001), required a lower median FiO2 (32.1% vs. 40.6%, p=0.001), and significantly reduced the number of manual adjustments (p<0.001).Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is employed in patients with severe ARDS to support gas exchange, and deliver safe MV (Pplat), when other strategies fail to yield sufficient benefits [4]. Observational studies and meta-analysis found that ARDS patients in VV-ECMO significantly improved outcomes and lowered 60-day mortality more than those on traditional MV [17][18][19]. Current guidelines recommend using VV-ECMO for patients with severe ARDS, as defined by the EOLIA trial eligibility criteria, in centers meeting defined organizational standards. A bibliometric analysis by Lu et al. Sepsis-induced ARDS was more commonly linked to pulmonary infections caused by A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, which were associated with higher mortality rates, worse APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II scores, and poorer oxygenation indices compared to ARDS from non-pulmonary infections. Both the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and ROX index were negatively correlated with prognosis.The antioxidant effects of vitamin C therapy may mitigate tissue injury induced by oxidative stress in sepsis. However, in adults with sepsis receiving vasopressor therapy in the ICU, those who received intravenous vitamin C had a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days than those who received placebo [20]. Alissa et al., in their review, highlighted the potential benefits of co-administering vitamin C in patients with sepsis and septic shock caused by pneumonia leading to ARDS.In conclusion, the presentation of ARDS varies significantly across three key dimensions: (1) etiological, (2) physiological, and (3) biological. This variability emphasizes that a "typical" ARDS does not exist. The lack of a uniform presentation calls for a personalized medicine approach. Advanced subphenotyping and integrative analyses of these variations may uncover additional treatable traits, paving the way for more targeted therapies.

Key conditions of evaluation included different plant species, growth media, exposure routes, environments, exposure durations, and types of nanomaterials, among others. Often, these tests are compared with bulk materials, ionic species, or even conventional/commercial formulations, which are at the opposite ends of the possible fate of pristine nanomaterials, especially of nutrient elements. As recently discussed by Vaidya et al., many of the initial studies in this space investigated the phytotoxicity of nanomaterials. (1) However, data began to accumulate demonstrating that not only were there instances where nanomaterials were not toxic but also that under many conditions, there were exposure scenarios where significant benefit to the plant was evident. As such, the focus of nanotechnology and plants began to shift toward applications in sustainable agriculture, initially to augment conventional agrochemicals such as fertilizers. Hence, investigations on the development and use of nanoenabled agrochemicals (nanofertilizers, nanopesticides, nanostimulants, and nanopolymer-based agrochemicals in general) increased dramatically, involving the use of nanomaterials in pristine forms, or as materials to encapsulate, coat, embed, or incorporate into fertilizer-nutrients, along with testing these materials at environmentally relevant application rates for crop production. These later studies have been conducted across a large number of countries and have demonstrated the promise of nanotechnology in sustainable agriculture. (2−7) Importantly, a major driver of this field of research is the general recognition that maintaining anything close to global food security in the coming decades for a rapidly increasing population in a changing climate is likely impossible with conventional agriculture and that a transformation of our food production, distribution, and storage systems is not only necessary but must begin immediately.With this background, studies on nanoscale sulfur under both greenhouse and field conditions have been conducted, elaborating novel mechanisms of sulfur effects leading to enhanced plant growth and yield. (8−10) In response to one of these studies, (9) Husted et al. 2024 have published a comment entitled "Nanotechnology papers with an agricultural focus are too frequently published with a superficial or poor understanding of basic plant and soil science - a critical comment to recent papers in ACS Nano." We appreciate our colleagues' enthusiasm for this field of research and strongly agree with the desire to advance the most impactful science, with the overall goal of bringing viable technologies to the field that can address this most wicked of problems, combatting global food insecurity in a changing climate. However, the authors raise several points that merit a response.The central thesis of Husted et al., as noted in their title, is that there are fundamental flaws in experimental design and results interpretation in the literature and specifically, in papers published in ACS Nano. A quick search reveals that as of October 2024, ACS Nano has published approximately 67 research papers in this space, with 60 of them being in the last 5 years. However, Husted et al. provide no evidence of what they describe as studies "weak in experimental design, rich in misunderstandings of basic plant and soil science" in any other paper in ACS Nano, other than their identified target of Wang et al. 2024, (9) nor do they provide such examples in what they refer to as any other "reputed and society-owned journal." Interestingly, the authors take the odd approach of laying blame on the journal editors (although one is not sure which journals are more prominent than ACS Nano), indicating that reviewers with "plant and soil competencies" are excluded from the review process.Husted et al. also seem particularly concerned about what they describe as the "sensational claim" of "boosted biomass productivity of 81%" reported in the greenhouse study of Wang et al., although the abstract from that paper clearly states that this increase was in the root biomass and that the shoot biomass was increased by 35–50% with the different forms of nanoscale sulfur relative to the nutrient in conventional forms. Although Wang et al. was a greenhouse experiment in a commercial potting mix with a focus on understanding mechanisms of nanoscale sulfur uptake, translocation and impact; we would like to point out a number of published field scale studies where similar amendments, including nanoscale sulfur in soil, increased the actual harvested yield of specific crops by 21–240%, including coated and uncoated nanoscale sulfur (the materials used in Wang et al). (3,7,8,11)Husted et al. also expressed concern over the design of the greenhouse experiment in Wang et al. 2024, specifically suggesting that the concentrations of commercial bulk sized S and ionic S (Na2SO4) used (100 and 200 ppm) were inappropriate and may cause potential phytotoxicity from excess S or Na+. However, as noted in our paper, phenotypic and biomass data show no evidence that the plants were stressed by these treatments. Moreover, a number of published studies (Table 1) have used much higher concentrations of S (up to 10,000 ppm) or Na+ (up to ∼1,400 ppm) in soil-grown plant experiments, and the same can be found for ionic S and Na+, showing either beneficial effects on plant growth or no phytotoxicity. While the dose of an element does make the poison, the environment can clearly modulate or even negate dose-inspired toxicity. For example, nutrients at high doses can be toxic in acidic soil but not in alkaline soil at the same dose (see for example, Watson et al., 2015 (12)). Clearly, there are several soil chemistry factors that modulate how plants respond to elements or nutrients at different doses. In addition, a subsequent study from our group on the effect of soil-applied S treatments at the same concentration had minimal effects on the soil bacterial and eukaryotic communities. (13) In addition, the background concentrations of S and Na in natural field soil have been reported to be as high as 0.1 wt % (1,000 ppm) for S (14) and 0.70 wt % (7000 ppm) as a median level for Na. (15) Another important line of evidence supporting the lack of toxicity of bulk S or Na2SO4 treatments in our study is the nutrient element profiles in the leaves, stems, and roots. Specifically, the levels of Na, which are related to plant stress, were not significantly changed by bulk S or ionic S treatments compared to the untreated control; a similar lack of change was noted for other nutrient elements, including K, P, Mn, Cu, B, Ca, and Si. Although subtle changes were found with Mg, Fe, or Zn contents in certain organs, over 90% of the elemental measurement results were unaffected by either bulk sulfur or ionic sulfur treatments, clearly demonstrating no subtle negative effect with treatment.Table 1.

(2016)PakchoiNa2S (1% w/w, or 10,000 ppm)45 daysMahar et al. (2016)Husted et al. also seem particularly concerned that we did not use field soil but instead used a commercially available potting mix. In fact, much specialty crop agriculture actually uses commercial potting mixes for crop growth, both to establish seedlings in the greenhouse prior to field transplanting and for full life cycle cultivation in greenhouses. Moreover, the use of model media ranging from hydroponics to sand to potting media is a common strategy used for decades in the hundreds (thousands?) of published studies in both nanotoxicology and nanoenabled agriculture. Although the analysis of this commercial potting mix was not provided in the paper, it is readily available for the product on the company Web site. (17) Importantly, the potting mix only has 30–100 ppm (mg/L) sulfur/sulfate, a level of S that is in fact considerably lower than most field soils, many of which are above 1000 ppm (mg/kg). (14) And perhaps last and most importantly, we again highlight the field studies noted above where levels of increased growth and yield similar to that of the current greenhouse study with commercial potting mix were published, including with the same materials used in our current study.Husted et al. noted that the elemental analysis of plant tissues for nutrients other than S was not provided. This was indeed an oversight on our part; the work is described in the methods in the paper. There were minimal changes in the content of other nutrients as a function of treatment, and our intent was to include this in the SI; we intend to publish a correction to ensure that those interested have access to this data. The authors also expressed concern over the effects of S treatments on photosynthesis, indicating that the chlorophyll content can vary without a concomitant change in photosynthetic rates. On that basis, they suggested that information on leaf conductance to show stress-induced reductions should have been provided in lieu of chlorophyll content. However, previous studies have shown that leaf conductance is even more susceptible to environmental influence, and thus, may not be the best indicator of stress response. (18−21) Specifically, the leaf conductance, or stomatal conductance, which is the rate at which water vapor exits and carbon dioxide enters the leaf through the stomata, is affected by several factors other than disease-induced stress, including environmental factors (light intensity, temperature, wind speed, CO2 concentration, etc.), water availability, plant hormones, and nutrient availability. (18−21) Nevertheless, our objective was to understand the growth and development of the plants under the studied conditions, not as a stress response. Compared with leaf conductance, chlorophyll content is more widely used as an indicator to assess plant growth and development since it plays a crucial and direct role in photosynthesis. Although there are different types of chlorophyll in plants, all of these pigments work together to capture light energy and transfer it to the photosynthetic reaction centers. Notably, the measurement in this regard was not a "simple pigment absorbance measurement" as suggested by Husted et al. A MultispeQ unit was used, which is a useful (and commonly used) hand-held device to nondestructively provide information on various photosynthetic parameters. This instrument combines the functionality of a hand-held fluorometer, a chlorophyll meter, and a benchtop spectrometer to measure linear electron flow (LEF), nonphotochemical quenching (NPQt), Quantum yield of Photosystem II (Phi2), ratio of incoming light that is lost via nonregulated processes (PhiNO), ratio of incoming light (excited electrons) that goes toward nonphotochemical quenching (PhiNPQ), photosystem I active centers, photosystem I open centers, photosystem I over reduced centers, photosystem I oxidized centers, and relative chlorophyll. Notably, all of these parameters were measured at each sampling point; because of the space limitation of the article, only the values that were significantly impacted by treatment were highlighted.Husted et al. also question the paper's two-photon microscopy data; however, the basis of this particular concern is elusive. As noted in the paper, we optimized and validated the two-photon microscopy measurement and laser wavelength using pure S materials. We took an orthogonal approach to evaluate plant response to S treatment, including in planta distribution of the element as a function of particle type. Specifically, two-photon microscopy enabled us to visualize the 3D distribution of the NPs in the plants. Previous applications of two-photon microscopy on NPs detection in plant tissues have been reported and our results were discussed in the context of some of those previous studies. (22) In Wang et al. 2024, (9) videos of NP distribution in the leaves and roots were provided. The authors are correct that autofluorescence is always a concern with plant tissues, but by optimizing our approach as noted above, the fluorescence signals of the NPs were clearly significantly different and observable, as shown in the study. This is the advantage of two-photon microscopy over the confocal microscopy, where an additional staining step is required, which may cause dye drop or release.Husted et al. also had some concerns about our time-dependent gene expression and metabolomics approach. The primary concern here seems to trace back to the concentration of S materials used; they believe that the control plants were unduly stressed, and as such, the mechanistic insights provided by the gene expression and metabolomic data were compromised. As noted above, we clearly demonstrated that the control plants were not stressed in this greenhouse study and noted that these controls produced quite ample yield in the parallel field study. (8) At this point, Husted et al. also make the statement that we actually induced S starvation in the plants. However, the dissolution data presented in the SI clearly indicate no major differences in sulfate release between the bulk and nanoscale S. Also, the elemental analysis data based on ICP-OES clearly shows no evidence of starvation, based on the comparison of relative S levels in the plants between the control and nano S treatments. Perhaps most befuddling is reconciling the concerns of Husted et al. that we somehow simultaneously induced both starvation and toxicity in the same plants with our conventional S treatments. Husted et al. also suggest that any transcriptomic data should be validated by the use of mutants and transgenics. Although this may be a good idea in certain instances, thousands of published studies utilizing gene expression data in the absence of mutants and transgenics demonstrate that this is far from a necessity.It is also rather surprising that Husted et al. described our studies on S as being observational and neither driven by hypothesis nor demonstrating mechanisms, indicating that we focus only on "sensational" observations. The validated increases in yield noted in the published field studies described above demonstrate the lack of sensationalism in our work. The work clearly hypothesized that nanoscale sulfur offers unique advantages, and this study was designed to evaluate that hypothesis; why this is unclear to Husted et al. is perplexing. And perhaps most confusing is their contention that the paper fails to demonstrate mechanisms of action. An orthogonal analytical approach with multiple types of nanoscale and conventional sulfur was used with methods including time-dependent gene expression, metabolomic, and element analyses; two-photon microscopy; and a range of agronomic and photosynthetic end points. The findings from these end points were then evaluated against sulfur type, dissolution profile, and concentration. How one could describe this experimental design as lacking in mechanistic insight seems quite odd, particularly when noting the second half of the title of the paper "··· An Orthogonal Mechanistic Investigation." Notably, several reviewers and the handling editor at ACS Nano were comfortable with this title.In closing, Husted et al. should be commended on highlighting the importance of this field of research; combatting rising global food insecurity in a changing climate is indeed an existential crisis and will be among the most significant challenges faced in the coming decades. But even more importantly, the scientific community does indeed have the expertise and tools to solve this problem; that is certain. There will be no silver bullet or single solution but instead a broad range of strategies and technologies spanning disciplines as diverse as nanotechnology, molecular biology, plant genetics, agronomy, plant biology, engineering, toxicology, and soil science that will drive the needed transformation in agriculture. All we need to do is work together and get this done.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorJason C.

(Royal Society of Chemistry) Nanoparticles (NP) have great potential in agriculture. For example, micronutrients have poor mobility in plants and poor availability in neutral soils, yet they play pivotal roles in root health. We investigated whether foliar sprays of micronutrient NP could affect plant health in disease infested soils. In the greenhouse, NP of AlO, CuO, FeO, MnO, NiO, and ZnO were sprayed on tomatoes and grown in soilless medium infested with the Fusarium wilt fungus. NP of CuO, MnO, or ZnO reduced disease ests. [area-under-the-disease-progress-curve (AUDPC)] by 31%, 28%, or 28%, resp., when compared to untreated controls. When NP of CuO, MnO, or ZnO, their bulked equiv., or their sulfate salts were compared to untreated eggplants and held in the greenhouse in soilless medium infested with the Verticillium wilt fungus, NP of CuO increased fresh wts. by 64%, reduced AUDPC values by 69%, and had 32% more Cu in the roots. These same amendments were sprayed onto the foliage of tomato and eggplant transplants and set in field plots in soil heavily infested with the Verticillium wilt fungus. Compared to untreated controls, yields of tomato were 33% or 31% greater with NP of CuO or the bulked MnO, resp. NP of CuO or ZnSO4 increased eggplant yields by 34% or 41% when compared to controls, resp. In vitro studies found NP of CuO were not inhibitory to the Fusarium wilt fungus, suggesting host defense was being manipulated. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC28Xht12ks7zL&md5=a9cd03276bd9998f939a2998b84e61f54Wang, C.; Liu, X.; Li, J.; Yue, L.; Yang, H.; Zou, H.; Wang, Z.; Xing, B.

As nearly half of the world's population headed to the polls this year, politics grabbed many of the headlines. But scientists and the natural world also managed to attract the public's attention. Here, Knowable Magazine takes a look at some of the most notable research-related events and discoveries of 2024, as well as a few studies and policy moves that we are eager to watch play out in the coming year.Sky showCelestial events encouraged many people to look skyward this year, with the Sun taking center stage.In April, millions of people stopped to watch the "Great North American Eclipse." Total solar eclipses happen every year or two, but this one provided the longest period of totality visible from land in over a decade, casting its shadow on a path smack over North America. The show was mostly of interest as a public spectacle, but citizen science projects also helped to collect data that should, for example, help to refine models of solar activity.Sky gazers were also stunned by auroras this year, thanks to a natural peak in solar activity caused by the 11-year cycle of the flipping of the Sun's magnetic poles. While this solar maximum doesn't look particularly strong in terms of the number of sunspots, "there were many more big flares than we would expect compared to the last cycle," says solar physicist Lyndsay Fletcher of the University of Glasgow. "It's quite exciting." Big flares in May created the biggest solar storm to reach the Earth in just over two decades, and more big flares brought bright lights to the skies in October.The last dramatic year for auroras was two cycles ago, in 2003. Back then, we didn't have pervasive cell phone cameras that could easily capture aurora colors, or social media sites like Facebook to spread the news. The show will continue: Forecasts show the solar maximum lasting into early 2025.Particles spewed from the Sun in May and October 2024 brought painterly skies to many latitudes, including Newport Pagnell in the United Kingdom, where this photo was taken. Red aurora are less common than green and occur when solar particles react with the atmosphere at higher altitudes, usually a mark of powerful solar activity.CREDIT: BRIAN TOMLINSON / FLICKRAlongside these solar fireworks, heliophysicists have some fresh data to look forward to: This Christmas Eve, NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission will get closer to the Sun than ever before, zooming by at 3.8 million miles from the surface. Such studies help astronomers to better understand the solar activity that leads to both auroras and space weather that can foul up electrical equipment.Total map of a brainIn October, scientists published the first complete map of a complex (though tiny) brain: that of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, one of the most-studied animals in biological research. The new "connectome" charts the wiring between 140,000 neurons, giving new insights into the roles of different brain regions.Scientists completed a major feat in 2024 — mapping all the neurons in a fruit fly brain.CREDIT: FLYWIRE PRINCETONThe human brain presents a far bigger challenge, with more than 80 billion neurons. But scientists have made a start. In May, researchers at Google revealed a 3D image of a tiny piece of human brain the size of half a grain of rice, containing about 16,000 neurons. That adds to an atlas of brain cell types created by the European Union's Human Brain Project last year.Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are helping to tackle these data-heavy tasks. Along with seeking to better understand fundamentals of how the brain works, such projects aim to solve mysteries of human mental illnesses or chart better paths to recovery after brain injury — and, along the way, might also help to improve AI.Hot EarthIt will come as no surprise that 2024 once again broke heat records, with the global average temperature topping 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average for the first time. High summer temperatures brought the planet's fourth and most widespread global coral bleaching event, affecting around 75 percent of global corals.In 2024, the global average temperature hit 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average for the first time.A warmer planet comes with extreme weather: Unusual heat in the Gulf of Mexico fed supercharged hurricanes, and Valencia, Spain, received more than a year's worth of rain in eight hours in October, causing deadly flooding. "The urgency is very tangible," says Andrew Satchwell, an energy economist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who works on climate policy.Global carbon dioxide emissions looked like they were starting to level off in 2023, but 2024 saw emissions bump upward again. The world is not on track to hit Paris Agreement targets that aim to limit warming. Instead, current policies and actions look set to see a world that's perhaps 2.7 degrees C warmer by 2100. Still, a few policy moves are starting to see traction. In the United States, for example, substantial pots of cash from the Inflation Reduction Act to decarbonize the country's energy started to flow in 2024. "I think we have seen a turn," says Satchwell. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Physical World Are we ready? Understanding just how big solar flares can get Physical World How the moon landings changed our view of the solar system Food & Environment How to overcome political polarization on climate change Efforts to track emissions of methane — an even more powerful though shorter-lived greenhouse gas — have revealed some nasty surprises. The largest inventory of methane emissions from US oil and gas production, for example, found them to be around three times the government estimate. A 2024 report highlighted a worrying bump up in large methane leaks detected, including a record-breaking blowout in Kazakhstan that lasted more than 6 months.Dealing with dementiaThis year, several researcher groups took big steps toward a simple and cheap blood test for Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for around two-thirds of the world's 55 million cases of dementia; the UK's Blood Biomarker Challenge hopes to add a routine blood test for dementia to the British public health care system within five years.More extensive diagnosis is key to tackling Alzheimer's, says Joshua Grill, director of the Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders at the University of California, Irvine. "We have to catch people early."The disease has no cure, but early-stage patients may benefit from new drugs that aim to slow its progression: Monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid protein, which builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, have made waves after a 20-year gap with no new drugs for the disease. "These positive trials were a big deal and very welcome," says Grill. Donanemab was approved in the United States this year, following lecanemab's approval in 2023.People with early-stage Alzheimer's may benefit from new drugs that aim to slow its progression.Such drugs might even prove effective at preventing the disease in high-risk people who haven't yet shown memory symptoms; trials are underway and the results should be out in four years, says Grill. Meanwhile, a 2024 Lancet report by a panel of dementia experts listed more than a dozen simple actions that research has shown can help to prevent or delay dementia, from using hearing aids to keeping cholesterol in check and exercising.Work on conditions that plague our later years is welcome as the global population ages dramatically. Between 2015 and 2050, the percentage of people over 60 years old is expected to nearly double, to 22 percent.Plastic pollution panicPlastics hit the spotlight this year as delegates to the United Nations tried to thrash out an international treaty to end plastic pollution. Although they failed to come to an agreement by December as originally planned, their work will continue next year."Personally, I remain hopeful; there are answers to this problem."— RICHARD THOMPSONThere are now an estimated eight gigatons of accumulated plastic on Earth — twice as much as the weight of all animal life. Plastic has leached into every corner of our lives, including our oceans, air, food, blood and mothers' milk. To support the treaty process, researchers modeled various plastic control policies and cataloged more than 16,000 plastic chemicals. More than 4,200 of these were found to be of concern because they were "persistent, bioaccumulative, mobile and/or toxic.""I would far rather we take the time needed to agree upon a strong treaty rather than settle for something of little substance," says Richard Thompson, a marine biologist at the University of Plymouth in England who studies plastics and is coleader of the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. "Personally, I remain hopeful; there are answers to this problem." The key, he says, is to dramatically reduce overall production, and make the remaining essential plastics "better by design" — with more recycled content, for example, and fewer toxic additives.Researchers also continue to seek out better ways to recycle or dispose of plastics (including finding fungi or bacteria to do the job), or to create more biodegradable versions.AI gets superchargedArtificial intelligence programs improved dramatically this year. The large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT have now surpassed people in many areas; some can achieve medal-worthy performance in the Math Olympiad and beat science PhDs in "Google-proof" tests of their own fields. The wave of developments caught the eye of the Nobel committee, with 2024 prizes in both physics and chemistry going to AI-related discoveries.As the technology advances, the electricity and water demand for the computing that powers AI has ballooned worryingly. "We're starting to see industrial-scale challenges for power supply," says data scientist Jakub Kraus from the Center for AI Policy in Washington, DC, who notes that big tech companies are now turning to nuclear power to fill their voracious energy needs.Despite their cleverness, chatbots continue to make serious mistakes, hallucinate false facts and perpetuate bias. Misuse can cause serious problems. AI-generated deepfakes made waves in this year's elections, for example when Joe Biden's voice was cloned to send out fake telemarketing calls urging Democrats not to vote in the primaries.The European Union's AI Act, which went into force in August, will begin to regulate AI providers and ensure good practices, such as transparency about how the systems work. "This is a good step forward," says Kraus. "Overall, there has not been a major AI policy package in the US. That might change."Votes cast for change2024 was a year of both communal action and global divides. Around the world, a record-setting number of voters headed to the polls: More than 75 nations, holding roughly half of the world's population, held national elections. The prevailing trend was for change: An ABC News analysis showed that in over 80 percent of democracies, the incumbent party lost seats or voter share.In elections in over 80 percent of democracies, the incumbent party lost seats or voter share in 2024.In this banner "super year" for elections, the entire concept of democracy is facing challenges. Voter turnout is going down, riots have become more common, election results are often disputed in courts and there are deep and troubling social divides, including in the United States."American democracy is in crisis," writes legal scholar Bertrall Ross of the University of Virginia in the 2024 Annual Review of Law and Social Science. "Both sides perceive every election as an existential threat to their ways of life."A river runs through itThe Paris Summer Olympics threw a spotlight on water pollution when athletes complained bitterly about the poor condition of the Seine, which was meant to be clean for the games. Paris is not alone. Rivers the world over increasingly face troubles from pollution, decreased water supply and more. An August series of reports from the UN Environment Program found worrying changes to the distribution, quantity and quality of river water globally: River flow, for example, has decreased in 402 basins worldwide.That may be a small fraction of the total 12,572 basins, but it's a fivefold increase over the number of dwindling rivers documented 15 years ago. And pollution makes things worse. A 2024 research paper concluded that out of 10,000 global river basins, around 1,000 face problems because of water scarcity, and that number more than doubles, to 2,500, when taking into account nitrogen pollution, mainly from agricultural runoff.Disease dangers spreadingThe mosquito-spread dengue virus raised alarms this year as cases hit record numbers. The Americas have been hardest hit, with more than 12 million cases — double the number from 2023 and three to four times the average over the past five years.The meteoric rise in dengue cases has infectious disease specialists scratching their heads.In October, the World Health Organization launched a plan to tackle the disease globally. Dengue is rarely fatal, says Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. But the meteoric rise in cases has infectious disease specialists scratching their heads. "I'm worried that we don't understand what's going on," Weaver says. Climate change might be part of the answer. Other mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile virus are on the rise in more temperate climes like Europe as the world warms.Meanwhile, mpox is also a pressing concern. The disease — previously known as monkey pox — was considered a disease largely spread to humans from other animals and endemic to central and west Africa. Then in 2022, cases spread by close person-to-person contact began popping up globally. In August 2024, an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was declared a public health emergency of international concern as a more virulent and deadly form of the virus — called clade 1 — started to spread, with the first known case appearing in the US in November. "This is pretty concerning," says Weaver.Five years after the outbreak of Covid-19, better plans for coping with pandemics remain elusive: Delegates to the World Health Organization disappointingly failed to come to an agreement for a treaty on pandemic responses this year. "I'm not very optimistic that international cooperation is going to improve a lot," says Weaver.Moon mattersSeveral craft are sent to the Moon every year, but 2024 brought a few special successes: Texas-based Intuitive Machines became the first company to put a lander on the Moon, and Japan became the fifth nation to do so. Excitingly, China's Chang'e-6 mission brought back the first rocks ever collected from the "far side" of the Moon, with signs of surprisingly young volcanism."After the Apollo missions, it was thought that the Moon was homogenous, and there was a feeling we'd 'been there done that.' We now know that's not true; it's much more rich and varied," says planetary geologist John Spray of the University of New Brunswick in Canada. "There's renewed excitement about what we can learn from the Moon." NASA is planning to send people back to explore, starting with an orbital mission in 2025.Stay in the KnowSign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter todayAliens ahoyThere's no proof of alien life as yet, but researchers keep looking. In July, NASA's Perseverance rover took photos of an intriguing rock on Mars with leopard-pattern spots that could be evidence of ancient microbes. "These spots are a big surprise," said David Flannery, an astrobiologist on the Perseverance science team, in a statement from NASA. "On Earth, these types of features in rocks are often associated with the fossilized record of microbes living in the subsurface."In May, astronomers spotted a planet, Gliese 12 b, that's only slightly larger and warmer than Earth and could be habitable — one of a handful of Earth-like worlds among the more than 5,000 exoplanets spotted over the past 30 years, and among the closest such finds to date at just 40 light-years away.Aliens may be top of mind for those captivated earlier this year by Netflix's mind-bending 2024 sci-fi hit "3 Body Problem," about an alien civilization threatened by chaotic climate caused by unpredictable orbits of its three suns. The story is kicked off by a real-life event: a mysterious radio signal picked up in 1977 that is often conjectured to be a sign of intelligent communication. Sadly, this August the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo published a report proposing a natural origin for the so-called WOW! signal: the sudden brightening of a cold hydrogen cloud.The show's 3 Body Problem, by the way, is also a real-life puzzle in physics: how to predict the interaction of three large objects like stars in which none dominates the orbits of the others. Mathematicians made progress this year in finding a less computationally intensive way of calculating the outcomes of these chaotic systems.

Biomacromolecules is proud to support efforts toward tackling diseases such as cancers. In this year's iteration of the World Cancer Day Collection (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/world-cancer-day-2024), the journal nominated breast cancer-tackling research on hydrogels based on elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) hydrogels as suitable biomaterials to develop more predictive breast cancer models, copolymer nanoparticles from original thermoresponsive block copolymers containing lipid-based segments which demonstrate increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis or necrosis induction in breast cancer cells, as well as immunological studies on biopolymer nonsmall-molecule inhibitor therapeutics. (5−7) World Microbiome Day 2024The scope of Biomacromolecules covers both naturally occurring biopolymers as well as synthetic polymers introduced to a biological environment. Celebrating World Microbiome Day 2024 (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/world-microbiome-day-2024), Biomacromolecules nominated articles showcasing: phage protection during cryopreservation, highlighting that a particular benefit of a polymeric cryopreservation formulation is that the polymers do not function as carbon sources for the phage hosts (bacteria) and hence do not interfere with post-thaw measurements; (8) a comprehensive analysis of the biodegradation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chemically modified PHB with different chemical and crystal structures in a soil environment; (9) and wound healing enhanced by a cross-linked macromolecular network based on gelatin loaded with metabolites from Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG that can accelerate wound healing by mitigating infections induced by pathogenic bacteria, accompanied by a reduction in the expression of key proinflammatory cytokines. (10) Peptide Conjugation and DeliveryPeptide conjugation methodology has become crucial in the fields of drug delivery, vaccine development, and biotechnology; from coacervates to nanoparticles, polymer research is driving forward methodology of drug delivery in leaps and bounds.Bioconjugate Chemistry and Biomacromolecules showcased the state of the art in peptide conjugation methodology in a joint Collection (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/peptide-delivery). We continue to welcome research at the interface between peptide conjugation and polymer science, focused on improving biocompatibility, stability, and functionality of bioconjugates toward improving therapeutic applications. (11) Some additional featured articles included demonstrations of complex coacervate core micelles as a promising strategy for efficient enzyme delivery systems after increasing the net charge of enzymes through genetic engineering, and cyclic peptide self-assembled nanotubes demonstrated to improve in vitro cell uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetic/biodistribution behavior compared to equivalent covalent molecular bottle-brush polymers. (12,13) 2024 Nobel Prizes in Medicine, Chemistry, and PhysicsFrom microRNAs to artificial intelligence in protein design and prediction, this was an exciting year for those who love biological chemistry. ACS Publications posted two Collections to celebrate both the 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/nobel-prize-medicine-2024), and the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, focused Protein Design and Prediction (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/nobel-prize-medicine-2024).Biomacromolecules is delighted to be able to support researchers from across nearly all these prize-winning fields and offered publications to the above Collections on bone regeneration through microRNA-based regulation, as well as computational hydrogel design, and a Perspective on the applications of machine learning to biopolymer data.

(American Chemical Society) This work presents a comprehensive anal. of the biodegrdn. of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chem. modified PHB with different chem. and crystal structures in a soil environment. A polymer modification reaction was performed during prepn. of the chem. modified PHB films, utilizing 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-hexane as a free-radical initiator and maleic anhydride. Films of neat PHB and chem. modified PHB were prepd. by extrusion and thermocompression. The biol. agent employed was natural mixed microflora in the form of garden soil. The course and extent of biodegrdn. of the films was investigated by applying various techniques, as follows: a respirometry test to det. the prodn. of carbon dioxide through microbial degrdn.; SEM (SEM); optical microscopy; fluorescence microscopy; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Next-generation sequencing was carried out to study the microbial community involved in biodegrdn. of the films. Findings from the respirometry test indicated that biodegrdn. of the extruded and chem. modified PHB followed a multistage (2-3) course, which varied according to the spatial distribution of amorphous and cryst. regions and their spherulitic morphol. SEM and polarized optical microscopy (POM) confirmed that the rate of biodegrdn. depended on the availability of the amorphous phase in the interspherulitic region and the width of the interlamellar region in the first stage, while dependence on the size of spherulites and thickness of spherulitic lamellae was evident in the second stage. X-ray diffraction revealed that orthorhombic α-form crystals with helical chain conformation degraded concurrently with β-form crystals with planar zigzag conformation. The nucleation of PHB crystals after 90 days of biodegrdn. was identified by DSC and POM, a phenomenon which impeded biodegrdn. Fluorescence microscopy evidenced that the crystal structure of PHB affected the physiol. behavior of soil microorganisms in contact with the surfaces of the films. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXitVynurjJ&md5=97522dedf8a0320f182edd92109bcfe510Han, Y.; Yin, Z.; Wang, Y.; Jiang, Y.; Chen, J.; Miao, Z.; He, F.; Cheng, R.; Tan, L.; Li, K.

Mieke; Borst, Jan WillemBiomacromolecules (2022), 23 (3), 1195-1204CODEN: BOMAF6; ISSN:1525-7797. (American Chemical Society) Encapsulation of proteins can have advantages for their protection, stability, and delivery purposes. One of the options to encapsulate proteins is to incorporate them in complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms). This can easily be achieved by mixing aq. solns. of the protein and an oppositely charged neutral-hydrophilic diblock copolymer. However, protein-contg. C3Ms often suffer from salt-inducible disintegration due to the low charge d. of proteins. The aim of this study is to improve the salt stability of protein-contg. C3Ms by increasing the net charge of the protein by tagging it with a charged polypeptide. As a model protein, we used CotA laccase and generated variants with 10, 20, 30, and 40 glutamic acids attached at the C-terminus of CotA using genetic engineering. Micelles were obtained by mixing the five CotA variants with poly(N-methyl-2-vinyl-pyridinium)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PM2VP128-b-PEO477) at pH 10.8. Hydrodynamic radii of the micelles of approx. 31, 27, and 23 nm for native CotA, CotA-E20, and CotA-E40, resp., were detd. using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The encapsulation efficiency was not affected using enzymes with a polyglutamic acid tail but resulted in more micelles with a smaller no. of enzyme mols. per micelle. Furthermore, it was shown that the addn. of a polyglutamic acid tail to CotA indeed resulted in improved salt stability of enzyme-contg. C3Ms. Interestingly, the polyglutamic acid CotA variants showed an enhanced enzyme activity. This study demonstrates that increasing the net charge of enzymes through genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve the practical applicability of C3Ms as enzyme delivery systems. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38Xht1yrsLw%253D&md5=9d2c5ccf68e96917916a97e79653147413Kerr, A.; Sagita, E.; Mansfield, E.

(American Chemical Society) A review. This Perspective outlines recent progress and future directions for using machine learning (ML), a data-driven method, to address crit. questions in the design, synthesis, processing, and characterization of biomacromols. The achievement of these tasks requires the navigation of vast and complex chem. and biol. spaces, difficult to accomplish with reasonable speed.

Likewise, modern approaches in chem. and biomol. simulation, supported by high performance computing, have culminated in producing data sets of escalating size and intrinsically high complexity. Hence, using ML to ext. relevant information from these fields is of paramount importance to advance our understanding of chem. and biomol. systems. At the heart of ML approaches lie statistical algorithms, which by evaluating a portion of a given data set, identify, learn, and manipulate the underlying rules that govern the whole data set.

(American Chemical Society) This work presents a comprehensive anal. of the biodegrdn. of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chem. modified PHB with different chem. and crystal structures in a soil environment. A polymer modification reaction was performed during prepn. of the chem. modified PHB films, utilizing 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-hexane as a free-radical initiator and maleic anhydride. Films of neat PHB and chem. modified PHB were prepd. by extrusion and thermocompression. The biol. agent employed was natural mixed microflora in the form of garden soil. The course and extent of biodegrdn. of the films was investigated by applying various techniques, as follows: a respirometry test to det. the prodn. of carbon dioxide through microbial degrdn.; SEM (SEM); optical microscopy; fluorescence microscopy; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Next-generation sequencing was carried out to study the microbial community involved in biodegrdn. of the films. Findings from the respirometry test indicated that biodegrdn. of the extruded and chem. modified PHB followed a multistage (2-3) course, which varied according to the spatial distribution of amorphous and cryst. regions and their spherulitic morphol. SEM and polarized optical microscopy (POM) confirmed that the rate of biodegrdn. depended on the availability of the amorphous phase in the interspherulitic region and the width of the interlamellar region in the first stage, while dependence on the size of spherulites and thickness of spherulitic lamellae was evident in the second stage. X-ray diffraction revealed that orthorhombic α-form crystals with helical chain conformation degraded concurrently with β-form crystals with planar zigzag conformation. The nucleation of PHB crystals after 90 days of biodegrdn. was identified by DSC and POM, a phenomenon which impeded biodegrdn. Fluorescence microscopy evidenced that the crystal structure of PHB affected the physiol. behavior of soil microorganisms in contact with the surfaces of the films. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXitVynurjJ&md5=97522dedf8a0320f182edd92109bcfe510Han, Y.; Yin, Z.; Wang, Y.; Jiang, Y.; Chen, J.; Miao, Z.; He, F.; Cheng, R.; Tan, L.; Li, K.

(American Chemical Society) Encapsulation of proteins can have advantages for their protection, stability, and delivery purposes. One of the options to encapsulate proteins is to incorporate them in complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms). This can easily be achieved by mixing aq. solns. of the protein and an oppositely charged neutral-hydrophilic diblock copolymer. However, protein-contg. C3Ms often suffer from salt-inducible disintegration due to the low charge d. of proteins. The aim of this study is to improve the salt stability of protein-contg. C3Ms by increasing the net charge of the protein by tagging it with a charged polypeptide. As a model protein, we used CotA laccase and generated variants with 10, 20, 30, and 40 glutamic acids attached at the C-terminus of CotA using genetic engineering. Micelles were obtained by mixing the five CotA variants with poly(N-methyl-2-vinyl-pyridinium)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PM2VP128-b-PEO477) at pH 10.8. Hydrodynamic radii of the micelles of approx. 31, 27, and 23 nm for native CotA, CotA-E20, and CotA-E40, resp., were detd. using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The encapsulation efficiency was not affected using enzymes with a polyglutamic acid tail but resulted in more micelles with a smaller no. of enzyme mols. per micelle. Furthermore, it was shown that the addn. of a polyglutamic acid tail to CotA indeed resulted in improved salt stability of enzyme-contg. C3Ms. Interestingly, the polyglutamic acid CotA variants showed an enhanced enzyme activity. This study demonstrates that increasing the net charge of enzymes through genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve the practical applicability of C3Ms as enzyme delivery systems. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38Xht1yrsLw%253D&md5=9d2c5ccf68e96917916a97e79653147413Kerr, A.; Sagita, E.; Mansfield, E.

Learn more about eLife Assessments Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods Data availability References Article and author information Metrics Abstract TIMM50, an essential TIM23 complex subunit, is suggested to facilitate the import of ~60% of the mitochondrial proteome. In this study, we characterized a TIMM50 disease-causing mutation in human fibroblasts and noted significant decreases in TIM23 core protein levels (TIMM50, TIMM17A/B, and TIMM23). Strikingly, TIMM50 deficiency had no impact on the steady-state levels of most of its putative substrates, suggesting that even low levels of a functional TIM23 complex are sufficient to maintain the majority of TIM23 complex-dependent mitochondrial proteome. As TIMM50 mutations have been linked to severe neurological phenotypes, we aimed to characterize TIMM50 defects in manipulated mammalian neurons. TIMM50 knockdown in mouse neurons had a minor effect on the steady state level of most of the mitochondrial proteome, supporting the results observed in patient fibroblasts. Amongst the few affected TIM23 substrates, a decrease in the steady state level of components of the intricate oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ribosome complexes was evident. This led to declined respiration rates in fibroblasts and neurons, reduced cellular ATP levels, and defective mitochondrial trafficking in neuronal processes, possibly contributing to the developmental defects observed in patients with TIMM50 disease. Finally, increased electrical activity was observed in TIMM50 deficient mice neuronal cells, which correlated with reduced levels of KCNJ10 and KCNA2 plasma membrane potassium channels, likely underlying the patients' epileptic phenotype. Introduction The mitochondrion is a vital organelle found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, where it is involved in numerous important cellular functions and metabolic pathways, including supplying cellular energy, assembling iron-sulphur clusters, and regulating the cell cycle, cell growth, and differentiation, programmed cell death, and synaptic transmission (Reichert and Neupert, 2004; Stehling et al., 2014; Pfanner et al., 2019). In humans, these functions are executed by ~1500 different mitochondrial proteins, of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (Filograna et al., 2021). The remaining mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded and thus imported into the mitochondria. The translocated proteins are sorted to their specific mitochondrial compartment via several intricate protein translocation pathways, including the presequence pathway, which is used for the import of nearly ~60% of the mitochondrial proteins (Schmidt et al., 2010; Pfanner, 2016). The TIM23 complex mediates the import of some intermembrane space (IMS) proteins, many mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) proteins, and all mitochondrial matrix proteins (Mokranjac and Neupert, 2010). The TIM23 complex in yeast comprises three essential subunits, Tim23, Tim17, and Tim50 (TIMM23, TIMM17A/B, and TIMM50 in mammals). Association of Tim21 (TIMM21 in mammals) and Mgr2 (ROMO1 in mammals) promotes the lateral translocation of proteins into the MIM, while the association of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) complex with the TIM23 core promotes the import of matrix proteins (Mokranjac et al., 2005; Ieva et al., 2014; Richter et al., 2019). Recent structural analysis showed that Tim17 forms the protein translocation path, whereas the associated Tim23 protein likely plays a structural role, serving as a platform that mediates the association of other complex subunits (Sim et al., 2023; Fielden et al., 2023). Tim50, first discovered in yeast some two decades ago (Geissler et al., 2002; Mokranjac et al., 2003), is thought to be the first TIM23 complex component to interact with presequences of precursor proteins as they emerge from the Tom40 channel, thus playing a pivotal role in presequence-containing protein sorting (Yamamoto et al., 2002). It was further suggested that normal Tim50 functionality is required for maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential (Meinecke et al., 2006). Additionally, TIMM50, the mammalian homologue of Tim50, was shown to be involved in steroidogenesis and plays a preventive role in pathological cardiac hypertrophy and several types of cancer (Bose et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017; Sankala et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). Recently, TIMM50 has generated immense interest in human health research, as mutations in the encoding gene have been linked in geographically and ethnically varied populations to the development of a severe disease characterized by mitochondrial epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, optic atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. To date, seven different mutations have been identified in children from ten unrelated families (Serajee, 2015; Shahrour et al., 2017; Tort et al., 2019; Reyes et al., 2018; Mir et al., 2020; Moudi et al., 2022). Although TIMM50 mutants are mostly associated with neurological disorders, functional characterization of TIMM50 has yet to be reported in neuronal cells. Additionally, despite being involved in the import of nearly 60% of the mitochondrial proteins, the impact of TIMM50 deficiency on the entire mitochondrial proteome has yet to be characterized. In this study, using a proteomics approach, we show the impact of TIMM50 deficiency on the mitochondrial and cellular proteome and characterize, for the first time, the neurological role of TIMM50 by knocking it down in mouse neurons. Results TIMM50 disease-causing mutation reduces the levels of TIM23 complex components in patient fibroblasts A previous study reported the clinical features of a rare genetic disease in several patients from two unrelated Arab families residing in Israel and Palestine (Shahrour et al., 2017). Patients suffering from the disease exhibited various neurological and metabolic disorders, including epilepsy, developmental delay, optic atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. The disease was linked to a homozygous missense mutation resulting in T149M replacement in the TIMM50 gene (Figure 1A). To unravel the molecular basis of the disease, we examined the effect of the mutation on the proteome of primary fibroblasts collected from two affected family members (P1 and P2), as well as from a healthy relative (HC).

We next examined the effect of the TIMM50 mutation on other components of the TIM23 complex. Notably, our analysis revealed a significant reduction in the levels of the core TIM23 complex subunits, namely, TIMM23, TIMM17A, and TIMM17B (Figure 1B and C). These results are in agreement with previous reports showing that two other TIMM50 mutations (resulting in R217Q+G372 S and S112*+G190 A replacements, both compound heterozygous) also led to major decreases in TIMM50, TIMM23, and TIMM17A/B levels (Tort et al., 2019; Reyes et al., 2018). In contrast to the decreased levels of TIM23 complex core components seen in the patient fibroblasts, the levels of subunits belonging to the PAM complex were not affected, despite their expected import dependency on the TIM23 complex. TIMM21 also showed minimal to no change in amount. Additionally, as subunits of the TOM complex that serves as the general import pore in the outer membrane were shown to interact with TIM23 complex subunits, including TIMM50 (Shiota et al., 2011), we also considered the possible effect of reduced TIMM50 levels on the expression of TOM complex subunits. No changes in the levels of TOM complex subunits addressed in patient fibroblasts were noted (Figure 1B and C). Finally, as TIM23 is known to be the sole gateway into the mitochondrial matrix (Mokranjac and Neupert, 2010), we examined the effect of TIMM50 mutation on the steady state levels of the matrix proteins aconitase 2 and mtHsp60. Surprisingly, the steady state levels of both proteins were unchanged in patient fibroblasts (Figure 1A and B), despite the significant loss of TIMM50, TIMM23, and TIMM17A/B. Generating a neuronal model system to study the neurophysiological effects of TIMM50 deficiency As TIMM50 mutations lead to severe neurodevelopmental symptoms and to a significant reduction in steady-state TIMM50 levels (Figure 1 and Tort et al., 2019; Reyes et al., 2018) we wanted to study the effects of TIMM50 deficiency in neuronal cells by knocking down TIMM50 in mouse primary cortical neurons. For this purpose, we designed three shRNA sequences (termed Sh1, Sh2, and Sh3; vector schemes are presented in Figure 2A) and cloned them into a lentiviral vector that also allows for EGFP expression under the control of the hSyn promotor (Ben-Simon et al., 2015). These vectors allow TIMM50 knockdown (KD) while specifically labeling neurons with EGFP, allowing for efficient visualization in single-cell experiments. We compared TIMM50 expression relative to three controls, namely, an untreated control (i.e. cultures that were not transduced), a pLL3.7 control (i.e. cultures that were transduced but did not transcribe the shRNA sequence, yet expressed EGFP), and a shRNA system activation control (i.e. cultures that were transduced with a scrambled shRNA sequence). All the three targeting shRNA sequences had an impact on TIMM50 levels, in comparison to the controls. Sh2 had the most significant and consistent effect, reducing TIMM50 levels by ~80% (Figure 2B and C). Therefore, Sh2 was chosen as the KD vector for all subsequent experiments on neurons.

(A) Schematic depictions of the different constructs used in this study. 'pLL3.7 control' is a control for EGFP expression.

(C) Band density analysis of the blots presented in B (and in Figure 2—source data 1; Figure 2—source data 2) shows a significant decrease in levels of TIMM50, TIMM23, and TIMM17A/B, but not in TIMM21, presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) subunits, TOM subunits, and matrix TIM23 complex substrates.

In complete agreement with the fibroblast results, the levels of TIMM23 and TIMM17A/B were significantly decreased, while the amounts of TIMM21, PAM subunits, TOM subunits, and the matrix substrates tested were not affected (Figure 2B and C). Hence, similarly to what was detected in fibroblasts, steady-state levels of several representative mitochondrial proteins were not affected in TIMM50 KD neurons. TIMM50 deficiency does not affect the steady-state levels of a majority of its substrates It was expected that the significant decrease in the levels of TIM23 core components seen upon TIMM50 deficiency would decrease the levels of substrates processed by this translocation complex. The observation that steady-state levels of two mitochondrial matrix substrates, mtHsp60 and aconitase 2, were not affected by the significant loss of TIM23 core components in both research systems (Figures 1A, B ,, 2B and C), motivated us to examine the impact of TIMM50 KD on the total mitochondrial and cellular proteomes. For this purpose, we performed untargeted mass spectrometry analysis of fibroblasts from both patients, as compared to the healthy control, and of mice primary neurons transduced with either Sh2 or the Scr control. For fibroblasts, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to verify that the replicates of both patients were consistently different from the HC replicates (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). In the case of fibroblasts, 127 MIM and 190 matrix proteins were detected using mass spectrometry (Source data 1 and 2). Surprisingly, we noticed that the levels of 83 (~65%) MIM proteins and 135 (~71%) matrix proteins were not affected in either patient, as compared to the HC (Figure 3A and B and Source data 1 and 2). Among the MIM proteins that were not affected by the TIMM50 mutation, we identified multiple proteins involved in calcium homeostasis (such as MICU2, SLC25A3, and LETM1), heme synthesis (such as PPOX and CPOX), and cardiolipin synthesis (HADHA). Among matrix proteins that were not affected by TIMM50 mutation, we identified multiple proteins involved in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (such as NFS1, GLRX5, and ISCU), detoxification (such as PRDX5, SOD2, ABHD10, and GSTK1), fatty acid oxidation (such as DECR1, ECHS1 and ETFA), and amino acid metabolism (PYCR1, ALDH18A1, and HIBCH). Also, the majority of TCA cycle proteins, such as ACO2, DLST, IDH3B, and OGDH, found in the matrix, were not affected in patient fibroblasts. Interestingly, every MIM protein that changed significantly in both patients, appeared to be downregulated, while the significantly changed matrix proteins comprised of both downregulated and upregulated proteins (Figure 3C). Unexpectedly, a few matrix proteins (ALDH2, GRSF-1, AK4, LACTB2, and OAT) showed increased steady-state levels in both patients (Figure 3C). Of these proteins, ALDH2 and GRSF-1 showed ~15 and ~sixfold increases, respectively, as was also confirmed by immunoblot (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Figure 3 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset TIMM50 deficiency leads to a specific reduction in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRP) machineries but does not affect the majority of mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) and mitochondrial matrix proteome. Untargeted mass spectrometry analysis of fibroblasts from both patients (P1, P2), as compared to the healthy control. In the volcano plots displayed in (A, B) and in all subsequent figures, the y-axis cut-off of >1.301 corresponds to –log (0.05) or p-value = 0.05, while the x-axis cut-off of <−0.5 and >0.5 corresponds to a ±1.414 fold change. Each dot in the graph represents a protein. Proteins depicted on the right side of the x-axis cut-off and above the y-axis cut-off were considered to be increased in amount, while proteins depicted on the left side of the x-axis cut-off and above the y-axis cut off were considered to be decreased in amount. All relevant proteins that were increased/decreased in amount are identified by their gene name, next to the dot. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. n=9 per group (three biological repeats in triplicate), P1 and P2 results were compared to healthy control (HC) results. Full list of differentially expressed proteins in fibroblasts is found in Files 1-2Source data 1 and 2. (A) The steady-state levels of a majority of MIM proteins detected in patient fibroblasts were not affected. MIM proteins are colored red, while other detected mitochondrial proteins are colored gray. (B) The steady-state levels of a majority of matrix proteins detected in patient fibroblasts were not affected. Matrix proteins are colored red, while other detected mitochondrial proteins are colored gray. (C) Correlation plot comparing the log-fold-change of P1 to that of P2 showing that out of the proteins that were significantly changed for both patients, MIM proteins are consistently downregulated, while matrix proteins are both upregulated and downregulated. (D) Correlation plot comparing the log-fold-change of P1 to that of P2 showing that OXPHOS and MRP proteins comprise nearly all the proteins that were downregulated in both patients. Oxidative phosphorylation subunits and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins comprise the majority of down-regulated proteins in TIMM50-deficient fibroblasts A total of 69 oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and 27 mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRP) were detected in fibroblasts by mass spectrometry. Remarkably, of the 18 MIM proteins found in decreased amounts in both patients, 17 belong to the OXPHOS family, while of the seven matrix proteins found in decreased amounts in both patients, four proteins belong to the MRP family (Figure 3D). The OXPHOS complexes most affected were CI, CII, and CIV. In the case of CI, one membrane core subunit (MT-ND1), two hydrophilic core subunits (NDUFS1 and NDUFV2), and four super-numerary subunits (NDUFA2, NDUFA10, NDUFB3, and NDUFS5) exhibited a significant negative fold-change in both patients (Source data 1 and Source data 2). The levels of two CII subunits, namely, SDHA and SDHB, and eight CIV subunits, including the two catalytic subunits MT-CO1 and MT-CO2, were also significantly decreased in both patients. GO term analysis performed on all the genes that were downregulated in both patients, confirmed enrichments of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, several OXPHOS-related processes, and mitochondrial ribosome subunits (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). Interestingly, as mentioned above, several mitochondrially encoded OXPHOS subunits were found to be downregulated. These subunits are translated by the mitochondrial ribosomes and assembled into the MIM by the oxidase assembly (OXA) insertase (Itoh et al., 2021). Therefore, these subunits are not directly related to TIM23 import. To elucidate the reason behind the downregulation of these proteins, we tested the levels of the OXA insertase by immunoblotting and found no significant difference in its levels between the patient fibroblasts and the HC (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B and C). Therefore, we conclude that the decreased levels of MRP subunits likely lead to lower translation rates of mitochondrially encoded OXPHOS subunits and consequently, to their lower abundance in the MIM. The impact of TIMM50 deficiency on the mitochondrial proteome in neurons In TIMM50 KD neurons, 170 MIM and 215 matrix proteins were detected by mass spectrometry (Source data 3). Similar to the observations for fibroblasts, the majority of the MIM and matrix proteins were not affected by TIMM50 KD (Figure 4A and B). OXPHOS and MRP subunits showed a similar trend to what was observed in patient fibroblasts and appeared to be mostly downregulated, although the affected OXPHOS subunits appeared to decrease to a lesser extent (Figure 4C and D). The difference in the extent of fold-change in neurons, as compared to patient fibroblasts, could be due to the short duration of KD in the neuronal experiment, as compared to that with the patient fibroblasts, that constantly carry the deficiency.

Full list of differentially expressed proteins in neurons is found in Source data 3. (A) The steady-state levels of a majority of mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) proteins detected in TIMM50 knockdown (KD) neuronal cells were not affected.

(B) The steady-state levels of a majority of matrix proteins detected in TIMM50 KD neuronal cells were not affected. Matrix proteins are colored red, while other detected mitochondrial proteins are colored gray. (C) Most OXPHOS subunits are observed to be in decreased amounts in TIMM50 KD neuronal cells, albeit at a lower extend from what was observed in patient fibroblasts. OXPHOS proteins are colored red, while other detected mitochondrial proteins are colored gray. (D) Decreased steady-state levels of multiple mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRP) subunits were observed in TIMM50 KD neuronal cells. MRP proteins are colored red, while other detected mitochondrial proteins are colored gray. (E, F) Mitochondrial DNA content in fibroblasts (E) and neurons (F) was not affected in TIMM50 deficient cells compared to control cells. Mitochondrial DNA content was estimated by measuring the ratio between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Dloop1 expression was measured by qPCR relative to hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT); TERT served as a control of a nuclear-encoded gene. Ethidium bromide (EtBr; 100 ng/ml) was used as the positive control. Data are shown as means ± SEM, n=6 (samples from three biological replicates, each performed twice), *p-value <0.05, ***p-value <0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test. Additionally, to determine whether the changes observed in the levels of OXPHOS and MRP proteins were an indirect effect resulting from general mitochondrial DNA loss, we performed a qPCR assessment of the mitochondrial DNA content. Our results showed no effect on mitochondrial DNA levels in either model system (Figure 4E and F), thereby confirming that the observed effects on the OXPHOS and MRP protein levels were the direct and specific result of TIMM50 deficiency, and not indirectly due to mitochondrial DNA loss. Overall, we conclude that translocation of the majority of MIM and matrix proteins was not affected in both patient fibroblasts and TIMM50 KD mice neurons, even after significant disruption of TIMM50 and the TIM23 core subunits. However, TIMM50 deficiency severely affected two major mitochondria complex systems, namely, the OXPHOS and MRP protein machineries. TIMM50 deficiency affects ATP production The observed decrease in steady-state levels of OXPHOS subunits led us to examine oxygen consumption in TIMM50-deficient cells. For this purpose, we performed the Seahorse XF cell Mito Stress test (Figure 5A). Comparing oxygen consumption rates in the HC, P1, and P2 fibroblasts, and in the Sh2- and Scr control-transduced neuronal cells revealed significant impairment of both basal and maximal respiration rates and of OXPHOS-dependent energy production rate in the non-control cells (Figure 5C and D). Overall, these results suggest that TIMM50 deficiency severely affects the OXPHOS and MRP protein machineries and leads to OXPHOS-dependent ATP deficiency in both systems. Figure 5 Download asset Open asset TIMM50 deficiency negatively impacts oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery and glycolysis functions. (A) A Seahorse XF cell mito-stress assay was used to measure mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates at basal levels and in response to the indicated effectors in fibroblasts (upper panel) and neuronal cells (lower panel). (B) A Seahorse XF cell glycolysis stress assay was used to measure glycolysis at basal levels and in response to the indicated effectors in fibroblasts (upper panel), and neuronal cells (lower panel). (C) Basal respiration, maximal respiration, and ATP-linked respiration were reduced in patient fibroblast cells compared to healthy control (HC) cells. Data are shown as means ± SEM, *p-value <0.05, ***p-value <0.001, ****p-value <0.0001, Ordinary one-way ANOVA. (D) Basal respiration, maximal respiration and ATP-linked respiration were reduced in TIMM50 KD neuronal cells compared to scrambled (Scr) control-transduced neuronal cells. Data are shown as means ± SEM, ***p-value <0.001, ****p-value <0.0001, unpaired Student's t-test. (E) Basal glycolysis remained similar, while glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserves were reduced in patient fibroblast cells compared to HC cells. Data are shown as means ± SEM, *p-value <0.05, ***p-value <0.001, ****p-value <0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test. (F) Basal glycolysis remained similar, while glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserves were reduced in TIMM50 KD neuronal cells compared to Scr control-transduced neuronal cells. Data are shown as means ± SEM, ***p-value <0.001, ****p-value <0.0001, unpaired Student's t-test. For all the experiments shown in (A–F) n=4–6 biological repeats of three to six technical repeats each. Moreover, as cells are able to meet their energetic requirements via glycolysis when the OXPHOS apparatus malfunctions (Bhattacharya, 2023), we measured the glycolytic capabilities of TIMM50-deficient cells by performing a Seahorse XF glycolysis stress test (Figure 5B). In both systems, the basal glycolysis level remained stable, in comparison to controls, suggesting that the cells did not make the metabolic switch so as to increasingly rely on the non-mitochondrial energy production pathway that is glycolysis (Figure 5E and F, left panel). Moreover, both glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserves were significantly reduced, indicative of an impaired ability of both patient fibroblasts and neurons to switch their energetic emphasis to glycolysis when needed (Figure 5E and F, middle and right panels). TIMM50 KD impairs mitochondrial trafficking in neuronal cells The transport of mitochondria within neuronal processes is crucial for cell survival (Detmer and Chan, 2007; Johri and Beal, 2012; Wang et al., 2020). Therefore, we investigated the effect of TIMM50 deficiency on mitochondrial trafficking in neuronal cells. To track individual mitochondria in neuronal processes, we used a transfection method, instead of transduction, that results in low expression efficiency in neurons (Course et al., 2017). This allowed us to visualize individual processes and track single mitochondria with minimal background noise. To visualize neuronal cells

Recent advances within bionanotechnology offer a range of exciting possibilities to improve NUE through the synthesis and tailoring of nanoparticles (NPs) with properties that might be helpful in designing the next generation of more efficient fertilizers. This includes, for example, soil-based nanofertilizers with improved accessibility to plants, as well as foliar nanofertilizers with low risk of foliar scorching, programmed release properties, and more intricate advantages such as stimulating photosynthesis through increased light harvesting, improving electron transport between the photosystems, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. (1,2) Advances within this area must develop based on interdisciplinary projects bridging plant and soil science with nanotechnology. This is a challenging task, as real advances, for the benefit of crop production and environmental health, can only be made if projects are developed based on strengths within both disciplines. Furthermore, the true impact of the science in these publications will only be realized if researchers also consider the logistics and economics of manufacturing, transport, and application, as well as the wide range of safety issues related to the use of nanoparticles in agriculture.We have previously shown that many nanotechnology-based papers focusing on agriculture are weak in experimental design, are rich in misunderstandings of basic plant and soil science, and are using unrealistic nutrient-application regimes so that the impacts of engineered nanomaterials are misinterpreted or overstated by authors. (3−6) In too many cases, it seems as if journal editors have not ensured that reviewers with both nanotechnology as well as plant and soil science competences have been recruited for the review panels.As a group of experienced plant and soil scientists, we are concerned, as we observe that an increasing amount of these papers manage to get published in reputed and society-owned journals with high impact factors, including ACS Nano, implying a threat to scientific integrity and hampering true developments within nanoenabled agriculture. The acute nature of the problem is underlined by a recent paper published in ACS Nano by Wang et al., (7) where it is claimed that application of sulfur nanoparticles to soil boosted biomass productivity up to 81% (!), while in contrast, no stimulatory effects were observed when S was applied as elemental sulfur or ionic sulfate. Wang et al. (7) attempted to explain their observations by an ability of the sulfur nanoparticles to specifically interact with and stimulate distinct sulfur dependent metabolic pathways, while at the same time stimulating quantum yield, and electron flow between the photosystems. We have used our plant and soil science competences to take a deep dive into the paper. Here we use it as an illustrative case to show how fundamental claims in publications are unsupported by the data provided due to an inadequate experimental design and a superficial interpretation of the underlying plant and soil science. Finally, we provide a range of criteria that should be considered in future papers on nanoenabled agriculture.The Growth Experiments Are FlawedClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The ability to promote biomass productivity by 70–80% in the roots and 35–50% in the shoots of unstressed plants using nanotechnology is on the verge of being sensational and will attract the attention of a wide audience across scientific disciplines including plant and soil science. In the current study, it is noted that the yield responses are measured relative to an untreated control grown in a synthetic fertilized potting mix, and it is also noted that sulfur fertilization with elemental sulfur leads to either no effect or even a growth depression relative to the control. These observations are remarkable and require a deep dive into the experimental design and results obtained.The first issue is that the growing medium has been very poorly described. Although repeatedly described by the authors as "soil", the plants were actually not grown in a natural field soil, but were grown in an artificial potting medium consisting of sphagnum peat moss (75–85%), perlite, limestone, and wetting agent (Pro-Mix BX, Premier Hort Tech, Quakertown, PA, https://www.pthorticulture.com/). Because little information is provided on the growing medium, it is not possible to know what limiting factors (if any) the plants were exposed to, including the sulfur status of the growing medium relative to plant requirements. This is an unusual situation given that the authors state that one of the driving factors for this research is that "many agricultural soils have become S deficient", yet this study does not use soil nor is it known what the S status of the growing medium was. Knowledge of the growing medium and its properties is critical in understanding the subsequent response of plants to the imposed treatments. It is difficult to assess what was done as details are vague, and it is not clear if changes in plant-available S within the "soil" are examined over time or even examined in a meaningful or accurate manner. For example, in the Supporting Information, it is stated that changes in plant-available S were examined using 0.01 M CaCl2 extraction, DTPA extraction, and DI extraction. However, it seems that the only data presented are for "deionized water suspensions" (Figure S6), and without knowledge of how these measurements were conducted (such as the soil: extractant ratio), the results cannot be interpreted in a meaningful manner.Without taking the above issues into account, readers must assume that all essential plant nutrients were present in sufficient quantities to support growth in the commercial potting mix used, although this information is not provided. Furthermore, an elemental profiling of leaf tissue containing the essential plant nutrients is also not provided, and consequently, it is not possible to evaluate if plants experienced any nutrient deficiency or any imbalance between nutrients, which is a major shortcoming for interpretation of the marked responses observed. In many plant species without nutrient deficiency stress, the shoot to root dry weight ratio usually ranges between 4 and 6, and may drop down to 1 or 2 when plants suffer from e.g. N or P deficiency. (8) In the first experiment, the shoot to root dry weight ratio was almost 1 for all S-treated plants and about 1.3 in the case of the control plants on day 16, strongly indicating a nutrient imbalance in the plants used for the experiments. The S concentrations in leaf tissue after 16 days (Experiment 1) were within the range from 0.5–0.8% S in dry matter (DM) for the plants without S supply. This is well above the critical threshold concentration for deficiency of 0.2% S in DM, (9) which indicates that none of the plants were S deficient, but rather had ample S for their requirements. It is remarkable that addition of elemental S further increased the leaf tissue concentration to 1.1–1.2% S in DM, with this being an extremely high value for well-nourished tomato plants, whereas the nano S treatments only increased tissue S marginally (insignificantly for one of the treatments). The results with the elemental S are surprising because oxidation of elemental S with a larger particle size is expected to be much slower than that of the nano S products. (10) Additionally, in the growth medium having a rather low pH (5.2 to 6.2), biological S oxidation is expected to be very low because biological S oxidation is much slower at low pH than that at alkaline soil pH. (11) However, surprisingly, the elemental S product with larger particle size increased leaf S concentration of plants from 0.6 to almost 1.2% S in DM within 4 days in a soil with rather low S oxidizing capacity, as evidenced from extractable S data in Figure S6.The above large differences in plant S acquisition and accumulation were also observed despite the dissolution in "soil" apparently being similar for elemental S and the nano-S treatments (Figure S6), although there was no indication that ultrafiltration of extracts was used to ensure that nano-S particles were separated before measurement of S in solution by ICP-OES. A substantial increase in shoot biomass was observed for both nanotreatments, whereas the elemental S treatment strikingly reduced biomass productivity. Thus, based on the information given, the reader must infer that the elemental S treatment caused S toxicity or in other ways stressed the plants, but these important aspects were not discussed by the authors. Rather, the ratio of the nano treatments relative to the elemental S treatment was mentioned to highlight the effects of the nano treatments, but we contend that this approach does not make sense.In Experiment 2, the experimental period was prolonged to 35 days, and an inorganic sulfate treatment (added as Na2SO4) was included. In addition, a treatment with half dosage compared with Experiment 1 was included. Both treatments with elemental and ionic S resulted in a similar or decreased biomass relative to the control, whereas the nano treatments increased biomass productivity. This observation is remarkable and calls for a closer inspection: if the elemental S or ionic S treatments leads to a biomass reduction relative to the control, this indicates that stress is induced in these treatments. If S was indeed limiting, these two treatments must either be similar to the control or stimulate growth. Rather, the observation that both treatments were the same or decrease growth relative to the control indicates an error within the fertilization scheme, perhaps due to an excessive S (and/or Na toxicity as sulfate was added as a sodium salt) application as indicated above.Figure S9 from Experiment 2 seems to support the idea that plants in both the elemental S and ionic sulfate treatment were indeed stressed by overfertilization. The plants shown in the photo appear generally highly heterogeneous, and the elemental S and ionic S treatments are clearly wilted and stressed in a dose-dependent manner (higher applications of S decreasing plant growth). Overall, the quality of these plants shown in the image is poor and prevents any meaningful interpretation in terms of comparisons of, e.g., biomass productivity, biochemical, and transcriptomic analyses.No evidence was provided documenting that the applied nanoparticles were taken up by the plants and the reported responses in Figure 1 could very well be caused by a changed availability and uptake of one or more essential nutrients from the soil. Based on the plant growth responses presented, the application of 200 mg S Ll–1 soil (and even 100 mg S l–1) has clearly been excessive and induced disturbances to plant growth. Fertilization with S in a large surplus will unavoidably affect the anion/cation balance of the roots, and thereby the uptake mechanisms of other essential plant nutrients. (12) Evidently, the addition of S as Na2SO4 at the given levels was a questionable choice, as evident from the photo in Figure S9. These plants are in effect dying due to salinity stress and/or S toxicity. It is unsuitable to include data from plant material of this quality in scientific papers.We consider the growth conditions described above to be a fundamental flaw, which essentially invalidates all of the conclusions drawn based on plant material produced in Experiments 1 and 2. Thus, we suggest it would be premature and unsupported by data to claim a nanospecific response with the information provided as the treatments and controls were flawed.The Claimed Effects of S Treatments on Photosynthesis Are UnjustifiedClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Chlorophyll, quantum yield, and linear electron flow (LEF) were analyzed using a portable PhotosynQ meter from PhotosynQ Inc. on the severely stressed plant material shown in Figure S9. The portable device estimates the chlorophyll concentration based on absorbance measurements at two distinct wavelengths (655 and 950 nm), at which stress-induced pigments like anthocyanins also absorb. Furthermore, the chlorophyll concentration is often used as an approximate estimate for N (sometimes also for S, Fe, etc.) concentrations in plants, but it is impossible to use chlorophyll levels to estimate photosynthesis (CO2 assimilation rates) in plants. (13) It is well-known that the chlorophyll content can vary without a concomitant change in photosynthetic rates and simple pigment absorbance measurement will not provide information on stress-induced reductions in leaf conductance. (14)Wang et al. also reported that LEF was stimulated by the nano treatments; that quantum yield was stimulated in some of them and that the elemental S and ionic S treatments were either similar or reduced relative to the control. (7) Remarkable observations of this kind must be supported by supplementary experimentation, not least because it is stated that quantum yield in the nano S treatment was improved by a massive 120% (!) relative to the control. Are we looking at a hormetic response or stress alleviation, or is it really related to an increased efficiency of light harvesting for "soil"-grown plants caused by nano S?Giraldo et al. have shown that carbon nanotubes (5 by 100 nm) are able to localize to the envelope membrane of isolated chloroplasts and increase photosynthetic rates by a factor of 3 through improved photon capture and electron transport within the photosystems. (1) Likewise, other studies have confirmed that 4 nm carbon dots are able to stimulate LEF, photosynthesis, and growth in a dose-dependent manner when fed to the root system of hydroponically grown plants, supposedly by converting damaging UV-A light into photosynthetically active light. (15) Several other papers support that photosynthesis may be stimulated by various NPs to increase light conversion and photoelectron transfer. (16) However, in the current paper, there lacks a detailed discussion of the remarkable findings related to light harvesting and electron transport, and it remains unexplained how up to 65 nm spherical nano S, or more likely clusters of those, should be acquired from "soil" by the root system, translocated, cross cell walls of mesophyll tissue and the chloroplast envelope barrier, and eventually become installed in the thylakoids to capture and transfer energy more efficiently than the control. Furthermore, the current study lacks imaging evidence and the authors refer to their previous work, also published in ACS Nano, where 2-photon confocal imaging was used to show transport of nano S from root and deposition in the shoot of soil-grown tomato. (17) However, a close inspection of the images provided in that study is far from convincing, as there seems to be a complete overlap with strong autofluorescence from the cells and there is no inclusion of appropriate controls (see Figure 1 in Supporting Information), which prevents a meaningful interpretation. The images in Figure 1 and videos in the SI, showing some unusual structures below the stomata, cannot document the existence of nano S in the leaf tissue. It is common in confocal microscopy to observe "unusual" structures such as this in leaf tissue. Also, in Wang et al., we note that the plants included in the study were of a questionable quality (see e.g. Figure 2) with heterogeneous and wilted appearance in the controls. (17)Interpretation of Transcription and Metabolome Data Appears AnecdotalClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Plant material from Experiment 1 was used for transcription and metabolome analyses with the aim of tracing responses of the S assimilation pathway to the treatments, which is problematic given the fact that the controls were flawed. Moreover, the procedures for quality control and the inclusion of housekeeping genes have not been presented clearly. The description appears to be rather anecdotal and goes beyond what the data can support; importantly, there is no functional validation for the observations made. Thus, the resulting discussion is speculative and unfortunately presents quite a few inconsistencies, which makes it difficult to follow. Below we highlight a few of these inconsistencies.Expression of the ST2.1 sulfate transporter appears to be induced by the nano S treatment at day 16 only but is downregulated in the elemental S treatment. Thus, apparently nano S leads to induction of a S starvation response whereas this is not the case for elemental S. How can this make sense given the tissue S concentrations listed in Figure 3? Likewise, the primary sulfate assimilation step (ATP-sulfurylase) seems to be unaffected by the treatments. Why is this crucial step unaffected? The same sort of questions arise when studying the expression of S assimilation genes in Figure 5, which all makes very little sense without validation.Transcription data are often prone to responses caused by stress and a range of secondary processes. Thus, it is important to note that expression of a given gene cannot be interpreted as a response at, e.g., the sulfate transporter or assimilatory pathway levels, without being backed up by parallel analyses showing data at the protein level and/or using mutants/transgenics for a functional validation. As a consequence, we conclude that it is impossible to extract solid evidence from the transcriptomic analysis using the data presented.ConclusionsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Nanotechnology has the potential to provide attractive solutions for agriculture, but it is critical that unexpected or even dramatic results are supported by solid experimentation to back up the findings. It is critical that the experimental designs are carefully planned, executed, and interpreted. In this respect, it is important that the soil and plant materials used in experiments are homogeneous between treatments, of good quality, and thoroughly characterized to allow for meaningful interpretation. There is a strong need that studies investigating the impact of NPs on plants should be hypothesis-driven and should focus on providing mechanistic insights rather than just observing effects of a given treatment of soil and plants with a nanoformulation.In drawing conclusions about the benefits of any novel nanofertilizer and its likely benefits for global agricultural production, several key points need to be considered. The vigor and nutritional health of plants in the positive control (fertilized) are critical in comparison with those of the plants exposed to a given nanoproduct. Similarly, the use of appropriate growth media that accurately represent the conditions in unfertilized natural soils is essential (i.e., good negative controls) if any novel nanofertilizer claims to offer significant nutritional benefits.Modes of nanofertilizer application to soil also need to be considered in the experimental design, as many fine-powdered materials present health issues related to human exposure, which mean that spreading and incorporation into soil is unlikely to occur as a dispersed nanopowder. In the particular case, nanosulfur represents an explosion risk in both manufacture and handling, which should be considered. Finally, the costs of manufacturing and environmental safety of any nanomaterials need to be considered and discussed.Papers on nanoenabled agriculture should occasionally move outside the nano silo in order to publish plant-based work in well-established plant and soil science journals. This will allow reviewers with in-depth expertise within the plant and soil disciplines to evaluate the work and ensure that the appropriate quality standards and perspectives are in place.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorSøren Husted - Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2020-1902; Email: [email protected]AuthorsIsmail Cakmak - Sabanci University, Faculty of Engineering & Natural Sciences, 34956 Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3183-5524Jan Kofod Schjoerring - Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2852-3298Hans Lambers - School of Biological Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6009, AustraliaPeter M.

(Nature Publishing Group) The interface between plant organelles and non-biol. nanostructures has the potential to impart organelles with new and enhanced functions. Here, we show that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) passively transport and irreversibly localize within the lipid envelope of extd. plant chloroplasts, promote over three times higher photosynthetic activity than that of controls, and enhance max. electron transport rates. The SWNT-chloroplast assemblies also enable higher rates of leaf electron transport in vivo through a mechanism consistent with augmented photoabsorption. Concns. of reactive oxygen species inside extd. chloroplasts are significantly suppressed by delivering poly(acrylic acid)-nanoceria or SWNT-nanoceria complexes. Moreover, we show that SWNTs enable near-IR fluorescence monitoring of nitric oxide both ex vivo and in vivo, thus demonstrating that a plant can be augmented to function as a photonic chem. sensor. Nanobionics engineering of plant function may contribute to the development of biomimetic materials for light-harvesting and biochem. detection with regenerative properties and enhanced efficiency. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXktlKjsLk%253D&md5=788165de2fb32e52ce78a78ab8fa959a2Santana, I.; Wu, H.; Hu, P.; Giraldo, J.

(Nature Research) Abstr.: Current approaches for nanomaterial delivery in plants are unable to target specific subcellular compartments with high precision, limiting our ability to engineer plant function. We demonstrate a nanoscale platform that targets and delivers nanomaterials with biochems. to plant photosynthetic organelles (chloroplasts) using a guiding peptide recognition motif. Quantum dot (QD) fluorescence emission in a low background window allows confocal microscopy imaging and quant. detection by elemental anal. in plant cells and organelles. QD functionalization with cyclodextrin mol. baskets enables loading and delivery of diverse chems., and nanoparticle coating with a rationally designed and conserved guiding peptide targets their delivery to chloroplasts. Peptide biorecognition provides high delivery efficiency and specificity of QD with chem. cargoes to chloroplasts in plant cells in vivo (74.6 ± 10.8%) and more specific tunable changes of chloroplast redox function than chems. alone. Targeted delivery of nanomaterials with chem. cargoes guided by biorecognition motifs has a broad range of nanotechnol. applications in plant biol. and bioengineering, nanoparticle-plant interactions, and nano-enabled agriculture. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3cXosVOhu7c%253D&md5=c5d8527f42186c570a3ef288f588fc0d3Kopittke, P.

(Royal Society of Chemistry) A review. Food prodn. must increase markedly to feed the growing human population, but this needs to be achieved while simultaneously reducing adverse environmental impacts. In this regard, there is increasing interest in the use of nanomaterials as fertilizers for improving plant mineral nutrition. In the present review, we examine the ability of nanomaterials to supply a range of nutrients, with most focus given to recent research on phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn). Some studies have demonstrated that nanomaterials can indeed be more effective than conventional fertilizers, esp. by acting as a slow release source. However, other studies have found that nanomaterials have the same effectiveness, or are even less effective, than conventional fertilizers. Thus, ongoing investigation is required to understand the conditions under which the use of nanomaterials increases efficiency. We also note that there are a comparatively large no. of stu
