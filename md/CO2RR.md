Abstract Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) offers a promising pathway for closing the carbon cycle. Metallic Cu‐based catalysts are the only materials capable of converting CO 2 to C 2+ products with significant selectivity and activity. Achieving industrially relevant current densities in CO 2 R requires the use of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), making the structure and properties of the catalyst layer (CL) on GDEs critical to the CO 2 R performance of Cu catalysts. However, limited research has explored how catalyst ink composition affects CL features and, consequently, CO 2 R performance under operating conditions. In this study, we investigate the influence of catalyst ink composition on CL structure and morphology, and how these properties affect CO 2 R performance. We find that the water content in the ink modifies active site density, thickness, and porosity of the CL, as well as the state of the Nafion binder, thereby altering the microenvironment of the active sites during CO 2 R, including local CO 2 concentration and pH. Our results reveal a strong correlation between CO 2 R performance and the structural characteristics of the CL. Specifically, optimizing the ethanol‐to‐water ratio in the catalyst ink enhances C 2+ product selectivity and current density to 75 % and 450 mA cm −2 , respectively. This approach provides a simple yet effective strategy to improve CO 2 R activity and selectivity under practical conditions.

With the progress of science and technology and the economy, realizing “sustainable development” has become the common development goal of many countries and regions in the world today. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is widely used as an important carbon resource, which aggravates the problem of global warming. electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) is a key technology for converting CO 2 into useful carbon-based products (such as C 2 H 4 , CO, CH 3 OH). Thereby increasing the economic and commercial value of clean energy worldwide. In this paper, different electrocatalysts commonly used in ECO 2 RR reactions were studied. By summarizing the definition, characteristics, deficiencies, and modification strategies of different electrocatalysts, different effects of different electrocatalysts on ECO 2 RR reaction were studied. This paper helps to make up for the shortage of different electrocatalysts in the literature review of ECO 2 RR reaction, promote the development of ECO 2 RR reaction electrocatalysts, and promote the progress of ECO 2 RR reaction. Let the ECO 2 RR reaction enable energy conservation and emission reduction, and provide more effective measures for the early realization of the “double carbon goal”. Due to the limited literature on electrocatalysts, the current research is not comprehensive. Future studies should summarize the characteristics of different electrocatalysts in ECO 2 RR reactions more comprehensively.

Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction in acidic media attracts extensive research attention due to its potential in increasing carbon efficiency. In most reports, alkali cations are introduced to suppress hydrogen evolution and to promote CO 2 reduction. However, the mass transport of alkali cations through cation exchange membrane induces the change of electrolyte compositions. Herein, the variation of electrolyte compositions and the flow of carbon during CO 2 reduction are analyzed quantitatively by simulation and experiments. If the initial amount of alkali cations in the anolyte is higher than the initial amount of H + in the catholyte, the pH of the catholyte increases remarkably in long‐term CO 2 reduction electrolysis, resulting in the decrease of carbon efficiency. Bicarbonate salt precipitation on the cathode with alkali cation‐containing catholyte is another origin of the decrease of CO 2 reduction Faradaic efficiency and carbon efficiency. To maintain high carbon efficiency, the electrolyte should contain low concentration of alkali cations or even be free of alkali cations. Decorating the catalyst of cathode with ionomer with high density of cation sites enables CO 2 reduction in pure acid solution, achieving 30‐h stable carbon efficiency.

Optimal product synthesis in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) requires a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between external voltage and microbial yield. While most studies assume constant growth yields or rely on empirical estimates, this study presents a novel thermodynamic model, linking anodic oxidation and cathodic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to methane (CH4) by growing microbial biofilm. Through integrating theoretical Gibbs free energy calculations, the model predicts electron and proton transfers for autotrophic methanogen and anode-respiring bacteria (ARB) growth, accounting for varying applied voltages and substrate concentrations. The findings identify an optimal applied cathodic potential of −0.3 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) for maximizing CH4 production under standard conditions (pH 7, 25 °C, 1 atm) regardless of ohmic losses. The model bridges the stoichiometry of anodic and cathodic biofilms, addressing research gaps in simulating anodic and cathodic biofilm growth simultaneously. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal that lower substrate concentrations require more negative voltages than standard condition to stimulate microbial growth. The model was validated using experimental data, demonstrating reasonable predictions of biomass growth and CH4 yield under different operating voltages in a multi substrate system. The results show that higher voltage inputs increase biomass yield while reducing CH4 output due to non-optimal voltage. This validated model provides a tool for optimizing BES performance to enhance CH4 recovery and biofilm stability. These insights contribute to finding optimum voltage for the highest CH4 production for energy efficient CO2 reduction for scaling up BES technology.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) on copper electrodes in acetonitrile (MeCN) solutions offers a promising route for converting CO2 into valuable products, but it competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This study systematically explores the impact of varying water content in MeCN on the selectivity and efficiency of CO2RR and HER. Through cyclic voltammetry, we observe that increasing water content shifts onset potentials and Tafel slopes, indicating changes in reaction mechanisms and rate‐determining steps. In dry MeCN, CO2RR is predominant due to high CO2 solubility and limited proton availability. As water content increases, HER kinetics improve significantly, eventually dominating the reaction at higher water concentrations. In situ FTIR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that water preferentially adsorbs onto the copper electrode surface, enhancing the stabilization of reaction intermediates and facilitating HER. Additionally, the clustering of water in MeCN plays a crucial role in the observed reaction dynamics, with water clusters influencing the availability and reactivity of surface‐bound species. These findings provide critical insights into optimizing electrochemical systems for selective CO2 reduction by controlling water content, offering a pathway for improved electrocatalytic performance.

Batch cells are pivotal in advancing the foundational research of CO2 reduction by providing precise control over reaction conditions to study catalyst behavior and reaction mechanisms, generating insights that drive the development of scalable systems like flow reactors and ultimately supporting sustainability through the industrial adoption of carbon-neutral technologies. Therefore, a one-dimensional numerical model is developed to study electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions in a batch cell with three different working electrode configurations: solid electrode, glassy carbon electrode, and gas-diffusion-layer electrode. The experimental results of two Cu-based catalysts are used to obtain electrochemical kinetic parameters and to validate the numerical model. The simulation results demonstrate that both gas-diffusion-layer electrodes and glassy carbon electrodes with porous catalyst layers have superior performance over solid electrodes in terms of total current density. Furthermore, we studied the impact of the key parameters of batch cells with glassy carbon electrodes, such as boundary-layer thickness, catalyst-layer thickness, catalyst-layer porosity, electrolyte nature, and the strength of an electrolyte relative to the total current density at a fixed applied cathodic potential of −1.0 V vs. RHE.

Concentrated solar‐driven CO2 reduction is a breakthrough approach to combat climate crisis. Harnessing the in‐situ coupling of high photon flux density and high thermal energy flow initiates multiple energy conversion pathways, such as photothermal, photoelectric, and thermoelectric processes, thereby enhancing the efficient activation of CO2. This review systematically presents the fundamental principles of concentrated solar systems, the design and classification of solar‐concentrating devices, and industrial application case studies. Meanwhile, key technological advances–from theoretical foundations to practical applications–are also discussed. At the microscopic level, a comprehensive analysis of multiscale reaction kinetics within the domain of photothermal synergistic catalysis has been conducted. This analysis elucidates the significance of catalyst design, further detailing the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing reaction pathways and active sites through nanostructured catalysts, single‐atom catalysts, and metal‐support interactions. However, the transition from laboratory research to industrial‐scale application still faces challenges, including the complexity of system integration, energy density optimization, and economic feasibility. This review provides a theoretical framework and practical guidance through a complete investigation of current technological bottlenecks and future development directions, with the aim of driving key advances in concentrated solar‐driven CO2 reduction catalysis.

With the acceleration of global industrialization, the issue of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has become increasingly severe, highlighting the urgent need to develop effective CO2 capture and utilization technologies. CO2 absorption-mineralization technology, as an emerging method, can convert CO2 into solid minerals, achieving both long-term storage and emission reduction goals. This paper systematically reviews the latest research progress in CO2 absorption-mineralization technology, with a particular focus on its application potential and sustainability in the steel industry. Additionally, it summarizes the research status and optimization strategies of various monoamine and mixed amine absorbents and explores the main process technologies, reaction mechanisms, and key parameters of industrial CO2 mineralization. Through multiscale modeling analysis, the study delves into the reaction mechanisms and influencing factors of the mineralization process, providing theoretical support for the industrial application of the technology. The research indicates that CO2 absorption-mineralization technology not only effectively reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also offers raw materials for industries such as construction, thus promoting sustainable resource development. Although this technology shows good application prospects, it still faces key challenges in economic viability and technical feasibility during practical implementation. This paper aims to clarify the current research hotspots and challenges, providing theoretical and practical support for future large-scale application.

Developing high‐activity and long‐term stable electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to valuable products is still a challenge. An in‐depth understanding of reaction mechanisms and the structure‐function relationship is required for the development of an advanced catalytic eCO2RR system. Herein, a coordination polymer of indium(III) and benzenehexathiol (BHT) was developed as an electrocatalyst (In‐BHT) for eCO2RR to HCOO−, which displayed an outstanding catalytic performance over the entire pH range. However, experimental results revealed significantly different catalytic pathways in the acid and neutral/alkaline solutions, which are attributed to the influence of redox non‐innocent ligands on the rate‐determining step (RDS). In the acid solution, the RDS is the formation of *OCOH intermediate through the proton transfer that originates from H2O in the solution, leading to relatively sluggish kinetics. But in the neutral or alkaline solution, the thiolate groups could be protonated during the catalytic process, and such proton can attack on carbon of absorbed CO2 via an intramolecular proton transfer, promoting the formation of *OCHO intermediate, resulting in faster kinetics. Our findings revealed the pivotal roles of the redox non‐innocent ligands of metal active sites for eCO2RR, providing a new idea for designing highly efficient electrocatalysts.

The large amount of CO2 in the atmosphere cannot be sequestered by the technology now in use to reduce CO2 emissions. The progress of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration by its conversion into calcite was covered in the study, along with contemporary viewpoints on the subject. The process occurs in either geological or biological systems. Nevertheless, compared to bio-sequestration, geological sequestration is a more costly and slower process. Recently, research has investigated the use of microorganisms like bacteria and algae for the bio-sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into the soil. One potential future technique to lower high CO2 pollution is the inclusion of fungal species in the bio-concrete bricks and their ability to bio-sequester CO2. Fungal cells can capture CO2 by accelerating the carbonation processes, which convert carbon-dioxide into calcium carbonate (CaCO3) via carbon anhydrase and urease enzymes. It produces carbon anhydrases (CA) and urease enzymes to accelerate the sequestration process of CO2. The present paper aimed to highlight and discuss the applicability of fungi in the Bio-concrete for capturing and storing CO2. It is evident from the literature that the new trends to use bio-concrete might contribute to the reduction of CO2 by accelerating the carbonation process and strengthening the concrete.

The cupola furnace is a type of melting furnace used in foundries for melting cast iron. The primary purpose of studying the emission of gases in the cupola furnace is to understand and mitigate environmental and operational impacts. Emission research in the cupola furnace involves the analysis of gases released during the melting process. The key gases of interest include carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Environmental Impact: Understanding the composition and quantity of emissions helps in assessing the environmental impact of cupola furnace operations. This is crucial for compliance with environmental regulations and standards. Studying gas emissions provides insights into the combustion efficiency and overall performance of the cupola furnace. It allows for optimization of the process to enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions. Worker Health and Safety: Monitoring emissions is essential to ensure a safe working environment for foundry workers. At Foundry E&E, a total of 7800 kg of pig iron is produced during one scrap smelting. Measurements of process gases in the working spaces and in the chimney exceed the standard values of CO2 and CO quantities. We performed the measurements with the "aeroqual-gas sensing" series 500 apparatus. The amount of CO2 near the scarp melting cupola furnace was 325 ppm, while the amount of CO2 in the chimney reached the value of 2047 ppm. The aim of the work is to achieve the reduction of metallurgical coke, and the return of the process gas through the blowers in the areas of the cupola furnace in the Foundry E&E, and with this we will achieve the reduction of CO2

Electroorganic reduction reactions are canonically carried out at a cathode at which a significant negative potential is applied. Specifically, aryl bromides and chlorides undergo heterogeneous reduction in organic solvents at potentials more negative than –2 V vs E0’ for the Fc/Fc+ couple (Fc = ferrocene). To decrease the overpotential for reduction reactions, electrocatalysis strategies are often employed. Here, we present an electrochemical method to reduce aryl bromides and chlorides that is initiated by an oxidation reaction at very mild potentials (~ 0 V vs Fc/Fc+). Specifically, electrochemical oxidation of an outer-sphere redox mediator, 1,1-dimethylferrocene, in dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) containing oxalate (C2O42–), results in the homogeneous one-electron oxidation of C2O42–. The resulting C2O4•– decomposes in ~1 µs to release the carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2•–), a potent reductant that is oxidized to CO2 at –2.68 V vs Fc/Fc+. In this way, an oxidation reaction at very low electrode potentials enables the homogeneous reduction of aryl bromides and chlorides, which are otherwise directly reduced at very negative potentials. Using this method, selective hydrodehalogenations of electron-deficient aryl bromides and chlorides are carried out at a reticulated vitreous carbon anode with up to quantitative conversion yields. Cyclic voltammetry and finite difference simulations are used to characterize the hydrodehalogenation of 4-bromobenzonitrile via C2O42– oxidation. Additionally, we show that the efficiency of hydrodehalogenation can be tuned by deliberate additions of water to the DMF solutions, leading to a substantial improvement in overall conversion yields without interference from water or proton reduction.

Policy synergy, the evidence-based coordination of public policies, can aid in more rapidly achieving air pollutant and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction targets. Using logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition, coupling coordination degree (CCD), and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models, we analyzed the emission characteristics, drivers, and reduction pathways of residential air pollution across 30 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2020. The southern provinces produced more air pollution than the northern provinces, with the gap widening after 2015. In the residential sector, energy emission factors (LMDI decomposition result, 686,681.9) and population size (14,331) had greater impacts on air pollutant emissions than the energy structure, energy intensity, synergies, or GDP per capita. The GTWR analysis of the CCD mechanism indicated that hydroelectricity and urbanization enhanced coupling coordination in the southeast. Meanwhile, in the west, coupling coordination was improved by R&D investment, government spending on industrial pollution control, electricity consumption, per capita cropland, temperature, and urbanization. This analysis provides a valuable reference for optimizing emission reduction strategies.

Predicting fuel consumption in the shipping industry is a critical task that supports optimized operations, driving both economic and environmental benefits as global demand for shipping continues to grow. However, accurately forecasting Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions is challenging due to the complexity and volume of operational data. In this study, we developed and evaluated the Random Forest model to measure the prediction accuracy. The Random Forest model achieved a high predictive accuracy, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.046, demonstrating its robustness in capturing the non-linear relationships in the data. Feature importance analysis within the Random Forest model highlighted vessel length, gross tonnage, width, and draft as key predictors of fuel consumption, offering valuable insights into CO2 emissions-reduction strategies. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning to empower data-driven decisions in the maritime sector. Future work will explore further optimization of the Random Forest model, incorporate additional predictive features, and investigate real-time applications to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability. By making accurate CO2 emission predictions, this research contributes to the industry’s efforts to achieve sustainable and environmentally responsible shipping practices.    

    

## Systematic Feasibility Assessment of Geomechanical Risks for CO2 Injection and Long-Term Storage Incorporating Rock Properties Degradation and Thermal Effects

ABSTRACT: As part of carbon capture and storage feasibility assessment, geomechanical risk analysis is conducted in field of interest to determine maximum injection pressure and associated geomechanical risks during injection and long-term storage. The objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of injecting and storing CO2 in the field by assessing CO2 containment and leakage risks, in particular "showstoppers", for decision-making on progressing to comprehensive coupled geomechanical study and mature the field as a CO2 storage site. Using the rock mechanical properties from calibrated 1D geomechanical models as input, caprock integrity analysis is conducted and maximum injection pressure is determined to ensure the caprock does not experience tensile and shear failure during CO2 injection. If there are faults penetrating the caprock and reservoir of interest, fault stability analysis is conducted on the faults to ensure they remain stable with reduction in maximum injection pressure, if required. Rock properties degradation due to CO2-rock interaction and thermal effects on geomechanical containment risks are incorporated by using rock properties degradation and thermal properties database of the area and estimated temperature changes in the reservoir and caprock. Upon finalization of the maximum injection pressure, reservoir expansion and surface uplift are conducted to determine the maximum uplift. The methodology has been applied to one of the CO2 storage candidates located in offshore Peninsular Malaysia. Changes of minimum horizontal stress at caprock during reservoir pressure increase were calculated to determine the injection pressure that will cause tensile or shear failure. Fault stability analyses were conducted on all the faults intersecting the formations of interest by using the rock strength and stress properties from the nearest well to the faults, and the faults were found to remain stable. Finally, reservoir expansion for each of the formations of interest was calculated and used as part of the input for seabed uplift analysis. Low seabed uplift was determined at the end of injection and will not affect the surface facility integrity. 1. INTRODUCTION One of the best alternative methods of produced carbon dioxide (CO2) disposal to meet net zero carbon emission is CO2 capture and geological storage. With more countries committed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emission following their ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement, there has been increasing global interest in the geological storage (Baklid et al., 1996, Bissell et al., 2011, Mustafa et al., 2021 and Tewari et al., 2022). However, there are numerous geomechanical challenges and risks associated with CO2 injection and storage in depleted reservoirs, saline aquifers and dry geological structures that are required to be addressed. The key challenges include maintaining the seal integrity throughout the injection operation and storage life. The pressure and temperature changes will give rise to changes in stresses and pose risks to fault re-activation and breach of caprock integrity. These processes and mechanisms can be complex and need to be modelled simultaneously as they inter-relate between them (Tan et al., 2022 and Chidambaram et al., 2023). A comprehensive assessment of the geomechanical-related risks to manage CO2 containment and mitigate leakage risks requires a coupled geomechanical study (Masoudi et al., 2011, Masoudi et al., 2013, Chidambaram et al., 2021 and Mustafa et al., 2022). However, it is resource intensive and time-consuming which are not warranted for preliminary feasibility assessment of potential CO2 geological storage site. An analytical approach based on 1D geomechanical models may be implemented instead which is solely for preliminary assessement of the risks. The goal is to identify any "showstoppers" from geomechanical perespective that will make the geological structure to be not viable as CO2 storage site (Musa at al., 2023 and Tan et al., 2024).

Deep hole drilling is a complex process, especially with heat-generating high-strength alloys like Inconel 718. Key challenges include heat management and effective chip removal to preserve tool life, hole accuracy, and surface finish. This method is ideal for applications like gun barrels, fuel lines, lubricant channels, and aircraft components. While cutting fluids cool and lubricate, they can cause health issues. Cryogenic coolants offer an eco-friendly, safer alternative that enhances machining performance. This study constitutes an experimental investigation of deep-hole drilling processes performed on a GUNDRILL CNC machine. The primary objective is to establish a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between cutting speed, feed rate, and various coolants concerning key performance indicators, including surface roughness, hole wall temperature, hole quality, material removal rate and tool wear. The coolants considered in this study encompass traditional cutting oil, cryogenic liquid nitrogen (LN2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in cryogenic form. The use of cryogenic LN2 coolant during Inconel 718 machining led to a significant reduction in hole wall temperature compared to wet and cryogenic CO2 deep-hole drilling. This was due to the low temperature of LN2, which allowed efficient heat dissipation from the contact zone. LN2 also improved surface roughness by 29-55% compared to traditional oil coolant and 22-39% compared to cryogenic CO2 cooling. Additionally, cryogenic LN2 cooling decreased circularity error by 12-22% compared to oil coolant and 8-21% compared to cryogenic CO2 conditions. The cryogenic LN2 coolant enhanced chip breakability and extended tool life without damaging the cutting-edge insert.

Densely populated countries have higher demand for agricultural products and greater use of fuel and vehicles, resulting in higher environmental emissions, so this study considers transportation infrastructure and the agricultural sector as the two major drivers of environmental degradation in the top five densely populated countries. In a baseline regression, this study first unveils the impact of investments in transportation infrastructure, agricultural value addition, and environment-related technologies on per capita CO2 emissions using CS-ARDL approach from 1990 to 2021 in the five most populous countries. Besides, this study also reveals the typical moderating effect of environment-related technologies in the link between transport infrastructure, agricultural value added and environmental hazards. The results of the baseline model indicate that transport infrastructure and agricultural value added can substantially contribute to per capita carbon emissions in both the short and long term. However, environment-related technologies significantly reduce environmental emissions in both the short and long term. Per capita GDP extensively promotes per capita carbon dioxide emissions, while per capita GDP2 substantially reduces per capita carbon dioxide emissions in the long term rather than the short term, thus authenticating the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis for the top five countries with the highest population density. The moderating effect of environment-related technologies shows that the application of environment-related technologies in both transportation and agriculture can alleviate environmental pollution. Finally, the threshold level of environment-related technologies shows that as environment-related technologies move from lower threshold levels (≤ − 1.05) to higher threshold levels (> -1.05), agricultural value added and transportation infrastructure investment significantly improve the reduction of environmental contamination. The goal of environmental sustainability can be ensured by the adoption of environment-related technologies in agriculture and transportation sectors.

Many developed and developing countries are concerned about climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, with landfills being a major contributor due to the presence of important GHGs such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in landfill emissions. The appropriate technology or suitable innovation could result in the extraction of significant amounts of energy from CH4 in landfills. This work used landfill gas emissions (LandGEM) software modeling to analyze the distribution patterns of the gas emissions of two urban landfills in Chonburi and Phuket Provinces, Thailand, from 2013 to 2023. The methane emissions from the Chonburi landfill were 1.063 × 104 Mg/year, and they were 1.077 × 103 Mg/year for the Phuket landfill, in 2023. According to estimates, the Chonburi landfill emitted 2.916 × 104 Mg/year of CO2 in 2023, while Phuket emitted 2.955 × 103 Mg/year. The Chonburi landfill generated 8.67 MWh/year and 195.74 MWh/year of electrical energy potential from CH4 in 2014 and 2023. In 2014 and 2023, the electrical energy potential from CH4 was 1.00 MWh/year and 19.83 MWh/year for the Phuket landfill. This study’s results show that landfills can produce CH4 and that it is possible to collect this gas and stop GHG emissions from entering the atmosphere. This would be beneficial for local authorities considering the potential of landfill gas.

In the digital economy era, increasing government’s adoption and attention to digital technology is not only conducive to accelerating the improvement of governance capacity, but also an important measure to achieve green economic development. This paper uses text analysis to measure the government digital attention at the city level, and then uses panel data econometric models to estimate the impact of government digital attention on carbon emissions reduction. The findings reveal that government digital attention can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving the government’s low-carbon governance, strengthening the public’s low-carbon attention, and encouraging the enterprises’ low-carbon transformation. Further, government digital attention mainly reduces carbon dioxide from direct energy consumption, transportation and electricity product. The carbon reduction effect of government digital attention is also affected by degree of marketization, and the high degree of marketization helps to reinforce the effect. Moreover, there is spatial heterogeneity in the effect, it is more significant in the eastern region. Our conclusions are then of important implications for promoting China’s carbon dioxide reduction and achieving high-quality sustainable development.

This study explores the links between environmental innovation, growth, quality, and renewable energy (RE) in ASEAN economies. It uses sophisticated econometric methods including Panel unit root tests, Westerlund cointegration, Augmented Mean Group and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimation, and Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality tests to understand the short run & long-term dynamics of these relationships. The study attempts to evaluate how economic growth and financial development affect environmental quality (EQ) as well as how innovation and RE can help to slow down environmental deterioration. While RE significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), the results show that environmental innovations like patents have a delayed but beneficial long-term influence on reducing emissions. Financial development also helps to reduce emissions over the long run despite economic growth and the burning of fossil fuels increasing emissions. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test shows that these factors reinforce each other, requiring coordinated policy actions. The report suggests ASEAN nations prioritize RE and environmental innovation for long-term emission reductions. For sustainable development, financial markets must be expanded to accommodate green financing programs such as green bonds. Decoupling economic growth from the use of fossil fuels is also necessary to ensure a sustainable future.

THE PURPOSE. Study of extraction processes of plant raw materials with a wide range of biologically active properties, supercritical carbon dioxide used as a solvent, as well as with the addition of ethanol, used as a co-solvent, to supercritical carbon dioxide in a ratio of 5% to the total consumption at a temperature of 313 K and pressure 30 MPa. METHODS. The study of extraction processes was carried out by the method of supercritical fluid extraction, which is effective and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods for obtaining extracts. The experimental setup, equipped with two plunger pumps, allowed the implementation of a dynamic extraction method with both supercritical carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide with the addition of ethanol. RESULTS. The final extract yields were obtained for Valeriána officinális, Hypericum, Matricaria and Salvia at a temperature of 313 K and a pressure of 30 MPa using pure carbon dioxide and a carbon dioxide/ethanol mixture as a solvent. Based on the results of experimental data, the dependence of the mass yield of the extract on the extraction time was plotted. This determines the extraction rate of each sample. CONCLUSION. The experimental data obtained indicate that for each of the samples of plant raw materials, the use of supercritical carbon dioxide modified with ethanol in a ratio of 95 and 5%, respectively, leads to an increase in the yield of the extract. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in energy costs when implementing the extraction process using the proposed method on an industrial scale.

The oxygen and natural gas flow rates were determined using a thermal electronic flow controller equipped with thermoresistive elements. The oxygen content of the cultural liquid was determined by means of an optical oxygen sensor with integrated transducer. The pH level in the bioreactor was monitored and maintained using an electrochemical pH sensor. Results . The efficacy of the newly devised jet-type bioreactor design, which permits the incorporation of a carbon dioxide removal unit into the fermentation system without requiring supplementary compression apparatus, was evaluated through experimentation. The system was tested with the carbon dioxide removal unit included in the design, resulting in a 64% increase in bioreactor productivity and a 18% reduction in oxygen consumption as a component of the gas supply. Conclusions . The operational parameters of a technological bioreactor that facilitate a stable continuous process of bacterial cultivation were identified.

The greenhouse effect caused by greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide emissions, has become a central issue in global environmental governance. Traditional emission reduction strategies, although effective, are difficult to meet global climate goals. In response, the scientific community has begun to explore new technologies for capturing, separating, storing and utilizing carbon dioxide through physical and chemical means. These technologies offer potential avenues for greenhouse gas (GHG) management, but still face technical, economic, and environmental challenges before large-scale application. This study systematically evaluates the progress of the application of these physical and chemical means in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) treatment, and discusses in depth the technical bottlenecks and future improvement directions by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each technology. It is hoped that this study provides a valuable theoretical basis and practical reference for the development and application of future large-scale CO 2 abatement technologies.

Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is a highly effective method for energy storage. It is essential to explore inexpensive metal catalysts that exhibit high selectivity and yield for carbon monoxide, yet this remains a significant challenge. In this study, carbon‐supported Ni–Cu bimetallic nanoparticles (denoted as Ni x Cu y NPs‐C) are synthesized through low‐temperature carbonization of Ni x Cu y ‐ZIF. The carbon matrix effectively prevents the aggregation of Ni/Cu NPs, allowing for a more uniform dispersion that exposes a greater number of active sites. The well‐conductive Ni/Cu particles facilitate electron transfer, contributing to high current density. Electrocatalytic performance tests indicate that the synthesized catalyst can efficiently convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, achieving a Faradaic efficiency for CO (FE CO ) exceeding 90% at potentials from −0.9 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) to −1.1 V (vs. RHE), with a peak FE CO of 96.37 % at −1.1 V (vs. RHE) and a total current density of 15.435 mA cm −2 .

This paper summarizes the various types of carbon dioxide treatment technology, the current situation, and the development trend, and describes the progress and challenges in the application of carbon dioxide treatment technology at the present stage. It is found that the focus of research and development should be on improving carbon capture efficiency and reducing carbon capture costs. CO 2 utilization technology is currently in the industrial demonstration stage, and breaking through the bottleneck of high temperature and high pressure environment, and searching for suitable catalysts to improve the carbon utilization efficiency are the key research directions in the next stage of CO 2 utilization technology. CO 2 treatment technology needs to overcome the challenges of economic profitability, technological innovation, cost reduction and efficiency enhancement, and policy subsidies and incentives. CO 2 bioprocessing technology will become a new mode of CO 2 treatment promotion in the future. This study is of reference significance for accurately grasping the research direction of CO 2 treatment technology, promoting the progress and innovation of CO 2 treatment technology, and accelerating the leapfrog development of CO 2 treatment technology.

Abstract This systematic review uniquely explores the impact of carbon reduction measures on human comfort from a human factors and ergonomics perspective, focusing on human comfort. An analysis of 30 papers identifies key environmental factors requiring attention in contemporary carbon reduction strategies and their implications for human comfort. The results reveal a growing emphasis on thermal comfort and air quality in carbon reduction retrofits, while other environmental factors such as light and noise receive insufficient attention. While optimal ventilation and local environmental adjustments can yield positive outcomes, adverse effects like significant indoor temperature fluctuations and heightened carbon dioxide levels may arise from certain modifications. Moreover, the findings from the analysis of human comfort assessment methods indicate a lack of focus on human comfort evaluation in carbon emission reduction initiatives, with predominant reliance on subjective questionnaires. Most studies superficially mention human comfort assessment without delving into comprehensive research or employing systematic evaluation techniques. The findings indicate that although the implementation of carbon reduction measures is extensively covered in academic literature, the limited literature addressing human comfort assessment post-implementation implies a need for further comprehensive exploration and development within the field. This study furnishes researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with a comprehensive insight into the current landscape and proposes prospective research avenues within the domain.

The investigation focuses on the influence of physical characteristics, particularly the percent ovality (δ) and the hydraulic diameter to coil diameter ratio ????ℎ???????????????????? on heat transfer efficiency.Empirical results demonstrate that helical coils with high δ values (66.67%) and smaller surface areas exhibit higher heat transfer coefficients and Nusselt numbers. A mathematical model in the form of ????????=0.0327????????0.8595????????0.4 was developed, achieving a correlation coefficient of 99.04%. Furthermore, exergy analysis reveals that the optimized design can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 175.54 kg per year per unit, assuming 8-hour daily operation.These findings can be applied to the development of high-efficiency, environmentally friendly air conditioning systems for buildings and residences, aligning with greenhouse gas emission reduction targets set by the Paris Agreement.

Medical gases were primarily used for respiratory therapy and anesthesia, which showed promising potential in the cancer therapy. Several physiological and pathological processes were affected by the key gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon monoxide. Oxygen targets shrinking the tumor via hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and once combined with radiation therapy it enhances its effect. Nitric oxide has both anti- and pro-tumor effects depending on its level; at high doses, it triggers cell death while at low doses it supports cancer growth. The same concept is applied to hydrogen sulfide which promotes cancer growth by enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics and supporting angiogenesis at low concentrations, while at high concentrations it induces cancer cell death while sparing normal cells. Furthermore, carbon dioxide helps induce apoptosis and improve oxygenation for cancer treatments by increasing the release of oxygen from hemoglobin. Moreover, high-dose carbon monoxide gas therapy has demonstrated significant tumor reductions in vivo and is supported by nanomedicine and specialized medicines to boost its delivery to tumor cells and the availability of hydrogen peroxide. Despite the promising potentials of these gases, several challenges remain. Gas concentrations should be regulated to balance pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects for gases such as nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. Furthermore, effective delivery systems, such as nanoparticles, should be developed for targeted therapy.

Abstract The unavoidable self‐reduction of Bismuth (Bi)‐based catalysts to zero‐valence Bi often results in detrimental adsorption of OCHO * , leading to unsatisfactory selectivity of HCOOH in the electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). A novel Bi‐tannin (Bi‐TA) complex is developed, which undergoes in situ reconstruction into a Bi/Bi₂O₂CO₃ phase during CO 2 reduction. This reconstructed catalyst exhibits high activity and selectivity, achieving a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) for formate production exceeding 90%, peaking at 96%. Operando spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal that the Bi δ+ active site in Bi/Bi₂O₂CO₃ significantly enhances the formation of the OCHO * intermediate, crucial for formate production. The study offers a promising approach to overcoming the limitations of Bi‐based catalysts in CO 2 reduction to formate.

Abstract The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (ERCO 2 ) to chemical feedstock and fuels is a promising strategy for reducing excessive carbon dioxide emissions. There are various benefits of converting CO 2 to a single product and Pb is one of the active and efficienct catalyst for reducing CO 2 to HCOOH. The current work used the electro‐deposition method to produce manganese oxide (Mn 3 O 4 ) (nano particle flakes) and highly active, low‐cost lead (Pb) catalysts with a variety of morphologies (Nano crystal Flakes, Nano wires, and Nano crystal sheets). For the first time, the Mn 3 O 4 catalyst was employed as the anode in the water oxidation process to produce protons, and the electrocatalytic effects of Mn 3 O 4 and Pb on the ERCO 2 reaction were investigated. The influence of CO 2 reduction on catalyst loading is investigated and the lone product HCOOH is detected on the produced Pb catalysts. Using a systematic electrochemical study, the final product of the ERCO 2 reaction is identified and measured. The maximum Faradaic efficiency was measured on Pb (nano crystal flakes) at −1.003 V, yielding efficiency of 77.32 % (10 min) in 1 mg/cm 2 catalyst loading and 78.4 % on nano wires (10 min) at −1.003 V in 2 mg/cm 2 catalyst loading, respectively. More specifically, it is discovered that the reaction selectivity and efficiency of CO 2 electroreduction to HCOOH are highly influenced by the morphology and loading of the catalyst. These results provide an intimate understanding of water oxidation on Mn 3 O 4 and CO 2 electroreduction on Pb catalyst.

Carbon emissions accelerate global warming and climate change, prompting the global development of strategies for carbon reduction. Wood, with its excellent carbon storage capacity, is a sustainable and environmentally friendly material. One cubic meter of timber can absorb 1 t of carbon dioxide and store 250 kg of carbon. This study aimed to conduct fire resistance tests on structural glue-laminated timber beams made from Korean larch (Larix kaempferi) and analyze their char properties. The specimens were fabricated with different cross-sectional shapes and areas and underwent load-bearing fire resistance tests. The results were analyzed in terms of char depth, char rate, and changes in char thickness based on the aspect ratio of the beams. In the smaller specimens, the char properties were influenced more by the width than by the length of the beam. Additionally, at a constant cross-sectional area, charring was deeper when the width was shorter than the height. The specimens did not exhibit significant differences in displacement behavior, with all specimens displaying displacements below the maximum permissible value, indicating suitable fire resistance.

ABSTRACT: A study has been conducted on CO2 interaction degradation effects on the mechanical properties of reservoir formations for two carbon capture and storage projects in offshore Peninsular Malaysia. This study focuses on two new potential CO2 fields storage (B-field and J-field), with each presenting higher porosities compared to other CO2 degradation studies reported in the region. In this study, difficulties arose when testing the high porosity sandstone samples using multi-stage triaxial testing method. These high porosity samples tend to fail prematurely before achieving at least 3 confining cycles, particularly the post-CO2 ageing samples. Subsequent adjustments were made to the unloading criteria, which were controlled based on the volumetric strain over axial strain ratio, to prevent any further premature failure to the subsequent samples. From the results of the B-field and J-field pre- and post-CO2 ageing multi-stage triaxial tests, a reduction varying from 4.4-23.9% were observed for unconfined compressive strength, whilst for friction angle and cohesion, a reduction of 8.5-25.9% and 13.4-20.5% were generally observed. On the other hand, for Young's modulus of the samples, the results showed a reduction ranging from 5.7-42.9% whereas Poisson's ratio has changes ranging between reduction of 7.5-21.4% to an increase of 5.6%. This study emphasises the considerable degradation of rock mechanical properties observed in sandstones due to their interaction with CO2. It reveals that exposure to CO2 can significantly alter the structural integrity of these rocks, leading to a decrease in strength and stiffness. This degradation is critical to understand, as it directly impacts the viability of potential CO2 storage sites. In addition, it reveals the property degradation necessitates careful adjustments to the unloading criteria when conducting multi-stage triaxial testing on high porosity samples that have undergone CO2 ageing as they are susceptible to premature failure, largely due to their amplified friability. This underscores the importance of adapting testing protocols to account for the degraded mechanical properties of these materials, ensuring more reliable assessments of their performance in CO2 storage applications.

<p>Thawing permafrost releases methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, contributing to positive feedback loop in global warming. Therefore, accurately monitoring changes in the permafrost freeze–thaw status is imperative. However, the spatiotemporal evolution and potential driving factors remain elusive. Here, we investigated the freeze–thaw status and driving factors by developing novel machine learning models trained on satellite and in situ observations in the Northern Hemisphere. We find that the frozen duration decreased on average by 0.17 days/yr since 1990 with the highest decrease of approximately up to 1.0 days/yr in parts of Belarus and Ukraine, followed by the Yukon region in Canada and Alaska. This decrease is primarily driven by temperatures in boreal autumn and spring and by precipitation and vegetation cover in boreal spring. The frozen duration is projected to decline further with reduction rates doubling until 2050 for the highest and moderate emission scenarios.</p>

Arctic ecosystems are affected by accelerated warming as well as the intensification of the hydrologic cycle, yet understanding of the impacts of compound climate extremes (e.g., simultaneous extreme heat and rainfall) remains limited, despite their high potential to alter ecosystems. Here, we show that the aquatic ecosystems in historically arid west Greenland have undergone an ecological transformation after a series of atmospheric rivers that simultaneously produced record heat and rainfall hit the region in autumn 2022. We analyzed a unique, long-term lake dataset and found that compound climate extremes pushed Arctic lakes across a tipping point. As terrestrial–aquatic linkages were strengthened, lakes synchronously transformed from “blue” lakes with high transparency and low pelagic primary production to “brown” in less than a year, owing to a large influx of dissolved organic material and metals, with iron concentrations increasing by more than two orders of magnitude. The browning of lake waters reduced light penetration by 50% across lakes. The resulting light limitation altered plankton distributions and community structure, including a major reduction in prokaryotic diversity and an increase in algal groups capable of metabolizing organic carbon sources. As a result, lakes shifted from being summer carbon sinks to sources, with a >350% increase in carbon dioxide flux from lakes to the atmosphere. The remarkably rapid, coherent transformation of these Arctic ecosystems underscores the synergistic and unpredictable impacts of compound extreme events and the importance of their seasonal timing, especially in regions with negative moisture balance.

The present study details the synthesis and characterization of a robust, monomeric Al-H aluminate supported by a tridentate tris-phenolate ligand, isolated as [2][Li(THF)4] and [2][N(nBu)4] salts, which were then exploited as CO2 hydroboration catalysts. As initial reactivity studies, it was observed that the nucleophilic Al-H anion in [2][C] (C = countercation [Li(THF)4]+ or [N(nBu)4]+) reacts fast with CO2, to afford the corresponding Al-formate complexes [3][C], which were isolated and structurally characterized. Such anions were then exploited as potential CO2 reduction catalysts. Salts [2-3][N(nBu)4] are efficient and robust CO2 hydroboration catalysts in the presence of pinBH or Me2S-BH3 as hydroborane sources to selectively afford formate-equivalent or methanol-equivalent products (TON up 1920), depending on reaction conditions and the nature of the countercation. As deduced from detailed DFT calculations, the Al-formate anion [3]- acts as a nucleophilic catalyst (for borane activation) but also as an electrophile (through the AlOCO carbon) allowing CO2 activation/functionalization and thus the reduction catalysis to occur, a process thermodynamically driven by the stability of the reduction products. The anionic nature of [2]- and [3]- aluminates, resulting in an enhanced nucleophilicity (vs neutral analogues), may thus be crucial for catalytic activity. In contrast, according to DFT calculations performed with a model anion of [3]- and pinBH, a CO2 reduction processing via an Al-O/B-H σ-bond metathesis appears to be kinetically unfavored. The proposed mechanism involving an electrophilic/nucleophilic dual-activation mode also rationalizes the importance of countercation [C]+ in [2-3][C] for catalytic activity and selectivity, as demonstrated by the higher performance of [2][N(nBu)4] vs [2][Li(THF)4].

Abstract Background We aimed to analyze the yet unclear correlation between air pollutant concentrations (AP) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Shenzhen, China. Methods A 5-year time series analysis of all OHCA events reported to the Shenzhen Emergency Center was conducted. Quasi-Poisson regression, controlling for meteorological variables (daily mean relative temperature and humidity) with multivariable fractional polynomial and using Fourier series to adjust for long-term trends and account for periodic patterns, was used to assess the association among particulate matter of 2.5 μm (PM2.5), ozone (O3), particulate matter of ≥10 μm (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and OHCA. Results Data from 16,769 patients who experienced OHCA were analyzed. An increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with a higher risk of OHCA (relative risk (RR): 1.026 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.001–1.053]) on lag day 1. A similar increase in PM10 was linked to an immediate risk of OHCA on the onset day (RR: 1.02 [95% CI: 1.005–1.036]) and a cumulative risk on lag day 1 (RR: 1.021 [95% CI: 1.003–1.039]). An increased risk of OHCA was associated with NO2 and O3 exposure, while a reduced risk of OHCA was associated with SO2 and CO exposure in the subsequent 5 days. The relationship between PM2.5 and OHCA varied by gender and arrest rhythm. A reduction in the average daily PM2.5 concentration by 1 µg/m³ could decrease the incidence of OHCA attributable to PM2.5 exposure by 4.60%, while a reduction by 3 µg/m³ could decrease it by 18.41% on lag day 1. PM2.5 was significantly associated with the occurrence of OHCA on lag day 1. This association was modulated by gender and arrest rhythm. Conclusion Improving the levels of PM2.5, NO2, and O3 could decrease the risk of OHCA and the demand for emergency medical service related to PM2.5 exposure.

ABSTRACT: A comprehensive CO2 storage development plan study was conducted on Field X in offshore East Malaysia. The study is aimed at addressing, among others, the numerous geomechanical challenges and risks associated with the CO2 injection and geological storage, injectivity and storage capacity. The key geomechanical challenges include maintaining the seal integrity throughout the injection operation and storage life and the impact of thermal cooling by the injected CO2 on hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in the reservoir and caprock. Furthermore, due to the high porosity carbonate reservoir underwent pore collapse during production, the reduction in injectivity and storage capacity is required to be delineated. Two-way coupled geomechanics-dynamic-thermal modelling workflow with rock properties degradation due to CO2-rock interaction and simultaneous history match for reservoir simulation and geomechanical subsidence modelling was implemented. Recognising the pore collapse behaviour of the reservoir, Modified Cam Clay model was implemented in the geomechanical modelling. The rock properties degradations were based on triaxial tests conducted on untreated samples and samples dynamically aged with CO2 saturated brine, and the properties degradations ranged between 8 and 30%. Based on the evolution of total minimum horizontal stress during injection, caprock injection pressure limit is determined which corresponds to final caprock injection pressure limit of 3890 psi. The subsidence predicted in the model before CO2 injection shows good match with GPS measurement data over a period of 16 years. The mechanical properties degradation effects on fault stability, caprock integrity, expansion and uplift due to CO2-rock interaction are minimal. The proposed CO2 injection scenario showed low risk of shear and tensile failures in caprock, and all the faults remained stable. Based on the coupled thermal geomechanical simulation, the temperature cooling is localised at the injectors within 2200 ft lateral distance from the injectors. The cooling resulted in temperature drop by up to 103 °C in the reservoir and 30 °C in the caprock. The cooling resulted in fracture gradient reduction of up to 1400 psi in the reservoir and up to 700 psi in the caprock. The hydraulic fractures initiated will propagate in the reservoir but not in the caprock. The output from the coupled geomechanical modelling was subsequently used to develop recommendations from geomechanical perspective for the CO2 injection and storage operation in order to mature the field as a CO2 storage site, including the CO2 injection pressure and its respective storage capacity together with measurement, monitoring and validation programme using seabed and downhole monitoring as well as surface seismic methods and micro-seismic techniques.

Many industries use synthetic rubber for various industrial purposes; thus, disposal of synthetic waste rubber into the environment causes huge environmental problems. A feasibility study to convert synthetic Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) waste into valuable products using batch-type slow pyrolysis will benefit small- to medium-scale industries in their waste handling. The main objective of this research was to find sustainable waste management and energy solutions for synthetic NBR waste using pyrolysis technology. This study employed a two-phase experimental approach where the first five preliminary experiments were conducted to assess the thermal decomposition behavior of NBR waste. In the second phase, three experiments were conducted to quantify the yields of pyrolysis products: pyrolysis oil, solid char, and syngas. The results reveal that the weight distribution of pyrolysis oil, solid char, and syngas was 39.00%, 42.91%, and 18.09%, respectively. Moreover, density, heating value, flash point, and viscosity were analyzed to investigate the quality of the pyrolysis oil, where it was found to be 972.50 kg/m3, 42.50 MJ/kg, 36.50 °C, and 25.44 cP, respectively. Analysis of the syngas composition revealed that carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, oxygen, and CnHm were 14.14%, 5.04%, 18.69%, 11.08%, 0.02%, and 10.00%, respectively. The heating value of syngas was 3873.70 Kcal/m3. The carbon footprint analysis indicated that a significant reduction is possible in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional incineration. Additionally, a cost benefit analysis highlighted the superior cost effectiveness of pyrolysis over incineration of NBR waste. These findings underscore the potential of pyrolysis as an effective tool for sustainable waste management and energy recovery solutions.

This work deals with the design of nanocomposite hydrogenation‐dehydration bifunctional catalysts for the one‐pot conversion of CO2 to dimethyl ether (DME), focusing on obtaining a high and homogeneous dispersion of a Cu‐based CO2 hydrogenation phase into the pores of mesostructured supports. Particularly, three aluminosilicate mesostructured acid catalysts with catalytic activity towards methanol dehydration and featuring different porous structures (Al‐MCM‐41, Al‐SBA‐15, Al‐SBA‐16) were synthesized and used as supports to host a CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 (CZZ) CO2 hydrogenation catalyst for methanol synthesis. The use of a mesostructured support allows to maximize the exposed surface of the CO2 reduction function by nanostructuring it through its confinement within the mesochannels, thus obtaining nanocomposite bifunctional catalysts with an ultra‐small hydrogenation nanophase. The nanocomposites were obtained using an impregnation strategy combined with a self‐combustion reaction, allowing to incorporate the CO2 reduction phase inside the mesopores. In all cases, the characterization shows that the hydrogenation phase species are highly and homogeneously dispersed into the supports as either small nanoparticles or as a nanolayer. The as‐obtained nanocomposites were tested for their catalytic activity and the results discussed taking into account the structural, textural, and acidic properties of the supports and nanocomposites.

The comprehensive understanding of the effect of the chemical environment surrounding active sites on the pathway for the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is essential for the development of advanced catalysts for large-scale applications. Based on a series of model catalysts engineered by the coordination of copper ions with various isomers of phenylenediamine [i.e., o-phenylenediamine (oPD), m-phenylenediamine (mPD), and p-phenylenediamine (pPD)] featuring two amino groups in ortho-, meta-, and para-positions, the steric effects could significantly govern the selectivity of the "Cu–N" sites for eCO2RR. It was found the steric distance between adjacent copper and nitrogen active sites in Cu-oPD enhanced the C–C coupling of the *COOH intermediate, thereby resulting in increased selectivity for C2H4 production. In contrast, the weak van der Waals interactions arising from steric electrostatic effects surrounding the *CHO intermediate on Cu-pPD facilitated subsequent hydrogenation, leading to the preferential synthesis of CH4. However, Cu-mPD exhibited diminished eCO2RR activity due to a higher free energy associated with the rate-determining step, which primarily led to the formation of H2. This study underscores the significant role of a steric effect-driven selectivity switch for eCO2RR.

Economic growth and CO2 emissions are closely linked to energy consumption. Energy transition towards renewable energy sources (RES) and improving energy efficiency are crucial to combating global warming. EU member states are striving to reduce CO2 emissions while supporting economic growth. However, it is necessary to develop an understanding of how both gross domestic product (GDP) level and RES share affect energy efficiency and CO2 emissions. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of the GDP level and the renewable energy sources (RES) share on CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and economic growth in European Union states. The study employs structural equation modelling (SEM) using the partial least squares (PLS) method. The analysis is based on data collected from Eurostat, the OECD and other sources covering the period 2004-2023.The paper constitutes a substantial contribution to the body of literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of GDP level and the share of renewable energy sources (RES) on CO2 emissions, taking into account energy efficiency and urbanisation as key factors. The study revealed that a high level of GDP combined with a high share of RES in the energy mix is conducive to a more effective reduction of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, urbanisation has a varying impact on economic growth depending on the level of GDP and the share of RES. This points to the need to take the state’s specifics into account when developing energy policies. The findings may provide policymakers with some guidelines when shaping energy and environmental strategies in EU states.

Efficient CO2 capture at concentrations between 400‐2000 ppm is essential for maintaining air quality in a habitable environment and advancing carbon capture technologies. This study introduces NICS‐24 (National Institute of Chemistry Structures No. 24), a Zn‐oxalate 3,5‐diamino‐1,2,4‐triazolate framework with two distinct square‐shaped channels, designed to enhance CO2 capture at indoor‐relevant concentrations. NICS‐24 exhibits a CO2 uptake of 0.7 mmol/g at 2 mbar and 25 °C, significantly outperforming the compositionally related Zn‐oxalate 1,2,4‐triazolate ‐ CALF‐20 (0.17 mmol/g). Improved performance is attributed to amino‐functions that enhance CO2 binding and enable superior selectivity over N2 and O2, achieving 8‐fold and 30‐fold improvements, respectively, in simulated CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 atmospheric ratios. In humid environments, NICS‐24 retained structural integrity but exhibited an 85 % reduction in CO2 capacity due to competitive water adsorption. Breakthrough sorption experiments, atomistic NMR analysis, and DFT calculations revealed that water preferentially adsorbs over CO2 due to strong hydrogen‐bonding interactions within the framework. Gained understanding of the interaction between CO2 and H2O within the MOF framework could guide the modification via rational design with improved performance under real‐world conditions.

NICS‐24 exhibits a CO2 uptake of 0.7 mmol/g at 2 mbar and 25 °C, significantly outperforming the compositionally related Zn‐oxalate 1,2,4‐triazolate ‐ CALF‐20 (0.17 mmol/g). Improved performance is attributed to amino‐functions that enhance CO2 binding and enable superior selectivity over N2 and O2, achieving 8‐fold and 30‐fold improvements, respectively, in simulated CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 atmospheric ratios. In humid environments, NICS‐24 retained structural integrity but exhibited an 85 % reduction in CO2 capacity due to competitive water adsorption. Breakthrough sorption experiments, atomistic NMR analysis, and DFT calculations revealed that water preferentially adsorbs over CO2 due to strong hydrogen‐bonding interactions within the framework. Gained understanding of the interaction between CO2 and H2O within the MOF framework could guide the modification via rational design with improved performance under real‐world conditions.

Abstract In this work, a comprehensive numerical simulation is conducted to investigate the heat transfer enhancement (HTE) and heat transfer deterioration (HTD) for supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) near the critical point in horizontal and inclined mini tubes. First, the model’s results were validated against available experimental data in the literature with good agreement. Notably, the simulations successfully capture the phenomenon of HTD at elevated heat flux to mass flux ratios. Furthermore, to highlight the advantages of utilizing sCO2, a comparative analysis with water under identical conditions is conducted. It was found that sCO2 demonstrates distinct advantages, particularly near the pseudocritical point at low heat flux to mass flux ratios. Then, the effect of different operational and geometrical parameters of circular tubes on heat transfer performance is considered. The operational parameters include mass flux, heat flux, inlet temperature, and inlet pressure. The geometrical parameters are considered to mitigate the HTD and include tube diameter, and tube inclination angle. The effects of geometrical parameters on buoyancy flow under a wide range of heat and mass fluxes are explored. The results demonstrate that the maximum heat transfer coefficient decreases significantly with the deviation of the operating pressure from the critical pressure HTE case. Additionally, the thermal performance improves significantly with the tube diameter reduction, while inclination angle has a minimal effect except for upward flow in HTD case. Finally, the results unveil that miniaturization weakens buoyancy effect.

CO2 conversion to CH3OH under mild conditions is of particular interest yet rather challenging. Both electro- and thermo-catalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH can only produce CH3OH in low concentration (typically mixed with water), requiring energy-intensive purification processes. Here we design a sun-simulated-driven tandem catalytic system comprising CO2 electroreduction to syngas, and further photothermal conversion into high-purity CH3OH (volume fraction > 97%). We construct a self-supporting electrocatalyst featuring dual active sites of Ni single atoms and encapsulated Co nanoparticles, which could produce syngas with a constant H2:CO ratio of ~2 via solar-powered CO2 electroreduction. The generated syngas is subsequently fed into the photothermal module, which could produce high-purity CH3OH under 1 sun-light irradiation, with a rate of 0.238 gCH3OH gcat–1 h–1. This work demonstrates a feasible and sustainable route for directly converting CO2 into high-purity CH3OH. CO2 conversion to CH3OH under mild conditions is of particular interest yet rather challenging. Here, the authors report a sun-simulated-driven tandem catalytic system comprising CO2 electroreduction to syngas, and further photothermal conversion into high-purity CH3OH (volume fraction <97%).

Converting CO2 and green hydrogen into products such as methane and methanol not only has a negative carbon effect, but also stores renewable energy into energy chemicals. This represents a promising route for hydrogen energy storage technologies. The hydrogenation of CO2 to methane and methanol, which represent strongly exothermic reactions, are thermodynamically favored at low temperatures. However, the inherent inertness of CO2 makes it difficult to activate CO2 at low temperatures. Both reactions face the challenge of activating CO2 at low temperature, so catalysts exhibiting high activity under such conditions are a critical need. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted considerable interest owing to their regular layered structure and uniform dispersion of multiple metallic components. However, there are few studies on the same effects of promoters over LDHs-derived catalysts. Here, we investigated the same effects of promoters on two LDHs-derived catalysts in different CO2 hydrogenation reactions to illustrate the effects of promoters on facilitating low-temperature CO2 activation in LDHs-derived catalysts. By adding promoters Fe and Mn to the catalysts NiAl-Fe and CuZnAl-Mn, the crystal lattices were expanded, surface areas were increased 38% and 25%, and the reduction temperatures were decreased to 97 °C and 10 °C, respectively. These promoters significantly enhanced the CO2 adsorption and activation of the catalysts NiAl-Fe and CuZnAl-Mn. The methanation catalyst NiAl-Fe achieved a CO2 conversion of 80.8% at 200 °C and 2 MPa, while the methanol synthesis catalyst CuZnAl-Mn exhibited a CO2 conversion of 21.3% and a methanol selectivity of 61.8% under the conditions of 250 °C and 3 MPa. The influence of the LDHs precursors’ structure and the addition of promoters Fe and Mn on the catalytic performance were studied by XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption, H2-TPR, H2-TPD, and CO2-TPD.

Background The CO2 emissions reduction is crucial for the energy transition. Thus, new technologies for CO2 capture and storage are under development, such as CEEGS 1,2 . Porous media and rock caverns are geological formations of high interest for such technology. Among them, depleted hydrocarbon fields (DHF) gain ground due to the experience of reservoir characterisation, sealing performance, storage operability, and already established infrastructure which critically decreases the cost. However, one of the major problems caused during CO2 storage in DHF is the interactions between the injected CO2 and the remaining fluids. Methods In this study, the potential CO2 storage in DHF was investigated. Marismas 3 was used as a hypothetical model area for the examination of CO2 interactions with a carbonate-silisiclastic reservoir. PHREEQC software 1  was used to investigate reservoir rock/water/remained gas (CH4) interactions followed by interactions taking place after the CO2 injection. Different scenarios were used for the CO2 concentration and behaviour in the reservoir. To make the system more complex and generic, the CMG-GEM software 3  was utilized to examine the long-term sequestration of CO2 through dissolution trapping, residual trapping, and lateral migration in a reservoir analogue to the Marismas field, but at higher depth, compatible with the CEEGS technology. Results During the CO2 injection, carbonic acid was formed, causing a dissolution of several minerals, leading to siderite and clay minerals precipitation (e.g. kaolinite, Ca-montmorillonite, and illite), which may cause problems to the permeability of the system. The colloidal nature of siderite and the Ca-montmorillonite swelling properties are of high concern for pore throat clogging. However, the other newly formed mineralogical phases are not threatening the reservoir quality. CMG-GEM validated the critical phase of CO2 plume establishment. Conclusions The proposed DHF is promising for real-world underground applications fitting to CEEGS technology.

Bio-CNG has emerged as a potential replacement for conventional fossil fuels used in road vehicles, a major source of global air pollution. This research aimed to perform comparative performance and emission analysis under various conditions to observe its viability. A Bajaj, 175 CC powered gasoline, 4-stroke, and carbureted engine was chosen and converted to the bi-fuel system that operates either with gasoline or bio-CNG using an electronically controlled solenoid valve. The engine power and traction forces were measured under the road's 0o, 4o, and 8o inclination at no load and 5kW load coefficients. Vehicle exhaust emission levels (CO, CO2, HC, and lambda) were measured at the idle rpm of the engine (1240 RPM for petrol and 1022 RPM for bio-CNG). The experimental data from the chassis dynamometer revealed significant reductions in power and traction force under various conditions. Furthermore, emissions analysis from exhaust gas analyzer showed remarkable reductions of 98% for CO and 89% for HC, but there was a 16.67% increase in CO2 levels. This research provides insights into the potential benefits and challenges of bio-CNG conversion for small-engine vehicles and suggests possible measures to improve the performance of converted vehicles.

This study systematically performs multi-scale numerical investigation of supercritical CO2-energized fracturing, widely employed for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in tight oil and gas reservoirs. Two distinct models, spanning from core scale to field scale, are designed to explore the diffusion patterns of CO2 into the matrix and its impact on crude oil production at varying scales. The core-scale model employs discrete grid regions to simulate the interaction between fractures and the core, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of CO2 diffusion and its interaction with crude oil. Based on the core-scale numerical model, the wellbore treatment process is simulated, investigating CO2 distribution within the core and its influence on crude oil during the well treatment phase. The field-scale model employs a series of grids to simulate fractures, the matrix, and the treatment zone. Additionally, a dilation model is employed to simulate fracture initiation and closure during CO2 fracturing and production processes. The model explores CO2 diffusion and its interaction with crude oil at different shut-in times and various injection rates, analyzing their impact on cumulative oil production within a year. The study concludes that during shut-in, CO2 continues to diffuse deeper into the matrix until CO2 concentration reaches an equilibrium within a certain range. At the core scale, CO2 penetrates approximately 4 cm into the core after a 15-day shut-in, effectively reducing the viscosity within a range of about 3.5 cm. At the field scale, CO2 diffusion extends up to approximately 4 m, with an effective viscosity reduction zone of about 3 m. Results suggest that, theoretically, higher injection rates and longer shut-in times yield better EOR results. However, considering economic factors, a 20-day shut-in period is preferred. Different injection rates indicate varying fracture conduction capabilities upon gas injection completion.

Purpose – The paper is primarily aimed to assess the impact of selected macro economic conditions and the financial situation of decarbonization of the logistics sector in Poland from 2008 to 2020.Research method – To verify the main research hypothesis, the author creates a syn-thetic indicator of decarbonization, of macroeconomic conditions and of the sector’s financial situation, using one of the normalization methods. To estimate the impact of explanatory variables on the dependent variable, the author used the Ordinary Least Square Method (OLS).Results – The research results show a positive trend in the decarbonization indicator of the logistics sector, which is particularly visible at the end of the period under study, i.e. in 2019–2020. EU regulations undoubtedly influence this state of affairs regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. The estimation results indicate that macroeconomic conditions and the sector’s financial situation from the previous period (t-1) statistically significantly impact (p < 0.05) the decarbonization of logistics. It should be noted that the directions of their influence are different. Macro economic conditions from the period (t-1) positively impact decarbonization, and the financial situation has a negative impact.Originality / value / implications / recommendations – The paper’s novelty is expressed in presenting a model estimating the impact of macroeconomic and financial conditions on the decarbonization of logistics. The decarbonization process was also presented, and the literature in the examined area was reviewed. The study results indicate that economic and financial factors are important for decarbonization. Hence, their improvement should positively impact the ecological investments of enterprises in the logistics sector.

Abstract Background We aimed to compare real-life direct and indirect costs and the environmental impact of switching IBD patients from IV to SC infliximab (IFX). Methods Adult IBD outpatients in clinical remission who switched from IV to SC IFX were studied. Data on direct and indirect costs for the hospital (€), and environmental impact (Carbon dioxide equivalents [CO2e]), were evaluated before and after switching. Patients also completed an anonymous pilot questionnaire designed to assess the indirect costs associated with their own drug administration. A consecutive sample of patients was used to calculate costs over 6 months of both therapy regimens. Results Twelve patients switched to SC IFX (91.7% were under-optimised IV dosage). Before switching, most missed work (58.3%) or changed shifts for infusions (25%), leading to a median of 4 missed workdays over 6 months, translating to an estimated median loss of 328€ in self-earnings. Patients spent a median of 92.5 min travelling to and 720 min at the hospital. Post-switch, hospital time decreased to 195 min (p=0.005). However, due to pharmacy stock rules requiring frequent hospital visits to collect SC therapy, both travel time (190 min; p=0.009) and travel frequency (4.0 vs 6.0 visits; p=0.004) increased. Estimated travel costs for patients rose from 89.6€ to 196.0€ over 6 months (p=0.007). Median direct costs were 1321.34€ for IV IFX and 2604€ for SC IFX (p=0.008), while indirect costs dropped as preparation time fell from 140 min for IV to 70 min for SC (p=0.001), corresponding to an estimated cost reduction of 9.59€ (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, nursing staff time significantly reduced from 600 min with IV to 40 min with SC (p=0.002), corresponding to 95.01€ reduction (p&lt;0.001), respectively. Over 6 months, IV IFX had a median carbon footprint of 20.95 kg CO2eq (11.6 kg from infusions; 9.35 kg from patient travel), while SC IFX generated 24.15 kg CO2e (3.6 kg from injections; 20.55 kg from patient travel) per patient (p=0.859). Conclusion Our analysis shows SC IFX incurs higher direct costs than IV IFX without reducing the carbon footprint. However, reduced indirect patient costs and improved pharmacy and day hospital efficiency may offset these expenses. To maximise benefits, pharmacies should adjust stock management policies and minimise patient travel. These factors should be evaluated locally in a switching program design.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impacts of institutional pressures and individual adaptation performance on the adoption of green supply chain practices and reverse logistics, and their effects on production-based CO2 emissions, focusing on emerging markets with a detailed case study of Türkiye. Methodology: The research methodology employed structural equation modeling (SEM) and SmartPLS for the analysis of the data. This approach allowed for an in-depth examination of the relationships between institutional pressures, individual adaptive performance, green supply chain practices, reverse logistics, and CO2 emissions. Findings: The findings reveal a nuanced relationship where institutional pressures directly impact reverse logistics but show minimal direct influence on green supply chain practices or CO2 emissions reduction. In contrast, individual adaptive performance is crucial in enhancing both green supply chain practices and reverse logistics. Notably, reverse logistics is significantly effective in reducing CO2 emissions. Originality: This study enriches the literature by revealing how institutional pressures and individual adaptive performance influence green supply chain management in emerging markets, particularly demonstrating through the case of Türkiye that the impact of within-field variability on the adoption of superior practices depends on individual adaptive performance.

ABSTRACT: The integration of advanced computational techniques with traditional reservoir engineering practices has revolutionized the field of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), particularly in the context of carbon sequestration. This study integrates machine learning (ML) algorithms and 3D visualization techniques to optimize CO2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) in the depleted Balkasar Oil Field, located in Pakistan's Potwar Basin. The application of ML, including neural networks and decision trees, allowed for the detailed analysis of extensive datasets comprising well logs, seismic surveys, and petrophysical measurements. The algorithms uncovered complex relationships between key reservoir properties, such as porosity, permeability, and hydrocarbon saturation, enabling precise predictions of hydrocarbon-bearing zones and dynamic fluid behaviors. A 3D geomechanical grid was constructed to visualize subsurface heterogeneities, including fault zones and fluid distribution, aiding in the identification of optimal CO2 injection zones. Simulations conducted on this grid revealed a recovery efficiency enhancement exceeding 30%, confirming the potential for significant hydrocarbon recovery. Moreover, pressure monitoring and CO2 plume migration predictions validated the integrity of sequestration, with stable storage observed under varying injection scenarios. The study's findings underscore the transformative potential of integrating advanced computational tools with traditional reservoir engineering methods. For instance, dynamic modeling in the Chorgali and Sakesar formations identified zones with high hydrocarbon retention, ensuring strategic injection planning. The multivariate fitting method demonstrated robust predictions of organic carbon content, essential for assessing the reservoir's remaining hydrocarbon potential. 1. INTRODUCTION The transition toward sustainable energy practices necessitates innovative strategies that simultaneously address the imperatives of carbon reduction and efficient hydrocarbon recovery. The global energy sector is facing increasing pressure to mitigate climate change while meeting growing energy demands (Earlougher, 1977). This process involves injecting CO2 into depleted oil fields, where it reduces oil viscosity, improving its flow to production wells (Bourdet, 2002). ML models, such as neural networks and decision trees, can uncover hidden patterns in the data, improving the accuracy of reservoir predictions and optimizing CO2-EOR strategies (Manrique et al., 2007).

Abstract Hypertrophic scars (HTSs) are the result of an abnormal healing process resulting from burns and other severe traumas. The symptoms of that condition include skin irritation, discomfort, and itching. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of fractional carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) laser therapy alone or with triamcinolone or 5-fluorouracil (FU) in the treatment of early post-burn hypertrophic scars (HTSs) that develop during the first 6 months after the injury. A prospective, randomized, single-blind comparative study was conducted on 30 patients aged 16–65 with hypertrophic scars (HTS) resulting from burns. Patients had no prior treatment for their scars. We randomly assigned participants to one of three groups: Group A received fractional CO 2 laser therapy alone, Group B received fractional CO 2 laser therapy with topical 5-fluorouracil, and Group C received fractional CO 2 laser therapy with topical triamcinolone acetonide. All treatment groups showed significant improvements ( p < 0.05) in overall scar severity and height. Patients in Group C (fractional CO 2 laser + triamcinolone) demonstrated significant improvements in scar pliability, height, and pigmentation ( p < 0.05). In contrast, patients in Group B (fractional CO 2 laser + 5-FU) showed significant reductions in scar vascularity, pliability, and height following treatment ( p < 0.05). While all groups reported minor changes in pain and itching, there were no significant differences in these symptoms between Group B and Group C. HTSs of this trial revealed reductions in overall scar surface area and thickness and improvement of pliability and pigmentation; however, there was not statistically significant difference between the effect of 5-fluorouracil and triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), suggesting that neither drug offers better efficacy over the other.

One of the important problems of sustainable logistics is routing vehicles in a sustainable manner, the green vehicle routing problem, or vehicle routing problems which aim to reduce CO2 emissions. In the literature research, it was seen that these problems were solved with heuristic, metaheuristic, or hyper-heuristic methods and hybrid approaches since they are in the NP-hard class. This work presents a parallel multi-process genetic algorithm that incorporates problem-specific genetic operators to minimize CO2 emissions in the capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem. Unlike previous research, the algorithm combines parallel computing with tailored genetic operators in order to enhance the diversity of solutions and speed up convergence. Genetic algorithm models were developed to minimize total distance, CO2 emissions, and both objectives simultaneously. Two genetic algorithm models were developed to minimize total distance and CO2 emissions. Experimental results using the reference CVRP examples such as A-n32-k5 and B-n44-k7 show that the proposed approach reduces CO2 emissions by 1.2% more than hybrid artificial bee colony optimization, 1.3% more than ant colony optimization, and 4% more than the traditional genetic algorithm. Experimental results using benchmark CVRP instances demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms hybrid artificial bee colony optimization, ant colony optimization, and traditional genetic algorithms for most of the test cases. This is done by exploiting multi-core processors, and the parallel architecture has improved computational efficiency; the modules compare and update solutions against the global optimum. Results obtained show that prioritizing CO2 emissions as the only objective yields better results compared to multi-objective models. This study makes two significant contributions to the literature: (1) it introduces a novel parallel genetic algorithm framework optimized for CO2 emission reduction, and (2) it provides empirical evidence underscoring the advantages of emission-focused optimization in CVRP.

Currently, the issue of education for the development of a ‘green’ economy is among the most pressing global challenges. In this context, this study explores the relationship between CO2 emissions and education levels, represented by government spending on education as a share of GDP, alongside economic and social indicators such as GDP per capita, urbanization ratio, and inflation rate. The analysis focuses on the cases of Kazakhstan and Turkey. The study used a forecasting methodology involving a regression model to determine the relationships between changes in CO2 emissions, educational attainment, and economic and social parameters. A multiple linear regression model was constructed to assess education’s impact, and the ecological footprint and ecological deficit for the two countries studied were determined. The study uses information from the Footprint Data Foundation (Footprint Data Foundation). The research complements the existing theoretical framework on sustainable development, offering an interdisciplinary approach combining economic, environmental and educational aspects. The results show that education and GDP per capita significantly positively impact reducing CO2 emissions in Kazakhstan. The results can be used to justify the need to integrate environmental knowledge into educational programs and to develop more comprehensive models of the interaction of factors affecting the reduction of the carbon footprint. From a practical point of view, the study’s results will provide empirical data and analysis that can be useful for developing educational and economic strategies and more effective government programs aimed at reducing CO2 emissions, improving environmental quality and promoting green growth.

Abstract Microcellular foams made from poly (butylene adipate‐co‐terephthalate) (PBAT) using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 ) as a physical foaming agent have exhibited high shrinkage and low expansion ratios, limiting their potential applications. Previous studies have indicated that while PBAT exhibits foaming capabilities, its maximum expansion ratio typically does not exceed 20, and it is characterized by a high shrinkage ratio, which limits its application in high‐performance foams. In contrast, this study presented an 80PBAT/20PPC microcellular foam that has achieved a stable expansion ratio of 38.9 and a substantial reduction in shrinkage ratio to 9.4% from the 89.5% observed in pure PBAT. This advancement is attributed to the blending of PBAT with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC), a polymer with moderate compatibility. PPC was uniformly dispersed within the PBAT matrix in micro/nano particle form, which inhibited crystallization and leveraged its unique molecular structure to enhance CO 2 solubility, thereby increasing the expansion ratio and refining the cell structure. Additionally, PPC particles acted as stress concentrators, promoting cell wall rupture and forming an open‐cell structure. Furthermore, the higher glass transition temperature ( T g ) of PPC further enhanced the stiffness of the cell walls. These synergistic effects enabled PBAT/PPC microcellular foams to effectively resist shrinkage caused by internal–external pressure differentials. Highlights Blending with PPC increased the expansion ratio of PBAT foams to 38.9. Shrinkage of 80PBAT/20PPC foams is drastically reduced to 9.4%. PPC in PBAT matrix enhanced CO₂ solubility and inhibited crystallization. PPC particles acted as stress concentrators, facilitating open‐cell structure.

Gas foam injection offers a viable solution to challenges faced in oil reservoirs, yet ensuring optimal foamability and stability remains a pivotal hurdle in practical field operations. This study presents a novel synthesis procedure to create silica (SiO2) Janus nanoparticles (JNPs) and examines their potential to enhance gas foam stability for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications. Two variations of SiO2 JNPs were synthesized via a masking procedure, employing oleic acid and ascorbic acid within a Pickering emulsion, marking a pioneering approach. These nanoparticles underwent comprehensive analysis for a deeper understanding. The investigation sought to unravel the mechanisms behind these JNPs' performance in the foam injection process, probing various operational parameters such as JNP type, concentration, and gas medium (air, CO2, and CH4) impact on surface tension reduction, foamability, and stability through static tests. Results uncovered remarkable efficiency in SiO2-oleic acid JNPs, showcasing a substantial edge in reducing surface tension compared to bare SiO2 nanoparticles. Specifically, at a concentration of 15,000 ppm, SiO2-oleic acid JNPs demonstrated a 25 mN/m greater reduction in surface tension than bare SiO2 within a CH4 medium. Notably, while the gas type had limited influence on surface tension under standard pressure, the synthesized JNPs showed superior foam stabilization in air compared to CO2 and CH4 environments. SiO2-oleic JNPs exhibited outstanding foamability, stabilizing 80% of the foam generator cell's height and remaining stable for 122 min during the EOR process. Conversely, ascorbic acid-SiO2-oleic acid JNPs displayed elevated foamability but reduced stability compared to SiO2-oleic acid JNPs. Despite achieving full height in the foam generator cell, stability was limited to 26 min in the CO2 medium.

To improve intersection traffic flow and reduce vehicle energy consumption and emissions at intersections, a signal optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. The algorithm uses Rainbow DQN as the core framework, incorporating vehicle position, speed, and acceleration information into the state space. The reward function simultaneously considers two objectives: reducing vehicle waiting times and minimizing carbon emissions, with the vehicle queue length as a weighted factor. Additionally, an ACmix module, which integrates self-attention mechanisms and convolutional layers, is introduced to enhance the model’s feature extraction and information representation capabilities, improving computational efficiency. The model is tested using an actual intersection as the study object, with a signal intersection simulation built in SUMO. The proposed approach is compared with traditional Webster signal timing, actuated signal timing, and control strategies based on DQN and D3QN models. The results show that the proposed strategy, through real-time signal timing adjustments, reduces the average vehicle waiting time by approximately 27.58% and the average CO2 emissions by about 7.34% compared with the actuated signal timing method. A comparison with DQN and D3QN models further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model, achieving a 15% reduction in average waiting time and a 6.5% reduction in CO2 emissions. The model’s applicability is validated under various scenarios, including different proportions of electric vehicles and traffic volumes. This study aims to provide a flexible signal control strategy to enhance intersection vehicle flow and reduce carbon emissions. It offers a reference for the development of green, intelligent transportation systems and holds practical significance for promoting urban carbon reduction efforts.

Abstract Plants commonly undergo leaf morphoanatomy and composition modifications to cope with drought stress, and these tend to reduce mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion (gm), a key limitation to photosynthesis. The cell wall appears to play a crucial role in this reduction, yet the specific effect of cell wall compositions on gm and the underlying regulatory mechanisms of cell wall thickness (Tcw) variation are not well understood. In this study, we subjected cotton plants to varying levels of water deficit to investigate the impact of leaf cell wall composition and the arrangement patterns of microfibrils within cell walls on Tcw and leaf gas exchange. Drought stress resulted in a significant thickening of cell walls and a decrease in gm. Concurrently, drought stress increased the content of chelator-soluble pectin and cellulose while reducing hemicellulose content. The alignment of cellulose microfibrils became more parallel and their diameter increased with under drought conditions, suggesting a decrease in cell wall effective porosity which coincides with the observed reduction in gm. This research demonstrates that reduced gm typically observed under drought stress conditions is related not only to thickened cell walls, but also to ultra-anatomical and compositional variations. Specifically, increases in cellulose content, diameter, and highly aligned arrangement collectively contributed to an increase in Tcw, which together with increases in chelator-soluble pectin content, resulted in an increased cell wall resistance to CO2 diffusion.

The Winners of the JWPE 3-Minute Pitch: "My Life in Water" event will each present a 15 minute talk about their research topic. The JWPE 3-Minute Pitch "My Life in Water" event, was a global initiative dedicated to celebrating outstanding PhD research in water processing and engineering. This initiative aims to support emerging researchers by providing a platform within the Journal of Water Process Engineering for them to showcase their work. Participants faced the challenge of distilling their research into a compelling three-minute presentation, using language accessible to a non-specialist audience. Congratulations to our winners and presnsters for this webinar: 1st place: Ms. Hanwei Yu, University of Technology Sydney, Australia for her presentation on Extracting Lithium from Water for a Sustainable Future 2nd place: Ms. Mbokazi Ngayeka, Nelson Mandela University, South Africa for her presentation on Synthesis of composite track-etched membranes for metal recovery in mine wastewater 3rd place: Ms. Jin Du, Tsinghua University, China for her presentation on Simultaneous CO2 reduction and Wastewater Treatment via Bioelectrochemical System Lithium Recovery from Aqueous Resources Using Capacitive Deionization (CDI) The increasing demand for lithium, driven by its vital role in energy storage technologies, underscores the need for efficient and sustainable recovery methods. Capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technology for lithium recovery from aqueous resources, such as seawater desalination brine, due to its low energy consumption, operational simplicity, and high adsorption efficiency. However, the selective recovery of lithium remains challenging due to the presence of massive competing ions. This presentation highlights my PhD research on enhancing lithium selectivity in CDI through three innovative strategies: employing nanomaterials with subnano-scale channels to leverage the size sieving effect, introducing functional groups with strong cation affinities, and utilizing lithium-ion sieves that exploit the material's memory effect. Experimental findings, detailed mechanism analyses, and potential applications for sustainable resource recovery will be discussed, paving the way for environmentally friendly lithium extraction solutions. Synthesis of composite track-etched membranes for metal recovery in mine wastewater Track-etched membranes (TEM) offer distinct advantages over conventional membranes and other solid supports due to their precisely determined structure and the fact that their pores sizes and thickness can be varied in a controllable manner. Composite membranes were fabricated by combining the products of ion-tracking and electrospinning processes. Swift heavy ions generated from a cyclotron were used to irradiate polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer film to create latent tracks which were then chemically etched in an alkaline solution, to produce tracks on the membrane. Magnetron sputtering was then used to deposit titanium (Ti) on the membrane to produce PET-TM. Ligand functionalized polyacrylonitrile nanofibres (PAN-nfs), polysulfone (PSN-nfs) and polystyrene (PSRN-nfs) were directly electrospun on the Ti coated PET-TEM using an electrospinning process creating the composite membrane. These track-etched membranes with specific pore sizes were functionalized with various ligands for scavenging Pt, Rh and Ir metal anions from mine waste water. The track-etched membrane, the nanofibres and the composite membrane were characterised using SEM, TEM, TGA, ATR-FTIR and adsorption/desorption of nitrogen techniques. Mean pore size and pore size distribution was determined using electrical conductivity and small angle X-ray scattering techniques. The results confirmed the fabrication of nanofibers-coated track-etched composite membranes. Filtration studies were conducted to assess the efficiency of the uptake of the platinum group metals and invariably separate Pt, Rh and Ir from mine wastewater. Microbial Electrosynthesis Systems for Efficient CO2 Reduction and Acetate Production Microbial electrosynthesis (MES), coupling the electrochemical process with bio-technology, is green and specific for CO2 reduction, for which the microbial cells as the biocatalyst attached on the cathode are self-sustaining, stable, and inexpensive to develop and maintain. The MES system is a hybrid of a bioreactor and an electrochemical reactor, which requires thorough understanding across its various aspects such as reactor optimization, electrode design, and process control. In this study, the preferred inorganic carbon form (gaseous CO2 or dissolved bicarbonate) for the MES system was discussed, highlighting the importance of CO2 supplying strategy to the start-up and steady operation of the MES system. The system performance and microbial communities suggested that feeding more gaseous CO2 would aid in microbial CO2 electroreduction. Furthermore, a facile and promising electrode modification strategy was developed for MES system with Fe-Mn bimetallic oxides, increasing the acetate production rate from 28 to 78 g/(m2·d). The underlying mechanisms were also highlighted, in particular the contributions of Mn and Fe individually and their synergistic effect on the microbial CO2 electroreduction, as well as the functional microbial species and the electron transfer pathways involved. Overall, this presentation will provide effective strategies and mechanistic insights for efficient and sustainable conversion of CO2 to valuable platform organic chemicals, bringing the world closer to achieving carbon neutrality.

The use of cellulose fiber-filled polypropylene (PP) composites in combination with foam injection molding has enabled the lightweight design of injection-molded parts. The study provides achievements for the physical foam injection molding (MuCell®) process of PP–cellulose fiber compounds by using CO2 as the direct foaming agent, including a comparison of MuCell® foaming with N2 and a comparison to a chemical foaming process. Weight and density reductions, foam structure and specific mechanical properties are highly dependent on the applied processing parameters. The maximum weight reduction reached values of up to 16%, and density reduction even reached 33% in relation to the compact plates. The extent of weight and density reduction could be adjusted, among other factors, by a reduction in the shot volume. Setting the density reduction to 22% allowed for simultaneously decreasing weight while sustaining the specific flexural properties and limiting the loss of specific impact strength. By using optimized FIM parameters, the mechanical performance could be improved, with specific modulus values even outperforming the compact reference sample. This presents a significant benefit for the preparation of lightweight products and sets the basis for further optimization and modeling studies.

Through oxidative calcination, pre-synthesized Co-doped brookite TiO2 nanorods transform into a mixed TiO2 phase, leading to the phase segregation of Co species. The resulting Co clusters, stabilized by strong Co-TiO2 interactions during reductive CO2 hydrogenation, effectively suppress the formation of larger nanoparticles. The undercoordinated sites of these clusters promote a high CO production rate with near-unit selectivity, contrasting with Co nanoparticles, which favor CH4 formation under identical conditions. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis indicates that the weakened CO adsorption on Co clusters is key to their enhanced CO selectivity, highlighting this method as a promising approach for efficient CO2 utilization.

Knowing the energy balance in agricultural systems is essential for a holistic understanding of sustainability, productivity and economic return. The aim of this study was to estimate the cumulative energy demand (CED), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon footprint in industrial potato and tomato production systems in the Southeast region of Brazil, identifying mitigation strategies in different scenarios. The Life Cycle Analysis methodology was used, and two functional units were defined: one hectare of cultivation and one kilogram of vegetable produced. The CEDs for tomato and potato production were 59,553.56 MJ ha–1 (or 0.54 MJ kg–1) and 57,992.02 MJ ha–1 (or 1.45 MJ kg–1), respectively. The GHG emissions were 5425.13 kg CO2 eq ha–1 for potato production and 5270.9 kg CO2 eq ha–1 for tomato production, resulting in carbon footprints of 0.135 and 0.042 kg CO2 eq kg–1, respectively. Fertilizers, diesel and pesticides were the main contributors to CED and GHG emissions. Thus, in order to achieve greater sustainability in the production of these vegetables and mitigate the impacts on the environment generated by the high demand for energy and GHG emissions, it is necessary to replace synthetic fertilizers with organic sources, chemical pesticides with biological pesticides, diesel with biodiesel or the use of electric vehicles and tractors, resulting in reductions of up to 39 and 52% in the GHG emissions for potatoes and tomatoes, respectively.

For several years now, electric cars (E-cars) have increasingly come into the public spotlight. This technology aims to provide alternatives to conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines while creating independence from politically unstable oil-producing countries. Another significant reason for this trend is the reduction of CO2 emissions to counteract the associated climate change. When powered by renewable energy sources such as wind or solar energy, E-cars theoretically avoid most of the CO2 emissions. However, from a consumer perspective, E-cars currently have two main disadvantages, such as high acquisition costs and limited range. Due to these two factors, it became imperative to be able to get accurate information about the batteries’ state, age, and range. Therefore, this article presents the main influential factors on vehicle range and a comprehensive study of different types of state of art modeling methods. The methodologies with their challenges and the necessity of using the relevant modeling methodology are described. Furthermore, experimental findings after 365 days are presented, using 60 Ah battery cells, to investigate different kinds of aging influence with various parameters like ambient temperature, charging current and depth of discharge.

Abstract This study was intended to provide a novel process that fills a knowledge gap in relation to the enhancement of pulses utilization. The primary goal was to develop an experimental framework for using a high‐pressure supercritical fluid extruder (SCFX) as a continuous bioreactor to produce off‐flavor reduced and functionally superior pulse flours and protein concentrates in a single step. The current study focused on using SCFX processing to remove off‐flavor from pulse flour and protein concentrates, enhancing the quality, acceptability, and marketability of pulse‐based products. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO 2 ), a well‐known green solvent, was employed in combination with an extrusion system to achieve off‐flavor reduction at larger scale. Using various methods such as headspace solid‐phase microextraction‐gas chromatography mass‐spectroscopy (HS‐SPME‐GC‐MS) and sensory evaluation, this study demonstrated that SCFX significantly reduced the off‐flavor in pea flour (PF) and pea protein concentrate (PPC). HS‐SPME‐GC‐MS analyses identified major off‐flavor compounds in unextruded PF and PPC, including 1‐hexanol, 1‐octanol, 1‐nonanol, nonanal, and 2‐alkyl methoxypyrazines. Following SCFX treatment, all these compounds except nonanal were removed. Total off‐flavor compound concentration dropped from 923 to 126.5 ng/g in PF, and from 571.7 to 65.9 ng/g in pea protein concentrate PPC after SCFX treatment. Sensory evaluation corroborated these HS‐SPME‐GC‐MS findings, showing that over 80% of the participants could accurately distinguish the extruded samples from the unextruded ones, perceiving the treated samples as having the least beany flavor. These findings highlight the efficacy of SCFX processing in enhancing the sensory profile of pulse‐based products by removing off‐flavor compounds.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the evolution of rock porosity and permeability due to geochemical interaction is vital for assessing the impact on CO2 storage performance in identified geological formations. This study focused on the influence of rock mineralogy on CO2-rock-fluid interactions and their effects on rock porosity and permeability for S field, which is high temperature, high in-situ CO2 content (∼70%) offshore carbonate field located in Malaysian waters. Two representative core samples, one from gas interval and another from the aquifer interval, were selected from the S field for unsteady-state core-flooding experiments conducted at reservoir conditions (35 MPa/5076 psi and 150° C). Pre- and post-flooding core characterization was carried out using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), X-Ray CT-imaging and porosity-permeability measurement to examine any petrophysical alteration resulting from the experiment. The results show that the gas interval sample exhibited a dissolution fingering pattern at the inlet face, induced by CO2 flooding, whereas the aquifer interval sample showed very limited changes. These observations were supported by increased gas porosity-permeability in the gas interval, as indicated by NMR porosity measurements and X-ray CT images showing fingering features, whereas no significant changes were detected in the aquifer interval sample. 1. INTRODUCTION CO2-rock-fluid interaction could result in alterations of the petrophysical properties (Hao et al., 2013; Zekri et al., 2013; Garing et al., 2015; Khather et al., 2017; Khather et al., 2020) and the multiphase flow characteristics (El-Maghraby and Blunt, 2013; Bennion and Bachu, 2020; Seyyedi et al., 2020) of both rock formation and the subsurface system. The rates of surface reaction are very high in carbonate reservoirs, where calcite reaction rate is 1 × 10−5 mol/cm2/s and for dolomite is 1 × 10−7 mol/cm2/s, which usually lead to greatly uneven rock minerals dissolution (Wellman et al., 2003; Egermann et al., 2005). Even though the rock porosity and permeability are expected to increase due to the dissolution of rock minerals, the change in temperature/pressure conditions at downhole conditions could result in rock minerals precipitation, counteracting the dissolution mechanism. The net effect of this process will result in reduction of rock effective porosity and permeability (Oomole and Osoba, 1983; Izgec et al., 2005).

Promoting rapid healing is a concern in skin wound treatment, as the increased pain and the loss of functional ability when wounds become chronic create a complex problem to manage. This scoping review aimed to explore the literature and synthesize existing knowledge on the therapeutic use of CO2 in treating cutaneous wounds. The literature was selected using previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 22 articles were selected for data extraction. The most researched type of injury was chronic wounds located on the extremities of the limbs. Carboxytherapy was performed in five different ways: subcutaneous, intradermal, or intralesional injections; in hot water baths with temperatures ranging from 30 to 42 °C; transcutaneous application; intra-abdominal insufflation; and a paste for transcutaneous local application. The main effects of CO2 therapy described were as follows: improved blood flow and local oxygenation, reduction of the inflammatory process, increased collagen production, and improved clinical aspects of wounds, with faster healing. Carboxytherapy can be considered a good alternative for treating skin wounds, although further studies should be pursued to elucidate its molecular mechanisms and enhance its efficacy.

Bulk Au is chemically inert and a relatively poor catalyst while Pt is catalytically active. Nanostructured Au is an effective photocatalyst due to hot electrons generated by interband- and intraband damping of surface plasmons. A bimetallic, mesoporous AuPt catalyst with a large specific surface area is highly desirable due to the combination of hot carrier and catalytic promoter effects together with a large number of active reaction sites. Sponge-shaped AuPt alloy nanoparticles were grown by spontaneous thermal dewetting of ultrathin AuPtAg films followed by dealloying through removal of Ag. Selective etching of silver from AuPtAg alloy precursors formed a porous AuPt sheet-like nanostructure with mesopores with an average size of 3.72 nm. Under AM1.5G one sun illumination, the AuPt nanosponge acted as a stand-alone photocatalyst for CO2 reduction by evolving CO at a rate of 1010 μmol g–1 h–1 with 100% selectivity. Scavenger experiments confirmed photogenerated electrons to be the driving force for chemical transformation as opposed to holes. AuPt nanosponge significantly outperformed bare Au nanosponge in both visible light-stimulated CO2 photoreduction and photooxidative degradation of methylene blue dye, which is attributed to a non-negligible photoinduced electron transfer from Au to Pt followed by electron transfer to reactants.

In order to realize carbon mitigation and the efficient utilization of waste biogas, the biogas-to-methanol process is an important method. The syngas produced by the conventional biogas reforming technology is rich in CO2 and CO, whereas it is poor in hydrogen. Therefore, additional H2 is introduced into the system to adjusted the syngas ratio, promoting the efficient conversion of the biogas. However, the use of traditional H2 production technologies generally results in considerable carbon emissions. Given these points, low-carbon H2 production technologies, namely methane pyrolysis technology and chemical looping reforming technology, are integrated with the biogas-to-methanol process to enhance carbon conversion, carbon reduction, and cost-saving potentials. Comprehensive technical and economic comparisons of the integrated processes are conducted. The process coupled with chemical looping reforming technology has a higher carbon conversion efficiency (73.52%) and energy efficiency (70.41%), and lower unit carbon emissions (0.73 t CO2/t methanol). Additionally, the process coupled with methane pyrolysis technology has higher product revenue, whereas that including chemical looping reforming technology has a lower net production cost (571.33 USD/t methanol). In summary, the novel chemical looping reforming technology provides a cleaner and more sustainable pathway with which to promote the efficient conversion of biogas into methanol.

Copper (Cu)‐based catalysts exhibit distinctive performance in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with complex mechanism and sophisticated types of products. The management of key intermediates *CO and *H is a necessary factor for achieving high product selectivity, but lack of efficient and versatile strategies. Herein, we designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single‐atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts (denoted as Cu‐Pt1 and Cu‐PtNPs) precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products up to 70.4% and the FE of CH4 reaching 57.7%, respectively. CO stripping experiments reveal that Pt1 sites could enhance the adsorption of *CO, while PtNPs exhibit *CO tolerance for H2O dissociation. In situ spectroscopic results further confirms that high coverage of *CO is achieved on Cu‐Pt1, while *CHO on Cu‐PtNPs might generate by additional water dissociation. As elucidated by theoretical studies, the interfacial sites of Cu‐Pt1 would favor the *CO coverage promoting the evolution of *OCCO for C2+ products while PtNPs supplementarily accelerate H2O dissociation achieving *CHO for CH4. This work provides insights for efficient and targeted CO2 conversion by atomically design of active sites with engineered key intermediates coverage.

The cultivation of fossil energy consumption in Henan Province between 2005 and 2022 is key to formulate carbon reduction strategies. This study uses the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to decompose the factors of carbon emissions. The total carbon emissions from fossil energy in Henan Province amounted to 3.075 billion tons of CO2, showing an initial increase followed by a decrease, with fluctuations ranging from 125.59 million tons to 209.98 million tons. The LMDI analysis results show that the total effect of fossil energy carbon emissions fluctuated over time. From 2006 to 2011, the total effect was 84.39 million tons. From 2012 to 2019, it was -56.70 million tons. rom 2020 to 2022, it was 14.93 million tons. The greatest positive impact is the economic factor, accounting for 52.36% of the total effect. The greatest negative impact is the technological factor, accounting for 46.32%.Based on this, the study proposes the following carbon reduction strategies: adjusting the energy structure, fostering green technological innovation, and enhancing energy consumption management.

A scalable electrochemical procedure for the synthesis of carboxylic acids from organic halides has been developed using a spinning cylinder electrode electrochemical reactor. The electrochemical process is based on the reductive dehalogenation of the starting material followed by trapping of the resulting carbanion with CO2. The protocol is compatible both with organic chlorides and bromides and uses inexpensive graphite and stainless steel as electrode materials. As sacrificial metal anodes are avoided, the method can be readily scaled up in flow mode. The procedure is compatible with a wide range of substrates (24 examples), including aryl and alkyl halides as well as heterocyclic compounds. Multigram scale preparations in flow mode have been demonstrated by processing 600 mL of reaction mixture in an electrolyte recirculation setup.

Abstract This paper aims to evaluate the integration of an underground heat exchanger with a single-effect absorption chiller along with solar parabolic trough collectors (PTC). The proposed sustainable system contributes to the reduction in CO2 emissions and lowers the energy consumption in residential buildings. The solar integrated cooling system is equipped with a bio-mass heater to provide space cooling during nighttime. The proposed integrated system was modelled and simulated using TRNSYS. Parametric analysis was conducted to optimize the system’s performance by varying the size of system’s components such as collector area and the volume of the storage tank. The developed system was implemented in two case studies. One is a villa located in Dubai with a cooling load of 175.2 kW/m2 and another one is in located in Abu Dhabi with a cooling load of 376.6 kW/m2. A cost analysis was performed to check the feasibility of the proposed model. The model was validated with the existing literature and showed good match in terms of the gained useful energy.

The integration of energy generation and consumption is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy-system-related waste, costs, and emissions in cities. This paper considers a university district consisting of 32 buildings where electrical demand is currently met by the national grid, and 31% of thermal demand is supplied by a centralized heating station through a district heating network; the remainder is covered by small, dedicated boilers. Starting from the present system, the goal is to identify “retrofit” design solutions to reduce cost, environmental impact, and the primary energy consumption of the district. To this end, three new configurations of the multi-energy system (MES) of the district are proposed considering (i) the installation of new energy conversion and storage units, (ii) the enlargement of the existing district heating network, and (iii) the inclusion of new branches of the electrical and heating network. The configurations differ in increasing levels of integration through the energy networks. The results show that the installation of cogeneration engines leads to significant benefits in both economic (up to −12.3% of total annual costs) and energy (up to −10.2% of the primary energy consumption) terms; these benefits increase as the level of integration increases. On the other hand, the limited availability of space for photovoltaics results in increased CO2 emissions when only total cost minimization is considered. However, by accepting a cost increase of 8.4% over the least expensive solution, a significant reduction in CO2 (−23.9%) can be achieved while still keeping total costs lower than the existing MES.

Geopolymer concrete is a sustainable alternative to conventional concrete, offering significant environmental protection and carbon reduction benefits. This study presents a comparative analysis between Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)-based conventional concrete (CC) and geopolymer concrete (GPC) utilizing ultrafine fly ash (UFFA) and ultrafine ground-granulated blast furnace slag (UFGGBS) as binders, with identical binder-to-aggregate ratios. GPC was developed using sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as alkaline activators, while CC relied on OPC as its binding agent. The mechanical properties and durability of GPC were evaluated under controlled conditions. The results demonstrated that GPC is comparable to CC in terms of strength and durability. Moreover, GPC reduces CO2 emissions by incorporating industrial by-products such as fly ash and slag as binders, replacing energy-intensive Portland cement and significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions. This underscores the potential of GPC as a sustainable, eco-friendly material for modern construction, supporting environmental conservation and sustainability.

The potential benefits of rice straw in organic farming in terms of rice productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, carbon sequestration rate (CSR) and global warming potential (GWP) were studied for five years covering 10 wet (kharif) and dry (rabi) seasons with a wide seasonal temperature range (28-31 C and 30-40 C during wet and dry seasons, respectively). Field experiments were conducted at the ICAR-IIRR, Hyderabad, in a black clayey vertisol. The organic sources used were rice straw + green manure in kharif and rice straw + poultry manure in rabi. Organic system resulted in initial yield reduction by 15-20 % than inorganic system and yields stabilized after two and five years in wet and dry seasons, respectively, with improved soil health parameters. The SOC stocks were higher with organics by 34-43 % compared to inorganics after five years of study. The CSR was also positive with organics (0.97 and 0.57 t/ha/ year during wet and dry seasons, respectively) compared to inorganics (-021 and -0.33 t/ha/year during wet and dry seasons, respectively) which recorded negative C sequestration rate. Organics recorded favourable C sequestration even under dry situations which is more desirable to mitigate the adverse effects of global warming to certain extent by reducing CO2 emissions. The global warming potential under organic system was 20 % higher than in conventional system with increased CO2 and CH4 and reduced N2O emissions. Since GWP was higher with rice straw, mixing of straw with other potential organics in proper proportions reduce the GWP in addition to carbon sequestration in organic rice cultivation.

This study sought to evaluate the value of a CO2 field-flooding device in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgical procedures for congenital heart disease (CHD) performed via a right-side small incision approach. Between April 2022 and December 2023, 234 children with simple CHD who underwent CPB via a right-side small incision approach were separated into a control group (n = 93) without the use of a CO2 field-flooding device and a treatment group (n = 141) in which this device was added to the traditional surgical manual exhaust. Demographic, perioperative, arterial blood gas (ABG), and laboratory test data were then compared between these groups of patients. There was a significant difference in abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) after aorta de-clamping during CPB, and interventions for abnormal ECG after aorta de-clamping during CPB between the control and treatment groups (17(18.3%) vs.14(9.9%), P = 0.048;12(85.7%) vs.7(50%),P = 0.013). The treatment group exhibited a lower pH (7.34 ± 0.07 vs. 7.36 ± 0.06, P = 0.039) and a higher PaCO2 (43.08 ± 7.36 vs. 38.86 ± 5.65 mmHg, P = 0.042) at the time of 30 min after initiation of CPB. A significant reduction in postoperative CK-MB was observed in treatment group (41.20 ± 17.88 vs. 56.57 ± 22.99 U/L, P = 0.002). Lower 3-day postoperative CRP levels were also observed in the treatment group relative to control (5.77 ± 0.48 vs. 9.45 ± 0.98 mg/L, P < 0.001). The S100ß concentration in the relevant patient cohort increased significantly from the time just after induction, intubation, and installation of the right central venous line to the time of admission to CCU (71.61 ± 11.83 vs. 124.04 ± 38.80, P = 0.01) and at the time of 24 h after operation (71.61 ± 11.83 vs. 101.97 ± 30.31, P = 0.01). No differences on S100β serum concentration level were found at the time of installation of the right central venous line between two groups. But there were statistically significant differences in S100β serum concentration level at the time of admission to CCU between control group and treatment group. (161.19 ± 6.62 vs. 86.89 ± 9.69 pg/ml, P = 0.01). Similar results were observed at the time of 24 h after operation. (127.62 ± 19.44 vs. 76.33 ± 10.40, P = 0.01). These data suggest that the CO2 field-flooding device can safely be used when performing CPB surgical procedures via a right-side small incision approach to treat CHD without hypercapnia. The use of such a CO2 field-flooding device at a flow rate of 5 L/min may help protect against cardiac and nervous system damage in children undergoing CHD surgery.

The sand from the processing of iron ore has been widely used in civil construction in Brazil, especially in the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and São Paulo. It is used as fine aggregate in the production of mortars, cement products and concrete. With the possibility of producing new sand in several iron ore mines in the state of Minas Gerais, the present study aimed to develop and analyze concrete dosages with various ore sands and sands present in the industrial market in the Belo Horizonte region. The replacement of natural river sand with mining sand in concrete dosages was evaluated and the Abrams curves were analyzed for the various dosages developed. It was possible to observe a performance gain in the dosages carried out with ore sands, with a reduction of up to 7% in cement consumption in the mixes. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of mining sand in the production of concrete is efficient, with technical and productive gains, promoting sustainable construction, reducing CO2 and promoting the circular economy in the construction chain.

In the CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR), the product selectivity is strongly dependent on the binding energy differences of the key intermediates. Herein, we systematically evaluated the CO2RR reaction pathways on single transition metal atom doped catalysts TM1Cu/Cu2O by density functional theory (DFT) methods and found that *CO is more likely to undergo C-O bond cleavage rather than be hydrogenated on TM1Cu/Cu2O (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which facilitates C2+ production with a low-energy pathway of OC-C coupling, while it prefers to be hydrogenated to form CHO on TM1Cu/Cu2O (TM = Ni, Cu). The defects of Cu in TM1Cu/Cu2O were confirmed to enhance the production of ethanol. Furthermore, we established a scaling relationship between binding free energies of the key intermediates with the Bader charges of the active sites TM on TM1Cu/Cu2O and defective TM1Cu/Cu2O surfaces. This relationship facilitates a rational and efficient design of Cu/Cu2O-based catalysts.

Currently, 80% of conventional energy is used to meet the needs of industry and the general public. Using new, renewable energy from the sun is an effort to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gases (GHG). Al-Jihad Boarding School, an Islamic educational institution with around 1,200 students, is one of the biggest consumers of conventional energy. This study aims to plan photovoltaic solar cells, calculate the amount of power that can be generated, calculate the amount of GHG emission reduction from photovoltaic solar cells and the costs required for installation at Al-Jihad Islamic Boarding School. The planning results were analyzed by adjusting the selection of a 12 KVA inverter, 44 polycrystalline photovoltaic solar cells, and other complementary materials such as cables, MCBs and supports. The amount of power generated from photovoltaic solar cells at the Al-Jihad Islamic Boarding School in Surabaya is 12 kWh. Climate change mitigation efforts by reducing GHG emissions through solar cell photovoltaic planning at the Al-Jihad Islamic Boarding School in Surabaya can reduce CO2 greenhouse gases by 1,200.5 kg, NH4 30.013 kg, and N2O 0.019 kg. The cost required for the installation of photovoltaic solar cells is Rp. 209,850,400.

Abstract Significant uncertainties in terrestrial carbon fluxes exist in regions with limited ground-based observations, impacting our understanding of ecosystem carbon dynamics and emission reduction needs. This is particularly true for areas with sparse measurement networks, like India. To address this, we explore the potential of satellite measurements from various missions such as Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) to improve terrestrial biosphere CO2 fluxes of India. We follow a data-driven approach, which simulates spatial and temporal distributions of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), and ecosystem Respiration (Reco). We improve these model predictions by additionally using satellite-based Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), Soil Temperature (ST), and Soil Moisture (SM) specific to the vegetation classes of the domain. Different model refinements were performed to present the improved hourly distributions of terrestrial biospheric CO2 fluxes on a 0.1◦×0.1◦ grid from 2012 to 2020. Among them, the best-performing model simulations show reasonable agreement with eddy covariance observations for 2012 - 2018. For example, our best NEE and GPP predictions are highly correlated with observations with squared correlation coefficient (R2) values of 0.68 (NEE) and 0.74 (GPP) at the monthly scale for 2018. Based on our improved estimations, the annual NEE and GPP show values within the range from -0.38 Pg C yr-1 to -0.53 Pg C yr-1 (land C sink) and 3.39 Pg C yr-1 to 3.88 Pg C yr-1, respectively over India for 2012 - 2020. Our novel approach and findings highlight the potential of satellite-based SIF measurements to detail the ecosystem-scale vegetation responses across various biomes in India. The use of satellite observations, as demonstrated in this study, offers a scalable solution for regions lacking sufficient ground-based observations to estimate biospheric carbon fluxes reliably.

Recent work demonstrated that 50:50 sand-recycled polycarbonate (rPC) composites have an average compressive strength of 71 MPa, which dramatically exceeds the average offered by commercial concrete (23.3–30.2 MPa). Due to the promising technical viability of replacing carbon-intensive concrete with recycled sand plastic composites, this study analyzes the cradle-to-gate environmental impacts with a life cycle assessment (LCA). Sand-to-plastic composites (50:50) in different sample sizes were fabricated and the electricity consumption monitored. Cumulative energy demand and IPCC global warming potential 100a were evaluated to quantify energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission associated with sand–plastic brick and two types of concrete, spanning the life cycle from raw material extraction to use phase. The results showed that at small sizes using Ontario grid electricity, the composites were more carbon-intensive than concrete, but as samples increased to standard brick–scale rPC composite bricks, they demonstrated significantly lower environmental impact, emitting 96% less CO2/cm3 than sand–virgin PC (vPC) composite, 45% less than ordinary concrete, and 54% less than frost-resistant concrete. Energy sourcing has a significant influence on emissions. Sand–rPC composite achieves a 67–98% lower carbon footprint compared to sand–vPC composite and a 3–98% reduction compared to both types of concrete. Recycling global polycarbonate production for use in sand–rPC composites, though small compared to the total market, could annually displace approximately 26 Mt of concrete, saving 4.5–5.4 Mt of CO2 emissions. The results showed that the twin problems of carbon emissions from concrete and poor plastic recycling could be partially solved with sand–rPC building material composites to replace concrete.

Abstract Reducing building-related CO2 emissions requires decreasing energy consumption and/or adopting cleaner, more efficient technologies. Air source heat pumps (ASHPs) are increasingly favored for building heating, especially in mild climates. When powered by clean and renewable energy sources, they offer significant potential for emission reduction. However, cold climates present unique challenges for these conventional heating systems, prompting interest in integrating renewable energy sources such as solar energy and energy storage with ASHPs to maintain consistent performance and lower their energy use during the coldest days. This study investigates the performance of an air source heat pump integrated with a solar air collector for domestic water heating in a cold climate. The study aims to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the solar air collector to the overall reduction in energy consumption, enabling a thorough assessment of the integrated system’s efficiency and operational performance. The coupled air collector – ASHP – TES tank model was developed using a transient system simulation tool (TRNSYS). The impact of collector orientation, with tilt angles between 30 and 70°, collector surface areas between 8 and 16 m2 and mass flow rates ranging from 0.25 to 1 kg/s, which are considered suitable for a 2-ton heat pump, were systematically examined. Results show that the optimal tilt angle for maximizing useful annual energy gain is 51°, aligned with Calgary’s latitude, surpassing alternative tilt angles (30, 40, 60, and 70°). Furthermore, the integration of the solar air collector improves the annual average coefficient of performance (COP) by 16 % and reduces the annual average compressor work by 8%. This comprehensive analysis highlights the potential of integrating solar energy with ASHPs to enhance hot water efficiency and reduce energy consumption in cold climates.

Abstract Researchers are addressing challenges transitioning from natural gas to hydrogen, particularly in transportation and compression. This study evaluates the performance of a gas turbine compression system that compresses gaseous fuel, focusing on a SolarTurbines TAURUS 60 gas turbine with an output power of 5740 kW and nominal efficiency of 32 %. The 12-stage Solar C33 compressor achieves a maximum total head of 257 kJ/kg and an isentropic efficiency above 80%. Energetic, exergetic, and exergoeconomic analyses were conducted for various hydrogen/natural gas mixtures. The results indicate a reduction in CO2 emissions of 187.5 kg per ton of fuel processed with every 10% increase in hydrogen content. Furthermore, setting the oxygen percentage in turbine exhaust gases at 14% and increasing the hydrogen content by 50% reduced the air and fuel requirements by approximately 15%. The Turbine-Air Compressor Work Ratio decreased with higher hydrogen fractions, enhancing the compression train energy efficiency from 6.28% to 27.21%. Exergy analysis revealed decreased total exergy destruction and increased exergetic efficiencies with increasing hydrogen percentage, except for the combustion chamber and gas turbine. Exergoeconomic analysis indicated an increase in the specific cost of gas with higher hydrogen fractions, reaching $20.56/Gj for 100% hydrogen.

Ethyl alcohol is a known additive to automotive gasoline. In commercially available gasolines, its concentration is between 5 and 10%. Since ethyl alcohol can be considered as a renewable fuel, efforts are being made to further increase its content in gasoline. This article describes the results of comparison experiments on a Euro 5 direct injection spark-ignition car engine fueled with conventional gasoline and gasoline with 30% v/v ethyl alcohol content (E30). The test results showed that a significant share of ethanol in the fuel did not affect most of the regulated emissions of gaseous components (namely: CO, HC, NO), i.e., a three-way catalyst effectively removed these components, regardless of the fuel composition. Slightly lower CO2 emissions with the E30 fuel were noticeable. A significant difference, however, in lower particulate number emissions for the fuel with high-ethanol content was seen. At high engine load, the use of the E30 fuel resulted in a tenfold reduction in particulate number emissions. This might be considered as a very valuable effect of ethanol since direct injection spark-ignition engines are typically characterized by higher particulate emissions compared to engines equipped with other types of injection systems.

Silica aerogels are extensively used as catalyst supports due to their mesoporous structure and chemical inertness. In this study, SiO2–AuNP aerogels containing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized using the sol-gel method followed by supercritical CO2 drying. The inclusion of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a stabilizing agent preserved the gold particle sizes during the gelation process. In contrast, aerogels synthesized without PVP contained enlarged AuNP aggregates, resulting in a shift in the plasmon resonance color from red to bluish or blue–grey. Thermal treatment of these bluish-colored aerogels at high temperatures restored their red coloration, visually indicating the breakdown of large gold clusters into individual nanoparticles. Both types of aerogels were characterized using SEM, TEM, 3D optical microscopy, UV–vis and ATR-IR spectroscopy, and N2 porosimetry, with their properties analyzed as a function of annealing temperature. Their catalytic activity was evaluated through the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with sodium borohydride, and both aerogel types demonstrated catalytic activity. This thermal conversion of large clusters into individual nanoparticles within an aerogel matrix introduces a new and promising approach for creating catalytically active nanogold-containing aerogel catalysts.

The second (2nd) and third (3rd) segment of Ciliwung middle-stream watershed land use have changed drastically over the past two decades. This paper analyses the land use change from 1989-2012 and its impact on decreasing carbon stock or increasing CO2 eq emission, as well as to establish projected Reference Level (RL) to 2020. Best RL projection was used to establish the Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) in both segments. The land use changing from 1989-2012 indicated a reduction of green space area by 2,575.57 ha whereas the non-green space area increased by 2,575.57 ha. These changes decreases the carbon stock by 26,900 ton C and released CO eq emission by about 98,723 ton CO2eq. Population growth, demand on land and land constraints were found to be the driving factors of land use changes in this area. Reference Level 2020 was established based on business as usual (BAU) and forward looking (FL) scenarios. The projection showed that FL was the best scenario which estimated carbon storage at 217,610 ton C in 2020. Low carbon development strategy directed to the area of green space added up to 20% carbon storage through the implementation of the strategy based on green space and non-green space which covered the areas from protection, supervision, extension or awareness and law enforcement.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During the second half of the last century in Europe, district heating systems (DHS) have been built intensively to supply cities and settlements with heat energy.&lt;br /&gt;Taking into account that energy prices at that time were low, there was an economic justification for the construction of expensive infrastructural distribution systems. After the first oil shock of the seventies of the last century, there was a review of the consumption of petroleum products (mainly oil) as fuel in the heat sources of the DHS.&lt;br /&gt;The European Union, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the heat energy sector has long-term goals that are aimed at increasing the DHS to 30% by 2030, or 50% by 2050, in that of the current DHS of 12%. The present (current) state of the district heating system in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republic of Srpska and Federation BiH) is presented. The paper covers the technical, technological, supply, distribution, environmental, economic and market parameters of DHS in BiH. The institutional and legislative framework is presented in the previous paper, the comparison of parameters was made in relation to the cities of other countries in transition. The main conclusions are that in the cities of BiH (in the RS and FBiH) the small utilization of the district heating system is outdated, Investing in new ones requires significant investment funds, there are small movements in the application and introduction of renewable energy sources such as biomass, and in this connection, there is a small impact on CO2 emission reductions, large losses in heat distribution have been identified, and a market situation that is distinguished still high energy prices and pricing of heat service dominantlly is based on the surface of the space.&lt;/p&gt;

Mass transfer governs the overall catalytic performance of heterogeneous catalysts considerably; however, this fundamental research has often been ignored. Here, macroporous SiO2-supported Pt nanoparticle (Pt/SiO2-M) and mesoporous SiO2-supported Pt nanoparticle (Pt/SiO2-m) catalysts were specifically fabricated by a facile thermal reduction step to engineer the resultant Pt nanoparticles showing similar physiochemical properties while possessing completely different porous microstructures exclusively originating from SiO2 supports. On this basis, a platform to explore the crucial mass transfer difference affecting catalytic activity is then established by systematically practicing industry-important benzene oxidation measurements. State-of-the-art characterization techniques confirmed that all of the as-synthesized Pt/SiO2 catalysts indeed exhibited almost identical Pt sites, excluding catalytic discrepancies raised from Pt nanoparticles. Importantly, Pt/SiO2-M displayed complete benzene oxidation capabilities at a lower temperature than that for Pt/SiO2-m, accrediting to the macroporosity-induced faster desorption rate of H2O and CO2, thus making it capable of enhancing the high utilization of Pt sites. This work highlights the importance of improving mass transfer capability toward supported nanoparticulate catalysts, demonstrating the significance of designing novel macroporous supports for industry-important catalysis implications.

The increasing emphasis on environmental sustainability and stricter gas emissions regulations has made the optimization of fuel and emissions a crucial factor for marine propulsion systems. This paper investigates the potential to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of LNG ship propulsion systems by using different load sharing strategies in Dual-Fuel Diesel-Electric (DFDE) propulsion systems. Using data collected from on-board cyclic measurements and an optimization model, the effects of different load sharing strategies for various types of fuel, such as HFO, MDO, and LNG, under different engine load conditions were investigated. The results of these strategies are compared with those of on-board power management systems (PMS), which evenly allocate power among the engines, irrespective of fuel usage and emission levels. The results show that load adjustments according to the optimization model can considerably increase fuel economy and contribute to the reduction of CO2 and NOx compared to standard practice at the equal load in different ship operating modes. Our approach introduces an innovative optimization concept that has been proven to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions beyond standard practices. This paper demonstrates the robustness of the model in balancing environmental and operational objectives and presents an effective approach for more sustainable and efficient ship operations. The results are in line with global sustainability efforts and provide valuable insights for future innovations in energy optimization and ship emission control.

Ammonia is one of the common inorganic pollutants in surface waters. It can come from a wide range of sources through the discharge of wastewater (industry, agriculture, and municipal waters). Catalytic ozonation reaction can efficiently remove ammonia nitrogen without introducing other pollutants and improve the nitrogen selectivity of reaction products by controlling the reaction conditions. Catalysts based on silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have shown excellent O3 decomposition performance; therefore, they are promising catalysts for catalytic ammonia ozonation due to their high reactivity, stability, and selectivity to N2. In this study, we synthesized well-defined silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using a modified alkaline polyol method and then dispersed them on solid oxide supports (Fe3O4, TiO2, and WO3). Before being deposited on the oxide support, the silver nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-VIS spectroscopy. The obtained catalysts, Ag_Fe3O4, Ag_TiO2, and Ag_WO3 were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET surface area analysis, UV-VIS spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2 and NH3. It has been demonstrated that the nature of the support significantly influences the physicochemical properties of the catalysts, as well as their catalytic performance in ammonia ozonation reaction.

Electrochemically grown copper nanoclusters (CuNCs: < 3 nm) from single‐atom catalysts have recently attracted intensive attention as electrocatalysts for CO2 and CO reduction reaction (CO2RR/CORR) because they exhibit distinct product selectivity compared with conventional Cu nanoparticles (typically larger than 10 nm). Herein, we conducted a detailed investigation into the size dependence of CuNCs on selectivity for multicarbon (C2+) production in CORR. These nanoclusters were electrochemically grown from single Cu atoms dispersed on covalent triazine frameworks (Cu‐CTFs). Operando X‐ray absorption fine structure analysis revealed that Cu‐CTFs containing 1.21 wt% and 0.41 wt% Cu (Cu(h)‐CTFs and Cu(l)‐CTFs, respectively) formed CuNCs of 2.0 and 1.1 nm, respectively, at −1.0 V vs. RHE. The selectivity for CORR products was particularly dependent on the size of CuNCs, with the Faraday efficiencies of C2+ products being 52.3% and 32.7% at −1.0 V vs. RHE with Cu(h)‐CTFs and Cu(l)‐CTFs, respectively. Spherical CuNCs modeling revealed that larger cluster sizes led to a greater proportion of a surface coordination number (SCN) of 8 or 9. Density functional calculations revealed that the CO dimerization reaction was more likely to proceed at SCNs of 8 or 9 compared to SCN of 7 because of the stability of the *OCCO intermediate.

With the increasing emphasis on emission reduction targets, the low-carbon sustainable transformation of industrial energy supply systems is crucial. Addressing the urgent issue of reducing industrial carbon emissions, this study presents an integrated industrial energy supply system (IRE-CCUS-BESS-SPS) that incorporates renewable energy; calcium-based carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); and battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to improve energy efficiency and sustainability. The system model is designed to achieve a cost-effective and environmentally low-impact energy supply, validated through Aspen Plus V11.0 and Matlab R2019b simulations. The system’s performance is evaluated using a 4E index system encompassing economy, environment, energy, and exergy. The findings indicate that the system’s lifetime net present value (NPV) is positive, with a payback period of 6.09 years. Despite a 12.9% increase in the overall economic cost, carbon emissions are significantly reduced by 59.78%. The energy supply composition includes 48.60% from fuel oil and 22.10% from biomass, with an additional 270.04 kW of heat provided by waste heat boilers. The equalization costs for CO2 removal (LCCR) and methanation (LCOM) are 122.95 CNY/t and 10908.35 CNY/t, respectively, both exceeding current carbon emission trading costs and methane prices. This research offers a robust framework for designing sustainable industrial energy systems that integrate renewable energy, CCUS, and energy storage technologies for low-carbon operations. The analysis also suggests that government policies, such as direct financial subsidies or tax relief, are effective in accelerating the adoption of CCUS technology.

Ruminants play a crucial role in the food chain, but are also considered contributors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions . Essential oils (EOs) are emerging as natural feed additives in ruminants' nutrition to enhance animal health, performance and reduce environmental footprint. Among EOs, lemongrass (Cymbopogon winterianus) and oregano (Origanum vulgare) EOs (LEO and OEO) have attracted attention as modulators of ruminal fermentations, but their role needs to be clarified. The experiment was designed using a randomised setup to assess the effects of LEO and OEO on in vitro ruminal fermentation and GHGs, using total mixed ration (TMR) as substrate (incubation time 24h). Experimental treatments included (doses as % of TMR on DM basis): 1) control only TMR (0% EOs) 2) 0.07% LEO 3) 0.07% OEO 4) 0.035% LEO + 0.035% OEO 5) 0.07% LEO + 0.07% OEO. Each treatment was repeated three times in two experimental runs. Only EO combinations reduced total gas (−9%, p=0.001). All EOs decreased CO2 emissions by −5 to −12% with no significant differences between treatments (p<0.001), although anti-methanogenic effects were not observed (p=0.192). Volatile fatty acids were slightly affected only by EOs blend at the highest dose, resulting in a reduction of propionate (−1.3%, p=0.02), an increase in acetate:propionate (+0.16%, p=0.04) and isovalerate (+0.7%, p=0.03). LEO reduced pH (−0.6%, p=0.004), while OEO increased oxidation capacity (+4.2%, p=0.004), but both parameters remained within physiological ranges. Canonical discriminant analysis confirmed distinct EOs effects, highlighting their potential as natural additives for improving ruminal fermentation and mitigating ruminant environmental footprint.

ABSTRACT: Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized petrophysical analysis by providing advanced tools to efficiently interpret well-log data and predict reservoir properties. In this study, key well logs, including Gamma Ray (GR), Resistivity (LLD, LLS, and MSFL), Neutron Porosity (NPHI), Bulk Density (RHOB), and Sonic (DT), were utilized to evaluate reservoir characteristics in the Meyal Oilfield. Supervised ML algorithms, such as Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Extra Trees Regressor (ETR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), were deployed to predict critical properties, including porosity, permeability, water saturation, and shale volume. Dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques like K-Means further enhanced feature selection and geological interpretation. The application of ensemble learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs) demonstrated exceptional accuracy in automating well-log interpretation, surpassing traditional methods in efficiency and precision. In addition, seismic data analysis was conducted using 2D seismic lines, integrating ML-predicted petrophysical properties with structural interpretation. Horizons corresponding to the Sakesar and Chorgali formations were delineated, revealing structural traps and fault systems crucial for hydrocarbon accumulation. This study underscores the transformative role of ML in subsurface reservoir characterization, highlighting its potential to optimize hydrocarbon exploration and production strategies in complex geological environments like the Potwar Basin. 1. INTRODUCTION Artificial neural networks (NNs) have been used in a study to forecast how well CO2 foam flooding will work to improve oil recovery on a lab scale. Using petrophysical data, created a model that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast the porosity and permeability of petroleum reservoirs in addition to reservoir characteristics modeling, many scientists have created data-driven methods for wax deposition prediction and applied advanced machine learning techniques to the problems encountered in engineering, construction, and other industries (Akkurt et al., 2018). A comparative analysis of the integration of different machine-learning methods used to estimate the energy efficiency of buildings’ heating loads for smart city design. ML-based models to forecast permeability impairment due to scale deposition were studied, along with a comparison of various ML techniques for estimating the permeability and porosity of oil reservoirs using petrophysical logs (Al-Khalifa et al., 2020). When compared to traditional methods, it was found that the Extra Trees Regressor performed exceptionally well in estimating the volume of shale and porosities, while RFR and DTC were the most effective in modeling Sw and facies. This is ascribed to its capacity to accurately detect patterns in the training data and hence model reservoir features (Zhang et al., 2021). With a time-efficient approach and optimized results, suggested machine learning algorithms have effectively addressed the drawbacks of traditional methods, including generalization and data range, for petrophysical prediction without requiring extensive use of geological or lithological characteristics of the reservoir formation as shown in Figure 1 By adding more realistic data (core) and comprehensive data sets from all over the world with difficult reservoirs, this strategy can be further enhanced (Najwa et al., 2023) With a variety of inputs, machine learning algorithms can gain experience without being specifically designed to do so. Classification, continuous value prediction, and performance or event forecasting are among the predictions that may be made using the built model (Bader et al., 2019).

Abstract Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex and recurring inflammatory disorder that affects the gastrointestinal tract.1 Various drugs have been developed for treating IBD, but there are still limitations due to adverse effects experienced by patients.2 Plant-derived molecules with anti-inflammatory properties represent a valuable alternative as a complementary therapy for IBD.3 Isatin is a compound found in several medicinal plant species with various biological activities, including a modulatory effect on pro-inflammatory mediators. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of isatin in experimental colitis. Methods Rats were divided into three groups (10 animals/group): Saline (non-colitic control), TNBS (colitic untreated), and isatin (colitic treated with isatin 6 mg/kg). After anesthesia with ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), the TNBS and isatin groups received a single dose of TNBS (10 mg) dissolved in 0.25 mL of 50% ethanol (v/v) by rectal administration. To evaluate the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of isatin, animals were treated 2, 24, and 48 hours after the TNBS challenge and euthanized after 72 hours by CO2 overdose. The colons were removed, the macroscopic inflammation and the colon weight/length ratio were measured and the cytokines IL-1β, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α were quantified by ELISA. Median (minimum-maximum) or mean ± SEM values were compared through the Kruskal-Wallis test (Dunn’s test) or two-way ANOVA (Tukey’s test). The experiments were approved by the Ethics Commission in Animal Use (Protocol number 2773-1). Results The TNBS group showed increased colonic wall thickness and inflammatory cell infiltration. Isatin reduced the macroscopic inflammation score [Isatin: 6 (6-7) versus TNBS: 9 (8-10); p &lt; 0.01] promoted by TNBS instillation. Oral administration of isatin prevented the increase in the colon weight/length ratio (0.151 ± 0.017 versus 0.192 ± 0.015; p &lt; 0.01). The colonic damage caused by TNBS instillation was also characterised by an increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to the Saline group. In contrast, isatin reduced the levels of TNF-α (2.42 ± 0.72 versus 6.32 ± 1.91; p&lt;0.001), IFN-γ (4.26 ± 1.15 versus 7.34 ± 0.48; p&lt;0.01), IL-1β (16.54 ± 4.76 versus 35.91 ± 4.11; p&lt;0.001), and IL-12 (13.38 ± 3.65 versus 28.87 ± 8.39; p&lt;0.01) while increased the levels of IL-10 (6.41 ± 0.60 versus 4.82 ± 0.26; p&lt;0.01) when compared with TNBS group. Conclusion Isatin decreased the macroscopic inflammation score and the colon weight/length ratio. The action of isatin on colitis involves the reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-1β and increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, suggesting a potential curative role of isatin in colitis therapy.
