Background The Indonesian government built the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) in Jakarta to reduce traffic congestion and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The objective of this study is to estimate the CO2 emissions reductions from switching from private transport to MRT by using a methodology proposed by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for developing countries, namely the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) methodology, which generates Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). This methodology is more comprehensive than other available methodologies. However, this method has not been widely used to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in mass transit projects because it is complex enough to require a lot of data based on primary surveys. Therefore, this research simplifies the CDM formula to make it easier and applicable in Indonesia. Methods The primary data were collected using a questionnaire distributed to 480 MRT Jakarta Phase 1 user respondents in September 2019 (baseline); the secondary data were obtained from The MRT Jakarta. The data were processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27. The simplified Clean Development Mechanism Approved Consolidated Methodology 0016 (CDM ACM 0016) was the analysis method used. Result The results of this study indicate that 53.75% of MRT Jakarta Phase 1 users are shifting from private transportation, which has reduced CO2 emissions by 2,732.7 tons in 2019 and 6,043.9 tons in 2023. Increasing the number of MRT passengers who switch from private transportation will further reduce CO2 emissions. Conclusion and implications The simplified CDM ACM 0016 formula may be suitable for use in Indonesia. This would enable the measurement of CO2 emission reductions through mitigation actions through MRT development to be certified by the UNFCCC. Applying this method in calculating CO2 emission reductions, implementing strategies to increase MRT passengers, and using renewable energy electricity sources would increase CO2 emission reductions.

Abstract. One of the proposed ways to reduce the climate impact of civil aviation is rerouting aircraft to minimise the formation of warming contrails. As this strategy may increase fuel consumption, it would only be beneficial if the climate impact reduction from the avoided contrails exceeds the negative impact of any additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the rerouted flight. In this study, we calculate the surface temperature response of almost half a million flights that crossed the North Atlantic sector in 2019 and compare it to the temperature response of hypothetical rerouted flights. The climate impacts of contrails and CO2 are assessed through the perspective of CO2-equivalence metrics, represented here as nine combinations of different definitions and time horizons. We estimate that the total emitted CO2 and the persistent contrails formed will have warmed the climate by 17.2 µK in 2039, 13.7 µK in 2069, and 14.1 µK in 2119. Under an idealised scenario where 1 % additional carbon dioxide is enough to reroute all contrail-forming flights and avoid contrail formation completely, total warming would decrease by 4.9 (−28 %), 2.6 (−19 %), and 1.9 (−13 %) µK in 2039, 2069, and 2119, respectively. In most rerouting cases, the results based on the nine different CO2-equivalence metrics agree that rerouting leads to a climate benefit, assuming that contrails are avoided as predicted. But the size of that benefit is very dependent on the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics, contrail efficacy and CO2 penalty. Sources of uncertainty not considered here could also heavily influence the perceived benefit. In about 10 % of rerouting cases, the climate damage resulting from contrail avoidance indicated by CO2-equivalence metrics integrated over a 100-year time horizon is not predicted by metrics integrated over a 20-year time horizon. This study highlights, using North Atlantic flights as a case study, the implications of the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance, but the choice of metric implies a focus on a specific climate objective, which is ultimately a political decision.

Carbon dioxide storage is a technology to separate carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere and inject it into the brackish water layer to achieve the purpose of carbon dioxide emission reduction. In this way, carbon dioxide is dissolved in salt water and then sequestered in deep underground water layers, preventing it from being released into the atmosphere and causing a greenhouse effect. This technology can effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but also can use geological structures for storage, has great potential application prospects. It is important to note that further research and practice is needed to address possible environmental risks and costs.

Abstract Background Haemodialysis treatments generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly as a result of the equipment, consumables and pharmaceuticals required. An internal audit demonstrated a 33% wastage of acid concentrate when using individual 5.0 L containers at a 1:44 dilution ratio. We therefore investigated whether changing the delivery system for acid concentrate would reduce wastage and any associated greenhouse gas emissions. Methods We calculated the difference for a 30-bed dialysis unit between receiving acid concentrate in single-use 5.0 L plastic containers versus bulk delivery for a central acid delivery system connected to the dialysis machines. Estimates of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions were made using the United Kingdom government database and other sources. Results A 30-station dialysis unit functioning at maximum capacity (3 shifts and 6 days/week), switching to bulk delivery and central acid delivery could realise an approximate total reduction of 33,841 kgCO 2 e/year; in reduced product wastage, saving 6192 kgCO 2 e, 5205 kgCO 2 e from fewer deliveries, and 22,444 kgCO 2 e saving from a reduction in packaging and waste generated, which equates approximately to a one tonne reduction in CO 2 e emissions per dialysis station/year. Conclusions Switching from delivering acid concentrate in individual 5.0 L containers to a central acid delivery system can result in substantial reductions in CO 2 e emissions within a dialysis clinic. The emission savings from reducing the single-use plastic packaging greatly outweigh any gains from eliminating wastage of acid concentrate. Dialysis companies and clinicians should consider reviewing the design of current and future dialysis facilities and policies to determine whether reductions in CO 2 e emissions can be made.

Abstract Livestock methane (CH4) emissions total over 3 billion tonnes per year of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) and are responsible for approximately 6% of total annual greenhouse gas emissions. The contribution of livestock CH4 emissions are only to be exacerbated as the global demand for meat and dairy products increases. Greater than 75% of livestock CH4 emissions are generated in dispersed production environments (e.g., cow-calf and stocker segments), which are not addressable by methane mitigation strategies requiring constant inputs. Thus, strategies that fit into standard agronomic practices, in particular dispersed production environments, are urgently needed to address the increasing carbon footprint associated with livestock production. Methane-reducing vaccines are a promising solution for addressing this need, due to their longevity of action, low cost, and ease of integration into standard agronomic practices, which could lower the barrier for adoption. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effects of a prototype vaccine on total and antigen-specific immune response, CH4 yield, and average daily gain (ADG) in cattle. Angus crossbred steers [n = 20; initial body weight (BW) = 537 ± 15 kg) fed on a high-forage diet were randomly assigned to either placebo- or vaccine-treated groups blocked by BW, breed, and feed intake. Steers were subcutaneously inoculated (2 mL dose) in the anterior region of the neck. Blood and saliva samples were collected, and total sera and salivary immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were quantified using ELISA (Bethyl laboratories, Montgomery, TX). Antigen-specific sera IgG was measured using ELISA. Daily CH4 emissions and dry matter intake (DMI) were measured using GreenFeed systems (C-Lock Inc. Rapid City, SD) and GrowSafe feed bunks (Vytelle, Lenexa, KS), respectively. Body weights were recorded bi-weekly. Total sera IgA and IgG did not differ between the placebo-treated and vaccinated steers (P = 0.584 and P = 0.425, respectively), nor did total salivary IgA and IgG (P = 0.577 and P = 0.548, respectively). However, antigen-specific sera IgG did significantly increase following booster vaccination in the vaccinated steers, as compared with placebo-treated steers (d 0 vs. d 28; P &lt; 0.001). CH4 yield was significantly reduced in vaccinated steers following booster vaccination despite significantly increasing in placebo-treated steers over the same period (P = 0.002). This reduction in CH4 yield was not associated with a reduction in DMI nor ADG (P = 0.181 and P = 0.314, respectively), suggesting that vaccination did not negatively affect treated animals. These findings underscore the potential of vaccine-based solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of livestock CH4 emissions, especially from dispersed production environments where current options for mitigation strategies are limited.

The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of hydrogen injection on the performance of a mini turbo reactor. To achieve this, an experimental test bench was constructed, incorporating a specially designed mini turbo reactor capable of operating on various fuel mixtures and a dry cell electrolyzer for on-site hydrogen production. A comprehensive testing campaign was conducted, comparing the mini turbo reactor performance when fueled with pure propane and a propane-hydrogen blend at varying concentrations. Parameters evaluated included power output, thermal efficiency, fuel mass flow rate, flame temperatures, and pollutant emissions (CO, CO2, NOx). The experimental results unequivocally demonstrated that the addition of hydrogen to propane significantly enhances the mini turbo reactor specific power while concurrently reducing CO and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, data analysis revealed an improvement in the thermal efficiency of the cycle, suggesting potential reductions in specific fuel consumption. These findings highlight the promising potential of hydrogen injection as a strategy to enhance the performance and environmental impact of mini turbo reactor.

In 2020, the Covid-19 outbreak led many countries across the globe to introduce lockdowns (LDs) that effectively caused most anthropic activities to either stop completely or be significantly reduced. In Europe, Italy played a pioneeristic role via the early introduction of a strict nationwide LD on March 9th. This study is aimed at evaluating, using both chemical and meteorological data, the environmental response to that occurrence as observed by the Lamezia Terme (LMT) GAW/WMO station in Calabria, Southern Italy. The first 2020 lockdown has therefore been used as a &ldquo;proving ground&rdquo; to assess CO, CO2, CH4, BC, and NOx concentrations in a rather unique context by exploiting the location of LMT in the context of the Mediterranean Basin. In fact, its location on the Tyrrhenian coast of Calabria and local wind circulation both lead to daily cycles where western-seaside winds depleted in anthropogenic pollutants can be easily differentiated from northeastern-continental winds, enriched in anthropogenic outputs. In addition to that, the first Italian LD occurred during the seasonal transition from Winter to Spring and, consequently, Summer, thus providing new insights on emission outputs correlated with seasons. Findings have clearly indicated BC and, in particular, CO as strongly correlated with average daily temperatures, and possibly domestic heating. CO2&rsquo;s reduction during the lockdown and consequent increase in the post-lockdown period, combined with wind data, has allowed to constrain local source of emissions located northeast from LMT. NOx reductions during specific circumstances are consistent with hypotheses from previous research which linked them to rush hour traffic and other forms of transportation emissions. CH4&rsquo;s stable patterns are consistent with livestock, landfills, and other sources assumed to be nearly constant during LD periods.

Abstract Implementing breeding strategies for a more sustainable food system is one of the most pressing topics for livestock industries. Although different species face different challenges, large-scale research projects can pave the way for future opportunities in these key sectors. Herein, we present two examples (dairy and poultry) of how research projects can result in meaningful changes to commercial breeding programs. The first example is an international large-scale dairy project, which will deliver a roadmap for greenhouse gas (GHG) management using genomics and nutrition. The project aims to facilitate a 55% reduction in GHG emissions from Canadian dairy at an estimated value of $338M CAD. This systems-level approach will leverage resources developed through previous and current large-scale projects to produce accurate multi-level emission estimates and identify opportunities to mitigate enteric GHG emissions. The results of this project will provide accurate, reliable, and robust data for industry stakeholders, national policy, and GHG inventories. The second example is a research collaboration with a commercial turkey breeding company that will enable breeding strategies for long-term and sustainable genetic improvement in health traits. This project aims to reduce preslaughter mortality by 5% and condemnations due to myopathies and health issues. This reduction alone is expected to result in 7.5M kg more turkey meat at a value of $19.8M CAD. Furthermore, there is also an expected reduction of 2.3M kg of CO2 equivalent per year for each 1% livability improvement due to production efficiencies and reduced inputs wasted for more sustainable and ethical meat production. Overall, ongoing and future research initiatives will continue to deliver solutions for key Canadian livestock sectors to improve animal health and welfare as well as efficiency and sustainability. The strides made in these ongoing collaborative projects are imperative for enhancing the sustainability of animal agriculture to feed the growing population.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Light commercial vehicles are an indispensable element for the transport of people and the delivery of goods, especially on extra-urban and long-distance routes. With a view to sustainable mobility, it is necessary to think about hybridizing these vehicles to reduce the fuel consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter. These types of vehicles are generally powered by diesel and travel many kilometers a day. On the other hand, the use of light commercial vehicles in battery electric vehicle (BEV) configuration has already been started but is not receiving widespread recognition. In this panorama, starting from a study already developed for the hybridization of a plug-in light commercial vehicle in Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) condition, the simulation analysis has been extended to the plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) operating in real driving emission conditions (RDE). In particular, using Advisor software, a vehicle has been simulated in different plug-in hybrid configurations. The software has been validated with real operation data of a euro 6 diesel engine. The general hypothesis underlying the research consists in the possibility of using these vehicles in totally electric mode in the city and in hybrid mode outside urban centers; with the aim of reducing polluting emissions in populated city but completing the delivery mission during all phases of vehicle operation. The PHEV simulations have been performed on both WLTC and RDE condition. In the latter mode, particular attention has been devoted to the interpretation of data from GPS sensor: like the slope of the route or the presence of tunnels. The success of the simulation depends on a correct and careful reconstruction of the GPS data. Three vehicles with different hybridization factors have been simulated: 0.44, 0.56, and 0.67, respectively, with power equal to that of the base vehicle. The battery packs have been sized for the three hybrid vehicles and simulations were carried out in both Charge Depleting and Charge Sustaining configuration. In charge depleting for the highest hybrid configuration (HF=0.66), the results demonstrate that a reduction of up to 80% and 76% in fuel can be saved While a reduction up to 75% and 45% in NOx emissions can be achieved on WLTC and RDE cycle, respectively. On the other hand, when the battery is discharged, for HF=0.67, although consumption can be reduced by up to 45%, NOx emissions also increase by 183% even if ICE operation mode has to be better optimize for hybrid operation. Finally, even if the hybrid solutions is really convenient if compared to the conventional vehicle in terms of fuel savings and NOx pollutant emissions, about a realistic estimation of the CO2 reduction that can be achieved the use of electrical energy must be take into account.</div></div>

Abstract The capacity of a novel consensus bacterial 6-phytase variant (PhyG) to maintain growth performance and production benefits of pigs when added to an energy and nutrient-reduced mixed cereal diet was assessed. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1 (wean to finish), weaned pigs [n = 192; initial body weight (BW) 7.18 ± 0.38 kg] were randomized to 4 treatments from weaning until market weight. Diets were provided in 5 phases. Treatments included: 1) a nutritionally sufficient positive control (PC); 2) a negative control (NC1) without added inorganic phosphate, reduced (based on specific PhyG dose) in net energy (NE), calcium (Ca), digestible amino acids (AA) and sodium (Na) vs. PC, supplemented with PhyG at 1,000, 1,000, 750, 500 and 500 FTU/kg in each phase, respectively (NC1+low PhyG); 3) a negative control (NC2) as NC1 supplemented with PhyG at 2,000, 2,000, 1,000, 750 and 750 FTU/kg in each phase and further reduced in energy and nutrient based on specific PhyG dose (NC2+high PhyG), and; 4) a negative control (NC3) as 2) and supplemented with xylanase–β-glucanase (XB) to provide 2,400 U/kg xylanase and 304 U/kg β-glucanase, with additional reduction in NE and digestible AA based on the contribution of XB (NC3+low PhyG + XB). In Exp. 2 (nursery), weaned pigs (n = 360; initial BW 8.40 ± 0.78 kg) were assigned to 3 dietary treatments from weaning up to 35 d. Diets were offered in 2 phases. Treatments included a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC) and 2 PhyG-supplemented diets, reduced in digestible phosphorus, Ca, Na, NE and digestible AA vs. PC, according to the expected contribution of PhyG added at 1,000 FTU/kg (NC1) or 2,000 FTU/kg (NC2), respectively. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Means separation was by Tukey’s HSD test. In Exp. 1, overall growth performance (114 d) in all enzyme-supplemented diets was maintained or improved compared with PC. Compared with PC, feed cost per kg BW gain was significantly reduced by 7.3% and total carbon footprint (CFP; CO2 eq. g/kg BW gain) was reduced by 6.8% with PhyG + XB combination. In Exp.2, overall growth performance (35 d), in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient-reduced, treatments, were either not different from, or were improved, vs. PC. Total feed costs and estimated CFP per kg BW gain were reduced in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient- and NE-reduced treatments vs. PC. In conclusion, the application of a full energy and nutrient matrix maintained the overall growth of pigs in both 114- and 35-d studies with the novel phytase. The addition of XB further improved the overall growth of market pigs. Moreover, full matrix application with PhyG achieved reductions in total feed cost and carbon footprint in both studies.

Abstract Reducing methane (CH4) emissions from beef cattle is desirable as CH4 is a greenhouse gas that represents an energetic loss from the production system. Limestone is commonly fed to cattle as a source of calcium but may also act as a rumen buffer and decrease CH4 emissions by limiting hydrogen availability for methanogenesis. The objective of this experiment was to determine if diet limestone concentration influences growth performance, gas flux, and carcass characteristics in finishing beef cattle. Yearling steers [n = 16; initial body weight (BW) 619 ± 34 kg] were stratified by BW and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 isocaloric and isonitrogenous dietary treatments in a completely randomized design where limestone was included at 1.3% (1X) or 2.6% (2X) of diet dry matter (DM). Finishing diets were formulated to contain 0.43 or 0.96% DM as Ca and were fed ad libitum using automated cattle feeders (SmartFeed Pro; C-Lock Inc.; Rapid City, SD) in a single pen for the final 37 d of finishing. Body weights were measured on d -1, 0, 36, and 37. An automated head chamber system (GreenFeed; C-Lock Inc.) was used to measure gas flux. Analysis of variance was conducted using JMP Pro 17 to determine the fixed effect of treatment with individual animal as the experimental unit. Statistical significance was defined as P ≤ 0.05 with a tendency defined as 0.05 &lt; P ≤ 0.10. Increasing the dietary limestone concentration from 1.3 to 2.6% of DM did not influence DM intake, but numerically increased final shrunk BW (P = 0.68) and hot carcass weight (P = 0.75) and increased average daily gain (ADG; P = 0.02) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) by approximately 12%. Cattle fed the 2X diet tended to have 6.5% greater ribeye area (P = 0.09), but similar USDA yield grade, backfat thickness, and dressing percentage (P ≥ 0.34) when compared with cattle fed the 1X diet. Daily CO2 and CH4 emissions, daily O2 consumption, CH4 yield, and respiratory quotient were unaffected by treatment (P ≥ 0.47). The improvement in ADG resulted in a tendency for CH4 emission intensity to be decreased by 9.1% (P = 0.09) when the concentration of limestone was 2.6% of dietary DM. While increasing dietary limestone concentration from 1.3 to 2.6% of diet DM did not influence absolute daily CH4 emissions, it increased ADG through an improvement in feed efficiency, which translated to a tendency for a reduction in CH4 emission intensity. These preliminary data suggest that there may be a benefit to feeding limestone or calcium at levels greater than currently recommended by the NASEM (2016). Future research should focus on determining optimum dietary limestone or calcium levels for finishing cattle.
