Urea electrosynthesis has appeared to meet the nitrogen cycle and carbon neutrality with energy-saving features. Copper can co-electrocatalyze among CO2 and nitrogen species to generate urea, however developing effective electrocatalysts is still an obstacle. Here, we developed a nitrogen-doped porous carbon loaded with FeCu clusters that convert CO2 and NO3− into urea, with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 39.8 % and yield rate of 1024.6 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, under optimized ambient conditions, exceeding that at the Fe or Cu homogeneous sites. Furthermore, a favorable CN coupling pathway originates from *NHCO and *NHCONO two intermediates with lower free energy barriers on FeCu dual active sites are verified through in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. This research might provide deep insights into coupling mechanisms and investigation of efficient catalysts for green urea production.

Abstract CO2 capture and transformation into chemical fuels presents a useful carbon-neutral energy source to curb the effects of global warming if the electrocatalyst used is highly active, exhibits sufficient product selectivity, and is energetically efficient. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising class of catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and their product selectivity can be further improved through surface modification with different ligands. The primary objective of this work is to compare the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and cyclic voltammetry with a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) to study CO2 reduction at silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) modified with amino acids (cysteine and tryptophan) and Ag NPs synthesized by a citrate reduction method. RRDE studies showed the onset potential for CO2RR was earlier for both the Ag NPs with cysteine and Ag NPs with tryptophan than those with citrate. SECM showed earlier onset potentials for CO2RR than the RRDE experiment for every type of Ag NP as well as the formation of different CO2RR products. SECM also showed less hydrogen formation for the Ag NPs with cysteine and Ag NPs with tryptophan. Comparing RRDE and SECM, SECM appears more sensitive for detecting products of CO2RR.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has recently attracted increasing attention of chemists for converting CO2 to value‐added chemicals with the assistance of electrical energy. Over the past decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to CO2RR, however, this process still suffers the challenges of low conversion and poor selectivity to target product due to the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2. Among those catalysts, Cu has been widely used for CO2RR to produce hydrocarbons with relatively high efficiency in spite of the poor selectivity to products. Therefore, it is highly desired to developed highly active and selective Cu based catalysts for CO2RR. This mini‐review will summary the recent advances on CO2RR over Cu‐based nanocrystals (NCs) with a special focus on the control of selectivity of product via surface modification. We hope this mini‐review will motivate chemists to develop efficient catalysts for CO2RR, and also promote the fundamental research on catalyst design in heterogeneous catalysis.

Elucidating the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions helps promote the coordinated and synergistic development of the economy and the environment. This study utilizes the Tapio decoupling model to analyze the decoupling relationship between economic growth rate and CO2 emissions in 14 cities of Liaoning Province from 2005 to 2020. Additionally, a model is established with the aim of determining CO2 reduction targets for achieving strong or weak decoupling states. Results showed that although most cities showed a strong or weak decoupling state, the decoupling performance in specific year was not ideal, the proportion of negative decoupling increased from 2017 to 2020. Liaoning Province faces significant challenges in decoupling economic growth rate from CO2 emissions, it needs to reduce its CO2 emissions (CE) by 5659.33 107 Kg or 5397.80 107 Kg to achieve strong or weak decoupling, respectively. Among the 14 cities, 8 cities have not achieved strong or weak decoupling. Cities such as Anshan, Yingkou, and Benxi face the greatest challenges, with a minimum required reduction of 25.72% in CE, 41.77% in Carbon Emissions per Capita, and 16.62% in Carbon Emissions per Unit of GDP. The research results can provide theoretical support for improving energy efficiency.

In this work, gold-photo-catalyzed CO2 transformation was conducted and the effect of three variables with two levels was investigated: support (TiO2 and hydroxyapatite from bovine bone (BB)), Au content (5 and 10%) and activation wavelength (254 and 380–700 nm). Reactions were conducted in a stirred tank reactor by bubbling CO2 (9 × 10−3 dm3/min) in 0.1 dm3 of 0.5 M NaOH solution. The catalysts were synthesized using AuCl3, TiO2 and BB. Au nanoparticles were obtained by reduction with Hetheroteca inuloides, thus eliminating calcination and hydrogenation to reduce the gold species. By TEM, the particle size distribution was determined, and the synthesized nanoparticle sizes varied in the range of 9 to 19 nm, depending on the support and Au content. By UV–Vis spectroscopy, the energy band gaps of the prepared materials were 2.18 eV (10% Au/BB), 2.38 eV (5% Au/BB), 2.42 eV (BB), 3.39 eV (5% Au/TiO2), 3.41 eV (10% Au/TiO2) and 3.43 eV for pure TiO2. Methanol and formic and acetic acids were identified during the process. Selectivity toward methanol was found to be improved with the 10% Au/BB catalytic system.

Abstract Visible-light activation of photocatalysts is crucial for effectively utilizing solar energy in molecular conversions. This study demonstrates that modifying the bipyridine ligand with carbazole enables visible-light activation of a Ru(II) carbonyl complex catalyst, which is originally developed as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction but inactive as a photocatalyst on its own. The present study opens avenues for individually designing light-absorbing ligands and catalytic functions within one mononuclear complex.

Ruthenium CNC pincer complexes, comprised of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and a pyridyl ring, are highly active catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. We hypothesized that the addition of long chain aliphatic groups with an olefin terminus as wingtips on these CNC pincers could be used to form macrocyclic catalysts by ring closing metathesis (RCM). We have synthesized three new ruthenium pincer catalysts, [(CNC)Ru(CH3CN)2Cl]OTf, containing a long chain olefin wingtip (4A-4C, where R = H, Me, OMe para to N on the pyridine ring) and performed RCM on 4B, followed by hydrogenation, to form a novel macrocyclic ruthenium catalyst, 6B. These four catalysts were tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in the presence (sensitized) and absence (self-sensitized) of an external photosensitizer. With a photosensitizer, these catalysts produced mostly CO (775 to 1210 TON) with smaller amounts of H2 also formed. The methyl substituted macrocyclic catalyst 6B showed a TON of 1185 for CO over 72 hours compared to a TON of 775 for CO for the acyclic catalyst 4B. The remote substituents at the para-position of the central pyridine ring significantly influence catalyst activity with R = OMe > H = Me.

Abstract. Wildfires release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change and causing severe impacts on air quality and human health. Including carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wildfires in international assessments and national emission reduction responsibilities is crucial for global carbon reduction and environmental governance. In this study, based on a bottom-up approach and using satellite data, combined with emission factor and aboveground biomass data for different vegetation cover types (forest, shrub, grassland, cropland), the dynamic changes in CO2 emissions from wildfires in China from 2001 to 2022 were analyzed. The results showed that between 2001 and 2022, the total CO2 emissions from wildfires in China were 693.7 Tg (1 Tg = 1012 g), with an annual average of 31.5 Tg. The CO2 emissions from cropland and forest fires were relatively high, accounting for 46 % and 32 %, respectively. The yearly variation in CO2 emissions from forest and shrub fires showed a significant downward trend, while emissions from grassland fires remained relatively stable. In contrast, the CO2 emissions from cropland fires showed a clear upward trend. High CO2 emissions from wildfires were mainly concentrated in the eastern regions of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia Provinces in China, accounting for 44 % of the total annual emissions. Various factors such as daily cumulative sunshine hours (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, forest: -0.41, shrub:0.25; p < 0.001) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; Spearman’s correlation coefficient, forest: -0.35, shrub: 0.37; p < 0.001), influenced CO2 emissions from forest and shrub fires. Moreover, temperature (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.45, p < 0.001) primarily affected CO2 emissions from grassland fires. The CO2 emissions from cropland fires negatively correlated with the gross domestic product (GDP) (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.52, p < 0.001) and population density (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.51, p < 0.001). China's policy management has been crucial in reducing CO2 emissions from wildfires. By accurately assessing CO2 emissions from wildfires, governments worldwide can better set CO2 reduction targets, take corresponding measures, and contribute to the global response to climate change.

Air pollution is a critical issue impacting urban environments, leading to severe health problems and environmental degradation. This comprehensive review examines the potential of green systems—specifically green walls, active green walls, and urban greenery systems—to mitigate atmospheric pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon dioxide (CO2). By systematically analyzing 44 recent studies, the review highlights the pollutant capture efficiency of various green technologies and plant species in both indoor and outdoor settings. Active green walls, particularly those utilizing plant species such as Chlorophytum comosum and Sansevieria trifasciata, were found to be highly effective, with VOC reduction efficiencies up to 96.34%, PM reductions by 65.42%, and CO2 reduction rates reaching 4.8% under optimal conditions. The review identifies key strengths in current research, including diverse experimental setups and the use of sophisticated measurement techniques, but also notes significant limitations such as variability in experimental conditions and a lack of long-term performance data. The study underscores the importance of proper maintenance to sustain green systems&#039; efficacy and highlights the potential issue of pollutant resuspension, which remains under-researched. Practical implications for urban planning are discussed, advocating for the integration of effective green systems into urban infrastructure to enhance air quality and public health. Recommendations for future research include the need for standardized metrics, long-term studies, economic feasibility analyses, and real-world validation of simulation models to better understand and optimize green systems for urban air pollution mitigation.

The need to reduce vehicle emissions has encouraged the development of various solutions. One of them is the steam injection method, which proved to be an effective option of reducing NOx emissions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the steam injection method on an agricultural engine, appropriate tests were carried out at the Alternative Fuels Research Laboratory of the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. The engine KDI 1903M and a self-made steam device ensuring steam injection in the intake manifold were used in the tests. The research engine was connected to the SIERRA CP-Engineering engine test bench. Additionally, emissions were recorded by the AVL SESAM FTIR exhaust gas analytical system. Testing was performed without steam supply and with steam supply at constant speeds, as well as in different load modes - 10 kW and 20 kW. The results showed that the largest reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions was obtained at idling (7.5%), while in case of all load modes the results were very similar (reduction by 4.1-5.0%). At the same time, increase of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions was observed in all testing modes by 3.0-5.6%, while carbon dioxide (CO2) changes were negligible. The studies confirmed an insignificant increase in the power and torque. The results prove that further research should increase the volume of steam supply by improving the given device.

Abstract This study examines the geospatial locations of energy stations within Port-Harcourt Aba expressway to ascertain their locations if it conforms to standard practice. It also took into cognizance the in-situ monitoring of the various air pollutants within the vicinity of the energy stations. The study location is in Obio/Akpor and Port Harcourt city Local Government Area, Rivers State. The result of the proximity analysis reveals that the energy stations do not fall within the standard of 15metres specified by DPR (Department of Petroleum Resources). The various pollutants examined are PM 10, PM 2.5, carbon monoxide (Co), Nitrogen Dioxide (No2), ground level ozone (O3), and sulphur dioxide (S02). The result reveals that their concentrations values fall within the permissible limit as specified by NESREA except (C02) which is the primary pollutant was extremely highly than the permissible limit of 400 (ppm). This can be attributed to the influx of vehicles that buys fuel from the energy stations. The concentration of (C02) poses a serious health effect on the pump attendants due to their constant inhaling of the pollutants. The study concludes that energy stations should be cited at the approved DPR standard of (15metres) and actionable measures should be put in place to aid in the reduction of CO2 within the energy stations. Finally, the study recommends that there should be strict compliance to DPR standard in the siting of energy stations.

Abstract Cement manufacture is a significant source of carbon dioxide (Co2) emissions in the building sector. Thus reduction in carbon footprint is need of the day which can be achieved through use of high volume flyash (HVFA) concrete mix which helps in reducing the cement demand in the concrete mix. HVFA mixes offers better life cycle assessment than the conventional Portland cement concrete mix (OPC). In this study, concrete mix of grade M30 to M70 with OPC mix without flyash was compared with the HVFA mix which had 40% and 50%flyash replacement. The mechanical behaviour such as compressive strength in HVFA mix was less as compared with pure OPC mix on an average by 4 MPA also the rapid chloride penetration (RCPT) was found less than when compared with pure OPC mix for all grades of concrete. For M30 grade of concrete the RCPT values were 1412 coulomb which was less as compared with OPC mix, while the RCPT values with HVFA mix for M35, M40 M45, M50, M60 and M70 was 1412 coulomb, 1317 coulomb, 1056 coulomb, 1182 coulomb, 990 coulomb, 870 coulomb 991 coulomb respectively. When compared to the HVFA mix, the pure OPC mix’s water absorption showed greater values. M30 grade of concrete the water absorption was 31% less than pure OPC. Similarly for M35, M40, M45, M50, M60 and M70 was 12%, 34% 5%, 34%, 38% and 53% respectively. Hence HVFA mix though had strength less than OPC mixes but delivered excellent durability parameters.

Our current research includes treating the toxicity of wastewater using green algae, and this is done through a set of steps that involve withdrawing nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater for algae to benefit from them in their growth, leading to a clear reduction in their concentrations. Since the algae depend on self-feeding for their living so that they carry out the process of photosynthesis, they thus consume carbon dioxide that is produced from the process of decomposing organic carbon in wastewater by the action of bacteria that work on consuming the oxygen liberated from the algae during the process of photosynthesis, and this leads to reducing carbon dioxide emissions on the one hand and reduces the requirements for ventilation necessary for the work of bacteria on the other hand. Quantitative analysis illustrates that 1.83 grams of carbon dioxide are consumed for every gram of algal biomass. This study highlights the effectiveness of algae as a sustainable and green method for treating wastewater.

Summary Mixing of incompatible injection and formation brines leads to the deposition of inorganic sulfate scales such as barite, celestite, and anhydrite in and around production wells. This process is well documented in seawater-flooded clastic reservoirs. One technique to avoid the resulting formation damage is to remove sulfate from seawater before injection using nanofiltration; however, this process is costly. We identify in this paper that it may not always be necessary in higher-temperature carbonate reservoirs. In this paper, we describe the use of reactive transport reservoir simulation to investigate the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) partitioning and changes in pH, ionic concentrations, and temperature on carbonate reactivity and the sulfate scaling risk in waterflooded carbonate reservoirs. Dissolution and precipitation of calcite, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, barite, and celestite are all modeled and found to be coupled through (various) common ion effects. The produced brine compositions are used to calculate the saturation ratios (SRs) and mass of precipitate that may form in the production system. Sensitivity to mineral reaction kinetics, particularly for the dolomite reactions, is accounted for. Results identify that there is a strong relationship between calcite dissolution and dolomite (or other calcium/magnesium carbonate mineral) precipitation reactions, which drive each other and are affected by the availability of CO2 in the residual oil phase. This evolves over time, and as the thermal front propagates, impacts the concentration of calcium and magnesium in the brines traversing the reservoir. Temperature changes around the injection wellbore impact CO2 and mineral solubilities. The concentration of calcium in the displaced brine mix is thus determined more by contact with rock and temperature than by mixing between injection and formation brines. Depending on location relative to the thermal front, this may lead to gypsum or anhydrite precipitation, thereby stripping sulfate out of the injection brine. Thus, the sulfate scaling risk at the production wells is significantly reduced by this sulfate depletion process: The sulfate is stripped out of the seawater as it warms up in the reservoir before it mixes extensively with the formation water and significantly before any mixture of the two brines reaches the production zone. Thus, any loss of permeability is restricted to deep within the reservoir, where the pore volume (PV) that can accommodate mineral precipitation is very large. In this work, we identify that for carbonate reservoirs above 90–100°C, stripping of sulfate due to coupled mineral reactions may reduce or eliminate the need for use of a sulfate reduction plant (SRP). The process is modeled for the first time, accounting for the impact of CO2 partitioning and thermal front propagation. Knowledge of the kinetics of calcium/magnesium carbonate precipitation is shown to be critical in predicting the extent of sulfate depletion.

Abstract It is now widely recognized that net zero by 2050 transition cannot be achieved without major reductions in carbon emissions from the building and the related infrastructure development sector including both from building operations and from carbon embedded in construction materials. Collectively the construction and operation of buildings are one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Reductions need to occur quickly since buildings constructed today will likely still be in service well beyond 2070 and most existing buildings will remain in service in 2050. Transitioning to net zero buildings are also likely to have a significant impact on several areas of natural resources law including land use, construction and infrastructure development law, energy security, environment, zoning, procurement, and energy solidarity. This chapter focuses on the legal and policy challenges in pursuing net zero buildings strategies that can dramatically reduce the role of buildings in climate change.

Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) devices are increasingly used in treating acute-on-chronic respiratory failure caused by chronic lung diseases. There are no large studies that investigated safety, efficacy, and the independent association of prognostic variables to survival that could define the role of ECCO2R devices in such patients. This multicenter, multinational, retrospective study investigated the efficacy, safety of a single ECCO2R device (Hemolung) in patients with acute on chronic respiratory failure and identified variables independently associated with intensive care unit (ICU) survival. The primary outcome was improvement in blood gasses with the use of Hemolung. Secondary outcomes included reduction in tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, survival to ICU discharge, and complication profile. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify variables that are independently associated with ICU survival. A total of 62 patients were included. There was a significant improvement in pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) along with a reduction in respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation with Hemolung therapy. The complication profile did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariable analysis identified the duration of Hemolung therapy to be independently associated with survival to ICU discharge (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.040-1.518; p = 0.01).

Scenarios to stabilize global climate and meet international climate agreements require rapid reductions in human carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, often augmented by substantial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. While some ocean-based removal techniques show potential promise as part of a broader CDR and decarbonization portfolio, no marine approach is ready yet for deployment at scale because of gaps in both scientific and engineering knowledge. Marine CDR spans a wide range of biotic and abiotic methods, with both common and technique-specific limitations. Further targeted research is needed on CDR efficacy, permanence, and additionality as well as on robust validation methods—measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification—that are essential to demonstrate the safe removal and long-term storage of CO 2 . Engineering studies are needed on constraints including scalability, costs, resource inputs, energy demands, and technical readiness. Research on possible co-benefits, ocean acidification effects, environmental and social impacts, and governance is also required.

Abstract The Aeolian archipelago is known worldwide for its volcanic activity and hydrothermal emissions, of mainly carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide are minor components of these emissions which together can feed large quantities of bacteria and archaea that do contribute to the removal of these notorious greenhouse gases. Here we analyzed the metagenome of samples taken from the Levante bay on Vulcano Island, Italy. Using a gene-centric approach, the hydrothermal vent community appeared to be dominated by Proteobacteria , and Sulfurimonas was the most abundant genus. Metabolic reconstructions highlight a prominent role of formaldehyde oxidation and the reverse TCA cycle in carbon fixation. [NiFe]-hydrogenases seemed to constitute the preferred strategy to oxidize H 2 , indicating that besides H 2 S, H 2 could be an essential electron donor in this system. Moreover, the sulfur cycle analysis showed a high abundance and diversity of sulfate reduction genes underpinning the H 2 S production. This study covers the diversity and metabolic potential of the microbial soil community in Levante bay and adds to our understanding of the biogeochemistry of volcanic ecosystems.

Air pollution is the condition of air that is contaminated by the presence of materials, substances or polluting components. One of the causes of air pollution is the combustion or inseneration process because the residue of the process can be released into the air. Based on ISPU, there are five main pollutants, namely: carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), surface ozone (O3), and dust particles (PM10). This study was conducted to reduce the emission of gases. The use of modified cyclone with adsorbent pipe tube from cocoa husk can increase the efficiency of combustion results with adsorption pipe tube modified cyclone. From the results of the study it was found that emissions from incineration can be controlled with APPU in the form of a cyclone. The use of cyclone alone can reduce NOX and CO levels with a reduction in NOX emissions to 53% and CO to 96%. Both emission reductions are in line with the quality standards. However, the use of adsorption pipe tubes showed better efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract High‐entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted significant attention for electrocatalytic energy conversion by virtue of their promisingly high efficiency, stability, and low cost. Recently, encouraging progress has been made in tuning the structure and composition of HEAs used in electrolyzers and fuel cells. However, the understanding on the synthetic methods and the structure‐property‐performance relationship of well‐defined HEAs nanostructures is still inadequate. To gain insight into the future research directions on HEAs for electrocatalysis, in this paper, the synthetic methods commonly used to obtain well‐defined HEAs nanostructures (0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets/nanoplates, 3D nanoporous structures, and other three‐dimensional morphologies) are first summarized. Then, the authors discuss the application of well‐defined HEAs nanostructures in several typical electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and formic acid oxidation reaction. Finally, a practical perspective on the future research directions on well‐defined HEAs nanostructured electrocatalysts is provided.

Abstract Escalations in economic development and the concomitant upsurge in social globalization (SG) in the largest economies have enhanced the utilization of fossil fuels, which in turn has stimulated carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Given that reducing global warming is one of the essential means to disrupt climate change and attain sustainable development, this study examines the interlinkages between SG, energy transition (ENTR), international tourism (ITU), and CO 2 emissions. As environmental issues are widespread in the largest economies, this investigation analyzed the data from the 10 largest economies using the Method of Moments Quantiles Regression (MM‐QR) from 1995 to 2020. The study found that ENTR plays a significant role in decreasing emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. Alongside this, increasing social globalization also curbs CO 2 emissions and facilitates environmental sustainability. Apart from this, the findings demonstrate a progressively increasing contribution of ITU and economic growth to enhancing environmental degradation. Furthermore, results indicated that carbon emissions are not influenced by reductions in political risks in the member nations. Finally, policies to support environmental sustainability are discussed.    

    

## Kinetic Investigation on Solvating Alkylamine Hofmann Elimination over Brønsted Acidic Zeolites

The presence of solvents can significantly alter the reaction kinetics of catalytic conversions, yet the mechanisms of the solvent effect remain widely debated and could greatly vary between different chemistries. We use vapor phase Hofmann elimination of tert-butylamine (TBA) to systematically investigate how solvents participate catalyzed reaction over Brønsted acid sites of solid acid catalysts and affect a catalytic cycle. Twenty commonly used organic and inorganic solvents were tested to investigate the relationship between solvent identity and their influence on reaction kinetics. Kinetic measurements showed a significant and reversible inhibition in rates of Hofmann elimination in the presence of every tested solvent, with the degrees of reduction vary from less than 10% for non-polar solvents (carbon dioxide, benzene, hexane) to more than 90 % (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, acetonitrile), which was found to exhibit a roughly linear against the molecular dipole moment of solvents. Additionally, the degree of reduction is not affected by the size of molecule as the carbon chain length increases, but is negatively related to the degree of substitution by alkyl group on the α-carbon as well as halogen atom on the β-carbon. Despite the significant kinetic inhibition and a 30 kJ mol-1 increase in the measured apparent activation energies, the temperature programmed surface reaction profiles performed with pre-adsorbed TBA with feeding of acetonitrile and methanol showed no change in the peak temperature from the catalyst without solvent feed. Cooperative adsorption complex formed between the surface tert-butylammonium and solvent molecule adsorbed on a neighboring framework oxygen, which is far less reactive towards Hofmann elimination, is proposed to be responsible for the observed rate inhibition. Also, the stability of adsorption complex formation is found to be affected by the proton affinity of solvent, as revealed by the kinetic modeling of experimental rate measurements.

As the imperative to address climate change becomes more pressing, there is an increasing focus on limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 °C by the century's end relative to 1990 levels. This compels economy-wide transformations in energy infrastructure, land use, and sustainability policies. During the recent Conference of Parties (COP28), nations committed to tripling renewable energy generation to a minimum of 11,000 GW by 2030 and increasing the global annual energy efficiency from 2 % to 4 % annually until 2030. Additionally, the Food and Agricultural Organization introduced a roadmap to transition the Agri-food system from a net emitter to a carbon sink. The role of carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) has become crucial in achieving climate targets, especially in the context of achieving net zero emissions by mid-century and removing residual emissions post-mid-century. This paper assesses the impact of these policies on emissions, energy structure, land use, and global warming temperature. The findings indicate that implementing the COP28 pledges and FAO roadmap leads to a warming temperature of 2 °C, falling short of the ambitious 1.5 °C temperature limit. Likewise, we see that shutting down fossil plants drives significant emissions and temperature reduction even without novel CDRs. The modeled result shows that Agricultural soil carbon and biochar contribute 47-58 % share of the total CDR deployed in the scenario. In conclusion, CDRs can expedite climate goals but must complement emission reduction efforts; hence, the transition away from fossil fuels should prompt the development of detailed roadmaps. Also, Also, more global efforts should be placed on nature-based CDR methods, as they offer diverse co-benefits.

Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing air pollution represent two pressing and interwoven environmental challenges. While international carbon markets, such as the European Union emissions trading system (EU ETS), have demonstrated their effectiveness in curbing carbon emissions (CO    2   ), their indirect impact on hazardous co-pollutants remains understudied. This study investigates how key toxic air pollutants—sulfur dioxide (SO    2   ), fine particulate matter (PM     2.5    ), and nitrogen oxides (NO    x   )—evolved after the introduction of the EU ETS with a comparative analysis of regulated and unregulated sectors. Leveraging the generalized synthetic control method, we offer an ex post analysis of how the EU ETS and concurrent emission standards may have jointly generated sizable pollution reductions in regulated sectors between 2005 and 2021. We provide an aggregate assessment that these pollution reductions could translate into large health co-benefits, potentially in the hundreds of billions of Euros, even when bounding the effect of emission standards. These order-of-magnitude estimates underscore key implications for policy appraisal and motivate further microlevel research around the health co-benefits of carbon abatement.

A three-dimensional (3-D) physical-biogeochemical-carbon cycle coupled model is used to investigate the interannual variability of the air-sea carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) flux ( F CO 2 ) in the Northern Yellow Sea (NYS) from 2009 to 2018. The verification of the model indicate that the simulation results for multiple variables exhibit consistency and fit well with the observed data. The study show that although the multi-year average F CO 2 in the NYS is close to the source-sink balance, there are obvious interannual differences between different years. In particular, a relatively strong source of atmospheric CO 2 (1.0 mmol m –2 d –1 ) is exhibited in 2014, while a relatively strong sink of atmospheric CO 2 (–0.7 mmol m –2 d –1 ) emerges in 2016. Mechanism analysis indicates that the abnormally high temperature is the main controlling factor for the relatively high CO 2 efflux rate in the NYS in 2014, while the abnormally low dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration is the main factor contributing to the relatively high CO 2 influx rate in 2016. Further analysis reveals that the primary reason for the low DIC concentration since the onset of winter in 2016 is the high net decrease rate of DIC in the NYS in 2015, influenced by net community production in the summer and advection processes during the autumn. The abnormally high primary production during the summer of 2015 results in the excessive reduction of DIC concentration through biological processes. In addition, due to the strong northeasterly wind event in November 2015, low-concentration-DIC water from the Yellow Sea (YS) extends into the Bohai Sea (BS). This further leads to higher DIC flux from the NYS into the BS in the upper mixed layer and increases the inflow of low-concentration-DIC water from the Southern Yellow Sea (SYS) into the NYS. These ultimately result in the abnormal reduction of DIC concentration in the upper mixed layer of the NYS during the autumn of 2015. This study enriches our understanding of interannual variability of F CO 2 in the NYS, which will not only help to further reveal the variations of F CO 2 under human activities and climate change, but also provide useful information for guiding the comprehensive assessment of the carbon budget.

Summary The change in wettability of limestone reservoirs from oil-wet toward gas-wet can enhance crude oil production during immiscible CO2 injection. Therefore, in this research, we investigated the impact of wettability alteration to CO2-wet on oil recovery factor via dissolution of fluorine-free, CO2-philic, nonionic surfactants such as C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 in CO2. Based on the cloudpoint measurements, the dissolution pressures of nonionic surfactants in supercritical CO2 ranged between 2,100 psi and 2,700 psi (below the reservoir pressure, i.e., 3,000 psi) at reservoir temperature, 65°C; these pressures are commensurate with CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pressures. Also, the C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 can reduce the CO2-oil interfacial tension (IFT). Moreover, the CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solutions can change the limestone wettability from strongly oil-wet (Θ ~ 20o) to intermediate CO2/oil-wet (Θ = 95o and 110o) at reservoir conditions. The relative permeability curves also confirmed it by changing the curvature to the left and decreasing the residual oil saturation in both cases of CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solutions. The 20.8% and 13.1% additional oil recoveries were achieved during the 30,000 ppm CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solution scenarios, respectively, relative to the pure CO2 injection scenario. These nonionic surfactants are not able to make CO2-in-oil foam; therefore, wettability alteration and perhaps IFT reduction are the dominant mechanisms of EOR induced by the dissolution of nonionic surfactants in CO2, instead of CO2 mobility control. Consequently, the dissolution of fluorine-free, oxygenated, CO2-philic, nonionic surfactants (such as C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19) in CO2 at 30,000 ppm concentration can be a well-qualified candidate for altering the limestone wettability to intermediate CO2-oil-wet during the immiscible CO2 injection.

Vegetables are the high valued crops for human kind as it is rich source of important vitamins and minerals especially, micronutrients and phytochemicals promote good health which helps in reduction of mal nutrition. It is also primarily responsible for the positive health effects due to contains generous amount of numerous antioxidant substances, carotenoids and phenolics. Farmers are favored for their economics due to the short period of cultivation. But due to world's biggest threat that is climate change, which has made vegetable cultivation vulnerable to extreme weather occurrences including high temperatures, unpredictable rainfall that causes flooding, and drought situations. Vegetables are very perishable in nature due to high water content i. e., 90%. Therefore, high temperature makes the cell damage and vulnerable for carry out all physiological and biological process inside the cell. Shedding down of flower bud and small fruit of solanaceous, cucurbitaceous and other types of vegetables also occur under high temperature stress. Not only drought, high temperature causes the cell damage but also erratic rainfall pattern results flood condition also dangerous for crop growth and development. In flooded condition, tomato plants produced ethylene hormone which is detrimental for fruit quality due to absence of oxygen. Increases in carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and other harmful gases as a result of human activity are the primary cause of climate change. The majority of carbon dioxide is produced by burning of fossil fuels with emission of harmful industrial gases, methane is produced by raising livestock, and nitrous oxide is produced by using inorganic fertilizer. According to FAO, worlds vegetable production is get lowered around 18.68% due to adverse climatic effect. As a result, by 2050, an estimated 175 million more people could have zinc deficiency and 122 million more could have protein deficiency. People in poverty, who rely primarily on plant sources for sustenance, will be most affected by these effects. Therefore, to mitigate climate change problem crop prototype or idiotype will be helpful in a 328significant manner. Climate change is not only responsible for abiotic stresses but also it is responsible for spreading of biotic stress. So, incorporation of new crop prototype or new cultivar in a farming system which are resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses along with rich in high nutrition content. Climate change is not only a potential for the future; it is a reality that we are all already experiencing. Therefore, in modern farming systems modified and new innovation technology regarding water, soil and food security can be helpful to cope up in the climate change issue.

Abstract Incorporating reprocessing, recycling, and sustainable processes and materials is essential for a circular economy. Reprocessing and recycling are related since both help minimize wastage and produce a sustainable regenerative economy. However, polymers might undergo degradation depending on the recycling process, reducing their lifespan. In this study, polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) undergoes repetitive reprocessing under varied temperatures, times, and shear rates to investigate the evolution of mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. Furthermore, foaming experiments are conducted using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 ) on reprocessed samples to examine changes in the properties and morphology of the foam. The significance of reprocessing PBAT is divided into environmental, temperature, and processing effects. Environmental conditions impact the results where no oxidation effects are noticed in the 2‐hour test, while 7 days of humidity exposure lead to a tenfold reduction in polymer viscosity. Different processing techniques reduce the molecular weight of PBAT and alter its polydispersity. Specifically, the number average molecular weight ( M n ) decreases from an initial 53 to 37 kDa after processes like extrusion or mixing. However, elongation at break and ultimate strength of PBAT remain unchanged after high‐shear extrusion processing. Additionally, PBAT foam morphology evolves over 5 cycles, leading to smaller pores and reducing compressive modulus.

Incorporating outstanding flame retardancy and electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) into polymers is a pressing requirement for practical utilization. In this study, we first employed the principles of microencapsulation and electrostatic interaction-driven self-assembly to encapsulate polyethyleneimine (PEI) molecules and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets on the surface of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), forming a double-layer-encapsulated structure of ammonium polyphosphate (APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx). Subsequently, flame-retardant thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites were fabricated by melting the flame-retardant agent with TPU. Afterwards, by using air-assisted thermocompression technology, we combined a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film with flame-retardant TPU composites to fabricate hierarchical TPU/APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx/rGO composites. We systematically studied the combustion behavior, flame retardancy, and smoke-suppression performance of these composite materials, as well as the flame-retardant mechanism of the expansion system. The results indicated a significant improvement in the interface interaction between APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx and the TPU matrix. Compared to pure TPU, the TPU/10APP@PEI@1TC composite exhibited reductions of 84.1%, 43.2%, 62.4%, and 85.2% in peak heat release rate, total heat release, total smoke release, and total carbon dioxide yield, respectively. The averaged EMI SE of hierarchical TPU/5APP@PEI@1TC/rGO also reached 15.53 dB in the X-band.

This study proposes an IoT architecture for monitoring emissions of polluting gases in vehicles, in response to the growing concern about air pollution and global warming. The architecture is based on a node equipped with DHT22, MQ9, and MQ135 sensors to capture temperature, humidity, and gas emissions, respectively. This node effectively communicates through the LTE network to send the data to the ThingSpeak platform. An analysis of CO2, CO, and CH4 pollution levels is conducted using the collected data. These data are validated through the technical review of a test vehicle. Subsequently, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained using a specific database of CO2 emissions from vehicles in Canada. As a result, a high R2 of 99.2% is achieved, along with low values of RMSE and MSE, indicating that the model is making accurate predictions and fits well to the training data. The ANN aims to predict CO2 emissions and verify CO2 data from the IoT network. The architecture demonstrates its capability for real-time monitoring and its potential to contribute to pollution reduction.

Through photosynthesis, forests absorb annually large amounts of atmospheric CO2. However, they also release CO2 back through respiration. These two, opposite in sign, large fluxes determine how much of the carbon is stored or released back into the atmosphere. The mean seasonal cycle (MSC) is an interesting metric that associates phenology and carbon (C) partitioning/allocation analysis within forest stands. Here, we applied the 3D-CMCC-FEM model and analyzed its capability to represent the main C-fluxes, by validating the model against observed data, questioning if the sink/source mean seasonality is influenced under two scenarios of climate change, in five contrasting European forest sites. We found the model has, under current climate conditions, robust predictive abilities in estimating NEE. Model results also predict a consistent reduction in the forest’s capabilities to act as a C-sink under climate change and stand-aging at all sites. Such a reduction is predicted despite the number of annual days as a C-sink in evergreen forests increasing over the years, indicating a consistent downward trend. Similarly, deciduous forests, despite maintaining a relatively stable number of C-sink days throughout the year and over the century, show a reduction in their overall annual C-sink capacity. Overall, both types of forests at all sites show a consistent reduction in their future mitigating potential.

Despite of Indonesia’s vast solar energy potential according to the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesia’s total installed capacity of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) is very far from Indonesia’s target of 3.6 GW in 2025. Indonesia once applied net metering scheme for rooftop solar PV policy and was expected to be able to boost rooftop solar PV growth. A system dynamics approach is used in the research to develop an assessment model to evaluate the policies’ impact on residential rooftop solar PV system growth. A Causal Loop Diagram was established then transformed into Stock and Flow Diagram (SFD) using software Vensim PLE 10.1.3, which was used to simulate several policies’ scenarios related to residential rooftop solar PV adoption and CO2 emissions reduction. Ten scenarios were simulated in this study involving three groups of intervention: initial net metering tariff, reduction on initial solar PV cost, upper limit of ROI, and combination of initial net metering tariff and initial solar PV cost reduction. The simulations revealed that combination of increasing net metering tariff to 80% & initial cost reduction 30% has the highest potential solar PV installations, the highest CO2 emissions reduction, and the lowest accumulation cost of net metering in 2030. This study can be used as reference by the policy makers in Indonesia to formulate the optimum policy to boost rooftop solar PV growth as the simulations shows that residential rooftop solar PV with the right intervention can meet the government’s target of rooftop solar PV in 2030.

Background United States (U.S.) school meal programs serve billions of meals annually; however, little is known about their environmental impacts.Objective This study estimated the daily greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), water scarcity footprint (WSF), and food cost associated with the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) Programs and modeled the association of food substitutions and food waste reduction.Design A cross-sectional analysis of day-1 dietary intake in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2011-2018.Participants/Setting Participants included 796 children and adolescents from pre-Kindergarten to grade 12 who consumed breakfast or lunch on a weekday from a school cafeteria that met the minimum standard for an eligible meal. Main outcome measures The main outcomes were per capita nutrient intake, GHGE, WSF, and food cost.Statistical analyses performed Differences in mean impacts and between baseline and two modeled scenarios (food substitutions, food waste reductions) were evaluated using paired Wald tests.Results Daily per capita GHGE, WSF, and food cost for school food programs (NSLP + SBP) was 1.69 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) (95% CI: 1.55-1.84 kg CO2eq), 10.23 L eq×102 (9.20-11.27 L eq×102), and USD $3.70 ($3.39-4.00), respectively. Dairy (mainly cow’s milk) and protein foods (mainly beef) were the largest contributors to GHGE. Fruit was the largest contributor to the WSF. Modeled food substitutions significantly reduced GHGE by 14-25% and WSF by 11-14% for the school meal programs. There were mixed effects on food cost (-2% to 6% change) and nutrient intake. Modeled food waste reductions of 5% were associated with a 1% decrease in GHGE, WSF, and food costs.Conclusions The NSLP and SBP are critical to child nutrition, and food substitution and food waste reduction strategies can lower their environmental footprint with manageable impacts on nutrition quality.

Regulating the binding effect between the surface of an electrode material and reaction intermediates is essential in highly efficient CO2 electro‐reduction to produce high‐value multicarbon (C2+) compounds. Theoretical study reveals that lattice tensile strain in single‐component Cu catalysts can reduce the dipole–dipole repulsion between *CO intermediates and promotes *OH adsorption, and the high *CO and *OH coverage decreases the energy barrier for C–C coupling. In this work, Cu catalysts with varying lattice tensile strain were fabricated by electro‐reducing CuO precursors with different crystallinity, without adding any extra components. The as‐prepared single‐component Cu catalysts were used for CO2 electro‐reduction, and it is discovered that the lattice tensile strain in Cu could enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products effectively. Especially, the as‐prepared CuTPA catalyst with high lattice tensile strain achieves a FEC2+ of 90.9% at −1.25 V vs. RHE with a partial current density of 486.1 mA cm−2.

This study investigates the impact of various auxiliary cooling techniques on machinability, energy consumption, carbon emissions, and economic factors in the drilling process of AA7075T6 aluminium alloy using TiO2 and C-reinforced composites. The study employed various cooling conditions (dry, MQL, CO2, and hybrid MQL+CO2), with different cutting speeds and feed rates, to evaluate their effects on drilling characteristics. The findings indicated that the combined MQL and CO2 cooling notably enhanced the drilling process by reducing cutting forces by 32% and surface roughness by 65% compared to dry cutting. This synergy between lubrication and cooling significantly improves machinability, resulting in higher-quality machining outputs with smoother surfaces and more precise circularity. Energy analysis revealed that the MQL+CO2 method reduces energy consumption to 64% observed under dry conditions, underscoring its efficiency through better heat dissipation and reduced friction. Furthermore, this method demonstrates a significant reduction in carbon emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability. Economically, although initial costs associated with the implementation of cooling systems are higher, they are offset by reduced tool wear and energy costs, making it a viable solution for sustainable manufacturing practices.

Abstract Background and Aims Long-term exposure over several days to Far-Red (FR) increases leaf expansion, while short-term exposure (minutes) may enhance the PSII operating efficiency (ϕPSII). The interaction between these responses at different time scales, and their impact on photosynthesis at whole-plant level is not well understood. Our study aimed to assess the effects of FR in an irradiance mimicking the spectrum of sunlight (referred to as artificial solar irradiance) both in the long and short-term, on whole-plant CO2 assimilation rates and in leaves at different positions in the plant. Methods Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants were grown under artificial solar irradiance conditions with either a severely reduced or normal fraction of FR (SUN(FR-) vs. SUN). To elucidate the interplay between the growth light treatment and the short-term reduction of FR, we investigated this interaction at both the whole-plant and leaf level. At whole-plant level, CO2 assimilation rates were assessed under artificial solar irradiance with a normal and a reduced fraction of FR. At the leaf level, the effects of removal and presence of FR (0FR and 60FR) during transition from high to low light on CO2 assimilation rates and chlorophyll fluorescence were evaluated in upper and lower leaves. Key Results SUN(FR-) plants had lower leaf area, shorter stems, and darker leaves than SUN plants. While reducing FR during growth did not affect whole-plant photosynthesis under high light intensity, it had a negative impact at low light intensity. Short-term FR removal reduced both plant and leaf CO2 assimilation rates, but only at low light intensity and irrespective of the growth light treatment and leaf position. Interestingly, the kinetics of ϕPSII from high to low light were accelerated by 60FR, with a larger effect in lower leaves of SUN than in SUN(FR-) plants. Conclusions Growing plants with a reduced amount of FR light lowers whole-plant CO2 assimilation rates at low light intensity through reduced leaf area, despite maintaining similar leaf-level CO2 assimilation to leaves grown with a normal amount of FR. The short-term removal of FR brings about significant but marginal reductions in photosynthetic efficiency at the leaf level, regardless of the long-term growth light treatment.

The LDR-50 low-temperature nuclear reactor is designed for the Finnish and European district heating markets, as an environmentally sustainable heating option for the 2030s. While the carbon footprint of conventional electricity-producing reactors is known to be small, there have been no comprehensive studies on the emission reduction potential when the technology is applied to the heating sector. This paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis. The carbon footprint of the LDR-50 heating plant is evaluated, and compared to conventional heating fuels, direct electric heating, and heat pumps. The results of the analysis show that the life cycle CO2 emissions are low, although there are still significant uncertainties related to the construction phase, due to missing data. In addition to carbon footprint, the analysis is also extended to other adverse environmental impacts. It is concluded that significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved by replacing fossil heating fuels with nuclear energy. The technology is considered a viable option alongside biofuels and heat pumps. The overall environmental impacts are low, and the production does not compete for low-carbon electricity or scarce natural resources.

Abstract The ability of high-temperature solid oxide cell (SOC) electrochemical reactors to efficiently convert atmospheric carbon to high value chemicals for industrial and energy storage applications via CO2 and co-electrolysis makes them a key technology for active carbon utilisation. However, due to additional operational risks from thermochemical reactions on thermal management, limited experimental capacity, and relative novelty, CO2 and co-electrolysis lag behind steam electrolysis in large-scale adoption. Here, a 1D+1D SOC model based on fundamental first principles considering three-dimensional heat transfer was improved via a unique method for representing co-electrolysis electrochemistry, solving with low computational effort. Validation against experimental data for two compositions and pressures, showed high levels of accuracy with respect to characteristic cell voltages, temperatures, and outlet compositions. The model also showed CO2 reduction during co-electrolysis mainly occurred via reverse water gas shift, while CO2 electrolysis still accounted for up to 35% of the total share. Pressurised co-electrolysis operation promotes exothermic methanation, causing pronounced heating of the reactor, consequently reducing the isothermal current density. Therefore, low to moderate pressurisation is likely most suited for coupling with downstream synthesis processes to avoid the installation of unnecessarily large systems and associated high costs.

_ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 214950, “Limitations and Fallacies of Carbon Capture and Storage and Impact on Oil and Gas Production,” by S.M. Farouq Ali, SPE, and Mohamed Y. Soliman, SPE, University of Houston. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ In the complete paper, the authors write that, while carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives are affecting oil and gas operations profoundly, such efforts have had little perceptible effect on atmospheric CO2, which continues to increase. The paper aims to show that current CCS regimens have serious technical and fiscal constraints and questionable validity, stating that, globally, CCS has not increased beyond approximately 0.1% of global CO2 emissions in the past 20 years. The paper offers partial solutions and concludes that, while oil and gas will continue to be important energy sources beyond the foreseeable future, oil companies will accomplish the needed CCS. Introduction The authors write that, while CCS efforts have been pursued for 4 decades, little has been achieved. For the past 20 years, the percentage of CO2 captured and stored is less than 0.1% of the CO2 emitted worldwide, if one considers CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects to be CSS—which, the authors write, is a fallacy. They emphasize that CCS means injection with no production. The key to CCS success, they write, is major governmental subsidization, by whatever terminology it is known, and that means taxpayer money. Sweeping decisions that have a profound effect on oil and gas production and petroleum engineering education are being made based on predictions of an increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in various time frames. Magnitude of the Problem The problem of world CO2 emissions capture is gigantic. To appreciate the magnitude of the problem, imagine that 1 year’s CO2 emissions (40 billion tonnes) are captured, compressed and liquified, and injected into a reservoir the size of the Ghawar oil field, the largest reservoir in the world, with the entire pore space (approximately 0.5 Tcf) available for storage. In this hypothetical, nine such reservoirs would be required every year. Presumably, such storage space can be found, but collecting the CO2 and bringing it to a storage site is a highly complex task. For example, in a sequestration effort in a building complex in New York, the CO2 is separated, liquified, and trucked to a storage site to be injected underground, which is impractical. Often, the example of the Nordic countries (mainly Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) is cited as evidence of successful emissions reduction. But the total population of these countries is approximately the same as that of metropolitan Mumbai in India. Definitions Carbon capture use and storage (CCUS) implies that the CO2 produced by various processes is captured and used for EOR. This accounts for approximately 30% of the 230 mtpa of CO2 captured globally. CCS means that any CO2 produced by the process is captured and injected into a suitable geological formation for storage for thousands of years. Net-zero emissions (NZE) implies that all the CO2 produced is captured and stored. In Canada, “absolute zero emissions” is discussed, meaning that no CO2 is produced in the first place, pointing to total fossil-fuel phaseout.

Background: Stretch marks, or striae distensae (SD), are a common dermatological issue caused by skin stretching and subsequent dermal damage. Various treatments, including laser therapy and microneedling, have been explored for SD. This study evaluates and compares the effectiveness of Fractional CO2 laser and microneedling with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for treating SD. Method: A randomized controlled trial was conducted over a year at Rohilkhand Medical College and Hospital. Ninety-eight patients aged 18-40 were enrolled and divided into two groups: Group A (Fractional CO2 laser) and Group B (microneedling with PRP), each receiving four sessions at three-week intervals. Patients' histories, including demographics and striae characteristics, were documented. The effectiveness of treatments was assessed using the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS) at multiple follow-ups. Side effects were also recorded. Result: Group A (Fractional CO2 laser) had 49 patients with a mean age of 25.9 years, and Group B (microneedling with PRP) had 49 patients with a mean age of 26.4 years. Group A showed a significant reduction in striae width and length compared to Group B. By Week 12, 48.80% of Group A reported Excellent Improvement in VAS scores, compared to 12.80% in Group B. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in Group A, with more patients reporting Very Satisfied and Extremely Satisfied outcomes. Side effects such as erythema and hyperpigmentation were more common in Group A. Conclusion: Fractional CO2 laser therapy is more effective than micro needling with PRP in reducing the appearance of stretch marks, with higher patient satisfaction and significant improvements in VAS scores. Despite a higher incidence of side effects, the CO2 laser provides better overall outcomes.

Waste-to-energy systems can provide a functional demonstration of the economic and environmental benefits of circularity, innovation, and reimagining existing systems. This study offers a robust quantification of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential of the adoption of anaerobic digestion (AD) technology on applicable large-scale dairy farms in the contiguous United States. GHG reduction estimates were developed through a robust life cycle modeling framework paired with sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Twenty dairy configurations were modeled to capture important differences in housing and manure management practices, applicable AD technologies, regional climates, storage cleanout schedules, and methods of land application. Monte Carlo results for the 90% confidence interval illustrate the potential for AD adoption to reduce GHG emissions from the large-scale dairy industry by 2.45–3.52 MMT of CO2-eq per year considering biogas use only in renewable natural gas programs and as much as 4.53–6.46 MMT of CO2-eq per year with combined heat and power as an additional biogas use case. At the farm level, AD technology may reduce GHG emissions from manure management systems by 58.1–79.8% depending on the region. Discussion focuses on regional differences in GHG emissions from manure management strategies and the challenges and opportunities surrounding AD adoption.    

    

## Oxygen Species Involved in Complete Oxidation of CH4 by SrFeO3-δ in Chemical Looping Reforming of Methane

Compared with conventional methane reforming technologies, chemical looping reforming (CLR) has the advantages of self-elimination of coke, a suitable syngas ratio for certain down-stream processes, and a pure H2 or CO stream. In the reduction step of CLR, methane combustion has to be inhibited, which could be achieved by designing appropriate oxygen carriers and/or optimizing the operating conditions. To gain a further understanding of the combustion reaction, methane oxidation by perovskite (SrFeO3-δ) at 900 °C and 1 atm in a pulse mode was investigated in this work. The oxygen non-stoichiometry of SrFeO3-δ prepared by a Pechini-type polymerizable complex method is 0.14 at ambient conditions, and it increases to 0.25 and subsequently to 0.5 when heating from 100 to 900 °C in argon that contains 2 ppmv of molecular oxygen. The activation energies of the first and second transitions are 294 and 177 kJ/mol, respectively. The presence of 0.99 vol.% hydrogen in argon significantly reduces the amount CO2 produced. At a pulse interval of 10 min, the amount of CO2 produced in the absence of hydrogen is one order of magnitude greater than that in the presence of hydrogen. In the former case, the amount of CO2 produced dramatically decreases first and then gradually approaches a constant, and the oxygen species involved in methane combustion can be partially replenished by extending the pulse interval, e.g., 82.5% of this type of oxygen species is replenished when the pulse interval is extended to 60 min. The restored species predominantly originate from those that reside in the surface layer or even in the bulk.

A long period of deposit development leads to a reduction in the volume of balance reserves of ores, while the volume of accumulation of waste (tailings) from mining and processing production increases. In connection with this, an urgent problem is the processing of waste tailings, which can serve as an additional source of commercial products of non-ferrous metals. The set objectives can be achieved by implementing comprehensive extraction of valuable components, reducing fuel, and energy costs at the stage of low-temperature sintering to produce white soot (grade BS-100). In order to determine the amount of heat of chemical reactions during sintering of rough copper concentrate with sodium hydroxide, thermochemical calculations were carried out. For the research, we used rough copper concentrate with a copper content of 4.40% and silver of 77.03 g/t. An equation has been obtained for calculating the heat of chemical reactions of rough concentrate sintering. According to this equation, the greatest contribution to the heat release is provided by the iron content (60%), three times less and equally (19%) - copper and silicon and about 0.2% is absorbed by aluminum. The thermal effect of sintering will be -920.45 kW·h/t of concentrate. From the heat balance of sintering it follows that with an alkali consumption of up to 200% of the mass of the concentrate. The heat of chemical reactions will be sufficient for the autogeneity of the process. Research has been carried out on sintering the concentrate with alkali in the temperature range of 250-500 °C and obtaining white soot from a productive leaching solution with the extraction of 60% silicon. White soot (mSiO2·nH2O) was isolated by two-stage carbonization of a silicate solution with carbon dioxide in a recirculation system with further washing of the precipitate with a solution of sulfuric acid.

As part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and lower its negative effects on climate change, this study was conceived with the aim of evaluating the rate of reduction of greenhouse gases emission from diesel engine powered with Jatropha Curcas seed oil blend diesel. The study produced biodiesel from the oil extracted from the Jatrophha Curcas seed using trans-esterification method. The amount of CO2, SO2 and NO2 emitted from a diesel engine powered with conventional oil and jatropha biodiesel blend were determined to ascertain whether there was reduction or increment in percentage of emissions. Laboratory analysis of Jatropha Curcas oil shows that 131.9524g jatropha curcas seed yielded 90.559ml of biodiesel and 41.2437ml of glycerol. Conventional diesel and Jatropha curcas biodiesel produced has similar physiochemical characteristics confirmed through ASTM(US) and DIN(EN) hence their combustibility. CO2 emissions increased with increase in diesel at B100 and B50 while it decreases in B20 and B40. While NO2 emissions increased by 1% in all the revolutions per minute, SO2 was only detected at B100 and B50 emission of the greenhouse gases. From the questionnaire survey conducted at Egbema, it was found that gas flaring has serious adverse effect on vegetation in the area, significant negative effect on the economy of the area due to the rise in air pollution. The result of the laboratory experiments showed that blended green diesel reduces the emission of greenhouse gases from combustion of diesel. The study recommended adoption of renewable energy sources for the operation of the oil firms in Egbema the study therefore concluded that blended green diesel is a promising alternative fuel for internal combustion engines.

Abstract. Earth system model experiments presented here explore how the centennial response in the Southern Ocean can drive ongoing global warming even with zero CO2 emissions and declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These projections were simulated by the earth system model version of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS-ESM1.5) and motivated by the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP); ACCESS-ESM1.5 simulated ongoing warming in the ZECMIP experiment that switched or branched to zero emissions after 2000 PgC had been emitted. New experiments presented here each simulated 300 years and included intermediate branch points. In each experiment that branched after emitting more than 1000 PgC, the global climate continues to warm. For the experiment that branched after 2000 PgC, or after 3.5 °C of warming from a preindustrial climate, there is 0.37 ± 0.08 °C of extra warming after 50 years of zero emissions, which increases to 0.83 ± 0.08 °C after 200 years. All branches show ongoing Southern Ocean warming. The circulation of the Southern Ocean is modified early in the warming climate, which contributes to changes in the distribution of both physical and biogeochemical subsurface ocean tracers, such as ongoing warming at intermediate depths and a reduction in deep oxygen south of 60° S. A simple slab model emulates the global temperatures of the ACCESS-ESM1.5 experiments demonstrating the response here is primarily due to the slow response of the ocean and the Southern Ocean in particular. Centennial global warming persists when the slab model is forced with CO2 diagnosed from late-branching experiments with other ZECMIP models, confirming the dominant role of ocean physics at these timescales. However, decadal responses changed due to the larger drawdown of CO2 from other models. Slow ongoing warming in the Southern Ocean can be found in ZEC scenarios of most models, though the amplitude and global influence varies.

In the present investigation, Cu2O-based composites were successfully prepared through a multistep method where cubic Cu2O nanoparticles (CU Cu2O) have been grown on Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) nanosheets. The structural and morphological properties of the materials have been studied through a comprehensive characterization, confirming the coexistence of crystalline Cu2O and RGO. Microscopical imaging revealed the intimate contact between the two materials, affecting the size and the distribution of Cu2O nanoparticles on the support. The features of the improved morphology strongly affected the electrochemical behavior of the composites, increasing the activity and the faradaic efficiencies towards the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction process. CU Cu2O/RGO 2:1 composite displayed selective CO formation over H2, with higher currents compared to pristine Cu2O (−0.34 mA/cm2 for Cu2O and −0.64 mA/cm2 for CU Cu2O/RGO 2:1 at the voltage of −0.8 vs. RHE and in a CO2 atmosphere) and a faradaic efficiency of 50% at −0.9 V vs. RHE. This composition exhibited significantly higher CO production compared to the pristine materials, indicating a favorable *CO intermediate pathway even at lower voltages. The systematic investigation on the effects of nanostructuration on composition, morphology and catalytic behavior is a valuable solution for the formation of effective interphases for the promotion of catalytic properties providing crucial insights for future catalysts design and applications.

Marine sources of omega-3, proteins, and other nutrients are in increasing demand, while supply is struggling to meet this demand increase. A key focus for meeting the need for marine ingredients for human and animal nutrition is ensuring sustainable sourcing for both the oceans as well as other production types. Aker BioMarine is harvesting and producing marine ingredients from krill and this communication is intended to showcase how the harvesting and production of such ingredients are performed in a sustainable way. This communication is written to describe the krill fisheries’ management, to provide demonstration cases from CO2 hot spotting, and show how results from these are used to target GHG emission reduction. The initiatives that are taken to ensure sustainable fishing and production, as well as examples of short- and long-term actions to reduce and minimize the impact of all activities, are provided.

Bio-carbon–manganese composites obtained from olive mill wastewater were successfully prepared using manganese acetate as the manganese source and olive wastewater as the carbon precursor. The samples were characterized chemically and texturally by N2 and CO2 adsorption at 77 K and 273 K, respectively, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction. Electrochemical characterization was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The samples were evaluated in the electro-Fenton degradation of tetracycline in a typical three-electrode system under natural conditions of pH and temperature (6.5 and 25 °C). The results show that the catalysts have a high catalytic power capable of degrading tetracycline (about 70%) by a three-electron oxygen reduction pathway in which hydroxyl radicals are generated in situ, thus eliminating the need for two catalysts (ORR and Fenton).    

    

## Comments: Pore Space Leasing: Insights From a Bakken Surface Owner’s Perspective   

OpenAlex: https://openalex.org/W4400193771    
Open access: False
    
[Pam Boschee](https://openalex.org/A5069367188), Journal of petroleum technology. 76(07)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.2118/0724-0008-jpt.
    
During a trip to western North Dakota last month to visit my family, I met with a long-time friend, Dick, who holds subsurface mineral rights and surface rights in the Bakken area. Over coffee, German sausage, and kuchen, our conversation naturally turned to the leasing of pore space. Dick has lately been approached by landmen with what they describe as “great deals” for purchasing the underlying pore space associated with his surface rights. They hesitate to provide specific offers. Instead, he described the initial interactions as “like making a deal for a new car or tractor.” The landmen reply, “I’ll need to go back to the client [my boss or manager] with your questions.” Sound familiar? Like most US states, pore space ownership correlates with surface ownership in North Dakota. In August 2022, the North Dakota Supreme Court clarified the rights of surface owners and the need for compensation for pore space use. It also created uncertainty for oil and gas operators who previously had more latitude in using pore space without compensation. Dick knows his way around the dealmaking involved in oil and gas rights leasing, having been involved in many landmen inquiries in the days of the Bakken boom and subsequent wheeling and dealing. However, pore space leasing is relatively nascent and faces similar unknowns like the early days of Bakken pitches. During his research, he came up against the same walls I have over the years while writing about pore space leasing for carbon sequestration. Becoming more apparent as deals gain momentum is the lack of specifics for comparable deals. As when purchasing a home, identifying “comps” for similar properties is a necessary part of the process. But the amounts paid for pore space are closely held, generally not publicly available. It’s impossible to determine if a deal is good or bad. Is the compensation fair? And individual surface owners and landowners rights associations (and/or their attorneys) are aware of the 45Q tax credit of $85/tonne of CO2 captured and stored available to the project developer/operator under the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. How should this be factored into the determination of fair compensation? For example, the Ohio River Valley Institute (ORVI), a think tank focused on the Appalachian region, in March described a proposal by Tenaska Inc. to lease underground pore space across seven counties (approximately 80,000 acres) in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia for the sequestering of 150 million tons of CO2. In a document proposing terms for the acquisition of nearly 1,400 acres of pore space in county parklands in Washington County, Pennsylvania, Tenaska offered about $4 million for the county’s 2.6-million-metric-ton share of the CO2 between 2027 and 2056, or about $1.50 per metric ton. The ORVI called the deal “ridiculous and borderline insulting.” It supports this declaration by highlighting a comp available from August 2023. Mountaineer GigaSystem LLC offered the state of West Virginia a royalty of $3.35 per metric ton to sequester CO2 on public land in Mason County—more than two times what Tenaska is offering Washington County. It also made the point that the ultimate cost of capturing and sequestering the CO2 will not be borne by Tenaska or its customers. The 45Q tax credit will provide Tenaska $423 million annually for sequestering 5 million tons of CO2 annually. The region’s lease revenue will be $7.5 million. To align with the available comp, ORVI said Tenaska’s offer should at least match Mountaineer’s $3.35 instead of the proposed $1.50 per metric ton. In the western US, ExxonMobil is seeking to pay the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to inject 150 million tons of CO2 over the course of 20 years into 100,000 subsurface acres of pore space on federal lands. The proposed Snowy River CO2 project in Carter County, Montana, is still in the environmental assessment and public comment phase, and the BLM’s compensation for the use of the land is not yet publicly disclosed or finalized. Our takeaway after finishing the sausage and kuchen? As pore space leasing evolves, landowners like Dick face a complex landscape of uncertain deals and opaque compensation. With legal clarifications and potential tax credits in play, navigating these new frontiers requires keen insight and vigilance to ensure fair and beneficial agreements for all involved.

High-performance machine components are involved in a wide range of industrial production processes. They play an important role in the provision of chemical products, pharmaceuticals, and energy resources. They require monitoring because they can fail during production due to corrosion and/or wear, which often means an increased risk to people and the environment. Periodic inspections with on-site test personnel often require a shutdown of the chemical plant. Ideally, an ultrasonic structural health monitoring (SHM) system could be used to provide continuous data on the structural integrity of these components while reducing or eliminating plant downtime. A plant shutdown is not only a high economic or supply risk but can also be energy intensive. In our presentation, we would like to give an overview of the technical requirements for an SHM system to be used in the chemical industry. Finally, the presentation will highlight the economic benefits of SHM as well as its contribution to energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of chemical product produced.

This study critically examines the impact of indoor air quality (IAQ) on occupant health in two critical care units (ICUs) at Jason Sendwe Hospital (JSH) and General Carrier de Mine Hospital (GCMH) within the Southern DRC metropolitan area, focusing on their impact on occupant health and well-being. Utilizing a mixed methods approach that includes health questionnaires, continuous environmental monitoring (monitoring CO2, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, and relative humidity), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, this research aims to identify correlations between environmental factors and the health of hospital staff and patients. The investigation was conducted across both the rainy and dry seasons, revealing significant seasonal variations in IEQ parameters and exploring the incidence of symptoms commonly associated with sick building syndrome among hospital staff. Higher CO2, VOCs, and particulate matter levels during the dry season indicated the inadequacy of current ventilation strategies to maintain optimal air quality. This study proposes the implementation of air filtration and purification systems and the refurbishment of natural ventilation systems as effective measures to improve IAQ. Additionally, alternative ventilation strategies, including occupancy reduction and the integration of supply and exhaust ventilation, were explored to address the challenges of inadequate ventilation. The findings reveal the urgent need for hospitals to adopt ventilation strategies that ensure the health and well-being of occupants, highlighting the importance of continuous IAQ monitoring, community engagement, and the integration of advanced ventilation technologies in healthcare settings. This comprehensive exploration offers valuable insights for improving ventilation in ICUs, contributing to creating healthier indoor environments in hospital settings, especially in regions facing unique environmental challenges.

The reduction of fossil fuels which produce CO2 emission that damage the environment, can be done by implementing renewable energy-based power generations, such as solar and wind. This research designs a hybrid energy system by optimizing the use of existing diesel generators through the integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic and micro wind turbine, and is equipped with an energy storage system. This research uses HOMER Pro software to determine the optimal capacity of hybrid system components, and to calculate the cost of energy (CoE). Furthermore, the hybrid system configuration is analyzed by applying several objectives. The objectives of the hybrid system design are to prioritize a maximum renewable energy penetration ratio within permitted annual capacity shortage and with the CoE lower than the existing CoE. The research results show that the proposed hybrid energy system can provide a renewable energy penetration ratio of 57.1% with CoE of IDR 3,510/kWh.

Abstract The advent of digital health technologies has transformed the landscape of healthcare delivery and sustainable practice, with dermatology being no exception. National Health Service (NHS) England reported carbon emissions of 27.1 million tonnes from the health and social care system in 2017, equating to 6.3% of England’s emissions [NHS England. Delivering a ‘net zero’ National Health Service. Available at: https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf (last accessed 19 March 2024)]. Subsequently, the initiation of the NHS campaign ‘For a Greener NHS’ was introduced to ensure stakeholders are mindful of their healthcare delivery. This project delves into the sustainability implications of transitioning from traditional paper-based patient information leaflets (PILs) to online platforms within the field of dermatology. Focusing on environmental, economic, patient and healthcare delivery perspectives, the project aims to elucidate the benefits and challenges associated with this digital shift. A quality improvement project was used to propose a new lean pathway for educating patients using digital PILs. Quantitative data assessed printing habits from the outpatient department printer over 2 weeks prior to any intervention. Printing habits were reassessed for a further 2 weeks after QR codes to PILs were left in the dermatology clinic rooms and clinicians were encouraged to avoid printing PILs where feasible. Carbon emissions and cost analyses were calculated to quantify the effect of digital PILs. Qualitative data through a survey disseminated to patients and clinicians assessed the impact of digital PILs on healthcare delivery, patient engagement, and information accessibility. The results demonstrated that over the first 2-week period 1723 pages were printed, which equated to 8615g CO2 equivalent. Implementation of the digital PILs resulted in 1596 pages printed, equating to 7980g CO2 equivalent. This equates to 16 510g of CO2 emissions and £317.50 in costs potentially saved annually when switching to digital PILs. This is equivalent to the CO2 emitted by fully charging 2068 smartphones [US Environmental Protection Agency. Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator. 2024. Available at: https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator (last accessed 19 March 2024)]. Preliminary qualitative results illustrated the reluctance of particular age groups to engage in digital PILs due to poor technology literacy. However, there was an awareness among patients and dermatologists to implement sustainable education. Our findings demonstrate that digital PILs foster a reduction in the carbon footprint and costs. The increasing prevalence of smartphones and internet connectivity gives digital platforms the potential to enhance patient education, engagement, and adherence to treatment plans. However, considerations related to digital literacy, accessibility and data security need to be addressed to ensure equitable healthcare delivery. Through a synthesis of environmental, economic and healthcare delivery perspectives, our findings aim to guide healthcare providers in making informed decisions regarding the adoption of digital platforms for sustainable patient information dissemination.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic-assisted radical gastrectomy (LARG) is the standard treatment for early-stage gastric carcinoma (GC). However, the negative impact of this procedure on respiratory function requires the optimized intraoperative management of patients in terms of ventilation. AIM To investigate the influence of pressure-controlled ventilation volume-guaranteed (PCV-VG) and volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) on blood gas analysis and pulmonary ventilation in patients undergoing LARG for GC based on the lung ultrasound score (LUS). METHODS The study included 103 patients with GC undergoing LARG from May 2020 to May 2023, with 52 cases undergoing PCV-VG (research group) and 51 cases undergoing VCV (control group). LUS were recorded at the time of entering the operating room (T0), 20 minutes after anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (T1), 30 minutes after artificial pneumoperitoneum (PP) establishment (T2), and 15 minutes after endotracheal tube removal (T5). For blood gas analysis, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) were observed. Peak airway pressure (Ppeak), plateau pressure (Pplat), mean airway pressure (Pmean), and dynamic pulmonary compliance (Cdyn) were recorded at T1 and T2, 1 hour after PP establishment (T3), and at the end of the operation (T4). Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) were recorded. Pre- and postoperative serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Compared with those at T0, the whole, anterior, lateral, posterior, upper, lower, left, and right lung LUS of the research group were significantly reduced at T1, T2, and T5; in the control group, the LUS of the whole and partial lung regions (posterior, lower, and right lung) decreased significantly at T2, while at T5, the LUS of the whole and some regions (lateral, lower, and left lung) increased significantly. In comparison with the control group, the whole and regional LUS of the research group were reduced at T1, T2, and T5, with an increase in PaO2, decrease in PaCO2, reduction in Ppeak at T1 to T4, increase in Pmean and Cdyn, and decrease in Pplat at T4, all significant. The research group showed a significantly lower incidence of PPCs than the control group within 3 days postoperatively. Postoperative IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α significantly increased in both groups, with even higher levels in the control group. CONCLUSION LUS can indicate intraoperative non-uniformity and postural changes in pulmonary ventilation under PCV-VG and VCV. Under the lung protective ventilation strategy, the PCV-VG mode more significantly improved intraoperative lung ventilation in patients undergoing LARG for GC and reduced lung injury-related cytokine production, thereby alleviating lung injury.

We present an optical study based on the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) approximation, combining structural information taken from density-functional theory (DFT) to elucidate spectral features of CO adsorbed on Pt (111) and Cu (111). Optical information and structural arrangement of the adsorbed CO are correlated by varying both site positions and CO coverage as compared to experimental studies (θ = ¼ to θ = ½). This enables us to resolve key spectral features of both occupied and unoccupied molecular states at various adsorbate coverages, comparing theory to experiment. Using experimental data as benchmarks: we show the theory compares well with available data. Its predictive power provides a new path to infer information about the structure of CO from optical information, and can help to predict the presence of other little understood adsorbates such as an OCCO dimer, that may be relevant to mechanistic pathways for reduction of CO2 to high value C2+ products. This new approach complements total energy calculations, and also fills a void in DFT based theory that is known to be an unreliable predictor of the energetics of CO on transition metal surfaces.

The decentralization of electricity authority in Nigeria has made it expedient for the South-West Geopolitcal Zone to develop strategic power generation infrastructure. This study assessed the techno-economic viability of the liquefied petroleum gas-powered alternative electricity infrastructure option in Southwestern Nigeria as a mitigation strategy to endemic inadequate grid power supply under the region's integrated electric power programmes. An energy project planning and foresight analysis methodology was used. The study showed that a 25 MW stand-alone LPG-based CHP power plant would require 8.567 acres of land, consume approximately 15.459 million kg of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) annually, while generating 210,240 MWh of electricity annually. This power plant initiative was considered to have acceptable risk (Payback Period = 9 years 3 months; Return on Investment = 10.73%) and viability at the minimum tariff of $0.11/kWh. It also had considerable annual CO2 emissions and fuel cost savings (255.75 metric kilotonnes and $137.58 million respectively) relative to diesel-based alternative power generation. The study recommended that the viability of the power plant be improved by reductions in operations costs. The study concluded that the LPG plant initiative was technically feasible, economically viable and environmentally friendly, and suitable for deployment in the study area.

Drought stress is one of the most critical threats to crop productivity and global food security. This review addresses the multiple effects of drought on the process of photosynthesis in major food crops. Affecting both light-dependent and light-independent reactions, drought leads to severe damage to photosystems and blocks the electron transport chain. Plants face a CO2 shortage provoked by stomatal closure, which triggers photorespiration; not only does it reduce carbon fixation efficiency, but it also causes lower overall photosynthetic output. Drought-induced oxidative stress generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage cellular structures, including chloroplasts, further impairing photosynthetic productivity. Plants have evolved a variety of adaptive strategies to alleviate these effects. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanisms help dissipate excess light energy as heat, protecting the photosynthetic apparatus under drought conditions. Alternative electron pathways, such as cyclical electron transmission and chloroplast respiration, maintain energy balance and prevent over-reduction of the electron transport chain. Hormones, especially abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and cytokinin, modulate stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, and osmotic adjustment, further increasing the tolerance to drought. Structural adjustments, such as leaf reordering and altered root architecture, also strengthen tolerance. Understanding these complex interactions and adaptive strategies is essential for developing drought-resistant crop varieties and ensuring agricultural sustainability.

Microbial communities of terrestrial mud volcanoes are involved in aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation, but the biological mechanisms of these processes are still understudied. We have investigated the taxonomic composition, rates of methane oxidation, and metabolic potential of microbial communities in five mud volcanoes of the Taman Peninsula, Russia. Methane oxidation rates measured by the radiotracer technique varied from 2.0 to 460 nmol CH4 cm−3 day−1 in different mud samples. This is the first measurement of high activity of microbial methane oxidation in terrestrial mud volcanos. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has shown that Bacteria accounted for 65–99% of prokaryotic diversity in all samples. The most abundant phyla were Pseudomonadota, Desulfobacterota, and Halobacterota. A total of 32 prokaryotic genera, which include methanotrophs, sulfur or iron reducers, and facultative anaerobes with broad metabolic capabilities, were detected in relative abundance >5%. The most highly represented genus of aerobic methanotrophs was Methyloprofundus reaching 36%. The most numerous group of anaerobic methanotrophs was ANME-2a-b (Ca. Methanocomedenaceae), identified in 60% of the samples and attaining relative abundance of 54%. The analysis of the metagenome-assembled genomes of a community with high methane oxidation rate indicates the importance of CO2 fixation, Fe(III) and nitrate reduction, and sulfide oxidation. This study expands current knowledge on the occurrence, distribution, and activity of microorganisms associated with methane cycle in terrestrial mud volcanoes.

High light (HL) significantly impacts plant photosynthesis. This study investigated the effects of different magnesium (Mg) levels (0, 1, 2, and 5 mol Mg plant⁻1; HMg0, HMg1, HMg2, and HMg5) on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Cuibi No. 1) under HL (1500 μmol m⁻2 s⁻1), aiming to understand the role of Mg in mitigating the impact of HL on photosynthesis and carbon–nitrogen metabolism. Plants treated with 1 mol Mg plant⁻1 under 750 μmol m⁻2 s⁻1 light conditions served as the control. HL led to a reduced chlorophyll (Chl) content and inhibited the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax). It also decreased energy involved in photosynthetic electron transfer (ET) and electron flux to reduction end-electron acceptors at the photosystems I (PSI) acceptor side (RE) and caused photosynthetic system damage. H2O2 accumulation exacerbated membrane lipid peroxidation damage, disrupting carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and inducing antioxidant enzyme activity. HMg2 increased Chl content, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, and the net photosynthetic rate compared to HMg0. It enhanced ET efficiency, PSI and PSII functionality, reduced dissipated energy flux (DI), and minimized photosynthesis damage. Conversely, excessive Mg application (HMg5) decreased Pmax and PSII activity, increasing DI. Adequate Mg supply alleviated HL’s detrimental effects by enhancing Chl content and ET and RE efficiency.

Wind power generation has increased in China to achieve the target of decreasing CO2 emissions by 2050, but there are high levels of wind curtailment due to the mismatch between electricity supply and demand. This paper proposes a single-stage air source heat pump coupled with thermal storage for building heating purposes. The main objective is to find the proper system designs and operating strategy, which can help to avoid peak demand periods while obtaining minimized running costs and reduced wind energy curtailment. Dynamic simulations were performed using TRNSYS to investigate its use in a typical office building based on an actual electricity tariff, wind power, and meteorological data. The proper system designs, including the tank size and thermal storage temperature, were determined to maximize the system’s performance. It was found that a proper combination of the two parameters exists for a specific application. Further, results showed that the use of auxiliary electric heating is necessary for single-stage air source heat pumps to participate in a wind curtailment reduction. The operating strategy of the system was also studied. Results indicate that by implementing a proper operating strategy, non-renewable power consumption can be reduced by 11% for the studied building, with a total wind power utilization of 3348 kWh during the heating season while still satisfying the heating demands of users. These findings can contribute to the green and low-carbon development of the building industry and further enhance the grid’s accommodation capacity for renewable energy sources.

While significant progress has been made in carbon abatement, evidenced in literature produced over the past year, particularly within the realm of carbon capture and storage (CCS), I’d like to invite your attention to three key topics in this discussion. First, despite more than 3 decades of intense focus on emissions issues, highlighted since the 1980s and formalized with the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, global emissions have only increased instead of going down. It’s imperative to question the efficacy, premises, practicality, and overlooked hurdles of current approaches. Paper SPE 214950, summarized here, sheds light on some of these challenges. It emphasizes that implementing costly carbon-abatement methods in a world marked by sharp regional economic disparities with wealth concentrated in a few countries could worsen economic inequalities by making access to energy even less equitable. Additionally, paper SPE 215050 (included in the list for further reading) underscores the priority of energy security over carbon reduction, citing recent evidence from leading proponent nations of climate action resorting to the use of coal. Failing to address energy security and economic disparity, though these are not the only obstacles, could hinder progress toward societal carbon-reduction goals. My second topic for your kind attention is the progress made on the CCS front, on which an overwhelming number of papers (approximately 75% of those reviewed) were presented at SPE conferences last year. An ongoing challenge with CCS, particularly in deep saline aquifers, is the prolonged period required for injected CO2 to chemically react and solidify for permanent storage. Paper SPE 215352, summarized here, introduces a different perspective based on the author’s exposure to another industry: proposing the coinjection of CaCl2 to expedite the permanent storage of CO2, potentially addressing this issue. The third topic that you will find interesting is developments on the hydrogen front, aimed at replacing direct use of fossil fuels as energy vectors. The cost of producing green hydrogen is expected to come down with advancement of technology, at least in some geographical areas, as the second paper shortlisted for further reading, paper IPTC 23652, suggests. One promising application involves using excess solar power during the day to convert hydrogen and store it underground for use when sunlight is unavailable. This could green the so-called peaker plants. While the approach of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) undoubtedly has the advantage of storing large amounts of energy, it may still struggle to compete with utility-scale battery storage in terms of the associated round-trip energy efficiency. There are many technoeconomic challenges to be solved in the hydrogen-based energy approach, including in the UHS context, before it can be used at a significant scale. Despite some previous experience with controlled and small-scale application of UHS, much remains to be learned about its safety and economics. The risks include leakage hazards, underground chemical reactions, loss from residual trapping, and contamination, among others. However, papers like IPTC 23943, one summarized here, along with the third one selected for further reading, paper SPE 215489, underline the necessity and the strides being made by the engineering community in overcoming these technological challenges.

Previous studies have shown feasibility of meeting the US EPA and California Air Resource Board (CARB) requirements. This work includes a 15L diesel engine equipped with cylinder deactivation (CDA) and an aftertreatment system that was fully DAAAC aged to 800,000 miles. The aftertreatment system includes an e-heater (electric heater), light-off Selective Catalytic Reduction (LO-SCR) followed by a primary aftertreatment system containing a DPF and SCR. The e-heater was capable of providing up to 10 kW, however for the purpose of this project, lower power settings of 2.5 kW and 5 kW were studied in combination with CDA for lowest possible CO2 emissions. Test cycles included the heavy duty FPT (hot and cold), a low load cycle, a beverage cycle, and a stay hot operation. The data found in this study show how the application of a low power e-heater enables an engine with CDA and an aftertreatment system after 800,000 miles aging to meet ultra-low NO<sub>x</sub> emissions with minimum CO<sub>2</sub> penalty.</div></div>

Nuclear power plants and research purposed reactors produce spent nuclear fuel, which leads to a need for safe spent fuel management and radiation protection. Traditionally, concrete with the addition of different aggregates has been the primary material for shielding against radiation and is used also for transport and storage of radioactive waste. Despite these applications, there is still a need to develop new composite materials that will preserve the radiation shielding properties of concrete, while offering superior mechanical and also cost effective benefits. This article investigates the radiation shielding properties of HI-STORM containers, made of a new composite material, and reinforced with basalt-boron fibre for human and environment protection. In the concrete recipe, part of the cement is replaced by oil shale ash with cementitious characteristics. The formulation of concrete reinforced with basalt-boron fibre (with the addition of 6% boron oxide) is presented. Oil shale ash (OSA) is a class-C fly ash, a by-product in the energy production process. OSA can be used as a partial replacement to cement in concretes, thanks to its cement-like qualities and low carbon content, which contributes to a reduction in the overall CO2 footprint of concrete. In our investigated concrete mixes 5 to 35% of cement was replaced by OSA (Electrostatic Precipitator Ash) coming from Auvere (Estonia) thermal power plant. Using the Monte Carlo method, the Serpent code was used to simulate the passage of neutron radiation through a composite material to assess its biological shielding properties. It is shown that the addition of basalt-boron fibre to concrete improves the protective properties of biological shielding against neutron radiation.

Speciation of selected heavy metals in Abuja metropolitan soil samples was investigated using a sequential extraction analytical technique. Flame atomic absorption spectrometer was used for instrumental analysis. Metals were bound in six operational phases, in the sequential extraction method. Pb, Mn and Cd speciate more in exchangeable, As and Ni speciate more in bound to carbonate, Cu and Fe speciate more in bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Cr and Zn speciate more in organically bound while Al speciate more in residual in urban soil samples. In sub-urban samples, Pb and Cd speciate more in exchangeable and bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Cu speciate more in exchangeable, Al speciate more in bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Fe and Al speciate more in residual, Ni and As speciate more in bound to carbonate, Zn speciate more in organically bound and Cr speciate more in exchangeable and organically bound. Asokoro Forest (control) has most of the metals as non-residuals except Al and As which speciate more in residual phase. Sequence of ionic mobility in decreasing order for Abuja urban soils is as follows: Zn>Cu>Fe>Al>Mn>>As>Ni>Cr>Cd>Pb and in sub-urban soil samples is: Zn>Cu>Fe>Al>Mn>>Ni>As>Pb>Cd>Cr. From the results, it can be deduced that Zn is the ion with highest speciation. This portends danger to Abuja metropolis due to Zn phytoxicity which hinders photosynthesis in plants, thereby increasing the amount of CO2 giving rise to global warming. This requires that relevant authorities should enforce reduction of the activities that lead to abundance of Zn in Abuja soils.

Abstract Despite high expectations about the role of carbon removal in meeting global climate targets, many of the proposed techniques remain nascent. This is especially so for techniques with potential for large-scale, permanent removal of CO2, such as Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) and Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE). In such a context, understanding public attitudes is crucial but challenging, since we do not have enough information about the sociotechnical configurations which might accompany such proposals over future timescales. Carbon removal at scale will not take place in a vacuum – it will co-evolve within political, social, economic, and legal structures which in turn will have a strong influence on public attitudes. This study used a nationally-representative survey (n=1,978) in the UK to test the impact of alternative sociotechnical systems on public attitudes to DACCS and OAE. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five scenario conditions, representing different forms of governance logic (top-down vs bottom-up) and market logic (planned vs liberal economy), plus one with minimal sociotechnical information. We find that the scenario condition significantly impacted perceptions of OAE, with participants preferring its implementation within a bottom-up, planned economy scenario, and rejecting scenarios which most closely resembled the status quo. There were no significant differences between scenarios for DACCS, suggesting that the technology may be more flexible across alternative sociotechnical arrangements. OAE arouses more negative emotions, particularly worry about impacts on ocean ecosystems, whereas DACCS arouses more hope. We found that climate worry is associated with stronger emotions – both positive and negative – toward both techniques, thus CDR could be polarising for the most climate-worried, likely due to tensions between climate urgency and concerns about deterring emissions reductions. The most important criteria for future CDR deployment were deemed to be biodiversity, durability, and cost, with a strong discourse around the current cost-of-living crisis.

Mulching cultivation with agricultural wastes is the main production pattern of coffee at present, but the effect of mulching cultivation on photosynthetic physiological processes of coffee plants is still not clear. Therefore, a randomized block design was adopted to establish a field experiment by one-year-old Coffee Canephora seedlings in this study. There were four types of mulch treatments, including non-mulch coffee waste (C), mulching coffee litter (L), mulching coffee cascara (cherry pericarp, P), and mulching coffee litter and cascara (LP) in this field experiment. Soil properties and microenvironment (e.g., moisture, temperature, pH, bulk density, organic matter content, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen content, available potassium content, and available potassium content), agronomic traits (e.g., specific leaf area, leaf area index, plant height, and relative chlorophyll content), and photosynthetic indices (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration, respiration, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, water use efficiency, and carbon use efficiency) were investigated to determine the effects of different coffee waste mulches on the photosynthetic physiology of coffee seedlings. The results show that coffee litter and cascara mulch significantly reduced soil temperature by 0.42 or 0.33 °C, respectively, and coffee litter rather than cascara mulch significantly increased the soil’s available potassium content by 46.28%, although coffee waste mulch did not affect other soil properties or microenvironment indices; coffee cascara mulching significantly increased the specific leaf area and net and gross photosynthesis of coffee by 45.46%, 78.33%, and 91.72%, respectively, but the mulching treatments did not affect stomatal conductance, transpiration, or carbon use efficiency in this study. Additionally, coffee cascara mulching increased leaf respiration and net and gross water use efficiency by 109.34%, 80.54%, and 104.95%, respectively. The coffee cascara mulching alone had the most significant positive impact on the photosynthetic index, followed by a combination of litter and cascara, litter alone, and the control treatment. The observed variations in the coffee photosynthetic index may be attributed to the reduction of soil temperature caused by mulching treatments rather than the increase in soil nutrients content. These results indicate that coffee cascara mulching could effectively promote photosynthesis and the growth of coffee seedlings by improving the soil microenvironment.    

    

## Impact of Multi-Energy System and Different Control Strategies on a Generic Low-Voltage Distribution Grid

The rising electricity costs, cost of space heating, and domestic hot water end up driving consumers toward reducing expenses by generating their electricity through devices like photovoltaic systems and efficient combined heat and power plants. When coupled with thermal systems via an energy management system (EMS) in a Multi-Energy System (MES), this self-produced electricity can effectively lower electricity and heating bills. However, MESs with EMSs can serve various purposes beyond cost reduction via self-consumption, such as reacting to variable electricity prices, meeting special grid connection conditions, or minimizing CO2 emissions. These diverse strategies create unique prosumer profiles, deviating significantly from standard load profiles. The potential threat to the power grid arises as grid operators lack visibility into which consumers employ which control strategies. This paper investigates the impact of controlled MESs on the power grid compared to average households and answers whether new control strategies affect the planning strategies of low voltage grids. It proposes a comprehensive four-step toolchain for the detailed simulation of thermal–electrical load profiles, MES control strategies, and grid dynamics. It includes a new method for the grid impact analysis of extreme and average bulk values. As a result, this study identifies three primary factors influencing distribution power grids by MESs. Firstly, the presence and scale of photovoltaic (PV) systems significantly affect extreme values in the grid. Secondly, MESs incorporating combined heat and power (CHP) and heat pump (HP) units impact the overall grid performance, mainly reflected in bulk values. Thirdly, the placement of an MES with heating systems, especially when concentrated in one feeder, plays a crucial role in grid dynamics. Despite the three distinct factors identified as impactful on the power grid, this study reveals that the various control strategies, despite leading to vastly different grid profiles, do not exhibit divergent impacts on buses, lines, or transformers. Remarkably, the impact of MESs remains consistently similar across the range of control strategies studied. Therefore, different control strategies do not pose an additional challenge to the grid integration of MESs.
