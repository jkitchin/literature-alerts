Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction by CO2 reductases is a promising approach for biomanufacturing. Among all known biological or chemical catalysts, hydrogen-dependent carbon dioxide reductase from Thermoanaerobacter kivui (TkHDCR) possesses the highest activity toward CO2 reduction. Herein, we engineer TkHDCR to generate an electro-responsive carbon dioxide reductase considering the safety and convenience. To achieve this purpose, a recombinant Escherichia coli TkHDCR overexpression system is established. The formate dehydrogenase is obtained via subunit truncation and rational design, which enables direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalysis with a near-zero overpotential. By applying a constant voltage of −500 mV (vs. SHE) to a mediated electrolytic cell, 22.8 ± 1.6 mM formate is synthesized in 16 h with an average production rate of 7.1 ± 0.5 μmol h−1cm−2, a Faradaic efficiency of 98.9% and a half-cell energy efficiency of 94.4%. This study provides an enzyme candidate for high efficient CO2 reduction and opens up a way to develop paradigm for CO2-based bio-manufacturing. Thermoanaerobacter kivui-drived CO2 reductase (TkHDCR) requires hydrogen as substrate, which can lead to safety issue. Here, the authors engineered TkHDCR into an electro-responsive carbon dioxide reductase to harvest electrons from either an external mediator or a polarized electroactive surface.

In recent years, the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) has made many advances in C2+ production. Cu+/Cu0 site is beneficial for C‐C coupling process, but the oxidation state of copper cannot be well maintained during the reaction process, resulting in a decrease in catalyst activity. Based on this consideration, in this work, transition metal oxide CeO2 with a hollow cube structure and oxygen vacancies was introduced to stabilize and increase Cu+/Cu0 active sites (Ce1Cu2). The catalyst exhibits excellent CO2RR performance, with FEC2+ achieving 73.52% and jC2+ > 280 mA/cm2 at 1.26 V (vs. RHE). Ethanol is the main C2+ product and FEethanol reaches 39% at 1.26 V. The experimental results indicate that the presence of CeO2 provides a large number of oxygen vacancies and forming Cu+‐O2‐‐Ce4+ structure by the strong interaction of CeO2 and Cu NPs. The structure of Cu+‐O2‐‐Ce4+ and abundant oxygen vacancies lay a good foundation for the CO2 adsorption. Moreover, it increases the content of Cu+/Cu0 sites, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction, promoting the C‐C coupling interaction, thereby facilitating the generation of C2+ products. The DFT theoretical calculation further demonstrates that Ce1Cu2 is more inclined towards the ethanol pathway, confirming its high selectivity for ethanol.

Electroreduction of carbon dioxide into value‐added fine chemicals is a promising technique to realize the carbon cycle. Recently, metal‐free heteroatom doped carbons are proposed as promising cost‐effective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the lack of understanding of the active site prevents the realization of a high‐performance electrocatalyst for the CO2RR. Herein, we synthesized metal‐free N, P co‐doped carbons (NPCs) for producing syngas, which is composed of H2 and CO, by CO2 electrolysis using inexpensive bio‐based raw materials via simple pyrolysis. The syngas ratio (H2/CO) can be controlled within the high demand range (0.3‐4) at low potentials using NPCs by tuning the N and P contents. In comparison with only N doping or P doping, N and P co‐doping has a positive impact on improving CO2RR activity. Experimental analysis and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations revealed that negatively charged C atoms adjacent to N and P atoms are the most favorable active sites for CO2‐to‐CO conversion compared to pyridinic N on N, P co‐doped carbon. Introducing N atoms generates the preferable CO2 adsorption site, and P atoms contribute to decreasing the Gibbs free energy barrier for key *COOH intermediates adsorbed on the negatively charged C atoms.

Nickel(II) complexes bearing tetradentate NCCN ligands composed of optionally protic pyridine and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors have been synthesized and used as catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. These complexes were synthesized bearing OMe, OBn, or OH substituents on the pyridine rings and were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, UV–vis, IR, HR-MS, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The OH substituent was partially deprotonated, as shown by the crystal structure. Electrochemical studies show that these nickel complexes undergo two electron reduction events prior to CO2 reduction. Catalytic current enhancement under CO2 relative to N2 is not observed under dry conditions, but the addition of proton sources leads to modest current enhancement (icat/ip < 2). Visible light driven photochemical CO2 reduction with a photosensitizer (Ir(ppy)3, where ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) and sacrificial electron and proton donors was studied, and formate is the major product with ∼10:1 formate to CO production. Electron donor groups (OMe, OBn, OH) do not enhance formate production (relative to the unsubstituted analogue), and CO production is only slightly enhanced. Overall with Ni(II), the tetradentate ligands are comparable to recently published pincer ligands for sensitized CO2 reduction, but pincer ligands offer a clear advantage in self-sensitized catalysis.

Abstract Developing advanced and economically viable technologies for the capture and utilization of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is crucial for sustainable energy production from fossil fuels. Converting CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising approach to mitigate atmospheric CO 2 levels. Among various methods, photocatalytic reduction stands out for its potential to reduce emissions and produce useful products. Here, novel perovskite ZnMoFeO 3 (ZMFO) nanosheets are presented as promising semiconductor photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction. Experimental results show that ZMFO has a narrow bandgap, exceptional visible light response, large specific surface area, high crystallinity, and various surface‐active sites, leading to an impressive photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of 24.87 µmolg −1 h −1 and strong stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that CO 2 conversion into CO and CH 4 on the ZMFO surface follows formaldehyde and carbine pathways. This study provides significant insights into designing innovative perovskite oxide‐based photocatalysts for economical and efficient CO 2 reduction systems.

Abstract The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) using nitrogen‐doped carbon (N–C) materials offers a promising and cost‐effective approach to global carbon neutrality. Regulating the porosity of N–C materials can potentially increase the catalytic performance by suppressing the concurrence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the augmentation of porosity usually alters the active sites or the chemical composition of catalysts, resulting in intertwined influences of various structural factors and catalytic performance. In this study, incorporating secondary carbon sources into the metal‐organic framework (MOF) precursor through nanocasting aimed to selectively enhance the mesoporous structure, allowing for deciphering this effect from other changes in the catalyst composition. Consequently, the developed N–C catalyst exhibited a significant surface area with abundant mesopores, leading to a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) for carbon monoxide (CO) of 95% at −0.50 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the FE for CO is enhanced across a wide potential range, surpassing previously reported metal‐free N–C eCO 2 RR catalysts. The investigation reveals that constructing mesoporous structures can induce excellent CO 2 catalysis by enhancing the accessibility of active sites while establishing an elevated local pH at these sites.

The efficient conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) requires the development of stable catalysts with high selectivity and reactivity within a wide potential range. Here, the high-entropy metal sulfide CuAgZnSnS4 is designed for CO2 reduction with excellent performance (FEcarbon products ≥ 90%) in whole test potential windows (600 mV) based on the synergistic effect of the high-entropy metal sulfide. In particular, CuAgZnSnS4 exhibits better single-product selectivity with the highest FEHCOOH/FECO value (29.03) at −1.28 versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In combination with in situ measurements and theoretical calculations, it is further revealed that the synergistic effect of CuAgZnSnS4 realizes the controllable regulation of the surface electronic structure at Sn active sites, strengthening orbital interactions between *OCHO and Sn active sites. As a result, the effective adsorption and activation of *OCHO instead of *H are obtained, improving the single-product selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly. Our findings may complete the understanding of the synergistic effect for high-entropy materials in catalysis and offer new insight into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity.

Efficient CO2 utilization is a critical component of closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Most studies have focused on using pure streams of CO2. However, CO2 is generally only available in dilute streams, which requires capture by sorbents followed by energy intensive regeneration to release concentrated CO2. Direct utilization of sorbed-CO2 avoids the costly regeneration step. Furthermore, the sorbent-CO2 interaction can kinetically activate CO2 and tune its reactivity to access products that could otherwise be inaccessible with direct CO2 reduction. We demonstrate that an N-heterocyclic carbene, 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (DPIy), can capture CO2 from dilute streams (0.04% and 10%) to form 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium-2-carboxylate (DPICx) quantitatively. Electrocatalyst iron tetraphenylporphyrin chloride (Fe(TPP)Cl) typically reduces CO2 to CO; however, with DPICx as the substrate, the 8-electron reduced product methane (CH4) is produced with high (>85%) Faradaic efficiency and regeneration of the sorbent DPIy. In addition to the overall energy and capital advantages of integrated CO2 capture and conversion, these studies illustrate how sorbents can serve a dual purpose for both CO2 capture and chemical auxiliary to access unique products. CO2 has a spectrum of reactivity with different types of sorbents; these results reveal how sorbent-CO2 interactions can be leveraged for integrated capture and utilization platforms to access a wider range of CO2-derived products.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is emerging as a promising technology to address anthropogenic carbon emissions, with the searching of effective catalysts being the primary barrier toward industrial implementation. This review starts from the long-standing debates over the role of subsurface oxygen and positively charged metal sites (Mδ+) within oxide-derived catalysts. Thereafter, we focus on the strategy of constructing metal–metal oxide hybrid catalysts, which is enriched with M1–O–M2 heterojunctions that capable of maintaining a positive valence state of active sites and improving CO2 reduction performance. Specifically, advances in metal–metal oxide hybrid catalysts for CO2-to-C1 conversions are overviewed for selective CO, formate, or CH4 production, respectively. Thereafter, we summarize the interfacial engineering approaches for Cu/MOx hybrid catalysts aimed at selective C2+ production, including the interfacial boundary density, the morphology effect of MOx support, the choice of MOx, and their interaction manipulation with Cu sites. This review concludes with an outlook on the challenges and future directions for developing precisely controlled hybrid catalysts with an in-depth understanding of structure–performance relationship. Continued interdisciplinary collaborations from materials science, surface chemistry, analytical methodology, and theoretical modeling will be pivotal in overcoming existing challenges and pushing the frontiers of CO2 reduction research.

Developing effective electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 to CO is essential for enhancing the global carbon cycle. In this article, we report the synthesis of Cu3P/C nanomaterials, derived from the copper-based MOF (HKUST-1), using a novel phosphidation method. To enhance the copper contents in the final material, HKUST-1 is impregnated in Cu2+ solutions of various concentrations, followed by phosphidation. Cu3P nanoparticles fully embedded in hierarchical carbon have been confirmed by using transmission electron microscopy. These nanoparticles exhibit remarkable efficiency in the reduction of CO2 to CO. Among the various synthesized electrocatalysts, the optimal electrocatalyst, i.e., (5 M) Cu3P/C demonstrates outstanding performance, which shows 88% Faradaic efficiency for CO production. It also demonstrates a low overpotential (η) of only 177 mV, a high current density (j) of 60 mA cm–2, and long-term stability over 20 h at various potentials in 0.1 M KHCO3 medium, making it an excellent choice for CO2 reduction applications. The catalyst's exceptional selectivity for converting CO2 to CO is further validated by qualitative detection of CO using the PdCl2 strips method.

One of the most promising approaches in solving the energy crisis and reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions is artificial photosynthetic CO2 reduction. The electrochemical method for CO2 reduction is more appealing since it can be operated under ambient conditions, and the product selectivity strongly depends on the applied potential. Perovskites with ferroelectric properties strongly adsorb linear CO2 molecules. In this study, barium titanate (BaTiO3) perovskite is used as an electrocatalyst to promote CO2 activation and conversion to CO. Perovskite catalysts were prepared by ball‐milling followed by annealing at 900 °C for 4 to 6 h in an open atmosphere. The TEM and SEM study shows that the particle size varies in the range of 80‐200 nm. Mixed phases of BaTiO3 and BaTi5O11 supported on nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes are found to be highly active for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 89.4% at ‐1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl in CO2 saturated 0.5 KOH solution. This study concludes that mixed phases of BaTiO3 and BaTi5O11 are more active and highly selective for CO2 conversion to CO compared to single‐phase BaTiO3.

Photocatalytic methods offer a sustainable approach to chemical production, reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources and addressing climate change. Traditional H2O2 production often involves hazardous chemicals, while photocatalysis is cleaner and generates fewer by-products. Similarly, rising CO2 levels from fossil fuel combustion contribute to global warming, making photocatalytic CO2 reduction via Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) a promising solution by repurposing CO2 into useful products. Chapter 1 introduced novel semiconductor photocatalysts including their syntheses strategies and their photocatalytic applications. This chapter subsequently introduced the photocatalytic production of H2O2 and the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. It covered the discussion of associated reaction mechanism, the preparation and performance of catalysts, as well as practical applications such as the production of H2O2 from seawater and the reduction of CO2 from exhaust gases. Finally, the challenges and aims of these works was discussed. Chapter 2 presented a BiOBr-lignin composite photocatalyst which was designed for producing H2O2 directly from seawater. Various characterization techniques revealed the structural morphological and optical properties of the photocatalyst. The presence of lignin not only provided structural support but also lowered the reduction potential of the catalyst. Furthermore, the functional groups in the lignin acted as an electron sink upon ionization with metal ions present in the seawater, facilitated through Bronsted-Lowry base proton abstraction. The study delved into the oxygen reduction reaction mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic process. Chapter 3 discussed a Mn-based single atom photocatalyst which were designed for the efficient production of H2O2 directly from seawater through the water oxidation reaction. Advanced characterization techniques and multiscale molecular modeling revealed the structural morphological and electronic properties of the Mn-photocatalyst. The research was delved into the mechanism of the water oxidation reaction. It was found that the atomically dispersed Mn centers played a crucial role in promoting the formation of hydroxy radical (•OH), which was essential intermediates in the production of H2O2. Chapter 4 focused on an iron-based photocatalyst which has been designed for converting impure CO2 streams into valuable products as part of the carbon capture and utilization (CCU) approach. This catalyst demonstrated an impressive production rate of 145 mmol g-1 h-1 for CO generation, highlighting its efficiency in utilizing sunlight for chemical transformation. The comprehensive characterization, mechanistic insights, and impressive performance metrics underscore its potential for practical applications in carbon capture and utilization strategies.

Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C−C coupling. Herein, we designed highly active metal atom clusters anchored on semiconductor nanosheet, which established heteroatom sites on the interface to steer C−C coupling, realizing air‐concentration CO2 photoreduction into C2H4 in pure water for the first time. As an example, the Pd nanoclusters loaded on ZnO nanosheets are prepared, demonstrated by the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high‐angle annular dark‐field image. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the C−C coupling step over the Pd‐ZnO nanosheets, while quasi in situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrates the active sites of Pd and Zn atoms on the Pd‐ZnO nanosheets during CO2 photoreduction. Density functional theoretical calculations unveil the transition state energy barrier of C–C coupling of CO* and COH* intermediates are only 0.998 eV, hinting the easy C–C coupling to produce C2 fuels. Therefore, the Pd‐ZnO nanosheets first realize C2H4 photosynthesis by atmospheric‐concentration CO2 reduction with the formation rate of 1.03 μmol g−1 h−1, while the ZnO nanosheets only acquired the carbon monoxide product.

Electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (eCO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals offers an attractive strategy to solve energy and environmental problems simultaneously. We have mapped out entire reaction pathways of eCO2RR to CO on Cu(100), including all intermediates and transition states using first‐principles simulations. To accurately account for the solvent effect, the reaction was investigated with and without explicit water molecules, highlighting the limitations of the often (mis)used vacuum reaction pathway simplification. The results show that the reduction reaction was initiated under neutral pH conditions at an applied potential of –0.11 V (RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) and all elementary reactions were thermodynamically favorable, while an applied potential of –1.24 V is required to ensure that all reactions exhibit spontaneous behavior. Detailed analysis revealed that solvation significantly influences the stability of the adsorbates and intermediates. Its inclusion notably alters the calculated reaction kinetics and energetic parameters by lowering the barrier energies and Gibbs free energies of all reactions. CO production proceeded mainly via the COOH* pathway (CO2‐‐>trans‐COOH*‐‐>cis‐COOH*‐‐>CO*+OH*‐‐>CO*‐‐>CO). The use of water as a more sustainable and cost‐effective solvent is compared to other options such as organic solvents, ionic liquids and mixed solvent systems, which are less sustainable and more expensive.

Abstract: One of the first gas lasers to be created was the carbon-dioxide laser (CO2 laser). One of the most practical kinds of lasers, it was created in 1964 by Bell Labs' Kumar Patel [22]. The most powerful continuous-wave lasers on the market right now are carbon-dioxide lasers. Additionally, they are quite efficient; the output power to pump power ratio can reach 20%. The primary wavelength bands of the infrared light beam produced by the CO2 laser are 9.6 and 10.6 micrometers (μm). [22] In order to improve its performance, a carbon dioxide laser uses carbon dioxide as its main gain medium. Nitrogen (N2), helium (He), and occasionally hydrogen (H2), water vapor, oxygen, or xenon (Xe) are added. This laser works by energizing the gas mixture to produce laser light by promoting the emission of radiation by an electrical gas discharge. In carbon dioxide lasers, the electrical gas discharge can be powered by radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), or alternating current (AC). The wavelength of the light emitted by these lasers is 10.6 micrometers. In dermatology, they are frequently used for operations like wrinkle reduction, scar removal, and sun damage treatment. Furthermore, for accurate cutting and tissue removal, carbon dioxide lasers are employed as surgical instruments in specialties such as neurosurgery and gynecology.[24]

Abstract Electrifying on-road trucking is a strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector. While battery-electric trucks have zero tailpipe emissions, the associated increase in electric sector grid emissions would offset a portion of on-road emission reductions. We utilize a techno-economic energy systems optimization model to assess the system-wide carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutant emissions implications of medium- and heavy-duty truck electrification in the United States. Results suggest that transitioning to 100% battery electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sales by 2050 would result in net CO2 emission benefits should the electric sector is decarbonizing simultaneously. Combining a tax of $100 per ton of CO2, increasing at 5% per year, with electrification targets would yield a net 52% reduction in energy system CO2 emissions in 2050. Across regions, transportation sector NOX emissions – an ozone precursor - further decreases by 9-26% compared to BAU level in 2050. The level of emission reductions and extend of transportation decarbonization are driven by vehicle cost and performance projections along with underlying assumptions on time of charging.

Phthalocyanines have emerged as attractive materials for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. However, the challenge of finding a support that is stable while maintaining catalytic activity and loading remains elusive. Porous carbon materials are considered reliable substrates for supporting molecular catalysts. Herein, a nitrogen-rich carbon nanosheet (NiPc/NMCN) with multilayer and mesoporous structure is synthesized based on a kinetically controlled self-assembly strategy and used for phthalocyanine loading. The multilayer composite structure of NMCN guides the molecular-scale dispersion of phthalocyanine and plays a crucial role in its catalytic process. Moreover, the phthalocyanine molecules retain their metal-N4 structure after impregnation. Therefore, the remarkable CO2 electroreduction properties of phthalocyanine are fully demonstrated. At −0.73 V vs. RHE, NiPc/NMCN achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 96.0%. Meanwhile, current densities in membrane electrode module electrolyzers can reach industrial amperage levels, while the FEco remains at 60% at 880 mA cm–2. Density functional theory (DFT) indicates that the high performance of NiPc/NMCN is attributed to the significant reduction of the CO2RR energy barrier. Phthalocyanines restricted by the porous carbon could produce the intermediate *COOH more rapidly, determining high CO2RR selectivity, which is confirmed by in situ (FTIR) spectroscopy. Consequently, the strategy of constructing confined multilayer mesoporous carbon structures provides an avenue for the design of efficient CO2 reduction molecular catalysts.

This study focused on the land use (LU) structure and carbon emissions (CEs) in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai provinces of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China from 2000 to 2020, using the STIRPAT model and scenario analysis (SA). We conducted an analysis of the influence exerted by relevant factors on land use carbon emissions (LUCEs) and made forecasts regarding the diverse development scenarios of CE trends, aiming to provide methodological guidance for validating the effectiveness of existing policies in reducing CEs and offer direction for achieving the peak CO2 emissions target as soon as possible. It also constitutes a significant reference for the early realization of the peak CO2 emissions target. The results indicated the following: (1) Between 2000 and 2020, CEs resulting from LU in the YRD rose from 2.70 × 108 t to 9.10 × 108 t, marking an increase of 243.77%. In 2020, the built-up area was the predominant contributor to CEs, representing 99.15% of the overall carbon sources, whereas forests served as the main carbon sink, comprising 92.37% of the total carbon sinks (CSs) for that year. (2) For each percent increase in the parameters considered in this study, the corresponding increases in LU CO2 emissions were estimated to be: 1.932% (population), 0.241% (GDP per capita), −0.141% (energy intensity), 0.043% (consumption structure), 1.045% (industrial structure), and 0.975% (urbanization). (3) According to the existing policy framework and development plans, the YRD is expected to achieve peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. If energy conservation and carbon reduction strategies are implemented, this peak could be achieved as early as 2025. However, if economic growth continues to depend primarily on fossil fuel consumption, the region may not hit its carbon peak until 2035. (4) The low-carbon scenario, which considers the needs of social progress alongside the intensity of carbon emission reductions, represents the most effective development strategy for reaching a carbon peak in LU within the YRD. Effectively managing population size and facilitating the upgrading of industrial structures are key strategies to hasten the achievement of peaking carbon dioxide emissions in the region.

The agenda to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in order to mitigate climate change remains a global concern. Researchers, policymakers and governments have shown interest in this regard. While empirical studies on the subject matter has been increasing conflicting results and little evidence on the effects of some variables necessitate for further studies. In this study the effect of female population, urbanization and trade openness on carbon dioxide emission in Ghana is assessed. The study used the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, & Technology (STIRPAT) model as the foundation for empirical modelling. Time series data spanning from 1971-2018 was used for regression analysis. In both long run and short run periods, urbanization was noted to exert positive influence on carbon dioxide emission while trade openness and female population exert negative effect on carbon dioxide emission. Thus, growth in urbanization increases carbon dioxide emission while the opposite is the case for trade openness and female population. Findings from the study suggest intensifying the empowerment of women could be a crucial catalyst for the achievement of Ghana’s nationally determined contributions toward CO2 reduction. Also, trade negotiations that promote environmental protection should not be relaxed

Eco-design is an important consideration in the development of home appliance products. It encourages the use of more environmentally friendly materials in the manufacturing of appliances to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, limit energy consumption and improve product performance. This paper offers a thorough method for eco-design using CAD tools, emphasizing material selection to reduce environmental impacts throughout a product’s lifecycle. CAD systems are combined with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), as demonstrated in a case study involving an electric iron device. The research presents a systematic approach to minimizing adverse effects by evaluating environmental impacts, particularly CO2 emissions and energy consumption, and comparing alternative materials. According to the findings, the substitution of aluminium oxide for stainless steel in the iron plate component can significantly reduce the environmental impact, resulting in reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption by 82.02 % and 80.42% respectively. This method will help designers to make well-informed choices early in the design process to improve product sustainability and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of material selection to eco-design as well as how the use of CAD-integrated LCA tools may promote the creation of sustainable products.

Biological systems can directly upgrade carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals. The CO2 fixation rate of autotrophic organisms, however, is too slow for industrial utility, and the breadth of engineered metabolic pathways for the synthesis of value-added chemicals is too limited. Biotechnology workhorse organisms with extensively engineered metabolic pathways have recently been engineered for CO2 fixation. Yet, their low carbon fixation rate, compounded by the fact that living organisms split their carbon between cell growth and chemical synthesis, has led to only cell growth with no chemical synthesis achieved to date. Here, we engineer a lysate-based cell-free expression (CFE)-based multienzyme biocatalyst for the carbon negative synthesis of the industrially relevant amino acids glycine and serine from CO2 equivalents─formate and bicarbonate─and ammonia. The formate-to-serine biocatalyst leverages tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent formate fixation, reductive glycine synthesis, serine synthesis, and phosphite dehydrogenase-dependent NAD(P)H regeneration to convert 30% of formate into serine and glycine, surpassing the previous 22% conversion using a purified enzyme system. We find that (1) the CFE-based biocatalyst is active even after 200-fold dilution, enabling higher substrate loading and product synthesis without incurring additional cell lysate cost, (2) NAD(P)H regeneration is pivotal to driving forward reactions close to thermodynamic equilibrium, (3) balancing the ratio of the formate-to-serine pathway genes added to the CFE is key to improving amino acid synthesis, and (4) efficient THF recycling enables lowering the loading of this cofactor, reducing the cost of the CFE-based biocatalyst. To our knowledge, this is the first synthesis of amino acids that can capture CO2 equivalents for the carbon negative synthesis of amino acids using a CFE-based biocatalyst. Looking ahead, the CFE-based biocatalyst process could be extended beyond serine to pyruvate, a key intermediate, to access a variety of chemicals from aromatics and terpenes to alcohols and polymers.

Abstract. Ocean liming has gained attention as a potential solution to mitigate climate change by actively removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The addition of hydrated lime to oceanic surface water leads to an increase in alkalinity, which in turn promotes the uptake and sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Despite the potential of this technique, its effects on the marine ecosystem are still far from understood, and there is currently no information on the potential impacts on the concentration and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is one of the largest, most complex and yet least understood mixtures of organic molecules on Earth. The aim of this study is to provide the first experimental evidence about the potential effects of hydrated lime addition on DOM dynamics in the oceans by assessing changes in its concentration and optical properties (absorption and fluorescence). To investigate the effects of liming on DOM pools with different concentrations and quality, seawater was collected from two contrasting environments: the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea, known for its dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration comparable to that observed in the oceans, and the eutrophic Baltic Sea, characterized by high DOM concentration mostly of terrestrial origin. Hydrated lime was added to both waters to reach pH values of 9 and 10. Our findings reveal that the addition of hydrated lime has a noticeable effect on DOM dynamics in both the Mediterranean Sea and Baltic Sea, determining a reduction in DOC concentration and a change in the optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) of DOM. These effects, detectable at pH 9, become significant at pH 10 and are more pronounced in the Mediterranean Sea than in the Baltic Sea. These potential short-term effects should be considered within the context of the physicochemical properties of seawater and the seasonal variability.

Abstract. Previous phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) have primarily focused on simulations driven by atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), for both idealized model experiments and climate projections of different emissions scenarios. We argue that although this approach was practical to allow parallel development of Earth system model simulations and detailed socioeconomic futures, carbon cycle uncertainty as represented by diverse, process-resolving Earth system models (ESMs) is not manifested in the scenario outcomes, thus omitting a dominant source of uncertainty in meeting the Paris Agreement. Mitigation policy is defined in terms of human activity (including emissions), with strategies varying in their timing of net-zero emissions, the balance of mitigation effort between short-lived and long-lived climate forcers, their reliance on land use strategy, and the extent and timing of carbon removals. To explore the response to these drivers, ESMs need to explicitly represent complete cycles of major GHGs, including natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Carbon removal and sequestration strategies, which rely on proposed human management of natural systems, are currently calculated in integrated assessment models (IAMs) during scenario development with only the net carbon emissions passed to the ESM. However, proper accounting of the coupled system impacts of and feedback on such interventions requires explicit process representation in ESMs to build self-consistent physical representations of their potential effectiveness and risks under climate change. We propose that CMIP7 efforts prioritize simulations driven by CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and projected deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, as well as land use and management, using the process resolution allowed by state-of-the-art ESMs to resolve carbon–climate feedbacks. Post-CMIP7 ambitions should aim to incorporate modeling of non-CO2 GHGs (in particular, sources and sinks of methane and nitrous oxide) and process-based representation of carbon removal options. These developments will allow three primary benefits: (1) resources to be allocated to policy-relevant climate projections and better real-time information related to the detectability and verification of emissions reductions and their relationship to expected near-term climate impacts, (2) scenario modeling of the range of possible future climate states including Earth system processes and feedbacks that are increasingly well-represented in ESMs, and (3) optimal utilization of the strengths of ESMs in the wider context of climate modeling infrastructure (which includes simple climate models, machine learning approaches and kilometer-scale climate models).

Climate change stands out as a significant environmental issue on a global scale, with greenhouse gases being one of its primary drivers. The greenhouse gas process provides a critical framework for understanding the sources, emissions, and environmental impacts of these gases. This article presents an overview of the fundamental elements of the greenhouse gas process in the textile sector and discusses how it should be managed in line with sustainability goals. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2O), and fluorinated gases are the most common greenhouse gases, each derived from different sources. The textile sector is particularly associated with high greenhouse gas emissions, especially in areas such as energy consumption, water usage, and waste management. Therefore, measurements taken in factories are crucial for identifying emission sources and developing reduction strategies. This article examines in detail the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from various activities at Kıvanç Textile. Energy consumption, particularly the emissions resulting from the fuels used in electricity and heating processes, is evaluated. Additionally, emissions from other important sources such as refrigerant gas leaks, waste management, and transportation are analyzed. The measurement process was carried out in accordance with national and international standards. The greenhouse gas inventory includes data on energy consumption, fuel consumption, refrigerant gas usage, transportation, production process management, and waste management throughout the factory. Based on these data, the total amount and sources of emissions were determined. This study presents a systematic method for calculating a company’s carbon footprint, with data collected in accordance with national and international standards. Such data can provide a reference point for other companies when making similar calculations. All of the businesses of the facility where the study was conducted were examined and calculations were made on a total of 1350 employees. As a result of the detailed study, Kıvanç Textile’s corporate carbon footprint for 2023 was calculated as a total of 68,746.86 tons CO2e. According to this data obtained, Kıvanç Textile emitted 50.92 tons of CO2e greenhouse gases per employee. At the same time, it was determined that the production in 2023 was 4,427,082 tons and a greenhouse gas emission of 15.53 tons of CO2e per production (ton) was calculated. This study also includes proposed strategies for reducing emissions. These strategies include energy efficiency measures, the use of renewable energy sources, waste reduction, and the adoption of efficient production processes. In conclusion, this article emphasizes the importance of efforts to measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in textile factories. Kıvanç Textile’s greenhouse gas measurements provide a fundamental reference for achieving sustainability goals in the sector. The data obtained will support the factory’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and minimize its environmental impacts.

[Dean Michael Frossard](https://openalex.org/A5114727424), No host. None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.32469/10355/106123.
    
[EMBARGOED UNTIL 08/01/2025] This thesis investigates the impact of nitrification inhibitors and varying fertilizer rates on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield in agricultural systems. Fertilized agricultural soils can experience notable losses of nitrogen gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) after the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. In the Midwest U.S., anhydrous ammonia and urea are common nitrogen sources used in corn cropping systems. Nitrification inhibitors pronitridine and dicyandiamide (DCD) have demonstrated potential to enhance corn grain yield when applied with N fertilizer. The first chapter explores the efficacy of pronitridine in reducing N2O and NH3 emissions from corn fields fertilized with anhydrous ammonia. Results from field trials conducted in Northeast Missouri over two growing seasons indicated that while pronitridine did not significantly reduce cumulative NH3 emissions in both seasons, it lowered N2O emissions from higher fertilizer rates in the 2023 growing season. Grain yield increased with fertilizer rate and the addition of pronitridine. Overall, we found that pronitridine did not affect cumulative N2O and NH3 emissions (outside of 202N fertilizer rate for N2O in 2023) but has the potential to increase grain yield. The second chapter examines the effects of urea fertilizer and DCD on N2O, NH3, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) in bare soil. Findings revealed that increased fertilizer rates led to higher NH3 emissions, while DCD application had a marginal effect on reducing N2O emissions, with greater reductions observed at higher DCD rates. Our data supports other work concluding DCD has the potential to reduce N2O emissions but highlights the potential for greater reductions through increased DCD rates.

It is still unclear whether emissions reductions from electric vehicles can be achieved across different regions from a lifecycle perspective. Here we use the life cycle assessment model and Quasi Input-Output model to evaluate the carbon dioxide emissions and air pollutants of internal combustion engine vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles in different provinces of China, with the provincial electricity consumption data and the sales data of electric vehicles. We find that battery electric vehicles have achieved 11.8% and 1.1% reduction in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, respectively, compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. In contrast, the emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter 2.5 increased by 10% and 20%, respectively. Due to the coal-based power generation structure and the cold weather, the emission intensity of battery electric vehicles in most northern provinces is higher than that in southern provinces. From 2020 to 2030, improving technological progress and optimizing electricity mix will greatly assist in achieving emissions reduction. The results can help policy-makers better understand the emission characteristics and reasonably plan future emission reduction strategies in transportation. The emission intensities of carbon dioxide and air pollutants from battery electric vehicles are high in northern provinces of China due to the coal-based electricity mix and cold weather, according to an analysis that uses a life cycle assessment model and data on electricity generation.

This study proposes a dual-fuel approach combining diesel and ammonia in a single-cylinder compression ignition engine to reduce harmful emissions from internal combustion. Diesel is directly injected into the combustion chamber, while ammonia is introduced through the intake manifold with intake air. In this study, injection timing and the percentage of ammonia energy fraction was varied. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model simulates the combustion and emission processes to assess the impact of varying diesel injection timings and ammonia energy contributions. Findings indicate that as ammonia content increases, the engine experiences reductions in peak in-cylinder pressure, temperature, heat release rate, as well as overall efficiency and power output. Emission results suggest that greater ammonia usage leads to a reduction in soot, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and unburned hydrocarbons, though a slight increase in nitrogen oxides emissions is observed. This analysis supports ammonia’s potential as a low-emission alternative fuel in future compression ignition engines.

As urbanization continues to accelerate, the application of permeable concrete is becoming an increasingly prevalent practice. Nevertheless, the carbon dioxide emission issue associated with traditional permeable concrete cannot be overlooked. In this study, alkali-activated sintered sludge and slag were employed as raw materials to prepare alkali-activated sintered sludge-slag-based permeable concrete. The effects of sludge calcination temperature, sludge content, and binder-to-aggregate ratio on the compressive strength, porosity, and permeability coefficient of the permeable concrete were investigated through the implementation of one-way experiments. The formation mechanism of permeable concrete materials was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and a carbon emission assessment was performed. The findings indicated that an increase in sludge content resulted in a notable decline in the 28-day compressive strength, accompanied by a reduction in the Ca/Si ratio of the C-A-S-H hydration products, from 1.08 to 0.35. Conversely, the carbon emission assessment demonstrated that abiotic losses declined markedly with an increase in sludge content, effectively mitigating the carbon emission burden associated with construction materials.

В публикации рассматриваются особенности технологии извлечения масла из семян кориандра - как традиционных, так и новой (с использованием диоксида углерода). При этом рассмотрены теоретические аспекты применения диоксида углерода как экстрагента в докритическом (жидком) и сверхкритическом (флюидном) состояниях применительно к извлечению растительных масел и иных компонентов из растительного сырья. Показано, что в процессе экстрагирования обоими видами растворителя жирного масла из масличного сырья, исходные свойства масла, оцениваемые по его жирнокислотному составу, сохраняются. Анализ данных по фракционному составу белков кориандрового шрота показывает, что для обоих вариантов экстрагирования, содержание водорастворимой фракции белков в шротах (наиболее ценной с точки зрения кормовой усвояемости) по сравнению с содержанием ее в соответствующих исходных образцах, снижается. Отмечено, что для другой ценной фракции белков - солерастворимой наблюдается другая тенденция: по сравнению с ее содержанием в исходных образцах процесс жидкостной экстракции вызывает ее снижение, а сверхкритической -повышение. Выход жирного кориандрового масла составил для экстракции жидким диоксидом углерода 68,47%, а для экстракции флюидом - 86,34%. The publication discusses the features of the technology of extracting oil from coriander seeds - both traditional and new (using carbon dioxide). The theoretical aspects of the application of carbon dioxide as an extractant in the precritical (liquid) and supercritical (fluid) states are considered in connection with the extraction of vegetable oils and other components from plant raw materials. It is shown that in the process of extraction by both kinds of a solvent of fatty oil from an oilseed raw material, the initial properties of the oil, evaluated by its fatty acid composition, are preserved. Analysis of the data on the fractional composition of coriander meal proteins shows that for both extraction variants, the content of the water-soluble fraction of proteins in the meal (the most valuable from the point of view of fodder assimilation), as compared with its content in the corresponding initial samples, is reduced. It is noted that for another valuable fraction of proteins - soluble, another tendency is observed: in comparison with its content in the initial samples, the process of liquid extraction causes its reduction, and supercritical - an increase. The yield of fatty coriander oil was 68.47% for extraction with liquid carbon dioxide, and 86.34% for extraction with fluid.

ABSTRACT Incorporating suitable promoters into nickel‐based catalysts for carbon dioxide methanation proves to be a successful strategy for enhancing catalyst structure, optimizing surface properties, mitigating deactivation, and ultimately boosting catalytic performance. This study focuses on the synthesis of Co‐modified Ni/CaCO 3 catalysts using the solution combustion synthesis method. The catalytic activity of the afforded catalysts has been evaluated for CO 2 methanation in a dielectric barrier discharge reactor operating at a gaseous hourly space velocity of 11,320 h −1 and an H 2 :CO 2 ratio of 4:1. The catalyst exhibits optimal performance at a Ni:Co ratio of 13:2, achieving a CO 2 conversion rate of 57.5% and CH 4 selectivity of 92.4%. Characterization techniques such as X‐ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, programmed temperature‐raising hydrogen reduction, carbon dioxide desorption, and in situ plasma DRIFTS are employed to evaluate the catalysts. The results indicate that the addition of Co to Ni‐based catalysts leads to an increase in moderately basic sites, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of catalysts for CO 2 methanation. Notably, the combination of the plasma and the Ni–Co catalyst offers a novel pathway for CO 2 methanation, featuring higher energy efficiency and superior synergistic effects compared to monometallic catalysts.

The search for low-cost, durable, and effective catalysts is essential for green hydrogen production and carbon dioxide upcycling to help in the mitigation of climate change. Discovery of new catalysts is currently limited by the gap between what AI-accelerated computational models predict and what experimental studies produce. To make progress, large and diverse experimental datasets are needed that are reproducible and tested at industrially-relevant conditions. We address these needs by utilizing a comprehensive high-throughput characterization and experimental pipeline to create the Open Catalyst Experiments 2024 (OCX24) dataset. The dataset contains 572 samples synthesized using both wet and dry methods with X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction characterization. We prepared 441 gas diffusion electrodes, including replicates, and evaluated them using zero-gap electrolysis for carbon dioxide reduction (CO$_2$RR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities up to $300$ mA/cm$^2$. To find correlations with experimental outcomes and to perform computational screens, DFT-verified adsorption energies for six adsorbates were calculated on $\sim$20,000 inorganic materials requiring 685 million AI-accelerated relaxations. Remarkably from this large set of materials, a data driven Sabatier volcano independently identified Pt as being a top candidate for HER without having any experimental measurements on Pt or Pt-alloy samples. We anticipate the availability of experimental data generated specifically for AI training, such as OCX24, will significantly improve the utility of computational models in selecting materials for experimental screening.

Abstract Synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a representative pathway for CO2 resource utilisation, which can effectively reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. CeZrO2 can effectively catalyse the generation of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) by direct reaction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methanol (MeOH). However, its morphologically controllable synthesis and resolution of particle agglomeration remain a challenge. In this paper, uniformly dispersed rod-like structures were synthesised by adjusting the composition of the reaction solvent during CeZrO2 synthesis. Experiments and characterisation showed that the addition of alcohol directly affected the morphology and aggregation of ions in solution and promoted the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, thus improving the catalytic performance of rod-shaped CeZrO2. When n-butanol was added at an alcohol-to-water ratio of 1/1, the generation of DMC has been optimised at 4.36 mmol/g, which was about 10% higher than the performance of DMC from a single aqueous solution. In this work, a simple, efficient and rapid modification method was used to achieve the improvement of catalyst performance, and the modulation of the reaction solvent can effectively reduce the cost of catalyst production compared with the doping modification of the catalyst with metal elements, and this study is an important reference for the optimisation of the performance of other types of catalysts.

Purpose The healthcare sector contributes approximately 4% to 5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby impacting climate change. Various initiatives, including teleworking, have been considered to mitigate GHG emissions, but their environmental impact remains poorly defined in the healthcare sector. This study aims to evaluate the impact of teleworking by hospital pharmacists on GHG emissions reduction by comparing the actual situation at one Canadian hospital, which includes teleworking shifts from home, to a scenario where all working shifts necessitate travel to the hospital. Methods The study was conducted at the pharmacy department of an academic hospital with 86 pharmacists (75 pharmacist full-time equivalents), between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2023. Two different online carbon footprint calculators, one developed by the Centres de Gestion des Déplacements (CGD) and one available at the website of Carbon Footprint Ltd., were employed to measure mean GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) for individuals based on their modes of transport and distances traveled between home and work. Results During the study period, teleworking resulted in a significant reduction of mean GHG emissions per pharmacist relative to the scenario of all on-site shifts, with a reduction of 134 kg CO2eq (1,160 CO2eq vs 1,026 CO2eq; t = 3.32; P = 0.0007) estimated with the CGD calculator and a reduction of 135 kg CO2eq (1,117 CO2eq vs 982 CO2eq; t = 4.31; P &lt; 0.0001) estimated with the Carbon Footprint calculator. Those figures correspond to a reduction of 11.5% (11,249 kg CO2eq) to 12.1% (11,315 kg CO2eq) of the total quantity of emissions associated with commuting for the 84 pharmacists over 3 years. The median distance from home to the hospital was 10.0 (8.1) km, with nearly three-quarters of pharmacists commuting by public or active transport. Conclusion Teleworking has a positive environmental impact and could be implemented in other pharmacy departments. The implemented teleworking approach represents an encouraging initial step toward reducing the GHG emissions associated with the travel of employees.

Low carbon hydrogen production is the key to reducing its CO2 emissions. The electrolysis of water for hydrogen production links the CO2 emissions from the power system with those from hydrogen production. This article incorporates the power system into a hydrogen production Integrated MARKAL-EFOM system model and predicts the impact of hydrogen production methods and power structure on CO2 emissions from hydrogen production in China. The results show that: Under the business as usual scenario, the CO2 emissions from hydrogen production are projected to decline in 2045 and then rebound in 2050. It indicates that the current power structure is difficult to support the further reduction of hidden CO2 emissions in the future electrolysis of water for hydrogen production. Hydrogen production technologies optimization has a greater effect on CO2 emissions reduction in hydrogen production, its effect will gradually weaken, whereas the emission reduction effect of power structure optimization will gradually strengthen. The information presented in this paper could be helpful for researchers and policymakers to correctly consider the coupling relationship between power system and hydrogen system in the long-term energy transformation process.

Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a rapidly growing technology at the forefront of sustainable chemistry, leveraging the ability of microorganisms to catalyze electrochemical reactions to synthesize valuable compounds from renewable energy sources. The reduction of CO2 is a major target application for MES, but research in this area has been stifled, especially with the use of direct electron transfer (DET)-based microbial systems. The major fundamental hurdle that needs to be overcome is the low efficiency of CO2 reduction largely attributed to minimal microbial access to CO2 owing to its low solubility in the electrolyte. With their tunable physical properties, ionic liquids present a potential solution to this challenge and have previously shown promise in facilitating efficient CO2 electroreduction by increasing the CO2 solubility. However, the use of ionic liquids in MES remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 as a model DET strain. Electrochemical investigations demonstrated the ability of S. oneidensis MR-1 biocathodes to directly convert CO2 to formate with a faradaic efficiency of 34.5 ± 26.1%. The addition of [EMIM][Ac] to the system significantly increased cathodic current density and enhanced the faradaic efficiency to 94.5 ± 4.3% while concurrently amplifying the product yield from 34 ± 23 μM to 366 ± 34 μM. These findings demonstrate that ionic liquids can serve as efficient, biocompatible cosolvents for microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added products, holding promise for more robust applications of MES.

CO2-soluble surfactant foam systems have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance oil recovery, particularly in tight oil reservoirs where conventional water-soluble surfactants face challenges such as poor injectability and high reservoir sensitivity. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of the basic theory of CO2-soluble surfactant foam, its mechanism in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and the classification and application of various CO2-soluble surfactants. The application of these surfactants in tight oil reservoirs, where low permeability and high water sensitivity limit traditional methods, is highlighted as a promising solution to improve CO2 mobility control and increase oil recovery. The mechanism of enhanced oil recovery by CO2-soluble surfactant foam involves the effective reduction of CO2 fluidity, the decrease in oil–gas flow ratio, and the stabilization of the displacement front. Foam plays a vital role in mitigating the issues of channeling and gravity separation often caused by simple CO2 injection. The reduction in gas fluidity can be attributed to the increase in apparent viscosity and trapped gas fraction. Future research should prioritize the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly CO2-soluble surfactants. It is essential to further explore the advantages and challenges associated with their practical applications in order to maximize their potential impact.

Substituting the traditional fuel combustion heating mode in hydrogen production reactors with electric heating demonstrates a significant potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. An Ni/Al2O3/Ceramic Foam Electric Heating Catalyst was created using a replication template method and a slurry method. On a reactor with dimensions of Φ25 × 800 mm, the differences in the heating rate, axial temperature variance, radial temperature variance, and energy consumption between internal and external heating were analyzed. The results show that: (1) By optimizing the structure of the electric heating wires, the temperature uniformity in the catalyst is enhanced; (2) At 650 °C, 3000 h−1, and S/C = 3, compared to traditional granular catalysts, the internal electric heating reduces the axial temperature variance by 69.4% and the radial temperature variance by 95%; and (3) Achieving a temperature of 650 °C using electric heating only requires 23 min, resulting in a 56.82% reduction in energy consumption compared to external heating.

In the quest to replace fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, developing energy technologies based on clean catalytic processes is fundamental. However, the cost-effectiveness of these technologies strongly relies on the availability of efficient catalysts made of abundant elements. Herein, this study presents a one-step hydrothermal method to obtain a series of Ni3Se4 nanoparticles with a layer of amorphous selenium on their surface. When employed as electrocatalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the optimized proper surface Se-coated Ni3Se4 nanoparticles exhibit a high current density of 160 mA cm–2 at 1.6 V, achieving a high methanol-to-formate Faradaic efficiency above 97.8% and excellent stability with less than 20% current decay after an 18 h chronoamperometry test. This excellent performance is rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which unveil that the electrochemical recombination of SeOx results in a reduction of the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation of methanol during the MOR process.

Enhanced fire-prone weather under greenhouse gas warming can significantly affect local and global carbon budgets from increased fire occurrence, influencing carbon-climate feedbacks. However, the extent to which changes in fire-prone weather and associated carbon emissions can be mitigated by negative emissions remains uncertain. Here, we analyze fire weather responses in CO2 removal climate model experiments and estimate their potential carbon emissions based on an observational relationship between fire weather and fire-induced CO2 emissions. The results highlight that enhanced fire danger under global warming cannot be restored instantaneously by CO2 reduction, mainly due to atmospheric dryness maintained by climatic inertia. The exacerbated fire danger is projected to contribute to extra CO2 emissions in 68% of global regions due to the hysteresis of climate responses to CO2 levels. These findings highlight that even under global cooling from negative emissions, increased fire activity may reinforce the fire-carbon-climate feedback loop and result in further socio-economic damage. This study shows that increased fire risk under global warming may not decrease in line with CO2 reductions. The exacerbated fire danger is projected to contribute to extra CO2 emissions in 68% of the world due to the hysteresis of climate responses to CO2 levels.

An important aspect of sustainable chemistry research is the discovery of novel chemical mechanisms by which otherwise inert molecules become activated toward useful transformations by earth’s most abundant elements. Compounds involving the most abundant metal on earth, aluminum, most commonly involve AlIII ions due to their noble gas electronic configurations. Although compounds with AlI ions have also been studied, the chemistry of AlII ions is nearly unknown and may contain undiscovered reaction manifolds. Here, we report the CO2 activation chemistry of an AlII complex supported by a chelating, dianionic ligand and investigate the electronic structure details and reaction mechanisms required to access this reactivity. We found that a heterobinuclear complex, (NON)Al- FeCp(CO)2 (1), undergoes reversible Al-Fe bond homolysis at ambient conditions to reveal the [(NON)Al]·/[CpFe(CO)2]· radical pair in situ. The presence of predominantly Al-centered spin density (i.e., an AlII ion) within this radical pair was established using experiments with radical scavengers as well as electronic structure calculations. Exposure of 1 to CO2 atmosphere resulted in insertion of CO2 into the Al-Fe bond. This net 2-electron CO2 reduction process was computationally modeled using quantum chemical calculations and direct dynamics simulations, revealing that reduction involves two 1-electron steps and, thus, depends on stabilization of high-energy [CO2]· - by coordination to aluminum. This mechanism for CO2 activation is unexpected given the canonical predisposition of CO2 for multi-electron reduction processes and demonstrates the possibility of discovering new reaction profiles of earth- abundant elements in unusual oxidation states.

The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is a valuable strategy for energy storage. However, the formation of energy‐dense liquid fuels such as methanol remains rare, particularly under low‐temperature and ‐pressure conditions that can be coupled to renewable electricity sources via electrochemistry. Here, a multicatalyst system pairing an electrocatalyst with a thermal organometallic catalyst is introduced, which enables the reduction of CO2 to methanol at ambient temperature and pressure. The cascade methanol synthesis proceeds via CO2 reduction to formate by electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2’‐bipyridine), Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H‐PNP)Ir(H)3 (H‐PNP = HN(C2H4PiPr2)2). The isopropanol solvent plays several crucial roles: activating formate ion as isopropyl formate, donating hydrogen for the reduction of formate ester to methanol via transfer hydrogenation, and lowering the barrier for transfer hydrogenation through hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition to reporting a method for room‐temperature reduction of challenging ester substrates, this work provides a prototype for pairing electrochemical and thermal organometallic reactions that will guide the design and development of multicatalyst cascades.

Coordinated control of pollution and carbon reduction is an imperative choice for China’s overall transition towards sustainability. However, China’s environmental policies often treat pollutants and CO2 separately, potentially resulting in imbalanced pollution and carbon reduction. Since several cities are not only critical cities for the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) policy but also pilot cities for the Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), this study aims to examine the extent to which the policy coordination of APPCAP and ETS can influence air pollutants and CO2 emissions. Using panel data from 2011 to 2019 for China’s 231 prefecture cities, we compare the pollution and carbon reduction effects of separate and coordinated policy implementation of APPCAP and ETS via the difference-in-differences (DID) model and the causal forest model. Research shows that (1) the policy coordination of APPCAP and ETS has significantly reduced both air pollutants and CO2 emissions in dual-policy pilot cities. For non-dual pilot cities, the separate implementation of APPCAP or ETS only exerts significant unilateral effects. (2) Enhancing government supervision, weakening the relationship between government and enterprises, and raising enterprises’ green innovation capabilities are the main mechanisms through which policy coordination can significantly influence pollution and carbon reduction. (3) The combined implementation impacts of APPCAP and ETS are more evident in pollution-intensive cities and cities with weak carbon-peaking trends. Our research inspires the development of a collaborative system of pollution reduction and carbon reduction policies.    

    

## Wear Properties of Ni3Al-Ni3V-Zr-Ni5Zr Alloys under Different Atmospheres

The study examines the friction and wear properties of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloys under varying gas conditions. The alloy was tested in the presence of oxygen and carbon dioxide using a controlled atmosphere wear tester. The study revealed that the wear environmental embrittlement resulted from the diffusion of reactive atomic hydrogen into the interior of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V alloy. The addition of Zr elements decreased the proportion of Al elements on the surface of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy and reduced the proportion of H atoms produced by the chemical reaction between atmospheric water vapour and Al elements. This inhibited the environmental embrittlement and improved the performance of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy. The wear performance of Ni 5 Zr alloy is superior to that of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V. When exposed to air in an air environment, the surface of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy forms a protective Al 2 O 3 oxide film on the workpiece, resulting in a reduction of the friction coefficient and wear rate of the alloy. The wear mechanism of the alloy is mainly oxidation wear and abrasive wear. In an oxygen environment, the surface of the alloy generates a significant amount of Al 2 O 3 oxide film. The flaking of the oxide film leads to an increase in the friction coefficient and wear rate of the alloy. In a carbon dioxide environment, the surface of the alloy undergoes severe deformation, and plough lines become apparent. This is accompanied by flaking Si 3 N 4 abrasive chips adhering to the surface of the alloy, which intensifies the wear of the alloy. The primary wear mechanism is abrasive wear. Therefore, the friction coefficient and wear rate of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy in the atmosphere are optimal.

The environmental issues affecting the globe have been intensifying since the Industrial Revolution, which began in 1789, at the end of the 18th century. Technological development enabled humans to expand their capacity for exploration and extraction of natural resources, resulting in the concentration of wealth in the hands of a small group of international organizations, with the complicity of the most developed nations. The consequences of this predatory development model are evident: global warming, uncontrolled population growth, environmental degradation, and an exponential increase in poverty in various regions. This study, through a bibliographic review, seeks to identify trends and assess the possible consequences of this scenario for the lives of citizens on planet Earth. The focus is to suggest mitigating actions that can curb environmental devastation and ensure a more sustainable future, preserving human life on what was once known as the "blue planet," but which, in recent decades, has been marked by the spread of gray areas due to wildfires and increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. The drastic reduction in biodiversity, with the extinction of numerous species of fauna and flora, is an irrefutable fact that demands immediate attention.

With global warming and climate change becoming more and more serious, countries around the world have begun to pay attention to emission reduction and environmental protection, and the concept of ‘dual carbon’ has further penetrated into people's hearts, bringing new opportunities for the export of power lithium batteries from China. This paper aims to conduct a digital analysis of the export trade of the top seven countries (regions) in terms of the volume of power lithium battery trade in China, and to explore the influencing factors of the export volume of power lithium batteries from China. This paper first conducts a contour analysis based on the data fluctuations of five indicators in 32 provinces (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) from 2019 to 2021: total carbon dioxide emissions (mt), lithium iron phosphate production (10,000 tons), lithium battery electrolyte (10,000 tons), two-wheeled electric vehicles (100,000 vehicles), and lithium battery separators (10,000 tons). The final conclusion is that the ‘dual carbon’ background has a significant impact on China's power lithium battery industry. Furthermore, based on a panel data regression model, the factors affecting trade between China and the major countries (regions) exporting power lithium batteries are explored in depth. The results of the analysis found that the power generation, economic freedom, number of charging piles, population size, and per capita GDP of the exporting countries significantly affect the export volume of power lithium batteries in China. Among them, the population size and per capita GDP growth rate of the exporting countries have a negative impact, while the rest have a positive impact on the export volume of power lithium batteries in China.

The literature suggests that a country’s economic development is directly related to the efficiency of its transportation system. While the importance of a well-functioning transport system for economic growth and poverty reduction is widely acknowledged, there is limited quantitative research demonstrating this relationship. Many studies have separately applied data envelopment analysis (DEA) to analyze highways, airports, railways, and harbors. However, they have yet to analyze all modes and their relationship with economic development comprehensively. Consequently, this paper seeks to address this gap in the existing literature. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that transportation system. To this end, we employ DEA and consider a range of operational variables, including airports, railways, highways, and harbors. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between transportation efficiency and several economic and social indicators, including gross domestic product (GDP), human development index (HDI), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from the transportation system. Our findings reveal that Brazil exhibits the lowest relative efficiency when compared with the G-7 countries and South America. Additionally, it demonstrates medium efficiency within the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).

Copper tube (CT) is an indispensable material for space cooling. However, under the urgent requirements of cooling-related emission reduction, the environmental impacts and effective emission reduction strategies associated with CT manufacturing have not been investigated. This study quantified the environmental impacts of China's CT manufacturing and further explored the emission reduction potentials. Key findings are (1) almost all of the considered types of the environmental impacts of CT manufacturing are from electricity use, with melting as the largest contributing process. The gate-to-gate carbon emission intensities of inner-grooved CT, coiled CT, and straight CT are 1018, 747, and 499 kg CO2 eq, respectively. (2) The cumulative carbon emissions of China's CT manufacturing from 2022 to 2050 will reach 47.5 Mt CO2 eq in baseline scenario, of which 50% from inner-grooved CT is due to its increasing use in air conditioners. (3) About 27 Mt CO2 of the cumulative carbon emissions of CT manufacturing can be reduced, with 60% contributed by sustainable energy strategies (incl., energy efficiency improvement, energy substitution, and electricity transition). Accordingly, the impacts of other environmental issues will also be decreased by 14%–66%. This study provides an important scientific basis for the green transition of the CT industry.

Polymeric materials containing amidine motifs are of high interest due to their ability to reversibly capture and release CO2 at ambient temperature. Here we probe physical and chemical responses of styrene-based copolymers containing linear amidine motifs as functions of CO2 and inert gas exposures and temperature. A copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition "click" reaction involving N′-propargyl-N,N-dimethylacetamidine is used to modify random copolymers, resulting in an array of linear amidine motifs along the chain backbone with the amount of CO2-active amidine controlled by the copolymer composition. Through thermogravimetric measurements, we demonstrate that the amidine-functionalized copolymers efficiently capture CO2 upon exposure to a stream of CO2 (at 27 °C) and release it at a slightly elevated temperature (50 °C) when exposed to an inert gas stream (N2). In addition to displaying a maximum adsorption capacity of 22 wt % in the presence of pure CO2, the copolymers show composition-dependent direct air capture (DAC) behaviors. Small molecule analogs are used to definitively understand degradation via chemical hydrolysis of the amidine moiety, which leads to insolubility and a large reduction in CO2 adsorption capacity (1.7 wt %). Neutron vibrational spectroscopy and DFT calculations confirm that CO2 binds strongly to the amidine motif, inducing a strong bending of the CO2 molecule from its linear geometry. The coupled insights into mechanisms and behaviors of CO2 adsorption in amidine-functionalized polymers provides a foundation for future investigations of CO2-responsive polymers and soft materials to improve carbon capture and sequestration technologies.

The catalysis of CO2 to light olefins (C2=–C4=) utilizing Fe–Co bimetallic catalysts is deemed a practicable approach to counteract the excessive emission of CO2. However, a significant research gap exists in the study of manipulating the interaction between Fe–Co alloys, particularly in terms of component control. In this work, a range of bimetallic catalysts with varying Co/Fe molar ratios supported on ZrO2 were obtained through pyrolysis of mixed metal organic framework NH2-MIL-88B(Fe/Co)@UiO-66 that enables the hydrogenation of CO2 to C2=–C4=. Notably, the catalyst 10Fe1Co@ZrO2 exhibited a C2=–C4= selectivity of 45% at a CO2 conversion of 44.6%. The characterization results authenticate that, compared to the bare Fe catalyst, introducing Co significantly enhances the CO2 adsorption and conversion. Intriguingly, CoFe2O4 formed in both 10Fe1Co@ZrO2 and 5Fe1Co@ZrO2 undergoes reduction to generate CoxFey, facilitating its subsequent carbonization into the active phase χ-(CoxFe1–x)5C2 more readily during the reaction process.

With the advancement of distributed energy systems, energy sharing has emerged as a crucial trading mechanism on the demand-side, enabling participants to share self-generated energy with their neighbors through contractual agreements. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis is needed to balance the benefits among energy prosumers, given their distinct characteristics. This paper proposes a multi-energy sharing framework with flexible demand-side management based on full cooperation. We evaluate the economic and environmental performance of sharing participants, considering the impacts of different operation modes and diverse demand profiles. Cooperative game theory is employed to maximize the social welfare of all participants, with the different allocation schemes are used to distribute the cooperative surplus among stakeholders. The fairness of these schemes is assessed to ensure the feasibility and equity of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the centralized multi-energy sharing framework yields win-win outcomes for both individual and collective interests. Specifically, the total cost and carbon dioxide emissions of prosumers in the shared scenario are reduced by 13% and 16%, respectively, compared to individual operation scenarios. Moreover, thermal energy management is critically important for energy sharing. Furthermore, varying combinations of building types significantly affect cost savings and emission reductions, influencing energy sharing patterns and quantities.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of a new hybrid solvent, comprising aqueous MDEA and tetrabutylphosphonium trifluoroacetate ([TBP][TFA]), for CO2 capture and to optimize its CO2 absorption efficiency. First, this study focused on predicting the thermodynamic properties of aqueous MDEAs and [TBP][TFA] and their interaction energy with CO2 using COSMO-RS. Based on the prediction, it aligns with the principle that CO2 solubility in the MDEA-[TBP][TFA] hybrid solvent decreases as the Henry’s Law constant increases, with the interactions primarily governed by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding. The aqueous MDEA-[TBP][TFA] hybrid solvent was prepared in two steps: synthesizing and blending [TBP][TFA] with aqueous MDEAs. The formation and purity of [TBP][TFA] were confirmed through NMR, FT-IR, and Karl Fischer. The heat capacity of the hybrid solvents was lower than their aqueous MDEA solutions. The performance and optimization of CO2 capture were studied using RSM-FC-CCD design, with the optimal value obtained at 50 wt.% MDEA, 20 wt.% [TBP][TFA], 30 °C, and 30 bar (12.14 mol/kg), aligning with COSMO-RS predictions. A 26% reduction in the heat capacity was achieved with the optimal ratio (wt.%) of the hybrid solvent. These findings suggest that the aqueous MDEA-[TBP][TFA] hybrid solvent is a promising alternative for CO2 capture, providing a high removal capacity and lower heat capacity for more efficient regeneration compared to commercial aqueous MDEA solutions.

Background/Objectives: This study focused on a group of 22 elite male mountain runners from Brazil (average age of 35.9 ± 6.5 years) with the objective of exploring the possible roles of the ACTN3 R577X, ACE I/D, and CK MM A/G NcoI genetic variants in shaping electrochemical profiles and maintaining acid-base homeostasis during a 105-km ultramarathon. Methods: Genotyping for each polymorphism (ACTN3: RR, RX, XX; ACE: DD, ID, II; CK MM: AA, AG, GG) was conducted using PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), and saliva samples were used to obtain DNA. Analyses of electrochemical and acid-base disturbances were performed in real time. Results: It was observed that athletes who completed the race in less time had lower calcium concentrations (Rs = 0.35; p = 0.016). Athletes who completed the race faster had lower calcium concentrations (Rs = 0.35; p = 0.016). Pre-race, the RX genotype showed a 14.19% reduction in potassium levels compared to RR (p = 0.01). The GG genotype showed potassium levels 19.36% higher than AA (p = 0.01) and a 6.11% increase in hematocrit values compared to AA (p = 0.03). Additionally, the AG genotype exhibited hematocrit values 5.44% higher than AA (p = 0.03). Post-race, the XX genotype demonstrated higher hematocrit values compared to RX, with an increase of 8.92% (p = 0.03). The II genotype showed a 0.27% increase in pH compared to ID (p = 0.02) and a 20.42% reduction in carbon dioxide levels (p = 0.01). Conclusions: The findings emphasize the impact of the examined polymorphisms on the modulation of electrochemical factors and the maintenance of acid-base equilibrium in athletes during 105 km ultramarathons.

The increased interest nowadays in quantitative assessment of soil respiration is largely due to studies of the role of various terrestrial ecosystems in changing the concentration of the most important greenhouse gas, CO2, in the atmosphere. The review considers methodological aspects of determining the actual CO2 emission from soils using chamber and absorption methods, as well as the use of the obtained data to assess the carbon balance in soils. Successful development of this topic will allow to promptly get an answer to the main question of this pressing environmental issue: what is the soil of this or that ecosystem for atmospheric CO2 – a net source or a net sink? The article analyzes the results of works devoted to comparative determination of CO2 emission from soils by these methods. It is shown that the widespread opinion about obtaining underreported data by absorption method is often based on studies in which the basic principles of the method were violated. It is concluded that it is necessary to carry out in-depth comparative studies on determination of average daily indicators of CO2 emission from soil by chamber and absorption methods. It is recognized that, regardless of the method, the main problem in using CO2 production data to estimate soil C balance is the adequate partitioning of total respiration into heterotrophic and autotrophic components, the ratio between which varies widely depending on soil and vegetation conditions. Due to imperfection and labor intensity of existing methods, this division can cause significant errors in determining the annual mineralization of soil organic matter. To reduce them, the approach to determination of mineralization losses of CO2 in bare fallow soils is considered. It is natural for soils of agrocenoses, but as a methodological technique can probably be used in natural grass ecosystems as well. Reduction of errors can be ensured due to the fact that differences in actual mineralization of organic matter in bare fallow and plant-occupied soils are several times less than changes in the ratio between heterotrophic and autotrophic components of soil respiration in different biogeocenoses.

Chemical process intensification has attracted extensive interest of scholars. Distillation, as a high energy consumption industry, is in urgent need of energy saving and CO2 emissions reduction by means of process intensification. In this paper, isobutanol and p-xylene azeotrope was separated by pressure swing distillation (PSD). Combined with process integration method, four heat integration PSD processes including partial heat integration PSD (PHI-PSD), enhanced partial heat integration PSD (EPHI-PSD), full heat integration PSD (FHI-PSD), and enhanced full heat integration PSD (EFHI-PSD) were designed and optimized through sequential iterative procedure. The total annual cost (TAC), CO2 emissions, and thermodynamic efficiency were calculated and compared. By comparing relevant data, it is found that EPHI-PSD process has obvious advantages in terms of economic, thermodynamic efficiency, and environmental benefits. Specifically, comparing with the basic PSD process, thermodynamic efficiency of EPHI-PSD process is improved by 97.8% while TAC and CO2 emissions are decreased by 37.0% and 50.1%, respectively.

The primary objective of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) applications in various natural and engineered porous materials is to achieve a stable and planar CO2 displacement front, thereby suppressing viscous fingering. A stable front can ensure uniform and exhaustive CO2 mineralization throughout a reactive medium (i.e., mineral carbonation). Drawing inspiration from experimental observations of CO2 flooding into cores of portland cement-based materials, we examine the stability of such systems. Under these conditions, the injected CO2 continuously dissolves into the resident water phase, which becomes chemically disequilibrated with the solid minerals and leads to mineral carbonation on the wetted surfaces. Focusing on the early injection time allows us to reduce the complex multiphysical problem to a simple two-phase flow scenario of immiscible displacement with a CO2 interfacial flux sink. The formulated equations are investigated using numerical simulations and linear stability analysis, which results in a closed-form criterion, and provide fundamental insights into system stability. Overall, the results show that several effects combine to stabilize the system, including the sink effect, which acts to eliminate instability; the reduction in flow velocity along the flow path, which limits flow focusing; and the relative increase in stabilizing capillary forces. Therefore, if the system is stable at early stages, it will likely remain stable later on. Finally, this research demonstrates the use of theory to simplify complex problems and shows that even when flow is inherently coupled, the state of systems can often be determined from fluid stability alone.

Fine-tuning transformer-based deep learning models is currently at the forefront of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, fine-tuning these transformers for specific tasks, especially when dealing with ever-expanding volumes of data, constant retraining requirements, and budget constraints, can be computationally and financially costly, requiring substantial energy consumption and contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. This article focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on instance selection (IS) – a range of document filtering techniques designed to select the most representative documents for the sake of training. The objective is to either maintain or enhance classification effectiveness while reducing the overall training (fine-tuning) total processing time. In our prior research, we introduced the E2SC framework, a redundancy-oriented IS method focused on transformers and large datasets – currently the state-of-the-art in IS. Nonetheless, important research questions remained unanswered in our previous work, mostly due to E2SC's sole emphasis on redundancy. In this article, we take our research a step further by proposing biO-IS – an extended bi - ob jective i nstance s election solution, a novel IS framework aimed at simultaneously removing redundant and noisy instances from the training. biO-IS estimates redundancy based on scalable, fast, and calibrated weak classifiers and captures noise with the support of a new entropy-based step. We also propose a novel iterative process to estimate near-optimum reduction rates for both steps. Our extended solution is able to reduce the training sets by 41% on average (up to 60%) while maintaining the effectiveness in all tested datasets, with speedup gains of 1.67 on average (up to 2.46x). No other baseline, not even our previous SOTA solution, was capable of achieving results with this level of quality, considering the tradeoff among training reduction, effectiveness, and speedup.

CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over Cu-based catalysts faces challenges such as low methanol selectivity and poor stability. Here, we report a series of CuIn bimetallic catalysts with different Cu/In ratios prepared by the coprecipitation method. Among them, the methanol selectivity of Cu25In75 reaches as high as 92.5% at 200 °C and 64.5% at 260 °C, which is 1.3 times and 1.9 times higher than that of the commercial catalyst at 200 and 260 °C, respectively. Moreover, Cu25In75 exhibits high stability for 200 h time-on-stream at 260 °C. The high selectivity originates from a strong interaction between Cu species and In2O3–x with oxygen vacancies. On the interface between Cu and In2O3–x, dispersed Cu is the main contributor to the activation and dissociation of H2, while the oxygen vacancies in In2O3 adsorb and activate CO2. During the reaction, the abundance of hydrogen facilitates the reduction of the In2O3 surface, promoting the generation of surface oxygen vacancies and providing the necessary hydrogen for the hydrogenation reaction. Our research unveils a promising synergistic strategy for the rational design and application of Cu-based catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation, offering avenues for further exploration and advancement in this field.

The transition towards more sustainable packaging calls for improving our ability to predict, control, and inhibit microbial growth. Despite the importance of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) in food preservation, the exact relations between MAP gases (CO2, O2, N2) and microbial behavior are still poorly understood. Addressing this major knowledge gap requires a specific infrastructure to gain precise control over the gas composition during storage time. Thus, this study aimed at developing and validating an innovative gas-washing bottle incubation system (GBIS) with an adapted pH methodology for monitoring microbial growth in liquid media under different well-controlled conditions. Listeria monocytogenes—a psychrotrophic pathogen raising severe safety concerns under refrigerated conditions—was used as a representative microorganism. The results showed that daily gas flushing effectively dominated overnight headspace variations, allowing incubating L. monocytogenes and daily sampling for 13 days under static conditions. Subsequently, storage experiments were performed at 4 °C under stable pH and anaerobic conditions with different CO2 levels (20–40–60%). Significant growth reduction was observed from 6.0 to 4.8 log CFU/mL as CO2 increased from 20% (pH = 6.7) to 60% (pH = 6.2) (p ≤ 0.05). Overall, GBIS shows great potential in data collection for predictive modeling and, consecutively, for boosting decision-making in the food packaging sector.

A global clean energy transition is required for achieving ambitious climate goals and ensuring sustainable development. While technological advancements are crucial, they are not sufficient on their own to meet Paris Agreement (PA) climate targets. Integrating lifestyle changes, particularly in sectors such as transport and residential use of energy, into climate policies and energy modeling framework is gaining recognition in energy transition research. This study explores the impact of lifestyle changes on the global energy system and CO2 emissions using the PROMETHEUS model, an advanced energy–economy–environment system model. In this research we present scenarios in which lifestyle changes, such as reduced private car use and increased adoption of public transport and energy-savings behavior in households, are gradually introduced and complement technological and policy measures within the energy transition framework. We explore the impacts of scenarios with different levels of climate policies and lifestyle changes to evaluate the effects of various behavioral shifts on global energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Results show that even under current climate policies, lifestyle changes can reduce global energy demand by 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2050. When combined with ambitious decarbonization policies, the reductions are much more significant, leading to a 35% reduction by 2050 compared to the baseline scenario. Overall, the findings suggest that lifestyle changes, when effectively integrated with climate policy measures, can reduce energy demand and carbon emissions, alleviate the pressure on energy supply, and reduce the cost burden for energy producers and consumers.

ABSTRACT Edible insects have gained increased attention as the important and sustainable source of nutrients for both human and animal consumption due to their rich content of protein, oil, fiber (as chitin), vitamins, and minerals. This study focuses on examining the effects of advanced pretreatments and oil extraction methods from prominent edible insect species commercially cultivated in Thailand, namely the house cricket ( Acheta domesticus ), black soldier fly larvae ( Hermetia illucens ), and silkworm ( Bombxy mori ). The raw insect samples underwent pretreatment using high pressure processing (HPP) at 200–600 MPa for 5 min or ultrasonication (UL) at 37 kHz for 5–15 min, followed by dehydration and extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO 2 ) or solvent extraction. The study revealed that HPP significantly reduced the initial microbial load of all edible insects by 6–8 log cycles, while UL showed a slight effect on microbial reduction. Additionally, pretreatments notably improved the oil extraction yield of most samples by disrupting the integrity of the cell membrane, facilitating the release of oils. The extracted edible insect oils were rich in unsaturated fatty acids, omega 3, 6, and 9, making them suitable for various applications such as cosmetics, food, and feed additives. Furthermore, the protein meals obtained as a residue after oil removal were identified as potential meat alternatives or replacements in food or feed formulations. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of edible insects as a sustainable source of oil and protein, highlighting the significance of pretreatments and extraction methods in maximizing their utility for various applications in the food, cosmetic, and feed industries.    

    

## Preparation and characterization of reactive extrusion modified PLA/ABS blends and its foams

The current thesis takes place within the context of the projects MAT2016-80045-R "Aplicaciones industriales de compuestos y mezclas basados en REX-PLA" and the project "PLAIABS Blends: Recydability and weight reduction" financially supported by the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad of the Spanis h Government and SEAT res pectively. The main objective was to improve the properties of poly lactic acid (PLA) in arder to make it suitable for long-lasting applications where emphasis is de\Qted to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and the renewable raw materiaIs content. Among the different routes to enhance PLA properties, blending was used, as it is easily scalable bythe industry. Dueto its good balance of properties, ABS was considered a suitable polymer to be used together with PLA However, dueto their immiscibili ty, a coupling agent (ABS-g -MAH) was introduced. Apart of brittl ness, another PLA problem is its relatively easy degradation during process ing. Previous studies of the Group indicated that PLAdegradation could be limited using a multi epoxide reactive agent that a110ids the loss in molecular weight and increases the PLA melt visc osity, which, on the other hand, facilitates processing . Moreover, it was believed that the unreacted chain extender epoxide groups could also form covalent bonding with the coupling agent improving ABS and PLA compatibility. Using foams both the total weight and carbon dioxide generation of components can be diminished. For these reasons, different techniques for physicallyfoaming the blends either during injection (MuCell) or through a batch process were object of research. The effect of the above mentioned chain extender and the effect of a tale filler on the batch-foaming behavior of PLAwas studied. The first step of the research consisted in obtained the base materiaIs by reactive extrusion (REX) at a pilot plant seale (50 kg.). A conventional injection molding process was then employed to obtain standard samples that were used for the thermo­ mechanical characterization ofthe blends. The thermal stabilitywas studied bythe Kissinger 's method. The results showed that it was improved when the amount of ABS-g-MAH was increased. From the DSC analysis, it was found that in comparison to more perfect REX-PLA structures, crystals with a smaller lamellar thickness were formed in the blends. The differences in crystallinitywere small and do not influence the mechanical properties. The presence of ABS in the compositions led to a decrease ofthe blend 's storage modulus. Nonetheless, the ABS phase was found to playthe role of scaffold for the PLA phase that can undergo re­ crystallization, being thus able to support a certain amount of loading during heating. The physical foaming ofthe different injected blends was difficult to be achieved. The optimization ofthe foaming conditions required several triaIs and a large quantityof material. As the amount of each blend was limited, only a partial number of the proposed experiments were possible. The obtained blends contained a few large cells as well as a certain population of small sized cells. Although a complete micro-cellular structure was not achieved, the obtained one was similar to that of previous works found in literature. lt was, however, demonstrated that this technique can be used byindustryto generate lighter components. Batch foaming using CO2 in supercritical conditions resulted in successful foams with cell sizes below 100 microns and very high cell densi ties. In comparison to PLA, dueto its higher viscosity and melt resistance, using REX-PLA resulted in improved level offoaming which prevents from cell coalescence and collapse. The presence of ABS in the blends allowed broadening the range of pressure and temperatures in which foams can be produced. Tale was found to actas a nucleating agent leading to smaller cell sizes and higher cell densities in the foamed blends. La presente tesis se enmarca en los proyectos MAT2016-80045-R "Aplicac iones industriales de compuestos y basados en REX-PLA'' y "PLA / ABS Blends: Reciclabilidad y reducción de peso" que han sido subvencionados por el Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad del Gobierno de España y SEAT respectivamente. El objetivo principal que se persigue es mejorar las propiedades del ácido poliláctico (PLA) de forma que pueda emplearse en aplicaciones de larga duración, donde la reducción de las emisiones de dióxido de carbono y el contenido de materias primas renovables toma mayor importancia con respecto a la biodegradabilidad . Entre las diferentes rutas para mejorar las propiedades del PLA se seleccionado el mezclado ya que es facilmente reproducible por la industria. Debido a su buen equilibrio de propiedades, el ABS se consideró una opción adecuada para ser utilizado junto con PLA si bien fue necesario introducir un compatibilizante . Aparte de la fragilidad , el PLA puede degradar durante su procesado . En estudios previos del Grupo de investigación se ha visto que dicha degradación puede limitarse utilizando un agente reactivo multiepóxido que limita la pérdida de peso molecular y aumenta la viscosidad del PLA. Además, los grupos epóxido remanentes se cree que pueden ser capaces de reaccionar con el agente de acoplamiento mejorando así la compatibilidad. La espumación es un método que permite disminuir tanto el peso como la huella de carbono de un cierto componentes. Por estas razones , se estudiaron diferentes técnicas para espumar físicamente las mezclas , bien durante la inyección (MuCell) o bien usando un proceso discontinuo . En este sentido se estudió el efecto del extensor de cadena mencionado así como el efecto del talco durante la espumación discontinua. El primer paso de la investigación consistió en obtener los materiales base, por extrusión reactiva (REX) a nivel de planta piloto (50 kg.) . Posteriormente se empleó la inyección convencional para obtener muestras para la caracterización termomecánica de las mezclas. La estabilidad térmica se estudió mediante el método de Kissinger. Los resultados mostraron el incremento de ABS-g-MAH contribuye a una may0r estabilidad. A través de DSC, se vió que en las mezclas se formaron cristales con un espesor !amelar más pequeño en comparación con el REX-PLA Las diferencias en cristalinidad fueron pequeñas y no influyeron en las propiedades mecánicas. La presencia de ABS en las mezclas condujo a una disminución del módulo de almacenamiento. No obstante, se encontró que la fase ABS juega el papel de andamio para la fase PLAque puede sufrir recristalización durante el calentamiento, pudiendo así soportar una cierta cantidad de esfuerzo. La espumación física de las diferentes mezclas inyectadas fue difícil de conseguir. La optimización de las condiciones requirió divserdas pruebas yel empleo de una gran cantidad de material. Como la cantidad de cada mezcla era limitada, solo fue posible realizar una parte de los experimentos propuestos . No obstante lo anterior, las piezas inyectadas y espumadas contenían algunas celdas grandes , así como una cierta población de células de pequeño tamaño. Aunque no se logró una estructura microcelular completa, la obtenida fue similar a la de trabajos previos encontrados en la literatura. Sin embargo, se ha demostrado que esta técnica puede ser utilizada para generar componentes aligerados . La formación de espuma en batch usando CO2 dio como resultado espumas con tamaños de celda por debajo de 100 micras y densidades de celda muy altas. En comparación con el PLA, el REX-PLA resultó en un may0r nivel de es pum ación debido a su mayor viscosidad y resistencia en fundido, lo que evitó la coalescencia y el colapso celular. La presencia de ABS en las mezclas permitió asimismo ampliar el rango de presiones y temperaturas en las que se pueden producir las espumas. Se descubrió que Tale actúa como un agente nucleante que conduce a tamaños celulares más pequeños y densidades celulares más altas en las mezclas espumadas.

Abstract. Inland saline lakes play a key role in the global carbon cycle, acting as dynamic zones for atmospheric carbon exchange and storage. Given the global decline of saline lakes and the expected increase of periods of drought in a climate change scenario, changes in their potential capacity to uptake or emit atmospheric carbon are expected. Here, we conducted continuous measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes at the ecosystem scale in an endorheic saline lake of the Mediterranean region over nearly 2 years. Our focus was on determining net CO2 and CH4 exchanges with the atmosphere under both dry and flooded conditions, using the eddy covariance (EC) method. We coupled greenhouse gas flux measurements with water storage and analysed meteorological variables like air temperature and radiation, known to influence carbon fluxes in lakes. This extensive data integration enabled the projection of the net carbon flux over time, accounting for both dry and wet conditions on an interannual scale. We found that the system acts as a substantial carbon sink by absorbing atmospheric CO2 under wet conditions. In years with prolonged water storage, it is predicted that the lake's CO2 assimilation capacity can surpass 0.7 kg C m2 annually. Conversely, during extended drought years, a reduction in CO2 uptake capacity of more than 80 % is expected. Regarding CH4, we measured uptake rates that exceeded those of well-aerated soils such as forest soils or grasslands, reaching values of 0.2 µmol m−2 s−1. Additionally, we observed that CH4 uptake during dry conditions was nearly double that of wet conditions. However, the absence of continuous data prevented us from correlating CH4 uptake processes with potential environmental predictors. Our study challenges the widespread notion that wetlands are universally greenhouse gas emitters, highlighting the significant role that endorheic saline lakes can play as a natural sink of atmospheric carbon. However, our work also underscores the vulnerability of these ecosystem services in the current climate change scenario, where drought episodes are expected to become more frequent and intense in the coming years.

The intensive use of fossil fuels has led to a significant increase in air pollution, which negatively affects human health and the environment. Fly ash (FA), a byproduct of coal combustion, has great potential as an adsorbent for hazardous gas pollutants due to its physical and chemical properties. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of fly ash as an adsorbent in reducing gas pollutants such as CO2, SO2, and NO2, as well as to examine the influence of temperature and material characteristics on adsorption capacity. The results indicate that the maximum adsorption capacity for each gas pollutant is achieved at different temperatures, fly ash demonstrating the highest performance at 150 °C for CO2 adsorption, achieving an efficiency of 94.7%. For SO2 and NO2, the optimum temperatures are 200 °C, with efficiencies of 72.17% and 100%, respectively. This study also emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate characteristics of the adsorbent material to enhance adsorption efficiency. This finding has the potential to support the development of more efficient and sustainable air pollution reduction technologies in the future, by utilizing industrial waste such as fly ash as an innovative solution.

The architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) sector exerts a considerable influence on energy consumption and CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere, making a notable contribution to climate change. It is therefore imperative that energy efficiency in buildings is prioritized in order to reduce environmental impacts and meet the targets set out in the European 2030 Agenda. In this context, renewable energy communities (RECs) have the potential to play an important role, promoting the use of renewable energy at the local level, optimizing energy management, and reducing consumption by sharing resources and advanced technologies. This paper introduces an open tool (OT) designed for the configuration of energy systems dedicated to RECs. The OT considers several inputs, including thermal and electrical loads, energy consumption, the type of building, surface area, and population size. The OT employs artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine learning (ML) techniques to generate forecast optimized scenarios for the sizing of photovoltaic systems, thermal, and electrical storage, and the estimation of CO2 emission reductions. The OT features a user-friendly interface, enabling even non-experts to obtain comprehensive configurations for RECs, aiming to accelerate the transition toward sustainable and efficient district energy systems, driving positive environmental impact and fostering a greener future for communities and cities.

This article is dedicated to the issues of formulating a “green” investment policy. The research aims to analyze, systematize, and improve the existing theoretical and methodological framework concerning the development of the “green” economy in Ukraine and develop a mechanism for formulating a “green” investment policy. The development of the “green” economy in Ukraine and its significance for achieving sustainable economic development are examined. A comprehensive analysis of the main aspects influencing the country’s ecological economic formation is presented, including carbon dioxide emissions, transformational mechanisms for the transition, and the state of ecological innovation implementation. It is substantiated that developing the “green” economy is crucial in the transition to sustainable economic development, which considers ecological, social, and economic aspects. The results of expert evaluations are provided, indicating some progress in developing the “green” economy from 2021 to 2023 despite the country’s military conflict’s negative consequences. It is found that one of the critical tools for stimulating the development of the “green” economy is environmental taxes, which contribute to pollution reduction and foster corporate responsibility. The research also revealed that while the environmental tax in Ukraine has potential, it still occupies a minor share of the tax revenue structure, indicating the need to improve its implementation mechanisms. The study identified that the market for “green” investments is actively developing; however, obstacles exist, such as the lack of clear standards and criteria for defining “green” projects and a high level of risk associated with investing in advanced ecological technologies. A mechanism for formulating a “green” investment policy is proposed. It is determined that implementing the “green” investment policy in Ukraine requires a systematic approach and coordinated efforts from many stakeholders in the process, including government bodies, private companies, and non-governmental organizations. Developing an investment policy that stimulates investments in environmentally friendly technologies is also essential. It is noted that to achieve the goals of developing a “green” economy in Ukraine, it is necessary to overcome existing barriers and ensure stability and transparency in the investment environment. Keywords: green economy, green policy, green investments, environmental taxes, sustainable development.

To achieve carbon neutrality in China’s fossil energy sector, saline aquifer CO2 geological storage has become a critical strategy. As research into carbon reduction and storage potential evaluation advances across various geological scales, the need arises for consolidating key CO2 storage cases and establishing a standardized classification system and evaluation methodology. This paper provides a comprehensive review of notable CO2 storage projects in saline aquifers, covering aspects such as project overviews, structural and reservoir characteristics, caprock integrity, and seismic monitoring protocols. Drawing on insights from mineral and oil and gas exploration, as well as international methods, this paper outlines the stages and potential levels of saline aquifer storage in China. It proposes an evaluation framework with formulas and reference values for key coefficients. The study includes successful global projects, such as Sleipner and Snøhvit in Norway, In Salah in Algeria, and Shenhua in China’s Ordos Basin, which provide valuable insights for long-term carbon capture and storage (CCS). By examining geological characteristics, injection, and monitoring protocols in these projects, this paper analyzes how geological features impact CO2 storage outcomes. For example, the Sleipner project’s success is linked to its straightforward structure, favorable reservoir properties, and stable caprock, while Snøhvit illustrates diverse structural suitability, and In Salah demonstrates the influence of fractures on storage efficacy. CO2 storage activities are segmented into four stages—survey, investigation, exploration, and injection—and are further categorized by storage potential: geological, technical, techno-economic, and engineering capacities. This study also presents evaluation levels (prediction, control, technically recoverable, and engineering) that support effective reservoir selection, potential classification, and calculations considering factors like reservoir stability and sealing efficacy. Depending on application needs, volumetric or mechanistic methods are recommended, with precise determination of geological, displacement, and cost coefficients. For China, a dynamic evaluation mechanism characterized by multi-scale, tiered approaches and increasing precision over time is essential for robust storage potential assessment. The levels and methods outlined here serve as a scientific foundation for regional and stage-based comparisons, guiding engineering approvals and underground space management. To align with practical engineering demands, ongoing innovation through laboratory experiments, simulations, and field practice is crucial, supporting continual refinement of formulas and key parameter determinations.

Due to its distinctive structure and unique physicochemical properties, gallium nitride (GaN) has been considered a prospective candidate for lithium storage materials. However, its inferior conductivity and unsatisfactory cycle performance hinder the further application of GaN as a next-generation anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To address this, cobalt (Co)-doped GaN (Co-GaN) nanowires have been designed and synthesized by utilizing the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy. The structural characterizations indicate that the doped Co elements in the GaN nanowires exist as Co2+ rather than metallic Co. The Co2+ prominently promotes electrical conductivity and ion transfer efficiency in GaN. The cycling capacity of Co-GaN reached up to 495.1 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. After 500 cycles at 10 A g−1, excellent cycling capacity remained at 276.6 mA h g−1. The intimate contact between Co-GaN nanowires and carbon paper enhances the conductivity of the composite. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further illustrated that Co substitution changed the electron configuration in the GaN, which led to enhancement of the electron transfer efficiency and a reduction in the ion diffusion barrier on the Co-GaN electrode. This doping design boosts the lithium-ion storage performance of GaN as an advanced material in lithium-ion battery anodes and in other electrochemical applications.

Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement is recognized as an environmentally friendly alternative to Portland cement (PC) due to its lower carbon footprint and energy requirements. However, traditional CSA cement production faces significant obstacles, including the high cost and regionally constrained availability of bauxite, a key raw material. Utilizing alternative materials in the production process offers a viable approach to address these limitations. This study evaluated the environmental performance of three laboratory-synthesized CSA cements using alternative raw materials sourced through an industrial symbiosis framework. A comparative assessment with PC was conducted, focusing on energy consumption and CO2 emissions as key environmental performance indicators. The environmental impact of the CSA cements was analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations, a robust statistical approach based on data for the constituent raw materials. This method provides a practical alternative to a full life cycle assessment (LCA) when comprehensive data are not available. The results demonstrate that the CSA cements have significantly lower environmental impacts compared to PC, achieving energy savings of 13–16% and CO2 emission reductions of 35–48%. These results emphasize the potential of industrial symbiosis to enable more sustainable CSA cement production while addressing raw material constraints. In addition, this approach highlights the wider applicability of industrial symbiosis frameworks in the construction industry, contributing to a zero-waste future and supporting global climate goals.

Accurate estimation of carbon removal by terrestrial ecosystems and oceans is crucial to the success of global carbon mitigation initiatives. The emergence of multi-source CO2 observations offers prospects for an improved assessment of carbon fluxes. However, the utility of these diverse observations has been limited by their heterogeneity, leading to much variation in estimated carbon fluxes. To harvest the diverse data types, this paper develops a multi-observation carbon assimilation system (MCAS), which simultaneously integrates both satellite and ground-based observations. MCAS modifies the ensemble Kalman filter to apply different inflation factors to different types of observation errors, addressing the heterogeneity between satellite and in situ data. In commonly used independent validation datasets, the carbon flux derived from MCAS outperformed those obtained from a single source, demonstrating a 20% reduction in error compared to existing carbon flux products. We use MCAS to conduct ecosystem and ocean carbon flux inversion for the period of 2016–2020, which reveals that the 5-year average global net terrestrial and ocean sink was 1.84 ± 0.60 and 2.74 ± 0.49 petagrams, absorbing approximately 47% of human-caused CO2 emissions together, which were consistent with the global carbon project estimates of 1.82 and 2.66 petagrams. All these facts suggest MCAS is a better methodology than those for assimilating single-source observation only.

As awareness of the impact of anthropogenic activities on climate change increases, the concepts of durability, resilience, and sustainability in concrete tend to be adopted more seriously in the concrete construction industry. In this sense, one of the concrete technologies that began in the 1980s and that significantly contributes to maximize the beneficial effect on all these concepts are the ultra-high-performance concretes, a very attractive technology because it presents ultra-high strength and durability performances far superior to those of conventional concretes, a performance that is leading to a permanent increased demand. However, the development of these concretes has been widely criticized due to their high ecological impact, which is mainly attributable to the high cement dosages required for their production (800–1000 kg/m3). To address this criticism in a comprehensive manner and thereby reduce the embodied carbon attributable exclusively to the material, this research was oriented to determine the effect of an industrial by-product of vitrified clay, as a partial or total substitution for cement, silica fume, and limestone aggregate, on the compressive strength, flexural toughness, and embodied CO2. For the UHPC’s evaluated in this work with a dosage of 2% by volume of steel micro-fibers, the results evidence the feasibility that the following substitutions by mass: 30% of the Portland cement, 100% of the silica fume, and 30% of the limestone aggregate and powder, do not detract the fresh stage, the compressive strength, the static modulus of elasticity, and the flexural strength, leading to significant reductions of the embodied CO2.

Telework has become a commonly employed modality in companies and public institutions to perform work activities, mainly due to the confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, even before the pandemic, telework was recommended to mitigate some of the adverse effects of human activity on the environment, reduce the use of resources in companies, combat traffic congestion, and affect the quality of life of workers. The present article is exploratory and aims to analyze the workers' perspective on telework and its relation to the environment. We proceeded to apply a survey, using a poll, to more than 200 people;subsequently, a descriptive statistics analysis was carried out in order to identify patterns or classifications among different groups of workers. Teleworking offers several perceived advantages, one of which is the significant reduction in commuting and fuel consumption. A staggering 90.91% of teleworkers acknowledge this reduction in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this work modality enables companies to curb their electricity consumption and use of air conditioning, thereby benefiting the environment. From an environmental standpoint, telework can contribute to sustainable development by reducing emissions and energy consumption. This positive impact aligns with the country's decarbonization goals and can also enhance people's quality of life.

This study examines methods to lessen the environmental consequences of global CO2 emissions from the hard-to-abate transport sector. The paper analyzed historical and projected trends in global CO2 emissions from the hard-to-abate transport industry under two scenarios: the stated policy scenario (STEPS) and the announced pledged scenario (APS). The study covered the historical period from 2010 to 2022 and projected emissions up to 2050. The analysis revealed that the compound annual growth rate (CAAGR) of STEP exceeded that of APS in 2030 and 2050 for challenging emissions from heavy- duty vehicles, aircraft, and shipping when compared to the baseline year of 2022. The aviation industry has a higher CAAGR of 5.3% and 2.5% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, compared to heavy-duty vehicles at 1.6% and 0.9% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, and shipping at 0.7% and 0.9% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, under STEPS. Under the APS scenario, shipping showed a negative CAAGR of -0.8% and -2.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, and 0.4% and -1.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, for heavy-duty trucks. In comparison, the aviation industry had CAAGRs of 4.5% and 0.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively. The data shows that the aviation industry is expected to see a far greater CAAGR in emissions than heavy-duty vehicles and shipping in both STEPS and APS scenarios. Targeted efforts are necessary to mitigate the environmental effects of air travel in the upcoming decades. The paper also examined 56 publicly traded international transportation companies and their corresponding carbon emission targets. Only seven companies, or 12.5%, have established goals for reducing emissions from 2023 to 2050; 10 companies, accounting for 17.9%, have committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040 to 2060; five corporations, representing 8.9%, have set targets for reducing emission intensity from 2025 to 2034; and 34 global corporations, making up 60.7%, have committed to achieving net zero emissions between 2040 and 2050. Despite some progress in setting emission reduction targets in the air travel industry, many companies still need to set carbon footprint reduction goals.

Carbonation technology using MgO and CO2 has been considered a rapid, effective, and environmentally friendly method for improving weak soils, mainly applied in shallow foundation treatments. This study introduced a novel MgO-carbonated composite pile (MCP) technique developed by injecting CO2 through a gas-permeable pipe pile into a MgO-mixing column for carbonation and solidification and its applications in weak subgrade treatments. Several field tests were carried out to study the characteristics of MCP as well as the performance of the MCP-reinforced foundations, including carbonation reaction temperature monitoring, pore-water pressure monitoring, standard penetration tests (SPT), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests, static load tests, and subgrade deformation monitoring. Results showed vigorous and uniform carbonation within the MgO-mixing column, confirming the feasibility of constructing large-diameter MgO-mixing columns. The distribution, evolution, and affected zone of excess pore-water pressure induced by MCP installation were determined. The MCP exhibited good pile quality, with average SPT-N and UCS values of 39 and 1021 kPa, respectively. MCP’s bearing capacity was superior to pre-stressed high-strength concrete pipe piles, with ultimate vertical and lateral bearing capacities of 1920 kN and 119 kN, respectively. The MCP-reinforced foundation exhibited a small settlement of 54.5 mm under embankment loads. Life cycle assessment indicated significant carbon reduction benefits for MCP, with 44.7% lower carbon emissions compared to traditional composite piles.

The production of cement is responsible for 7% of worldwide CO2 emissions, leading to environmental threats and harm to ecosystems. Given the significant expenses involved and the necessity for substitutes such as biochar, there is a critical focus on investigating supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) to partially substitute traditional materials. The use of biochar as a concrete admixture is becoming more popular, and it has been investigated as a building material. Biochar is a solid organic residue produced by the pyrolysis of biomass. The experiment aimed to determine the mechanical characteristics of biochar-containing concrete using a concrete grade M20, cube moulds of dimension 100mm x 100mm x 100mm; cylinder moulds of 100mm x 200mm and beam formwork of dimension 150mm x 150mm x 1000mm were used to cast the control concrete sample and concrete containing varying percentages of biochar. Finite element analysis was also carried out using the ABAQUS program, utilizing concrete properties discovered through experimental study. The numerical and experimental study revealed that elevating the proportion of biochar in concrete led to about 17% decrease in compressive strength, 40% reduction in tensile strength, and about 25% reduction in the flexural strength of concrete beams. Both numerical and experimental approaches proved successful in assessing the influence of biochar on concrete.

Abstract The Russian military aggression against Ukraine has had significant global impacts on energy security, economy and geopolitics. The 2022 global energy crisis raises questions about how the war affects the energy transition and global climate policy. However, there are limited studies that incorporate its effects into self-consistent projections of alternative scenarios. This scenario study uses two leading macro-economic models and one integrated assessment model to assess how the war in Ukraine and its direct implications - trade restrictions and rising energy prices - affect economies, energy supply and demand trends, emissions and the feasibility of climate policies. The models consistently project that the disruptive responses to the war lead to a shift from fossil fuels (notably natural gas) to renewable energy and a consequent CO2 emission reduction of about 1%-5%, in the period up to 2050, both for the European Union and globally. However, projections differ across models in terms of sectoral and regional contributions to emission reductions. The results are found to be highly sensitive to the expected, yet uncertain persistence of higher fossil energy prices due to the war, which depends on the duration of the conflict, the disruption of global energy supplies and the response of other major fossil fuel exporters.

Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high‐value product with less energy consumption. Two‐dimensional conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (2D c‐MOFs), comprising square‐planar metal‐coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c‐MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm‐2, significantly reducing the overall water‐electrolysis‐voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4>CoO4>Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non‐noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high‐performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.

The problems related to environmental issues have motivated extensive research on environmentally friendly materials. The built environment is responsible for high primary energy use and more of energy related CO2 emissions. However, it is important to develop low-embodied energy, carbon-negative, sustainable construction materials to replace conventional products. In this context, agricultural wastes are the excellent alternative materials to substitute mineral aggregates because they are widespread and easily accessible. The application of these elements is interesting as regards the recycling of the vegetable particles, since these are easily available and renewable low-cost raw materials, and has advantage for economy and environment. However, the reduction of energy consumption in construction, production of thermal insulation materials, and the solution of environmental problems by recycling waste are becoming greater problems. Various types of agriculture waste, after being processed, have been used as particles in concrete or mortars. These materials display lower density and have several potential applications such as acoustic and thermal insulation, fire resistance cladding…etc. The study reported in this paper was undertaken to investigate the physico-mechanical properties of cellular materials based on flax particles, in order to produce usable materials in cellular concrete applications. The material produced containing different volumes of flax particles (0V (control mortar), 1V, and 2V) was lightened by creating a porous structure in the matrix through a chemical reaction between aluminium powder and free lime. A study conducted on hardened material properties has indicated a significant reduction in sample unit weight, thereby resulting in a level of compressive strength compatible with a load-bearing wall. The reduction in flexural strength was lower than that in compressive strength. These results shown that the cellular material based on flax particles can be used as suitable insulated load-bearing walls.

This study examines the influence of transportation policies and urbanisation on cycling participation and environmental sustainability in Slovenia. Factor and regression analyses were employed. The yearly data from 2008 to 2021 were isolated. A modest increase in urban cycling frequency was observed, bolstered by investments in environmental protection and safety enhancements; however, additional evidence is needed to confirm the long-term effects (H1). Furthermore, while increased cycling was linked to a reduction in CO2 emissions and improved air quality, the overall environmental benefits were found to be affected by other factors, such as motorisation and public transportation in summer (H2). The study revealed that the introduction of reduced urban speed limits and expanded cycling lanes significantly enhanced cycling safety and desirability, leading to a shift from car usage to bicycles (RQ). These findings indicate that cycling could play a vital role in advancing Slovenia’s sustainable development goals, emphasising the need for continued investments and supportive urbanisation policies.

This study investigates the optimization of aeration rates for the biodrying of market waste using negative-pressure ventilation. Market waste, characterized by a high moisture content (MC) and rapid decomposition, presents challenges in waste management. Over 12 days, three aeration rates (ARs) of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m3/kg/day were examined, and the most effective continuous ventilation configuration was identified in terms of heat generation, moisture reduction, and biodrying efficiency. The results indicate that the most effective AR for heat retention and moisture removal was 0.2 m3/kg/day, achieving a 6.63% MC reduction and a 9.12% low heating value (LHV) increase. Gas analysis showed that, while AR 0.2 supported high microbial activity during the initial 7 days, AR 0.6 sustained higher overall CO2 production due to its greater aeration rate. The findings also suggest that the biodrying of market waste with a high initial MC can achieve significant weight loss and leachate generation when paired with a high aeration rate of 0.6 m3/kg/day, with a 69.8% weight loss and increased waste compaction being recorded. The study suggests that variable ARs can optimize biodrying, making market waste more suitable for conversion to refuse-derived fuel or landfill pre-treatment and improving waste-to-energy processes and sustainability.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic disorder accompanied by ovulatory dysfunction. Insulin resistance (IR) is a key pathogenic mechanism in PCOS, and insulin sensitizers, such as metformin and pioglitazone, can improve PCOS symptoms. Chiglitazar, a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (pan-PPAR) agonist, is also an insulin sensitizer; however, its therapeutic effects have not yet been studied in PCOS. We evaluated the therapeutic effects of chiglitazar in a rat model of PCOS. Sprague–Dawley rats aged 4 weeks were injected subcutaneously with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (6 mg/100 g/day) to establish PCOS, and a control (CON) group was established. The rats were divided into the CON, PCOS model (DHEA), pioglitazone-treated (DHEA + PIO), and chiglitazar-treated (DHEA + CHI) groups. The DHEA + PIO group received pioglitazone (20 mg/kg/day) and the DHEA + CHI group received chiglitazar (20 mg/kg/day), each for 15 days. Body weight, estrous cycle, and glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin resistance test (ITT) results were monitored. Experimental animal energy metabolism systems were utilized to assess metabolic parameters. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to detect changes in serum hormones, including insulin, adiponectin, sex-related hormones, and lipid metabolism indicators. The ovaries were used for molecular biology experiments to detect changes in Akt/phosphorylated Akt and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression by Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Chiglitazar and pioglitazone improved PCOS symptoms. However, chiglitazar demonstrated a more pronounced effect on lipid improvement and weight gain than pioglitazone. In the DHEA + PIO and DHEA + CHI groups, there was notable recovery in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output; substantial improvement in GTT and ITT results; an increase in adiponectin; and a reduction in serum insulin, androgens, luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio. Compared with the DHEA group, the DHEA + CHI group exhibited notable decreases in triglycerides, free fatty acids, and atherosclerosis index, while the DHEA + PIO group demonstrated no changes. Granulosa cells and healthy follicles increased in ovarian sections. Ovarian steroidogenic enzymes also increased in the DHEA + PIO and DHEA + CHI groups compared with the DHEA group. Mechanistically, chiglitazar increased Akt phosphorylation. Chiglitazar significantly improved ovulation in rats with PCOS and may be a potential novel therapeutic strategy for PCOS.

This study investigates the impact of excess air factor (λ) on performance and NOx emissions of a 207-MW boiler furnace, used for steam generation in an industrial water tube boiler installed at Saudi Aramco, at fixed volumetric fuel composition of hydrogen/methane of 10%/90%. The numerical approach employed for this investigation utilized ANSYS-Fluent software. The findings of the study revealed robust correlations between λ, temperature, and NO emissions. An increase in λ led to a decrease in both the average furnace temperature and average NO emissions at the boiler exit. Specifically, increasing the value of λ from 1.05–1.45 consistently reduces the average NO emissions from 1541 ppm to 653 ppm. In other words, a 27% increase in λ resulted in approximately a 55% reduction in NOx emissions. As λ increases, the volumetric absorbed of radiation decreases owing to the reduced concentrations of CO2 and H2O. Notably, the maximum combustion efficiency, reaching 37.88%, is achieved at a λ value of 1.35, corresponding to the lowest average flue gas temperature. The results show that to achieve the best performance with high efficiency and low NO emissions, the boiler needs to be operated at an excess air factor of about 1.35.

As the need for alternative energy sources and reduced emissions grows, proven technologies are often sidelined in favour of emerging solutions that lack the infrastructure for mass adoption. This study explores a transitional approach by modifying existing compression ignition engines to run on a hydrogen/diesel mixture for performance improvement, utilising water injection to mitigate the drawbacks associated with hydrogen combustion. This approach can yield favourable results with current technology. In this modelling study, ten hydrogen energy ratios (0–90%) and nine water injection rates (0–700 mg/cycle) were tested in a turbocharged Cummins ISBe 220 31 six-cylinder diesel engine. An engine experiment was conducted to validate the model. Key performance indicators such as power, mechanical efficiency, thermal efficiency, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were measured. Both water injection and hydrogen injection led to slight improvements in all performance metrics, except BSFC, due to hydrogen’s lower energy density. In terms of emissions, CO and CO2 levels significantly decreased as hydrogen content increased, with reductions of 94% and 96%, respectively, at 90% hydrogen compared to the baseline diesel. Water injection at peak rates further reduced CO emissions by approximately 40%, though it had minimal effect on CO2. As expected, NOx (which is a typical challenge with hydrogen combustion and also with diesel engines in general) increased with hydrogen fuelling, resulting in an approximately 70% increase in total NOx emissions over the range of 0–90% hydrogen energy. Similar increases were observed in NO and NO2, e.g., 90% and 57% increases with 90% hydrogen, respectively. However, water injection reduced NO and NO2 levels by up to 16% and 83%, respectively, resulting in a net decrease in NOX emissions in many combined cases, not only with hydrogen injection but also when compared to baseline diesel.

Abstract. As offshore wind gains momentum within US renewable energy goals, New Jersey’s ambitious targets for offshore wind development represent a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and transition towards cleaner energy sources. This study presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a planned offshore wind farm off of New Jersey’s coast, emphasizing the implications of a domestic supply chain. Key findings show the farm is projected to produce 0.0113 kg CO2 per kWh of electricity generated, reflecting a 98 % decrease in carbon emissions compared to natural gas derived electricity. Further, when compared to carbon emissions of other renewable energy technologies, offshore wind outperforms both solar and onshore wind by 81 % and 48 %, respectively. This finding highlights offshore wind’s role in emissions reduction, as well as the importance of a domestic supply chain to mitigate transportation-related impacts. Additionally, results indicate a need to address the environmental trade-offs of offshore, as steel-intensive materials used in turbines and infrastructure contribute heavily to toxicity-related impacts. This research underscores the potential of offshore wind to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and offers insight into the environmental dynamics of offshore wind energy in the US.

Gravel mulching is a widely employed strategy for water conservation in arid agricultural regions, with potential implications for soil carbon (C) sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. However, soil respiration and CO2-C emissions remain uncertain owing to less consideration of the influence of precipitation patterns and planting age. In this study, we investigated the soil respiration rate (Rsoil) and cumulative CO2-C emission (Ccum), both measured over a period of 72 h, along with soil properties and enzyme activities under different precipitation conditions based on gravel mulching with different planting ages. We analyzed the effects of planting ages on Rsoil and Ccum and revealed the underlying mechanisms driving changes in environmental factors on Rsoil and Ccum. The results demonstrated that the Rsoil reached the maximum value at about 1 h, 0.5 h, and 0.25 h after rewetting in 1, 10, and 20 years of gravel mulching under the condition with 1 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm of precipitation, respectively, whereas the Rsoil exhibited its maximum at about 8 h after soil rewetting under precipitation of 30 mm. The Ccum induced by precipitation pulses tends to decrease with increasing years of gravel mulching. The Ccum was 0.0061 t ha−1 in the 20-year gravel-mulched soil, representing a 53.79% reduction compared to the 1-year gravel-mulched soil. Soil organic matter (SOM), planting ages, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were the primary factors influencing the Rsoil and Ccum in 0–20 cm, while SOM, planting ages, and soil porosity (AirP) were the key factors affecting the Rsoil and Ccum in 20–40 cm. The Rsoil and Ccum in the 0–20 cm soil were regulated by soil enzyme activities, while those of 20–40 cm soil were controlled by soil properties. This indicates that the decrease in Rsoil and Ccum is caused by soil degradation, characterized by a decrease in SOM and ALP. This study offers a novel insight into the long-term environmental impact of gravel mulching measures in arid areas, which is helpful in providing a theoretical basis for dryland agricultural management. It is imperative to consider the duration of gravel mulching when predicting the potential for C sequestration in arid agricultural areas.

Environmental taxation has emerged as a promising policy tool to combat the pressing challenge of carbon emissions and address the adverse impacts of climate change. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of environmental taxation in the G20 nations, a diverse group of major economies that collectively contribute to a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this research is to assess the role of environmental taxation in influencing carbon emission levels across G20 countries. To achieve this, review of the literature on environmental taxation, and carbon emission reduction strategies in each G20 nation was conducted. Additionally, data from international databases, governmental reports, and academic studies were analysed and Johansen co-integration test was applied to test the hypothesis. It was found that environment taxation is important variable to manage CO2 emissions and to focus on sustainable growth of the nations. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance the effectiveness of environmental taxation measures in their respective countries. By identifying successful policy approaches and lessons learned from G20 nations, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how environmental taxation can play a pivotal role in addressing carbon emissions and advancing global efforts to combat climate change.

Catalytic activity, mechanisms, and active sites were determined for methane steam reforming (MSR) over gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) supported iridium (0.1 wt%) prepared by impregnation of GDC with iridium acetylacetonate. Isothermal steady-state rate measurements followed by micro-gas chromatography analysis were performed at 660 and 760 °C over Ir/GDC samples pretreated in N2 or H2 at 900 °C. Transient responses to CH4 or H2O step changes in isothermal conditions were carried out at 750 °C over Ir/GDC pretreated in He or H2 using online quadrupole mass spectrometry. In the proposed mechanism, Ir/GDC proceeds through a dual-type active site associating, as follows: (i) Ir metallic particles surface as active sites for the cracking of CH4 into reactive C species, and (ii) reducible (Ce4+) sites at GDC surface responsible for a redox mechanism involving Ce4+/Ce3+ sites, being reduced by reaction with reactive C into CO (or CO2) depending on the oxidation state of GDC and re-oxidized by H2O. Full reduction of reducible oxygen species is possible with CH4 after He treatment, whereas only 80% is reached in CH4 after H2 treatment.

Every year, 10.8 to 19.1 billion tonnes of CO2 are emitted through food exports, which accounts for roughly 21% - 37% of the world’s global total emissions. In the urge to expand businesses and ensure availability of all crops throughout the year, the quality of air is being compromised. The demand for crops rises in tandem with population growth and improvements in human well-being. In addition, most of these exported crops lose their nutritional value due to the unhealthy exposure of preservatives and other farming chemicals. There are multiple factors involved in crop production: land, labour, transportation, storage etc. Aeroponics is a relatively new farming system that eradicates numerous problems by using less land and water and requiring minimal labour and nutrients. The aim of this project is to convert the aeroponic farming unit into a 100% carbon-neutral, self-reliant unit called Aerogarden by integrating modern technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI). Every household having an Aerogarden unit can access fresh organic vegetables and microgreens that actually retain their nutritional value. By achieving this goal, non-agricultural nations' dependence on food imports will lessen, which will ultimately result in a reduction in the sector's carbon footprint. By giving people a way to directly support the international movement, the project also aims to support the UN's initiative to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Pyrolysis is an effective method of turning complex materials, like waste, into valuable commodities. This process stands out because it can be easily adjusted to change different parameters and improve the quality of the final products. Biomass, abundant in carbonaceous constituents, emerges as a primary candidate for pyrolysis, presenting the opportunity to generate a diverse array of carbon-based products with broad applicability and desirability, including activated carbon (AC), magnetic activated carbon (MAC), graphene, and carbon nanotubes (CNT). The study explores various methodologies of biomass pyrolysis, highlighting the factors that influence product characteristics and examining the potential applications of pyrolysis-derived products. These processes demonstrate the capability of pyrolysis technology to convert biomass into valuable carbon-based materials, which are highly sought after in applications ranging from environmental remediation and other relevant applications. AC and MAC can be synthesized from biomass through pyrolysis. At the same time, graphene and CNT can be derived from the hydrocarbon fraction of pyrolyzed biomass or through in situ exfoliation and oxidation-reduction reactions of graphite. A comprehensive examination of these facets establishes a framework for grasping the potential of pyrolysis in biomass conversion and the possibilities for commercializing the end-products. The global warming potential of graphene production is higher compared to other materials (reaching 106 kg CO2/kg), making it the most expensive material (US$ 857/cm2). The predicted global market size for the commercial viability of AC, graphene, and CNT has a steady incline, indicating a robust rising trend in demand. This increasing demand makes the production of these materials attractive and significant economically.

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is the latest industry development, attempting to build smart systems by combining physical objects with digital innovations. The main idea behind the chapter's attempt is to empirically assess the link between I4.0 and sustainability performance, particularly in the context of green supply chain (GSC) and social responsibility (SR). In industry, data-driven investigation is required to show how I4.0 and sustainability performance are related. Thus, this chapter attempts to close this research gap by empirically assessing the link between the two paradigms. I4.0 technologies can reduce energy and resource consumption, which leads to a reduction in waste or CO2 emissions across production and supply chain processes. Smart plants support worker health and safety by enhancing working conditions, which results in higher worker satisfaction and ambition. A coordinated and proactive procedure among supply chain (SC) managers is essential to curb the environment and SCs. Supplier-customer environmental cooperation (SCEC) may be understood as the collaborative efforts made among partners to enhance understanding and support toward improving environmental performance through greener products and innovations. The idea of SR is that organizations should behave in a manner that enhances their surroundings and society as a whole. Companies with more SR always ask suppliers to be more socially responsible just for the sake of implementing SR throughout the SC management and focusing on the welfare of society, their efficiency in all aspects, and the performance of their suppliers who take part in their activities. Overall, this chapter aims to demonstrate how GSC, I4.0, and SR are interconnected and can be leveraged to enhance sustainability performance.

Electrolyte alkaline cations can significantly modulate the reaction selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R), enhancing the yield of the valuable multicarbon (C2+) chemical feedstocks. However, the mechanism underlying this cation effect on the C–C coupling remains unclear. Herein, by performing constant-potential AIMD simulations, we studied the dynamic behavior of interfacial K+ ions over Cu surfaces during C–C coupling and the origin of the cation effect. We showed that the specific adsorption of K+ readily occurs at the surface sites adjacent to the *CO intermediates on the Cu surfaces. Furthermore, this specific adsorption of K+ during *CO–*CO coupling is more important than quasi-specific adsorption for enhancing coupling kinetics, reducing the coupling barriers by approximately 0.20 eV. Electronic structure analysis revealed that charge redistribution occurs between the specifically adsorbed K+, *CO, and Cu sites, and this can account for the reduced barriers. In addition, we identified excellent *CO–*CO coupling selectivity on Cu(100) with K+ ions. Experimental results show that suppressing surface K+-specific adsorption using the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) significantly decreases the Faradaic efficiency for C2 products from 41.1% to 4.3%, consistent with our computational findings. This study provides crucial insights for improving the selectivity toward C2+ products by rationally tuning interfacial cation adsorption during eCO2R. Specifically, C–C coupling can be enhanced by promoting K+-specific adsorption, for example, by confining K+ within a coated layer or using pulsed negative potentials.

Abstract Background Telemedicine is increasingly common in gastroenterology and may represent an opportunity for improving sustainability in medical care. The purpose of this study was to determine the carbon emissions related to travel for in-person gastroenterology clinic appointments. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis evaluating carbon emissions associated with travel to gastroenterology appointments over a 2-week period. We determined the average number of appointments per day and used patient’s postal codes to estimate travel distances. We estimated carbon emissions based on these travel distances and completed sensitivity analyses to model methods for emissions reductions. Results We assessed 975 clinic appointments, of which 71 were excluded (eg, insufficient data, non-physician appointments), leaving 904 included appointments of which 75% were follow-up (678) and the remainder were new consultations (226). Sixteen different gastroenterologists had an average of 22.7 patients per clinic. The mean return distance travelled per appointment was 57.3 km which translates to 14.9 kg CO2 per patient visit. An average day at our clinic was equal to burning 146.6 L of gasoline or the annual carbon capture of 15.5 trees. By changing follow-up appointments or those with a travel distance over 100 km to telehealth, emissions were reduced by 77%. Conclusions We demonstrate that a relatively modest change in the number of in-person visits can save thousands of litres of gasoline emissions annually from each practicing clinician. While we cannot avoid emissions related to travel for procedure-based appointments, the use of telemedicine is one potential strategy to reduce healthcare-related emissions.

Currently, there is a massive use of electric vehicles in the world. This is due to the ever-increasing importance and severity of the environmental safety issue. Now, there is no more convenient, affordable, popular and at the same time less harmful alternative to road transport. The annual global emissions are more than 25 million tons of pollutants of various origins, which are extremely dangerous for nature in general. On average, they increase by 3% every year. The transport sector accounts for 23% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Electric vehicles can contribute enormously to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In 2025, sales of electric vehicles are expected to increase to 100 000 units. By 2030, the number of electric vehicles will reach 1.5 million units. However, widespread adoption of electric vehicles will cause an increase in electricity consumption. In addition, an appropriate charging infrastructure is required to power electric vehicles. It is worth noting that the market for electric vehicles and charging stations is developing dynamically with an annual growth rate up to 80%. The main barriers to the development of electric vehicles in Russia are their high cost and underdeveloped network of charging stations. The relevance of the problem is confirmed by an order signed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in March 2022 to allocate about 1.37 billion rubles for the creation of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in Russia. As for incentives, there are many of them. This is the need to solve the environmental problem in large cities, achieve the goal of reducing CO2 emissions and pursue industrial policy, including the policy of innovative development of the country. Another way of increasing the payback of charging stations is the employment of smart services, which can reduce the cost of technological connection through dynamic power distribution between the main facility and the charging station. There are other, more advanced solutions, which are currently being piloted, such as optimization of investment in network infrastructure, including an operator of a regional public charging infrastructure. This study focuses on the development of a power supply system to connect an electric vehicle charging station to a substation in Novosibirsk. The connected electric vehicle charger, being a non-linear load, can not only increase the load on the power grid infrastructure, but also cause a deterioration in the power quality due to the generation of harmonic distortions. Therefore, special attention is paid to the analysis of the power supply quality during the operation of the charging station by using the model developed in the MATLAB Simulink software for the analysis of harmonics.    

    

## The public's pragmatic attitude to transport and what it means for achieving net zero

Engaging the public in the shift to sustainable travel behaviours The new Labour government wishes to be seen as a global climate leader and has prioritised delivering greener transport. Among its commitments are measures to improve public transport and make streets more attractive for those walking, wheeling and cycling. These transport policies are welcomed by many, but have also attracted opposition from some politicians and media outlets, and been the focus of intense pushback in several communities. How can the government achieve net zero transport in a way that is publicly acceptable? The UK has made limited progress in reducing emissions from transport over the past three decades and transport is now the country's largest emitting sector. In standard emissions calculations, surface transport currently accounts for more carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than aviation, with car use responsible for 52 per cent of domestic transport emissions.1 While these accounts do not adjust for non-CO2 impacts of aviation nor emissions from return flights, therefore underplaying aviation's role, reducing surface transport emissions must be central to the UK's climate commitments. Indeed, avoiding driving is frequently cited as the single most effective action that individuals can take to cut their carbon footprint, followed by switching from a petrol/diesel car to an electric vehicle (EV).2 "The transport sector is … inequitable, unhealthy and inefficient" The transport sector is also unsustainable in other ways, besides being a major greenhouse gas contributor. It is inequitable, unhealthy and inefficient. People with an annual income of more than £100,000 travel almost three times further than those with an income under £10,000;3 meanwhile 28 per cent of the poorest fifth of households do not have a car, compared with just 6 per cent of the wealthiest fifth.4 Dominance of car use has also contributed to rising obesity, accidents and air pollution. And road traffic is estimated to place costs equivalent to £31.9 billion a year on communities in Britain, equivalent to 1.6 per cent of GDP.5 Shifting to a more sustainable transport system would therefore bring environmental, health, social and economic benefits. Technology alone cannot deliver this. Reducing emissions from transport requires profound behaviour change too. Indeed, behaviour change is needed for all levels of the 'avoid, shift, improve' sustainable travel hierarchy. Avoiding the need to travel by using digital alternatives is essential to decarbonise transport, and requires radically different ways of interacting and working. Shifting to more sustainable – public, shared and active – modes of travel means breaking car-use habits and reconfiguring travel choices. Even switching from petrol/diesel to EV requires consumers to choose greener cars, and to adapt vehicle-refuelling habits to engage with the growing EV charging infrastructure. In fact, behaviour change is fundamental to achieving net zero in all sectors. According to the Climate Change Committee, more than 60 per cent of the measures needed to reach net zero will require behaviour change by consumers, and the remainder will involve behaviour change by businesses.6 However, in 2022, a House of Lords inquiry found that the UK government's approach to achieving sustainable behaviour change was 'seriously inadequate'.7 There has been a preference for information provision to inform consumer decision-making (so-called 'downstream' measures), over incentives, regulations or infrastructure provision ('upstream' measures) that alter the attractiveness or availability of options for consumers. Yet, extensive evidence shows that information provision alone is ineffective in changing behaviour. One meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials testing behavioural interventions to promote household action on climate change found that information provision was 2 to 3 per cent effective, compared with interventions that alter choices (nudges), which are on average 25 per cent effective, and can reach 90 per cent effective. Moreover, informational approaches tend to exacerbate inequality, as they do not remove structural barriers (for example, cost or inconvenience) to behaviour change.8 "the UK government's approach to achieving sustainable behaviour change was 'seriously inadequate'" Transport behaviours are particularly driven by physical and geographical factors, such as the availability of parking or public transport routes, and by economic factors (for example, income); whereas psychological factors (such as knowledge and values) tend to be less important.9 As alluded to above, information provision is likely to be particularly ineffective to change behaviours. Moreover, travel behaviours are highly habitual – regular trips, such as commutes, become automatic and routine, and less amenable to change through information.10 Changing car-use habits requires disrupting old routines as well as creating new ones; in this sense, 'pull' measures, like creating cycle lanes or increasing bus frequency, will not suffice; 'push' measures like congestion charges or road reallocation will also be required.11 Push and pull together are needed. Cities across Europe have demonstrated how crucial push measures can be as part of an integrated plan to improve public transport infrastructure. London's congestion charge is credited with stopping three million additional journeys by car in 2019 and boosted bus travel by a third (33 per cent) on implementation.12 In Stockholm, congestion pricing achieved a 22 per cent reduction in the 10 years from its implementation in 2006, despite a growing population.13 Such initiatives defy the long-held maxim in transport policymaking that increasing numbers of people and a growing economy necessarily lead to more car use. Urban leaders who recognise the harms caused by traffic to their local economy, environment and communities have shown that an alternative path is possible. "Changing car-use habits requires disrupting old routines as well as creating new ones" Rural communities in the UK face different barriers in making changes to how they travel to their urban counterparts. Many feel that EVs, public transport and active travel are all currently out of their reach due to a lack of charging infrastructure, unsafe routes or inadequate bus and train services. In these areas, the focus must be on addressing the barriers to behaviour change, including working with rural authorities to revive the fortunes of towns that can act as anchors for local services and amenities and provide multi-modal transport hubs.14 In Cornwall, for example, car dependency is higher than in more urban regions, so the council there has been trialling shared mobility solutions, including providing credits and marketing for shared e-bikes.15 The Welsh government has also been trialling rural sustainable mobility solutions, including local working hubs and loans for e-bikes and e-cargo bikes.16 However, some policies, while highly effective in changing behaviour, can be controversial. Public backlash in response to Ultra Low Emission Zones and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods exemplifies how a vocal minority can politicise transport policy and challenge local authority efforts to promote alternatives to fossil-fuelled cars. This opposition is in part fed by the 'democratic chasm' that has opened up between communities and authorities,17 as local news services have closed and disinformation is spread online. Right-leaning media and politicians have gone as far as to call these (proposed) policies a 'war on motorists', implying that motorists constitute a definable demographic or identity group. But to what extent does this assumption reflect public views and behaviours? "Right-leaning media and politicians have gone as far as to call these (proposed) policies a 'war on motorists'" Recent research commissioned by IPPR suggests that, for the vast majority of the UK public, transport is pragmatic, not ideological.18 Owning a car is not a marker of identity in any meaningful way and people are not especially attached to their cars. In fact, people want transport systems to change and public transport is actually valued more highly than cars. Across different social groups, and regardless of whether someone is a car owner or not, there is strong support for a wide range of policies that would support achieving net zero, reducing transport costs and delivering healthier, safer streets. Notably, schemes such as school streets (which see road space opened up to children travelling actively to school) are supported by all voter segments used in this analysis. Change is hard and can be disruptive to people's daily routines, but there is a clear consensus that transport at the moment isn't working, and there is an appetite for a new approach − as long as it takes the cost-of-living crisis into account. "there is a clear consensus that transport at the moment isn't working, and there is an appetite for a new approach" The research also found that there is a lack of trust in decision-makers in relation to transport, although there is more trust in local leaders, including local authorities and mayors. It is clear that 'fairness' is a critical condition for the acceptance of transport policies – this includes distributional and procedural fairness (providing a voice for the public in decision-making). To win support for social change, authorities must listen to diverse perspectives, co-design policies that address people's concerns, and understand which narratives and language work best within their communities. Taken together with wider evidence on behaviour change and public engagement, the research report concludes that a transition to a sustainable transport system requires upstream public engagement – early and substantive involvement of citizens and communities in transport policymaking. This engagement can not only help avoid backlash but also improve the quality and effectiveness of decision-making.19 This engagement should happen at two levels: strategic involvement in national net zero policy and in developing general principles for sustainable transport policies (for example, Climate Assembly UK and Welsh Government Net Zero 2035); and the co-development of local transport schemes through place-based engagement and community relationship building. The Republic of Ireland provides a practical case study of how the UK government may approach strategic engagement of the public in the shift to sustainable mobility. The Irish government's department for transport has published its principles and practical actions to foster 'public engagement on climate action and sustainable mobility'.20 This combines an awareness of the need for supportive mainstream media messages on sustainable travel alongside fostering a shift in how the state works – recognising that engagement is a two-way process, in which government must listen and learn. The UK is long overdue a public engagement strategy for net zero,21 and should urgently adopt the best practice being set by its nearest European neighbour. "The UK is long overdue a public engagement strategy for net zero" Importantly, public engagement is not a replacement for political will and leadership. Major changes in transport norms and the redesign of public spaces have only been achieved through the willingness of leaders to engage with the evidence of what is and isn't working and make the case for trying something new. In Janette Sadik-Khan's Streetfight she details the approach taken during her time as New York's commissioner of transportation under Mayor Bloomberg. During this period, road space in the city was reallocated to social, commercial and public or active transport at a rapid pace, often using temporary materials, such as planters, with the ability to make adaptations quickly if things didn't go to plan. A clear vision, backed up by a politician willing to spend political capital, drove a culture change in what was seen as within the remit of a transport department and what was considered possible in reshaping city streets. The engagement of communities in this process, and active sharing of data on the impact of trials, helped smooth the notorious 'Goodwin curve' of public opinion – where public support drops prior to implementation but rises when benefits are realised.22 Unfortunately for New Yorkers, they are still waiting to see this approach applied to congestion charging.23 "The climate crisis requires us to change, at an unprecedented pace, how we travel The climate crisis requires us to change, at an unprecedented pace, how we travel. This does not mean changes should be rushed. The British public are pragmatists and their views on transport are shaped by what they see and experience as they go about their lives. Winning the case for change means making greener transport choices possible for more people and urgently addressing the stresses caused by many people's attempts to engage with public transport. Action must be practical, fair and rooted in empathetic engagement of the public. Delivering on the government's goals requires a new relationship between communities and transport decision-makers, and a willingness to 'move fast, and fix things' – together.

Urachal remnant (UR) is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from the obliteration failure of a fibrous tube which connects the umbilicus to the bladder dome during embryological development. Laparoscopic resection has been used for symptomatic UR in recent years, and simultaneous umbilical resection has been reported to prevent the recurrence of umbilical infection.1 Empirically, the CO2 insufflation pressure decreases during umbilical resection, which sometimes makes it difficult to achieve a safe surgical field. The AirSeal™ Intelligent Flow System (SurgiQuest, Milford, USA; ConMed Japan, Tokyo) is an insufflator designed to maintain pneumoperitoneum pressure with continuous smoke evacuation and CO2 recirculation during surgery.2 Several advantages were reported in urologic surgeries, such as shown in Table S1.2 In this report, we evaluated a modified method of laparoscopic surgery for UR, using a 5-mm port connected to AirSeal. A 26-year-old man was diagnosed with UR at a nearby hospital using magnetic resonance imaging due to repeated umbilical infections. The patient visited our hospital for UR surgery, and laparoscopic umbilical resection was performed. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position, and a Foley catheter was inserted. The transperitoneal approach was employed, and the first 12-mm port was inserted using Hasson's open technique on the right border of the rectus abdominis at the level of the umbilicus. Pneumoperitoneum was achieved by CO2 insufflation to a pressure of 10 mmHg, and a 10-mm flexible laparoscope was placed using this port. Next, a 5- and 12-mm working ports were placed under the direct vision; the 12-mm port was located 7 cm caudal, 5 mm lateral to the first port, and the 5-mm port was located 7 cm cranial, 5 mm lateral to the first port, respectively, and AirSeal was connected to the 5-mm port (Figure 1). Between the bilateral umbilical ducts, LigaSure™ MaryLand (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was used to dissect the UR from the posterior layer of the rectus abdominis sheath. UR was dissected in the caudal direction, clipped, and cut just above the bladder dome using a Hem-o-lok (Teleflex, Wayne, USA) (Figure 1b). UR was then dissected in the cranial direction to the rectus abdominis sheath just below the umbilicus, and the resection range of the umbilical skin was determined using a cathelin needle. The cathelin needle was inserted from outside the body along the skin incision line, and the resection range was decided by confirming the needle in intra-peritoneum vision (Figure 1c). The UR and attached umbilical skin were excised using an appropriate resection line (Figure 1d). After urachal excision, Endo Close™ (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was used to secure the closure of the urachal defect. Under intraperitoneal observation of the urachal cavity, an Endo Close needle with a 70-cm absorbable suture was inserted from outside the body, and the rectus abdominis fascia, muscle, and peritoneum were punctured. The suture was then left in the body, the EndoClose needle was inserted again from the opposite side of the urachal cavity, and the suture was captured. The suture was pulled to the skin level and ligated (Figure 1e). This process was repeated to bridge the defects. The insufflation pressure and surgical field were maintained during the procedure, despite the umbilical cavity. Finally, umbilicoplasty was performed with the assistance of a plastic surgeon. Intra- or retro-peritoneal approach, single-site and robot assisted surgery have recently been employed for laparoscopic UR surgery.3-6 The peritoneal approach provides a large enough cavity for laparoscopic working; however, it has a risk of intestine injury and retro-peritoneal approach often does not have enough cavity to set the ports.6 Moreover, single-site or robotic surgery is devoid of umbilical resection.4, 5 Due to the maintenance of insufflation pressure, our modification achieves a large operation field throughout the procedure, which might result in the reduction of risk of not only intestine injury but also abdominal incisional hernia, a known complication of umbilical resection.7 It is sure, that a muscle hook might achieve a similar view by lifting abdominal wall, and a proficient operator might perform the same operation without AirSeal system. However, one of the maximum advantages of AirSeal system is considered to make a safe view and procedure, not depending on the operator's experience. Furthermore, in our active umbilical infection case, this method was useful given the larger umbilical cavity. Despite the diameter being over 5 cm of urachal defect, the surgical field was maintained due to AirSeal (Figure 1f), suggesting that the modification could be effective regardless of the urachal defect size. Our study, for the first time, evaluated the impact of AirSeal on laparoscopic surgery for UR and it can potentially overcome problems associated with other methods.

The plastics industry is in constant evolution looking to improve the properties of new materials and performance in different applications. Currently, the environmental impact associated with the use of plastics is one of the main concerns for the society. It was reflected in regulations at European level such as SUP Directive, Green Deal or studies such as Patents for tomorrow's plastics by European Patent Office on the trends reflected in research on alternative materials to conventional plastic. In order to transfer these new and more sustainable alternatives to an industrial and realistic environment, first applied research has to be carried out on both the development and processes of the materials to optimize their performance. In this thesis study, applied research was carried out using ultrasound technology on different nanocomposites and their transformation processes. Advances in the application of ultrasound for different transformation processes have been studied previously to ensure the approach of the practical study. This study focuses on the application of ultrasound in the process of obtaining new formulations by compounding extrusion and in injection molding, specifically in microinjection. The application of nanotechnology in the development of new materials will allow an improvement in performance and will open a range of new possibilities and applications. To explore the potential of ultrasonic molding (USM) technology, a preliminary process stability study was performed with polypropylene. The evaluation was carried out from a mechanical point of view, in which it was shown that, with an optimization of the process parameters and a correct design approach of the components with the nodal point allow a stability close to production was allowed. To deepen into the potential of USM technology in synergy with new nanocomposite formulations, a comparative study with the conventional microinjection process was performed. Two different nanocomposites based on a biopolymer matrix of poly 3-hydroxybutyrate with Cloisite 20 (organic modification), and with Cloisite 116 (unmodified) were studied. This research reveals that the USM technology, is stable obtaining micro-pieces, maintaining the chemical structure of the initial biocomposite without degrading and homogeneously achieving an exfoliation of both nanoclays. Conventional microinjection did show slight changes in the level of degradation and chemical structure, highlighting that it was not possible to micro-mold samples of the material with the unmodified nanoclay. The stabilization of the compounding extrusion assisted by an ultrasound system has been studied, with a design of a single component that allows the new approach to work in continuous condition and on pre-industrial equipment. Due to the success of the new component, it was possible to carry out the study of new formulations of polypropylene loaded with two different nanoclays (Cloisite 20 and Garamite 1958) and glass bubbles. The new nanocomposites reached the mechanical properties of a conventional material used for door panels in the automotive sector, but with a reduced density. The aim was to demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the weight of plastic components used in the automotive industry and reduce CO2 emissions for a standard vehicle. The research carried out in this thesis work has opened a new field of application to nanocomposites for weight reduction with improved mechanical properties when high level of dispersion is reached. In addition, the potential of USM technology for micro-molding applications has been demonstrated, showing high stability without material degradation during the process, and good dispersion of nano-reinforcements. El sector del plástico está en continuo cambio en busca de mejorar sus propiedades y rendimiento en diferentes aplicaciones. Actualmente. el impacto ambiental asociado al uso de los plásticos es una de las principales preocupaciones en el ámbito social. Se puede ver reflejado en regulaciones a nivel europeo como SUP Directive. Green Deal o estudios como el que efectúa la Oficina de Patentes Europeas Patents for tomorrow's plastics sobre las tendencias que reflejan las investigaciones en materiales alternativos al plástico convencional. Para poder llevar a un ambiente industrial y realista estas nuevas alternativas más sostenibles. primero se ha de llevar a cabo una investigación aplicada tanto del desarrollo de los materiales como de los procesos que pueden optimizar su rendimiento. En este estudio de tesis se lleva a cabo una investigación aplicada sobre diferentes nanocompuestos y sus procesos de transformación que pueden ser mejorados con la tecnología de ultrasonidos. Se ha estudiado los avances en la aplicación de ultrasonidos para diferentes procesos de transformación con el objetivo de enfocar correctamente el estudio práctico. Este estudio centra la aplicación de los ultrasonidos en el proceso de obtención de nuevas formulaciones por extrusión compounding y en el moldeo por inyección, concretamente en microinyeccion. La aplicación de nanotecnología en el desarrollo de nuevos materiales permitirá una mejora del rendimiento y abrirá un abanico de nuevas posibilidades y aplicaciones. Para explorar el potencial de la tecnología de microinyección por ultrasonidos (USM}, se realizó un estudio preliminar de estabilidad del proceso con un polipropileno. La evaluación fue llevada a cabo desde un punto de vista mecánico, en el que se demostró que con una optimización de los parámetros de proceso y un enfoque de diseño correcto de los componentes que hacen intervenir el punto nodal, se puede alcanzar un nivel de estabilidad cercano a producción. Para profundizar en el potencial de la tecnología USM en sinergia con nuevas formulaciones de nanocompuestos, se realizó un estudio comparativo con el proceso de microinyección convencional. Dos nanocompuestos basados en una matriz del biopolímero poli 3-hidroxibutirato con Cloisite 20 (modificación orgánica). Y con Cloisite 116 (sin modificar) fueron estudiados. Este estudio revela que la tecnología USM además de ser estable en la obtención de micropiezas, mantiene la estructura química del biocompuesto inicial sin llegar a degradación y alcanzando homogéneamente la exfoliación de ambas nanoarcillas. La microinyección convencional si mostro ligeros cambios a nivel de degradación y estructura química, destacando que no fue posible micromoldear muestras del material con la nanoarcilla sin modificar. La estabilización del proceso de extrusión compounding asistida por ultrasonidos ha sido estudiado, diseñando un componente único que permite al sistema de ultrasonidos trabajar en régimen continuo en equipos preindustriales. Gracias al éxito del nuevo componente, se ha podido llevar a cabo el estudio de nuevas formulaciones de polipropileno argado con dos nanoarcillas diferentes (Cloisite 20 y Garamite 1958) y esferas huecas. Los nuevos nanocompuestos alcanzaron las propiedades mecánicas de un material empleado para paneles de puerta en el sector automoción, pero con una densidad reducida. El objetivo fue demostrar que se puede reducir el peso de los componentes plásticos empleados en automoción y reducir las emisiones de CO2 para un vehículo estándar. La investigación llevada a cabo en este trabajo de tesis ha permitido abrir un nuevo campo de aplicación a los nanocompuestos para reducción de densidad con buenas propiedades mecánicas cuando la dispersión es alta. Además, se ha demostrado el potencial de la tecnología USM para aplicaciones de micromoldeo, mostrando alta estabilidad sin degradación del material durante el proceso, y buena dispersión de los nano-refuerzos.

Η αύξηση του ανθρώπινου πληθυσμού οδηγεί σε αυξημένη ζήτηση ζωικών προϊόντων, γεγονός που πιέζει τα συστήματα ζωικής παραγωγής να εξελιχθούν τόσο σε αποτελεσματικότητα όσο και σε παραγωγή. Τα κτηνοτροφικά κτίρια (συστήματα εντατικής κτηνοτροφίας) διαδραματίζουν σημαντικό ρόλο στην κάλυψη αυτής της ζήτησης, καθώς επιτρέπουν στα ζώα να παραμένουν σε ελεγχόμενο περιβάλλον για καλύτερη ανάπτυξη και παραγωγή. Ωστόσο, οι συμβατικές κτηνοτροφικές πρακτικές έχουν συνδεθεί με περιβαλλοντικά ζητήματα σχετικά με τις εκπομπές αερίων του θερμοκηπίου, την υπερκατανάλωση ενέργειας, τις προκλήσεις διαχείρισης αποβλήτων και την έλλειψη ελέγχου του μικροκλίματος. Ως εκ τούτου, οι βιώσιμες κτηνοτροφικές πρακτικές έχουν μεγάλη σημασία στις μέρες μας. Ο περιβαλλοντικός αντίκτυπος των κτηνοτροφικών πρακτικών θα πρέπει να μειωθεί με την εισαγωγή καινοτόμων συστημάτων κάλυψης-εξοικονόμησης ενέργειας, που συμβάλλουν στη μείωση των εκπομπών αερίων του θερμοκηπίου. Από την άλλη πλευρά, οι καινοτόμες κτηνοτροφικές πρακτικές συνεπάγονται την ενσωμάτωση ανανεώσιμων πηγών ενέργειας, τη βελτιωμένη διαχείριση αποβλήτων και τα συστήματα εξοικονόμησης ενέργειας, ενώ παράλληλα ενισχύουν την ευημερία και την απόδοση των ζώων βελτιώνοντας τις συνθήκες μικροκλίματος στο εσωτερικό των κτηνοτροφικών εγκαταστάσεων. Τα συστήματα περιβαλλοντικού ελέγχου μπορούν να διατηρήσουν την κατάλληλη ποιότητα του αέρα, τη θερμοκρασία και τα επίπεδα σχετικής υγρασίας, ενώ ο συνδυασμός τους με συστήματα αξιοποίησης ανανεώσιμων πηγών ενέργειας μπορεί να ευθυγραμμίσει την κτηνοτροφική παραγωγή με τους κλιματικούς στόχους και να ελαχιστοποιήσει τις περιβαλλοντικές επιπτώσεις του τομέα. Η προσαρμογή τέτοιων πρακτικών μπορεί δυνητικά να ανταποκριθεί στις αυξανόμενες απαιτήσεις χωρίς να διακυβεύεται η βιωσιμότητα ή η υγεία και η απόδοση των ζώων, ενώ συμβάλλει στην «πράσινη» και ενεργειακά αποδοτική κτηνοτροφία. Η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή επικεντρώνεται στην ανάπτυξη ενός καινοτόμου συστήματος για τη βελτίωση της ενεργειακής απόδοσης των κτιρίων κτηνοτροφίας, την ενίσχυση της ευζωίας των ζώων μέσω της ρύθμισης των συνθηκών μικροκλίματος, την επίτευξη περιβαλλοντικής βιωσιμότητας μέσω της μείωσης των εκπομπών αερίων του θερμοκηπίου και την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών αναγκών των κτηνοτροφικών κτιρίων. Η ολοκληρωμένη προσέγγιση που ακολουθείται στην παρούσα διατριβή περιλαμβάνει ένα αυτοματοποιημένο σύστημα ρύθμισης του μικροκλίματος και την αξιοποίηση μιας ανανεώσιμης πηγής ενέργειας, συγκεκριμένα του βιοαερίου που παράγεται από τα ζωικά απόβλητα του ιδίου κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου μέσω της διαδικασίας της αναερόβιας χώνευσης, για την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών αναγκών του κτιρίου. Το πειραματικό κτηνοτροφικό κτίριο στέγαζε πρόβατα και βρισκόταν στη Γαλάτιστα στην περιοχή της Χαλκιδικής. Πραγματοποιήθηκαν οι κατάλληλες εγκαταστάσεις εξοπλισμού για την ενσωμάτωση του προτεινόμενου συστήματος. Το αυτοματοποιημένο σύστημα παρακολουθούσε συνεχώς τις εσωτερικές περιβαλλοντικές παραμέτρους, όπως η θερμοκρασία, η υγρασία και οι εκπομπές όπως CH4, CO2, NH3, και εκτελούσε έλεγχο του μικροκλίματος προκειμένου να επιτευχθούν οι βέλτιστες συνθήκες ανοίγοντας και κλείνοντας τα παράθυρα όταν χρειαζόταν, με βάση τις καταγεγραμμένες περιβαλλοντικές παραμέτρους από τους εγκατεστημένους αισθητήρες. Επιπλέον, διερευνήθηκε η δυνατότητα χρήσης του βιοαερίου που παράγεται μέσω αναερόβιας χώνευσης από τα κτηνοτροφικά απόβλητα του κτιρίου για θερμική ενέργεια, ώστε να μειωθεί η εξάρτηση από συμβατικές πηγές ενέργειας και, ως εκ τούτου, να μειωθεί το αποτύπωμα άνθρακα του κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου. Αυτό επιτυγχάνεται με τον προσδιορισμό του δυναμικού βιοαερίου από τα απόβλητα του κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου σε διαφορετικά σενάρια μέσω της διαδικασίας αναερόβιας χώνευσης, και τέλος, με τη διενέργεια εκτεταμένης ενεργειακής ανάλυσης για να αξιολογηθεί κατά πόσον οι ενεργειακές ανάγκες του κτιρίου μπορούν να καλυφθούν, ώστε να επιτευχθούν βέλτιστες συνθήκες μικροκλίματος για τα φιλοξενούμενα ζώα και να μειωθούν οι εκπομπές αερίων του θερμοκηπίου. Αξιολογήθηκαν απόβλητα από διαφορετικά είδη ζώων, πρόβατα (υφιστάμενο κτηνοτροφικό κτίριο) και κατσίκια (άλλο κτηνοτροφικό κτίριο). Αυτή η ολιστική προσέγγιση βελτιώνει την εξοικονόμηση ενέργειας και μειώνει τις περιβαλλοντικές επιπτώσεις των κτηνοτροφικών πρακτικών, ενώ παράλληλα παρέχει βελτιωμένη ευζωία των ζώων μέσω του κατάλληλου ελέγχου του μικροκλίματος. Η παρούσα εργασία περιγράφει μια νέα ολοκληρωμένη προσέγγιση με ένα αυτοματοποιημένο σύστημα και ένα θεωρητικό σύστημα αξιοποίησης του βιοαερίου για την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών αναγκών των κτηνοτροφικών κτιρίων προς την κατεύθυνση πράσινων κτηνοτροφικών πρακτικών για βιώσιμες και ενεργειακά ανεξάρτητες από το δίκτυο εφαρμογές. Τα αποτελέσματα έδειξαν ότι το προτεινόμενο αυτοματοποιημένο σύστημα σε συνδυασμό με την ενέργεια που παράγεται από βιοαέριο από τα εκκρινόμενα απόβλητα μπορεί να επηρεάσει σημαντικά το μικροκλίμα του υπό μελέτη κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου και να καλύψει τις ενεργειακές του ανάγκες θέρμανσης στις περισσότερες από τις εξεταζόμενες περιπτώσεις. Το σύστημα ρύθμισε με επιτυχία τη θερμοκρασία, τη σχετική υγρασία και τα επίπεδα αερίων ελέγχοντας τις λειτουργίες των παραθύρων, οδηγώντας σε ένα βελτιωμένο περιβάλλον για την καλή διαβίωση των ζώων. Συγκεκριμένα, τα παράθυρα άνοιγαν για το 61,5% και έκλειναν για το 38,5% του χρόνου, εξασφαλίζοντας βέλτιστες συνθήκες με βάση τα δεδομένα των αισθητήρων. Αυτό επέτρεψε τη διατήρηση της θερμοκρασίας όσο το δυνατόν περισσότερο εντός της θερμο-ουδέτερης ζώνης των ζώων, ενώ παράλληλα ρυθμίστηκε η σχετική υγρασία και οι συγκεντρώσεις των επιπέδων αερίων. Όσον αφορά την αξιοποίηση του βιοαερίου, εξετάστηκαν διάφορα σενάρια με διαφορετικά υποστρώματα μέσω αναερόβιας χώνευσης για τον προσδιορισμό του δυναμικού τους σε βιοαέριο, τα οποία προσομοίαζαν διαφορετικές τεχνικές διαχείρισης της κτηνοτροφικής πρακτικής. Το πιο αποδοτικό υπόστρωμα ήταν η τρέχουσα πρακτική με 75% κοπριά προβάτων και 25% άχυρο σιταριού (βάρος/βάρος) και το πιθανό βιοαέριο που θα μπορούσε να παραχθεί από την καθημερινή κοπριά των προβάτων είχε δυναμικό έως και 23678,49 ± 66,96 LBiogas·d-1, ενώ για το άλλο αξιολογούμενο ζωικό είδος (κατσίκια) έως και 14868,5 ± 412,07 LBiogas·d-1 προσφέροντας μια πολλά υποσχόμενη λύση για την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών αναγκών με ταυτόχρονο περιορισμό των εκπομπών αερίων του θερμοκηπίου. Πραγματοποιήθηκε επίσης μια προκαταρκτική ανάλυση μετριασμού των περιβαλλοντικών επιπτώσεων με θεωρητική σύγκριση με άλλα συστήματα θέρμανσης, εάν χρησιμοποιούνταν δυνητικά η ίδια ποσότητα παραγόμενης ενέργειας από βιοαέριο μαζί με τις εκπομπές που προέρχονται από τα απόβλητα, γεγονός που οδήγησε σε ετήσια μείωση των εκπομπών έως και 54,22 και 34,04 tCO2, για τα πρόβατα και τα κατσίκια, αντίστοιχα, λαμβάνοντας υπόψη 180 σταβλισμένα ζώα. Η μείωση των εκπομπών αυξάνεται περαιτέρω αν ληφθεί υπόψη η μείωση της πρόσληψης ξηρής ύλης λόγω του εντερικού μεθανίου και της μειωμένης ποσότητας τροφής, όπως αξιολογήθηκε στην παρούσα διατριβή. Η ενεργειακή ανάλυση διεξήχθη λαμβάνοντας υπόψη την εσωτερική θερμοκρασία του κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου στους 10 °C (βέλτιστη θερμοκρασία των ζώων) και έδειξε ότι ο συνδυασμός του αυτοματοποιημένου συστήματος και ενός θεωρητικού συστήματος θέρμανσης με βιοαέριο κάλυψε το 96,67% των ενεργειακών αναγκών θέρμανσης στην πρώτη ρύθμιση και το 75% στη δεύτερη, με μόνο 14,17% ποσοστό μη κάλυψης για το σύνολο των σεναρίων που αξιολογήθηκαν. Η μελέτη ανέδειξε επίσης τη δυνατότητα χρήσης της πλεονάζουσας ενέργειας βιοαερίου για τη θέρμανση του πόσιμου νερού και την αύξηση της θερμοκρασίας του, συμβάλλοντας στην περαιτέρω βελτίωση της ευημερίας των ζώων. Το προτεινόμενο σύστημα μπορεί να αποτελέσει μια βιώσιμη λύση για τη μείωση και την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών απαιτήσεων κτηνοτροφικών κτιρίων, επιτυγχάνοντας βέλτιστες συνθήκες καλής διαβίωσης των ζώων και μειωμένες εκπομπές αερίων του θερμοκηπίου για βιωσιμότητα και ενεργειακή απόδοση στις κτηνοτροφικές πρακτικές.

The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), Arabian Sea (AS), and Bay of Bengal (BoB) are recognized for hosting the most intense oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), characterized by severe hypoxia at intermediate depths (Gilly et al., 2013; McCreary et al., 2013). The formation of these OMZs is attributed to a complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical processes, many of which exhibit commonalities across all three basins. Enhanced primary productivity in surface waters fosters organic matter export to deeper layers. This organic matter undergoes intensified decomposition at intermediate depths, leading to oxygen depletion through microbial respiration (Breitburg et al., 2018; Gilly et al., 2013; Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; Pennington et al., 2006). Furthermore, sluggish circulation patterns within these basins limit the advection of oxygen-rich waters into the OMZ, and weak vertical mixing restricts oxygen replenishment from the surface (Breitburg et al., 2018; Gilly et al., 2013; Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; McCreary et al., 2013).The Bay of Bengal oxygen minimum zone (BoB-OMZ) deviates from the typical pattern observed in the ETP and AS despite sharing common drivers for OMZ formation (Gilly et al., 2013; McCreary et al., 2013). This disparity underscores the significant influence of regional factors on the BoB-OMZ's characteristics. A key distinction lies in the primary mechanism responsible for its persistence. Microbial processes such as denitrification and anammox are crucial for oxygen consumption in the ETP and AS (Rao et al., 1994; Gilly et al., 2013; Kalvelage et al., 2013; Castro-González et al., 2014). In contrast, the BoB-OMZ primarily owes its existence to intense salinity stratification (Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; Sarma et al., 2018; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021). This stratification effectively traps oxygen-depleted waters, hindering vertical mixing and oxygen replenishment from the surface. Cyclonic eddies further influence the intensity and distribution of the BoB-OMZ (Sarma et al., 2018). Interestingly, anticyclonic eddies can sporadically ventilate the BoB-OMZ with oxygen-rich surface waters, leading to temporary weakening and spatial heterogeneity of the hypoxic zone (Sarma and Udaya Bhaskar, 2018). These contrasting mechanisms, absent in the ETP and AS, contribute to the BoB-OMZ's weaker overall intensity and dynamic nature.The intensity and extent of the BoB-OMZ exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations. In the northern BoB, influenced by major river discharge from the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, the summer monsoon and post-monsoon seasons see intensified salinity stratification, leading to a more pronounced OMZ (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Jana et al., 2015; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021; Sarma et al., 2016). This stratification traps oxygen-depleted waters, hindering vertical mixing and oxygen replenishment. Additionally, the cross-shelf transport of organic matter from the western BoB fuels microbial decomposition, resulting in a stronger OMZ compared to the eastern region (Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021). Recent studies suggest the possibility of even more intense OMZ formation in the northwestern BoB during winter (Bristow et al., 2017), potentially due to enhanced nutrient input from rivers or atmospheric deposition. However, Sridevi and Sarma (2021) propose that these intense episodes might be transient features caused by eddies. Biogeochemically, the BoB-OMZ is considered weaker compared to other regions. This can be attributed to factors such as weak upwelling, limited primary productivity, and rapid sinking of organic carbon to the deep sea, reducing the availability of organic matter for microbial oxygen consumption (Rao et al., 1994; Ittekkot et al., 1991; Naqvi et al., 1996; Ramaiah et al., 2010; McCreary et al., 2013). Furthermore, several studies suggest that riverine nutrients are rapidly consumed within a limited distance (20 km) from the coast, restricting their contribution to offshore OMZ intensification (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Sarma et al., 2018).The Godavari River, India's third-longest fluvial system (1,465 km), is driven by the monsoon cycle, resulting in concentrated discharge from July to September (Central Water Commission, 2019). This peak discharge coincides with the BoB's highest riverine input, contrasting with the dominance of tidal processes in other seasons (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Sarma et al., 2010). While the influence of major rivers such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra on the northern BoB-OMZ is well-established (Jana et al., 2015; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021), the annual impact of medium-sized rivers such as the Godavari remains less explored. This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the annual cycle of Godavari River discharge (GRD), its potential effects on local coastal primary productivity, and its contribution to the development of a seasonal OMZ near the river mouth. The following section outlines the methodology and details the datasets employed. Section 3 presents our findings on the seasonal evolution of the BoB- OMZ, the biogeochemistry in the river mouth region, and the potential mechanisms driving the intense OMZs observed near the Godavari. Finally, section 4 provides a comprehensive summary and concluding remarks. The GRD data utilized in this study were obtained from the Dowleiswaram barrage, located approximately 50 km upstream of the river's confluence with the BoB. This barrage serves as the final major infrastructure point along the Godavari's course, regulating the downstream flow of freshwater into the BoB. Daily measurements of water released from the Dowleiswaram barrage provided a high- resolution record of GRD variations. These daily values were subsequently aggregated to generate monthly mean time series data spanning 29 years (1990-2018). The use of Dowleiswaram barrage discharge as a proxy for total GRD into the BoB is justified due to several factors. First, the barrage captures the vast majority of the Godavari's freshwater input, as evidenced by minimal tributaries downstream. Second, the relatively short distance (50 km) between the barrage and the BoB minimizes potential losses through evaporation or tributary inputs. This time series data of mean monthly GRD serve as a key foundation for our investigation of the river's influence on coastal BoB dynamics. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the GRD data used in this study were not publicly available. The data was obtained from Superintending Engineer, Irrigation Circle, Dhavaleswaram, Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh (https://irrigationap.cgg.gov.in/wrd/home; scicbowlm@gmail.com).This study leverages Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-ARGO) data, a critical component of the Global Ocean Observing System (Notarstefano, 2020), to provide high-resolution in situ station observations in the vicinity of the Godavari River mouth. Within the extensive BGC-ARGO network, we identified two floats (2902264 and 2902193) strategically positioned within the plume of low-saline GRD. The precise locations of these floats are presented in Figure 1, along with their temporal and location information in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S1, S2. These two floats provided individual quality-controlled profiles of various oceanographic parameters. Float 2902193 completed 184 data cycles, with three profiles (cycles 49, 59, and 71) acquired within the vicinity of the GRD region through the fall to early winter (mid-September to December). Float 2902264 completed 268 cycles, with three profiles (cycles 41, 44, and 60) in the GRD region through the fall to the winter months (mid-October to January). Both floats were stationed outside the GRD region for the remaining data cycles. Consequently, only the three profiles acquired within the GRD region, as outlined above, were utilized for the analysis of dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and particle backscattering coefficient information at 700 nm (bb700) in this study. The DO measurements offer insights into potential oxygen depletion associated with enhanced organic matter decomposition driven by the GRD influx. Chl-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, acts as a marker of primary productivity potentially stimulated by nutrient enrichment from the river discharge. Finally, the particle backscattering coefficient serves as an indicator of the presence and type of suspended particles, including phytoplankton and non-living organic matter, which the GRD dynamics can influence. By scrutinizing these critical variables from the strategically located BGC-ARGO floats, we aim to provide robust observational evidence to confirm and refine our understanding of the Godavari River's impact on the biogeochemical dynamics of the coastal BoB region. We obtained BGC-ARGO data from https:// biogeochemical-argo.org/data-access.php. To gain further insights into potential spatial biogeochemical responses to the GRD, we also drew upon complementary datasets from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) (https://www.oceancolour.org/browser/index.php?product=chlor_ a&page=0.=monthly&version=1&limit=24&from=2002- 01-01&to=2016-01-01&mode=download#results). This fresh initiative provides a robust, merged Level 3 product for monthly mean Chl-a concentrations from 2002 to 2016. This valuable resource utilizes satellite observations from diverse sensors, including Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MERIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), seamlessly combined to offer a comprehensive and spatially extensive view of phytoplankton biomass across the global ocean (Sathyendranath et al., 2019). The 4 km spatial resolution of the OC-CCI Chl-a data strikes a balance between capturing local dynamics near the Godavari estuary and providing regional context for the observed patterns. To further elucidate the potential impact of GRD on primary productivity, we also leverage monthly mean net primary productivity (NPP) data obtained from the same OC-CCI website for the same timeframe (2002-2016) (https://www.oceancolour.org/browser/index.php?product=pp&page=0&limit=24&from=2002-01-01&to=2016-01- 01&mode=browse#results). NPP is estimated using the Ocean Production from the Absorption of Light (OPAL) model. This model builds upon the framework originally proposed by Marra et al. (2003). NPP is integrated over the euphotic zone and expressed in grams of carbon per square meter of sea surface (g C m-2). Four key satellite-derived inputs that are assimilated into OPAL are surface Chl- a concentration, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation reaching the ocean surface, and the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter. A detailed description of the NPP calculations is available in O'Reilly (2017). This dataset provides a valuable quantitative estimate of the rate at which organic matter is produced by Chl-a-rich phytoplankton biomass within the coastal BoB region. By analyzing the co-variation between Chl-a, and NPP, we aim to gain insights into the potential stimulation of primary productivity by nutrient enrichment associated with the GRD. The World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18) serves as a cornerstone resource for this study, providing a comprehensive set of objectively analyzed climatological fields for the world ocean (https:// www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/world-ocean-atlas-2018/). These fields, derived from in-situ measurements, encompass various oceanographic parameters at standard depth levels across different grid resolutions (5° × 5°, 1° × 1°, and 0.25° × 0.25°). Specifically, the data includes annual, seasonal, and monthly climatologies of temperature, salinity, DO, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate. The annual and seasonal climatologies extend to an impressive depth of 5,500 m, encompassing 102 distinct vertical levels. However, for monthly climatologies, the data extends only up to 1,500 m (57 vertical levels), still providing valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of near-surface ocean processes. Additionally, the chemical parameters (such as DO, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate) are available only on a 5° × 5° and a 1° × 1° horizontal resolution. This choice balances the need for a detailed spatial resolution within the coastal BoB region with the data availability and reliability constraints inherent in monthly climatologies. In this study, we used the monthly climatological salinity (Zweng et al., 2018) on a 0.25° × 0.25° grid, and dissolved oxygen (Garcia et al., 2019) at a 1° × 1° resolution. By leveraging this robust and authoritative dataset, we aim to gain valuable insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of dissolved oxygen and their potential association with the influence of GRD. The monthly mean horizontal and vertical current data (2000-2020) from the Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) developed by the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is used to elucidate the seasonal dynamics of coastal circulation and upwelling near the Godavari River mouth. This advanced reanalysis product (replacing Reanalysis 6) serves as the initial oceanic state for the NCEP's Climate Forecast System (Saha et al., 2006). The GODAS is forced by the momentum flux, heat flux, and freshwater flux. It utilizes a quasi-global configuration of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) MOM.v3 model, encompassing the critical coastal zone with high-resolution grids (1° x 1°, enhanced to 1/3° near the equator) and 40 vertical levels (10 m resolution in the upper 200 m). Leveraging these capabilities of the GODAS data (https:// www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/GODAS/), we estimated the divergence and upwelling of the GRD region. The divergence field represents the net flow of fluid into or out of a specific region and is calculated as the sum of the partial derivatives of the horizontal velocity components (u and v) with respect to x and y, respectively. Positive divergence leads to upwelling as surface water is drawn away, allowing deeper water to rise and replace it.The monthly distribution of the various physical and biogeochemical fields near the GRD region displays interesting signatures (Supplementary Figures S1–S4). Since a detailed analysis of each month will be too descriptive, we focus on January, April, July, and October to examine the evolution of various fields in the boreal seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. GRD exhibits a strong seasonality driven by the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) season. Monthly climatology (Figure 2A) reveals a peak discharge exceeding 4700 m3.s-1 in August, coinciding with peak SWM rainfall. Subsequently, GRD declines through September, October, and November, becoming negligible by December. Surface salinity distribution (Figure 2B) generally shows a freshening trend during fall due to the equatorward movement of the West India Coastal Current (WICC) transporting low-salinity waters from the northern BoB. Interestingly, GRD also contributes significantly to this freshening during the SWM season, causing a decrease in over 2 practical salinity units (psu) near the river mouth compared to the pre- monsoon values. From summer to winter, salinity becomes the dominant factor controlling near-surface density stratification. This stratification results in a shallow mixed layer and the formation of a thick barrier layer. The shallow mixed layer restricts the exchange of air-sea fluxes, while the barrier layer suppresses mass and energy exchange between the surface layers and the deeper ocean interior. In short, though the relative contribution of fresh water from GRD is negligible compared to other rivers (Sarma et al., 2016), it has the potential to impact the physical and biogeochemical state of the BoB, especially near the Godavari River mouth region. GRD profoundly amplifies spatiotemporal Chl-a dynamics in the BoB during the SWM season (Figure 2C). Pre-monsoon and winter months are characterized by Chl-a concentrations lingering well below 0.4 mg.m-3, indicative of quiescent phytoplankton growth. In stark contrast, the SWM season ushers in a vibrant pulse of primary productivity, propelling Chl-a to peak values exceeding 2.2 mg.m-3 within a significantly expanded spatial footprint encompassing regions up to 83°E around the river mouth (Figure 2C). This pronounced Chl-a bloom intricately mirrors the fluctuations in GRD, diminishing in intensity as the monsoon recedes. The riverine influx of nutrients orchestrates this dramatic seasonal spectacle, directly fueling phytoplankton proliferation and consequently boosting regional NPP, as depicted in Figure 2D. NPP exhibits a gradual ascent from April that culminates at the onset of SWM, and surges beyond 1000 mgC.m-2 by July. However, with the waning of the monsoon and subsequent decline in GRD, NPP undergoes a steep drop, leaving the river mouth region with markedly reduced productivity by October. Thus, the annual peak in GRD serves as a potent force, not only inducing vertical stratification but also transforming the BoB into a highly productive ecosystem during the SWM season. The thriving phytoplankton blooms fueled by enhanced nutrients from the Godavari River are projected to contribute to a significant suspension of organic matter in subsurface BoB waters. To gain insights into this process, we utilized particle backscatter data from two BGC-ARGO floats (2902264 and 2902193) deployed near the river mouth (Figure 1). These floats offered three individual profiles spanning the SWM to winter seasons, allowing us to analyze the organic matter dynamics across contrasting productivity regimes. Details of the data acquisition and processing are provided in Table 1. The BGC-ARGO float 2902264 revealed a pronounced peak in particle backscatter (>0.002 m-1), coinciding with elevated Chl-a concentrations (>3.5 mg m-3) at depths between 30 and 50 m in October 2018 (Figures 1A, B). This peak, located at a depth of 40-50 m, suggests a substantial abundance of organic matter during peak productivity. By November, the intensity of the particle backscatter peak diminished to 0.00165 m-1 at 39 m, accompanied by a reduction in Chl-a to 1.5 mg.m-3 at 37 m. This decline implied a weakening of organic matter abundance as productivity decreased. Notably, while the extreme particle backscatter peaks were absent by January 2019, Chl-a exhibited a secondary peak at 48 m, albeit with a lower magnitude (<0.8 mg.m- 3). This suggests a potential decoupling between Chl-a and organic particle suspension during this period. Data from BGC-ARGO float 2902193 qualitatively support the observed patterns from float 2902264 (Figures 1C, D) in the upper 80 m of the water column. The highest values for both particle backscatter (>0.003 m-1) and Chl-a (>3.5 mg.m-3) were observed during November 2016 (late fall/early winter season) at depths between 25 and 40 m. The peak particle backscatter (>0.003 m-1) occurred at 38 m, while the peak Chl-a (>3.5 mg.m-3) was slightly shallower at 28 m. These elevated values suggest an enhanced production and possible export of organic matter during the fall, following the peak productivity of the SWM. However, the September 2016 data showed lower particle backscatter (<0.0028 m-1) and significantly reduced Chl-a (<1.9 mg.m-3), indicating weaker organic matter suspension preceding the fall peak. Interestingly, while December 2016 exhibited the highest particle backscatter value (>0.0032 m-1) between 85 and 95 m, Chl-a concentrations remained very low (<1 mg.m-3) at depths between 30 and 80 m. This discrepancy suggests a potential decoupling between particle export and phytoplankton biomass at deeper depths during this period. Thus, our analysis of the BGC-ARGO data from both floats indicates a seasonal pattern of enhanced Chl-a inducing an elevated particle backscatter underneath it, along with increased organic matter abundance near the Godavari River mouth region, particularly at depths between 25 and 55 m during the fall season. Furthermore, this abundance appears to be linked to elevated Chl-a and NPP during the preceding SWM season.Hence, GRD significantly impacts the river mouth region during the SWM season through a multifaceted interplay of stratification, primary productivity, and organic matter abundance. The pronounced stratification resulting from a shallow mixed layer and a thick barrier layer generated by GRD restricts vertical mixing, potentially minimizing DO transport from the surface to subsurface layers. Simultaneously, the riverine influx of nutrients fuels phytoplankton growth, leading to enhanced Chl-a concentrations and culminating in elevated NPP. This primary productivity surge drives organic matter export into subsurface layers, potentially capable of influencing DO distribution through microbial decomposition processes. In conclusion, the combined effects of altered stratification, intensified primary productivity at the surface, and organic matter sinking into subsurface layers during the post-SWM season are likely to significantly modify the DO distribution (both horizontal and vertical) near the Godavari River mouth region. The region near the Godavari River mouth lies within the BoB- OMZ, a persistent feature characterized by year-round hypoxic conditions at intermediate depths (200-1,000 m). This section focuses on the potential impact of enhanced organic matter sinking during the SWM and early fall seasons on the distribution of DO and the dynamics (intensity and upper limit) of the BoB-OMZ in the Godavari River mouth region. Analysis of DO profiles from BGC-ARGO floats near the Godavari River mouth reveals the presence of an OMZ (DO within 0-0.5 ml.l-1) between 50 to 800 m (average depth levels), with a dynamic response to seasonal changes in organic matter input (Figure 3). Both floats exhibit a shoaling and intensification of the OMZ during the fall season, indicating a potential influence of riverine flow on DO consumption. At float 2902264, the upper limit of the OMZ deepened from 40-45 m in October 2018 (DO ~ 0 ml.l-1) to 50m in November (DO ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) and to 100 m by January 2019 (DO ~0.5 ml.l-1) (Figure 3A). This pattern suggests a gradual deepening of the OMZ as surface productivity declined and oxygen consumption in subsurface layers for microbial respiration reduced. Float 2902193 exhibited a similar trend, with the upper OMZ boundary at 35-40 m in November 2016 (following the SWM with a DO of ~ 0 ml.l-1), which was as deep as 75 m in September (pre-SWM with a DO of ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) and further down to 105 m in December (with a DO of ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) (Figure 3B). These observations collectively suggest a significant shoaling and intensification of the OMZ near the Godavari River mouth during the fall season. Thus, the enhanced Chl-a and particle backscatter (between 25 and 55 m depth) during the fall season driven by GRD (Figure 1) coincides with shoaling and intensification of the OMZ near the Godavari River mouth. This provides strong evidence for the potential impact of high organic matter sinking on the dynamics of the BoB-OMZ. The limited availability of BGC-ARGO observations in the GRD region restricts our ability to investigate the seasonal evolution of DO. Therefore, we turn to the objectively analyzed WOA18 DO data, despite its coastal data gap. WOA18 offers sufficient coverage (>80% data availability) for a 63-year period (1955-2017), enabling seasonal analysis of various ocean fields. Figures 4A–D display the vertical distribution of DO (surface to 500 m) in the BoB near GRD (16.8°N) during different seasons, derived from WOA18. High DO concentrations (>4-5 ml.l-1) characterize the basin's surface layers (~0-80 m) year-round. Below this, the OMZ prevails, with its upper boundary primarily residing between 80-200 m, exhibiting seasonal and spatial variations. Winter and spring months reveal similar spatial patterns of the OMZ (Figures 4A, B), with its upper limit confined between 80-110 m depth. A pronounced OMZ (DO < 0.3 ml.l-1) persists below 500 m throughout these seasons. Summer (July) exhibits distinct spatial patterns from the previous two seasons (Figure 4C). Except for a narrow depth range (200-250 m, 92.5-93.5°E), DO levels below the mixed layer generally remain above 0.2 ml.l-1. Additionally, the OMZ upper boundary in the western basin deepens to 110-130 m. The fall season witnesses the most profound OMZ expansion and intensification near the western basin, where the Godavari River discharges (Figure 4D). DO levels below 0.1 ml.l-1 appear between 60-175 m in this region, a stark contrast to summer values of 1-1.5 ml.l-1 (Figure 4C). The shoaling and intensification of the OMZ at subsurface depths (40-200 m) near the Godavari River mouth, evident in the BGC- ARGO and WOA18 data during fall, necessitates further investigation. To validate this localized phenomenon, we delved deeper into the seasonal evolution of DO within this critical depth range (40-200 m) in the western BoB (Figures 4E–H). Winter reveals a clear influx of highly oxygenated water from the southern BoB (Figure 4E), aided by the prevailing ocean current system (Figure 2B). This influx maintains sufficient DO (>1 ml.l-1) in the western BoB throughout winter and spring (Figures 4E, F). Even in summer (July) (Figure 4G), subsurface DO (averaged over 40-200 m) near the Godavari River mouth remains moderate, exceeding 1.2 ml.l-1. However, a dramatic shift occurs in the fall (October) as the region transforms into an oxygen-depleted zone (<0.5 ml.l-1) (Figure 4H). This stark contrast highlights the dynamic seasonal cycle of subsurface DO in the western BoB. While oxygenated waters prevail near the Godavari delta basin during winter, spring, and summer, a localized and intense OMZ establishes itself near the river mouth during fall. Thus, coinciding with the retreat of the SWM season, the confluence of increased organic matter input from the Godavari River and enhanced stratification likely contributes to the generation of an intense and shallow subsurface OMZ (40-200 m) near the river mouth. The genesis and dynamics of the pronounced subsurface OMZ observed near the GRD region after the retreat of the SWM season are likely influenced by a complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical factors. In this section, we focus on analyzing other processes such as surface ocean circulation and divergence in the western BoB near the GRD region (Figure 5) using GODAS data, recognizing their crucial role in upwelling and associated biogeochemical processes influencing OMZ dynamics. The surface circulation in the western BoB exhibits distinct seasonal patterns near the Godavari River mouth, playing a crucial role in regional upwelling and potentially influencing the observed OMZ dynamics. The pre-Southwest Monsoon and SWM seasons are characterized by strong northward coastal currents and an eastward current across the BoB, as shown in Figures 5B, C, respectively. Additionally, during the SWM season, south-westerly winds induce positive divergence along the western BoB coast, favoring coastal upwelling (Figure 5C). Following the retreat of the SWM season, the strong monsoon currents subside, and southward- moving coastal currents dominate the western BoB (Figure 5D). This shift creates favorable conditions for upwelling near the GRD region and northwards, indicated by positive surface divergence (Figure 5D). Winter (January) sees a further weakening of the southward current, and positive divergence persists near the GRD region, suggesting continued upwelling potential (Figure 5A). Thus the oceanic region near the GRD experiences favorable conditions for upwelling throughout the SWM, fall, and late winter periods due to the combined influence of surface currents and divergence. This sustained upwelling could potentially contribute to the observed surge in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), NPP, and the subsequent intensification and vertical expansion (shoaling) of the OMZ observed after the retreat of the SWM season. To provide insights into the interplay between GRD and upwelling in shaping dissolved DO and OMZ dynamics in the BoB, we selected two geographically distinct study regions. Box A (82-84°E, 15.5-17°N) lies directly at the Godavari River mouth, maximizing its exposure to GRD influence and benefiting from favorable upwelling conditions during the SWM season. In contrast, Box B (84-86°E, 17-18.5°N), located slightly north, experiences minimized GRD influence while retaining similar upwelling conditions during the SWM season. This strategic selection allows for a comparative analysis, disentangling the individual and combined effects of GRD and upwelling on DO and OMZ dynamics. Figure 6 represents the seasonal evolution of vertical velocity (GODAS data), and those of Chl-a (OC-CCI data), NPP (OC-CCI), and depth-averaged (40-200 m) dissolved oxygen (WOA18 data) in these two selected oceanic regions. The analysis unfolds similar qualitative patterns for vertical velocity (upwelling) in both boxes. In both the oceanic regions, upwelling increases with the emergence of the SWM season and starts declining with its withdrawal. In comparison, Box A records higher values for upwelling than Box B (Figure 6A). The highest upwelling was recorded in July in both boxes, 0.72×10-5 m.s-1 in Box A and 0.58×10-5 m.s-1 in Box B. The increase in upwelling during the SWM season clearly reflects the seasonal evolution of Chl-a in Box A, whereas Box B shows a slight decreasing trend from June to July, although it maintained an overall increasing trend during the SWM season (Figure 6B). Both the regions reflected mild Chl-a values during rest of the year. In comparison, Chl-a blooms in Box A (0.8-0.9 mg.m-3) were almost twice as intense as Box B (0.4-0.5 mg.m-3) during the SWM season. NPP also showed a similar seasonal signature (Figure 6C). Both boxes highlighted an increasing trend in NPP during the SWM season and showed similar patterns during the rest of the year. Similar to the Chl-a distribution, Box A recorded very high (> 1100 mgC.m-3) NPP distribution compared to Box B (< 850 mgC.m-3) during the SWM season. The rise in Chl- a and NPP during the SWM season significantly impacted seasonal DO fluctuations in both study regions (Figure 6D). While DO exhibited a mildly increasing trend in both boxes during late winter and pre-monsoon, it displayed a substantial decline with the onset of the SWM season. In Box A, DO plummeted from 3 ml.l-1 in May to a critical low of 0.1 ml.l-1 in October (fall), representing a drastic decrease of 2.9 ml.l-1. In contrast, Box B experienced a smaller decline, with DO decreasing from 2.2 ml.l-1 in June to an average of 0.55 ml.l-1 during fall (September-November), representing a decrease of 1.75 ml.l-1. In conclusion, it is evident that SWM- driven biogeochemical activity was significantly enhanced in Box A, directly influenced by GRD, leading to pronounced oxygen consumption during fall. This comparative analysis highlights the crucial role of GRD in shaping DO and OMZ dynamics in the BoB. This study delves into the profound biogeochemical impact of GRD in the BoB, with a particular focus on the region near the river mouth. Our key finding is the intriguing presence of an intense and shallow OMZ within the subsurface (40-200 m) depths near the Godavari River mouth during the post-monsoon season which has hardly been mentioned previously. Notably, this phenomenon differs from the conventional intermediate-depth BoB-OMZ prevalent in the basin (McCreary et al., 2013). The temporal evolution of this shallow OMZ was elucidated through data from two BGC-ARGO floats located close to the river discharge region. Their observations revealed a clear intensification and shoaling of the OMZ during fall. To unveil the spatial extent and context of this phenomenon, we leveraged the broader coverage of WOA18 data, facilitating comparisons with other crucial variables. Furthermore, to disentangle the relative influence of GRD and upwelling on OMZ dynamics, we conducted a comparative analysis in two geographically distinct locations. This comparative analysis proved the pivotal role of GRD in shaping the biogeochemical environment near the river mouth. Despite both regions experiencing similar upwelling patterns, the area directly influenced by GRD exhibited significantly higher Chl-a blooms, enhanced NPP during the SWM season, and a more pronounced oxygen consumption during fall. These observations strongly suggest that the extensive nutrient influx from GRD fuels increased primary productivity, leading to enhanced organic matter suspension and subsequent oxygen depletion in the subsurface layers, culminating in the observed intense and shallow OMZ. Our findings paint a compelling picture of the substantial influence of GRD on BoB biogeochemistry, particularly in the vicinity of the river mouth. Briefly, during the SWM season, the influx of nutrients from GRD, combined with enhanced coastal upwelling, creates favorable conditions for phytoplankton blooms. These blooms, peaking in August and September, are characterized by high Chl-a concentrations and lead to a surge in NPP. However, this elevated productivity comes with a subsequent cost. As the blooms senesce and decompose by fall, an elevation in suspended organic matter at the subsurface depths (40-200 m) develops. This organic matter fuels the activity of heterotrophic microbial communities, leading to intense oxygen consumption through respiration. This microbial respiration, coupled with the reduced atmospheric oxygen supply due to strong stratification, drives the shoaling and intensification of the OMZ off the Godavari River mouth. Understanding and quantifying these impacts are crucial for various reasons. First, alterations in GRD can directly affect primary productivity and food webs in the coastal zone. Second, changes in the OMZ's intensity can influence the release of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and N2O, potentially impacting global climate change. Finally, understanding the dynamic interplay between riverine inputs, upwelling, and biogeochemical processes is critical for predicting and managing the future state of the BoB ecosystem. In summary, although the discharge of the Godavari River is negligible compared to other rivers flowing into the BoB, GRD plays a pivotal role in shaping the biogeochemistry of the bay, with profound impacts on primary productivity, oxygen dynamics, and greenhouse gas emissions. Further research is needed to fully understand the intricate interactions between GRD, upwelling, and biogeochemical processes, and to predict the consequences of future alterations in riverine inputs on this vital ecosystem. It should, however, be noted that the interpretations derived from our analysis are subject to the limited temporal and spatial sample extent, which precludes us from any statistical significance test of the results. We are in the process of initiating a few high-resolution sensitivity experiments with the ocean model that will be 15-20 years long. The outputs will enable us to quantify the contributions of each parameter separately.
