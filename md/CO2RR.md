Compared with the large number of publications devoted to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysed by polyoxometalates (POMs), the electrocatalysis of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CDRR) by these molecular catalysts has been only marginally explored. At first glance, this may seem surprising in view of their remarkable electron transfer properties which can be finely tuned by molecular engineering to fit the different proton-assisted multielectron reduction potentials for CO 2 . The possible combination of CO 2 with POMs in the form of coordination complexes appears, however, to be a promising route to develop POM-based electrocatalytic assemblies able to selectively drive CDRR. In this chapter, we provide an up-to-date description of more or less promising examples dealing with CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs in homogeneous (POMs dissolved in the electrolyte solution) and supported (POMs-modified (photo)electrodes) phases. This shows that promoting CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs with excellent performance metrics (efficiency, selectivity and stability) represents a current challenge. As a representative example, a POM-modified electrode that delivers high electrocatalytic current density (>10 mA cm −2 ) and is highly selective for CDRR has yet to be discovered.

Abstract This study builds upon the evolving landscape of sustainable construction practices, where optimizing ready-mix concrete for strength, cost-efficiency, and reduced CO2 emissions is crucial in aligning with global environmental sustainability targets. Through an extensive analysis of diverse input parameters, including water-cement ratio, aggregate characteristics, additives, and their interactions with critical output parameters, this research has unveiled a substantial dependence on concrete performance, cost-efficiency, and environmental impact on cement selection and proportioning. This research emphasizes the pivotal role of cement in determining both the cost and CO2 emissions of concrete production, highlighting a notable positive correlation between cement content and compressive strength (R2 = 0.4946), and an even more pronounced correlation with CO2 emissions (R2 = 0.9529). This underlines the importance of optimizing cement use for balanced performance. Furthermore, the study reveals that while admixtures play a limited role in enhancing compressive strength (R2 = 0.0426), their impact on other concrete properties like workability and durability is significant. The optimization of concrete components, including a strategic reduction in admixture use, can lead to considerable cost and CO2 emission reductions, exemplified by a 5% cost decrease and a 7% drop in emissions with a 20% admixture reduction. Overall, these findings highlight the transformative impact of AI in concrete mix design, paving the way for more sustainable construction methods and contributing to global efforts to reduce the infrastructure sector's carbon footprint.

Thermal motor emissions have grown cold and colder over time thanks to the betterment of the yield of motors. This contributes to an inversion of behaviour of CO2, since photosynthesis is endothermic, absorbs heat together with it. New CO2 emissions are coldening the climate where thermal motor efficiency is good. This is confirmed with AI support and shown to explain the late snows this Spring in Europe, as well as the “La Niña” trend that has been announced. Global warming can be totally reduced and reversed with a consistent pattern of smart CO2 emissions, without the heat associated, thanks to new thermally efficient motors.

## Life Cycle Carbon Assessment of Mortars with Carbonated and Non-Carbonated Recycled Aggregates

Global warming is one of the most important issues that the world is currently facing. The cement industry accounts for around 7% of total global CO2 emissions. According to the 13th United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, cement plants must become carbon neutral by 2050. This neutrality may be achieved by a reduction in CO2 emissions complemented with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies. In accordance with these sustainable goals, several approaches have been studied. This paper investigates life cycle carbon of mortars produced with carbonated recycled aggregates. In previous works, the carbon dioxide capture capacity of construction and demolition waste (CDW) was analysed, and mortars with CDW recycled aggregates submitted to high levels of CO2 were evaluated in terms of their mechanical performance. This paper focus on the life cycle carbon impact assessment (LCCA) of industrial mortar formulations in a cradle-to-gate boundary. This assessment is carried out through a global warming potential environment impact assessment, since it represents the amount of CO2 equivalent that is sent to the atmosphere and contributes to the “greenhouse effect”. This LCCA includes the impacts associated with the treatment and additional transportation routes of the recycled aggregates. With this work, it was found that mortars with carbonated recycled aggregates have a considerably lower global warming potential impact than mortars without recycled aggregates. The mortars with recycled aggregates presented lower CO2 emissions of up to 6.31% for 100% incorporation of non-carbonated recycled aggregates. These values were incremented with the carbonation of the recycled aggregates, achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 36.75% for 100% of incorporation.

Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction. Herein, a unique Co‐N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2'‐bipyridine and triazine‐containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy‐COF‐Co enabled a record‐high CO production rate of 426 mmol g‐1 h‐1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607 h−1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8:1‐1:16). A systematical investigation including operando synchrotron X‐ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in‐situ attenuated total reflection surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine‐based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co‐N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF‐derived single‐atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.

The application of carbon dioxide (CO2) in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects is becoming increasingly more interesting in the petroleum industry because it can boost oil production rates while potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The injected CO2 causes oil swelling and viscosity reduction, making it easier to flow through the reservoir fractures. This article studies the performance of the first EOR CO2 project in Croatia, which started operations in 2014 with a capacity of 0.41 million tons per year (Mtpa). The CO2 source is a natural gas processing plant, which released the CO2 into the atmosphere prior to the EOR project. Now, this CO2 is continuously captured, compressed, transported, liquefied, and injected into the EOR fields of Ivanić and Žutica. Tertiary (EOR) oil recovery at these two oil fields is expected to raise the oil recovery factors up to 55% from the previously achieved 9% in the primary stage and 36% in the secondary stage. Besides the EOR project, this article reviews other carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects in Croatia, for the cement industry, power generation, and biofuel production. All these projects combined could bring the total CCUS capacity up to 1.843 Mtpa by 2030.

This paper aims to verify the possibility of utilising water-in-diesel emulsions (WiDE) as an alternative drop-in fuel for diesel engines. An 8% WiDE was produced to be tested in a four-stroke, indirect injection (IDI) diesel engine and compared to EN590 diesel fuel. An eddy current brake and an exhaust gas analyser were utilised to measure different engine parameters such as torque, fuel consumption, and emissions at different engine loads. The results show that the engine running on emulsified fuel leads to a reduction in torque and power, an increase in the specific fuel consumption, and slightly better thermal efficiency. The highest percentual increment of thermal efficiency for WiDE is obtained at 100% engine load, 5.68% higher compared to diesel. The emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are reduced, but carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) emissions are increased, compared to traditional diesel fuel. The most substantial decrease in NO and CO2 levels was achieved at 75% engine load with 33.86% and 25.08% respectively, compared to diesel.

The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is one of the most promising ways to valorise CO2 as a source of carbon. The development of novel, efficient and scalable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction within electrolysers is still a big challenge. Here, we report the preparation of sustainable, efficient and stable gas diffusion electrodes utilizing Ag as catalyst for the CO2 electroreduction to CO. These cathodic materials are prepared by sputter deposition and subjected to post-deposition modification using dry, reactive processes. The catalyst is uniformly deposited as a thin layer on the porous structure of PTFE minimizing the amount of Ag required. This approach allows for fine tuning of the morphology, chemical composition and loading of Ag and their impact on the CO2RR. These electrodes have been evaluated for the CO2 electroreduction and for electrocatalytic studies in a flow reactor with gas-fed CO2. The optimized electrodes show high activity, with current densities > 20 mA/cm2 at -1,18 V vs. RHE, and faradaic efficiency for CO > 90 %. The stability was tested over periods up to 24 hours showing a significant impact of the post-deposition modification. Higher porosity, roughness and electrochemical surface area have been achieved after the modification. Noteworthy, our approach allows for outstanding performances using a minimal amount of metal, while using the processing advantages of sputtering as an industrial state-of-the-art, high-throughput, and roll-to-roll compatible technique. Moreover, this route enables the deposition of different metals and alloys of tailored composition for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction beyond CO.

The air–fuel ratio is a crucial parameter in internal combustion engines that affects optimal engine performance, emissions, fuel efficiency, engine durability, power, and efficiency. Positive pressure ventilators (PPVs) create specific operating conditions for drive units, characterized by a reduced ambient pressure compared to standard atmospheric pressure, which is used to control carburetor-based fuel supply systems. The impact of these conditions was investigated for four commonly used PPVs (with internal combustion engines) in fire services across the European Union (EU), using a lambda (λ), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen carbon (HC) analyser for exhaust gases. All four ventilators were found to operate with lean and very lean mixtures, with their lambda coefficients ranging from 1.6 to 2.2. The conducted tests of the CO2, CO, and HC concentrations in the exhaust gases of all four fans show dependencies consistent with theoretical analyses of the impact of the fuel–air mixture on emissions. It can be observed that as the amount of burned air decreases, the values of CO and HC decrease, while the concentration of CO2 increases with the increase in engine load. Such an operation can accelerate engine wear, increase the emission of harmful exhaust gases, and reduce the effective performance of the device. This condition is attributed to an inadequate design process, where drive units are typically designed to operate within atmospheric pressure conditions, as is common for these engines. However, when operating with a PPV, the fan’s rotor induces significant air movement, leading to a reduction in ambient pressure on the intake side where the engine is located, thereby disrupting its proper operation.

(1) Efforts on harnessing excess emitted CO2 back to the carbon cycle via chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical pathways have seen steady development to produce value-added chemicals for energy storage. (1,2) Among them, an environmentally benign electroreduction approach is the most promising one for valorization of CO2 as fuels and chemicals, albeit the fact that sluggish kinetics and lack of selectivity require the design of suitable catalysts. (3,4) Molecular electrocatalysts have well-defined active sites and accurately tailorable structures that allow mechanism-based performance optimization. Among them, several are based on easily available first-row transition metals to catalyze CO2 reduction (CO2RR) via a 2e–/2H+ mechanism to form CO and HCOOH. (5) Nevertheless, examples of molecular catalysts capable of reducing CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ (e.g., multielectron products) are scarce. A key reason for that is the difficulty in controlling the binding affinity of the catalyst-bound CO intermediate, which often plays a pivotal role in the generation of multielectron/multiproton products. (5,6) Along with this, the complexity of the multielectron/multiproton pathways involving multiple intermediates provides a limited understanding of the reaction mechanism. (5,7) Herein, we would like to highlight several recently reported strategies that show promising CO2RR activity and selectivity toward products beyond 2e–/2H+, such as (i) immobilization of functionalized molecular catalysts over conductive supports, (ii) incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding groups proximal to the active site, and (iii) the use of light illumination during electrochemical CO2RR in molecular catalysts incorporated within porous hybrid platforms.Initially, Wang et al. reported one of the first examples of a molecular electrocatalyst reducing CO2 to value-added multielectron hydrocarbons. They immobilized a cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst (CoPc, Figure 1a) over multiwalled carbon-nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNTs) and used it as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst that, in aqueous solution, undergoes 6e–/6H+ CO2RR to generate CH3OH. (5) They first compared the catalytic performance of CNT-immobilized iron, cobalt, and nickel phthalocyanine (FePc, CoPc, and NiPc, respectively), as metal-to-CO binding energy, EB(CO), varies with different M–N4, spanning over a range of 1.2 eV and found that cobalt provides moderate CO binding. Therefore, among all three catalysts, only CoPc produced MeOH with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 44% at −0.94 V vs RHE (CO and H2 being the major products for FePc and NiPc). Through scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis they have shown that CoPc has molecular level dispersion over the CNT, which is vital for MeOH formation. Otherwise, physical mixtures of CoPc and CNTs showed much less reactivity, despite having higher CoPc content. According to their observation, at lower overpotential, CO was the major CO2RR product, and thus, it was postulated that CO acts as a reactive intermediate toward MeOH formation. Indeed, when an electrocatalytic CO reduction reaction (CORR) using CoPc/MWCNT was performed, it produced MeOH with a FE of 28% at −0.77 V vs RHE. Overall, catalysis goes through a "domino" process where CO2 first reduces to CO, and then undergoes another 4e–/4H+ reduction to MeOH, and the potential-dependent steps of both CO2RR and CORR are very similar. Nonetheless, this catalytic system suffers from rather limited durability. Upon only 1 h of electrolysis, FECH3OH decreased by 18%, while after 4 h of electrolysis, MeOH formation became negligible. UV–visible spectra of the postelectrolysis CoPc molecule from the electrode revealed an undesired reduction of the Pc ligand, eventually leading to hydrogenation of the macrocycle. To avoid the reductive deactivation, Wang and co-workers introduced four electron-donating amino groups in the β position of the CoPc moiety (Figure 1b, CoPc-NH2), which successfully lowered the overpotential and could sustain activity for a longer time with a maximum FECH3OH of 32%.Figure 1Figure 1.

Copyright 2023 Authors.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideAt about the same time, Robert et al. also used the CoPc catalyst and MWCNT mixture with a Nafion binder over carbon paper for the conversion of CO2 to MeOH. (8) Under heterogeneous conditions in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution (pH = 7.2), they obtained only 0.3% FECH3OH at −0.88 V vs RHE, which increased to 2% when they used CO as substrate instead of CO2. However, at pH 13, when CO was used as a substrate, the same CoPc/MWCNT system exhibited 14.3% FECH3OH at −0.68 V vs RHE, i.e., a 50-fold increase in selectivity at a 170 mV lower overpotential, along with a 10-fold increase in catalytic rate. Subsequent HPLC experiments showed that during CORR at pH 13, formaldehyde (HCHO) is formed. At alkaline pH, there is a chance of Cannizzaro reaction, i.e., a disproportionation of HCHO (aldehyde without α hydrogens) to CH3OH and HCOO– causing an overestimation of CH3OH's FE determination. Knowing that, Robert and co-workers carefully evaluated these nonfaradaic CH3OH formations and concluded that their effect is negligible. In addition, a series of control experiments, along with Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the CoPc before and after electrolysis proved that the observed reactivity was not due to the decomposition of CoPc into metallic Co nanoparticles, thus signifying the molecular nature of the catalyst.Lately, McCrory et al. further investigated the catalytic properties of the CoPc/MWCNT system using a gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) flow-cell. Compared to a conventional H-cell configuration, performing the electrocatalytic reaction in a CO2-fed GDE setup showed appreciably suppressed activity toward MeOH formation. The key explanation for these results lies at the higher CO2 binding affinity of CoPc compared to its affinity to bind CO, as quantitatively measured in this study. (6) The authors varied the partial current density of MeOH (product of CORR) at −0.70 V vs RHE as a function of the partial pressure of CO (PCO), which ultimately reached a plateau at PCO = 1. Thereafter, using a microkinetic analysis, the binding constant of CO to CoPc (KCO) was determined to be 3.0 atm–1. On the contrary, in the case of a CO2RR reaction with CoPc (where the major product is CO), extracted KCO2 was 11.1 atm–1. The high binding constant ratio of KCO2/KCO = 3.7, provides a thermodynamic explanation for the inefficient MeOH formation on CoPc/MwCNTs during CO2RR, where catalyst-bound CO is preferentially displaced by CO2 molecules before it can be further reduced. Thus, the authors suggested that researchers should look forward in the direction of controlling the local concentration of CO2 by construction of catalyst–polymer composites, or via applying modifications to the coordination environments of CoPc. These strategies will strengthen the CO binding, especially when using GDE flow-cells.As opposed to CoPc, in case of metal porphyrins, up until recently, reports of CO2 reduction into multielectron compounds were only available when conducted under photochemical conditions. (10,11) Lately, however, Dey and co-workers designed a distal superstructure in the molecular framework of iron porphyrins, and were able to stop the dissociation of CO from the metal-bound intermediate and simultaneously activated it for further reduction. In this work, an iron porphyrin having a distal basic pyridine residue was synthesized (FeL2, Figure 1C) and used as homogeneous electrocatalyst for CO reduction to CH4, with 93% FE. (2) Spectro-electrochemistry coupled FTIR (FTIR-SEC) was employed to understand the mechanism of the reaction with in situ detection of the metal–carbonyl species, using 12/13CO isotope sensitive absorption. In CO-saturated CH3CN containing 3% H2O, they identified an FeII–CO species being reduced to FeI–CO at applied potential of −1.75 V vs Fc/Fc+, followed by the reduction of FeI–CO to Fe0-CO at −2.35 V vs Fc/Fc+. Interestingly, while holding the potential at −2.35 V for a long period, an FeII–CHO adduct was detected, which then could be further reduced to CH4. In this case, pyridine mediated hydrogen-bonding between water molecules (i.e., proton source) and FeI–CO intermediate allows its stabilization, and activation for further reduction to CH4 (as evidenced by DFT calculation).In another attempt to achieve multielectron CO2 reduction using porphyrins, our group adopted a different approach, based on a photoassisted electrocatalysis pathway for multiproton/multielectron CO2RR. To do so, we have utilized photoactive Co-porphyrin (CoTCPP)-based metal–organic framework (MOF) films (Co-MOF-525). Under 1-sun light illumination (100 mW/cm2), the MOF film can sustain large quantities of long-lived oxidized charged carriers during photocathodic operation and performed a 8e–/8H+ reduction of CO2 to CH4 (in 80/20 (%v/v) CH3CN–H2O with a LiClO4 electrolyte). (9) Subsequent, photoassisted chronoamperometric measurements revealed that in the potential window of −0.39 to −0.64 V, CH4 and CO were produced during CO2RR, with a maximum FECH4 being 14% at −0.49 V, while FECO was only 2%. Yet, in the absence of light illumination, both products were formed in a very negligible amount. At more cathodic potentials, a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) became more prominent and significantly suppressed CO2RR. Generally, CoITCPP is the CO2RR active state that binds CO2 and undergoes 2e–/2H+ reduction to CO. However, thin layer spectro-electrochemical measurements revealed a different mechanism that leads to the unexpected CH4 production. Under dark electrolysis conditions, spectro-electrochemistry analysis showed the formation of bands attributed to CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+, while measurements at more cathodic potentials showed the formation of a new band corresponding to CO2RR active species, [CoITCPP]−. Surprisingly, in photoassisted electrolysis conditions, the formation of a broad band at 460 nm was noticed, suggesting the existence of a higher oxidation form of the catalyst, namely, [CoIIITCPP]2+, which was the product of a porphyrin ring oxidation. Here, with an increase in the cathodic potential, the [CoIIITCPP]2+ band decreased in intensity, while the CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+ bands remained unchanged throughout the course of the reaction. In other words, in these conditions, MOF-525 maintains a high concentration of [CoIIITCPP]+ species (via photo-oxidative accumulation of holes), which is known to stabilize CO by preferentially binding with it, (12) a crucial step that allows its further reduction to CH4.To conclude, despite severe challenges posed in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multielectron products, successful reports of molecular catalysts capable of CO2RR beyond 2e–/2H+ have increased lately. The results highlighted herein could help pave the way toward (i) rational catalyst design, (ii) improved structure–function correlation studies, and (iii) identification of key mechanistic factors necessary to understand molecular catalyst operation both in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous configurations. Nevertheless, realizing the next-generation of molecular catalytic systems will have to involve new approaches for the stabilization of key reactive intermediates while developing means for their assembly onto porous functional supports that allows the incorporation of secondary-sphere interactions to stir the CO2RR path toward the desired products.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsArnab Ghatak - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3027-9359; Email: [email protected]Idan Hod - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4837-8793; Email: [email protected]Author ContributionsThe manuscript was written through contribution of all the authors.

Predicting carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for addressing climate change and achieving environmental sustainability. Accurate emission forecasts provide policymakers with a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of policies, facilitating the design and implementation of emission reduction strategies, and helping businesses adjust their operations to adapt to market changes. Various methods, such as statistical models, machine learning, and grey prediction models, have been widely used in carbon dioxide emission prediction. However, existing research often lacks comparative analysis with other forecasting techniques. This paper constructs a new Discrete Fractional Accumulation Grey Gompertz Model (DFAGGM(1,1) based on grey system theory and provides a detailed solution process. The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is used to find the hyperparameters in the model. By comparing it with five benchmark models, the effectiveness of DFAGGM(1,1) in predicting carbon dioxide emissions data for China and the United States is validated.

This study compares thermodynamics, economics, and environmental performance of cascaded ORCs operated under a single and dual fluids. In the single fluid cascaded ORC, toluene, benzene, acetone and cyclopentane are run in high and low temperature cycles, whereas in dual fluid cascaded ORC, toluene, benzene, acetone and cyclopentane are run in high temperature cycle and R601a in the low temperature cycle. The analysis compares variations in expander inlet temperature and condensation temperature. Thermodynamic performance involved net power output (Pnet) and thermal efficiency (ηth), while economic indicators included net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In environmental performance, the annual reduction in carbon dioxide emission (CO2-eq) is assessed. The findings revealed that dual fluid cascaded ORC generated the highest Pnet of 1245.11 kW while single fluid cascaded ORC reached 1170.27 kW. The dual fluid cascaded ORC showed the significant increase in Pnet (%DPnet) for about 43% at the lowest expander inlet temperature (500 K). In terms of ηth, dual fluid cascaded ORC attained 37.23 % while single fluid cascaded ORC reached 33.25%. It is further found that acetone+R601a performed well in dual fluid cascaded ORC, resulting in the highest Pnet and allowing system’s NPV to turn positive sooner than other fluids. Furthermore, cyclopentane+R601a had the lowest LCOE of 0.0158 US$/kWh, which is 1.1% lower compared to the single fluid cascaded ORC and competitive in the Thai electricity market. In environmental saving, dual fluid cascaded ORC reduced about 144.96 tCO2-eq/year, and outperformed single fluid cascaded ORC by roughly 6.39%.

The increasing carbon dioxide emissions from human activities present a significant global concern, with approximately two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions attributed to household activities. The Carbon Generalized System of Preferences (CGSP) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism to incentivize voluntary carbon reduction in community households. This paper examines the development of a community digital management platform designed to incentivize voluntary carbon reduction at the community level, highlighting the critical role of reducing emissions in urban community life to meet carbon peak and neutrality targets. This study employs the TAO model of Three-Way Decision to establish a closed-loop operational framework for the CGSP digital platform. The platform features a Trisection mechanism to record and quantify low-carbon behaviors, an Action mechanism to classify and reward community members, and an Outcome mechanism to assess overall community carbon reduction achievements. Additionally, a user interface tailored for community users is developed to enhance platform accessibility. The proposed platform presents a practical and innovative solution for exploring emission reduction potential in urban communities. By systematically recording low-carbon behaviors, providing targeted rewards, and conducting comprehensive assessments, the platform aims to guide community residents in adopting sustainable practices. This study offers a valuable reference for the digital transformation, intelligent system construction, and development of new urban functional units within communities.

To address the increasingly severe issue of carbon dioxide emissions, the Chinese government has set dual carbon goals: achieving peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Studying the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions is crucial for achieving these dual carbon goals and promoting sustainable development. Using balanced panel data from 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region from 2006 to 2019, this paper empirically analyzed the relationship and mechanisms of highway transportation infrastructure’s impact on carbon emissions using fixed effects models, mediating effects models, and threshold effects models. The empirical results indicate: (1) there is a nonlinear inverted-U-shaped relationship between highway transportation infrastructure and carbon emissions; (2) highway transportation infrastructure indirectly affects carbon emissions through foreign direct investment as a mediating variable; (3) the threshold effect model verifies that the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions exhibits threshold effects based on green technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. This study enriches the research content in related fields to some extent and provides specific policy recommendations for achieving carbon reduction goals and promoting sustainable development.

Toluene is a pollutant frequently detected in contaminated groundwater, mostly due to leakage from underground gasoline storage tanks and pipeline ruptures. Multi-element compound-specific isotope analysis provides a framework to understand transformation processes and design efficient remediation strategies. In this study, we enriched an anaerobic bacterial culture derived from a BTEX-contaminated aquifer that couples toluene and phenol oxidation with nitrate reduction and the concomitant production of carbon dioxide and biomass. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon data indicated that the toluene-degrading consortium was dominated by an Aromatoleum population (87 ± 2 % relative abundance), and metagenome sequencing confirmed that the genome of this Aromatoleum sp. encoded glycyl-radical enzyme benzylsuccinate synthase (BssABC) and phenylphospate synthase (PpsA1BC) homologous genes involved in the first step of toluene and phenol transformation, respectively. Carbon and hydrogen isotopic fractionation were ε

Given the great significance of defect and Cu compounds for the reduction of CO2 as well as the few reaction mechanisms of converting CO2 into different hydrocarbons, the effects of oxygen vacancies and Cu2O on the reduction of CO2 were thoroughly investigated, and possible mechanisms were also proposed. A series of Cu2O/Ov-MgO catalysts were synthesized for photothermal catalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol under visible-light irradiation, among which the 7%Cu2O/Ov-MgO composite exhibited the best reduction activity and the yield of methanol was 19.78 μmol·g–1·h–1. The successful composite of Cu2O and Ov-MgO can yield a loose and porous nanosheet, uniform distribution, favorable absorbance and photoelectric performance, and increased specific surface area and adsorption ability of CO2, which are all vital to the adsorption and conversion of CO2. The introduction of oxygen vacancy and Cu2O not only promotes the adsorption of CO2 but also provides more electron-triggered CO2 activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also performed to reveal the reaction mechanism for effective enhanced CO2 reduction to ethanol or methanol by the comparison of CuO/MgO and Cu2O/Ov-MgO composites, illustrating the reaction pathways of different products. By comparing the key steps in determining the selectivity of C1 or C2, the kinetic barriers of obtaining CH3OH for the Cu2O/Ov-MgO composite with CH3OH as the main product were found to be lower than those of generating CH2*, while the opposite is true for CuO/MgO composites, whereby it may be easier to obtain more C2 products. These insights into the reaction mechanism of converting CO2 into different hydrocarbons are expected to provide guidance for the further design of high-performance photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction catalysts.

Abstract. A growing body of evidence suggests that to achieve the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will likely be required in addition to massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions. Nature-based CDR, which includes a range of strategies to sequester carbon in natural reservoirs, could play an important role in efforts to limit climate warming to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels. Agricultural CDR could enhance soil carbon sequestration, though the climate efficacy of such methods remains uncertain. Here, we use an intermediate complexity climate model to perform simulations of agricultural CDR in the form of soil carbon sequestration at a range of possible rates for different costs under three future emissions scenarios. We found that plausible levels of agricultural CDR were able to reduce CO2 concentration by 5–19 ppm and global surface air temperature by 0.02–0.10 °C by the end of century. This temperature decrease was non-linear with respect to cumulative removals, as any carbon removed remained part of the active carbon cycle, lessening the climate benefit compared to if the removed carbon was permanently stored in geological reservoirs. CDR was found to be more effective at reducing surface air temperature in low emissions scenarios, but less effective at reducing atmospheric CO2, compared to high emissions scenarios. This was because the weaker CO2 sinks in a high CO2 world had a more muted response to removal, so a substantially higher proportion of carbon was removed from the atmosphere for a given amount of CDR in a higher emissions scenario. The enhanced temperature response to CDR in lower emissions scenarios was due to the logarithmic response of radiative effects to changes in CO2, where at low atmospheric CO2 concentrations, small changes in CO2 are more effective at changing the global radiative balance than at higher CO2 concentrations. CDR was substantially more effective when implemented at a higher rate, as CDR makes a proportionally larger difference in a climate with lower cumulative air fraction of CO2. Land and soil carbon responses were driven by the scenario-dependent balances between the impacts of CDR on primary productivity from CO2 fertilization, and the impacts on soil respiration from increased soil carbon availability and global temperatures.

Abstract Limiting the global warming impact requires a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to reach a zero-carbon growth by 2050. Against this backdrop, turbomachinery designers are asked to develop more compact, efficient, and reliable machines. The research focuses on developing machines able to reduce energy losses and overall footprint, thus improving power plants efficiency and operability. To this end, expander-compressors (EC) seem to play a key role in the energy transition and appear a promising technology for high-density plants, especially together with hydrogen (H2) or supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as working fluid. However, when operating conditions changes, a reduction in machine efficiency may be expected, with a consequent degradation of the overall system performance. In order to optimize the operation of the power plant, it is crucial to understand how the variation of the expander-compressor behavior affects the working conditions of the other components of the plant. In this perspective, a fast and reliable way to estimate the EC performance at different operating conditions is necessary. Although the scientific literature shows several studies on mean-line approaches for expanders and centrifugal compressors, the joint use of 1D models with artificial neural networks (ANN) for ECs combined machine is still overlooked. To fill this gap, the prediction of artificial intelligence (AI)-based performance maps is proposed in this work. The tool has been tested in a case study based on a real EC. Results showed a rapid evaluation of EC efficiency while varying the operating conditions.

Abstract A sealed reciprocating tribometer has been used to study the influence of different gaseous environments on the friction and wear properties of AISI52100 bearing steel at atmospheric pressure and 25 °C. Helium, argon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen all give high friction and wear, suggestive of very little, if any tribofilm formation under the conditions studied. Dry air and oxygen also give high friction, slightly lower than the inert gases, but produce extremely high wear, much higher than the inert gases. This is characteristic of the phenomenon of “oxidational wear”. The two gases ammonia and carbon monoxide give relatively low friction and wear, and XPS analysis indicates that this is due to the formation of adsorbed ammonia/nitride and carbonate films respectively. For the hydrocarbon gases studied, two factors appear to control friction and wear, degree of unsaturation and molecular weight. For the saturated hydrocarbons, methane and ethane give high friction and wear but propane and butane give low friction after a period of rubbing that decreases with molecular weight. The unsaturated hydrocarbons all give an immediate reduction in friction with correspondingly low wear. Raman analysis shows that all the hydrocarbons that reduce friction and wear form a carbonaceous tribofilm on the rubbed surfaces. Graphical Abstract

Vegetation plays an important role in absorbing carbon dioxide and accelerating the achievement of carbon neutrality. As the ecological barrier of North China, the Taihang Mountains are pivotal to the ecological construction project of China. Nevertheless, the dynamic development of the vegetation carbon sink in the region and the impact factors on the sink have not been systematically evaluated. This study employed a comprehensive approach, utilising remote sensing technology and meteorological and topographic data, in conjunction with the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) estimation model to reveal the characteristics of vegetation carbon sinks in the Taihang Mountain, and then revealed the dynamics evolution of the NEP and the inter-annual trend by using Theil–Sen Median slope estimation, the Mann–Kendall test, and the coefficient of dissociation and analysed the driving roles of the influencing factors by using the parameter optimal geographic detector. Our findings suggest that the NEP in the Taihang Mountain area has a clear growth trend in time, the average value of NEP in the Taihang Mountain area is 289 gC-m−2-a−1 from 2000 to 2022, and the spatial distribution shows the characteristics of high in the northeast and low in the middle and west, with a gradual increase from the northeast to the southwest; the areas with high fluctuation of NEP are mainly distributed in the areas around some cities that are susceptible to the interference of natural or anthropogenic factors. The vegetation carbon sinks in the Taihang Mountains are influenced by a variety of natural factors, among which the explanatory power of each natural factor is as follows: DEM (0.174) > temperature (0.148) > precipitation (0.026) > slope (0.017) > slope direction (0.003). The natural factor DEM had the strongest explanatory power for NEP changes, and the two-by-two effects of the natural factors on vegetation carbon sinks were all significantly stronger than the effects of a single factor, in which the interaction between DEM and precipitation had the strongest explanatory power; distinguishing from climate change factors, the contribution of anthropogenic activities to NEP changes in more than 90% of the area of the Taihang Mountainous Region was more than 60%, and the driving force of anthropogenic factors on NEP changes in the Taihang Mountainous Region was significantly stronger than that of natural climate change. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to NEP changes in the Taihang Mountains was significantly stronger than that of natural climate change. The results of this study can not only provide a reference for carbon reduction and sink increase and ecological restoration projects in the Taihang Mountains but also benefit the research paradigm of vegetation carbon sequestration in other regions.

In this study, we explore a novel approach to nitrogen oxide (NOx) purification based on the principles of the chemical looping (CL) platform. This technique harnesses the reducing power of natural gas (CH4), instead of ammonia, to eliminate NOx in the flue gas, addressing environmental concerns such as ammonia slip in the state-of-the-art selective catalytic reduction process. The CL scheme involves utilizing nickel oxide (NiO) as the solid oxygen carrier to facilitate oxygen transfer from NOx to CH4 in two steps. In the first step (carrier oxidation), NOx in the flue gas reacts with reduced nickel (Ni), transferring its [O] to the carrier, thereby forming NiO. In the subsequent step (carrier reduction), CH4 reacts with the lattice oxygen of the oxidized carrier, generating a pure stream of CO2 and reducing NiO to Ni. We designed a high-performance carrier by dispersing NiO on an inert support to enhance the carrier's kinetics and thermal stability. We evaluated various support materials, and among them, alumina (Al2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2) demonstrated significantly superior reactivity. Notably, the Al2O3-supported carrier outperformed the ZrO2-supported carrier in NO purification and CH4 reduction and demonstrated stable performance over 10 redox cycles. Furthermore, fixed-bed experiments revealed 100% NO conversion during carrier oxidation, with optimal reaction kinetics achieved at lower space velocities, resulting in an overall high carrier utilization. Importantly, CO2 showcased no adverse effects during the NOx purification step. During the carrier reduction, complete combustion was favored, leading to CH4 conversion exceeding 95% and a CO2 selectivity of 90% at 400 °C. The CL NOx purification approach represents a promising strategy for mitigating NOx emissions.

Background: To test the ability of a low-pressure, low-flow, Heliox-based rebreathing system to reduce work of breathing and conserve gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels in a bench study. Methods: We performed a bench study of a novel low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber that was connected to an artificial lung simulator with careful monitoring of flow, pressure, work of breathing, oxygen (O2), carbon-dioxide (CO2), temperature, and humidity levels. Multiple runs of breathing were performed while manipulating levels of resistance (5 – 30 cm H2O/L/sec), gas mixtures (room air, 79% Helium 21% O2, and 70% Helium and 30% O2), and leak levels (ultra-low, low, and high). Results: We found significant reductions in work of breathing (up to 64%) while conserving gas with estimates of up to 54-fold reduction in medical gas wastage (P<0.001). Specifically, at resistances of 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm H2O/L/sec we demonstrated 64%, 57%, 36%, and 7% reduction in work of breathing (P<0.0001). Gas wastage was reduced by 10- to 54-fold while the end-tidal CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature were maintained by the device at physiological levels. Conclusions: In a bench-test, a low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber reduced work of breathing and conserved gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels. Future studies in human subjects need to be performed to determine whether reduction of work of breathing and gas conservation can be achieved.

This study introduces a novel hybrid solar–biomass cogeneration power plant that efficiently produces heat, electricity, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen using concentrated solar power and syngas from cotton stalk biomass. Detailed exergy-based thermodynamic, economic, and environmental analyses demonstrate that the optimized system achieves an exergy efficiency of 48.67% and an exergoeconomic factor of 80.65% and produces 51.5 MW of electricity, 23.3 MW of heat, and 8334.4 kg/h of hydrogen from 87,156.4 kg/h of biomass. The study explores four scenarios for green hydrogen production pathways, including chemical looping reforming and supercritical water gasification, highlighting significant improvements in levelized costs and the environmental impact compared with other solar-based hybrid systems. Systems 2 and 3 exhibit superior performance, with levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of 49.2 USD/MWh and 55.4 USD/MWh and levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOH) of between 10.7 and 19.5 USD/MWh. The exergoenvironmental impact factor ranges from 66.2% to 73.9%, with an environmental impact rate of 5.4–7.1 Pts/MWh. Despite high irreversibility challenges, the integration of solar energy significantly enhances the system’s exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental performance, making it a promising alternative as fossil fuel reserves decline. To improve competitiveness, addressing process efficiency and cost reduction in solar concentrators and receivers is crucial.

Abstract This work reports the production of polymeric nanocapsules of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/phase change materials (PCM), using continuous supercritical emulsion extraction (SEE‐C). Five fatty acids (FAs) were tested: capric (CA), lauric (LA), myristic (MA), palmitic (PA), and stearic (SA) acid, using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO 2 ) operating at 80 bar and 38°C in a tower apparatus. The two fatty acids with lower molecular weight (CA and LA) were extracted by the supercritical solvent and capsules were not obtained. The other three FAs formed spherical, non‐coalescing nanocapsules characterized by mean diameters ranging between 134 and 252 nm, as shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, with a sharp particles size distribution and encapsulation efficiencies up to 99.8%. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) analyses confirmed the successful encapsulation, allowing the measurement of the energy storage properties of produced capsules. Stability analysis performed over 5 months showed that the nanocapsules were stable in this time interval. Thermal cycles experiments confirmed the thermal stability of the capsules. The best performance was obtained for PA based nanocapsules, which showed a stability reduction of only 0.43% after 25 thermal cycles.

A promising method for converting greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 into useful syngas is the dry reformation of methane (DRM). 5Ni-ZSM-5 and 2 wt.% Ce, Cs, Sr, Fe, and Cu-promoted 5Ni-ZSM-5 catalysts are investigated for the DRM at 700 °C under atmospheric pressure. The characterization, including XRD, TPR, TPD, TPO, N2 adsorption–desorption, TGA, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, revealed that the catalyst’s active sites are distributed throughout the pore channels and on the surface, contributing to the stability of the catalyst. Specifically, the CO2-TPO followed by the O2-TPO experiment using spent catalysts confirmed the oxidizing capacity of CO2 during the DRM reaction. The Ce-promoted catalyst showed the greatest increase in catalytic activity among other catalysts. The 5Ni+2Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited twice the concentration of acid sites compared to the Cs-promoted counterpart, even though both catalysts achieved similar quantities of active and basic sites. Without compromising H2 and CO selectivity, this finding underscores the crucial role of acid sites in enhancing CH4 and CO2 conversion. With a GHSV of 42,000 mL/(h.gcat), the 5Ni+2Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated impressive CH4 conversion rates of 42% at 700 °C and 70% at 800 °C. The reactants spend more time over catalysts during the subsequent reduction of GHSV to 21,000 mL/(h.gcat), resulting in the best catalytic performance with 80% CH4 and 83% CO2 conversions.

Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.

Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic-biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR-1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar-to-chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral-assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non-photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient-lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.

Abstract Within the energy sector, the mitigation of climate change necessitates a paradigm change towards the replacement of conventional with sustainable power generation technologies. Due to the inherent volatility of renewable power generation technologies, dispatchable components, such as gas turbines (GT) will have to be used increasingly for residual load balancing. In addition, GTs are expected to operate fewer hours per year, more flexibly, and at lower capacities. However, fuel utilization in GT is inherently linked to emissions. As a potentially CO2-free energy carrier, hydrogen is a promising fuel for GTs and manufacturers are working on suitable combustor technologies. However, the availability of large quantities of CO2-free H2 remains unclear in the near future. Other pollutants such as NOx and emissions due to incomplete combustion are formed differently in part-load. Therefore, optimizing natural gas substitution based on available H2 quantities and load profiles can improve the overall emission footprint beyond just reducing CO2 emissions. In this study, a physical-based gas turbine performance model and an emission calculation tool are used to derive an optimized H2 admixture strategy for different load profiles. Characteristic load demand scenarios are derived from actual load profiles of gas power plants and the emission footprints are comprehensively evaluated by different environmental impact categories. In general, the emission footprint is increased significantly and moderately for capacity reduction and flexibility increase of GT operation. The availability of H2 in the near future is derived from forecasts for Germany, and the corresponding quantities are allocated to the partial loads according to the optimized strategy. In most scenarios, the addition of H2 is associated with a reduction in emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel operation. The greatest leverage of H2 admixture in reducing the environmental footprint is found when applied from the lowest load up, thus assisting in the start-up and shut-down process.

This study examines the effects of renewable energy consumption and environmental taxes on CO2 emissions in OECD countries from 1990 to 2022, employing the cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) approach. The findings reveal that both renewable energy consumption and environmental taxes significantly reduce CO2 emissions in both the short and the long term, emphasizing their crucial roles in climate change mitigation and sustainability promotion. Furthermore, this study identifies that industrialization and urbanization contribute to increased emissions, whereas foreign direct investment aids in emission reduction through the facilitation of green technology transfer. Economic growth is initially associated with higher emissions, but this trend reverses as economies mature and adopt sustainable practices. These results highlight the importance of continuous investment in renewable energy infrastructure and the implementation of robust environmental tax policies to achieve long-term sustainability goals. The integration of environmental considerations into economic and urban planning, along with leveraging foreign direct investment for technological advancements, is imperative for balancing economic growth with the necessity to reduce carbon emissions and effectively address climate change. This research provides a better understanding of the diverse factors influencing CO2 emissions and offers critical insights for policymakers.

The air quality in educational campuses affects the health and work efficiency of teachers and students. Studies into this matter are of great significance for optimizing the management of campus living environments. Low-cost online sensors to monitor PM2.5 and CO2 levels were used in typical functional areas of a university campus in Beijing, China, including offices, dormitories, leisure spaces, canteens, and laboratories. By comparing the findings with data from nearby national monitoring stations, the seasonal and spatial variations in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations were analyzed. Findings indicate PM2.5 levels within the campus were notably lower compared to the surrounding urban environment. There was variation in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations across different functional areas. Typically, indoor PM2.5 levels were lower than outdoor ones, while CO2 concentrations in enclosed indoor spaces with human activities progressively escalated. The main internal emission sources affecting the PM2.5 level on campus included traffic emissions, dust generated by human activities, and emissions from catering. In contrast, in areas with better green coverage or where a lake system participates in the atmospheric circulation, the PM2.5 level and CO2/PM2.5 were lower. This indicates that the cleansing impact of plants and aquatic systems is instrumental in lowering PM2.5 concentrations, offering healthier leisure spaces. Seasonal variations also impact PM2.5 levels. During the non-heating period, less pollution source emissions led to decreased outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. The campus monitoring sites experienced an approximate 5 µg/m3 and 29 µg/m3 reduction in the average PM2.5 levels as compared to the PM2.5 of the surrounding urban environment, respectively, during the non-heating and heating period. During indoor activities or sleep, CO2 levels can build up to as high as 2303 ppm due to breathing. It is advisable to stay indoors on days when pollution levels are high, whereas on days with clean air, it is healthier to be outdoors or to air out indoor areas by opening windows. Our research provides clearer scientific evidence for incorporating behavioral strategies for improving air quality into both daily work and life. Moreover, the findings are quite meaningful for the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor monitoring in various environments, with applications beyond just the campus settings.    

    

## CO2-Based Power Cycles: What Effect Does Additive Molecular Complexity Have on the Cycle Layout?

Abstract Since their inception, CO2 power cycles have gained prominence for their superior performance and compactness. However, the efficiency of the simple supercritical CO2 cycle is hindered by relatively large temperature differences in the recuperator, leading to increased exergy destruction. Although complex cycles like the recompression or precompression cycles can reduce recuperator irreversibility, their higher complexity and additional equipment requirements raise the cost of the power plant. This paper aims to demonstrate that recuperator irreversibility in a simple recuperated transcritical cycle can be alleviated using CO2-based mixtures, without resorting to complex cycles. This is achieved by comparing the efficiencies of simple and recompression cycles using CO2-based mixtures with nine additives of various molecular complexities: H2S, SO2, C3H8, C4H10, C5H12, C6H6, C4H4S, TiCl4, and C6F6. The effect of additive molar fraction (ranging from 0.05 to 0.5) on the efficiency of both cycles is examined. Thermal efficiency optimisation reveals a correlation between the efficiency difference of the simple and recompression cycles and the molecular complexity of the working fluid. The reduction in recuperator irreversibility is attributed to the decrease in the difference in the isobaric specific heat capacities between the streams in the recuperator with the use of complex additives. Consequently, the advantage of a recompression cycle diminishes as the aggregate molecular complexity of the working fluid increases. Simple additives like H2S, SO2, and C3H8 result in recompression cycles outperforming simple recuperated cycles by 4% to 8% in terms of absolute thermal efficiency, depending on the additive and its molar fraction. Conversely, more complex additives like C4H4S, TiCl4, and C6F6, exhibit thermal efficiencies in simple recuperated cycles comparable to those of recompression cycles. The additive molar fraction at which both cycles achieve similar performances depends on the molecular complexity of the additive; the more complex the additive, the lower the additive molar fraction required to create a complex working fluid. Moreover, the split fraction in recompression cycles exhibits a similar correlation with molecular complexity as observed in the efficiency difference, suggesting that recompression cycles will morph into simple recuperated cycles as molecular complexity increases. In conclusion, the use of additives provides an additional dimension through which the efficiency of CO2 cycles can be optimised, enabling improved performance without the need for complex cycles.

In the field of economic analysis, the study of the EU ETS policy has primarily focused on the impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth, as well as the role of legal and fiscal instruments in the development of clean energy. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the EU ETS policy in altering the energy mix of selected European countries, providing both cognitive and applicational value. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this policy focused on the structure of the energy mix and the relationship between rising CO2 emission allowance prices and the decreasing share of coal in the energy mix. The goal was achieved through statistical analysis of secondary sources, primarily sourced from Bloomberg (2016–2024). The research findings indicated that changes in the structure of energy sources varied across the studied European countries, due to the adopted energy source utilization strategy, resource availability, and geopolitical situations. Additionally, different correlation values were noted between rising CO2 emission allowance prices and the expected reduction in fossil fuel use. Therefore, the EU ETS policy does not fulfill its assigned role—its implementation contributes to disparities in the economic situations of European economies and creates conditions for unequal competition.

To date, the use of ferrous hydrogen in metallurgy is considered from several positions. First, the partial or complete replacement of carbon with hydrogen reduces greenhouse gas emissions of CO2. Secondly, due to the different chemical affinity for oxygen, it becomes possible to selectively (selectively) extract components from complex complex ores and man-made materials. Thirdly, the absence of carbon in the reaction zone will make it possible to obtain a metal with a low content of carbides, which in many cases increases the demand for the product. Thermodynamic calculations of a multicomponent oxide system (Ni, Fe, P, Zn, Mn, V, Cr, O) in the presence of various reducing agents: carbon, hydrogen are performed using the TERRA software package, and their combined effects are considered. It is shown that the type of reducing agent affects the temperature of the beginning of the reduction of metals and the degree of their metallization. Thus, by selecting the type of reducing agent, its quantity, and the temperature of the process, it is possible to selectively extract some metals, and leave others in an oxidized state. Ilmenite concentrate in the form of a briquette was used in laboratory tests. The analysis of the iron reduction process using carbon or hydrogen as a reducing agent has been carried out. In comparison with the results obtained using carbon, the kinetics of iron reduction with hydrogen is higher. At the same time, the reduction proceeds with the formation of metallic iron, rutile (TiO2) and residual ilmenite. Whereas, in a carbothermic process occurring at higher temperatures (1000–1300 ℃), the reduction products are iron and iron ditanate (FeTi2O5). In addition, an important advantage of selective reduction by gas is the possibility of subsequent separation of the metallic and oxide phases by melting, without fear of secondary reduction due to solid carbon residues.

The steel industry accounts, according to the International Energy Agency, for ~6.7% of global CO2 emissions, and the major portion of its contribution is from steelmaking via the blast furnace (BF) route. In the short term, a significant reduction in fossil CO2 emissions can be achieved through the introduction of bio-coal into the BF as part of cold bonded briquettes, by injection, or as part of coke. The use of bio-coal-containing residue briquettes was previously demonstrated in industrial trials in Sweden, whereas bio-coal injection was only tested on a pilot scale or in one-tuyere tests. Therefore, industrial trials replacing part of the pulverized coal (PC) were conducted. It was concluded that the grinding, conveying, and injection of up to 10% of charcoal (CC) with PC can be safely achieved without negative impacts on PC injection plant or BF operational conditions and without losses of CC with the dust. From a process point of view, higher addition is possible, but it must be verified that grinding and conveying is feasible. Through an experimentally validated computational fluid flow model, it was shown that a high moisture content and the presence of oversized particles delay devolatilization and ignition, lowering the combustion efficiency. By using CC with similar heating value to PC, compositional variations in the injected blend are not critical.

Abstract Gas Turbines will need to reduce CO2 emissions and prove their flexibility based on market needs and new proposed rules [2]. Economically, utilizing existing gas turbine assets to meet these requirements will be of great benefit as compared to building new turbines. Even better, determining the lowest cost least intrusive upgrades required is of great interest to power producers. The demonstration described here was conducted on one (1) GT unit at the Constellation Hillabee power plant (Siemens Energy SGT6-6000G 2x1 configuration) which doubled the mass flow of hydrogen of previous record-breaking DLN demonstrations. The testing was done on an unaltered, existing GT asset, which provides great value for those GTs which are already providing power using natural gas. The demonstrated hydrogen blending percentage of 38.8% (resulting in approximately 18% reduction in CO2 emissions) proved the system capable of meeting the first BSER goals set forth in recent proposed US EPA gas turbine rules. Such demonstrations are of critical importance as they show the inherent capability to meet reduced carbon power generation requirements without more significant cost outlays. This report documents the evaluation, preparation, execution, and results from this demonstration testing. The results are provided for the gas turbine community to use as insight into the capability and flexibility of existing assets to meet the future demands of reduced carbon power generation. Specific information around safety, reliability, emissions, and operability are discussed to provide context around existing asset capability.

Lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) is gaining interest due to its reduced weight, high strength, and durability while being cost-effective. This research proposes a method to design an LWAC by integrating coconut shell (CS) as coarse lightweight aggregate and a high volume of wet-grinded ultrafine ground granulated blast furnace slag (UGGBS). To optimize the mix design of LWAC, a particle packing model was employed. A comparative analysis was conducted between normal-weight concrete (M40) and the optimized LWAC reinforced with basalt fibers (BF). The parameters analyzed include CO2 emissions, density, surface crack conditions, water absorption and porosity, sorptivity, and compressive and flexural strength. The optimal design was determined using the packing density method. Also, the impact of BF was investigated at varying levels (0%, 0.15%, and 1%). The results revealed that the incorporation of UGGBS had a substantial enhancement to the mechanical properties of LWAC when BF and CS were incorporated. As a significant finding of this research, a grade 30 LWAC with demolded density of 1864 kg/m3 containing only 284 kg/m3 cement was developed. The LWAC with high-volume UGGBS and BF had the minimum CO2 emissions at 390.9 kg/t, marking a reduction of about 31.6% compared to conventional M40-grade concrete. This research presents an introductory approach to sustainable, environmentally friendly, high-strength, and low-density concrete production by using packing density optimization, thereby contributing to both environmental conservation and structural outcomes.

Abstract The industrial sector is a key global source of wealth, but it is also recognized as a major challenge toward worldwide decarbonization. Today the industrial sector requires more than 22 % of the global energy demand as thermal energy and produces for this about 40 % of the total CO2 emissions. Solutions to efficiently decarbonize the industrial sector are deemed. This work presents a comparative techno-economic performance assessment of a high temperature heat pump integration within a molten salts based power to heat system for industrial heat flexible generation. The main system performance is reported in terms of required working conditions and temperature for the heat pump and thermal demand size as well as reduction of the attainable levelized cost of heat (LCoH) against non-flexible electric boiler based systems. The impact of different industrial load profiles, electricity prices, heat pump capital cost and heat pump real to Carnot efficiency ratio are also presented. The results highlight that the proposed system can be cost-competitive, particularly for thermal demand around 10 MW and waste heat temperatures above 80°C. Under these conditions LCoH reduction higher than 15 %, with respect to the considered non-flexible electric boiler alternative, are attainable. These LCoH reductions are primarily driven by savings in electrical consumption as high as 30 %. This study sets the ground for further power-to-heat techno-economic investigations addressing different industrial sectors and identifies main system and components design strategies, integrations, and targets.

Abstract It is recognized that Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) will play a significant role in the decarbonization of air mobility and various pathways and feedstocks are considered for their production. This may lead to differences in chemical and physical properties when compared to conventional, fossil, aviation fuel (CAF). SAF available today are blended with CAF and after blending they are compliant with the Jet Fuel norm (ASTM1655). But the goal of achieving 100% SAF could be problematic, as the absence of aromatics, one of the characteristics of SAF produced today, could lead to leaks in the seal. Adding renewable aromatics (Synthesized Aromatic Kerosene, or SAK) to the SAF is therefore seen as an opportunity to reach 100% SAF without impacting the aircraft and airport’s fuel infrastructures, potentially enabling a faster decarbonization of the sector. In this study, we have compared the emissions of a 100% SAF which contains 9% of SAK issued from the biomass (SAF-SPK/A) with a CAF. Performance and behavior: The tests did not identify any performance differences between the two fuels, including turbine reactivity and equipment degradation. This was later confirmed by Bell Helicopter during an experimental test flight campaign. Emissions: the lower CO2 impact is mainly due to the life cycle analysis of the SAF, but the test also showed reduced CO2 emissions during the combustion. While NO and NOx were found equivalent, significant reduction in CO and soot (Smoke Number, SN) were measured: −20 to −50% depending on the mass fuel flow. These improvements could be explained by the lower content of aromatics as well as the nature of these aromatics and this will be further investigated in future studies.

The first isolation and characterization of transition metal complexes with the parent Al(I)–H unit were achieved in base-stabilized forms. W and Fe complexes, Cp*(CO)n(H)M←:AlH(NHC)2 (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene, n = 1 or 2), were synthesized in 43–63% yields by the one-step reaction of Cp*M(CO)n(py)Me with H3Al·NHC. The characterization included 1H and 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and infrared (IR) spectroscopic analysis, as well as DFT calculations, which revealed the extremely strong σ-donating ability of the :AlH(NHC)2 ligand, and the highly polarized M(δ−)←:Al(δ+) coordination bonds. The monovalent oxidation state of the Al center of these complexes was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hydroalumination of carbodiimide and the reduction of CO2 to CO were also demonstrated.

Cannabigerol’s (CBG) therapeutic effects are limited by its poor water solubility and low dissolution rate. To improve these properties, supercritical CO2-assisted atomization (SAA) was applied to produce coprecipitates, i.e., CBG nanoparticles coprecipitated in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) microparticles. The experiments were performed by varying the CBG/PVP mass ratio (R) and the overall concentration of solutes CBG+PVP to study the influence of these parameters on particle morphology, particle size, and size distribution. Periodic dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was performed at regular time intervals to measure the size of CBG nanoparticles in PVP microparticles. It showed that CBG nanoparticles down to 105 nm were successfully produced through SAA. Dissolution tests were used to verify that a reduction of CBG particle size significantly increased its dissolution rate. In the liquid medium adopted, untreated CBG powder was released in 210 min, whereas CBG nanoparticles of 105 nm were completely dissolved in only 15 min.

Abstract The increasing commitment to sustainable practices has intensified research into innovative methods to diminish the release of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases, such as CO2, CO, and NOx, into our environment. A promising avenue of exploration lies in the adoption of fuel emulsions enriched with nano-additives aimed at curtailing NOx emissions. In this context, our study delves into the impact of nano-particulate additives — specifically those based on ammonia and water — on the combustion characteristics of Jet-A1 aviation fuel. Utilizing a 300-kW liquid swirl combustor, we conducted a series of experiments across two global equivalence ratios (Φ = 0.24 and Φ = 0.40). Our investigation encompassed the analysis of laminar flame speed (LFS) and an in-depth examination of flame properties through advanced chemiluminescence imaging and modal analysis techniques. The primary objective was to unravel the complexities of how these nano-additives modulate flame dynamics and the intricate web of internal chemical reactions, alongside evaluating the broader environmental ramifications resulting from alterations in the combustion process. The experimental outcomes revealed that the integration of urea and water additives into the fuel matrix distinctly affected LFS, with observed enhancements at the lower global equivalence ratio and detrimental impacts when the ratio was increased. Through modal analysis, we discerned a notable stabilizing influence on the flame’s behavior, which was particularly pronounced at leaner fuel conditions. From the study of the spray, the addition of water and urea appears to influence combustion chemistry, and more uniform sprays facilitate more complete combustion. Chemiluminescence imaging further illuminated these effects, demonstrating a higher emission intensity of NH2* radicals compared to NH* radicals, a variance contingent on the global equivalence ratio. Notably, the experimental data indicated a substantial abatement in NOx emissions, predominantly at the lower equivalence ratios. This reduction was accompanied by a marginal uptick in CO2 and CO emissions — a trade-off that warrants consideration.

Abstract. This manuscript presents the results of a cradle-to-gate lifecycle assessment (LCA) conducted on a component manufactured through two distinct process routes: Hot stamping of AA6082-T6 and cold stamping of AA5251-H22. The primary objective of this study is to provide a detailed understanding of the environmental impact associated with these processes and to conduct a comparative analysis of their environmental profiles. A comprehensive process map was developed for each manufacturing route, delineating all inputs and outputs at each step. Forming trials were executed during the LCA, capturing equipment energy consumption. When immediate data was unavailable from trials, the LCA model was supplemented with information from the Ecoinvent 3.6 database. The analysis demonstrates that the adoption of advanced near-net-shape manufacturing, specifically hot stamping, can significantly diminish the environmental impact compared to traditional cold stamping processes. Despite the additional energy requirements for heating in hot stamping, the overall environmental savings, supported by uncertainty analysis, are considerable. In the case of the examined demonstrator part, hot stamping showcased a noteworthy 35% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions, equivalent to 6 kg CO2e per part. This reduction is primarily attributed to two key factors: the decreased material thickness achievable in hot stamping while preserving equivalent mechanical characteristics in the final part and the recycling of any material waste after forming. The results underscore the environmental advantages of embracing advanced manufacturing techniques, contributing valuable insights for environmentally conscious decision-making in the manufacturing industry.

This research discusses administrative challenges and market strategies in implementing a carbon tax in Indonesia. The carbon tax was introduced through the 2021 Harmonization of Tax Regulations Law to control CO2 emissions from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Key challenges include administrative complexity, strong inter-agency coordination, effective monitoring systems, and consistent law enforcement. The global carbon market in 2023 shows great potential for economically efficient emissions reductions, but implementing this model requires adapting to Indonesia's socio-economic landscape. The research method used is a qualitative approach with case studies, combining data from policy documents, interviews with tax experts, and local carbon market analysis. The research results show that the implementation of a carbon tax is faced with several major challenges, including a lack of accurate data on emissions, an immature monitoring system, and resistance from certain industrial sectors. Effective market management strategies, such as the allocation of tax revenues to sustainable projects, are key to mitigating negative economic impacts and encouraging investment in green technologies. This research makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the complexity of carbon tax implementation in developing countries and its relevance in the global context for achieving climate change goals.

Metal formyl and hydroxymethyl complexes are implicated as key intermediates in the (photo)electrochemical reduction of carbon oxides (CO2 or CO) to liquid fuels, such as methanol. Formyl complexes, and to a lesser extent hydroxymethyl complexes, have been previously synthesized and characterized; nevertheless, the influence of electronic modifications to ligands supporting these reactive carbon fragments is not well understood. Herein, we report the synthesis of a family of ruthenium polypyridyl carbonyl complexes of the form [Ru(4,4′-R,R-bpy)(tpy)(CO)]2+ bearing different substituents on the bipyridyl (bpy) ligand (R = OMe, H, CF3). Treatment with NaBH4 as a chemical reductant results in the formation of the formyl and subsequently the hydroxymethyl and methyl complexes; each is characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and isotopic labeling studies. An electron-donating modification (R = OMe) to the bpy ligand is shown to significantly increase the lifetime of the formyl intermediate and the yield of released methanol. We observe a clear linear dependence of thermodynamic parameters on bpy electronics; however, the stability of the formyl complex and the reactivity of the resulting hydroxymethyl complex do not depend linearly on ligand electronics. We anticipate that these results may be extended to future development of (photo)electrocatalytic systems for CO-to-methanol conversion.

Mechanical air conditioning systems have a significant share of energy consumption in the building sector. Passive solar systems, such as solar chimneys, can reduce building energy demand by supplying space heating, cooling, and ventilation, significantly decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the heating and ventilation efficiencies of a solar chimney integrated system, including a roof solar chimney coupled with an air channel, for a two-story office building in Tehran, Iran. The studied system's conditions are switchable from heating to cooling by changing the opening positions. Computational Fluid Dynamics was employed to numerically investigate the heating and ventilation efficiencies of the proposed solar system. The results confirmed that the system could be utilized for pre-heating purposes during working hours but that the building should be ventilated only for 35% of this time with an air change rate of 0.8 during the year's coldest month. The arrangement could provide thermal and ventilation comfort for the occupied space only at solar intensity and ambient temperature higher than 550 W/m2 and 10 °C, respectively. In addition, the solar system could reduce 32% of the annual heating demand (918 kWh), which is equal to a reduction of 1865 kg of CO2 emissions during working hours.

Solar energy is the most promising source for generating residential, commercial, and industrial electricity. However, solar panels should be eco-friendly to increase sustainability during manufacturing and recycling. This study investigates the potential of using natural fibre composites as eco-friendly alternatives to conventional polyethylene terephthalate (PET) back sheets in solar panels. Furthermore, it examines the performance of sisal fibres coated with zeolite-polyester resin. The chemical composition, structural integrity, and crystalline properties of the composites were evaluated through extensive microstructural analysis. The results from the experimental analysis revealed significant improvements in voltage (8%) and current (6%) for the coated sisal fibre panels compared to conventional panels. Power output increased by 12%, and overall efficiency improved from 9.75 to 10.8%. Solar panels with sisal fibre sheets exhibit adequate tensile strength and impact resistance and reduce operating temperature by 2–3 °C, ensuring stable operation and minimizing heat loss. Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability and significance of these results. The life cycle analysis demonstrated a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions and a 50% decrease in energy consumption during the production, utilization and disposal of sisal fibre sheets. These findings underscore the viability of natural fibre composites in enhancing the performance and sustainability of solar panels.

Concrete is the most widely used construction material in civil engineering industry because of its proved structural strength and stability when made properly. The concrete industry is constantly trying to evolve to make concrete more sustainable replacing a part of full cement with additives and Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs). Each tonne of cement production releases one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere and hence to greenhouse effect and global warming. A cost effective, alternative and innovative materials called novel additive is taken up for present study to reduce the cement consumption per m3 of concrete/SCC without reduction in strength of required grade. In this project an effort is made replacing cement content of SCC partially with Fly Ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) in combination of novel additive. The study focused at studying the properties of fresh SCC and hardened SCC. The design mix proportion of 1: 2.63: 1.86 with a W/B ratio of 0.36 is taken up and 4 different mixes with different combinations of varied percentage replacement materials with 2% by weight of cement of novel additive. The properties of green SCC showed that fresh properties get enhanced through usage of mineral admixtures including a novel additive and hence, the addition of mineral admixture improve the flowability or rheology of SCC mixes. The strength of SCC achieved is ranging from 32- 46 N/mm2 for a cementitious content of 400 kg/m3 , highest being with lowest cement content with novel additive.

This study establishes a life cycle assessment model to quantitively evaluate and predict material resource consumption, fossil energy consumption and environmental emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) by employing the GaBi software. This study distinguishes the environmental impact of different vehicle working conditions, power battery degradation scenarios, and mileage scenarios on the operation and use stages of PHEVs, BEVs, and HEVs. The findings indicate that under urban, highway, and aggressive driving conditions, PHEVs’ life cycle material resource and fossil fuel consumption exceed that of BEVs but are less than HEVs. Battery degradation leads to increased material resource consumption, energy use, and environmental emissions for both PHEVs and BEVs. When the power battery degrades to 85%, the material resource and fossil energy consumption during the operation and use phase increases by 51.43%, 72.68% for BEVs and 29.37%, 36.21% for PHEVs compared with no degradation, respectively, indicating that the environmental impact of BEVs are more sensitive than those of PHEVs to the impact of power battery degradation. Among different mileage scenarios, PHEVs demonstrate the lowest sensitivity to increased mileage regarding life cycle material resource consumption, with the smallest increase. Future projections for 2025 and 2035 suggest life cycle GWP of HEV, PHEV and BEV in 2035 is 1.21 × 104, 1.12 × 104 and 1.01 × 104 kg CO2-eq, respectively, which shows reductions of 48.7%, 30.9% and 36.1% compared with those in 2025. The outcomes of this study are intended to bolster data support for the manufacturing and development of PHEV, BEV and HEV under different scenarios and offer insights into the growth and technological progression of the automotive sector.

Abstract The estimation of a flame transfer function (FTF)from time series data generated by large eddy simulation (LES) via system identification (SI) is an established and important element of thermoacoustic analysis. To achieve results with low uncertainties, continuous (non-truncated) time series of adequate length are required. This can be a challenge in the case of turbulent flames, where signal-to-noise ratio may be low. Because LES codes do not scale to an arbitrarily high degree of parallelism, the wall-clock-time required for confident FTF estimation may be excessive. The present paper tackles this challenge by exploiting characteristic features of linear time-invariant systems. Specifically, we explore how the superposition of multiple simulations with the same excitation signal, but varying initial conditions, increases signal-to-noise ratio and leads to more robust identification, i.e. estimates with narrow confidence intervals. In addition, the established SI approach, which relies on broadband excitation, is compared to excitation with approximate Dirac and Heaviside signals, with the advantage of simpler pre- and post-processing. Results demonstrate that the proposed workflow, which is inherently parallel because it is based on superposition, reduces significantly the wall-clock-time required for robust FTF identification in the case of broadband excitation. This reduction in wall-clock-time requires more simultaneous simulation runs, i.e. more parallel computational resources, but it does not significantly increase the overall computational cost. Furthermore, the new workflow facilitates FTF estimation when exciting with a Heaviside signal. The proposed method is assessed for the case of a partially premixed, steam enriched (“WET”) swirl burner with significant turbulent noise levels. Steam enrichment is a combustion concept that reduces harmful emissions such as NOx and CO2 while increasing engine efficiency. However, the effect of steam on the flame response, i.e. the FTF, needs to be better understood. To this end, a combustion model that includes an optimized global chemical mechanism for partially premixed wet methane combustion, has been formulated and validated against experimental data.

(4) Interest is particularly growing in the Asia-Pacific area with its expanding population, urbanization, and rising disposable incomes which in turn drives the need for innovative green and sustainable chemical technologies that biocatalysis can provide [https://www.unescap.org/projects/gd]. This strong interest in new green technologies has caused a dramatic increase in fundamental research in biocatalysis, with large numbers of research groups from different disciplines entering the field. The breadth of research in biocatalysis in the Asia-Pacific area is showcased in this Virtual Special Issue, titled Biocatalysis in Asia and Pacific, which includes a snapshot of a collection of articles published in JACS Au in 2023/2024.Despite many successes in the general application of biocatalysis in industry, there remain many fundamental scientific challenges, some of which are addressed in this selection of papers. One particular challenge concerns the need for expensive cofactors such as nicotinamides which are for example needed for reduction and oxidation reactions. A perspective describes the very elegant solution of "biocatalytic hydrogen borrowing", which uses multistep sequences including dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in one pot by hydride shuffling between NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00026]. Another common challenge is active protein expression, and in a novel approach, unspecific peroxygenases have been successfully expressed using a superfolder-green-fluorescent protein in bacteria [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00129]. For multistep biocatalytic processes, cellular engineering guided by proteomic analysis can dramatically increase product titers, as shown for the production of α-bisabolene in yeast [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00106].An area of great interest is the design of reactions and reaction sequences beyond those found in nature. Some successful approaches shown here explore substrate promiscuity for challenging CO2 fixation reactions [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00290] or atroposelective synthesis of aldehydes [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00814]. Alternatively, biocatalysis can be combined with chemical reactions in chemo-enzymatic strategies, including for example Au catalysis [DOIs: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00222, 10.1021/jacsau.3c00688]. Such biocatalytic processes are not only applicable to the synthesis of target molecules but also in bioremediation strategies as demonstrated by removal of the toxic metabolite deoxynivalenol in plants [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00696] and engineering of a metal reductase for the bioremediation of anthropogenic electronic wastes [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00297].In addition to small molecule substrates, biocatalysis is also very attractive for larger biomolecules, such as complex glycoproteins that make up a significant number of the leading biopharmaceutical products. Glycoengineering using biocatalysis provides a tool for improving the therapeutic profile of antibodies, and using a structure-based design approach, an endoglycosidase was engineered to provide a novel toolbox for conjugating glycans to specific glycoprotein sites [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00004]. Glycoengineering often requires sugar nucleotide cofactor regeneration systems, and one such example for UDP-Xylose has been designed as bifunctional chimeras to minimize the need for additional proteins and improved activity [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00288].Computational tools are making a great impact in biocatalysis, in particular in protein engineering, and it is interesting that several papers in this Virtual Special Issue make use of machine learning and modeling tools to find new and better activities: directed evolution and machine learning are used in combination to enhance the diastereoselectivity of a ketoreductase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00284]. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations have been used to redesign a P450 monooxygenase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00075]. Computational enzyme redesign has been used to find mutants of a lyase with enhanced tolerance to denaturants for peptide C-terminal amidation [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00792]. Finally, density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamic simulations were used to identify and reduce energy barriers of key transition states to enhance C–N cleavage efficiency of an amino acid oxidase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00672].It is striking how even a small collection of papers in biocatalysis from Asia and the Pacific showcases the engagement of a very diverse group of scientists in areas ranging from computational to synthetic chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry, and synthetic biology to applications in engineering, cell biology, and medicine. Similarly diverse are the challenges addressed beyond the synthesis of bioactive compounds, driven by demands to solve societal problems in medicine with a more green and sustainable production of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical entities. There are also contributions from biocatalysis in directly solving environmental issues such as detoxification, removal of waste from the environment, and CO2 fixation. This Virtual Special Issue clearly shows that the topic of biocatalysis is very actively pursued at the highest international level using leading experimental and computational tools. Biocatalysis is very important to Asia and the Pacific, and the community is well placed to solve many of the challenges that lie ahead.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsSabine L.

These materials encompass various categories and types, including graphene, (1) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), (2) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), (3) MXenes, (4) graphdiyne, (5) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), (6) and monolayer molecular crystals. (7) These materials can exhibit diverse properties as metals, semiconductors, superconductors, insulators, dielectrics, and magnets. Their unique electronic, optical, mechanical, and quantum properties make them suitable for a wide range of applications, from transistors and sensors to quantum information sciences and energy storage. With their highly tunable and versatile physical properties, these atomically thin materials could promise technological opportunities beyond the reach of existing materials.With a thickness measured by a single atom or a few atoms and lateral dimensions extending up to the meter scale, 2D materials feature an extreme aspect ratio of up to 109 or larger. This extreme aspect ratio necessitates highly anisotropic growth, with growth rates differing by millions or billions of times across different dimensions, posing a fundamentally new synthetic challenge. Achieving consistent single-atom thickness while expanding laterally to macroscopic scale requires fine-tuned control over the nucleation and growth process. Precision chemistry holds the key to the production of uniform 2D materials, (8) their heterostructures, (9) and superlattices, (10,11) which are central for consistent electronic and optical properties. Understanding the fundamental growth mechanisms is essential for the controlled synthesis of 2D materials with specific stacking orders, symmetry, and phase characteristics, fundamentally determining their properties. (12) By precisely controlling doping levels, edge termination, heterostructure formation, and intercalation of functional species, researchers can further tailor the electronic and chemical properties of 2D materials, enhancing their functionality for various applications. (13) Given the extreme surface-to-volume ratio of 2D materials, precision surface chemistry is also critical for manipulating and optimizing relevant physical properties, including surface functionalization, surface protection, charge density, and other exotic properties such chiral optical and spintronic properties. Proper surface modification may also enhance the stability and performance of 2D materials in various applications.Precision chemistry plays a central role in tailoring the atomic and molecular structures of 2D materials, thereby unlocking their full potential in various high-impact areas such as lower-power electronics, energy storage, catalysis, and sensing. Precise control over dimensions, chemical compositions, impurity doping, heterostructure interface, or surface modification makes it possible to finely tune the electronic properties of 2D materials, including bandgap engineering, carrier density, and mobility regulation, which are crucial for applications in transistors, sensors, and other electronic devices. 2D materials exhibit unique optical properties, such as layer-number tunable photoluminescence and strong light–matter interactions. (14,15) Precision control over their synthesis allows for the optimization of these properties for use in optoelectronic devices and photodetectors. At the atomic scale, quantum effects become significant. Precision chemistry allows for the control over quantum properties such as spin, (16) valley polarization, (17) charge correlation, (18) and single photon emission, (19) which are important for emerging quantum technologies. (20) Additionally, 2D materials are also promising candidates for energy conversion and storage applications due to their high surface area and unique electrochemical properties. A precise control of their synthesis, surface modification, heteroatom doping, and assembly in higher-order superstructures is critical for capturing the merits of 2D materials in supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, or green hydrogen production. (21−24)This Special Issue (including Part I and Part II) in Precision Chemistry titled "Precision Chemistry for Two-Dimensional Materials" features the latest research and perspectives from the leading scientists in this rapidly developing field, highlighting the development and application of precision chemistry for scalable synthesis of 2D materials, including large-area thin films, single crystals, heterostructures, and superlattices of various 2D materials, as well as rational tailoring of their chemical and physical properties for various applications in unconventional electronics, sensing, catalysis, energy storage, and molecular nanofiltration.The liquid-phase exfoliation technique offers a top-down strategy for scalable processing of 2D-TMDs in large quantities.
