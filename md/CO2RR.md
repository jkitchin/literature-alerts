Carbon dioxide, a "greenhouse gas" resulted from industrial fossil fuels combustion, is a major driver of global warming and climate change. Several works have been pursued to reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The most attractive and feasible approach to address this issue and maintain sustainable energy development for generations is carbon capture and storage or sequestration (CCS) via electrochemical reduction. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) is an integrated step of CO2 capture and electrochemical CO2 conversion, using water and electricity to convert CO2 into fuels and valuable chemicals, especially formic acid. Multiple benefits of CO2 Electrochemical conversion include the ability to regulate reaction rates or selectivity finely through the applied voltage, modularity of electrolytic cells that allows extensive scalability, and effective integration with intermittent renewable energy sources. The efficiency of ECO2R processes can be improved through (i) electrode structure and modification, (ii) electrolytic cell (reactor), (iii) electrolyte selection and pH control, and (iv) operating conditions (pressure and temperature). However, finding suitable electrodes with high selectivity for formic acid formation remains the biggest challenge at the fundamental level. This article provides an overview of recent research on ECO2R electrodes, focusing on the application of different types of integrated electrodes (e.g., metals, metal oxides, alloys) and the effect of adding promoters or/and carbon supports. The synergistic effect of different materials, promoters, and carbon supports in the electrodes is essential for the enhancement of the ECO2R performance.

Climate change as an effect of global warming is an environmental problem that is currently a concern of many parties. The global warming is mainly triggered by emission of CO2 into the atmosphere due to human activities such as usage of fossil fuels as the energy source. Therefore, the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy as well as technology to capture and utilize the CO2 are highly necessary. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to produce various products, such as formic acid has advantages, due to mild reaction condition, the process is controllable, use minimal chemicals, and the application is relatively easy to scale-up. Formic acid has potential as a source of hydrogen carrier and can replace fossil-based fuels. Products from electroreduction of CO2 depend on electrons transferred during the reaction, which are generated by the configuration of electrode/electrocatalyst, applied potential, and electrolyte. In addition, the type of reactor system or electrolytic cell also plays an important role in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Carbon-based materials have potential as electrocatalysts for electroreduction of CO2 because of the porous structure, acid-base resistance, stability at high temperature, abundant availability in nature, and environmentally friendly. This mini review will discuss the electroreduction of CO2 in various electrochemical reactor systems using carbon-based electrocatalyst to produce formic acid using the SWOT analysis method.

Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2ER) coupled with water oxidation (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) presents a promising solution for effectively mitigating global warming. However, this process is compromised by the sluggish OER, which yields only undesirable O2. Here, we couple selective CO2ER with partial ethylene glycol oxidation (EGO) to concurrently produce formate in both half-reactions. The enhancement of active sites and optimization of formate selectivity are the principal objectives during the design of both electrodes. For CO2ER, redox stabilization of Sn-based cathodes is investigated via Pb doping, thus ultimately improving the Faradaic efficiency from 68% to ∼89%. To replace OER with EGO, we employed CuO@Ni(OH)2 on copper foam, reducing the applied potential by 200 mV at 50 mA/cm2. Finally, an EGO-coupled CO2 electrolyzer achieves 10 mA/cm2 at an overall cell voltage 180 mV lower than that of a conventional CO2 electrolyzer. This study showcases the integration of divergent electrochemical processes for concurrent electrosynthesis without precious metals to achieve cost-effective and sustainable formate production from CO2 and plastic waste.

The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to chemicals and fuels is expected to be a key sustainability technology. Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction technologies are challenged by several factors, including the limited solubility of carbon dioxide in aqueous electrolyte as well as the difficulty in utilizing polymer electrolytes. These considerations have driven systems designs to incorporate gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to bring the electrocatalyst in contact with both a gaseous reactant/product stream as well as a liquid electrolyte. GDE optimization typically results from manual tuning by select experts. Automated preparation and operation of GDE cells could be a watershed for the systematic study of, and ultimately the development of a materials acceleration platform (MAP) for, catalyst discovery and system optimization. Toward this end, we present the automated GDE (AutoGDE) testing system. Given a catalyst-coated GDE, AutoGDE automates the insertion of the GDE into an electrochemical cell, the liquid and gas handling, the quantification of gaseous reaction products via online mass spectroscopy, and the archiving of the liquid electrolyte for subsequent analysis.

The structural devise of photocatalytic materials are closely related to the separation of photogenerated carriers and the transport of charge, which is crucial to enhance the performance of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Here, a photocatalyst (CdS-SV@Co@NCNT) has been successfully prepared by growing cadmium sulfide nanoparticles with sulfur vacancies on N-doped carbon nanotubes through a simple solvothermal method. The intrinsic electronic structure is regulated by sulfur vacancies to promote photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, a larger specific surface area of Co@NCNT could expose more reaction sites and shorten the transfer distance of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the combination with Co@NCNT could effectively suppress the photocorrosion of CdS. The possible photocatalytic CO2RR path is further speculated by in-situ infrared test results, in which CO2 molecules adsorbed on sulfur vacancies preferentially generate important intermediate COOH*, which is then reduced to CO and CH4. Therefore, it exhibits a high CO yield of 263.3 μmol·g−1·h−1 and trace of CH4 while showing excellent stability. This research provides a novel idea for designing the photocatalysts with highly active and stability for CO2RR.

## 1 nm Tin Oxide Cluster for the Electrochemical Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formate at Low Overpotential

Due to its cost-effectiveness and high product selectivity, tin oxide has been regarded as a promising catalyst for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to formate. However, formate production is hindered by the high overpotential; there is a need to reduce the overpotential to enhance energy efficiency and lower electricity cost for the implementation of carbon utilization technology. Here, we report a facile synthesis method for 1 nm-sized SnO2 cluster catalysts, which can be used for CO2-to-formate conversion. SnO2 clusters were prepared through impregnation of porous carbon with a tin precursor solution. The SnO2 clusters showed a low overpotential, generating a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of -0.34 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. They also achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 90.5% and 81.5% at 200 and 300 mA cm−2, respectively. Their electrocatalytic performance was strongly dependent on the annealing conditions, which affected the particle size, electrochemical active surface area, and metal oxidation state. This paper presents a versatile method for synthesizing metal oxide cluster catalysts, apart from providing insights into the catalytic activity for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to formate.

The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CRR, which can convert CO2 into useful compounds at room temperature and ambient pressure by using electricity derived from renewable energy source), has been attracting attention in recent years. This is because it can convert CO2 into useful compounds, which is pertinent to establishing a next‐generation recycling‐oriented energy society. However, further improvement of the electrocatalyst is required to improve its activity, selectivity, and durability. Among these, copper (Cu) can synthesize various hydrocarbons from CO2 and has been the most studied electrocatalyst for the CRR over many years. In particular, regarding ligand‐protected Cu particles for the CRR, the size, shape, and ligands of Cu particles prepared by chemical reduction can be precisely controlled. In this review, we summarize previous research on the size‐dependence of the CRR by using Cu particles (nanoparticles and nanoclusters) prepared by liquid‐phase reduction, and discuss the current status of these studies for researchers on the electrochemical CRR.

Abstract The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) can achieve carbon recycling through renewable electrical energy. Before releasing the full potential of eCO 2 RR, the electrocatalysts still need improvement in terms of catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability. Two‐dimensional (2D) crystalline materials show a high aspect ratio with well‐defined crystal structures, which are promising electrocatalysts for eCO 2 RR. In this review, we briefly discuss the typical 2D electrocatalysts for eCO 2 RR. Subsequently, we provide a summary of the different strategies to improve the catalytic performance of 2D crystalline electrocatalysts for creating and modulating active sites. Finally, we end this review with the current challenges and future opportunities of 2D crystalline materials in the eCO 2 RR.

This study aims at identifying the carbon dioxide reduction (CDR) potential of large-scale and multi-purpose afforestation/reforestation at the global level with special emphasis on the Mid-Latitude Region (MLR). Applying a combined remote sensing/GIS approach coupled with biophysical forest and disturbance modeling under various climate change scenarios, we identify potential afforestation locations, inter-alia on abandoned agricultural land and on areas burnt from wild land fires. With the help of IIASA&#8217;s biophysical global forestry model (G4M), we calculate the associated land-based CDR potentials through carbon sequestration in afforested biomass and through climate risk-resilient and sustainable forest management dedicated to the supply of bioenergy plants coupled with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) facilities. Finally, three promising scenarios have been identified including I) afforestation; II) reforestation; and III) BECCS. In all scenarios, priority is put on sustainable forest management and nature/biodiversity conservation. Forest modeling results have been combined with recent data sets which have been overlayed in order to provide a unique basis to estimate the land-based CDR technologies&#8217; potential to mitigate climate change and contribute to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement. In the case of afforestation, preliminary results indicate a total potential afforestation area greater than 1 billion ha. &#160;The largest area potential for afforestation have been identified in the USA. Given the higher productivity (combined with large area available), Brazil is the country with the highest total CDR potential of close to 500 MtC/yr.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption and electron transport play an important role in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we have demonstrated a new class of diverse hollow ZnSnOx (ZSO) through the amorphization of hydroxides to enhance CO2 adsorption and accelerate electron transport. The amorphization is occurred by calcination process, as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectra. In particular, the ZnSnOx hollow spheres (ZSO HSs) achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH up to 92.7% at best, outperforming the commercial ZSO (Comm. ZSO, 83.9%). ZSO HSs also exhibit durable stability with negligible activity decay after 10 h of successive electrolysis. In‐situ attenuated total reflectance infrared absorption spectroscopy further reveals strong adsorption of CO2 and rapid intermediate configuration transformation in amorphous ZSO HSs. This work demonstrates the practical application of ZSO for CO2RR and provides a new insight to create efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.

Effective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate under mild conditions helps mitigate the energy crisis but requires the use of high-performance catalysts. The addition of a third metal to the binary metal catalyst may further promote the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate. Herein, we provided a co-electrodeposition method to grow CuSnBi catalysts on pretreated copper foam and discussed the effects of both pH value and molar ratio of metal ions (Cu2+, Sn2+, and Bi3+) in the electrodeposition solution on the electrocatalytic performance of CO2 to HCOO−. When the pH value of the electrodeposition solution was 8.5 and the molar ratio of Cu2+, Sn2+, and Bi3+ was 1:1:1, the electrode showed the highest FEHCOO− of 91.79% and the formate partial current density of 36.6 mA·cm−2 at −1.12 VRHE. Furthermore, the electrode kept stable for 20 h at −1.12 VRHE, and FEHCOO− was always beyond 85% during the electrolysis process, which is excellent compared to the previously reported ternary metal catalytic electrodes. This work highlights the vital impact of changes (pH value and molar ratio of metal ions) in electrodeposition liquid on catalytic electrodes and their catalytic performance, and refreshing the electrolyte is essential to maintain the activity and selectivity during the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOO−.

Purpose: This study analyzes the causal relationships between CO2 emissions and ODA, logistics, renewable energy, economic growth, and industrialization. Research design, data, and methodology: From 2006 to 2019, panel data related to CO2 emissions, ODA, logistics networks, renewable energy, economic growth, and industrialization were collected from a total of 84 countries. To analyze this model, panel unit root tests and panel co-integration tests were performed to confirm the stability and long-term causal relationships in the data. Subsequently, panel FMOLS and panel DOLS were used to identify variables affecting carbon dioxide, and pairwise panel Granger causality analysis was used to analyze causality between these variables. Results: According to panel FMOLS and panel DOLS analysis, ODA and renewable energy reduce CO2 emissions, but economic growth increases CO2 emissions. Conclusions: As a result of panel FMOLS and panel DOLS analysis, economic growth was identified as a factor in increasing CO2 emissions, and international development cooperation and renewable energy were identified as factors in reducing CO2 emissions.

Electrochemical co-reduction of CO2 and nitrates presents a promising alternative for urea production. However, the current electrochemical synthesis of urea faces challenges related to low selectivity and production rates. The development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts is the key to performance improvement of urea electrosynthesis. This minireview primarily focuses on the rational design of catalysts, starting with a mechanistic overview. In addition, the advancement of electrolyzers for urea electrochemical synthesis is also discussed aiming to articulate guiding principles of achieving high-rate production reaching industrial relevant level in the future.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR) has emerged as a promising approach for generating carbon-neutral liquid fuels by utilizing excess renewable electricity to convert CO2. This thesis aims to employ atomistic simulations by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate the mechanistic details of how transition metal sulfides and electro-organocatalysts can enhance the activity and selectivity towards desired products, including those containing C-H bonds and molecules with C-C bonds. For this project, three different electrocatalysts were designed computationally.
