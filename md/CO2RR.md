Efficient synthesis of CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via photochemical CO2 reduction holds promise for achieving carbon neutrality but remains challenging. Here, we present rare‐earth dual single atoms (SAs) catalysts containing ErN6 and NdN6 moieties, fabricated via an atom‐confinement and coordination method. The dual Er‐Nd SAs catalysts exhibit unprecedented generation rates of 1761.4 μmol g–1 h–1 and 987.7 μmol g–1 h–1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH, respectively. Through a combination of theoretical calculation, X‐ray absorption near edge structural analysis, aberration‐corrected transmission electron microscopy, and in‐situ FT‐IR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Er SAs facilitate charge transfer, serving as active centers for C−C bond formation, while Nd SAs provide the necessary *CO for C−C coupling in C2H5OH synthesis under visible light. Furthermore, the experiment and density functional theory calculation elucidate that the variety of electronic states induced by 4f orbitals of the Er SAs and the p−f orbital hybridization of Er−N moieties enable the formation of charge‐transfer channel. Therefore, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of *CO adsorption in achieving efficient conversion from CO2 to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via a novel rare‐earth‐based dual SAs photocatalysis approach.

Abstract As part of the reduction and elimination of anthropogenic emissions, carbon capture, and storage (CCS) has been applied in recent decades. One option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions GHG is to store carbon dioxide CO2 in deep saline aquifers. Due to their abundance and large capacity, deep saline aquifers make excellent storage sites due to their potential for long-term sequestration. In early 2006, in Salah Gas Krechba field in Algeria became the world's first onshore saline aquifer to begin sequestration. This paper will focus on new insights into surface CO2 monitoring. We will discuss the introduction of geochemical imaging as an emerging surface technique to monitor CO2, recently adopted to investigate and detect tracer gases leaks injected in 2007 from neighboring wells and the cap rock. In the following few pages, we will summarize the geochemical imaging survey process from the implementation design, samples signature measurement to chemical analysis using the sophisticated statistical geo-chemical methods in the final interpretation stage. As a conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of the geochemical data has allowed the Krechba team to investigate the CO2 leakage areas in the field and demonstrates to be an efficient valuable, and accurate method for CO2 monitoring

This study examines the effects of methanol–diesel blends on the emissions of a diesel engine, concentrating on carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HCs), and particulate matter (PM). Using a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine at varying torque settings (2 N m–6 N m), significant reductions in CO, CO 2 , HC, and PM emissions were observed with increasing methanol content. CO emissions reduced by up to 81.8%, CO 2 by up to 64.2%, HC by up to 80.4%, and PM by up to 23.5% with the MD11 blend. NOx emissions initially increased but decreased by up to 20% at higher torques with the same blend. These results highlight the environmental benefits of methanol–diesel blends and the need for effective NOx reduction strategies.

Abstract Background Haemodialysis treatments generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly as a result of the equipment, consumables and pharmaceuticals required. An internal audit demonstrated a 33% wastage of acid concentrate when using individual 5.0 L containers at a 1:44 dilution ratio. We therefore investigated whether changing the delivery system for acid concentrate would reduce wastage and any associated greenhouse gas emissions. Methods We calculated the difference for a 30-bed dialysis unit between receiving acid concentrate in single-use 5.0 L plastic containers versus bulk delivery for a central acid delivery system connected to the dialysis machines. Estimates of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions were made using the United Kingdom government database and other sources. Results A 30-station dialysis unit functioning at maximum capacity (3 shifts and 6 days/week), switching to bulk delivery and central acid delivery could realise an approximate total reduction of 33,841 kgCO 2 e/year; in reduced product wastage, saving 6192 kgCO 2 e, 5205 kgCO 2 e from fewer deliveries, and 22,444 kgCO 2 e saving from a reduction in packaging and waste generated, which equates approximately to a one tonne reduction in CO 2 e emissions per dialysis station/year. Conclusions Switching from delivering acid concentrate in individual 5.0 L containers to a central acid delivery system can result in substantial reductions in CO 2 e emissions within a dialysis clinic. The emission savings from reducing the single-use plastic packaging greatly outweigh any gains from eliminating wastage of acid concentrate. Dialysis companies and clinicians should consider reviewing the design of current and future dialysis facilities and policies to determine whether reductions in CO 2 e emissions can be made.

The paper discusses a case study of obtaining an airline pilot license in integrated training—the so-called “from zero to Airline Transport Pilot License”. The environmental implications of simulator-based training were examined across multiple dimensions. Key areas of research include the reduction of harmful exhaust gases pollution associated with traditional flight training activities. Based on our analysis, it can be stated that increasing the use of Flight Simulation Training Devices in pilot training should be significant consideration. This approach brings many benefits, especially ecological ones. Changing the training program and increasing the use of flight simulators can result in a reduction of CO2 emissions by up to 70%. Based on country specific electricity factors, CO2 emissions during flight training in each EU country were calculated. Using Levelized Cost of Electricity average value to calculate training costs in EU countries depends on the mix of energy sources (wind, photovoltaics, carbon and gas). The findings highlight the significant ecological advantages of simulator-based training methods in mitigating the environmental footprint of aviation operations. By seeking to minimize environmental disruption and increase training efficiency, the adoption of simulators is a sustainable approach to pilot training that is consistent with global efforts to mitigate climate change and protect natural ecosystems.

Preserving perishable foods, particularly fish, demands meticulous attention throughout the entire supply chain, from capture to consumption. The critical role of cold storage facilities in maintaining optimal conditions, encompassing temperature and humidity regulation, is indispensable. Nevertheless, these facilities pose a considerable challenge due to their substantial electrical energy consumption, which significantly contributes to operational costs. In addressing this challenge, the implementation of energy-efficient strategies, including the utilization of advanced equipment and real-time monitoring facilitated by automation technologies, becomes imperative. This research investigates an innovative integrated cold storage system situated in Tarrafal, Santiago, Cape Verde, which harmoniously incorporates wind, solar, and tidal energy sources. The primary objectives are to evaluate the energy efficiency, financial viability, and environmental impact across four distinct hypothesis. Hypothesis 1 entails the deployment of two R134a refrigeration units powered by the conventional public grid, while Hypothesis 2 adopts a transcritical CO2 system reliant on grid electricity, Hypothesis 3 integrates CO2 technology with autonomous renewable energy sources and Hypothesis 4 leverages CO2 for refrigeration coupled with seawater heat exchange and autonomous renewable energy generation. The research findings strongly favor Hypothesis 4, demonstrating emissions of 15880 kg CO2eq with an impressive 5-year return on investment. The autonomous electricity production associated with this hypothesis markedly reduces emissions by more than 90%. Despite an initial higher investment, Hypothesis 3 showcases financial viability, contributing significantly to long-term energy sustainability. The autonomous energy production in this scenario results in a noteworthy reduction of more than 600000 kgCO2 compared to conventional systems, underscoring the positive impact of integrating local renewable energy sources.

This study investigates the substitution of cerium (Ce) with mischmetal (MM) in cast Al-MM alloys, focusing on microstructure, hardness, tensile and compression properties, creep resistance, and coarsening resistance. Al-MM alloys with various MM compositions (Ce, Ce-50La, Ce-33La, and Ce-27La-19Nd, weight percent) exhibit near-eutectic and hyper-eutectic microstructures for Al-9MM and Al-12MM compositions, respectively, with similar as-cast hardness (~525 MPa). All Al-9MM alloys show tensile yield stress ~55 MPa, ultimate tensile strength ~130 MPa, and fracture strain ~8%.The microstructural and mechanical properties consistency demonstrates the flexibility of MM compositions in Al-MM alloys. Al-9MM exhibits excellent coarsening resistance, with minimal hardness reduction when exposed to 300 and 350 C for up to 11 weeks, and a modest ~15% hardness reduction at 400 C for 8 weeks, outperforming eutectic Al-12.6Si and Al-6.4Ni alloys. Additionally, Al-9MM shows higher creep resistance at 300 C compared to most precipitate-strengthened Al-Sc-Zr and solid-solution-strengthened Al-Mg/Mn alloys, but is outperformed by eutectic-strengthened Al-6.4Ni and Al-10Ce-5Ni alloys.The effect of casting cooling rate is investigated through wedge casting: Al-9Ce transitions from hypo- to hyper-eutectic as cooling rates decrease, while Al-12Ce consistently shows hyper-eutectic microstructures. Al11Ce3 lamellae become finer and more closely spaced with increasing cooling rates. Al-9Ce maintains steady hardness at high to moderate cooling rates but shows reduced hardness at lower rates, whereas Al-12Ce shows no change in hardness.With a 15% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, Al-Ce alloys where Ce is replaced with MM offer comparable mechanical properties and enhanced environmental benefits, highlighting the potential of MM as a sustainable alternative.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Light commercial vehicles are an indispensable element for the transport of people and the delivery of goods, especially on extra-urban and long-distance routes. With a view to sustainable mobility, it is necessary to think about hybridizing these vehicles to reduce the fuel consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter. These types of vehicles are generally powered by diesel and travel many kilometers a day. On the other hand, the use of light commercial vehicles in battery electric vehicle (BEV) configuration has already been started but is not receiving widespread recognition. In this panorama, starting from a study already developed for the hybridization of a plug-in light commercial vehicle in Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) condition, the simulation analysis has been extended to the plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) operating in real driving emission conditions (RDE). In particular, using Advisor software, a vehicle has been simulated in different plug-in hybrid configurations. The software has been validated with real operation data of a euro 6 diesel engine. The general hypothesis underlying the research consists in the possibility of using these vehicles in totally electric mode in the city and in hybrid mode outside urban centers; with the aim of reducing polluting emissions in populated city but completing the delivery mission during all phases of vehicle operation. The PHEV simulations have been performed on both WLTC and RDE condition. In the latter mode, particular attention has been devoted to the interpretation of data from GPS sensor: like the slope of the route or the presence of tunnels. The success of the simulation depends on a correct and careful reconstruction of the GPS data. Three vehicles with different hybridization factors have been simulated: 0.44, 0.56, and 0.67, respectively, with power equal to that of the base vehicle. The battery packs have been sized for the three hybrid vehicles and simulations were carried out in both Charge Depleting and Charge Sustaining configuration. In charge depleting for the highest hybrid configuration (HF=0.66), the results demonstrate that a reduction of up to 80% and 76% in fuel can be saved While a reduction up to 75% and 45% in NOx emissions can be achieved on WLTC and RDE cycle, respectively. On the other hand, when the battery is discharged, for HF=0.67, although consumption can be reduced by up to 45%, NOx emissions also increase by 183% even if ICE operation mode has to be better optimize for hybrid operation. Finally, even if the hybrid solutions is really convenient if compared to the conventional vehicle in terms of fuel savings and NOx pollutant emissions, about a realistic estimation of the CO2 reduction that can be achieved the use of electrical energy must be take into account.</div></div>

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">The worldwide markets around the globe endure far from meeting the originally arranged primary objective outlined under the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015: mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to retain global average temperature rise to well below 2°C by 2100 and making every effort to stay below a 1.5°C elevation of the average temperature. Today’s emissions are rebounding from an intermediate decline during the economic downturn related to the implications coming from Covid-19 pandemic. To get back on track with the realization of the targets of the Paris Agreement, research suggests that GHG emissions should be reduced by approx. 50% by 2030 on a guiding trajectory to reach net zero by around mid-century. Although these objectives are all averaged global targets, every sector and country/market need to participate, especially prosperous and more developed countries bear in general the higher responsibility to act.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">In 2020 direct tailpipe emissions from transport represented around 8 GtC02e, or approx. 15% of overall GHG emissions. This number elevates to nearly 10 GtC02e, if indirect emissions from electricity and fuel supply are added, accumulating to a total amount of roughly 18%. Following the latest tendency, direct and indirect emissions in transport could reach above 11 GtCOeq by 2050. Roughly 3/4 of transport emissions are related to land-based passenger and freight road transport. Emissions from aviation and marine transport account for the remaining 24% of the 2020 emissions. Efficiency enhancement and fuel change, including electrification, allow scaled emissions mitigation in the central scenario, and sustained action will be needed to ensure that by 2030 emissions are reduced by roughly 27% from 2020 levels. Reductions are foreseen to reach nearly 78% by 2050. When indirect emissions are included, transportation provides the opportunity to eliminate around 9.4 GtCOeq of emissions by 2050 (7 GtC02eq direct and 2.4 GtC02eq indirect), or around 13% of total mitigation.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">In this context, carbon neutrality imposes substantial changes in our energy mix. Hydrogen (H2) is in this mainstream scenario considered to take a key role as a carbon-free and versatile energy carrier. Combustion of hydrogen in an ICE offers the potential to accelerate the introduction of carbon-neutral mobility in the short to medium term at competitive cost due to the utilization of well-proven and mature technology elements. Given the high technological maturity of internal combustion engines (ICEs), there is an increasing interest in ICEs powered by hydrogen as a CO2-free solution for all kinds of vehicles and applications, incl. racing. Depending on the application functional parameters differ in the ranking between power output, efficiency, and reliability, besides the efforts for the conversion for changing the fuel type.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">The major intention and aim of this paper is given by the identification and description of the major modification and adaptation needs for the conversion of a classical Diesel engine towards hydrogen operation in order to pave the fast way forward to carbon-neutral propulsion systems in the mobility sector.
