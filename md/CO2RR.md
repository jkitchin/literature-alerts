Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) have emerged as highly efficient catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), providing a promising avenue to solve the carbon dilemma. Based on density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the capability of 12 tetra-atom transitional-metal clusters anchored on g-CN (TM4@g-CN) for CO2RR and found that all clusters have good stability on the substrate. Notably, the charge variation of the top metal atom (TM4) of six SCCs is close to zero which makes them readily donate electrons to the adsorbate CO2 and subsequent reaction intermediates. Our results demonstrate that CO2 can be efficiently reduced to HCOOH on Ni4, Cu4, and Au4@g-CN with low limiting potentials of −0.21, −0.22, and −0.19 V, respectively, outperforming the corresponding single-atom counterparts. Both ΔG(∗CO2) and ΔG(∗OCHO/∗COOH) exhibit a volcano relationship with the reaction activity, and the TM4 serves as electron reservoirs throughout the entire reaction process. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of cost-effective supported single cluster catalysts.

In this study, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have been incorporated into the g-C3N4/ZIF-67 heterojunction system as a photosensitizer to enhance photocatalytic conversion of CO2-to-CO. The GQDs are deposited onto the surface of g-C3N4/ZIF-67 using a simple water bath procedure. As expected, GQDs/g-C3N4/ZIF-67 presents outstanding performance in CO2 photoreduction. Among the GQDs/g-C3N4/ZIF-67 ternary photocatalysts, 7 GQDs-CN/ZIF-67 exhibits the best photocatalytic CO2 reduction ability with a CO yield of 51.71 μmol g−1, which is 5.05 and 1.87 times more than pristine g-C3N4 (10.24 μmol g−1) and g-C3N4/ZIF-67 (27.65 μmol g−1), respectively. This result shows that upon combination of GQDs with ZIF-67/g-C3N4, GQDs can be used as photosensitizers to improve the optical absorption capacity of the photocatalyst. Furthermore, GQDs serve as electron channels, facilitating the transport of photo-induced electrons from ZIF-67 to g-C3N4, which promotes photogenerated carrier separation efficiency. This study innovatively adds GQDs to the heterojunction and applies the prepared ternary composite to the CO2 photoreduction, which inspires a novel direction for the design of non-noble metal photocatalysts.

The development of functional artificial photosynthetic devices relies on the understanding of mechanistic aspects involved in specialized photocatalysts. Modified iron porphyrins have long been explored as efficient catalysts for the light‐induced reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards solar fuels. In spite of the advancements in homogeneous catalysis, the development of the next generation of catalysts requires a complete understanding of the fundamental photoinduced processes taking place prior to and after activation of the substrate by the catalyst. In this work, we employ a state‐of‐the‐art nanosecond optical transient absorption spectroscopic setup with a double excitation capability to induce charge accumulation and trigger the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Our biomimetic system is composed of a urea‐modified iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (UrFeIII) catalyst, the prototypical [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2’‐bipyridine) used as a photosensitizer, and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor. Under inert atmosphere, we show that two electrons can be successively accumulated on the catalyst as the fates of the photogenerated UrFeII and UrFeI reduced species are tracked. In the presence of CO2, the catalytic cycle is kick‐started providing further evidence on CO2 activation by the UrFe catalyst in its formal FeI oxidation state.

Numerous studies have shown a fact that phase transformation and/or reconstruction are likely to occur and play crucial roles in electrochemical scenarios. Nevertheless, a decisive factor (such as facet, phase etc.) behind the diverse photoelectrochemical activity and selectivity of various copper/silicon photoelectrodes is still largely debated and missing in the community, especially for possibly dynamic behaviors of metal catalyst/semiconductor interface. Herein, through in situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well‐defined facets on black p‐type silicon (BSi) is demonstrated to unprecedentedly reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal‐BSi interface, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light‐induced dynamic activation process. The presence of in situ formed silicide can significantly enhance photovoltage and deliver a record‐high onset potential above ‐0.4 V versus reversible reference electrode (RHE) for photoelectrochemical CH4 production. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu/Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu‐Cu distance, which efficiently restricts the C‐C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16‐fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.

Abstract Electroreduction of CO 2 to value‐added products is a promising strategy for CO 2 reuse, where copper has a unique ability to produce oxygenates and C 2+ products. Unfortunately, the electronic factors making copper so unique are unknown, which limits the ability to design improved catalysts. By combining in situ surface‐sensitive X‐ray resonant photoelectron spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, the complex electronic structure of copper is uncovered during the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . It is found that the pseudocapacitive charging of copper, produced by the incorporation of protons and electrons into the subsurface, facilitates the activation of CO 2 , while simultaneously increasing the barrier for H‐H coupling. The net result is that cathodic pseudocapacitive charge suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction and promotes the production of hydrocarbons and oxygenated products on copper. These results represent a new paradigm in the understanding of CO 2 reduction, highlighting the key role of pseudocapacitive charge in the reaction.

Introduction To achieve net-zero targets, it is essential to evaluate and model the costs and scalability of emerging carbon dioxide removal technologies like direct air capture with CO2 storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Yet such efforts are often impeded by varying assessments of the climate impact and potential contributions of these technologies. This study explores the future costs and scalability of DACCS and BECCS to advance net-zero goals. Methods We analyze expert opinions on these technologies’ potential costs and deployment scales for 2030, 2040, and 2050. Data was collected from 34 experts, comprising 21 DACCS and 13 BECCS specialists. They provided 90% confidence interval estimates and ‘best estimates’ for future costs and deployment under two International Energy Agency (IEA) policy scenarios—Stated Policies (STEPS) and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE). Results We find that BECCS costs start at a lower level but decrease more slowly, whereas DACCS costs decline more steeply from a higher initial cost. However, DACCS estimates varied significantly among experts, showing no convergence over time. Regarding potential scalability, both technologies are associated with substantially higher deployment under the NZE scenario. Yet the combined estimated capacity of DACCS and BECCS by 2050 is only about a quarter of the CO2 removals projected by the IEA for its NZE scenario (1.9 GtCO2). Discussion This study provides valuable insights into the future of DACCS and BECCS technologies in Europe, especially since our experts expect that DACCS and BECCS costs will be even higher (and deployment scales lower) than those predicted by recent IEA tracking, opening future research directions.

Aqueous electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into alcohol and hydrocarbon fuels presents a sustainable route towards energy-rich chemical feedstocks. Cu is the only material able to catalyse the substantial formation of multi-carbon products (C2/C3), however competing proton reduction to hydrogen is an ever-present drain on selectivity. Herein, a superhydrophobic surface was generated by 1-octadecanethiol treatment of hierarchically structured Cu dendrites, inspired by the structure of gas-trapping cuticles on subaquatic spiders. The hydrophobic electrode attained 56% Faradaic efficiency for ethylene and 17% for ethanol production at neutral pH, compared to 9% and 4% on a hydrophilic, wettable equivalent. These observations are assigned to trapped gases at the hydrophobic Cu surface, which increase the concentration of CO2 at the electrode|solution interface and consequently increase CO2 reduction selectivity. Hydrophobicity is thus proposed as a governing factor in CO2 reduction selectivity and can help explain trends seen on previously reported electrocatalysts.

One of the key challenges of room temperature aqueous CO2 electrolysis technology is the carbon losses because of carbonate formation. It is desirable if carbonate ions could be utilized concurrently for a useful process. Herein, we devise a strategy that enables in-situ electroreduction and assisted CO2 storage using a by-product of that reduction process and carbonate ions. By employing a Ag catalyst deposited on a gas diffusion layer, we demonstrate CO2 electroreduction and concurrent storage via mineralisation using seawater, as well as other calcium containing electrolytes. For example, CO2 electroreduction in 0.6 M Na2SO4 containing 400 ppm Ca electrolyte results in a Faradaic conversion efficiency to CO of ∼90 % at - 1.4 V vs. RHE (∼60 ± 6 mA cm−2), and concurrently stored CO2 as calcium carbonate. This bioinspired work offers a new avenue where CO2 storage is incorporated in a sustainable CO2 electroreduction technology.

Abstract Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) is a potential technology for converting the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), into carbon monoxide (CO) by employing renewable energy. SOECs have great potential, including high‐energy efficiency, fast electrode kinetics, and competitive cost; however, this technology still has challenges in developing highly active, robust CO 2 cathode electrocatalysts. In this work, we report the Ni‐doped lanthanum strontium calcium titanate (La 0.20 Sr 0.25 Ca 0.45 Ni 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 3−δ ) cathode for application as the cathode of CO 2 electrolysis with gadolinia‐doped ceria (Gd 0.1 Ce 0.9 O 1.95 ) electrolyte in SOEC. The exsolution of Ni nanoparticles is achieved by a simple in situ growth method at 800 °C. The Ni doping in LSCT significantly improved the electrochemical activity of the catalyst by increasing oxygen vacancies, and the Ni metallic nanoparticles can afford much more active sites for CO 2 reduction. The CO 2 electrolysis mechanism is studied by the distribution of relaxation time analysis of impedance spectroscopy. Ni‐LSCT renders a higher activity for electrolysis of CO 2 with an exceptionally high reduction current density of 3.89 A cm −2 at 2.5 V potential applied and 800 °C temperature with GDC (Gd 0.1 Ce 0.9 O 1.95 ) electrolyte. Ni doping is a crucial factor in controlling the electrochemical performance and catalytic activity in SOEC and GDC electrolytes, which is further helped by the high ionic conductivity.

The development of functional artificial photosynthetic devices relies on the understanding of mechanistic aspects involved in specialized photocatalysts. Modified iron porphyrins have long been explored as efficient catalysts for the light‐induced reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards solar fuels. In spite of the advancements in homogeneous catalysis, the development of the next generation of catalysts requires a complete understanding of the fundamental photoinduced processes taking place prior to and after activation of the substrate by the catalyst. In this work, we employ a state‐of‐the‐art nanosecond optical transient absorption spectroscopic setup with a double excitation capability to induce charge accumulation and trigger the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Our biomimetic system is composed of a urea‐modified iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (UrFeIII) catalyst, the prototypical [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2’‐bipyridine) used as a photosensitizer, and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor. Under inert atmosphere, we show that two electrons can be successively accumulated on the catalyst as the fates of the photogenerated UrFeII and UrFeI reduced species are tracked. In the presence of CO2, the catalytic cycle is kick‐started providing further evidence on CO2 activation by the UrFe catalyst in its formal FeI oxidation state.

As a major emitter of CO2, China needs to take responsibility for slowing down global warming. In this paper, the potential carbon emission intensity of provinces is firstly calculated using the non-radial directional distance function under the group- and meta-frontier techniques, and then six scenarios based on two factors (economic development and carbon intensity) are set up to estimate the emission reduction potential of China and each province. Considering the goal of carbon neutrality, the calculation of CO2 emission reduction potential quantifies the amount of emissions that can be reduced and the amount of emissions that should be balanced. Additionally, the degree of difficulty in achieving abatement potential is also calculated. The findings are as follows: First, assuming that the economic growth rate is reduced to 4.4% (achieving the second “100-year goal”) and each province adopts the most advanced low-carbon technologies, China could reduce carbon emissions by 5970.56 Mt compared to 2019 levels. To achieve net-zero emissions, the remaining 3824.2 Mt of carbon emissions should be removed by carbon reduction technologies. Second, the effect of slowing down economic growth and decreasing carbon intensity varies greatly among provinces. Hebei and Shandong should be prioritized as they have the greatest potential for emission reductions under both scenarios. Third, it is more difficult for Beijing, Shanghai, Hubei, Hunan, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Chongqing, and Sichuan to achieve the abatement potential and they require more effort to reduce the same amount of carbon emissions compared to other provinces. The study provides a reference for achieving carbon neutrality and helps provinces to develop differentiated emission reduction strategies.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stated an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and new regulations are under development to achieve this. To inform decisions on GHG regulations, this study has modeled the CO2 emission abatement potentials and costs towards 2050 for all ships above 400 gross tons. We explore CO2 reduction pathways based on marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) for 2030, 2040 and 2050. MACC is an important tool to assess the potential impact of regulations and can inform current policy debates as well as ship owners that need to develop their decarbonization strategies. Compared to previous work, we provide global MACCs taking into account the latest technologies and cost development, including alternative fuels. The updated MACC is based on more than 50 state-of-the-art abatement measures, 10 fuel systems and 8 fuels. The results indicate that the revised IMO GHG strategy ambition of 20–30 % GHG emission reduction in 2030, relative to 2008, can be reached at a marginal cost of 50–100 USD/tCO2; 70–80 % emission reduction in 2040 can be achieved at 230–240 USD/tCO2 and net-zero emissions in 2050 at a marginal cost of 300 USD/tCO2. The two inputs which have the highest impact on the results are the future cost of carbon-neutral fuels and growth in seaborne trade.

Hydrogen (H2), a relatively underexplored reductant in ferromanganese (FeMn) production, offers an attractive avenue for mitigating gaseous carbon (C) emissions. The reduction behaviour of South African Nchwaning manganese (Mn) ore using gaseous CO/CO2, H2/H2O, and H2 atmospheres was investigated experimentally in the temperature variation of 700, 800, and 900 °C. The effect of different gas compositions and temperatures was studied using a vertical thermogravimetric (TG) tube furnace. During pre-reduction, two parallel reactions occurred, namely the reduction of higher Mn- and iron (Fe) -oxides, and the decomposition of carbonates. After each test, decrepitation, chemical composition, phase transformation, and porosity were characterised. Using the rate of mass loss, a kinetic model was obtained to predict kinetic constants. The oxidation state of the higher Mn- and Fe-oxides was lowered during CO/CO2 and H2/H2O pre-reduction. Only during pure H2 pre-reduction was Fe2+ reduced to its metallic state, Fe0. The majority of carbonates decomposed in the presence of the CO/CO2 atmosphere at 900 °C, whereas in the presence of H2 in the reducing atmosphere carbonates decomposed at a higher rate and at lower temperatures. Additionally, the extent and rate of mass loss were expedited by increasing the temperature, employing H2-containing atmospheres, and lowering the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) of the H2-containing atmospheres. No significant trends were observed in ore decrepitation and porosity across various atmospheres and temperatures, except for decrepitation in the water vapour-containing atmosphere. The utilisation of a pure H2 atmosphere has a significant ability for pre-reducing manganese ores with carbonate content by expediting carbonate decomposition and promoting Fe-oxide metallisation, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ore treatment in metallurgical applications.

How to achieve CO2 electroreduction in high efficiency is a current challenge with the mechanism not well understood yet. The metal‐organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well‐defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self‐assembly of Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag+ ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5‐tris(1‐benzylbenzimidazol‐2‐yl) benzene (Ag‐MOC‐X, X= NO3, ClO4, BF4) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag‐MOC‐NO3 achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH‐universal electrolytes of 86.1%(acidic), 94.1%(neutral) and 95.3% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag‐MOC‐ClO4 and Ag‐MOC‐BF4 with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO2‐to‐CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO2 on unsaturated Ag‐site is stabilized by C‐H⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen‐bonding of CO2 in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO2 is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag‐centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag⋅⋅⋅X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag‐coordination geometry and host‐guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high‐efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.

The extensive utilization of fossil fuel energy has caused severe degradation to our environment, therefore the search for new clean efficient energy is the need of the hour. Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to solar fuels, and artificial photosynthesis, offer a promising solution for the energy crisis and global warming. Improving efficiency in the photo-reduction of CO2 to fuels involves developing highly efficient catalysts and optimizing photoreactor configuration. Photocatalysis is a process in which light radiations having energy equal to or greater than the band gap energy (Ebg) of a semiconductor strikes on its surface and generates electron (e−) hole(h+) pairs. The photogenerated electrons and holes participate in various oxidation and reduction processes to produce final products. This field focuses on harnessing solar energy to drive the conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels, showcasing significant potential for sustainable energy solutions. The global methanol market was valued at $30.9 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $38 billion by 2028, growing at 4.2% CAGR during the forecast period. For determining the feasibility of reactions on a larger scale, simulations must be performed at different conditions for obtaining higher conversion and cost-effective management of the process at the industrial level. So, a simulation of methanol photoreactors using different software was done to examining the kinetics of methanol reactors by employing ASPEN, DWSIM, and MATLAB software for simulating experimental data.

Due to the industrial revolution the emission of CO2 in the air reached to a noticeable degree (∼ 419.51 ppm) and continuous increase leading to effects effect adversely in the global climate. The utilization of captured CO2 through its electrochemical reduction into valuable fuels or chemicals has emerged as a promising technology to address climate change. Thus, among the various approaches electrochemical CO2 reduction is being progressively implemented for the conversion of CO2 into valuable fuels or chemicals. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art of such processes is lacking with respect to performance targets for scaling-up these technologies to industrial levels such as high current density (>200 mA/cm2) as well as stability for ∼30000 hours. Unluckily, in most of reported research these criteria found much lower. Distinctive properties of the electrocatalyst materials determine the selective, effective, and stable electrocatalysts of CO2 reduction to industrial scale. The gap between the reported and targeted performance stems from the available electrocatalyst materials that dictate the selectivity, efficiency, and stability of the electrochemical reduction of CO2. In this review, we summarize recent progress made on the modification of low dimensional (LD) nanomaterials and their nanohybrids for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Particular focus is placed on highlighting common challenges faced by these electrocatalysts, spanning recent advances on modified LD nanomaterials of CNTs, Graphene and MXenes. We further highlight areas that require additional attention in order for such catalyst materials to meet the required targets to enable the scale-up of CO2 electroreduction to the industrial scale.

As electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) approaches industrialisation levels, addressing the challenge of uncontrolled restructuring and deactivation of copper (Cu) catalysts during operation is essential for the regulation of this phenomenon. Two different catalysts were prepared, each showing distinct changes in ECR products selectivity over prolonged operation. The detection of dissolved Cu species during electrolysis confirms the intermediates mediated Cu0(s) dissolution mechanism at ECR potential, namely -0.8 to -1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. A dynamic equilibrium between dissolution and subsequent redeposition leads to morphological restructuring. Additionally, our findings suggest that the electrodeposition of dissolved Cu species is biased towards less active sites due to their lower coverage by reaction intermediates such as adsorbed CO. The iterative cycles of the dissolution-redeposition mechanism at ECR potential lead to the growth of the less-active Cu surface at the cost of the more-active one. This gradual yet persistent restructuring mechanism consequently shifts selectivity away from ECR and towards hydrogen production. Both catalysts exhibited this general behaviour, although at different rates.

Formic acid (FA) is a notable fuel product due to its atom economy, low activation energy, and applications in flow cells and hydrogen storage. While metal catalysts are typically used, selectivity remains a challenge. Here, an enzymatic catalyst is employed to selectively convert CO2 to FA as formate. This study documents the development of a computational model to examine the conversion of CO2 to formate under a wide range of conditions. The model examines the electrochemical reduction of a charge carrier, ethyl viologen (EV), and its subsequent use in an enzymatic catalyst to convert CO2 and protons in solution to formate. The model was first developed for a small-scale batch reactor, then later expanded to a dual-cell flow system, where the reduction of EV and production of formate are kept in separated cells, and flow rate is introduced as an additional variable parameter. While no studies have directly used all parameters addressed in the computations presented here, many of the conditions selected align with what has previously been used in experiments, and similar production rates and efficiencies are obtained. The most challenging parameters to study were charge carrier concentration and applied voltage, which showed optimal ranges in the cases studied for the batch and flow cell. While the study gives guidance toward which conditions would be favored experimentally to increase production rate and efficiency experimental studies should nonetheless be run at suggested optimal conditions to better adapt parameters made in both models.

The chapter provides significant and insightful methodological developments and strategies in the field of applied nanotechnology in particular applications in catalysis, pollution and energy. Owing to detrimental climate change and depletion of fossil fuels, we explore novel nanomaterial i.e., 'smart' metal-metal oxides and palladium-based electrocatalysts to achieve the requirements of sustainable and renewable resources. In the last decade, researchers have been engaged in the development of new and fundamental chemistries that will transform the field of nanotechnology and humans. In this view, the concept of green chemistry was coined in the early 1990s and was regarded as the engine in the development of new green nanomaterial. This transition is driving the investigation of green chemistry to mitigate environmental problems, replace traditional methods with novel designs and ultimately replace unsustainable chemistries. With this consideration, the preparation of catalytically active bio-inspired Ni/MgO and Cu/Cu2O/CuO/ZnO and Pd-based Pd-NiO/C, Pd/C and Pd-Cu/Cu2O/CuO/Zn using plant biological entities and waste materials as an eco-friendly, green route are explored. This chapter highlights the mechanism of interaction whilst exploring in-depth the leading edge of green-prepared nanomaterials in storage and energy conversion. This comprises studying the electrochemical phenomena of nanostructured materials, electrocatalysis, activity, stability, vital processes of polarisation resistance and diffusion-controlled systems at the nanostructured electrode surface through catalysis. A short overview and use of nanostructured material in energy spheres such as carbon dioxide electrochemical systems to produce energy fuels are also covered.

Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) was investigated in either organic or aqueous/organic media by employing three newly synthesized water-soluble Rh(Cp*)(n,n’-dihydroxy-2,2’-bipyridine) (n = 4, 5, or 6) in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) and triethanolamine (TEOA). Through studying the electron-donating effects of two hydroxyl groups introduced to the bipyridyl ligand, we found that the hydroxyl group positions of the catalyst greatly affect both the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction. More importantly, the HCOOH selectivity shows a dramatic increase from 14% to 83% upon switching the solvent media from pure organic to aqueous/organic mixture, where the H2 selectivity shows a reverse phenomenon. The enhanced HCOOH selectivity and the drastic decrease in the apparent H2 yield are well rationalized by the fact that the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation by the evolved H2 simultaneously proceeds as a dark catalytic reaction, which was also separately investigated under the dark conditions. Our DFT studies unveil that the exceptionally large structural strain given by the steric contacts between the 6,6’-dihydroxyl groups and the Cp* moiety plays a significant role in bringing about an outstanding catalytic performance of the 6,6’-subsituted derivative. The intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations on the hydride transfer steps leading to generate formate together the heterolytic H2 cleavage steps leading to afford the key hydridorhodium intermediates afford the results useful to interpret the observed phenomena. This study represents the first report on the water-induced high selectivity in CO2-to-HCOOH conversion, shedding a new light on the strategy to control the efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction.

Photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction, which harnesses the solar power to not only supply heat input but also generate charge carriers, represents an attractive and sustainable approach for solar-to-fuel conversion. Herein, an innovative Cs3Bi2Br9/Bi2S3 (CBB/Bi2S3) hybrid catalyst was elaborately designed by an electrostatic-driven self-assembling approach, which can achieve the effect of "kill two birds with one stone". On the one hand, Bi2S3 functions as a photothermal material owing to its photoinduced self-heating effect, which elevates the temperature of the catalyst for accelerating the catalytic reaction. On the other hand, Bi2S3 synchronously boosts charge separation by forming an S-scheme heterojunction with CBB, as revealed by first-principle simulation and a series of experimental techniques. Remarkably, the developed CBB/Bi2S3 hybrid affords an impressive CO production rate (RCO = 153.82 μmol g−1h−1) without any extra heat input. The present study can provide some enlightening guidance for developing high-performance photothermal catalysts for efficient CO2 conversion.

We constructed an integrated system comprising direct air capture (DAC) and direct carbonate reduction (DCR) to facilitate the industrial implementation of negative CO2 emissions. The DAC-DCR system demonstrated continuous CO synthesis from ambient air at room temperature, in contrast to conventional methods, including high-temperature processes and previously reported a batch-type method that connect DAC and DCR. The CO2-absorbing electrolyte, a K2CO3-KHCO3 aqueous solution, is circulated between the DAC and DCR subsystems. The CO2 captured from the air with the CO2-absorbing electrolyte is converted to carbonate in the DAC; subsequently, the carbonate is electrochemically reduced to CO in the DCR. This system monitored the CO2 capture rate, carbonate reduction rate, and pH of the CO2-absorbing electrolyte in real time. Controlling the carbonate reduction rate by adjusting the DCR reactor current enabled the balancing of carbon capture and carbonate reduction rates. Consequently, stable and continuous operation of a DAC-DCR system was achieved for over one hour for the first time. The DAC-DCR is more suitable for combination with intermittent renewable electricity, including photovoltaic and wind electricity, than the previous methods because all the processes in the system work at room temperature. Thus, the present proof-of-concept study is an important step toward the widespread use of DAC.

It has been a crucial challenge for countries worldwide to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. China is developing policies among various industries to peak CO2 emissions as soon as possible and expects the reduction of CO2 emissions through financial development. This paper explores the influencing mechanism of financial development on CO2 emissions based on panel data from provinces in China, considering constraints of technological innovation and fossil energy dependence among provinces and periods. Empirical results consistently indicate that the effect of China's financial development on CO2 emissions per capita is significantly negative, and it also presents an inverted U-shaped pattern. In those provinces or periods witnessing lower technological innovation and higher fossil energy dependence, the financial development has more significant effect on carbon emission reduction. This result suggests that regions with deficiencies in the development of technology industries, lower proportions of the tertiary industry, and a higher percentage of the secondary industry need to focus more on the value of financial development.

Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is a global priority. The concrete industry has a major role in this reduction since it accounts for about 8% of global CO2 emissions. Despite significant improvements in the sustainability of the production of concrete, one of the best solutions is still to improve the design and construction methods, such that the required quantities of concrete are reduced. Using, as a reference, a real case study, this study compares alternative shaft construction methodologies from engineering and sustainability points of view, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of each solution. To achieve this purpose, a back analysis is performed to ensure that the numerical model is accurately calibrated and the shaft construction methods can be adequately assessed. The results show that, while the considered methods are applicable and satisfy engineering requirements, the characteristics of the lining of the shaft could have been optimized, resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions by at least 50% without compromising the safety of the construction.

Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), the bottom covering technology for environmental protection and energy transformation, plays a vital role in reducing CO2 emissions and has become an international research hotspot. The safe operation of CO2 transport infrastructure is crucial to ensure the smooth implementation of carbon reduction actions. However, the understanding of disasters in carbon transmission infrastructure is not comprehensive and profound enough since CCS is still developing, which leads to few engineering standards on disaster prevention and mitigation of CO2 transport infrastructure. This paper provides detailed reviews, including the composition and characteristics of carbon transmission infrastructure, failure mechanisms. It is concluded that the characteristics of CO2 transport infrastructure damage fundamentally stems from the working fluid and environment, and novelty pointed out that future research hotspots are damage under multi-field coupling, damage detection and monitoring, design to reduce damage and repair after damage. The summary of existing research will be helpful for future academic research and engineering practice of CO2 transport infrastructure disaster prevention and mitigation.

The reduction of carbon dioxide to methane using hydrogen is an important process in biogas production. However, designing gas anaerobic digesters (GADs) based on this reaction presents several challenges. In this study, we developed an innovative spiral-pipe gas anaerobic digester (SGAD) to increase the displacement distance between the bubbles, thus prolonging the gas retention time and facilitating the reduction of CO2 to CH4 via H2. The process was successfully demonstrated by using a CO2/H2 ratio of 1:3 and a gas-feeding rate of 3.9 L Lr–1 d–1. During the experiment, more than 98% of the CO2 and 96% of the H2 were consumed, resulting in biogas containing ca. 86–96% CH4. Additionally, we applied our proposed evaluation methodology for assessing GAD performance to evaluate the performance of the SGAD. This methodology serves as a reference for evaluating and designing GAD systems. The innovative design of the SGAD and the corresponding evaluation methodology offer new insights into the design of reactors.

This work presents an experimental proof-of-concept study for a three-stage pyrolysis-catalytic dry reforming process for recovering valuable chemicals from waste plastics. It is demonstrated that depending upon the catalysts, process parameters and reactor configuration, plastic waste and carbon dioxide can be converted into a diverse array of valuable chemicals which can be used as secondary feedstocks in the chemical or petrochemical industry, thus decreasing dependency on fossil resources and contributing to waste reduction. For this work, waste polypropylene was thermally pyrolyzed and the emerging vapors were passed over HZSM-5 catalyst to obtain BTEX-rich pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gases containing mainly C1 to C4 hydrocarbons. The gaseous products were separated, mixed with CO2 and passed over Ni-silicalite-1 catalyst to obtain syngas, thus upgrading the pyrolysis gases and contributing to CO2 reduction. This study may provide new insights towards the development of processes for the chemical recycling of waste plastics and CO2.

Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) are target enzymes in the processing of tender coconut water (TCW). This study primarily evaluated the combined effect of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and mild temperatures on the PPO and POD deactivation of TCW. A factorial design was performed to investigate the effect of temperature (in the range of 35 to 85 °C), pressure (75 to 370 bar), and holding time (13 to 47 min) on the enzymic deactivation, physicochemical parameters, and color of the TCW. The percentages of reduction in PPO activity ranged from 3.7 to 100%, and POD ranged from 43.4 to 100%. The pH values of the freshly extracted and processed TCW were 5.09 and 4.90, and the soluble solids content were 5.5 and 5.4 °Brix, respectively. The holding time (t) had a significant effect (p ≤ 0.1) on the total color variation. As for the reduction of PPO activity, the temperature (T) and the interaction between pressure (P) and t had a significant effect. None of variables (P, T, or t) affected (p > 0.1) the POD reduction, pH, and soluble solids variation. The combination of SC-CO2 and mild temperatures is a promising intervention in the enzymic stabilization of TCW.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), emissions, greenhouse gases, and emission units are pivotal concepts shaping the energyclimate policies of many countries, collectively linked by the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS). Understanding this system, i.e. the taxation of CO2 emitters, becomes extremely important from the perspective of the profitability of existing fossil fuel thermal power plants. Montenegro, as the first non-EU country in the region, has implemented an emissions trading system similar to the EU ETS. If other countries do not adopt a specific form of taxing emissions from industries, they will face a cross-border CO2 tax that the EU plans to introduce from 2026. This study focuses on analyzing the challenges arising from carbon dioxide emissions from the only thermal power plant in Montenegro, particularly considering the obligations during the accession to the European Union (EU). There is a substantial need for emission reductions in line with strict EU standards while simultaneously maintaining the sustainability of the energy sector. The paper addresses challenges related to the payment of carbon dioxide emissions, exploring necessary economic mechanisms for calculation and management. The legal regulations governing this area were also analyzed. In fulfilling the obligation arising from the Law on Protection from Adverse Effects of Climate Change, an Emission Monitoring Plan for greenhouse gases was developed for the Pljevlja Thermal Power Plant. By preparing this document, the requirement for obtaining the Greenhouse Gas Emission Permit for the Pljevlja Thermal Power Plant for a period of 10 years was fulfilled. The permit defines the reporting frequency, including the submission of a Verified Greenhouse Gas Emission Report to the Environmental Protection and Nature Agency by March 1st of the current year for the previous year.

Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.

This study explores how elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels affects the growth and defense mechanisms of plants. We focused on Aristolochia contorta Bunge (Aristolochiaceae), a wild plant that exhibits growth reduction under elevated CO2 in the previous study. The plant has Sericinus montela Gray (Papilionidae) as a specialist herbivore. By analyzing primary metabolites, understanding both the growth and defense response of plants to herbivory under elevated CO2 conditions is possible. The experiment was conducted across four groups, combining two CO2 concentration conditions (ambient CO2 and elevated CO2) with two herbivory conditions (herbivory treated and untreated). Although many plants exhibit increased growth under elevated CO2 levels, A. contorta exhibited reduced growth with lower height, dry weight, and total leaf area. Under herbivory, A. contorta triggered both localized and systemic responses. More primary metabolites exhibited significant differences due to herbivory treatment in systemic tissue than local leaves that herbivory was directly treated. Herbivory under elevated CO2 level triggered more significant responses in primary metabolites (17 metabolites) than herbivory under ambient CO2 conditions (five metabolites). Several defense-related metabolites exhibited higher concentrations in the roots and lower concentrations in the leaves in response to the herbivory treatment in the elevated CO2 group. This suggests a potential intensification of defensive responses in the underground parts of the plant under elevated CO2 levels. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both abiotic and biotic factors in understanding plant responses to environmental changes. The adaptive strategies of A. contorta suggest a complex response mechanism to elevated CO2 and herbivory pressures.

Marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) and geological carbon storage in the marine environment (mCS) promise to contribute to the mitigation of global climate change in combination with drastic emission reductions. However, the implementable potential of mCDR and mCS depends, apart from technology readiness, also on site-specific conditions. In this paper, we explore different options for mCDR and mCS, using the German context as a case study. We challenge each option to remove 10 Mt CO2 yr-1, which accounts for 8-22% of projected hard-to-abate and residual emissions of Germany in 2045. We focus on the environmental, resource, and infrastructure requirements of individual mCDR and mCS options at a specific site, within the German jurisdiction when possible. Furthermore, we discuss main uncertainty factors and research needs, and, where possible, cost estimates, expected environmental effects, and monitoring approaches. In total, we describe ten mCDR and mCS options; four aim at enhancing the chemical carbon uptake of the ocean through alkalinity enhancement, four aim at enhancing blue carbon ecosystems’ sink capacity, and two employ geological off-shore storage. Our results indicate that five out of ten options would potentially be implementable within German jurisdiction, and three of them could potentially rise to the challenge. This exercise provides a basis for further studies to assess the socio-economic, ethical, political, and legal aspects for such implementations.    

    

## Harness the Co-Benefit and Avoid the Trade-off: The Complex Relationship between Income Inequality and Carbon Dioxide Emissions

Abstract Given the dual crises of climate change and rising economic inequality, it is imperative to improve the synergy between climate mitigation and income inequality reduction. Domestic income inequality is linked to nations’ carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through multiple theorized pathways. Using a multidimensional framework, multiregional input–output analysis, panel regression analysis, and a sample of 34 high-income nations from 2004 to 2015, I investigate the relationships between nations’ income inequality and four components of CO2 emissions with distinct implications for climate change mitigation: (1) emissions generated by domestic-oriented supply chain activities; (2) emissions embodied in exports; (3) direct emissions from end-user activities; and (4) emissions embodied in imports. I theorize that income inequality is heterogeneously related to the four emission components via different pathways. Results show that the relationships vary across emission components, change over time, and differ between inequality measures. The Gini coefficient is generally less influential on CO2 emissions than the income share of the top 10%. Notably, the income share of the top 10% is negatively related to direct end-user emissions from 2009 to 2011 and positively related to emissions in exports from 2011 to 2015, indicating variations in pathways both across emission components and over time—especially during and after the Great Recession. The findings underscore the multidimensionality in the income inequality-CO2 emissions relationship. Whether reducing income inequality can generate the co-benefit of emission abatement while avoiding a potential trade-off is a context-specific question that requires careful policy design and implementation.

Deep coal seams hold significant potential for coalbed methane (CBM) development and also offer advantageous formations for CO2 geological storage (CGS). However, deep coal seams in China often face challenges of low permeability and high in-situ stress, rendering conventional reservoir stimulation methods less effective. To overcome these challenges, we proposed an innovative method for horizontal well cavity completion in deep coal seams by using the abrasive supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) jet. The approach utilized the SC-CO2 jet to create multiple cavities in horizontal wells within the coal seams. It is expected to achieve stress relief, enhance permeability, and enable CO2 geological storage simultaneously. In this paper, we developed a fluid-thermal-structural coupling model to investigate the feasibility of abrasive SC-CO2 jet. The influence of pressure drops, jet temperature and jet distance were investigated. The findings indicated that the performance of abrasive SC-CO2 jets exceeded that of abrasive water jets in several key aspects, including jet velocity, impact strength, and abrasive erosion rate. However, the lower density and viscosity of SC-CO2 resulted in a diminished particle-carrying capacity. Compared to the abrasive water jet, a lower sand ratio or lighter density particles are recommended, when applying SC-CO2 in practice. Increasing jet pressure and temperature both contributed to improved rock breaking efficiency, yet through different mechanisms. An increase in jet pressure could provide more energy and enhanced the density and viscosity of SC-CO2, thereby boosting its particle-carrying capacity and improving the impingement effect. In comparison, the high temperature led to a reduction in both density and viscosity of SC-CO2. Although these changes in physical properties could increase jet velocity, it simultaneously diminished particle-carrying capacity, potentially increasing the risk of sand blockages during application. The flow field of swirling jet is accompanied by the high energy dissipation, impeding the formation of large-diameter cavities. In response, we proposed a design wherein swirling and conical nozzles were alternately arranged on the jetting tool. This scheme leveraged the distinct strengths of each nozzle type, aiming to enhance the efficiency of cavity construction using abrasive SC-CO2 jets.

Abstract Despite the negative externalities on the environment and human health, today’s economies still produce excessive carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, governments are trying to shift production and consumption to more sustainable models that reduce the impact of carbon dioxide emissions. The European Union, in particular, has implemented an innovative policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by creating a market for emission rights, the emissions trading system. The objective of this paper is to perform a counterfactual analysis to measure the impact of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. For this purpose, a recently-developed statistical machine learning method called matrix completion with fixed effects estimation is used and compared to traditional econometric techniques. We apply matrix completion with fixed effects estimation to the prediction of missing counterfactual entries of a carbon dioxide emissions matrix whose elements (indexed row-wise by country and column-wise by year) represent emissions without the emissions trading system for country-year pairs. The results obtained, confirmed by robust diagnostic tests, show a significant effect of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions: the majority of European Union countries included in our analysis reduced their total carbon dioxide emissions by about 20% during the emissions trading system treatment period 2005–2016, compared to the total carbon dioxide emissions that would have been achieved in the absence of the emissions trading system policy. Finally, several managerial/practical implications of the study are discussed, together with its possible extensions.

Biogas is obtained from the breakdown of biomass by microorganisms and bacteria in the absence of oxygen. Biogas is considered a renewable source of energy, similar to solar energy and wind energy. Biogas can be produced from biomass or bio-waste; thus, it is environmentally friendly. Biogas is obtained in a suspended monoxide decomposition process by anaerobic bacteria or in a fermentation process of decomposable materials such as agricultural manure, sewage, municipal waste, green waste (gardens and parks), plant material and agricultural products. Biogas is a renewable natural energy source that leaves effective effects on nature and industries. This gas is produced from the decomposition of organic materials, including animal manure, food waste and sewage. Fertilizers and waste produce biogas through anaerobic digestion (ie without the presence of oxygen). Biogas is a mixture of gases generated by decaying biodegradable material without the presence of oxygen. Its main contents are 50–70 % of methane (CH4) by volume, 30–50 % of carbon dioxide (CO2), and traces of other gases, like hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water vapor (H2O). CO2, H2S, and water vapor content in biogas may affect the performance and life of the energy conversion devices; consequently, their removal before end-use is essential for improving the quality of biogas. This combination is an ideal option for making renewable energy. The most important advantages of biogas (production of energy, reduction of the amount of discarded waste, reduction of pathogens, conversion of waste containing organic matter into high quality fertilizer, protection of vegetation, soil, water, increasing productivity in the field of livestock and agriculture) and It is also one of the disadvantages of biogas (incomplete and small technologies, containing impurities, the effect of temperature on biogas production, unsuitable for urban and dense areas, not affordable). For economical use of biogas, the fermentation process can be carried out under controlled conditions in a relatively simple device called a digestion reservoir. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art and presents future perspectives related to the anaerobic digestion process for biogas production. Moreover, a historical retrospective of biogas sector from the early years of its development till its recent advancements give an outlook of the opportunities that are opening up for process optimization.

Abstract The accelerating climate warming requires fast methods to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Here, we converted carbon dioxide into titanium carbide using four magnetrons which were sequentially operated to emit microwave on titanium swarf. Carbon dioxide molecules dissociated in the plasma to react with ionized titanium atoms to form a stable titanium carbide product, using a microwave frequency is 2.3 gigahertz and 800 watts electrical power for each magnetron. Results show a reduction of carbon dioxide concentration from 2000 to 385 ppm within 30 s. Titanium carbide could be further functionalized as a three-dimensional printed gas sensor.

Poly(amidoamine)-type dendrimers (PAMAM) were synthesized by divergent routes, and generations (G0.5, G1.0, G1.5, G2.0 and G2.5) along with hydroxylated half-generation polymers (G0.5-OH, G1.5-OH and G2.5-OH) were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture tests were performed using thermogravimetric analysis. Among the absorption temperatures tested, 60 °C was the most promising: 0.77, 1.08, and 1.14 mol CO2 L-1 for G0.5-OH, G1.5-OH and G2.5-OH, respectively, of CO2 and partial pressure of 45 kPa. This showed that dendrimers with larger molecular structures have more hydroxyl groups and consequently capture more CO2. However, at low partial pressures (< 2 kPa), CO2 solubility in PAMAM increased with temperature reduction, confirmed by Henry’s solubility constant (398.4 mol m-3 kPa-1, in G2.5-OH at 40 °C). According to the thermodynamic properties of CO2 solubilization, the process was spontaneous (∆Gsol < 0) and exothermic (∆Hsol < 0).

Abstract The steel making industry has one of the highest carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. The recycling route with the electric arc furnace (EAF) as the central aggregate emits less carbon dioxide in comparison to the blast furnace. Still, the EAF offers high potential for a reduction of the carbon dioxide emissions. One possibility is the substitution of natural gas by hydrogen in the auxiliary burners of the EAF. This substitution is investigated and analysed using a dynamic EAF process model. The model is able to simulate the combustion of natural gas as well as hydrogen. The differences in the operating conditions and properties by the hydrogen operated burners can be analysed in the results of the EAF process model.

Gas hydrates offer novel perspectives to achieve the reduction in substantial emissions of carbon dioxide and the recovery of abundant methane. This is attributed to the potential of carbon dioxide hydrates to efficiently sequestrate carbon dioxide in the form of solid phase, while abundant methane could be recovered through the dissociation of natural gas hydrates in hydrate deposits. Considering that the formation and dissociation characteristics of hydrates are in closely related with their performances of heat transfer and thermodynamic conditions, the efficiencies of sequestration and recovery can be influenced by the thermophysical properties of hydrates. Besides, carbon dioxide hydrates being stably formed in seabed sediments is a potential sequestration scheme of carbon dioxide, and abundant natural gas hydrates are found to be deposited in marine sediments. Therefore, this work is focused on hydrates and hydrate-bearing sediments, and comprehensively reviews their significant thermophysical properties including phase equilibrium data, dissociation enthalpy, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat capacity. Specifically, the principles of determination methods are clearly clarified, and strengths and weaknesses of various methods in accuracy and convenience are compared; Specific values of thermophysical properties are presented, and the variation characteristics of values are also analyzed based on different influencing factors. Additionally, the associated prospects are proposed.

As the world's largest coal consumer, China is facing the dual challenge of implementing strict coal reduction policies while heavily relying on coal. It is crucial to comprehend the pressures exerted on carbon dioxide emissions from coal consumption as China strives to transition towards a carbon-neutral era. This study defines and classifies the pressure of carbon dioxide emissions resulting from coal consumption, referred to as "carbon-coal pressure", in 30 provinces (including municipalities and autonomous regions) from 1997 to 2019. This classification enriches the study of the pressure on carbon dioxide emissions by specific energy types. By calculating the centre of gravity of the carbon-coal pressure and its evolution trends, the spatial pattern of the carbon-coal pressure and the evolution characteristics of the centre of gravity of the pressure are revealed. The results demonstrate that, despite the continuous growth in total coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in China, the carbon-coal pressure index exhibits a decreasing trend in certain regions, with significant inter-regional differences. Most provinces fall into the high-pressure and higher-pressure categories. The number of high-pressure provinces has decreased by 33% from 18 to 8, while the number of low-pressure provinces has risen from 0 to 1, and both higher and medium pressure types have increased. The overall stress index decreases from 0.79 to 0.7. The pressure centre displays a similar spatial trend to the overall changes in coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions centre, albeit with a smaller magnitude of change. Beijing stands out as the only province with low pressure.

As the problem of carbon emissions is becoming increasingly more serious around the world, how to balance carbon emissions reduction and economic growth has become an important issue in the field of environmental economics. China is the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter, and China's Low-Carbon Pilot (CLCP) policy has significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions and achieved expected benefits. However, is environmental quality improving at the expense of economic growth? This article selects macro panel data of 286 Chinese prefecture-level cities and micro data of Chinese industrial enterprises from 2001 to 2013, takes the CLCP policy implementation by five provinces and eight cities as a quasi-natural experiment, uses difference-in-differences (DID) method to investigate the causal effect of CLCP policy on regional economic growth and enterprise behavior. The results are as follows. First, the CLCP policy significantly promotes regional economic growth. Moreover, as the implementation time of the policy continues, environmental regulation has a greater effect of promoting economic growth. Second, although the CLCP policy significantly increases various production costs, it also promotes the growth of enterprises' output and benefits. Third, under the pressure of enterprise cost increase caused by environmental regulation, enterprises choose the positive way of strengthening internal management, improving efficiency and increasing innovation instead of choosing the negative way of trans-regional transfer, and finally achieve an improvement in output and benefits.

Abstract: In upcoming years , a lot of construction is going to happen leading to more cement consumption and more GHG’s emissions by default as an embodied carbon. Reduction of cement consumption is possible by partially repacing it with biochar which is a by-product of pyrolysis of biomass or adding it as an additive in cement mortar and concrete for carbon sequestration. Biochar is effective in carbon sequestration activity and results in high water and carbon dioxide holding capacity. Increase in biochar lead to increase in carbon sequestration . As pozzolanic activity lead to strength gaining characteristics and durability of concrete, this study focusses on investigating pozzolanic activity of biochar. Biomass considered in this study were walnut shells and pretreatment was done with 0.1 N HCl and and pozzolanic activity is checked by chapelle test by observing Ca(OH)2 fixation during the titration. It was observed that increase in temperature or Normality of HCl in pretreatment does not enhance pozzolanic activity of biochar . Hence pretreatment with 0.1 N HCl at room temperature for an hour is sufficient to enhance the pozzolanic activity of biochar with much high carbon dioxide sorption as compared to usual concrete without compromising with the strength of concrete. This study reclaims the potential use of biochar in concrete is reliable for carbon sequestration.

Purpose – Addressing the imperative of sustainable development and environmental conservation, this study investigates the intricate relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and annual fossil fuel subsidies in Slovenia and North Macedonia. Methodology/Approach – Utilizing regression analysis aligned with the indicators of the twelfth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), we discern trends in sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and total suspended particulate matter emissions. Findings – For every billion dollars in subsidies, North Macedonia experiences an average annual reduction of 40.073 kilotons in carbon dioxide emissions, while Slovenia sees an increase of 6.999.431 kilotons per year. The results point out the negative impact fossil fuel subsidies have on the environment by making fossil fuels more affordable, thus warranting further regulation by lowering or eliminating this type of subsidy. Implications – The implications address the need for research advancement and enhanced SDG reporting in North Macedonia, coupled with a demand for improved environmental indicators in Slovenia. Policymakers can leverage these findings for air pollution regulation, and managers can champion socially responsible practices for a green economy. Originality/Value – This study fills a critical gap in the literature regarding cross-country comparisons in this area, identified through a Scopus database search.

This study delved into the integration of biomass gas and natural gas within a Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) system. A Semi-Isolated Green Energy CCHP (SIGE-CCHP) model was devised to scrutinize the performance of co-firing equipment across diverse optimization objectives, while manipulating the proportions of natural gas and biomass gas as inputs. Findings revealed that escalating the share of biomass gas led to a reduction in carbon emissions but triggered an escalation in operational and maintenance costs. However, at an optimal mixing ratio of 1:1, carbon emissions exhibited marginal increments, coupled with a substantial decrease in operational and maintenance expenses. Notably, when prioritizing operational and maintenance costs, the system exhibited optimal performance, resulting in a notable 26.76% cost reduction. Conversely, when prioritizing carbon emissions, the system metamorphosed into a carbon sequestration entity, with a maximal capacity to absorb 2021.86kg of carbon dioxide. This study furnishes theoretical underpinnings for optimizing the operation of co-firing equipment, augmented by a sensitivity analysis aimed at intuitively elucidating the repercussions of varying mixing ratios on the system.

The Chinese government has implemented environmental regulations to address the deterioration of air quality associated with rapid industrialization. However, there is no consensus on whether environmental regulations are beneficial to environmental performance. The technical challenges related to endogeneity and spatial correlation may bias the estimation of the emission reduction effect of regulations. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the environmental performance of sulfur dioxide regulations in Chinese cities using a novel stochastic frontier model that introduces the single control function to correct estimation errors caused by spatial spillovers and endogeneity. Our analysis emphasizes that insufficient resolution of endogeneity or spatial spillovers may lead to underestimation or neglect of the environmental performance improvements achieved by these regulations. On the contrary, our revised research results indicate that regulations aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide emissions not only successfully control sulfur dioxide emissions, but also have a positive impact on reducing carbon emissions. In addition, we conduct in-depth research on the mechanisms by which environmental regulations improve performance by stimulating green technology innovation and promoting industrial structure upgrading. Based on our research findings, we propose policy recommendations aimed at establishing a technology exchange city cooperation mechanism to achieve synergistic emission reduction and strengthen regional factor circulation.

Abstract In order to comply with the trend of global climate change, countries are gradually promoting energy conservation and emission reduction, and prefabricated buildings have become one of the main paths for the construction industry to develop towards carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. This paper takes the box-shaped column flange connection achieved by plug welding-core sleeve in the dormitory building of Tongzhou Campus of the Affiliated High School of Capital Normal University in China as the research object. Based on the consumption quota of prefabricated construction projects and the actual project quantity, the carbon emissions of steel structure column connection joints at different phases are calculated by the emission factor method, and it is proposed that the production consumption of building materials plays a key role in energy conservation and emission reduction. This paper concludes that the box-shaped column flange connection achieved by plug welding-core sleeve in the construction phase of an assembled steel building emits 49.5% less carbon dioxide than a conventional full fusion-welded joint. And the reason for the high carbon emissions of the latter is mainly from the amount of materials and machinery required for full penetration welding. It further affirms the green and environmental protection effect of the assembled steel structure plug welding-core sleeve flange connection joint in actual projects, and provides a reference for related research.

Anaerobic digestion or anaerobic digestion is a biological process of degradation of organic matter in an anaerobic environment. It involves the degradation and stabilization of complex organic matter by a consortium of micro-organisms leading to methane-rich biogas that can be used as an alternative energy to fossil fuels. In addition, the use of biogas allows for the preservation of the environment and the sustainable development of rural areas and landlocked regions, as well as the diversification of energy resources, but also contributes to the development of agriculture through the production of organic fertilizer. In 2018, Senegal was ranked as the 15th world exporter of cashew nuts with a production of around 18,000 tons per year according to a study by PADEC (Support Program for the Development of Casamance). Four regions mainly invest in it: Kolda, Ziguinchor, Sédhiou, and Fatick. However, in the natural region of Casamance ( Kolda, Ziguinchor, and Sédhiou), each year, after the cashew nut campaign, more than 342,000 tons of cashew apples, pressed or not, are rejected without any recovery, thus degrading in the environment. In addition, rice is traditionally grown in Casamance and in some Diola circles, it had become one of the criteria of wealth, which explains why it occupied most of the cultivated areas and each year thousands of tons of rice husk are burned for elimination/reduction without any recovery. These immense annual productions of waste, without any recovery, in a context dominated by a deficit in cooking and lighting energy constitutes a form of energy resilience and motivates us to study the co-digestion of the rice husk (with a report of C/N equal to 101.317) on cashew apple pulp (having a C/N ratio of 23.201 ). The study of the co-digestion of rice husk and apple pulp at the laboratory scale with the inoculum reveals, that the co-digestion with pH correction contains 39.40% methane and 51.50% carbon dioxide after 49 days of production and 64.04% methane (CH 4 ) and 25.86% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) on the 96th day. For co-digestion without adjustment, production stopped on the 49th day with a production of 23.68% methane and 45.65% carbon dioxide.

Global climate change has become the greatest threat to humanity, and China is developing policies among various industries to peak CO2 emissions as soon as possible and expects the reduction of CO2 emissions through financial development. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2017, this paper uses fixed effect model and mediating effect model to explore the mechanism and effective pathway of financial development on CO2 emissions per capita among different regions in China. Empirical results consistently indicate that financial development has the significantly positive effect on CO2 emissions per capita, but the impact is inverted U-shaped. It means that only when the financial development in China gradually increased to 4.21 can achieve the goal of reducing CO2 emissions per capita. These results provide new explanatory ideas for the inconsistent direction of the impact of financial development on carbon emissions in existing studies. Then, the technological innovation and industrial structure are intermediaries for financial development to reduce CO2 emissions per capita, while the economic scale is the opposite. And it illustrates not only theoretical but also empirical results on the mediating pathways of financial development driven CO2 emission reduction. Under the theory of “natural resource curse”, in regions with high fossil energy dependence, the mediating effect of the economic scale is greater than that in regions with low fossil energy dependence. But the mediating effects of technological innovation and industrial structure from financial development on CO2 emissions per capita are all negative and more powerful than that in regions with low fossil energy dependence. This provides an important practical basis for the development of differentiated carbon reduction policies through finance in different fossil energy dependent regions.

This dataset was moved to: https://doi.org/10.34725/DVN/25231Tripa is the last remaining peat-swamp forest that harbours a poten tially viable Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) sub-population in a formally but not effectively protected area. It appears to be a simple showcase where current efforts to financially support reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) converge with biodiversity and social co-benefits. In practice, however, the situation is more complex. REDD+ efforts interact with global palm oil trade and regulatory approaches (the moratorium) to achieve national goals for emissions reduction under umbrella of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMA). To contextualize this debate, we assessed (i) land-use history and formal basis of palm-oil companies' rights; (ii) carbon (C) stocks, historical emission levels and potential emissions that can be avoided; (iii) economic benefits of land-use options and opportunity costs of avoiding emissions; (iv) biodiversity and environmental services; and (v) alternative options for "high C stock development" and employment generation. Natural forest cover declined (54 % in 1995, 18 % in 2009) while oil palm increased 4 - 39 %. Aboveground C stocks decreased from 148 Mg ha -1 in 1990 to 61 Mg ha-1 in 2009, leading to average annual emissions of 14.5 Mg (carbon dioxide) CO2e ha -1 year-1. While 41 % of these emissions yield less than American Dollar (USD) 5 of current economic benefits per Mg CO2e emitted and might be compensated by REDD+, nearly all new emissions derive from a breach of existing laws, regulations and voluntary palm-oil standards. Substantial investment in alternative employment is needed, rather than carbon payments per se, to support livelihoods in a low carbon emissions economy

Abstract One of the major challenges in the civil engineering sector is the durability of reinforced concrete structures against carbonation during the physico-chemical process of interaction of hydrated cementitious composites with carbon dioxide. This aggressive process causes carbon penetration into the reinforcement part, which affects the behavior of the structure during its lifetime due to corrosion risk. A countermeasure is using alternative cementitious materials to improve concrete texture and resist increased carbonation depth (CD). Considering that the CD test requires a long time and a skilled technician, this study strives to provide an alternative approach by moving from traditional laboratory-based methods towards artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for modeling the CD of sustainable concrete containing fly ash (CCFA). Despite the development of single AI models so far, it is undeniable that utilizing metaheuristic optimization techniques in the form of hybrid models can improve their performance. To this end, a new hybrid model from the integration of biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique with artificial neural network (ANN) is developed for the first time to estimate the CD of CCFA. The error distribution results revealed that 59% of the ANN predictions had errors within the range of (− 1 mm, 1 mm], while the corresponding percentage for the ANN-BBO predictions was 70%, indicating an 11% reduction in the prediction errors by the proposed hybrid model. Furthermore, A10-index highlighted a performance improvement of 78% for the hybrid model, which met the closeness of the predicted values to the observed ones, so that the value of this index for models of ANN and ANN-BBO was 0.5019 and 0.8947, respectively. Analyzing the cross-validation confirmed the reliability and generalizability of the developed model. Also, the three most influential variables in estimating the CD were exposure time (27%), carbon dioxide concentration (22%), and water/binder (18%), respectively. Finally, the superiority of the ANN-BBO model was verified by comparing it with previous studies’ models.

It takes several of years for dead organisms to get converted into fuels. Continues usage of these fuels is the major concern of depletion of it. BioCNG is a purified form of biogas, in which all unwanted gases (> 95%) of pure methane gas are removed. BioCNG is exactly the same as the natural gas. In India, we have inadequency in fuel sources, so we depend on oil-rich countries. Today there is a burning need for alternative fuels because fossil fuels are getting vanished. It is therefore necessary to find another source of energy.A replacement to those exhausting resources can be made by using Bio CNG. Bio-CNG is a good automotive fuel and has lower emissions and makes it more environmentally friendly than biogas and other fuels.. Bio-CNG is much cheaper than other competitive fuels. The biogas produced from anaerobic digestion are further processed and hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide are removed so that the final product contains 90% - 95% methane to be used as BioCNG. IIf the Government of India focuses on Bio CNG, then there will be a reduction in imports of petroleum products, thus saving a significant amount of foreign exchange every year.

Abstract In theory, market-based regulatory instruments correct market failures at least cost. However, evidence on their efficacy remains scarce. Using administrative data, we estimate that, on average, the EU ETS – the world's first and largest market-based climate policy – induced regulated manufacturing firms to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 14-16% with no detectable contractions in economic activity. We find no evidence of outsourcing to unregulated firms or markets; instead, firms made targeted investments, reducing the emissions intensity of production. These results indicate that the EU ETS induced global emissions reductions, a necessary and sufficient condition for mitigating climate change. We show that the absence of any negative economic effects can be rationalized in a model where pricing the externality induces firms to make fixed-cost investments in energy-saving capital that reduce marginal variable costs.

The way in which countries meet their United Nations Paris Agreement obligations, for CO2 reduction, depends on their energy usage and the nature of their electricity grid. As a case study, the focus is on the UK's energy usage and electricity grid. Twelve percent of the UK's CO2 emissions are from passenger cars, and substantial reductions in CO2 emissions result from moving to electrified vehicles. CO2 emissions are also reduced by increased public transportation and/or use of bicycles. CO2 emissions associated with lubrication of vehicles are negligible compared to the CO2 emissions associated with the energy needed to move the vehicles. Hurdles for UK customers moving to fully electric vehicles include price and charging infrastructure, so some customers are choosing hybrid electric vehicles, where there is both a battery and an engine. Some tribological issues associated with these hybrid electric vehicles are discussed in more detail.

This paper reports a system integration study on natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) with CO2 capture. When the alkali-based CO2 capture system is integrated into a typical NGCC power plant with 134.53 MW net power generation, the extracted steam for desorption unit and additional power for solid circulation lead to 12.05% thermal efficiency reduction. To fully recover the low-level heat of the CO2 capture system, a new integration configuration for NGCC with CO2 capture is proposed by adding an absorption heat transformer. In comparison, the new integrated system fully recovers the low-level heat of the CO2 capture system by sacrificing a portion of power generation. As a result, it provides 110.22 MW extra heat output in trade for a reduction of 21.07 MW power generation. Economic analysis shows that the cost of electricity and cost of avoided CO2 of the new integrated system are reduced by 8.26 $/MWh and 34.74 $/t CO2, respectively, due to the extra economic benefits by heat output.

Iron porphyrins are known to provide CH4 as an eight-electron reduction product of CO2 in a photochemical reaction. However, there are still some aspects of the reaction mechanism that remain unclear. In this study, we synthesized iron porphyrin dimers and carried out the photochemical CO2 reduction reactions in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) containing a photosensitizer in the presence of 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as an electron donor. We found that, despite a low catalytic turnover number, CH4 was produced only when these porphyrins were facing each other. The close proximity of the cyclic dimers, distinguishing them from a linear Fe porphyrin dimer and monomers, induced multi-electron CO2 reduction, emphasizing the unique role of their structural arrangement in CH4 formation.

Abstract: In the ever-evolving realm of urban transportation, the fusion of technological advancements and ubiquitous mobile connectivity has sparked a paradigm shift in how cities are navi- gated. This shift has led to innovative approaches in ridesharing and crowdsourcing, offering promising solutions to tackle traffic congestion, reduce emissions, and prioritize travel needs in urbanareas. Unlike traditional carpooling methods, where arrange-ments are made in advance, ridesharing in smart cities operates on real-time matching of drivers and riders, with priority given to factors such as destination and purpose.This study delves into the intricate dynamics of ridesharing and crowdsourcing for smart city transportation, investigating the complex interplay between technology and social factors.Additionally, it considers aspects of security, policy, and pricing strategies to ensure a seamlessand equitable experience for all stakeholders.Drawing insights from comprehensive case studies and practical implementations, this exploration highlights the advantages of ridesharing and crowdsourcing, including the reduction of carbon dioxide emis- sions and the prioritization of travel needs based on purpose. It offers guidance for stakeholders navigating the complexities and embracing the transformative potential of these innovative solutions in shaping the future of urban mobility.

It means that only when the financial development in China gradually increased to 4.31 can achieve the goal of reducing CO2 emissions. Then, the technological innovation and industrial structure are intermediaries for financial development to reduce CO2 emissions, while the economic scale represented by the real GDP per capita is the opposite. the higher the degree of fossil energy dependence is, the more positive mediating effect of economic scale on the relationship between financial development and CO2 emissions. But the mediating effects of technological innovation and industrial structure in regions with high fossil energy dependence is more powerful negative. Based on the above conclusions, the government should provide more financial policy support to promote financial development and especially improve the utilization efficiency of fossil energy and adjust the energy structure in regions with high fossil energy dependence through technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading respectively.

Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in building envelopes have the potential to reduce building energy consumption. The effectiveness of PCMs is influenced by their thermophysical properties, such as melting temperature and transition range, which affect their year-round utilization and overall energy impact. It is therefore important to identify PCM properties that are suitable for each climate. This study aims to identify the optimal melting temperature and transition range that minimize energy consumption across 16 U.S. cities using DOE reference buildings. In addition, to assess the realistic CO2 reduction potential of optimal PCMs, we utilize dynamic CO2 emission factors for electricity generation. The results highlight that improperly selected PCM can lead to increased energy consumption or CO2 emissions. It was also found that the optimal PCM transition range varies with outdoor temperature fluctuations. Optimal PCMs can lead to substantial energy savings—up to 18.7%, and significant CO2 reductions—up to 15% for electricity and 38% for natural gas. The results and findings support the deployment of PCM-wallboards with the optimal PCM properties tailored to the target location and climate, which enhance energy performance and contribute to buildings sustainability.

Reduction of the reservoir permeability during supercritical CO2 fracturing caused significant reservoir damage, which directly affects the crude oil recovery rate. This investigation explored a novel thickener for supercritical CO2 fracturing fluid, this CO2 thickener not only effectively improves the viscosity and rheological properties of CO2 fracturing fluid but also contributes to reduce reservoir damage and improve permeability. The research results indicated that the synthesized CO2 thickener (3 wt %) can increase the apparent viscosity of supercritical CO2 fracturing fluid to 7 mPa·s, and a 9% matrix permeability damage rate and a 0.5 mD permeability decrease value are shown in a 3% CO2 fracturing fluid. However, 3 wt % of commercial CO2 thickener only increases the apparent viscosity of supercritical CO2 fracturing fluid to 3 mPa·s, while the reservoir damage rate increases to 13%. Two thickeners exhibit completely different damage capabilities to the reservoir, and the synthesized CO2 thickener shows excellent characteristics of reducing reservoir permeability and is also conducive to protecting shale reservoirs. Furthermore, supercritical CO2 fracturing fluid containing synthetic thickeners has better temperature and shear resistance compared with commercial thickeners. This may be because the synthesized thickener and the micro grid formed by supercritical CO2 reduce the adsorption in shale crevices, but a large amount of commercial thickeners can adsorb on the surface of shale.

Introduction Many decarbonization technologies have the added co-benefit of reducing short-lived climate pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), creating a unique opportunity for identifying strategies that promote both climate change solutions and opportunities for air quality improvement. However, stakeholders and decision-makers may struggle to quantify how these co-benefits will impact public health for the communities most affected by industrial air pollution. Methods To address this problem, the LOCal Air Emissions Tracking Atlas ( LOCAETA ) fills a data availability and analysis gap by providing estimated air quality benefits from industrial decarbonization options, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). These co-benefits are calculated using an algorithm that connects disparate datasets that separately report greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants at U.S. industrial facilities. Results Version 1.0 of LOCAETA displays the estimated primary PM 2.5 emission reduction co-benefits from additional pretreatment equipment for CCS on industrial and power facilities across the state of Louisiana, as well as the potential for VOC and NH 3 generation. The emission reductions are presented in the tool alongside facility pollutant emissions information and relevant air quality, environmental, demographic, and public health datasets, such as air toxics cancer risk, satellite and in situ pollutant measurements, and population vulnerability metrics. Discussion LOCAETA enables regulators, policymakers, environmental justice communities, and industrial and commercial users to compare and contrast quantifiable public health benefits due to air quality impacts from various climate change mitigation strategies using a free and publicly-available tool. Additional pollutant reductions can be calculated using the same methodology and will be available in future versions of the tool.

Clathrate hydrates are crystals formed by guest molecules that stabilize cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Whereas thermodynamic equilibrium is well described via the van der Waals and Platteeuw approach, the increasing concerns with global warming and energy transition require extending the knowledge to non-equilibrium conditions in multiphase, sheared systems, in a multiscale framework. Potential macro-applications concern the storage of carbon dioxide in the form of clathrates, and the reduction of hydrate inhibition additives currently required in hydrocarbon production. We evidence porous mesomorphologies as key to bridging the molecular scales to macro-applications of low solubility guests. We discuss the coupling of molecular ordering with the mesoscales, including (i) the emergence of porous patterns as a combined factor from the walk over the free energy landscape and 3D competitive nucleation and growth and (ii) the role of molecular attachment rates in crystallization–diffusion models that allow predicting the timescale of pore sealing. This is a perspective study that discusses the use of discrete models (molecular dynamics) to build continuum models (phase field models, crystallization laws, and transport phenomena) to predict multiscale manifestations at a feasible computational cost. Several advances in correlated fields (ice, polymers, alloys, and nanoparticles) are discussed in the scenario of clathrate hydrates, as well as the challenges and necessary developments to push the field forward.

State-of-the-art therapy improves the five-year survival rate of patients under the age of 20 with cranial and craniospinal tumors by up to 74%. The urgency of dealing effectively with late treatment-associated cardiovascular complications is rising. Objective: We aimed to assess echocardiographic parameters and exercise performance in subjects with a history of complex treatment for cranial and craniospinal tumors in childhood. Methods: the study of 48 subjects who underwent cranial and craniospinal irradiation for CNS tumors in childhood and 20 healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers was conducted. The examination included hormone studies, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and, in the main group, echocardiography (ECHO). Results: In five (10.4%) patients, ECHO changes were detected after complex anti-cancer treatment: thickening and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets (2%), and reduction in the systolic LV and RV function (8% and 6%, respectively). Irradiation of various areas was a significant predictor for reduced exercise tolerance, hyperventilation at rest and upon exertion, and an increased ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide. Low exercise tolerance was associated with a younger age at the time of treatment initiation. Significant differences were noted between the control group and the childhood cancer survivors with endocrine disorders. Conclusions: The obtained data confirm the importance of regular cardiovascular and endocrine monitoring of this group of cancer survivors.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is increasingly being recognized as an effective and promising technology to reutilize CO2 and convert it into high value-added products, which presents a viable pathway to actualize carbon neutrality. Owing to the distinct affinity of copper (Cu) to the key intermediates of CO2RR, Cu-based electrocatalysts are emerging as highly promising catalysts for producing multi-carbon (C2/2+) products through CO2RR. Notably, the deliberate design and advancement of Cu-based catalysts stand as pivotal factors in actualizing efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2. In this review, we first elucidate the reaction pathways of Cu-based electrocatalysts for the synthesis of C2/2+ products. Then, various strategies toward the regulation of the structure of Cu-based catalysts are summarized, aiming to disclose the "structure-performance relationship". Meanwhile, the important advances regarding the catalyst/electrolyte interface engineering as well as the electrolyte optimization toward improved C2/2+ production are also included. Lastly, the review concludes by critically summarizing both findings and perspectives and how this promising field might advance in the future.

This paper examines the technical and economic influence of CO2 reduction measures on the design and operation of Dutch beam trawlers. This is done by means of a parametric model used to assess the influence on the overall design of the vessel. Technical feasibility is determined by meeting operational effectiveness requirements, maximum added draught, maximum added length, and a reduction of CO2 emission by at least 40%. Secondly the model evaluates the new energy carrier and fish storage layout as a result of additional required volume. Additional volume is gained within the net store, fish hold, or by hull extension. Additionally, various propeller configurations, waste heat recovery, and regenerative braking systems are explored to reduce energy consumption. The economic performance is assessed using yearly operational requirements, capital expenses of configuration, and total cost of ownership.

In the context of industrial CO2 capture, the need for efficient solvent regeneration at lower temperatures poses a significant challenge. Catalyst-assisted enhancement of the CO2 desorption kinetics has emerged as a potential solution. This study introduces a series of cost-effective and readily available sepiolite clay-based catalysts activated via simple acid treatments. This activation significantly enhances both the surface area and surface acidity, laying the foundation for more effective catalysts. Experimental results at a moderate temperature of 88 °C demonstrate the effectiveness of the prepared catalysts, resulting in remarkable improvements: up to a 163.6% increase in the CO2 desorption rate, an up to 83.6% increase in the desorbed CO2 quantity, and a reduction of up to 45.6% in heat duty compared with the baseline amine solution. Furthermore, the prepared catalysts exhibit facile separability through filtration and sustained stability over 10 cycles. To shed light on the underlying chemical processes, we also present a plausible reaction mechanism for the acid-activated sepiolite-catalyzed CO2 desorption reaction. This research holds promise for environmentally friendly and cost-effective amine regeneration processes in CO2 capture applications.

Methanol is emerging as a highly versatile energy carrier, presenting a wide range of applications in transportation and industrial processes, offering viable alternatives to hydrogen-focused strategies. Its role within the "Methanol Economy" and as an energy reservoir highlights its potential as both a transitional fuel and a crucial chemical feedstock. Beyond its function as a fuel, methanol contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts and environmental risk mitigation. Advancements in fuel cell technologies further strengthen methanol's position in clean energy solutions, positioning it as an essential component in constructing a sustainable energy framework. The methanol production process involves diverse pathways and technologies, each with distinct advantages and challenges. These pathways include natural gas reforming, coal and biomass gasification, and carbon dioxide hydrogenation. Catalytic processes, notably employing copper-based catalysts like Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, play a pivotal role despite persistent challenges such as thermal stability and selectivity. Catalyst promoters such as Au, ZrO2, and alkali metals significantly enhance catalyst performance. Various reactor technologies, including gas-phase and liquid-phase systems, efficiently manage synthesis reactions while optimizing efficiency and selectivity. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of different methanol production processes, the catalysts and promoters utilized, and various reactor technologies employed in this process.

CO2 pre-injection fracturing is a promising technology for shale reservoirs development, with multiple advantages for improving the complexity of fractures, the production of crude oil, and the sequestration of CO2. Previous research mostly focused on the CO2 effect on macroscopic mechanical properties of shale. However, there are many phenomena closely related to shale micro mechanical behavior. Therefore, this study presents a systematic investigation into the effects of CO2 on both macro and micro mechanical properties, as well as pore-fracture structures during CO2 pre-injection fracturing in shale reservoirs. The results show that CO2 can significantly decrease the tensile strength, uniaxial compressive strength, and elastic modulus of shale. With the increasing CO2 treatment time, the macro mechanical properties of shale decrease gradually. The microscopic experiments show that this significant decrease may be due to two mechanisms. The first is the significant decrease in the micro-mechanical properties of shale. The results of indentation analysis show that the microscopic elastic modulus and hardness of shale decrease by 51.3% and 63.3% after CO2 treatment. The second is the changes of the original shale framework. Pore-fractures structure analysis showed that after CO2 treatment, a large number of dissolution pores are generated in the shale matrix. Meanwhile, there are propagation of original fractures and opening of structural weak planes, which lead to the form of new fractures. Under the action of these two mechanisms, the macro mechanical strength of shale is reduced significantly. Therefore, in the field application, proper soaking following CO2 injection could lead to a significant overall reduction in mechanical strength, potentially lowering formation breakdown pressure, easing the requirements for treatment equipment, and enhancing fracturing effects.

Use of portland limestone cement (PLC) instead of ordinary portland cement (OPC) Type I/II in conventional concrete pavement and calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement instead of OPC Type III in rapid strength concrete (RSC) are commonly proposed strategies that could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the Caltrans highway network and meet the state's climate change mitigation goals. This study aims to quantify the potential global warming abatement cost of PLC and CSA cement use in California at the project and network level using life cycle cost analysis and life cycle assessment and to determine the benefits and disbenefits of the two proposed cement types. Results from the analysis showed that the abatement cost for replacing PLC with OPC Type I/II is $180/tonne of CO2-eq reduction, while the cost for replacing OPC Type III cement with CSA in RSC is $1,422/tonne of CO2-eq reduction.

This study investigates potential financing and management strategies that the Energy Corporation, a Chinese renewable energy company, could adopt in order to expand its green development projects. While China has made significant advancements in renewable energy, its heavy reliance on fossil fuels necessitates a shift towards a more sustainable energy system. To analyze the factors driving and impeding sustainability, this article provides an overview of China’s energy sector and policies. Through case studies of the Energy Corporation and other prominent renewable energy companies, the study showcases a range of demonstration projects, financing models, and management technologies that have the potential to accelerate the growth of sustainable initiatives. Recommendations from expert interviews are also provided, covering areas such as optimizing investment, monitoring distributed assets, and balancing social and environmental impacts. The results show that the Energy Corporation can effectively develop wind, solar, and energy efficiency projects nationwide by leveraging partnerships, utilizing green bonds, employing big data platforms, and engaging stakeholders, while also setting sustainability benchmarks. With a strategic approach, Energy Corporation aims to invest USD 1 billion over the next five years, targeting a renewable energy capacity of 5000 MW and a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. Achieving these goals would position Chinese companies as global leaders in the transition to renewable energy. The study also utilized an artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze the impact of increasing green jobs and renewable energy capacities on CO2 emission reduction and economic growth. The results indicate that green jobs have a more significant effect on reducing CO2 emissions compared to renewable energy capacities. When green jobs increased while energy capacities remained constant, substantial CO2 reductions were observed, but the economic growth was only 1%. However, when there was a moderate increase in jobs alongside a four-fold increase in renewable energy capacities, economic growth reached 4%. The neural network’s prediction errors were deemed acceptable based on linear regression analysis and experimental results.

Through photosynthesis, forests absorb annually massive amounts of atmospheric CO2. However, they also release CO2 back through respiration. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) determines how much carbon forests store or release. The mean seasonal cycle (MSC) is an interesting metric that associate phenology and carbon (C) partitioning-allocation within forest stands. Here we applied the 3D-CMCC-FEM model and analyzed its capability to represent the main C-fluxes, by validating the model against observed data, questioning if the sink/source mean seasonality is influenced under two scenarios of climate change, in five European forest sites. We found the model showing under current climate conditions robust predictive abilities in estimating NEE. The analysis also reveals a consistent reduction of the forest's capabilities to act as a C-sink under climate change and stand-ageing at all sites. Such a reduction is modelled despite the number of annual days of C-sink in evergreen increasing over the years, indicating a consistent downward trend. Similarly, deciduous forests, despite maintaining a relatively stable number of C-sink days throughout the year and over the century, show a reduction in the overall annual C-sink capacity. Overall both types of forests at all sites show a consistent reduction in their future mitigating potential.

Transportation serves as a cornerstone of economic development and is a significant contributor to carbon emissions. This study established a life cycle assessment model that incorporates refined carbon emission calculation parameters, streamlining the computation process while maintaining precision. A case study was conducted to quantify the life-cycle CO2 emissions of steel bridge deck pavements, a pivotal component within the transport network. The study suggests using the average annual CO2 emissions as a metric to gauge the carbon emission potential of steel bridge deck pavements with different service lives. This study addresses a void in the existing work by standardizing the grading of typical pavement diseases and quantifying the carbon emissions of the corresponding maintenance measures. It reveals that the pivotal determinant of life-cycle CO2 emissions for steel bridge deck pavements is the service performance of the paving material. Comparative analysis indicates that epoxy asphalt concrete could be deemed a low-carbon material, achieving a 77.6% reduction in life-cycle carbon emissions compared to gussasphalt concrete. Emissions during the maintenance phase constitute 66.7%–71.4% of the total life-cycle emissions, predominantly due to end-of-life and traffic delay units. The methodology and calculated data presented herein can inform subsequent carbon reduction strategies in transportation and promote the development of resilient infrastructure, thus making a substantial contribution towards carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation.

Design of Ni catalysts with carbon resistance by well diminishing the carbon deposition rate remains a great challenge for dry reforming of methane (DRM). Herein, Ni1–xCox bimetallic (x = 0.1, 0.2) catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method. In-situ XRD was used to reveal the transformation from precursor TiC to NiTiO3/TiO2 and Ni1–xCoxTiO3/TiO2 (x = 0.1, 0.2) with perovskite structure during calcination at 700 °C. Compared to monometallic Ni/TiO2 after reduction, Ni0.8Co0.2/TiO2 and Ni0.9Co0.1/TiO2 after subsequent reduction exhibited higher initial catalytic activity. Furthermore, Ni0.9Co0.1/TiO2 possessed superior stability with CH4 and CO2 conversions of 30% and 46%, respectively, in comparison with the decline of catalytic performance on Ni0.8Co0.2/TiO2 in DRM at 700 °C for 10 h. The main origin for the enhanced stability on the former catalyst was originated from no carbon deposition, as evidenced by the restricted CH4 dissociation at 503 °C and the promoted CO2 activation via more available oxygen vacancies on bimetallic Ni0.9Co0.1/TiO2.

Global efforts to avert climate change cannot be successfully addressed without tackling the emission of methane from soil and other ecosystems. Methane is a greenhouse gas that retains heat in the atmosphere and causes global warming. Its production is the last step of organic matter decomposition and is produced by methanogenic archaea bearing the functional gene – mcrA (Methyl-coenzyme M reductase). Methane production involves the reduction of acetate or carbon dioxide in a microaerophilic or anaerobic environment under the catalytic actions of methyl coenzyme M to generate methane. On the other hand, methane oxidizing bacteria, also known as methanotrophs, through the catalytic actions of the pmoA gene (particulate methane monooxygenase), oxidize methane and reduce its emission to the atmosphere. In essence, production and consumption of methane both happen within the soil. Methanotrophs and methanogenic microbes inhabit the same soil environment. In fact, a shift in the balance between methanogens and methanotrophs activities and abundance could influence either increase in soil methane emission and control or the corresponding effects on global warming. In this review we highlight recent advances on the drivers of methane flux, pmoA and mcrA genes abundance, methane emission and control, linking microbial functional genes abundance to soil function, and examining methods for studying the abundance of pmoA and mcrA genes in the soil. We also highlight gaps that need to be filled and the impact of the mcrA to pmoA gene ratio in driving the methane emission rate in the soil. We also discussed the various abiotic factors that control pmoA and mcrA gene abundance

Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an innovative cyclic process for fuel combustion to intrinsically separate carbon dioxide. In this process, oxygen and fuel are contacted by an intermediate oxygen carrier (OC), a metal oxide/metal that can alternately be reduced and oxidized. In this study, a yolk (Al2O3)–shell (ZrO2) was synthesized as the support of the OC and 20 wt % copper oxide was impregnated on the surface of it. The structure and cyclic reduction–oxidation (redox) performance of the CuO-impregnated yolk–shell sample were compared with those of CuO-impregnated core (Al2O3)–shell (ZrO2) and CuO-impregnated alumina oxygen carriers in the CLC process. The synthesized OCs were characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) dot mapping. A homogeneous coating of the zirconia on the alumina was obtained for the yolk–shell material. The pore size distribution became narrow in the presence of the zirconia coating. Furthermore, a yolk–shell architecture prevented the contact between the yolk (Al2O3) and the copper oxide materials, and CuAl2O4 spinel formation was inhibited. The obtained results showed that the oxygen transport capacities of the 20CuO/Al–C@Zr (yolk–shell support), 20CuO/Al@Zr (core–shell support), and 20CuO/Al oxygen carriers are 3.80, 3.47, and 3.4 wt %, respectively. The oxygen carrier with the yolk–shell support exhibited the highest activity, oxygen transport capacity, and coke formation resistance.

The hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4 has gained considerable interest in terms of sustainable energy and environmental mitigation. In this regard, the present work aims to investigate the adsorptive concentration and CO2 methanation performance over Co/Fe and Ni/Fe bimetallic catalysts supported on fumed alumina-silica SA96 support at 170–450 °C and under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method, subjected to calcination and further reduced with hydrogen, and their performance in CO2 methanation was investigated in a hydrogen-rich 2%CO2–55%H2–43%He gas mixture. In this study, we describe the crystal and mesoporous structures of the prepared catalysts by in-situ XRD and ex-situ nitrogen adsorption, evaluate the NiFe and CoFe metal surface states before and after catalysis by XPS, visualize the surface morphology by SEM, estimate the catalytic activity by gas chromatography, and investigate the adsorbed surface species, showing the presence of *HCOO/*HCO and *CO intermediates, determine two possible pathways of CH4 formation on the studied catalysts by temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry, and correlate the structural and surface properties with high CO2 conversions up to 100% and methanation selectivities up to 72%. The latter is related to changes in the elemental chemical states and surface composition of CoFe and NiFe nanocatalysts induced by treatment under reaction conditions, and the surface reconstruction during catalysis transfers the part of active 3d transition metals into the pores of the SA96 support. Our thorough characterization study with complementary techniques allowed us to conclude that this high activity is related to the formation of catalytically active Ni/Ni3Fe and Co/CoFeOx nanoscale crystallites under H2 reduction and their maintenance under CO2 methanation conditions. The successfully applied combination of CO2 chemisorption and thermodesorption techniques demonstrates the ability to adsorb the CO2 molecules by supported NiFe and CoFe nanocatalysts and the pure alumina-silica SA96 support.

Metallic iron (Fe) typically demonstrates the unfavorable catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), mainly attributed to the excessively strong binding of CO products on Fe sites. Toward this end, we employed an effective approach involving electronic structure modulation through nitrogen (N) integration to enhance the performance of the CO2RR. Here, an efficient catalyst has been developed, composed of N-doped metallic iron (Fe) nanoparticles encapsulated in a porous N-doped carbon framework. Notably, this N-integrated Fe catalyst displays significantly enhanced performance in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, yielding the highest CO Faradaic efficiency of 97.5% with a current density of 6.68 mA cm–2 at −0.7 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The theoretical calculations, combined with the in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy study, reveal that N integration modulates the electron density around Fe, resulting in the weakening of the binding strength between the Fe active sites and *CO intermediates, consequently promoting the desorption of CO and the overall CO2RR process.

Abstract As air traffic rebounds from its large drop during the Covid-19 crisis, civil aviation needs to continue addressing its climate impact. Knowledge of aircraft trajectories is essential for an accurate assessment of the CO2 (and non-CO2) climate impact of aviation. Here we combine an aircraft trajectory optimization algorithm and a global database of aircraft movements to quantify the impact of airspace restrictions due to conflict zones on CO2 emissions. Among current restrictions, we show that the Russian ban of its airspace to Western airlines following the invasion of Ukraine has the largest impact. Our analysis reveals an initial reduction of flights to and from East Asia that would have crossed the Russian territory. Routes then gradually reopened by making a detour, which led to an average increase in fuel consumption of 13% on the affected routes, with a greater impact for flights to and from Europe (14.8%) compared to flights to and from North America (9.8%). Although these flights represent only a small fraction of the daily flights, the large detours have increased global aviation CO2 emissions by 1% in 2023, equivalent to a quarter of the yet-to-be-achieved efficiency gain potential from improved air traffic management.

Due to being in an acidic CO2 environment and high-pressure underground, the stress corrosion phenomenon on the inner wall of the CCUS wellbore is more pronounced, with the possibility of wall thickness reduction and crack propagation, which affects the integrity and storage reliability of the wellbore. This article conducted indoor experiments on stress corrosion of oil casing, and characterized the stress corrosion through magnetic memory detection technology. Through experiments, the stress corrosion morphology of specimens under different concentrations, stresses, and defects was obtained. The microstructure of the stress corrosion site was observed using SEM electron microscopy, and the stress corrosion situation of the material in CO2 was observed, laying a foundation for magnetic memory detection; A stress corrosion detection method under CO2 environment was proposed, and the magnetic memory detection method was used to measure that the more severe the stress corrosion, the more obvious the magnetic signal mutation; The shape and morphology of different defects vary, but the main factors affecting magnetic memory signals are concentration and loading force. This article verifies the feasibility of magnetic memory in stress corrosion detection through experiments, and characterizes the stress corrosion situation using magnetic memory signals, which is of great significance for non-destructive testing of wellbore stress corrosion in CO2 storage.

The design principle underlying the steam condensation and CO2 purification in a gas power plant with a focus on reducing CO2 emissions encompasses the deployment of a spray ejector condenser (SEC) and separator. This innovative system facilitates direct-contact condensation of steam with non-condensable gas (CO2) by interacting with a spray of subcooled water, seamlessly integrated with a T-junction separator mechanism aimed at yielding pure CO2. Because of decreased convective heat transfer and heightened diffusion resistance between the subcooled water and steam phases caused by CO2, the research examined the effects of various thermophysical parameters of the injected water, specifically temperature (20–40 °C) and pressure (12–16 bar) along with steam mass flow rates (2.2–4.6 gs) to improve heat transfer rates within the SEC. The SEC utilizes a Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model, wherein water is considered the continuous phase while the mixture of steam and CO2 constitutes the dispersed phase. Turbulence within the ejector is represented applying standard k-ε model. Furthermore, the separator employs turbulence and operates in three dimensions using the control volume method. The simulation of turbulent two-phase flow in the gas-liquid T-junction separator is conducted utilizing standard k-ε turbulence model and a mixture model. The results imply that the maximum temperature difference (ΔT) between inlet and outlet of SEC is observed when the steam mass flow rate is 2.2 (g/s) without CO2, while the presence of CO2 leads to a reduction in ΔT. Additionally, the performance of the SEC is notably affected by the optimal settings of water temperature and pressure, where lower coolant water temperatures (20°C) and higher water pressures (16 bar) contribute to improved condensation performance. Furthermore, the study explores the decrease in separation efficiency associated with elevated inlet mass flow rate, attributed to maldistribution in the vertical impact T-junction separator.

Summary Asphaltenes are heavy aromatic hydrocarbon compounds contained in reservoir fluids and may precipitate when the reservoir pressure is reduced by production or when gas is injected into the reservoir, and then further deposit on pore-throat surfaces causing reservoir damage. At present, the research on asphaltene precipitation and reservoir damage is carried out in conventional reservoirs, and the influence of CO2 injection under high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) conditions has not yet been clearly understood. In this work, we combined perturbed-chain statistical association fluid theory (PC-SAFT) calculation, experiments, phase-state simulation, and numerical simulation to predict the asphaltene precipitation with different pressures, temperatures, and amounts of injected gas and to clarify the influence on reservoir permeability and oil production when using CO2 injection. The results show that the precipitation of asphaltenes in the process of CO2 injection is the desorption of colloid-asphaltene inclusions caused by gas molecules and then the mutual polymerization process between dispersed asphaltene molecules. CO2 injection will increase the amount of precipitation and move the precipitation curve to the right side. The degree of permeability reduction caused by the deposition of asphaltenes in the core is 12.87–37.54%; the deposition of asphaltenes in the reservoir is mainly around the injection/production wells and along the injected gas profile. Considering asphaltenes, the oil recovery degree is reduced by 1.5%, and the injection rate is reduced by 17%. The reservoir pressure, temperature, and physical properties have a strong correlation with the degree of reservoir damage, while the initial asphaltene content has a low correlation. This work will be of great interest to operators seeking to enhance oil recovery by CO2 injection in deep reservoirs.

The atmospheric CO2 level is rising, and the consequent climate change is causing an increase in drought events. Furthermore, the CO2 level is known to induce changes in the physiological responses to stress in plants. Exogenous melatonin is suggested to play roles in the response of plants to abiotic stresses, including drought. We investigated physiological drought stress responses at ambient and elevated CO2 levels (aCO2 and eCO2) of melatonin-treated and untreated tomato plants, aiming to link effects of water use efficiency of photosynthesis at (WUELeaf) and stomatal conductance (gs) with the hormonal regulation of stomata. Tomatoes grown at eCO2 had reduced water use of both irrigated and drought stressed plants during the progression of drought at the whole plant level. This was also reflected in a CO2-affected increase in WUELeaf at eCO2 across irrigated and drought-stressed plants. These CO2-induced effects were mediated through stomatal closing and reductions in stomatal pore area rather than stomatal density or size. Abscisic acid (ABA) and its conjugated form, ABA glucose ester (ABA-GE), increased at drought stress in aCO2, while only ABA-GE increased at eCO2. Contrary, salicylic acid (SA) increased to a greater magnitude at drought stress in eCO2 than aCO2. Melatonin treatment showed no effects on the stomatal regulation. Our findings imply that eCO2 changes in the balance of hormonal effectors in stomatal regulation during drought, shifting from it ABA to SA regulation, suggesting to consider stomatal reactions at eCO2 in a perspective of a hormonal interplay rather than only ABA.

The introduction of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks leads to an increase in energy consumption and higher operational costs for mobile network operators (MNOs). Consequently, the optimization of 5G networks' energy efficiency is crucial, both in terms of reducing MNO costs and in terms of the negative environmental impact. However, many aspects of the 5G mobile network technology itself have been standardized, including the 5G network slicing concept. This enables the creation of multiple independent logical 5G networks within the same physical infrastructure. Since the only necessary resources in 5G networks need to be used for the realization of a specific 5G network slice, the question of whether the implementation of 5G network slicing can contribute to the improvement of 5G and future sixth-generation networks' energy efficiency arises. To tackle this question, this review paper analyzes 5G network slicing and the energy demand of different network slicing use cases and mobile virtual network operator realizations based on network slicing. The paper also overviews standardized key performance indicators for the assessment of 5G network slices' energy efficiency and discusses energy efficiency in 5G network slicing lifecycle management. In particular, to show how efficient network slicing can optimize the energy consumption of 5G networks, versatile 5G network slicing use case scenarios, approaches, and resource allocation concepts in the space, time, and frequency domains have been discussed, including artificial intelligence-based implementations of network slicing. The results of the comprehensive discussion indicate that the different implementations and approaches to network slicing pave the way for possible further reductions in 5G MNO energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions in the future.

This paper investigates the feasibility of iron powder energy generation systems on board a semi-submersible crane vessel. This is done using a design model that integrates design information and a simulated mission profile to determine a hybrid iron powder setup split. This setup is then placed within a set of vessel designs to calculate a base level feasibility looking at the draft, stability, and emissions decrease. For those concepts that were technically feasible, the new hybrid iron powder setup contributed to a reduction of CO2 up to 25-50% and a reduction of NOx emissions between 15-50%, depending on the mission profile.

The climate in the Mediterranean region is expected to become warmer and drier but future projections of precipitation are uncertain, especially in the Northern part. Additionally, the difficulty in determining the plant physiological responses caused by CO2 rising complicates the estimation of future evaporative demand, increasing the uncertainty of future aridity assessments. Vegetation responses to rising CO2 are expected to increase radiation use efficiency and reduce stomatal conductance, hence increasing plant's water use efficiency. These effects are often neglected when estimating future drought and aridity. Hence, the main objective of this study is to estimate the effect of climate change and vegetation stomatal conductance reduction on projected water balance components and the resulting impact on aridity in a medium-sized catchment of Central Italy. We validate and couple a hydrological model with climate projections from five regional climate models and perform simulations considering the vegetation responses or not. Results show that their inclusion significantly affects potential evapotranspiration. The other water balance components, namely actual evapotranspiration, water yield, percolation, and irrigation, are also influenced but with less significant changes. Considering or not the CO2 suppression effect on stomatal conductance, coupled with the uncertainty related to precipitation, highly affects the estimation of future aridity as the future climate classification ranges from "humid" to "semi-arid" depending on the simulation and climate model, even if model outputs need to be evaluated cautiously with CO2 concentration higher than 660 ppm.

Acute hyperoxia (i.e., breathing air consisting of 100% oxygen, O 2 ) reduces muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), positioning hyperoxia as a potential anti-hypertensive therapeutic. However, the link between hyperoxia and MSNA has not been established in females. We tested the hypothesis that males would exhibit greater reductions in MSNA during hyperoxia than females. We tested healthy females (n=18, 27±5yr, body mass index [BMI] 23±3kg/m 2 ) and males (n=13, 27±5yr, 25±3kg/m 2 ) of similar age (P=0.99) and BMI (P=0.08). Integrated MSNA, blood pressure, and end-tidal O 2 (ET O2 ) and CO 2 (ET CO2 ) were measured during normal room air breathing (BSL; 3-min) and hyperoxic breathing (100% O 2 ; 3-min). Integrated MSNA was quantified as burst frequency (BF; bursts/min), amplitude (BA; a.u.), and total MSNA (a.u.); blood pressure was quantified as mean arterial pressure (MAP). Baseline MSNA BF was not different between females and males (24±7 vs 23±8 bursts/min, respectively, P=0.68); MAP was lower in females than males (85±7 vs 93±7 mmHg; p<0.01). Hyperoxia increased ET O2 (effect of cond: p<0.01) and reduced ET CO2 (effect of cond: p<0.01) in a manner similar between sexes for ET O2 (sex*cond: P=0.56) whereas ET CO2 decreased more in females than males (sex*cond: P=0.01). Overall, hyperoxia evoked reductions in MSNA BF (effect of cond: P=0.02) but not BA (effect of cond: P=0.80) or total MSNA (effect of cond: P=0.26). Nadir MSNA responses during hyperoxia unveiled sex differences insofar as total MSNA was reduced consistently only in males (sex*cond: P=0.04); within the females we observed the presence of sympatho-inhibitors and non-inhibitors. Whereas female and male inhibitors reduced total MSNA via substantial reductions in BF and non-significant reductions in BA, female non-inhibitors demonstrated limited reductions in BF (P=0.11 vs inhibitors) coupled with increases in BA (p<0.01 vs inhibitors), resulting in no net change in total MSNA (p<0.01 vs inhibitors). Overall, these findings indicate sex differences exist in the sympathetic response to hyperoxia, in marked variability in the female sympathetic response to acute hyperoxia.

The formation of dual-atom catalysts or heteroatom ligand modulation is the most promising strategy for optimizing single–atom catalysts (SACs) for the more efficient conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals. However, heteroatom ligands introduced into the dual-atomic sites are expected but still under-explored. In this study, a dual-atom Fe–Ni pair electrocatalyst with N– and S–coordination in porous carbon nanosheets was conceptually predicted for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO (CO2RR). In contrast to SACs and traditional diatomic catalysts (DACs), joined S–coordination can balance the cooperative activities of Fe and Ni sites, making the CO2 adsorption configuration bidentate at both Fe–Ni sites. This regulation leads to a substantial change in CO* adsorption from Fe to Ni sites, facilitating CO desorption and boosting the electrocatalytic CO2RR. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained FeNi–NSC catalyst achieves high selectivity with the Faradaic efficiencies for CO of 96.1%, and a remarkable activity with the turnover frequency of 6526.9 h–1 at −1.0 V, which were over 4.5 and 2.5 times of those from the single Fe or Ni sites. This work gives us insight into designing highly effective catalysts guided by theoretical calculation.

Tandem photovoltaics applying perovskite on silicon are considered to be a possible route to sustaining continuous efficiency improvements and price reductions. A meaningful market share for such tandems is, however, at least a decade away. Herein, a comprehensive prospective life cycle assessment was conducted, comparing the full life cycle of monofacial and bifacial silicon/perovskite tandem panels with single-junction silicon panels produced up to 2050. The end-of-life included the recovery of silicon and silver. Climate change impacts per kilowatt hour were projected to decrease by two-thirds over time. Tandem panels are expected to reach impacts of 8–10 g CO2-eq/kWh in 2050, while single-junction panels may reach 11–13 g CO2-eq/kWh in 2050. Other midpoint impact categories with substantial contributions to damaging human health and ecosystem quality were toxicity, particulate matter formation, and acidification, with tandems having lower impacts in each category. Reductions in impacts over time are mainly the result of grid mix decarbonization and panel efficiency improvements. Balance-of-system and recycling were found to contribute substantially to these impact categories. To ensure that tandem panels provide environmental benefits, annual degradation rates should not exceed 1% for monofacial or 3% for bifacial tandems, and refurbishment of panels with advanced degradation is crucial.

The high demand for carbon-based products within pyrometallurgy is placing the industry in an increasingly challenging position to meet stringent requirements. To transition away from fossil carbon carriers, biochar emerges as a sustainable and CO2-neutral alternative, presenting a viable solution without necessitating fundamental adjustments to plant technology, unlike hydrogen as an alternative reducing agent. Prior investigations have underscored the potential of woody biomass pyrolysis products for CO2-neutral metallurgy. Nonetheless, it is imperative to recognize that biochar must meet distinct requirements across various metallurgical processes. This paper conducts a comparative analysis between biochar and petroleum coke using thermogravimetric analyses, surface measurements, reactivity assessments, and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the performance in a furnace for simulating the Waelz process, specifically regarding ZnO reduction, is scrutinized. The results illustrate the optical differences between petroleum coke and biochar and the significantly higher reactivity and specific surface area of biochar. When used in solid–gas reactors, it is observed that due to its high reactivity, biochar reacts more vigorously and carbon is completely consumed. However, during the reduction of ZnO, only minor differences were monitored, making biochar comparable to petroleum coke. Therefore, under certain constraints, biochar can be considered a potential substitute for metallurgical solid–gas reactions.

ملخص : لقد تزايد الطلب على المصادر المتجددة للطاقة ، ويرجع ذلك إلى المزايا العديدة التي توفرها هذه المصادر وعلى رأسها الحد من إنبعاثات الغازات السامة والضارة بصحة الإنسان. وتلعب الطاقة الشمسية على وجه الخصوص ـــ كمصدر من مصادر الطاقة المتجددة ـــ دوراً واعداً في كل من الدول النامية والمتقدمة على حد السواء. فهي من ناحية مصدر نظيف للطاقة وصديق للبيئة لأنه يمكن استخدامها في توليد الكهرباء دون أن يصاحب ذلك انبعاث للغازات الدفيئة أو الغازات السامة مثل ثاني أكسيد الكربون وأكسيد النيتروجين وغيرها، ومن ناحية أخرى فإنه من السهولة بمكان تركيب الخلايا الشمسية على أسطح المنازل وبالتالي يمكن أن تكون وسيلة لإنتاج كهرباء نظيفة في المناطق الريفية. وعلى الرغم من المزايا التي توفرها الطاقة الشمسية إلا أن استخدامها في توليد الكهرباء في مصر مازال محدوداً للغاية ولا يتناسب على الإطلاق مع الإمكانات المتوفرة في مصر من هذا المصدر من مصادر الطاقة المتجددة. Abstract The demand for renewable sources of energy is increasing due to the many advantages provided by these sources, mainly the reduction of toxic and harmful emissions of human health. Solar energy in particular - as a source of renewable energy - plays a promising role in both developing and developed countries. It is a clean source of energy and environmentally friendly because it can be used to generate electricity without accompanying emissions of greenhouse gases or toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and others. On the other hand, it is easy to install solar cells on rooftops and thus can be a means to produce clean electricity in rural areas. Despite the advantages offered by solar energy, its use in generating electricity in Egypt is still very limited and is in no way commensurate with the potential available in Egypt from this source of renewable energy sources.

Abstract Lightweight and multifunctional polymer foams reveal a promising prospect, in terms of reducing energy consumption, and saving materials and resources. Herein, carbon dioxide (CO2) was captured through three amines, such as ethylenediamine (EDA), 1,3-propylenediamine (PDA) and 1,2-cyclohexanediamine (TRK). CO2 then released under heat, used as a foaming agent in the preparation of polyethylene (PE) foams. Cyclodextrin nanosponge (NS) was used as a heterogeneous nucleating agent and a carrier for complex of captured CO2. Evaluation system was developed to control the conditions of combine process, such as thermal and crystallization properties. Results showed that TRK was the proper CO2 capture candidate, with mass ratio of 1:4 for NS and TRK (NS:TRK-CO2(1:4)), and the release temperature of CO2 was 137 ℃. Foamed PE composite was prepared by molding process with NS:TRK-CO2(1:4). The optimum cell morphology was obtained with 5 wt% NS:TRK-CO2(1:4), the cell diameter was 116 µm, and the cell density was 7.9×104 cell/cm3. The best fabricated microcellular PE/NS:TRK-CO2(1:4) composite presented excellent mechanical, thermal and sound insulating performance. The maximum tensile strength of the PE composite was 25.48 MPa, and the maximum bending strength was 11.27 MPa. The impact strength was 5.77 KJ•m-2, more than 1.5 times higher than pure PE. The thermal conductivity was as low as 0.076 W/m•k, the sound absorption coefficient was 0.737 at 1500 Hz, and the noise reduction coefficient was 0.459.

The oil and gas industry currently faces the dual challenges of improving extraction efficiency and reducing environmental impacts. Traditional well monitoring technologies are increasingly unable to meet the demands of modern oil and gas extraction due to technological limitations and environmental concerns. Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology, which utilizes optical fibers as sensing elements, enables real-time and accurate monitoring of the CO2 injection process in wells. However, DAS technology encounters issues such as weak amplitude signals and noise interference in practical applications. In response, a comprehensive method for processing and interpreting DAS logging data for CO2 injection wells has been proposed. This method involves restoring amplitude signals through wavefront energy compensation and applying Gaussian filtering and wavelet threshold denoising algorithms for noise reduction. The processed results are classified using the K-Medoids clustering algorithm and the CO2 absorption volume in the injection layer is calculated using the integral area method. The accuracy and practicality of this method have been validated through comparative analysis with pulse neutron oxygen activation logging results. This approach aims to address the challenges faced by DAS technology in the oil and gas industry, thereby providing technical support for the efficient, environmentally friendly, and intelligent management of oil and gas fields.

Reduction of waste and carbon footprint can be optimized. Awareness of carbon sources and quantification of the waste are two key parameters. To our knowledge, there is no study in France on waste production by the surgical team during the operation in orthopedic surgery, in a global scope. Therefore, we performed an observational investigation aiming to: 1) quantify and characterize the weight of the wastes generated after a panel of orthopedic procedures, 2) calculate the CO2 footprint generated by these wastes and extrapolate the figure at the national scale.

Crystalline porous framework materials have attracted tremendous interest in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction owing to their ordered structures and high specific surface areas as well as rich designability, however, still suffer from a lack of accuracy in regulating the binding strength between the catalytic sites and intermediates, which is crucial for optimizing the electrocatalytic activity and expanding the product types. Herein, we report three new kinds of vinylene‐linked metal‐covalent organic frameworks (TMT‐CH3‐MCOF, TMP‐CH3‐MCOF and TMP‐MCOF) with continuously tunable D‐π‐A interactions by adjusting the structure of the monomers at the molecular level for realizing efficient electroreduction of CO2 to formate for the first time. Interestingly, compared with TMT‐CH3‐MCOF and TMP‐MCOF, the TMP‐CH3‐MCOF exhibited the highest HCOO‐ Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO‐) of 95.6% at ‐1.0 V vs RHE and displayed the FEHCOO‐ above 90% at the voltage range of ‐1.0 to ‐1.2 V vs. RHE, which is one of the highest among various kinds of reported electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the catalytic sites in TMP‐CH3‐MCOF with unique moderate D‐π‐A interactions have suitable binding ability towards the reaction intermediate, which is beneficial for the formation of *HCOO and desorption of *HCOOH, thus effectively promoting the electroreduction of CO2 to formate.

Selective electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol has economic value and environmental significance. However, the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction toward ethanol are still low due to the sluggish kinetics of C–C coupling and the intense competition of hydrocarbon production. Herein, we report a layered tandem catalyst consisting of Cu nanosheets with a Cu(111)-oriented surface and Ag nanoparticles, which can effectively shift the selectivity from hydrocarbons to ethanol. The Faradaic efficiency of ethanol was improved from less than 30% on bare Cu(111) to 56.5 ± 2.6% on the layered Cu/Ag tandem catalysts, with a partial current density of 356.7 ± 9.5 mA cm–2. In situ Raman spectroscopy results and density functional theory calculations suggest that the high selectivity toward ethanol can be attributed to the asymmetric *CH2–CO coupling mechanism, which is facilitated by the selective generation of *CH2 species on (111)-facet-exposed Cu nanosheets and the high local CO concentration supplied by the Ag catalyst.

The development and improvement of catalytic processes require a detailed understanding of catalyst dynamics, reaction mechanisms, and structure–activity relationships inside catalytic reactors, from the laboratory to production scale. This paper presents the methodology of iso-potential operando DRIFTS for measuring the profiles of surface adsorbates inside catalytic reactors. Iso-potential operando spectroscopy (IPOS) in general and iso-potential operando DRIFTS in particular separate the functionality "catalytic reactor" and "spectroscopic cell" from each other. The catalytic reactor is equipped with a mechanism of spatial sampling and spatial temperature measurement. A small fraction of the reaction mixture is sampled locally in the reactor and transferred continuously into a spectroscopic cell containing a very small amount of the same catalyst as in the reactor. The temperature is set to the same value as is locally measured in the reactor. In this way, the catalyst in the spectroscopic cell is exposed to the same chemical potential as that locally in the catalytic reactor. It is hypothesized that it takes on the same structure, the same surface adsorbates, and shows the same reactivity. IPO DRIFTS is applied to CO2 methanation on Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Two surface adsorbate species, adsorbed carbonyl (*COads) and adsorbed formate (*HCOOads), are detected. The band intensity of *HCOOads decreases along the catalyst bed with the CO2 concentration in the gas phase, identifying surface formate as a kinetically relevant intermediate. This finding is in line with an associative mechanism where CO2 adsorbs on γ-Al2O3 forming carbonate or bicarbonate, being rapidly hydrogenated to formate. Formate reduction is the rate-determining step, with all subsequent hydrogenation steps to CH4 being fast. The band intensity of *COads does not change, irrespective of position in the catalyst bed. This invariance of *COads can be interpreted in two ways. *COads could be a spectator species that is present at the catalyst surface but not involved in any kinetically relevant reaction channel. Alternatively, *COads could be formed by rapid dissociative adsorption of CO2 at the surface of the Ni nanoparticles with a high adsorption equilibrium constant, leading to an almost constant *COads coverage within the investigated CO2 conversion range. If the rate-determining step in the reaction sequence to CH4 would then occur after the formation of *COads, e.g., *COads → *Cads + *Oads or *COads + *Hads → *HCOads, an almost constant *COads signal would result as well.

Biosynthetic strategy of ferrous sulfide (FeS) through Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in bioelectrochemical systems has been extensively explored to maintain bettered electron transfer performance. In this study, the simultaneous FeS biosynthesis and CO2 reduction were conducted in the microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system, aiming at improving electron transfer efficiency as well as acetate production. It was shown that the FeS was successfully biomineralized and then loaded onto the sludge in the Fe3+/S2O32−/MR-1 group, of which the acetate accumulation increased by 87.50%, 64.63% and 33.66% than the control, MR-1 and Fe3+/S2O32− groups. Also, electrochemical performance revealed by the CV analysis was enhanced, whereas the increased EPS accumulation and intracellular electron transfer activity by the biosynthesized FeS could also be proved. Moreover, the biogenic FeS enriched the abundances of acetogenic and sulfur-utilizing species as Acetobacterium, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_13, Sulfuricurvum and Desulfovibrio. Meanwhile, strongly positive correlations between Shewanella, the sulfur utilizers and acetogens were confirmed in the Fe3+/S2O32−/MR-1 group. With improved electron transfer efficiency and the boosted acetate accumulation, the in-situ biogenic FeS might be promising for CO2 capture and utilization.

Production of C2 chemicals (such as C2H4, C2H5OH, etc.) from CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2ER) has been regarded as a promising route to solve the environmental problems and energy crisis. In this work, mesoporous Cu2O microspheres of ca. 700 nm diameter size with low crystallinity were fabricated to enable efficient conversion of CO2 to C2 chemicals by electrocatalytic reduction. It is revealed that compared with bulk Cu2O, the obtained mesoporous Cu2O microspheres have larger surface area, more grain boundaries and defects (unsaturated coordination sites), which facilitate the adsorption and stabilization of the important intermediates, such as *CO, on the route to C2 chemicals formation. As a result, the Faraday efficiency (FE) of C2 products reaches as high as 82.6 % and 78.5 % in an H-cell and a flow cell, respectively. In situ Raman and FT-IR spectra reveal that during CO2ER test there exists abundant *CO on the mesoporous Cu2O surface, thus increasing the opportunity of CC coupling. And the high coverage of *CO on catalyst surface during CO2ER protects and stabilizes the oxidation state of Cu species. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to introduce mesoporous structures and decreased crystallinity for improving the performance of CO2ER to C2 products.

Carbon-based materials with single-atom (SA) transition metals coordinated with nitrogen (M-Nx) have attracted extensive attention due to their superior electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance. However, the uncontrolled recombination of metal atoms during the typical high-temperature synthesis process in M-Nx causes deterioration of CO2RR activity. Herein, by using electrospinning, we propose a novel strategy for constructing a highly active and selective SA Fe-modified N-doped porous carbon fiber membrane catalyst (Fe-N-CF). This carbon membrane has an interconnected three-dimensional structure and a hierarchical porous structure, which can not only confine Fe to be single atom as active centers, but also provide a diffusion channel for CO2 molecules. Relying on its special structure and stable mechanical properties, Fe-N-CF is directly used for CO2RR, which presents an excellent selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 97%) and stability. DFT calculations reveals that the synthesized Fe-N4-C can significantly reduce the energy barrier for intermediate COOH* formation and CO desorption. This work highlights the specific advantages of using electrospinning method to prepare the optimal SA catalysts.

A method for the synthesis of γ‐amino sulfones through visible light‐induced oxidative decarboxylation and radical reductive addition is described. Various readily available N‐protected natural amino acids react with aromatic/aliphatic vinyl sulfones to directly produce γ‐amino sulfone derivatives. This reaction is also applicable to α‐N(O)‐acids and other aliphatic carboxylic acids, resulting in the corresponding sulfone derivatives. The method operates without the need for sacrificial reducing agents or additional hydrogen atom donors. The sole by‐product is CO2 released from decarboxylation, rendering the process both atom‐ and step‐economical.

Argania spinosa, commonly known as the Argan tree, assumes a crucial role in bolstering environmental sustainability by augmenting carbon storage in both biomass and soil. Despite its significant environmental contributions, there exists a conspicuous gap in scientific research and data pertaining to the carbon dynamics associated with Moroccan Argan forest ecosystems and their prized products, particularly Argan oil. To address this research gap, our study meticulously investigates the intricate details of the carbon footprint linked to Argan oil production within the "Argan Biosphere Reserve" in southern Morocco. This innovative research aims to deliver a comprehensive assessment of the carbon footprint within the Argan oil industry, conducting a thorough examination of 10 companies and 16 cooperatives actively involved in production. The foundation of this investigation rests on on-site interviews with leaders of production units, systematically gathering essential data for rigorous analysis. Employing the "Bilan Carbone" tool, we intricately calculated emissions, categorizing them into three scopes. The resulting carbon footprint outcomes were meticulously delineated across three distinct scenarios, shedding light on the nuanced dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions. In the first scenario, encompassing all scopes, including export-related emissions, companies displayed an average carbon footprint of approximately 10.17 kg CO2 eq.l-1, while cooperatives recorded 8.68 kg CO2 eq.l-1. The second scenario, excluding export-related emissions, unveiled companies with an average carbon footprint of 3.71 kg CO2-eq.l-1 and cooperatives with 6.32 kg CO2-eq.l-1. The third Scenario, concentrating solely on scopes 1 and 2, indicated companies with an average estimated carbon footprint of 1.31 kg CO2 eq.l-1, and cooperatives with approximately 3.01 kg CO2 eq.l-1. Delving deeper into the intricacies of emissions by scenario and oil-producing organizations, our findings underscore the substantial impact of electricity consumption on the overall carbon footprint of Argan oil. For companies, electricity consumption contributed between 10.84% (first scenario) and 66.97% (third scenario), while for cooperatives, the range was 26.97% (first scenario) to 75.57% (third scenario). To optimize the carbon footprint, our study recommends strategic interventions such as reducing electricity and butane consumption. Moreover, adopting sustainable practices, including leveraging photovoltaic electricity and synthetic gas from the pyrolysis of Argan byproducts, can significantly curtail the average carbon footprint of companies and cooperatives, charting a trajectory toward environmental sustainability. Specifically, a reduction of 37.05% and 40.75% (second scenario) and an impressive 71.66% and 77.01% (third scenario) for companies and cooperatives, respectively, could be achieved after a 30-year amortization period of photovoltaic panels. These findings not only contribute valuable insights into the environmental impact of Argan oil production but also pave the way for future in-depth studies and the formulation of sustainable pathways to optimize the carbon footprint of this critical industry.

Amorphous metal–organic frameworks (aMOFs) are highly attractive for electrocatalytic applications due to their exceptional conductivity and abundant defect sites, but harsh preparation conditions of "top-down" strategy have hindered their widespread use. Herein, the scalable production of aMIL-68(In)-NH2 was successfully achieved through a facile "bottom-up" strategy involving ligand competition with 2-methylimidazole. Multiple in situ and ex situ characterizations reveal that aMIL-68(In)-NH2 evolutes into In/In2O3–x as the genuine active sites during the CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2RR) process. Moreover, the retained amino groups could enhance the CO2 adsorption. As expected, the reconstructed catalyst demonstrates high formate Faradaic efficiency values (>90%) over a wide potential range of 800 mV in a flow cell, surpassing most top-ranking electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the abundant oxygen vacancies in aMIL-68(In)-NH2 induce more local charges around electroactive sites, thereby promoting the formation of HCOO* intermediates. Furthermore, 16 g of samples can be readily prepared in one batch and exhibit almost identical CO2RR performances. This work offers a feasible batch-scale strategy to design amorphous MOFs for the highly efficient electrolytic CO2RR.

Copper-based electrocatalysts, which hold great promise in selectively reducing CO2 into multicarbon products, have attracted a lot of recent interest, both experimentally and theoretically. While many studies have suggested a strong dependence of catalytic selectivity on the concentration of the *CO reaction intermediate on Cu surface, it remains challenging for a direct experimental probe of the CO coverage. This necessitates a reliable computational method that can accurately establish the theoretical coverage-dependent phase diagram of CO adsorbates on the catalyst. Here we propose a scheme composed of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, machine-learning force fields (MLFF) and graph neural networks (GNN) as a solution. This method enables a fast screening of 7 million adsorption configurations based on a small set of DFT data, with a balance between accuracy and efficiency tuned by the combinatorial use of MLFF and GNN models. We have investigated 8 different Cu facets, and discovered that the high-index facets such as (310), (210) and (322) exhibit a much higher CO coverage than the low-index counterparts such as (111), leading to an increased opportunity for C-C coupling for the former. Our results can provide a new perspective for the understanding of the fundamental role of CO coverage on Cu surface for electrochemical CO2 reduction.

Aircraft engines are a source of harmful non-volatile Particulate Matter (nvPM) emissions, negatively affecting human health and the global environment. To mitigate this, new sources of fuel are being assessed for the commercial aviation sector. Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) show significant promise as replacements to conventional aviation fuels, with the potential to reduce lifecycle CO2 and nvPM emissions because of lower aromatic contents and higher hydrogen content. Towards better understanding of the nvPM emissions from aircraft combustors operating with SAF, this work outlines results from the RAPTOR experimental test campaigns performed at Cardiff University’s Gas Turbine Research Centre (GTRC). Several aviation fuels of varying physiochemical properties were burned in a non-proprietary Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) combustor rig. The nvPM emissions were measured using the European nvPM reference system, with data corrected for particle loss in the sampling and measurement system using additional particle size measurement. nvPM emission reductions were achieved for fuels of higher hydrogen content, and system loss correction was required to accurately quantify those reductions. Additionally, independent control of the air supply to the combustor rig allowed the impact of fuel spray quality to be decoupled from AFR, demonstrating that small improvements in spray droplet atomisation predicted from benchmarking fuel spray experiments (~5% reduction in SMD) consistently yielded significant reductions in nvPM emissions, ranging from 5-72% for nvPM EImass, 11-89% for nvPM EInumber, and 1-7% for GMD.

Portland cement is widely used in the construction industry. Its production contributes to carbon dioxide emissions, urging the need for sustainable alternatives. The present study aims to evaluate the strength, durability, microstructural properties, and cost-effectivity of geopolymer (GP) concrete containing polyethylene (PE) fibers, with fly ash (FA), ground-granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and calcium magnesium carbonate (CaMg(CO3)2 known as dolomite) as binders. PE fiber used has an ultra-high molecular weight. Six different mixtures were produced with FA, GGBFS, dolomite, and/or PE fiber. The control mix used only FA as a binder without PE fiber. Fresh and mechanical properties, including slump value, compressive strength, and split tensile strength, were determined, and non-destructive tests, such as electrical resistivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity, were conducted. The durability of GP was evaluated through initial surface absorption and capillary suction absorption tests at different curing ages. Microstructural and mineralogical characteristics were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results revealed that the addition of PE fibers and CaMg(CO3)2 reduced the workability of GP by 30.22% in comparison with that of PE fiber along with GGBFS. Compared to the reference mix at 28 days, incorporating 20% GGBFS resulted in the highest improvement of 76.89% and 104.86% in compressive and split tensile strength, respectively. GP sample with 20% GGBFS replacement of FA presented the highest reduction of 44.4–41.63% for initial and secondary rate of absorption. SEM analysis showed that the addition of GGBFS and CaMg(CO3)2 to fiber-reinforced FA-based geopolymer mixes developed a denser and more homogenous matrix with improved mechanical behavior due to the co-existence of C−S−H and aluminosilicate gel. PE fibers improve the toughness properties by helping to absorb energy and bridging cracks. The development of a stronger matrix was characterized by C−S−H, calcium aluminate oxide (carbonate) hydroxide (C4AHx) and quartz. A one-way ANOVA analysis and cost analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of partially replacing FA with CaMg(CO3)2 and GGBFS in PE fiber-reinforced GP concrete.

Ground heat is a renewable energy source that is less affected by atmospheric temperature and maintains a nearly constant temperature throughout the year. Therefore, it can serve as a heat source for hot water and air conditioning systems, resulting in a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional systems. In Japan, the recognition of the use of ground heat is still low, and the prices of ground heat exchangers and geothermal heat pumps tend to be high. In addition, the excavation cost is very high, so it is very important to reduce the construction cost. One cost-saving method is to install a ground heat exchanger in the core material of the earth retaining wall, which has been shown to reduce construction costs by more than 50%. In this study, a numerical program was developed to clarify the performance and characteristics of a ground heat exchanger attached to an H-beam in a "Pre-installation method using the earth retaining wall". Then, the factors influencing the heat extraction performance of two U-Tube heat exchangers connected in series, four U-Tube heat exchangers connected in series and two W-Tube heat exchangers connected in series were investigated. Firstly, the validity of the calculation program was confirmed by comparing the numerical results with the experimental thermal response results. Secondly, numerical simulations were performed using the calculation program, and the following results were obtained. Under the conditions defined in this study, we found that the rate of heat extraction increases as the flow rate of the heat extraction medium increases in all ground heat exchangers. However, it becomes difficult to increase the heat extraction when the flow of the heat extraction medium reaches a turbulent area. All three models confirmed that the H-beam expanded the area where the formation temperature changes and increased the temperature of the heat extraction medium. This led to an enhanced heat extraction performance of the ground heat exchanger. Finally, we compared the heat extraction performance of several ground heat exchangers using the 'coefficient of heat extraction or rejection'. The results showed that the four U-Tube model had the highest performance, followed by the two W-Tube model, and the two U-Tube model had the lowest performance, although the differences were small.

The main objective of the present study was to compare the catalytic activity of selected limestones (Göynük, Dikmen, Polatlı Yolu, Kınık Tüneli and Köserelik) in terms of H2-rich syngas production from biomass gasification. In order to achieve this goal, an ASPEN plus-based model for biomass gasification integrated with carbonation reaction was developed. Tar formation was also considered and the gasification process was carried out based on Gibbs free energy minimization. A combined effect of temperature (600-710 °C), steam/biomass ratio, S/B (0.58-1.58), and limestone/biomass ratio, L/B (0-2.0) on gas composition, H2 yield (HY) and gas yield (GY) was also studied. An increase in both S/B and L/B was beneficial for H2 enrichment. The CO2 content declined sharply from 16.83 vol% to 10.28 vol% with increasing L/B from 0 to 1.5; however, a marginal reduction in CO2 content was observed with further increase in L/B. The highest HY (51.01 g/kg) was produced with Dikmen followed by Göynük, Polatlı Yolu, Kınık Tüneli and Köserelik. The results also showed that the limestone samples with high CaO content in general exhibits a better H2 production capacity than limestones with low CaO content. To the best of our knowledge, no simulation study has been presented to compare the catalytic activity of different limestones in terms of H2 production.

This paper presents a system modelling approach aimed at designing and simulating real-time conditions, with a specific focus on extreme scenarios to assess the impact on the annual CO2 emissions and the consumption of LNG and batteries in a hybrid tugboat. Environmental variables such as wave period, wave height, current speed, and wind speed are considered. The tugboat system model is validated using manually logged historical operational data from a similar tugboat profile using both AMESIM and MATLAB\Simulink to simulate diverse environmental conditions and estimate annual fuel operational costs and emissions. A comparative analysis of the different system configurations is then conducted between traditional diesel, LNG and several control configurations of LNG-battery hybrid. Results demonstrate a significant reduction of 96.5% in CO2 emissions and a 95.3% decrease in annual fuel operational costs with the adoption of LNG-battery hybrid propulsion with the rule-based control system. The study notes a slight increase in vessel operational time by 10.8% due to higher wave heights and a 0.97% rise in added resistance from increased wind speed. Insignificant differences are observed in variations of wave period and current speed. Additionally, the CII ratings of the different system configurations were then compared and concluded with the LNG-battery hybrid with a rule-based control system being the most environmentally and economically sustainable.

Abstract. New regulations of sulphur emissions from shipping were introduced in 2020, reducing emissions of SO2 from international shipping by ~80 %. As SO2 is an aerosol precursor, this drop in emission over the ocean will weaken the total aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) that historically has masked an uncertain fraction of the warming due to increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Here, we use four global climate models and a chemistry transport model to calculate the ERF due to an 80 % reduction in SO2 emissions from international shipping relative to 2019 emission estimates. The model means of the ERF range from 0.06 to 0.09 W m-2 corresponding to the ERF due to the increase in CO2 concentration over the last two to three years.

Knowledge of the thermal phenomena that occur during stamping is important for improving the design and performance of stamping die thermal structures. A new mathematical full-scale model for energy and carbon flows is established based on operational data from a cold stamping production line in China. Moreover, numerical simulations of the thermal-fluid–solid coupling field for a cooling medium in an asymmetrically heated rectangular channel with high heat flux and strong wall superheating are carried out with a suitable CFD solver. The results are discussed in detail and compared with theoretical calculations, and the deviation of the surface heat transfer coefficient is ± 11.9 %. Emphasis is placed on parametric effects of variables controlling thermal characteristics on cold stamping with an active cooling structure. The effects of heat flux, and ambient temperature on temperature rise, pressure drops, and heat transfer coefficients are limited less than 7 °C, 167 Pa and 45.11 % under specific operating conditions, respectively. While the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drops are increased hundreds of times with inlet velocity. The fluid cooling performance, threshold value, and approaches for heat transfer enhancement are obtained. Finally, the CO2 emissions rates is assessed as approximately 1.8 g per piece associated with stamping operations, as well as major contributors, CO2 reduction potential, and economic impacts. Negative energy consumption can be achieved with active cooling. These results can help to improve production quality in the future application and provide theoretical support for determining the causes of metal sheet tensile cracking accidents.

Improving ligand-to-active metal charge transfer (LAMCT) by finely tuning the organic ligand is a decisive strategy to enhance charge transfer in metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-based catalysts. However, in most MOFs loaded with active metal catalysts, electron transmission encounters massive obstacle at the interface between the two constituents owing to poor LAMCT. Herein, amines (–NH2) functionalized MOFs (NH2-MIL-101(Cr)) encapsulated active metal Pt nanoclusters (NCs) catalysts are synthesized by the polyol reduction method and utilized for the photoreduction of CO2. Surprisingly, the introduction of –NH2 (electron donating) groups within the matrix of MIL-101(Cr) improved the electron migration through the LAMCT process, fostering a synergistic interaction with Pt. The combined experimental analysis exposed the high number of metallic Pt (Pt0) in Pt@NH2-MIL-101(Cr) catalyst through seamless electron shuttling from N of –NH2 group to excited Pt generating versatile hybrid Pt-N catalytic centres. Consequently, these versatile hybrid catalytic centres act as electro-nucleophilic centres, which enable the efficient and selective conversion of CO bond in CO2 to harvest CH4 (131.0 µmol.g−1) and maintain excellent stability and selectivity for consecutive five rounds, superior to Pt@MIL-101(Cr) and most reported catalysts. Our study verified that the precise tuning of organic ligands in MOFs immensely improves the surface-active centres, electron migration, and catalytic selectivity of the excited Pt NCs catalysts encaged inside MOFs through an improved LAMCT pathway.

Currently, great importance is attached to the reduction of emissions in industrial production, especially in the production of cement, when it is indicated that during production 1 ton of cement produces approximately 0.6 ton of CO2. Reducing emissions is possible thanks to secondary raw materials, which are produced in large quantities in the Czech Republic volumes for which a suitable use is sought. Some secondary raw materials are suitable for use in concrete mixes, which are used to improve the rheology of the fresh concrete mixture as well as the properties hardened concrete. Currently, there is an effort to eliminate the production of cement, to which its partial replacement by admixtures could also contribute. Therefore it is necessary determine the optimal admixture that could be used to replace part of the cement in concrete mix. A large consumer of concrete mixes are transport structures, where it is possible for some of the cement used to be replaced by an admixture.

Microwave heating (MWH) of lignocellulosic biomass with susceptors has attracted attention for H2 production. In this study, H2 is produced from cellulose via MWH at 800 °C in a steam atmosphere with magnetite used as the susceptor. The effects of steam feeding and MWH on the product yields are experimentally investigated in comparison with conventional heating (CH). The H2 and CO2 yields are increased by steam feeding for both MWH and CH because the water–gas shift reaction occurs. Without steam feeding, MWH enhances H2 and CO production, thereby increasing the maximum energy efficiency. With steam feeding, the steam gasification of C is more predominant for CH than for MWH as the reduction in the C content in the char of CH is higher than that of MWH. MWH reduces the formation of secondary char, and it is therefore expected to overcome issues such as the clogging or blockage of gas lines.

Policies for reducing the environmental impact of light-duty vehicles are restarting in Brazil. While electrification attracts more engagement than other forms of carbon footprint reduction, the use of ethanol could achieve faster gains with the existing infrastructure. The prominence of entry-level cars has reduced, which may be due to several factors, making these vehicles uneconomical for manufacturers to produce. This situation is different from those in other countries. It is our premise that other modes, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, are the main methods of decarbonization. However, most need improvements in terms of security and attractiveness for consumers. Hence, the internal combustion engine will dominate the Brazilian fleet for quite some time. This article discusses the policies used to incentivize the implementation of entry-level vehicles in contrast with electric vehicles based on regression models of the Brazilian fleet. By providing a history of the 1.0 L engine in Brazil, this article debates replacing the indirect displacement taxation with direct CO2 taxation, which can make the Brazilian entry-level car practical again, with the possibility of adopting some incentives. This logic will cause a fleet renovation and more rational energy use. The distinguishing feature of this article is the proposition of possible public policies based on a regression model of the national fleet. The key findings show that the fleet is getting older and heavier, consuming more energy, and emitting greater amounts of CO2 per unit of displacement, for example, 1.0 L. Furthermore, the carbon footprint of the electricity mix is similar to that of the produced ethanol (from well to wheel, the carbon footprint is the same). This highlights the necessity for national policy adjustments and effective public policies to reduce carbon emissions from the energy sector for small vehicles.

The goal of increasing fuel efficiency and decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has increased interest in the application of renewable energy sources and the usage of new technologies in the maritime industry. In order to implement the most suitable source, factors such as voyage duration, storage availability, and the condition of existing vessels as well as those that are still under construction should be taken into account. Propeller optimization is proposed as a long-term solution. This paper investigates the environmental aspects of propeller optimization, focusing on its potential to reduce ship vibrations fuel consumption, and, therefore, the ship’s carbon footprint. The case study presents propeller optimization on a Ro-Ro passenger ship. The data collected during sea trials before and after propeller optimization will be compared. Expected fuel oil consumption will be correlated to the CO2 emission reduction. Besides propeller optimization, the paper performs a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis comparing it with solar and wind power applications on ships.

With the acceleration of the green and low-carbon transformation of the power system, it is very important to calculate and analyze the carbon emissions of the urban power system. In order to effectively grasp the carbon emission distribution of power system and reduce the carbon emission of power system, this paper proposes a systematic carbon emission measurement method for regional power system. Firstly, the quantitative analysis model of driving factors for regional power system carbon emissions is constructed, and the direction and measures of low-carbon transformation and green collaborative development of regional power system are proposed. Secondly, energy consumption scenarios under different constraints are established to support the collaborative control path of CO2. It provides key data and a theoretical basis for the low-carbon development of the power industry. Finally, a systematic carbon emission measurement method based on LSTM-Attention is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by an example analysis, and the effective path of carbon emission reduction in the future is analyzed.

Background: Delivery of oxygen-rich gas (hyperoxia) is used to treat medical emergencies as well as to prevent adverse outcomes in certain occupations that are subjected to extreme environmental conditions. While useful for mitigating acute health risks, hyperoxia has been linked to health decrements including systemic vasoconstriction, increased oxidative stress, worsened neurological outcomes, and increased mortality. Notably, hyperoxia has been found to decrease global cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans by as much as 37%. Reductions in CBF are associated with increased risk of stroke and cognitive impairment- both of which present heterogeneously. To our knowledge, only one study has explored hyperoxia’s effect on regional CBF and there appeared to be a differential response between regions, but no between-region analysis was performed. If a differential response between regions can be identified, these regions could be monitored more closely for signs of dysfunction or dysregulation. We hypothesized that brain lobes and regions will exhibit a non-uniform reduction in CBF when given 100% oxygen (O 2 ). Methods: Healthy, young adults (n= 15; 7 F; 22 ± 4 yr; BMI: 22 ± 2) were studied after an 8-hour fast and 24-hour abstinence from caffeine, exercise, or alcohol. Women were studied on days 1-5 of their menstrual cycle and not taking any hormonal contraception. Subjects completed a single magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, 3 Tesla) visit. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI quantified microvascular CBF in six lobes and their 71 subregions during normoxia and again after ~10 min steady-state hyperoxia. Hyperoxia was achieved by breathing 100% O 2 with supplemental carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to maintain end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ). The CAT12 toolbox extension for Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) was used to process ASL data. CBF (mL/100g/min) was analyzed as absolute change (Δ), and relative change (%Δ). Two-factor and one-factor repeated measures ANOVA were performed to detect significant main effects and region-condition interactions. A Tukey test was used for post-hoc analysis and pairwise comparisons. Significance was set to P≤0.05. Results: Results are mean ± SD. Heart rate (HR) and ETCO 2 remained similar from normoxia to hyperoxia, but mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased by 5 ± 6 mmHg ( P=0.013). Hyperoxia reduced CBF in all anatomical lobes (Occipital; Parietal; Frontal; Temporal; Brainstem/Cerebellum; Subcortical [ P≤0.001]), but the relative decrease was not different between lobes ( P=0.522; range= 18 ± 12% to 21 ± 9%). When examining CBF between 71 smaller brain regions, hyperoxia reduced blood flow in all regions ( P≤0.001; range= 15 ± 13% to 25 ± 13%); ANOVA indicated a region-specific effect ( P≤0.001), however post-hoc analysis did not identify which regions displayed different levels of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Conclusion: These are the first data to systematically examine the regional effects of hyperoxia on CBF. Contrary to our hypothesis, the microvascular CBF reduction to hyperoxia appears uniform across anatomical brain lobes. However, regional analysis indicated that there may be a differential microvascular vasoconstrictor response to hyperoxia between some functional regions of the brain. Funding: NIH R01 HL150361.

This study investigates the environmental and mechanical implications of incorporating silica fume into lime-activated thermo-mechanically treated waste concrete powder (TMWCP) to develop a sustainable clinker-free binder. The novel activation method involves thermo-mechanical treatment of WCP, followed by lime and calcium formate chemical activation. The results demonstrated that incorporating silica fume enhanced the pozzolanic reactivity, which led to the formation of C-S-H, pore refinement, and a dramatic increase in compressive strength. For instance, the incorporation of 20% and 25% silica fume exhibited compressive strength of 46 MPa and 43 MPa after 28 days of curing. The developed clinker-free binder with the addition of 20% silica fume demonstrated a reduction in mineral resource consumption of 99.3% and CO2 emissions of 13% and 69.3% compared to the sample without silica fume and ordinary Portland cement, respectively. This study offers a promising avenue for the widespread utilization of WCP as an environmentally friendly clinker-free binder.

The importance and breadth of applications of the family of quaternary chalcogenides with the formula Cu2ZnSnSxSe(4−x) (CZTS/Se) where x = 0–4 are steadily expanding due to the tunable optoelectronic properties of these compounds and the Earth abundance of the elements in their composition. These p-type semiconductors are viewed as a viable alternative to Si, gallium arsenide, CdTe, and CIGS solar cells due to their cost effectiveness, Earth’s crust abundance, and non-toxic elements. Additionally, CZTS/Se compounds have demonstrated notable capabilities beyond solar cells, such as photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction, solar water splitting, solar seawater desalination, hydrogen production, and use as an antibacterial agent. Various routes have been explored for synthesizing pure CZTS/Se nanomaterials and significant efforts have been dedicated to reducing the occurrence of secondary phases. This review focuses on synthetic approaches for CZTS/Se nanomaterials, with emphasis on controlling the size and morphology of the nanoparticles and their recent application in solar energy harvesting and beyond, highlighting challenges in achieving the desired purity required in all these applications.

This study aims to investigate the blends of supplementary cementitious ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) with limestone powder (LSP) as mineral admixtures to partially replace cement (up to 30%) in self-consolidating paste (SCP) systems made at respective water demands. Besides the control formulation (100% cement), the first set of SCP systems includes GGBFS alone as a partial substitute of cement (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), whereas the second set contains blends of 10% GGBFS with 10% and 20% LSP. For all the seven formulations (1 control, 4 binary and 2 ternary), tests were performed to determine their water demand, setting times and flow behavior, hydration kinetics, mechanical strengths and microstructural properties. Results showed that the fresh and hardened state properties of SCP systems incorporating GGBFS and LSP led to an increase in strength, hydration kinetics were slightly improved and hence enhancement of strength and microstructure of SCP systems. Reduction in initial and final setting times recorded with increased LSP from 10% to 20% in ternary SCP formulations. Early compressive strength due to LSP increased in ternary SCP systems as compared to binary formulations, which reflected synergy between GGBFS and LSP in SCP systems. Moreover, environmental assessment results indicate a significant reduction in CO2 emissions by substituting cement with GGBFS and LSP. These findings indicate that both GGBFS and LSP can be successfully used in developing high performance and environment friendly self-compacting concrete (SCC).

The study aimed to test the hypothesis that biochar's unique properties, such as its microporous structure, enhance concrete's resilience to high temperatures. Despite expectations of reduced crack formation and enhanced fire resistance, the experimental results revealed limited impact on concrete's fire behaviour. The investigation involved the use of two biochar types, fine and coarse biochar as replacements for cement and aggregates, respectively. Fine biochar exhibited higher water absorption and Young's modulus than coarse biochar, but both resisted ignition at 35 kW/m2 and had peak heat release rates below 40 kW/m2. Incorporating these biochars at varying weight percentages (5, 10, and 20 wt.%) into concrete led to a gradual decline in compressive and tensile strength due to reduced binding ability with increased biochar content. Exposure to 1000 °C compromised mechanical properties across all the samples. However, the biochar concrete maintained standard compressive strength (compared to the control) with up to 20 wt.% biochar as a fine aggregate substitute after exposure to 600°C, and as a cement replacement after exposure to 200°C. This substitution also yielded a significant reduction in CO2 emissions (50 % reduction as the biochar loading amount doubled) from concrete manufacturing, showcasing biochar's potential for sustainable construction practices. Despite not fully supporting the initial hypothesis, the study demonstrated biochar's viability in reducing carbon footprint while maintaining concrete strength under certain fire conditions.

To investigate the decoupling relationship between inland ship emissions and regional socioeconomic development in the Yangtze River Basin, this study constructed an emissions inventory for inland ships from 2007 to 2022, based on inland shipping freight statistics and ship carbon pollution emission intensity. Additionally, the Petri-Tapio decoupling model was employed to analyze the relationship between ship carbon pollution emissions and per capita GDP. The study concluded that CO2 emissions from inland ships in the Yangtze River Basin increased from 2.418 million tons in 2007 to 10.801 million tons in 2022. In 2021, the emissions of NOx and SOx from inland ships in the Yangtze River Basin accounted for 2.27% and 0.0021%, respectively, of China's anthropogenic emissions. Despite a year-on-year increasing trend in ship emissions within the basin, significant reductions in PM and SO2 emissions were observed post-2018 due to the implementation of emission reduction policies. Furthermore, we found that economically developed areas such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had higher emissions compared to other regions, with regional ship emissions positively correlating with the level of economic activity. Decoupling analysis results indicated that most provinces in the Yangtze River Basin have not effectively decoupled ship carbon pollution emissions from GDP growth. The findings of this study provide support for the Chinese government to formulate stricter ship emission control policies while promoting the growth of the Yangtze River shipping economy.

Purpose – Find optimal flight and design parameters for three objectives: minimum fuel consumption, Direct Operating Costs (DOC), and environmental impact of a passenger jet aircraft. --- Approach – Combining multiple models (this includes aerodynamics, specific fuel consumption, DOC, and equivalent CO2 mass) into one generic model. In this combined model, each objective's importance is determined by a weighting factor. Additionally, the possibility of further optimizing this model by altering an aircraft's wing loading is analyzed. --- Findings – When optimizing for a compromise between economic and ecologic benefits, the general outcome is a reduction in cruise altitude and an unaltered cruise Mach number compared to common practice. Decreasing cruise speed would benefit the environmental impact but has a negative effect on seat-mile cost. An increase in wing loading could further optimize the general outcome. Albeit at the cost of a greater required landing distance, therefore limiting the operational opportunities of this aircraft. --- Research limitations – Most models use estimating equations based on first principles and statistical data. --- Practical implications – The optimal cruise altitude and speed for a specific objective can be approximated for any passenger jet aircraft. --- Social implications – By using a simple approach, the discussion of optimizing aircraft opens up to a level where everyone can participate. --- Value – To find a general answer on how to optimize aviation, operational and design-wise, by using a simple approach.

An integrated energy system (IES) plays a key role in transforming energy consumption patterns and solving serious environmental and economic problems. However, the abundant optional schemes and the complex coupling relationship among each piece of equipment make the optimization of an IES very complicated, and most of the current literature focuses on optimization of a specific system. In this work, a simulation-based two-step decoupling method is proposed to simplify the optimization of an IES. The generalized IES is split into four subsystems, and a two-layer optimization method is applied for optimization of the capacity of each piece of equipment. The proposed method enables fast comparison among abundant optional configurations of an IES, and it is applied to a hospital in Beijing, China. The optimized coupling system includes the gas-fired trigeneration system, the GSHP, and the electric chiller. Compared with the traditional distributed systems, the emission reduction rate of CO2 and NOX for the coupling system reaches 153.8% and 314.5%, respectively. Moreover, the primary energy consumption of the coupling system is 82.67% less than that of the traditional distributed energy system, while the annual cost is almost at the same level.    

    

## Can We Reverse Global Warming?

Without mitigation, Climate Change is expected to costs large amounts of money, cause vast amounts of human suffering and death and threatens the survival of countless species. Rising global temperatures alone are expected to cause a drop in GDP of 30 – 70% for many countries with already high temperatures. In combination with other factors (population growth, increasing water stress, coastal flooding, loss of coastal land, increasing forest fires, loss of wildlife areas and insufficient wild-life corridors), Climate Change could lead to a collapse in ecosystem services, estimated at almost twice the global GDP. For humans, these combined factors would increase poverty, famine, starvation and cause mass migration. Under the Paris Accord, countries agreed to limit Climate Change to 1.5 degrees. This limit was not set because it was a “safe” for biodiversity or humanity, but because lower limits were considered “unachievable”. However, a relatively quick reversal of global warming would minimize all damages that would occur over the next centuries under Climate Change. Besides the return to pre-industrial atmospheric conditions, minimizing loss of human lives and minimizing damage to wildlife areas and the biodiversity these represent, this would also allow a gradual restoration of mountain snow and ice caps, restoring melt water flows, reduce water stress and minimize coastal flooding. Governments treat the changes needed to transition to a carbon neutral world as “costs” instead of “investments”. Here I show how the use of renewable energy (especially roof PV solar), ground source heat pumps and electric cars combined with massive application of direct air capture and sequestration of CO2 (DACCS) can reverse global warming in 40 to 60 years while saving massive amounts of money (about 3.62% of GDP). A critical element in doing this is the use of the Impacts Measurement and Conservation System (IMACS) as the business model. The IMAC system puts consumers, retailers and organizations in general in charge of selling and buying incrementally less damaging and more sustainable products and services, while being rewarded for their actions. Under IMACS, current and historic damaging impacts are calculated and assigned to participating products, services and individual labor. For participating sellers, damaging impacts and associated sustainabilities are accurately calculated per product and service per sales location (and daily adjusted) using automated and low costs methods. For non-participating competitor products, the impacts cannot be calculated accurately and are set to the statistic upper damage limit for each damage type for the product group. Sellers who start participation will therefore almost always see large reductions in damaging impacts and large increases in reported sustainabilities for their products and services. This could dramatically accelerate the rate of change towards a sustainable world. Participation in IMACS is voluntary and cost-free for individuals. In order for products to become (more) sustainable, damaging impacts like greenhouse gas emissions must be eliminated or must be offset by CO2 sequestered in permanent storage locations. For the society as a whole, becoming carbon neutral saves large amounts of money compared to not doing so, even when the costs of CO2 sequestration are included. Under IMACS, the purchase of neutralizing amounts of sequestered CO2 are paid for during the product purchase with an electronic voucher provided by the retailer. This only applies to participating products and services sold by participating retailers to participating customers. For a 40-year global warming reversal period, the average DACCS costs for the base and conservative DACCS cost scenarios are respectively 0.65 – 1.78% of GDP, but drop to 0.26 – 0.73% of GDP over 100 years. For carbon neutral sellers, the average DACCS costs (neutralizing historic emissions) are 0.92 – 2.56% of sale, but reach 1.58 – 4.39% of sale for the peak year. The ratio of cumulative energy cost savings over cumulative DACCS costs for a 40-year global warming reversal are 1.6 - 4.4 over the 40-year period and 4.5 – 12.4 over 100-year. Early participating sellers will receive all or most of these savings. Since under IMACS, the saving from carbon neutral operations throughout the supply chain go hand in hand with the DACCS payments for remaining and historical CO2 emissions, the DACCS costs can be paid out of the savings from carbon neutral operations. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the DACCS industry, as needed to reverse global warming, is in line with the currently expected CAGR for the DACCS industry between 2023 and 2032 (42 – 70% on production basis). A 63% growth rate under default model conditions maintained for 26 years would lead to global warming reversal in model year 41. By participating in IMACS, individuals and organizations can eliminate current CO2 emissions, neutralize historic CO2 emissions, save money and improve their competitive position. Becoming sustainable can be simplified from a political to a marketing challenge. IMACS, by assigning the costs of conservation (protection and restoration) to individuals and organizations responsible for the damage done, can effectively address and solve the classic “tragedy of the commons”.

Remote sensing imagery and machine learning algorithms are increasingly applied to quantify vegetation characteristics such as biomass and carbon density owing to the recent growing availability of satellite data and cloud-based computing technologies. In this study, we employ machine learning models on multispectral band reflectance data extracted from Landsat 8 satellite imagery, along with seven vegetation indices, to estimate the above-ground biomass (AGB) of a dry afromontane forest in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. We apply several Machine learning algorithms including Light Gradient Boosting (LightGB), Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to accurately estimate the AGB of the Desa'a dry afromontane forest and evaluate the performance of the models. In doing so, we divided the training dataset into five sections with the K-fold cross-validation (K-fold CV) technique and selected the optimal subset of features for each estimator. The efficiency of the models was then evaluated and compared based on metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and cross-validated root mean square error (CV-RMSE). Hyperparameter tuning in ensemble models significantly enhances predictive performances. Notably, RF, LightGB, and XGB with hyperparameter tuning lowers the RMSE values and exhibited superior predictive capabilities compared to regular gradient boosting model, which suffers from overfitting. In addition, regularization techniques are implemented on regression-based machine learning models to identify robust patterns in the data, prevent overfitting, and improve the generalization capabilities of the models in the estimation. The research findings are crucial for programs like REDD+ and other carbon markets, relying on accurate monitoring for tropical forest-based CO2 emissions reduction or increased removals of atmospheric CO2. This is particularly true in developing countries where financial constraints and security impediments limit the feasibility of field surveys and data collection.

Objective: Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is an established surrogate of hypergravity to investigate responses to central hypovolemia, including the reduction in cerebral blood flow. Increased inspired carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) causes cerebrovascular dilation and increases cerebral blood flow. We aimed to determine whether breathing 5% CO 2 for 1 minute increased cerebral blood flow during LBNP. We hypothesized 5% inspired CO 2 would increase cerebral blood flow during LBNP. Methods: We collected data from 15 (9 M/6 F, 31±8 yr, 25.6±3.2 kg/m 2 ) healthy individuals. Subjects breathed room air or a mix of 5% CO 2 , 21% oxygen, balance nitrogen gas for 1 minute prior to initiation of 2 minutes of -60 mmHg LBNP and throughout the duration of LBNP. We allowed a 2-minute wash-out between trials. We measured middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) with transcranial Doppler ultrasound and continuous, non-invasive blood pressure (MAP) with a finger plethysmograph. We corrected MCAv for MAP and present it as cerebrovascular conductance index (CVCi). We also measure ventilation and gas exchange with a pneumotachometer and gas analyzer. Results: All measured variables were similar prior to the initiation of room air and 5% CO 2 prebreathe ( p > 0.05). Inspired (1±1 vs. 36±1 mmHg) and end-tidal (38±4 vs. 47±3 mmHg) CO 2 were greater during the 5% inspired CO 2 trial ( p < 0.05, main effect of gas). LBNP caused an increase in heart rate, decrease in stroke volume, decrease in cardiac output, and an increase in total peripheral resistance ( p < 0.05, main effect of LBNP). These variables were similar regardless of inspiratory gas. MCAv (40±16 vs. 53±19 cm/s), MAP (94±10 vs. 99±11 mmHg), and CVCi (0.46±0.22 vs 0.56±0.24 cm/s/mmHg) were all greater during the 5% inspired CO 2 trials ( p < 0.05, main effect of gas). Discussion: Breathing a mixture of 5% CO 2 for 1 minute increased cerebral blood flow and blood pressure during a mimic of hypergravity stress. Despite technical challenges of integration into high-performance aircraft, increasing inspired CO 2 could contribute to better tolerance to hypergravity stress.

Abstract Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances, and existing HCFC emission studies lacked a comprehensive study of multiple HCFCs in a single consumption sector. China is a large producer and consumer of HCFCs. The HCFC bank in foam sector in 2019 accounted for 91.3% of the national total, and foam sector was also the second largest source of HCFC emissions. Therefore, the estimation of HCFC emissions and banks for the foam sector is quite important. In this study, the multiple HCFCs emission inventory for foam sector in eastern China from 2000 to 2019 was firstly established by using the bottom-up method. The results showed that the HCFC emissions and bank were 14.9 Kt and 453.5 Kt in 2019. HCFC-141b used in polyurethane (PU) foam sector had the largest annual emissions, cumulative emissions and bank due to its high consumption. The total emissions of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b used in extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam sector were similar with those of HCFC-141b. The HCFC emissions from the foam sector were mainly distributed among the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong. The cumulative GWP- and ODP-weighted emissions of HCFCs were 240.6 Mt CO2-eq and 14.3 Kt CFC-11-eq, respectively. So in order to response to climate change or ozone depletion, we should prioritize the emission reduction of HCFC-22 and XPS foam sector, or HCFC-141b and PU foam sector. And in order to jointly response to the two scientific questions, effective emission reductions of the above HCFCs and foam sectors are crucial.&#xD;

Employing density functional theory, we delved into the comprehensive pathways for methane oxidation on the Pd single atom supported with CeO2(111) encompassing sequential methane dehydrogenation, O2 dissociation, and oxidation processes. The introduction of a Pd atom into CeO2(111) led to a reduction in the barrier for CH4 dissociation to 0.50 eV. The methane dehydrogenation proceeded through a series of reactions: CH4 → CH3 → CH2 → CH → C, with all dehydrogenation steps being exothermic except the CH3 → CH2 step. The O2 dissociation reaction (O2 → O* + O*) is thermodynamically exothermic, with a dissociation barrier of 2.12 eV over Pd@CeO2. Subsequently, the generation of CO2 via the C* + O* and CO* + O* reactions is characterized by thermodynamically exothermic processes, with reaction energies of −1.20 and −1.01 eV, respectively. On the other hand, water production occurs through O* + H (an exothermic reaction) and OH* + H (an endothermic reaction) with reaction energies of −0.80 and +0.64 eV, respectively. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential pathways for single-atom catalysis involving transition metals supported on CeO2(111) in methane oxidation for industrial application.

Carbon-supported silver catalysts have proven high activity and durability in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. This work investigates the impact of cathode catalyst layer composition on performance by varying the ionomer content and Ag/C catalysts with differing BET surface areas (33–455 m2 g–1). For optimal performance, there is a positive correlation between optimal ionomer binder content and catalyst surface area: 5 wt % PiperION for Ag/CSuper P, 15 wt % PiperION for Ag/CVulcan, and 25 wt % PiperION for Ag/CKetjen. The top-performing cells exhibited remarkably high CO faradaic efficiencies of 93% for 15 wt % Ag/CVulcan, 91% for 5 wt % Piperion Ag/CSuper P, and 90% for 25 wt % Piperion Ag/CKetjen (all at 400 mA cm–2 with 0.01 M CsOH as anolyte). Long-term measurements at 300 mA cm–2 over 100 h revealed the lowest FECO loss for Ag/CVulcan, decreasing from 93 to 87%, followed by Ag/CSuper P (91–79%) and Ag/CKetjen (90–63%).

The transportation sector is regarded as the main culprit in greenhouse gas emission in the urban network, particularly idling vehicles waiting at signalized intersections. Although autonomous vehicles can be a promising technology to tackle vehicle idling, their environmental benefits receive little attention compared with their safety and mobility issues. This study investigated the environmental benefits of autonomous vehicles equipped with an automatic idling control function based on the queue discharge time and traffic signal information transmitted from the traffic signal controller via V2I communication using microscopic mobility and emission simulation models, VISSIM and MOVES, in Haeundae-gu in Busan, Korea. This study found that the function contributes to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions by 23.6% for all-inclusive emission and 94.3% for idling emission, respectively. Moreover, total reduced idling time accounts for 47.6% of the total travel time and 94.3% of the total idling time, respectively. Consequently, the autonomous vehicles equipped with automatic vehicle idling control function under C-ITS can play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption as well in the urban network.

Sustainable design and building information modeling have introduced challenges and opportunities to improve the efficiency of construction project management. The use of circular economy principles provides an opportunity to improve not only environmental indicators but also economic ones. This study addresses sustainable design and BIM in construction project management through circular economy principles. It aims to analyze the impact of using building information modeling on sustainability indicators measured through costs. For research purposes, the basic parameters of sustainability in the construction industry were defined as recycling rate and reductions in waste and CO2. The research questionnaire sample consisted of 199 respondents from Slovakia, Slovenia, and Croatia. Data were processed and evaluated through descriptive statistics, and then tests were used for data distribution. Statistical significance was determined through ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Pearson’s correlation analysis was used for data processing. The trends in the research results suggest that sustainable design can be achieved using building information modeling. They also pointed to an impact on sustainability through increasing the recycling rate and reducing the amount of waste. Although these results indicated a trend, this was not confirmed by the statistical significance tests.

Waste heat recovery from exhaust gas is one of the most convenient methods to save energy in internal combustion engine-driven vehicles. This paper aims to investigate a reduction in waste heat from the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine of a serial Diesel–electric hybrid bus by recovering part of the heat and converting it into useful power with the help of a split-flow supercritical CO2 (sCO2) recompression Brayton cycle. It can recover 17.01 kW of the total 33.47 kW of waste heat contained in exhaust gas from a 151 kW internal combustion engine. The thermal efficiency of the cycle is 38.51%, and the net power of the cycle is 6.55 kW. The variation in the sCO2 temperature at the shutdown of the internal combustion engine is analyzed, and a slow drop followed by a sudden and then a slow drop is observed. After 80 s from stopping the engine, the temperature drops by (23–33)% depending on the tube thickness of the recovery heat exchanger. The performances (net power, thermal efficiency, and waste heat recovery efficiency) of the split-flow sCO2 recompression Brayton cycle are clearly superior to those of the steam Rankine cycle and the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with cyclopentane as a working fluid.    

    

## Stubble Burning: Its Impact on the Ecosystem

Stubble burning has emerged as a leading cause of deteriorating air and soil quality, especially in South Asia and particularly in Indo-gangetic plains of Northern India. This is mainly attributed to the intense rice - wheat rotation system of farming, which generates large amounts of stubble. The practice of stubble burning is a source of gaseous pollutants such as CO2, CO, Nitrous oxides, Sulphur oxides and methane, as well as particulate matter (PM10 & PM 2.5), causing serious damage to human health and the environment. Human health gets globally affected in varying severity. The organ systems mainly affected are respiratory and cardiovascular. Beside these, ailments affecting skin, eyes are also observed. The respiratory system ailments include Asthma, COPD, Allergic Bronchitis, Emphysema and Interstitial Lung diseases. Long-term exposure to pollutants can cause reduction in life expectancy. Burning of the stubble in the fields, destroys the nutrient value of the soil. The heat generated from stubble burning penetrates into the soil down to earth elevating the temperature to 33.8 to 42.5 degrees Celsius. This kills the useful bacteria and fungal populations critical for a fertile soil. Burning of crop residue causes damage to microbes present in the upper layer of soil, as well as in the organic quality.

The creation of active material for chemiresistive gas sensors with high selectivity and sensitivity will allow a step towards miniaturization and reduction of power consumption of portable gas sensors. Graphene is a promising platform for the synthesis of two-dimensional active materials with high sensitivity. In this work, applying density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the effect of oxygen-containing functional groups (O, OH, O, COOH) on the adsorption of small gas molecules (NH3, CO2, CO, H2S, NO2, SO2) was rigorously studied. Based on the adsorption energies and partial charges from DFT calculations, the sensitivity and selectivity of graphene with different functionalizations were predicted. It was found that hydroxyl and carboxyl groups demonstrate increased selectivity and sensitivity of gas sensors, and the edge of graphene with hydroxyl groups shows the highest enhancement. Graphene with a carbonyl group was found to undergo irreversible chemisorption of NO2, which can potentially cause active material degradation, limiting the recyclability of gas sensors. Most of the molecules show both donor and acceptor behavior, which highlights the importance of a thorough selection of specific functional group types. The obtained results are useful for the rational design of graphene-based active material with oxygen-containing functional groups for chemiresistive gas sensors.

ABSTRACT Considering groundwater from the aquifers overlying the bedrock is an important water source for drinking purposes. As such, the investigation of its property is essential. Based on the spatial structure of aquifers in the study area, the aquifers in the Cenozoic strata are divided into three groups. The multivariate statistical approaches are employed to identify the hydrogeochemical processes and hydro-chemical types, and hydrogeochemical inverse modeling is applied to further validate and elucidate the hydrogeochemical process and water–rock interaction. The results are as follows: (1) The hydro-chemical type of the upper aquifer is dominated by the K + Na-HCO3 type, while others have similar water quality types, which are dominated by the K + Na-Cl type and the K + Na-SO4 type. (2) The saturation index of anhydrite, gypsum, halite, and CO2(g) is below zero in three aquifers, indicating that they are unsaturated. While aragonite, calcite, and dolomite in the middle aquifer remain in the unsaturated–saturated state. (3) The cation exchange process accelerating the reduction of Ca2+ concentration and the increase of SO42− concentration occurs in three aquifers, and the dissolution of calcite and dolomite minerals occurs in most cases. This study supports the fundamental evidence for the hydrogeochemical processes and water resource utilization and has a certain practical significance.

The efficient acetate conversion from CO electroreduction is challenging due to the poor selectivity at high reaction rate, which requires the competition with H2 and other C2+ (i.e., ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol) reduction products. Electrolyte engineering is one of the efficient strategies to regulate the reaction microenvironment. In this work, the adding of sulfite (SO32-) with high nucleophilicity in KOH electrolytes was demonstrated to enable improving the CO-to-acetate conversion via generating a S-O chemical bond between SO32- and oxygenated *C2 intermediates (i.e., *CO-CO, *CO-COH) compared with that in pure KOH system on both synthesized Cu(200)- and normal commercial Cu(111)-facets-exposed metallic Cu catalysts. As a result, the prepared Cu(200)-facets-exposed metallic Cu catalyst with surface ions modification showed an superior Faradaic efficiency of 63.6% at -0.6 A·cm-2, and extraordinary absolute value of peak partial current density as high as 1.52 A·cm-2 with adding SO32- in KOH electrolytes, compared to the best reported values in both CO and CO2 electroreduction. Our work suggests an attractive strategy to introduce the oxyanion with high nucleophilicity in electrolytes to regulate the microenvironment for industrial-current-density electrosynthesis of acetate from CO electroreduction.

Background: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a chronic form of orthostatic intolerance that significantly impacts the quality of life and day-to-day functioning of patients. POTS has an estimated prevalence of about 1%, predominantly affecting females of child-bearing age. POTS is characterized by an upright increase in heart rate (HR) of ≥30 bpm, without a drop in blood pressure. POTS is associated with chronic (≥ 3 months) upright symptoms including light-headedness, blurred vision, and cognitive dysfunction. A large proportion of POTS patients also experience hyperventilation when upright. Hyperventilation reduces arterial carbon dioxide (CO 2 ; hypocapnia) and exacerbates tachycardia in POTS. Whether the HR response is due to increased tidal volume (V T ) per se or the resulting hypocapnia is unclear. Investigating the independent effects of increased V T versus hypocapnia on HR might identify possible therapeutic targets to reduce HR in patients with POTS. Objective: We aimed to characterize the separate effects of hypocapnia and V T on HR in POTS patients. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that hypocapnia and V T will independently increase HR, with hypocapnia causing the greatest increase in HR in patients with POTS. Methods: Twenty female POTS patients (32±10 years) completed supine normocapnic and hypocapnic breathing tests. To assess the effects of hypocapnia on HR, we compared hypocapnic-hyperventilation versus normocapnic-hyperventilation with constant V T . To assess the effects of V T on HR, we compared increased V T breathing versus normal breathing with constant end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ). Breath-by-breath respiratory (V T , ETCO 2 ) and beat-to-beat hemodynamic parameters (stroke volume [SV], HR) were continuously measured. Data were analyzed with paired t-tests, and are reported as mean ± SD. Results: ETCO 2 was lower ( p<0.001) with similar V T during hypocapnia compared to normocapnia. Hypocapnia reduced SV (63.3±11.8 mL vs. 72.4±12.3 mL; p<0.001), and increased HR (99±13 bpm vs. 81±9 bpm; p<0.001). Compared to normal breathing, increased V T ( p<0.001) with constant ETCO 2 led to a smaller reduction in SV (72.4±12.3 mL vs. 76.0±14.3 mL; p=0.04), and increase in HR (81±9 bpm vs. 75±9 bpm; p<0.001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that hypocapnia and increased V T independently reduce SV and increase HR in POTS patients. The increase in HR was greater during hypocapnia (+18 bpm) compared to increased V T (+6 bpm). Reducing hypocapnia presents an attractive therapeutic target.

Pore size distribution is a key parameter in the performance of biobased pyrolytic char in novel applications. In industrial-scale production, the size of feedstock particles typically exceeds a few millimeters. For such particle sizes, it is a challenge to tailor the final properties of the char based only on the process conditions (experimental and modeling-wise). Pyrolysis studies of single particles larger than a few millimeters provide data sets useful for modeling and optimization of the process. Part 1 of this research focused on the pyrolysis of single particles of beech wood, secondary cracking, and its effect on the char porous texture. It contains a quantitative assessment of the effects of five conversion temperatures (from 300 to 840 °C) and two particle dimensions (Ø8 × 10 mm and Ø8 × 16 mm) on the composition of the pyrolysis vapors and pore morphology of the char. Results from real-time temperature and mass changes are presented along with release profiles of 15 vapor constituents measured by infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, characterization of the collected bio-oil (using GC-MS/FID) and the textural hierarchical structured char (through N2 and CO2 adsorption, Hg porosimetry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) was performed. Cracking of vapors above 500 °C was compound-specific. The polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) yield, between 680 and 840 °C, increased 5 times for 10 mm particles and 9 times for 16 mm ones. Besides temperature, PAH yield was suspected to correlate with particle length and PAHs/soot deposition in the micropores. Results showed that the macropores accounted for over 80% of the total pore volume, regardless of the temperature and particle length. Increasing the particle length by 60% caused a reduction in the specific surface area (ca. 15% at 840 °C) of the resulting char, mainly due to a reduction in microporosity. Based on the findings, the production conditions for a specific char application are suggested. The obtained data will be used in Part 2 of this research, devoted to subsequent CFD modeling of the process.

This study investigated the potential use of spent pot-lining (SPL) as a supplementary fuel in blast furnaces to replace pulverized coal (PC). Based on actual blast furnace operational parameters, a three-dimensional numerical model is established to simulate the complex flow and reaction processes in the tuyere raceway. The impact of the proportion of SPL in the mixed fuel from 0 % to 45 % on the thermochemical characteristics of the mixed fuel combustion is analyzed. The results indicate that with an increase in SPL proportion, the combustion peak temperature (2511 K-2922 K) and the average temperature in the raceway (2014 K-2474 K) of the mixed fuel both increase. However, the combustion rate of the mixed fuel decreases, highlighting the need for a rational design of the mixed fuel ratio to optimize combustion performance. The SPL proportion has minimal influence on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airflow but significantly affects combustion and thermal properties, altering the distribution of gas-phase components. Through linear regression and correlation analysis, linear relationships between SPL proportion and combustion rate, peak temperature in the raceway, and CO and CO2 mass fractions are established. This research holds substantial significance and value in advancing the technology of using industrial waste SPL to replace part of the coal powder as blast furnace injection fuel, promoting the development of green metallurgical technologies, and contributing to global energy conservation and emission reduction.

Several recently signed environmental agreements and protocols emphasize the global need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on limiting coal consumption due to high NOX and CO2 emissions. However, many countries, including those in the Western Balkans, rely heavily on coal for electricity generation. The outdated thermal power plant infrastructure in these regions poses a major challenge when it comes to meeting modern environmental standards while maintaining efficiency. This study is part of the more comprehensive research which aims to develop an expert system that utilizes existing measurements to estimate key parameters crucial for both energy production and pollution reduction. The focus is on Serbian thermal power plants, particularly plant ?Nikola Tesla? unit B1. One of the critical parameters for optimizing thermal power plant control loops is the heating value of coal, which is challenging to measure in real time due to the coal's varying chemical compositions and caloric values. This paper examines 74 different parameters measured in 59 instances to estimate the hating value of coal at unit B1. Through detailed analysis and feature selection methods, including linear regression, this research aims to identify the most informative parameters for estimating the heating value of coal, which will improve the control system that enables more efficient and environmentally friendly power generation in coal fired thermal power plants.

The currently most promising approach for reducing CO2 emissions of the global steel production is reducing iron ore in shaft furnaces with (green) hydrogen instead of blast furnaces. Unlike to the liquid iron produced in blast furnaces, the direct reduced iron produced in this route (green iron) exists in a solid state and can be transported at reasonable costs over long distances. This allows for spatial decoupling of the iron reduction step from the steelmaking step and may lead to global trade in green iron as a new intermediate product in the steelmaking value chain. This article assesses the potential impact of a global green iron trade in terms of shifting energy demand between regions and in regarding global costs by comparing two scenarios for a global near-zero GHG steel industry: one assuming strict regional co-location of green iron and steel production and one assuming global green iron trade and associated relocation of iron production. In the Green Iron Trade scenario, 21% of global crude steel is produced from traded green iron in 2050. More than 26 Mt/a of hydrogen consumption is relocated to global "sweet spots", resulting in cost savings of 3.9% of the global annual production costs, which can provide important support for the development of net zero steel production. Enablers and barriers for global green iron trade are discussed.

Integrated Energy Systems (IES) play a pivotal role in achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. However, previous research in IES operation has mainly focused on energy flow constraints, neglecting the impacts of renewable energy output, energy prices, carbon emission, and storage status. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a Comprehensive Self-Adaptive (CSA) operation strategy as a key component of our two-tier synergistic optimization method, optimizing an IES integrated with Concentrated Photovoltaic/Thermal systems. In the upper-tier capacity configuration, the proposed method considers the full life-cycle carbon emissions of equipment. In the lower-tier operational strategy optimization, the CSA operation strategy automatically adjusts energy generation, utilization, and storage by comprehensively evaluating hourly operating costs, hourly carbon emissions, and hourly storage benefits. Compared to traditional operation strategies and other adaptive methods, the newly developed strategy consistently demonstrates superior performance. When contrasted with separate energy systems, IES operating under the CSA operation strategy markedly stands out, achieving a cost savings rate of 25.87%, a CO2 reduction rate of 61.54%, and an electricity matching ratio of 91.24%. Additionally, the paper explores the performance of the CSA operation strategy across various regions, confirming its feasibility and generalizability under diverse load and irradiance conditions.

Given the increasing demand for sustainable energy sources and the need to revalorize agro-industrial waste, this work presents the slow pyrolysis of a widely available agro-industrial biomass waste (pecan nut shells) in the presence of natural mineral additives such as dolomite, natural zeolite (clinoptilolite), and limestone (calcium carbonate), with a focus on elucidating the impact of the natural additives on increasing the quality of the pyrolysis products. In addition, the effect of a simple additive pretreatment (calcination) has been evaluated to develop an insight into its influence on the pyrolysis reaction. Slow pyrolysis of pecan nut shells was conducted using a lab-scale batch reactor, from room temperature to 600°C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min; the resulting products were collected and characterized with several instruments such as GC-MS and GC-TCD. Additive calcination caused chemical phase changes, a significant loss of total acid sites, reduction of surface area (except for calcined limestone), and elimination of micropores. A remarkable increase in the condensate product yield between 42% and 114% was observed for most tests where additives were used. Further investigation using GC-MS revealed that guaiacol and dimethoxyphenol were the primary products in the liquid phase, which underwent more pronounced deoxygenation when calcined additives were present in the pyrolysis tests, favoring the generation of organic derivatives (such as phenol, cresol, and xylenol) along with other molecules with low oxygen content. Calcined limestone showed the highest solid yield compared with the rest of the additives at the expense of liquid production. Furthermore, the presence of additives favored higher content of H2, CH4, CO and CO2 in the gas products compared with the control test; the calcined limestone additive promoted the highest hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide concentrations in the gas due to CO2 adsorption and mineralization, along with the enhancement of other reactions such as bio-oil decarbonylation, catalytic cracking and the Boudouard reaction. In turn, the H2/CO ratio obtained with this additive was also the highest, with a value of 1, making it a promising candidate for syngas-production applications. Overall, the present study contributes valuable insight into the utilization of pecan nut shells to produce fuel precursor molecules and other value-added products, emphasizing the impact of mineral additives on the pyrolysis outcome. Our findings suggest a potential alternative for the revalorization of overlooked agroindustrial byproducts, contributing to the development of more sustainable energy sources.

Aging is associated with reductions in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and cerebrovascular conductance (CVC), which may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disease and stroke. In the peripheral vasculature, increased oxidative stress is linked to vascular dysfunction and is ameliorated following infusion of the antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA). However, oxidative stress’ effect on cerebrovascular function in humans is not entirely understood. PURPOSE: To determine whether oxidative stress reduces CVR and CVC in middle-aged and older adults (MA/O). We hypothesized that AA infusion would increase CVR and CVC in MA/O but not young adults (YA). METHODS: Young (18-29 years) and middle-aged and older (55-79 years) adults were recruited for two identical experimental visits. Each visit consisted of the same measures performed both before and after the infusion of either AA or saline (SAL). Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) was recorded using a transcranial Doppler ultrasound probe. CVR was tested using a hypercapnia protocol that was achieved with a computer-based gas blender that increased the subjects’ end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PETCO2) 9 mmHg above baseline for a 3-minute period. CVR was defined as the percent change in MCAv during hypercapnia divided by the absolute change in PETCO2. CVC was defined as the percent of CVR normalized for the changes in mean arterial blood pressure. Two-way ANOVAs were used to assess the effects of AA and SAL on CVR and CVC. Fisher’s LSD tests were used to assess main and interaction effects when necessary. RESULTS: 8 YA (25 + 2 years) and 14 MA/O (65 + 6 years) completed the experimental visits. There was a significant main effect of condition (pre/post) on CVR following SAL infusion (p = 0.016), and a significant age x condition interaction effect on CVR following AA infusion (p = 0.016). There were no significant main or interaction effects on CVC following SAL infusion, but there was a significant age x condition interaction effect on CVC following AA infusion (p = 0.012). Post hoc testing indicated that the difference in CVR following SAL infusion was due to an increase in YA (3.0 + 0.5 %/mmHg pre vs. 3.8 + 1.1 %/mmHg post, p = 0.047), whereas the difference in CVR following AA infusion was due to an increase in MA/O (3.3 + 1.7 %/mmHg pre vs. 4.1 + 1.9 %/mmHg post, p = 0.006). The difference in CVC was indicated to be due to both lower baseline CVC in MA/O (2.3 + 0.4 %/mmHg YA pre vs. 1.3 + 1.1 %/mmHg MA/O pre, p = 0.019) and an increase in CVC in MA/O following AA infusion (1.3 + 1.1 %/mmHg pre vs. 2.0 + 0.5 %/mmHg post, p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Our main finding is that AA infusion restores CVR and CVC in MA/O, but not YA. This finding suggests that age-related increases in oxidative stress may impair cerebrovascular function.

Asphalt road construction projects pose a lot of challenges in different disciplines, from the choice of construction methods, type and quantity of machines and personnel, pre-planning of all processes, ordering material from asphalt mixing plants, real-time logistics of handling material transport, and the asphalt paving and compaction process itself. Depending on the complexity and size of the construction site, preparation and execution can be influenced by a lot of unknown variables, like weather impact, material properties of the delivered asphalt or delays in the deliveries themselves. These circumstances might lead to irregularities in the asphalt material temperatures and thus suboptimal conditions for compaction or even construction stoppage - in any case, they lead to a reduction in quality of the built asphalt road. In recent years, a lot of mobile devices, sensors and software have been emerging as viable solutions in the construction industry to digitize and support these processes. Those real-time applications allow deeper insight into logistics or material properties on site and acquire data for downstream analysis. These endeavours in process optimization now benefit construction companies to increase efficiency, and for work safety and environmental aspects, it is crucial to optimize energy and CO2 consumption. Improved logistics and building roads with low-temperature asphalt will have to become a standard in road construction. The present study gives an overview of the digitalized processes in asphalt road construction with market-available solutions focusing on logistics data of the material delivery chain from mixing plant to paver, thermal imaging data of the built asphalt to validate asphalt temperatures, as well as machine and location data from asphalt paver and compaction rollers.

In the pursuit of carbon neutrality, state-owned forests are prime candidates for carbon offset projects due to their unique tenure and management characteristics. Employing methodologies endorsed by the International Panel on Climate Change and logistic growth curves, this study assesses the carbon stocks and sequestration potential of established state-owned plantation forests across 31 Chinese provinces from 2023 to 2060, encompassing seven forestry industry groups. This study projects that by 2060, these forests will amass a carbon stock of 558.25 MtC, with the highest stock in Northeast China (122.09 MtC) and the lowest in Northwest China (32.27 MtC), notably showing the highest growth rate at 91.15%. Over the forecast period, they are expected to accumulate a carbon sink of 637.07 MtCO2e, translating to an average annual carbon sink of 17.22 MtCO2e and an average annual carbon sink per unit of 1.41 tons of CO2 per hectare per year. Additionally, state-owned forests have the potential to offset approximately 0.15%–0.17% of annual carbon emissions, aligning with international climate goals. However, it is essential to note that the conversion of these carbon sinks into tradable carbon credits is subject to specific methodology requirements. Therefore, the future development of carbon offset projects in China’s state-owned forests should consider the advancement of carbon market mechanisms, including the Chinese Certified Emission Reduction and the introduction of a carbon inclusion mechanism and natural forest methodology, to fully realize their potential contributions to carbon neutrality. In summary, these findings offer valuable insights for shaping the future of carbon offset initiatives within China’s state-owned forests.

Steam reforming is a promising approach to remove biomass gasification tar impurities. Noble metal promotion (Pt/Pd/Rh), Ni + Co loading (20–40 wt%) and calcination temperature (600–800 °C) effects were investigated with hydrotalcite-derived Ni-Co/Mg(Al)O catalysts for bio-syngas tar steam reforming. Fresh catalysts were characterized by XRD, ICP-MS, XRF, N2-physisorption, H2-chemisorption and TPR. Small-diameter metal particles were achieved (5.1–5.8 nm) below a Ni + Co loading threshold (above 30 wt%). Model bio-syngas activity tests were performed (CH4/H2/CO/CO2 molar ratio = 10/35/25/25, 700 °C, steam-to-carbon = 3.0) with and without tar addition (toluene/1-methylenaphthalene, 10 g/Nm3). Tar elimination was achieved with all samples. Enhanced reforming activity accompanied by strong tar active site inhibition effects were found for the Rh promoted catalyst. Noble metal promoted samples were effectively reduced in the bio-syngas environment (H2/CO/CH4) without any pre-reduction (in situ activation by the action of the syngas) with Rh > Pt > Pd. Coke characterization was conducted with TPO-MS and Raman spectroscopy. High-dispersion 20NiCo/30NiCo samples were strongly deactivated through active site inhibition and coke formation. High-temperature calcination (800 °C) reduced the deactivation effects of the coke deposition, attributed to enhanced Mg(Al)O-assisted coke gasification.

Nunavik is a remote region in northern Quebec, Canada relying on off-grid diesel-based electricity production. In this study, photovoltaic (PV) systems for residential buildings are optimized using real electricity consumption data. The region is characterized by a significant temporal mismatch between electricity demand and PV production. Two PV systems are studied: standalone arrays and building-integrated systems (BIPV). Three multiobjective optimization problems are formulated to represent different ways to manage the demand-production mismatch, involving objectives such as the mean squared error between production and consumption, penetration of solar energy, energy gap between production and usage, and PV size. Solutions were obtained using a genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). It was found that moderately sized PV systems (60–140 m2) could cover about one third of the instantaneous electricity demand of a semi-detached house, yielding an average annual GHG emissions reduction of 1.112 ton CO2 per house. An important surplus was found with two optimization problems, suggesting a potential for reinjection in the microgrid or batteries. Optimal designs of PV systems for both configurations were influenced by how the mismatch is managed, i.e. the choice of objective functions. The first optimization problem minimized excess energy by favoring less sunny directions, while the second and third supported energy storage or surplus reinjection, favoring south facing or vertical PVs. A robustness analysis underscored the importance of matching PV system design to consumption profiles. Ultimately, this study contributes to the emerging field of renewable energy integration in the Arctic, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Abstract Background and Aims Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in classifying foods based on the extent and purpose of industrial processing according to the NOVA system, which outlines four main food categories: unprocessed and minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods (UPFs). The latter is characterized by industrial formulations with an elevated content of additives, sugar, unhealthy fat, and sodium. Increased consumption of UPFs can worsen metabolic derangements that develop as kidney function decreases in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We evaluated food intake according to the NOVA food classification system before and after a medically tailored meal intervention with plant-based food baskets for patients with CKD who had hyperkalemia at inclusion and received sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) to normalize plasma potassium. Additionally, we aimed to assess the diets’ environmental impact by evaluating the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) associated with these dietary changes. Method Data were based on a six-week feasibility one-arm clinical study, the HELPFUL trial (identifier: NCT04207203), that enrolled 26 adult patients with CKD stages 4 and 5, not on dialysis and with plasma potassium 5.1-6.5 mmol/L at inclusion. In the first 3 weeks, patients were guided to adhere to a low-protein and low-potassium diet with concomitant use of SZC. The following 3 weeks, patients received food baskets containing fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and either white meat, fish or egg to provide a healthy low-protein high-potassium diet. To assess dietary changes, 24-hour food recalls were collected at weeks 0, 3 and 6 and subsequently classified according to the NOVA classification. The mean adequacy ratio to the dietary recommended intake (DRI) of 11 nutrients (MAR-11 score) was calculated to assess dietary quality. Furthermore, the 24-hour food recalls were linked to GHGE estimations for analysis of environmental impact using the RISE food climate database which is representative of Swedish food consumption. Statistical analyses using Friedman's test or ANOVA for repeated measures were employed to identify significant differences before and after the plant-based food basket intervention. This study was funded by Astra Zeneca. Results The plasma potassium (mmol/L) normalized after the use of SZC (week 0: 5.52 ± 0.3; week 3: 4.72 ± 0.4; week 6: 4.8 ± 0.4; P &lt; 0.01). Figure 1 shows changes in energy intake according to the NOVA classification. A significant reduction in UPF consumption (P = 0.024) was observed. In the post-hoc analysis, the change between week 3 and 6 was borderline significant (P = 0.052) while that between week 0 and 6 was statistically significant (P = 0.008). The healthy food basket diet led to a significant increase in dietary fibers (P = 0.002) and servings of fruits (P &lt; 0.01), vegetables (P = 0.04), nuts (P &lt; 0.01), poultry (P = 0.02), and fish (P &lt; 0.001) and reduced servings of red meat (P = 0.03). As a result, the MAR-11 score increased significantly (P = 0.021). The GHGE analysis of carbon dioxide equivalents revealed no differences between emissions (median and interquartile range) in week 0 [1.79 (1.24; 3.13)], week 3 [1.79 (1.47; 2.74)] and week 6 [1.87 (1.51; 2.61)]. Conclusion Delivering medically tailored healthy food baskets to patients with CKD with concomitant use of SZC led to increased dietary quality and decreased UPF intake. However, these beneficial changes were not aligned with a decrease in GHGE, highlighting the complex relationship between dietary choices and environmental impact.

This dataset was moved to: https://doi.org/10.34725/DVN/24343The FAO Mitigation of Climate Change in Agriculture (MICCA) programme is to facilitate developing countries pursue climate change mitigation measures in agriculture and move towards low-emissions agricultural practices http://www.fao.org/climatechange/micca/79677/en/ The project is funded by the Government of Finland through UN - FAO Goals and activities The main goal of the MICCA pilots project implemented by ICRAF, is to show results on the ground to provide quantifiable evidence that climate-smart agricultural practices can mitigate climate change, improve farmers' lives and make local communities better able to adapt to climate change , and thus persuade farmers, national policy-makers, international organizations and donors that climate-smart agriculture is a priority. To address this need, MICCA is carrying out two pilot projects in Africa. http://www.fao.org/climatechange/micca/79578/en/ i. Enhancing agricultural mitigation within the East African Dairy Development Project (EADD), Kaptumo, Western Kenya This project builds upon sites of the Gates funded East Africa Dairy Development (EADD) project. The EADD project is a regional industry development program led by Heifer International in partnership with the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), TechnoServe, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and the African Breeders Service (ABS) Total Cattle Manage ment. Working with the EADD partners at the Kenya site in Kaptumo, MICCA efforts aims at adding value to the dairy development efforts by building capacity for the integration of climate-smart practices that simultaneously increase productivity, income and ecosystem resilience within the farming systems of small holder farmers and along the value chain - quantifying subsequent greenhouse gas reductions along with other benefits. This is being done by establishing a baseline and monitoring changes in GHGs and ecosystem processes and productivity with and without the implementation of climate smart practices agreed upon by the Dairy Farmers Business Associations. We measure GHGs emissions from a complete zero grazing set up, semi- zero grazing and non- zero grazing farm system to compare the systems and thereafter advice farmers on the best practice that reduce emission and increase agricultural productivity. ii. HICAP (CARE Tanzania) - Hillside Conservation Agriculture Project. The CARE Hillside Conservation Agriculture Project in the South Uluguru mountains of Tanzania is aimed at improving livelihoods through the integration of conservation agriculture into farming systems. The MICCA project offers an opportunity to add further value to community based conservation agriculture practices being implemented by clarifying the mitigation potential of these practices as well as the integra tion of trees on farm and in the landscape. With suitable methodologies the project will measure the increase in carbon accumulation across the landscape as a result of climate smart practices, thus providing evidence for the contribution of small-holder farmers to mitigating the impacts of climate change. MICCA aims at developing the capacity for the integration of additional climate-smart practices that simultaneously increase productivity and ecosystem resilience within the farming systems of small holder farmers - quantifying subsequent greenhouse gas reductions along with other benefits associated with risk reduction and adaptation. This is being done by establishing a baseline and measuring above and below ground carbon as well as monitoring changes in non CO2 GHGs and ecosystem processes and productivity with and without the introduction of climate smart practices on farms.

Стратегия замены клинкера активными минеральными добавками (АМД) представляется кратчайшим путем к дости­жению целей устойчивого развития, требующим минимальных капиталовложений. Внедрение кальцинированных глин в каче­стве АМД в российской цементной промышленности позволило бы увеличить производство цементов для всех областей применения. Предварительный анализ геологии глин на террито­рии РФ показывает, что химический и минеральный состав глин некоторых выявленных месторождений позволяет использовать их для производства обожженных глин. Эти месторождения глины находятся близко к существующим цементным заводам, благодаря чему могут эксплуатироваться в промышленных мас­штабах. Сочетание прокаленной глины и известняка становится очень привлекательным для частичной замены клинкера в це­менте. Цементы, в состав которых входят эти компоненты, могут достигать таких же характеристик, как у портландцемента без минеральных добавок, при содержании клинкера всего 50 %. Использование обожженной глины и известняка как заменителей клинкера приводит к сокращению выбросов углекислого газа на 35—45 % по сравнению с эталонными показателями, до 400—500 кг CO2 на 1 т цемента. Внедрение технологии производства цементов, содержащих известняк и кальцинированную глину (Limestone Calcined Clay Cement, LC3) могло бы стать интересной возможностью для цементных компаний в РФ, поскольку оно позволяет им переоборудовать в установки прокаливания глины те печи обжига клинкера, которые недостаточно эффективны, и увеличить производство цемента. РФ обладает необходимыми ресурсами и технологическим потенциалом для того, чтобы стать мировым лидером в производстве LC3. The strategy of substituting clinker by supplementary cementitious materials, SCM appears to be the shortest and less capital-intensive path to sustainability. Introducing calcined clays as SCMs in the Russian cement industry will facilitate the production of cements that can be used in all applications. A preliminary analysis of the geology of clays within the Russian Federation shows that several of the clays identified comply with chemical requirements to be used for the production of calcined clays. These clay deposits are very close to the existing cement plants, thus making commercial operation feasible. The combination of calcined clay and limestone becomes a very attractive choice for clinker replacement in cement. Cements containing calcined clay and limestone can reach performance of a pure Portland cement with only 50 % of clinker. The use of calcined clay and limestone as substitutes of clinker induces reductions in carbon emissions in the order of 35-45 % compared to benchmark references, with emission figures estimated within 400-500 kg CO2/ ton of cement. Embracing the LC3 technology could represent an interesting opportunity for cement companies in the Russian Federation to convert their inefficient clinker kilns to clay calciners, and increase cement production with current clinker availability. The Russian Federation has the necessary resources and the potential in technology to become a world leader in the production of LC3 cement.

Land surface models diverge in their predictions of the Amazon forest's response to climate change-induced droughts, with some showing a catastrophic collapse of forests, while others simulating resilience. Therefore, observations of tropical ecosystem responses to real-world droughts and other extreme events are needed. We report long-term seasonal dynamics of photosynthesis, respiration, net carbon exchange, phenology, and tree demography and characterize the effect of dry and wet events on ecosystem form and function at the Tapajós National Forest, Brazil, using over two decades of eddy covariance observations that include the 2015–2016 El Niño drought and La Niña 2008–2009 wet periods. We found strong forest responses to both ENSO events: La Niña saw forest net carbon loss from reduced photosynthesis (due to lower incoming radiation from increased cloudiness) even as ecosystem respiration (Reco) was maintained at mean seasonal levels. El Niño induced the opposite short-term effect, net carbon gains, despite significant reductions in photosynthesis (from a drought-induced halving of canopy conductance to CO2 and significant losses of leaf area), because drought suppression of Reco losses was even greater. However, long-term responses to the two climate perturbations were very different: transient during La Niña –the forest returned to its "normal" state as soon as the climate did, and long-lasting during El Niño –leaf area loss and associated declines in photosynthetic capacity (Pc) and canopy conductance were exacerbated and extended by feedbacks from higher temperatures and atmospheric evaporative demand and persisted for ∼3+ years after normal rainfall resumed. These findings indicate that these forests are more vulnerable to drought than to excess rain, because drought drives significant changes in forest structure (e.g., leaf-abscission and mortality) and ecosystem function (e.g. reduced stomatal conductance). As future Amazonian climate change increases frequencies of hydrological extremes, these mechanisms will determine the long-term fate of tropical forests.

Thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) is an important redox reaction that markedly alters hydrocarbons in deep reservoirs. Although the major achievements that involve reaction mechanism, process, and geochemical characteristics were attained in the last 50 years, a quantitative TSR model that includes major products was not built, which restricts the understanding of the reaction mechanism and the generation process of hydrocarbons in TSR. In this study, two series of thermal simulation experiments of the TSR involving n-octadecane (n-C18) and n-dodecylbenzene (C12B) with MgSO4 and H2O in a confined gold-tube system were conducted, and all the major products in different phases, particularly oxygen-containing compounds, were quantitatively analyzed. The results indicated that the high-molecular-weight (HMW) oxygenated compounds in heavy products were predominated by ketones, followed by alcohol and acids, and the low-molecular-weight (LMW) organic acids in water mainly comprised acetic acids, followed by formic acid and propionic acid. Both oxygen-containing compounds prompted the TSR process but in different ways. The accumulation of HMW oxygenated compounds in the non-autocatalytic stages was essential for initiating the catalyzed reaction of TSR. In addition, the oxygenated compounds of hydrocarbons enhance polarity, making hydrocarbons easier to contact with HSO4− or [MgSO4] CIP. The LMW organic acids possibly prompted the TSR process by acidifying the water and thus facilitating the formation of HSO4− and [MgSO4] CIP. The oxidation reaction during TSR possibly converted HMW oxygenated compounds to LMW organic acids and CO2. The quantitative analysis of products in TSR revealed that TSR destroyed the hydrocarbons more rapidly but in a different way from thermal cracking and that the generation process of hydrocarbon types in TSR was in the following order: heavy hydrocarbon, gaseous hydrocarbon/light hydrocarbon/solid bitumen, and gaseous hydrocarbon/solid bitumen. Compared with oil cracking, the TSR promoted the oil reservoir to rapidly progress to more mature stages. The hydrocarbon precursor and reaction extent affected the generation process and the character of all products in the TSR. These results can provide an improved understanding of the TSR mechanism and process and be useful in the evaluation of petroleum potential for TSR-altered oils.

However, highest performance in solar energy conversion can only be achieved, when using optimum absorber layers and advanced contact formation for electronic and chemical passivation, i.e. for the protection of the solid-liquid interface against corrosion as well as impeding interfacial non-radiative recombination. In order to address the surface and interface properties of III-V semiconductor layer structures in relation to their performance, we present the synthesis, theoretical modelling and properties of critical and well-defined interfaces such as GaInP/AlInP [4] or GaInP/GaN [5]. Here, lattice matched n-type GaN or AlInP(100) charge selective contacts are prepared on n-p GaInP(100) top absorbers in highest-efficiency III–V multijunction solar or photoelectrochemical cells, where the cell performance can be greatly limited by missing electron selectivity and detrimental valance band offsets. Hence, understanding of the atomic and electronic properties of the heterointerfaces, for instance, is crucial for the reduction of photocurrent losses in III–V multijunction devices. We discuss the essential considerations on the properties of critical interfaces in relation to photoelectrochemical cells from a conceptual and from a theoretical modeling point of view assuming mostly idealized surface conditions. We also address latest progress on the important III-V/Si interface, modifications by fine-tuning of the preparation and describe experimental model experiments on the surface reactivity of III-phosphide surfaces to H2O exposure. These different surface science approaches are then related to photoelectrochemical cells for H2 evolution and CO2 reduction using different III-V based tandem cells and providing highest conversion yields.

A large number of oceanic metagenomic data and environmental metadata have been published. However, most studies focused on limited ecosystems using different analysis tools, making it challenging to integrate these data into robust results and comprehensive global understanding of marine microbiome. Here, we constructed a systematic and quantitative analysis platform, the Microbiome Atlas/Sino-Hydrosphere for Ocean Ecosystem (MASH-Ocean: https://www.biosino.org/mash-ocean/), by integrating global marine metagenomic data and a unified data processing flow. MASH-Ocean 1.0 comprises 2147 metagenomic samples with five analysis modules: sample view, diversity, function, biogeography, and interaction network. This platform provides convenient and stable support for researchers in microbiology, environmental science, and biogeochemistry, to ensure the integration of omics data generated from hydrosphere ecosystems, to bridge the gap between elusive omics data and biological, ecological, and geological discovery, ultimately to foster the formation of a comprehensive atlas for aquatic environments. Oceans account for approximately 71% of the total surface area of Earth, making them the largest habitats for life on this planet. They contribute to over 90% of the total volume of the biosphere and are responsible for nearly half of the global total primary productivity [1]. It has been estimated that marine ecosystems host a remarkable number of over 1029 bacterial and archaeal cells [2]. These microbes exhibit vast diversity and are ubiquitously distributed across various oceanic environments, including both sea water and subsurface from intertidal zone, euphotic layer, and deep sea. Moreover, they thrive in special geological areas such as hydrothermal vents, cold seep regions, subduction zones, and oceanic crust. Active biogeochemical cycling mediated by these microorganisms through their carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolisms can directly influence the Earth's climate [3]. Therefore, it is critical to understand the diversity, function, and biogeography of marine microbiome. With the ongoing advancements in oceanic sampling technologies and high-throughput sequencing platforms in recent years, scientists have discovered a wide variety of microorganisms with different ecological and geological functions in various marine habitats [4]. Microorganisms inhabiting distinct ecological niches may specifically play key roles in driving certain geochemical cycles and mediating the fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur among sediment, sea water, and atmosphere [3]. Currently, an increasing number of metagenomic studies focusing on various types of oceanic environments have been reported [5]. For example, in sea water, archaea, bacteria, protist, and virus have been found to play significant roles in influencing the release of organic matter, mineralization, and fixation of carbon dioxide [6]. In sediments, the abundance and diversity of microorganisms is much higher than that in marine water bodies and primarily facilitates the anaerobic degradation of organic matter, sulfate reduction, methane production, and oxidation [7]. In summary, the analyses of multiple omics data have revealed a significant presence of microorganisms in oceanic environments that actively participate in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur elements. Although high-throughput metagenomic sequencing technology has greatly promoted microbiological research, each individual study has employed different analytical processes. These analysis results often show substantial heterogeneity when compared with each other. Only by accumulating and analyzing metagenomic data in a standard way, scientists would be able to reach robust conclusions and generate comparable results. Several platforms, such as Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) [8] and Marine Metagenomics Portal (MMP) [9], support preliminary analysis of metagenomic or genomic data. Recent developments of online microbiome analysis platforms, for example, Wekemo Bioincloud [10] and MicrobiomeAnalyst [11], have also facilitated researchers in exploring the biological significance of metagenomic samples by providing multiple analysis tools and interactive visualization capabilities. Nevertheless, a gap still exists between elusive omics data and biological, ecological, and geological discovery. Here, we have established an online microbiome platform called the Microbiome Atlas/Sino-Hydrosphere for Ocean Ecosystems (MASH-Ocean, https://www.biosino.org/mash-ocean/), aiming to bridge this gap and achieve standardized, interactive analyses of massive metagenomic data, and to explore the knowledge atlas related to microbial mediated oceanic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. MASH-Ocean is a website-based platform (Figure 1A). This platform collects public metagenome data related to global marine environments and assembles and annotates these data with a uniform standard bioinformatic workflow. The current database contains annotations of microbial taxonomic features derived from metagenomic reads and metabolic functional features from assembled metagenomic contigs. These results can be visualized by online users without the well-established knowledge of bioinformatics and omics. Three major advantages of the MASH-Ocean platform are microbial diversity analysis, metabolic feature reconstruction and comparison using selectable metagenomic datasets globally, as well as interactive visualization of global distribution of the selected functional genes or microbial species (Movie S1). All data within MASH-Ocean 1.0 was collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and the National Omics Data Encyclopedia (NODE) databases (https://www.biosino.org/node/) by September 2020 with a total of 75 keywords (Table S1). Metagenomes were also filtered out manually by their size (below 200 MB), descriptions such as "enriched," "metatranscriptome," and "amplicon," as well as the restricted datasets from DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI). In total, 2147 samples from different marine environments were selected for further analyses to build a basic knowledge pool for MASH-Ocean 1.0 (Figure 1B). Additionally, MASH-Ocean keeps downloading and filtering public oceanic metagenomic data to maintain and update this platform. The second batch of data (September 2023) has been downloaded and is under the analyzing process. The MASH-Ocean 1.0 workflow encompasses both reads-level and contigs-level analyses (Figure 1C,D). Specifically, the platform currently hosts two primary data categories: "clean reads" consisting of 210 billion sequences (totaling 44.2 trillion base pairs) and "contigs" comprising 257 million sequences (totaling 555.3 billion base pairs). For microbial taxonomy analysis, trimmed metagenomic reads were annotated by Kraken2 v2.1.3 [12], and the abundance was estimated by Bracken v2.6.1 [13]. For metabolic feature analysis, the trimmed reads were assembled by MEGAHIT v1.2.9 [14]. The contigs coverage was calculated by mapping the trimmed reads to each contig using BBMap v38.18 [15]. All contigs were subjected to open reading frame (ORF) prediction with Prodigal v2.6.3 [16]. The predicted ORFs were annotated by eggNOG database [17]. On this platform, all samples can be found in "Sample view" section on the website. The table here shows 10 key information of samples. Users can locate specific samples or narrow down the sample pool by providing key information in the navigation panel (Figure 1B). For the fields of Run/Project/Sample ID, we provide a field matching search mode, allowing users to match all complete fields and help them select the appropriate item by typing in part of the string. For the fields of Habitat source, Env Zone, Env Medium, Fraction, and Location, we provide a composite selection method that combines field matching with a drop-down box to provide users with a convenient operation experience. Flexible selections are also supported by providing a drag bar with information of longitude, latitude, and water depth. The selected samples can be displayed on a global topographic map by clicking on the "Display Map" button, located at the top right of the sample table, to easily obtain a panoramic view of sample distribution. MASH-Ocean also provides a comprehensive diversity analysis using taxonomic information produced through the annotation of metagenomic reads. Users can either generate microbial diversity profiles at different taxonomic levels or statistically compare the diversity among different samples by setting up distinct groups. In general, this platform allows users to establish five groups in total to carry out the diversity comparison, with at least three selected samples in each group. The diversity statistical comparison results can be divided into different taxonomic levels, that is, archaea, bacteria, eukaryota, and viruses, each of which contains six ranks including Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. In total, four types of comparisons are included in the platform (Figure 2A). The first diagram is the taxonomic composition of the selected samples calculated by Kraken2 and Bracken programs. The second analysis is the ranking of taxonomically distinctive members between different groups, which is calculated by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe). The third analysis is the heatmap of beta-diversity distances using Jaccard or Bray-Curtis matrix, and a principal coordinates analysis of all selected samples will also be calculated and displayed by using the beta-diversity distances. The function analysis is designed for the visualization of the presence and abundance of key genes and modules from the major carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolic functional pathways of selected samples. These pathways are critical for global biogeochemical cycling and may therefore influence the Earth's climate. The function analysis module allows users to integrate their own data set with the MASH-Ocean database through three options. One can upload a file with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) list with the sequencing depth corresponding to those KOs. Users can also upload a file with the predicted ORFs ID and annotated KOs, as well as a sequencing depth file together. The final result will be displayed as a KEGG map, and the relative abundance of metabolic functional genes are shown in red gradient color (Figure 2B). If the number of uploaded or selected samples exceeds three, the relative abundance of metabolic functional genes and further distilled KEGG modules will be displayed in a heatmap for better exhibition. MASH-Ocean contains the function of interactive biogeography visualization and analysis. It supports global distribution display for both microbial species and metabolic functional genes. For microbial species analysis, users can either enter a species name or upload a genome to check their global distribution pattern in all or selected metagenomic data set in MASH-Ocean (Figure 2C). MASH-Ocean also allows users to upload their genomes and will be classified using GTDB-Tk version 2.3.2 [18] for taxonomic assignment. Similarly, for metabolic functional genes, one can select the gene name provided within the website or enter a KO entry and then it will be displayed on the global map on our website. MASH-Ocean also contains the function of interactive network visualization. Six pre-established global microbial co-occurrence networks on the species, genus, family, order, class, and phylum levels were integrated. If users focus on the interaction of one or several specific microbes in the global oceanic microbial network, they can enter the name or taxonomic ranks of the microbe. Then this microbe will be highlighted in the entire network and users can either download the complete network or the network of their focused microbe (Figure 2D). The co-occurrence networks were generated using FastSpar v1.0.0 [19] and iDIRECT [20], and parameters are listed in Table S2. MASH-Ocean takes approximately 10–50 min to process the diversity analysis module (Figure 2E), depending on the scale of analysis (ranging from 6 to 150 samples). For the function analysis and biogeography module, the time requirements vary due to the time-consuming sequence preprocessing steps. For instance, when annotating metabolic functions in the function analysis module, MASH-Ocean requires around 1 h for one file with size ~50 MB. In contrast, other modes complete this task in less than 5 min. For the biogeography module, MASH-Ocean processes one genome file in approximately 35 min, and a protein sequence file in about 10 min, while other modes complete tasks with similar sample scales in less than 20 s. As the initiative platform for the MASH project in China, MASH-Ocean offers a convenient and stable service to ensure the integration of omics data generated from hydrosphere ecosystems. In comparison to existing omics online servers, such as IMG/M [8], which focused mainly on storage of metagenomic data with limited capabilities in systematic comparison and visualization, while Wekemo Bioincloud [10] or MicrobiomeAnalyst [11] that specifically provided online analysis tools for meta-omics, MASH-Ocean is designed to provide exploratory insights from a big data perspective for researchers through a one-station service. In the future, besides ocean ecosystems, MASH will include other hydrosphere ecosystems such as wetlands, lakes, rivers, and so on. For the MASH-Ocean platform, there are three aspects that will be upgraded in the coming years. First, the data collection process will continue to accommodate more publicly available resources. Second, except for metagenome, we will include published metatranscriptome data in the future version. Third, we also aim to include microbial genomic data to enhance the integrity of MASH-Ocean. Last but not the least, we will further closely cooperate with other databases and online analysis platforms such as the integrated microbiome analysis cloud platform, an eLibrary of Microbial Systematics and Genomics, NODE databases to enlarge and diversify the content of the MASH-Ocean platform.

This project brought DOE's climate modeling effort with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model into the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP), which is part of the sixth and latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP6. PAMIP examines the causes and consequences of polar amplification, when external forcing results in a larger temperature increase in high latitudes than the global average, in a coordinated set of model experiments with a common modeling protocol. Our teams from UC Irvine and the University of Toronto have designed, carried out, analyzed, and disseminated PAMIP output from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and the Community Earth System Model (CESM). PAMIP's ongoing stream of significant new results have advanced progress in the community's understanding and led to new outstanding research questions that have motivated further work. PAMIP has led to improved consensus on the atmospheric response to sea ice loss. The important finding is that for a similar sea ice anomaly forcing, the simulated atmospheric response in the troposphere is remarkably consistent among the 16 models' runs analyzed. The zonal-mean tropospheric response consists of a very robust equatorward shift of the westerly flow in mid-latitudes. However, while the multi-model mean response is robust, it has a weak amplitude relative to internal variability. We identified a weakness in the models (including E3SM) in terms of their response to sea-ice forcing that is related to eddy forcing (or nonlinear dynamical effects) at mid- to high latitudes. In fact, E3SM is an outlier in terms of the models participating, and in that sense, it turned out to be a vital participant model. We found that reductions in energy transport due sea-ice loss and involving dry air only are compensated by increases in moist energy transport from warmer sea surface temperature in midlatitudes. This leads to a large spread in energy transport into the Arctic and is a potential source of spread in Arctic amplification. We identified an important role that climate modes, including tropical modes of variability (El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO); the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO)) play in the response to sea-ice anomalies, including in ocean coupled experiments. Similarly, we identified and quantified the contribution of sea-ice thickness to the atmospheric response compared to the response to sea-ice extent only. We found that it is important to run large ensembles and even with an ensemble size of 100 simulations the response is largely influenced by internal variability. We demonstrated convincingly that Ural blocking, not sea-ice loss, provides the weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex in fall/early winter and a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation that can last for up to two months. However, sea-ice anomalies can influence the background flow so that the response to Ural blocking is more persistent under low sea-ice conditions in the Barents/Kara Sea than high sea ice. Atmospheric model hierarchies that progressively add individual processes have a long history in providing dynamical insight for modeling the atmosphere. Similarly, coupled model hierarchies that progressively add individual ocean processes can provide insights into the workings of the coupled climate system, however such hierarchies have not been available except for a non-dynamical slab ocean model. Because of the missing processes, surface flux corrections must be added to produce a target climate. In this project, we managed to overcome this problem and develop a globally coupled ocean model hierarchy in CESM that can turn on and off the processes of mixed-layer entrainment and Ekman flow. We used the hierarchy to study the impact of Arctic sea-ice loss on the climate system. We find that the effect of mixed-layer entrainment on ocean heat uptake influences the atmospheric circulation by shifting the latitudinal positions of the mid-latitude westerly jet and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In quadrupled CO2 experiments, we studied how air-sea coupling affects the response of tropical rainfall under global warming. In order to identify the importance of individual ocean processes, we used the hierarchy of ocean models to separate the effects of seasonal mixed-layer entrainment, wind-driven Ekman flows, and frictional flows. We showed that including Ekman and frictional flows allows our simulation to produce the Pacific Ocean's enhanced equatorial warming pattern and equatorward ITCZ contraction noted in previous climate simulations. We also showed that the frictional flow, which has yet to receive much attention, is as important as the Ekman flow in generating equatorial heat convergence.

Introduction: Short-term muscle unloading (~7-10 days) can be usually experienced following injury or hospitalisation, leading to muscle disuse atrophy, muscle weakness and changes in motor control. In such contexts, exercise countermeasures can be employed to overcome these neuromuscular impairments. Surprisingly, the effects of exercise countermeasures following the exposure to muscle unloading has been scarcely investigated. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the functional and molecular adaptations to a 21-day resistance training (RT) program following short term muscle disuse. We hypothesised that a period of resistance exercise following short-term unloading would speed up the recovery on muscle mass and function mostly by an effcient counteraction of the molecular regulators of muscle disuse atrophy consistent with the exercise modality employed. Methods: A 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) model was applied to eleven healthy young males (22.09 ± 2.91 y), followed by a 21-day RT program for the knee extensors performed at 70% of the 1RM (3 times/wk, 9 sessions in total). Data acquisition was performed before the ULLS period, after 10 days of unloading and after 21 days of resistance exercise. Quadriceps femoris isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was evaluated by dynamometry and quadriceps CSA was assessed by ultrasonography. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, a key component of the citric acid cycle and of the respiratory electron transfer chain) staining was performed on frozen cryosections obtained from VL biopsies, whereas western blot analyses were carried out for several mitochondrial-related proteins and transcriptomics data were obtained by RNA-seq. Results: Following ULLS, QF MVC and CSA decreased (-29.3%, p<0.001, and -4.5%, p<0.05, respectively). After the 21-d of RT, MVC was fully brought back (+42% compared to post-ULLS) whereas QF CSA showed a very marked hypertrophy (+18.6%, p<0.001, compared to post-ULLS). SDH immunoreactivity was not affected by unloading but revealed a significant increase after exercise compared to post ULLS values (~+20%, p<0.001). In addition, mitochondrial dynamics were highly influenced by resistance exercise, as mitochondrial pro-fusion (MFN1, MFN2, OPA1) and fission (DRP1, pDRP1616) proteins were markedly increased in response to RT compared to post-ULLS values (p<0.05). Further, PGC-1a levels showed a trend to decrease after ULLS but even a stronger trend to increase after resistance exercise compared to post-ULLS (p=0.056). Transcriptomics analyses showed that the most differentially expressed genes were identified in the pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, in which the top regulated genes after resistance training were mitochondrial related genes (CKMT2, UQCRH, ACSS1, MDH1, COX7A2, CYCS, SLC16A1), presenting a marked reduction after ULLS and being significantly enhanced after RT. When compared to baseline, the genes which showed a positive “rebound effect” after resistance exercise were mostly related to mitochondrial function (MT-ATP6, MT-CO2, MT-ND3). Noteworthy, among these latter genes, the top upregulated one was APLNR, coding for apelin receptor protein, a positive regulator of inter-myofibrillar mitochondrial content in sarcopenia and ageing. Conclusions: Resistance exercise was effective in recovering muscle mass and function after 10 days of disuse, but it enhanced mitochondrial activity, biogenesis, and dynamics far beyond the expected effects for such exercise modality. In fact, mitochondrial-related genes expression was the most affected by exercise. This suggests that mitochondrial dynamics could play an essential role in the recovery of neuromuscular alterations induced by short term disuse. We put forward the hypothesis that the prior level of physical activity and a prior exposure to short-term muscle disuse could be driving the nature of adaptations to subsequent resistance training.
