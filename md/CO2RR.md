Abstract Nickel anchored N-doped carbon electrocatalysts (Ni-N-C) are rapidly developed for the electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR). However, the high-performanced Ni-N-C analogues design for CO2RR remains bewilderment, for the reason lacking of definite guidance for its structure-activity relationship. Herein, the correlation between the proportion of nitrogen species derived from various nitrogen sources and the CO2RR activity of Ni-N-C is investigated. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum combined with the CO2RR performance results show that pyridinic-N content has a positive correlation with CO2RR activity. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that pyridinic-N coordinated Ni-N4 sites offers optimized free energy and favorable selectivity towards CO2RR compared with pyrrolic-N. Accordingly, Ni-Na-C with highest pyridinic-N content (ammonia as nitrogen source) performs superior CO2RR activity, with the maximum carbon monoxide faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 99.8% at -0.88 V vs. RHE and the FECO surpassing 95% within potential ranging of -0.88 to -1.38 V vs. RHE. The building of this parameter for CO2RR activity of Ni-N-C give instructive forecast for low-cost and highly active CO2RR electrocatalysts.&#xD;

Formation of C‐N bonds through the electrochemical utilization of CO2 and nitrogen containing compounds (N‐compounds) is appealing for the purpose of converting waste and readily available sources or pollutants into value added chemicals at ambient conditions. Existing research predominantly explores these electrochemical reactions independently, often in aqueous electrolytes, leading to challenges associated with competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), low product selectivity, and yield. Functional electrolytes such as those containing ionic liquids (ILs) present selective solubility to the solute reactants and present unique interactions with the electrode surface that can suppress the undesired side reaction HER while simultaneously co‐catalyzing the conversion of CO2 and N‐compounds such as N2, NO, NO2, andNO3. In this concept paper, we discuss how the microenvironment enabled by ILs can be leveraged to stabilize reaction intermediates at the electrode‐electrolyte interface, thereby promoting C‐N bond formation on an active electrode surface at reduced overpotential, with the case study of CO2 and N‐compounds co‐catalysis to generate urea.

The role of the coinage metal in monomeric hydride complexes for the reduction of carbon dioxide to formate has been computationally addressed in this work. The common reaction mechanism, i.e. a concerted M‐H (M = Cu, Ag, Au) bond attack to the CO2 carbon atom with one oxygen atom coordinating to the metal center, has been analyzed, revealing a kinetically less favorable reactivity for the gold‐hydride complex. A thorough computational investigation discloses that, while all complexes feature covalent electron‐sharing M‐H bonds, copper‐ and silver‐hydride complexes display a relevant M(δ+)‐H(δ‐) bond polarization, which enables an enhanced basicity of the hydride and, thereby, a more kinetically favorable CO2 reduction process. This study provides useful guidelines for the design of monomeric metal hydride complexes as promising candidates for the CO2 reduction.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for CH4 production presents a promising strategy to address carbon neutrality, and the incorporation of a second metal has been proven effective in enhancing catalyst performance. Nevertheless, there remains limited comprehension regarding the fundamental factors responsible for the improved performance. Herein, the critical role of Pd in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 on Cu-based catalysts has been revealed at a molecular level using in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). A “borrowing” SERS strategy has been developed by depositing Cu–Pd overlayers on plasmonic Au nanoparticles to achieve the in situ monitoring of the dynamic change of the intermediate during CO2RR. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that Pd incorporation significantly enhances selectivity toward CH4 production, and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CH4 is more than two times higher than that for the catalysts without Pd. The key intermediates, including *CO2−, *CO, and *OH, have been directly identified under CO2RR conditions, and their evolution with the electrochemical environments has been determined. It is found that Pd incorporation promotes the activation of both CO2 and H2O molecules and accelerates the formation of abundant active *CO and hydrogen species, thus enhancing the CH4 selectivity. This work offers fundamental insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of CO2RR and opens up possibilities for designing more efficient electrocatalysts.

Corrole, a contracted tetrapyrrolic macrocycle has been also used to design molecular for the CO2 reduction. The electrochemical activity towards CO2 reduction can rival those of their porphyrin analogues. However, the catalytic activity of the metallocorrole is initiated at the corresponding MII/I couple. Accordingly, a catalytic current in presence of CO2 with cobalt corrole appears when the CoI species is generated. We have designed an electron deficient A2B corrole holding two ‐CF3 groups and a benzonitrile in the meso positions and its cobalt complex (1). We reasoned that these groups could shuffle the redox potentials to reach the M(I) oxidation states at more positive values thereby lowering the overpotential for the catalytic CO2 reduction. Our results clearly show that catalyst 1 when adsorbed on a carbon electrode, shows the most favourable catalytic performance for CO production, achieving an efficiency of 85% with a current density of ‐1.5 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.0 V vs NHE. The current densities of controlled potential electrolysis with increasing amount of KHCO3, were found to increase more than one order of magnitude with the formation of MeOH.

More than a century has passed since the hypothesis was first proposed that primordial biological molecules could have formed from non-biological material with the input of some form of energy. Great efforts have been made to test possible energy sources in various environments and to determine whether the abiogenesis of biological molecules is possible. Among all the theories, the one involving hydrothermal vents has recently captured particular attention because it is based on the idea that the reduction of CO2 and the initiation of a proto-metabolism could have occurred by exploiting a life-like thermodynamic disequilibrium on mineral structure that shows structural and compositional similarities with some catalytic centre of enzimes.1&#8211;3Hydrothermal Vent are geological formation generated from the upwelling of geothermal fluids into the ocean, there are two main types of HTV: black smokers (acidic ones) and white smokers (alkaline ones). In the Archean era Alkaline Hydrothermal Vent were generated by the reaction between alkaline (pH 10-11), warm and hydrogen rich fluids with the ocean rich in CO2 (acidic 10-11) and metal ions such as Fe, Ni, Zn, Co, Mn; here at the mixing point a mineral barrier precipitate, composed mainly of iron oxide and hydroxide, green rust and iron sulphide. Across this mineral membrane an electrochemical potential difference is generated, because of the disparity in pH and redox species between the inner and outer sides of the vent, this thermodynamic disequilibrium can be dissipated by coupling two opposite reactions: CO2 reduction and H2 oxidation, the two semireaction take place on the opposite sides of the same mineral structure but in two different environments: the first acidic, the second alkaline. 4Electrochemistry applied to the study of the behaviour of mineral materials from hydrothermal vents is a valuable tool because it allows for a precise investigation of the reactivity of material surfaces and correlates it with their electronic structure. 5A hydrothermal vent system can be modelled as a short-circuited fuel cell, with a continuous flow of reactants to the electrodes. These electrodes are made of the material that forms the barrier and are located in two different environments: the first electrode functions as a cathode for the reduction of CO2 in an acidic environment, while the second functions as an anode for the oxidation of hydrogen (or other molecules) in an alkaline environment. An electric current is recorded between the two short-circuited electrodes. This coupling of reactions can be represented in an Evans diagram, analogous to a corrosion process.Figure 1. Evans diagram in various conditionFigure 2. Short circuited fuel cell model of AHTVIn our laboratory, we developed a technique for synthesizing Mackinawite (FeSm) and Violarite (FeNi2S4). The samples have been characterized using spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrochemical methods. Using these materials, we have prepared electrodes for testing. A series of electrolysis experiments have demonstrated that these materials can electrochemically reduce CO2 at negative potentials as -1.2 V, producing formic acid, methanol, and carbon monoxide. The efficiency of this reaction decreases significantly when less extreme potentials are applied.&#160;Figure 3. Production of formic acid and methanol during a potentiostatic electrolysis on Mackinawite or Violarite.The behaviour of the electrodes was studied by recording Tafel plots (log(I) vs E) and creating an Evans diagram. This diagram illustrates the operational conditions of pH, catalytic material, and reaction environment under which it is possible to couple the CO2 reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions effectively. Subsequently, the short-circuited fuel cell was constructed, allowing for the measurement of the current flow (which is proportional to the reaction rate and indicates the cell's polarity) and the electric potential at which the coupled reactions occur.The results indicate that once the short-circuited fuel cell is assembled, in the absence of reactants and without a pH difference between the two compartments, no current is registered, suggesting that no reaction is occurring. However, upon introducing the CO2 and H2 reactants into their respective compartments, a pH gradient (6.5 vs 8.8) is established. Under these conditions, a reaction current is observed, with its direction indicating reduction at the pole containing CO2 and oxidation at the pole with H2. The potential at which this coupling occurs, on the synthesized metal sulphides materials, is -0.03 V vs SHE (@ pH 6.5), a value too positive to promote the CO2 reduction reaction. The limiting factor in this setup is the anodic reaction, so other conditions have been tested for improving the catalytic activity of the anode, changing electrolyte composition and pH, flux of reactant and even the composition of the electrode itself. For example, using platinum as the anode (a material known for its catalytic properties in reactions involving hydrogen), a coupling potential of -0.44 V is observed, a value within the range where the reduction reaction of CO2 at the cathode can occur.This approach to measurement and interpretation of Alkaline Hydrothermal Vent functioning represents, in our opinion, a groundbreaking development in the field of studies on this topic. The future challenge lies in identifying the optimal operational conditions that accurately simulate the real environment of an alkaline hydrothermal vent on the Archean ocean floor, capable of facilitating a spontaneous reduction reaction of CO2.References1.Russell, M.

The electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2-ERR) holds tremendous potential as a key approach for achieving carbon neutrality by harnessing renewable resources. However, the current state of CO2-ERR encounters challenges in terms of efficiency and selectivity. Overcoming these obstacles requires the development of a robust electrocatalyst capable of enhancing process efficiency and improving selectivity towards desired products. In recent years, 2D materials have garnered significant attention as efficient catalysts. Among them, MXene stands out of high interest due to unique multilayered structure and presence of surface functional moieties. The MXene material offers high electrical conductivity, versatile surface chemistry, and tunable interface designs. This comprehensive review explores the utilization of MXene-based catalysts for CO2-ERR into valuable products. It covers fundamental aspects of electrochemical conversion, including CO2 adsorption on MXene Ti3C2Tx, the mechanism of CO2-ERR on MXene (Mo2CS2) single-atom catalysts, applications, synthesis methods of MXene production, and future prospects. Additionally, the review highlights the significance of modern artificial intelligence techniques, particularly machine learning, in screening and activating CO2, making it a pioneering scientific endeavor.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value‐added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single‐atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push‐pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of ‐CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron‐donating group (‐CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron‐withdrawing groups (‐CN, ‐COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR), a pivotal process converting CO2 into high-value products, plays a crucial role in advancing objectives of carbon neutrality. Within various catalysts, copper-based electrocatalysts hold a unique position as they demonstrate a remarkable aptitude for producing high-carbon (C2 + ) products. Notably, the well-established Cu+ sites exhibit robust C-C coupling capabilities, particularly in the synthesis of C2H4 products. However, the challenge lies in maintaining the stability of oxide-derived copper under the negative potential operating conditions. In light of this, we use the ion exchange principle to make Al partially replace Cu-BDC, and then get a dopant by high temperature calcination to prepare Al-doped CuO catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the introduction of oxyphilic Al atoms could induce the redistribution of electrons in the CuO matrix and stabilize the presence of Cu+ in the ECO2RR process. This configuration significantly enhances the catalytic performance of CuO for electrochemically converting CO2 into C2H4. Specifically, the optimized Al-CuO catalyst exhibits a faradaic efficiency for C2H4 (FEC2H4) of ∼ 50 % at −1.377 V vs. RHE, doubling the performance compared to pure CuO. The design and implementation of doping engineering presented in this work propel advancements in the field of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for C2H4 production, offering a crucial avenue for the development of efficient catalysts.

Abstract The utilization of low-energy photons in light-driven reactions is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of solar energy conversion. In nature, photosynthetic organisms use chlorophylls to harvest the red portion of sunlight, which ultimately drives the reduction of CO 2 . However, a molecular system that mimics such function is extremely rare in non-noble-metal catalysis. Here we report a series of synthetic fluorinated chlorins as biomimetic chromophores for CO 2 reduction, which catalytically produces CO under both 630 nm and 730 nm light irradiation, with turnover numbers of 1790 and 510, respectively. Under appropriate conditions, the system lasts over 240 h and stays active under 1% concentration of CO 2 . Mechanistic studies reveal that chlorin and chlorinphlorin are two key intermediates in red-light-driven CO 2 reduction, while corresponding porphyrin and bacteriochlorin are much less active forms of chromophores.

China has identified the synergistic reduction of pollution and carbon emissions as a critical component of its environmental protection and climate mitigation efforts. An assessment of this synergy can provide clarity on the strategic management of both air pollution and carbon emissions. Due to the extensive regional differences in China, the spatial effects of influencing factors on this synergy exhibit variation across different provinces. In this study, the reduction indexes of PM2.5 and CO2 were calculated based on their reduction bases, reduction efforts, and reduction stabilities across provinces. Then, the synergistic reduction effect was assessed using an exponential function with the PM2.5 reduction index as the base and the CO2 reduction index as the exponent. Next, the MGWR model was applied in order to analyze the influencing factors of the synergistic reduction effect, considering natural settings, socioeconomic conditions, and external emission impacts. Finally, the k-means clustering method was utilized to classify provinces into different categories based on the degree of impact of each influencing factor. The results indicated that air circulation, vegetation, tertiary industry ratio, and emission reduction efficiency are major impact indicators that have a positive effect. The topography and emissions from neighboring provinces have a statistically significant negative impact. The spatial influences of different factors exhibit a distribution trend characterized by a high-high cluster and a low-low cluster. A total of 31 provinces are divided into three categories, and suggestions on the corresponding category are proposed, to provide a scientific reference to the synergistic reduction of PM2.5 and CO2.

Exploring inexpensive electrocatalysts that can efficiently and selectively convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels is important to promote carbon neutrality and solve the energy crisis. Current electrocatalysts, such as Cu-based alloys, single-atom catalysts, and dual-atom catalysts, use the d states of metal in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Inspired by this, this work studies CO2 reduction reaction from another approach. Herein, using first principles study, we systematically investigate the prospect of nonmetal (B, C, O and F) doped monolayers g-GaN as electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction. We found that nonmetal doping can effectively regulate the electron distribution and p-band center of the active center (N site), which can adjust the initial adsorption, activation degree, charge transfer amount of CO2, and promote the formation of intermediates. Interestingly, B and C doped systems have better catalytic activity for CH4, with limiting potentials of −0.61 and −0.53 V, respectively. More importantly, F doped system has higher activity and selectivity for CH3OH production and inhibit competitive HER, with lower limiting potentials of −0.60 V. This study provides a new theoretical basis for the design and screening of electrocatalysts with high activity and product selectivity using nonmetal as the active site.

Buildings play a significant role in global carbon emissions, and offer substantial potential for energy savings and emission reduction. This research delves into the Emission Factor Discrepancy (EFD)—the variance in CO2 emission reduction projections obtained by employing either annual or hourly average Emission Factor (EF) for electricity generation. Through two detailed case studies in the Netherlands and incorporating emission data from the Netherlands, Sweden, and France, the study uncovers the potential magnitude and country-specific variability of the EFD. By demonstrating how the energy mix of a country influences the EFD, the research offers valuable insights into the accuracy of emission calculations for different circumstances, particularly in the context of transitioning to renewable energy sources. We have found that countries with energy sources having low load-following capability and low EFs exhibit a large EFD. Whereas, countries with high EFs and large deployment of Photovoltaics (PV) show a notably large EFD on emission reduction related to PV production. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting EFs when evaluating building retrofits in the context of smart city initiatives. This research highlights the need for establishing a uniform framework for calculating carbon emissions associated with retrofitting in buildings in conjunction with the granularity of data and the specific energy mix of a country.

Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is widely considered to be the most promising type of electrolyzer for the practical application of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In MEAs, a square-shaped cross-section in the flow channel is normally adopted, the configuration optimization of which could potentially enhance the performance of the electrolyzer. This paper describes the numerical simulation study on the impact of the flow-channel cross-section shapes in the MEA electrolyzer for CO2RR. The results show that wide flow channels with low heights are beneficial to the CO2RR by providing a uniform flow field of CO2, especially at high current densities. Moreover, the larger the electrolytic cell, the more significant the effect is. This study provides a theoretical basis for the design of high-performance MEA electrolyzers for CO2RR.

This research investigates the variation in the impact of different energy sources on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Japan during the period from January 2019 to March 2023. The results of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model suggest that a 1% increase in energy consumption produced through the photovoltaic (PV) decreases carbon emission by 0.053% in the short-run. Conversely, a 1% increase in coal, oil, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) leads to an increase in CO2 emissions by 0.317%, 0.038%, and 0.214%, respectively. The study also reveals an inverted-U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth, represented by the Nikkei stock index. The research emphasizes the critical need for Japan to prioritize investments and incentives in renewable energy technologies such as the PV systems, which have been demonstrated to effectively reduce CO2 emissions in Japan. This is essential to uphold long-term ecological balance and to proactively support the ongoing reduction in CO2 intensity, a key objective outlined in the Paris Agreement.

The paddy field is a major source of gaseous carbon and nitrogen emissions, and reducing these emissions is of great significance for mitigating greenhouse effects and non-point source pollution in farmland. Biochar, derived from agricultural waste, possesses a stable structure, large specific surface area, abundant pore structures, and surface functional groups. These characteristics could enhance soil physicochemical properties and microbial activity, thereby facilitating the dual goals of increasing crop yield and reducing emissions. Based on numerous studies, this review summarizes the effects of biochar on the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia volatilization (NH3), as well as on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI). It elucidates the mechanism of emission reduction by biochar amendment from the perspective of carbon and nitrogen conversion processes and soil physicochemical and biological properties. Numerous studies showed the application of 5~40 t ha−1 biochar reduced CO2, CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions by 1.64~89.6%, 8.6~89.6%, 10~90%, and 12.27~53%, respectively. A small number of studies found that the application of 5~48 t ha−1 biochar increased CO2, CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions by 12~37%, 19.85~176%, 13~84.23%, and 5.47~70.9%, respectively. Most scholars have found that biochar has varying degrees of emission reduction capabilities in different parts of the world. Therefore, future research directions have been suggested for utilizing biochar to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions in paddy fields.

The humongous increase in carbon emissions in the past few decades presents an environmental challenge to the scientific community. The current study proposes a method of taxation on high-carbon emission fuels. For this purpose, a comparative enviro-economic analysis is carried out on the three most commonly used fuels (gasoline, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)). The speed of the test engine varied from 1800 to 4200 Revolution per Minute (RPM) in increments of 400 RPM. Performance parameters (Brake Power (BP), Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTHE), and Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC)) were measured using a hydro dynamometer. Emission analysis, including Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Unburned Hydrocarbons (HC), and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), was conducted using the TESTO 350 analyzer. The application of Weibull distribution with a 95 % confidence interval, on emission data, explained the adequacy of the data. Among test fuels, CNG emerged as an environment-friendly fuel with an emission reduction of 16, 42, and 43 percent for CO2, CO, and HC in comparison to gasoline. Also, BTHE and BSFC of CNG were better than other alternatives. Moreover, the carbon penalty for CNG fuel showed a price reduction of 32 and 20.8 percent in comparison to gasoline and LPG respectively. The study provides a novel approach to assess the environmental impact of fuels by economic analysis based on emitted carbon quantity. In addition, this very idea is novel in promoting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations (UN) through carbon taxation.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are gases released into the atmosphere from various human activities on earth which cause a greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), methane gas (CH4), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). Carbon gas as the main pollutant is produced from burning oil, coal and other organic fuels. To reduce this negative impact, each country then ratified the Paris Agreement and committed to keeping the temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius. In this regard, each country targets reducing GHG emissions, especially carbon, within a certain period of time. The Indonesian government has set a target to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors by 2030 by 29 percent with its own efforts or up to 41 percent with funding assistance from abroad. In the 41% reduction target, the government hopes to collaborate with developed countries that have high levels of carbon emissions, through a "carbon trading" mechanism. This research explains the implementation of policies to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions using the Edwards III approach. The indicators are Communication, Disposition, Resources and Bureaucratic Structure. The research method used is qualitative, descriptive analysis type. Data collection through literature study. Data was obtained from e-books, journals and articles

Economic activities are important factors for the development of countries. However, many countries give too much importance to the economy without paying attention to the country's environment as a result of ongoing economic activities, such as industrial, electricity production, transportation, and commercial and residential which can cause environmental degradation with the spread of CO2 carbon dioxide emissions. The growth of a financial sector that supports those economic activities is considered the driver of carbon emissions at the macro level. However, Islam teaches Muslims to avoid corruption on earth including those leading to the rise in carbon emissions. This makes Muslim-majority countries have better concern in dealing with carbon emissions. This study aims to analyze the influences of financial institution index (FII) and financial market index (FII) on carbon dioxide emissions in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation member nations. Using the GMM estimator for a panel dataset of 36 countries between 2000 and 2021, this study unravels that the FII significantly increased carbon emissions in OIC countries. In reverse, FMI contributed to the reduction of carbon emissions in OIC countries. This paper recommends the government set regulations for banking sectors to improve eco-friendly credits for the private sector. It is also recommended that the government enrich the issuance of green securities and strengthen the financial market because it is effective in minimizing carbon emissions.

Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has emerged in recent years as a promising decarbonization solution for hard-to-abate industries. Compared to carbon capture and storage (CCS), CCU aims not for the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) but for its use in the production of synthetic fuels, such as synthetic methanol (MeOH). Synthetic MeOH is produced through CO2 hydrogenation, utilizing green hydrogen (H2). Efficient use of CO2 and H2 feedstocks is essential to maximize the carbon reduction potential and energy efficiency of the process. This study performed an optimization analysis on a small-scale, containerized, and portable CO2 hydrogenation unit with a 5 kg MeOH/h production capacity goal, focusing on carbon conversion efficiency (CCE), MeOH yield, H2 consumption, and MeOH purity. The analysis was conducted using Aspen Plus V12. A single-pass model was used first to evaluate an initial reactor design. The reactor was then re-designed according to the results of the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). The model was then expanded to include a recycling loop and the final reactor design was validated, aiming to maximize overall efficiency. The effects of the operational parameters including the reactor inlet temperature, reactor pressure, thermal fluid temperature, and condensation temperature were examined. The model was then further expanded to include the MeOH distillation process, and the effect of the distillation temperature was examined. The final product of the analysis was a fully-defined and optimized unit, achieving an 87.97% CCE and an 84.99% MeOH yield, consuming 1.11 kg H2/h for the production of 5.01 kg MeOH/h of 99.86 wt% purity. This study can provide valuable information and guidelines for designing small-scale, containerized, and portable CO2 hydrogenation units, which can serve as alternative solutions to address issues of H2 production and transportation related to large-scale installations.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a crucial greenhouse gas, and its concentration and spatiotemporal characteristics are among the principal sources of uncertainty in global warming assessments. Satellite remote sensing is a widely adopted, high-accuracy approach for monitoring atmospheric CO2. However, limited swath width and cloud cover significantly reduce satellite observation coverage. This study addresses the temporal changes in CO2 concentration and utilizes a machine learning-based fusion of multiple data sources to generate daily, full-coverage, 0.05° spatial resolution column-averaged CO2 concentration data for China from 2015 to 2020. Ten-fold cross-validation yielded a determination coefficient R2 of 0.97, root mean square error of 0.92 ppm, and mean absolute error of 0.59 ppm. Compared to other datasets, this study's dataset exhibits superior accuracy and spatiotemporal detail. Using the produced CO2 concentration in this study, we conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of CO2 concentrations in China. The results indicate that, in general, the Western region exhibits a higher growth rate in CO2 concentration than the Eastern and Central regions, with areas of lower CO2 concentration experiencing higher growth rates while regions with higher CO2 concentration have lower growth rates. Moreover, the highest increase in CO2 concentration occurred in 2016, with a substantial decrease in CO2 concentration growth observed in 2018. Notably, the reduction in CO2 concentration in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region during the summer is considerably smaller than in other regions, possibly due to atmospheric transport from the Indian Peninsula.

The Carbon Dioxide Enhanced Coalbed Methane (CO2-ECBM) technique significantly enhances clean energy extraction and mitigates climate change. Central to this process is the dynamic evolution of rough fracture networks within coal seams, influencing the migration of CO2 and natural gas. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive, quantitative approach to examining the micro-evolution of these fractures, including fracture roughness, fracture density, fracture touristy, and fracture size, particularly under thermo-hydro-mechanical effects. Addressing this gap, our study introduces an innovative, fractal model for quantitative analysis. This model intricately characterizes fracture networks in terms of number, tortuosity, length, and roughness, integrating them with fluid dynamics affected by external disturbances in CO2-ECBM projects. Upon rigorous validation, the finite element method analysis reveals significant impacts of micro-parameters on permeability and natural gas extraction. For instance, increasing CO2 injection pressure from 4 to 6 MPa changes fracture network density by up to 6.4%. A decrease in fracture density (Df) from 1.6 to 1.5 raises residual gas pressure by 2.7% and coal seam stress by 9.5%, indicating crucial considerations for project stability. Applying the proposed interdisciplinary model to assess CO2 emissions in Australia, it is can be obtained that when Df decreases from 1.6 to 1.5, the total amount of CO2 storage reduces by 17.71%–18.04%. Our results demonstrate the substantial influence of micro-fracture behaviors on CO2-ECBM projects, offering a ground-breaking solution for efficient greenhouse gas reduction and clean energy extraction, with practical implications for the energy sector's sustainability.

The advent of comprehensive genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing (NGS) has unveiled an abundance of potentially actionable genetic aberrations that have shaped our understanding of the cancer biology landscape. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is an enzyme present in the cytosol (IDH1) and mitochondria (IDH2 and IDH3). In the mitochondrion, it catalyzes the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, yielding the production of α-ketoglutarate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as well as carbon dioxide (CO2). In the cytosol, IDH catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate as well as the reverse reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate to isocitrate. These rate-limiting steps in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as the cytoplasmic response to oxidative stress, play key roles in gene regulation, cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. Mutations in the genes encoding IDH1 and IDH2 and, less commonly, IDH3 have been found in a variety of cancers, most commonly glioma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chondrosarcoma, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In this paper, we intend to elucidate the theorized pathophysiology behind IDH isomer mutation, its implication in cancer manifestation, and discuss some of the available clinical data regarding the use of novel IDH inhibitors and their role in therapy.

A three-year beef cow grazing study (2020-2022) was conducted to evaluate the effects of biochar supplementation on grazing cow performance, ruminal fermentation, fecal egg and oocyst count, fecal nutrient composition, and enteric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Each year, forty-eight spring-calving Angus beef cows (BW = 669 &plusmn; 95 kg; mean &plusmn; STD) stratified by BW, were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments. Treatments included either (i) pelleted supplement with biochar (Biochar; 405 g/d) inclusion at 2.2% of DMI or (ii) control pellet (Control; base fiber - no biochar). Twenty-four ha meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) paddocks (8.6% CP, 51.1% TDN) were assigned to each treatment group for the 92-d grazing trial. Enteric CH4 and CO2 emissions were measured using SF6 tracer gas technique. Cow and calf performance, rumen fluid parameters were not (p &gt; 0.05) affected by biochar supplementation. During trial biochar supplementation reduced fecal oocyst (Eimeria spp.) count (p &lt; 0.011; 3.9 vs. 15.0 count/g DM) but increased carbon:nitrogen ratio (p &lt; 0.029; 26.1 vs. 21.3) relative to initial measurements. The enteric methane emission reduction in response to biochar supplementation at 2.2% of DMI, was negligible (~6.0% reduced compared to control).

PurposeThis work presents the development and analysis of a SiO2 composite ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte (SiO2-CILGPE)-based capacitor in air and carbon dioxide (CO2) atmospheres. The effectiveness of the proposed layer as a humidity-sensitive layer has been demonstrated in [1]. Its use as a humidity sensing layer not only stands out among other alternatives due to its sensing performance, but also because of its cost-effectiveness, scalability, and non-toxicity. In this realm, this study exhibits a brief comparison of the impedance characteristics of the proposed device under air and CO2 conditions, aiming to examine a first insight into the impact of CO2 onits electrical behaviour to evaluate its potential use as a relative humidity sensor for planetary research applications, such the ones carried out in Mars for habitability studies.&#160;Methodology Figure 1 illustrates the fabrication process of the SiO2 CILGPE. The fabrication starts by dissolving the host polymers (HPs) in deionised water at 70 &#186;C. Then, a blend of CH&#8323;COONH&#8324; and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide is incorporated and stirred at 70 &#186;C. Afterwards, SiO&#8322; nanoparticles are embedded in the resultant ILGPE using an ultrasound bath until a homogenous mixture is achieved. Finally, the resulting electrolyte is deposited onto the active electrode area using drop-casting and subsequently cured, forming a layer with a thickness of around 600 &#956;m and length and width of 0.4 mm and 1mm, respectively.The humidity sensing performance of the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor was evaluated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique under different humidity conditions at atmospheric pressure. The impedimetric response has been obtained using the impedance module values, while the capacitance response has been calculated using Equation 1:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; C = -&#119885;&#8242;&#8242;/( 2&#120587; &#119891;&#119885;2) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; (Eq. 1)&#160;Where &#119885; and &#119885;&#8242;&#8242; are the module and imaginary part of the impedance, respectively.Furthermore, EIS measurements under air and CO2 conditions at different pressures have been carried out and compared to evaluate its behaviour under a CO2 atmosphere. This evaluation starts with air evacuation until a partial vacuum, reducing the concentration of air. This first part of the process provides information about the impact of pressure variations on the electrical behaviour of the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor under air conditions. Once 0.1 mbar is reached, CO2 is injected in a controlled and gradual manner. This second step stimulates an increase in the internal pressure of the chamber and allows a preliminary analysis of how the quantity of CO2 can impact the impedimetric characteristics of the device. This methodology enables the characterisation of the SiO2-CILGPE-based capacitor under different conditions of pressure and gas composition, thereby providing initial insights into how the presence of different gases affects its performance. The exhibited EIS measurements can be fitted using the equivalent circuit (EC) displayed in Figure 4. The analysis of EIS data from ECs could allow a first insight into the understanding of the impact of CO2 on the sensing mechanism and performance of the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor.&#160;ResultsFigure 2 illustrates the obtained Z and capacitance humidity sensing responses. As can be noticed, the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor reveals changes in two parameters, increasing its reliability compared to other relative humidity sensors in the literature and offering more information that could facilitate the calibration process.Following the analysis of the EIS data, Figure 3 compares the obtained impedance module, phase, and capacitance spectra under air and CO2 atmospheres. It is noticeable that the curves of the three parameters of the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor exhibit the same trend under the presence of both gases, thereby suggesting the SiO2 CILGPE layer could work similarly under air and CO2.Nevertheless, the characterised parameters reveal opposite shifts in response to pressure variations. Firstly, under an air atmosphere, it can be noticed that a reduction in the pressure implies an increase in the impedance module and a decrease in the capacitance. This behaviour could be ascribed to a reduction of the water vapour molecules since reducing the pressure inside the measurement chamber also implies a reduction in the partial pressure of all gases, including water vapour [2]. Reducing the water molecules promotes a decrease in the number of charge carriers within the humidity-sensitive layer and, hence, an increase in the impedance and a decrease in the capacitance. Conversely, under a CO2 atmosphere, the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor depicts an increase in the impedance module values and a reduction in the capacitance when increasing the pressure. This finding might be attributed to the injection of CO2 into the vacuumed chamber. One possible explanation for such phenomena is that introducing CO2 into the chamber increases the pressure, thereby could reduce the water vapour concentration relative to the total gas, promoting a decrease in the relative humidity. Consequently, the obtained impedance spectra suggest that the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor could possess the same response to relative humidity variations under the presence of air and CO2. Further research should focus on investigating and analysing the impact of CO2 presence under different relative humidity levels.&#160;ConclusionsEIS measurements show that, under air and CO2 conditions, the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor exhibits similar impedance, phase, and capacitance curve trends, thereby suggesting the SiO2 CILGPE layer could operate following similar electrical behaviours under CO2. Additionally, this comparison shows that a reduction in the relative humidity could imply the same response under air and CO2 atmospheres. Therefore, it might suggest that CO2 does not alter the dominant sensing mechanism.Consequently, this work provides first insights into the possible potential of a non-toxic, cost-effective alternative based on a SiO2 CILGPE as a sensing layer for humidity sensing in CO2 atmospheres.AcknowledgementsThis work has been supported by the projects TED2021-131552B-C22 and PID2021-126719OB-C42.References[1]&#160; Cede&#241;o Mata, M.; Orpella, A.; Dominguez-Pumar, M.; Bermejo, S.

Abstract Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) reduces the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in seawater, leading to atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Here we report laboratory experiments and a field-trial of alkalinity enhancement through addition of magnesium hydroxide to wastewater and its subsequent discharge to the coastal ocean. In wastewater, a 10% increase of average alkalinity (+0.56 mmol/kg) led to a 74% reduction in aqueous CO 2 (−0.41 mmol/kg) and pH increase of 0.4 units to 7.78 (efficiency 0.73 molCO 2 /mol alkalinity). The alkalinization signal was limited to within a few metres of the ocean discharge, evident as 27.2 μatm reduction in CO 2 partial pressure and 0.017 unit pH increase, and was consistent with rapid dilution of the alkali-treated wastewater. While this proof of concept field trial did not achieve CDR due to its small scale, it demonstrated the potential of magnesium hydroxide addition to wastewater as a CDR solution.

Based on the double-carbon target, the agricultural sector has implemented the concept of being green and synergistically promoted pollution and carbon reduction. Positioned as a novel financial paradigm, green finance places greater emphasis on environmental stewardship compared to its traditional counterparts. This focus enhances resource allocation efficiency, thereby achieving the goal of reducing pollution and carbon emissions. To research the influence of green finance on agricultural pollution and carbon reduction, this study leverages panel data spanning 2011 to 2021 from 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across China. It employs the fixed-effect model and mediating-effect model. The findings reveal that: (1) Green finance exerts a notable influence on reducing both pollution and carbon emissions in agriculture, with the latter showing a more pronounced effect. (2) Regional disparities exist in green finance, affecting agricultural pollution and carbon reduction. (3) By fostering technological innovation and optimizing industrial frameworks, green finance emerges as a catalyst for curbing surface pollution and carbon dioxide emissions in agriculture. On this basis, relevant suggestions are put forward to provide policy insights for improving the green financial system, which will help further promote carbon and pollution reduction.

At the 75th United Nations General Assembly, China committed to peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. In response, the national standard “General Specification for Building Energy Conservation and Utilization of Renewable Energy” has been adopted across 20 provinces and cities in seven major regions, including North China, Northeast China, and South China. These regions have implemented stringent energy-saving and emission reduction reviews and quota requirements. Despite this, there is limited research on comprehensive life cycle carbon emission calculations and carbon reduction designs. This study addresses this gap by focusing on economically developed regions with high population density and substantial energy-saving potential, specifically targeting the warm winter and hot summer regions of China. Using a commercial building in Shenzhen as a case study, we established a carbon emission accounting model based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. We calculated carbon emissions during the material phase using the project’s bill of quantities and relevant carbon emission factors. Additionally, we used the CEEB 2023 software to design energy-saving and emission reduction solutions for the building. Our comparative analysis reveals that the new design reduces the carbon emissions of the case study building by 13.5%. This reduction not only mitigates the environmental impact of construction but also contributes to the fight against the greenhouse effect, supporting the broader goal of sustainable development.

Human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction between two achiral molecules – water and carbon dioxide – to yield the achiral product carbonic acid through a zinc hydroxide intermediate. We have previously shown that a zinc hydride, instead of a hydroxide, can be generated in this enzyme to create a catalyst for the reduction of aryl ketones. Dialkyl ketones are more challenging to reduce, and the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with two alkyl groups that are similar in size and electronic properties, is a particularly challenging transformation to achieve with high activity and selectivity. Here, we show that hCAII, as well as a double variant of it, catalyzes the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with high yields and enantioselectivities, even when the two alkyl groups are similar in size. We also show that variants of hCAII catalyze the site‐selective reduction of one ketone over the other in an unsymmetrical aliphatic diketone. Computational docking of a dialkyl ketone to the double variant containing the zinc hydride provides insights into the origins of the reactivity of various substrates and the high enantioselectivity of the transformations and show how a confined environment can control the enantioselectivity of an abiological intermediate

Integrating carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology into an integrated energy system (IES) can reduce its carbon emissions and enhance its low-carbon performance. However, the full CCS of flue gas displays a strong coupling between lean and rich liquor as carbon dioxide liquid absorbents. Its integration into IESs with a high penetration level of renewables results in insufficient flexibility and renewable curtailment. In addition, integrating split-flow CCS of flue gas facilitates a short capture time, giving priority to renewable energy. To address these limitations, this paper develops a carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) method, into which storage tanks for lean and rich liquor and a two-stage power-to-gas (P2G) system with multiple utilizations of hydrogen including a fuel cell and a hydrogen-blended CHP unit are introduced. The CCUS is integrated into an IES to build an electricity–heat–hydrogen–gas IES. Accordingly, a deep low-carbon economic optimization strategy for this IES, which considers stepwise carbon trading, coal consumption, renewable curtailment penalties, and gas purchasing costs, is proposed. The effects of CCUS, the two-stage P2G system, and stepwise carbon trading on the performance of this IES are analyzed through a case-comparative analysis. The results show that the proposed method allows for a significant reduction in both carbon emissions and total operational costs. It outperforms the IES without CCUS with an 8.8% cost reduction and a 70.11% reduction in carbon emissions. Compared to the IES integrating full CCS, the proposed method yields reductions of 6.5% in costs and 24.7% in emissions. Furthermore, the addition of a two-stage P2G system with multiple utilizations of hydrogen further amplifies these benefits, cutting costs by 13.97% and emissions by 12.32%. In addition, integrating CCUS into IESs enables the full consumption of renewables and expands hydrogen utilization, and the renewable consumption proportion in IESs can reach 69.23%.

Abstract. Accurate and continuous measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are essential for climate change research and monitoring of emission reduction efforts. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2/3) satellites have been deployed to measure the column-averaged CO2 dry air mixing ratio (XCO2) with very high precision. Although cloudy measurements are screened out, nearby clouds can still cause retrieval biases because the forward one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer (RT) model used in the OCO retrieval algorithm does not account for the scattering induced by clouds in the vicinity of the OCO-2/3 footprints. These biases, referred to as the three-dimensional (3D) effects, can be quantified effectively using 3D-RT calculations, but these are computationally expensive, especially for hyperspectral applications (e.g., OCO-2/3). To reduce the prohibitive computational demands of 3D-RT radiance simulations across all three OCO spectral bands, this paper employs a linear approximation with two metrics (called slope and intercept) for each of the OCO bands that represent the 3D-RT perturbations on the OCO-2 spectra and accelerate the radiative transfer by a factor of 100. This is implemented by the Education and Research 3D Radiation Transfer Toolbox for OCO (EaR3T-OCO). EaR3T-OCO estimates OCO-2 satellite radiances using all available footprint-level data and imagery from the Aqua satellite, which orbits in close proximity to the OCO-2 satellite. EaR3T-OCO can calculate 3D-RT spectral perturbations for any OCO-2 footprint. These calculations can be used to spectrally adjust the OCO-2 radiance measurements with scene-dependent EaR3T-OCO perturbation calculations prior to the actual retrieval to undo cloud vicinity effects in the radiance spectra, which can subsequently be processed with the standard OCO-2 retrieval code. We find that this adjustment largely mitigates XCO2 retrieval biases in proximity to clouds over land – the first physics-based correction of 3D-RT effects on OCO-2/3 retrievals. Although the accelerated 3D-RT radiance adjustment step is faster than full 3D-RT calculations for all OCO spectral bands, it still requires at least as much computational effort as the XCO2 retrieval itself. To bypass 3D-RT altogether, the slope and intercept metrics are parameterized as a function of the weighted cloud distance of a footprint and several other scene parameters, all of which can be derived directly from Aqua-MODIS imagery. While this method is fastest and thus feasible for operational use, it requires careful validation for various surface and atmospheric conditions. For the case we analyzed, both the 3D-RT calculation method and the parametric bypass method successfully corrected XCO2 biases, which exceeded 2 ppm at the footprint level, and reached up to 0.7 ppm in the regional average. We find that the biases depend most strongly on the cloud field morphology and surface reflectance, but also on secondary factors such as aerosol layers and sun-sensor geometry.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an innovative class of crystalline porous polymers composed of light elements such as C, N, O, etc., linked by covalent bonds. The distinctive properties of COFs, including designable building blocks, large specific surface area, tunable pore size, abundant active sites, and remarkable stability, have led their widespread applications in electrocatalysis. In recent years, COF‐based electrocatalysts have made remarkable progress in various electrocatalytic fields, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. This review begins with an introduction to the design and synthesis strategies employed for COF‐based electrocatalysts. These strategies include heteroatom doping, metalation of COF and building monomers, encapsulation of active sites within COF pores, and the development of COF‐based derived materials. Subsequently, a systematic overview of the recent advancements in the application of COF‐based catalysts in electrocatalysis is presented. Finally, the review discusses the main challenges and outlines possible avenues for the future development of COF‐based electrocatalysts.

Efforts to combat global warming and energy-related issues involve the solar-driven reduction of CO2 into worthy fuels and substances. However, the stable nature of CO2 demands high energy input for transformation. CO2 reduction using semiconductor materials activated by sunlight is gaining attention for its eco-friendly and economically viable nature. Despite progress, many solar-active catalysts for CO2 photoreduction encounter challenges like low efficiency and uncontrollable selectivity. The commonly used rare earth oxide ceria (CeO2) has low sunlight absorption, necessitating changes such as metal-nonmetal doping oxygen vacancy creation, the addition of co-catalysts, and the development of binary, ternary, Z-scheme, and S-scheme heterostructures to improve its use in visible light. Although there has been considerable research on CeO2 modifications, there is a lack of comprehensive study regarding their characteristics and the precise photochemical reduction mechanisms. This review aims to bridge this gap by thoroughly examining recent breakthroughs in CeO2-based photo reductants for CO2 reduction. It focuses on the synthetic techniques of photocatalysts and CO2 reduction processes, assesses photoactivity enhancement strategies, investigates underlying mechanisms, and addresses the factors influencing CO2 reduction, efficiencies and selectivity. Finally, the review concludes by offering insights into future challenges and prospects, guiding upcoming research toward sustainable and efficient CO2 reduction strategies.

Carbon dioxide emissions are among the most influential causes of global warming, and the recovery, capture, and comprehensive utilization of CO 2 are the keys to carbon emissions reduction. High-porosity foam concrete was prepared using CaO as the alkali activator, and H 2 O 2 as the foaming agent. Based on a single-factor experiment and response surface analysis, the best preparation conditions for foam concrete were obtained (water-to-cement ratio 0.4, alkali excitation dosage 10.73%, foaming agent dosage 8.26%). The porous material prepared under the optimal process conditions can achieve a CO 2 sequestration performance of 91.59 kg/m 3 , and the actual sequestration capacity is consistent with the theoretical prediction value of 90.89 kg/m 3 . Mechanistic analysis shows that the precarbonation hydration products of foam concrete are mainly C-S-H gel, Ca(OH) 2 , and hydrotalcite-like compounds, which bond the slag particles together to form a three-dimensional spatially firmly connected structure. This study provides a reference for the application of alkaline solid waste materials in the field of carbon sequestration.

Subsurface gas storage refers to the practice of storing natural gas or other gases in underground reservoirs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring a stable and reliable supply of energy, especially during periods of high demand or supply disruptions. This work collectively highlights the significance of the microscopic and mesoscopic reservoir simulation techniques developed for subsurface gas storage. Specific technology progresses are demonstrated for a better storage of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which meets well with the current focus on carbon reduction. In particular, molecular dynamics simulations can provide insight for the microscopic mechanisms affecting the adsorption and leakage of stored gas. Pore-network model generated using the advanced algorithm can determine the geological scenario for further flow and transport simulations.

Fractional carbon dioxide (AFCO2) laser therapy is used for treating pathological scarring, but the clinical outcomes are variable and the mechanisms of scar reduction poorly understood. We investigated the mechanisms underpinning efficacy of AFCO2 laser therapy, performing single-cell RNA sequencing in skin biopsies from patients with hypertrophic scars after AFCO2 laser therapy. Patients with younger scars (Good Responder, GR, <6 years from healing) had better scar reduction than patients with older scars (Poor Responder, PR, >6 years from healing) by various measures of scarring. scRNAseq analysis revealed that genes enriched in GR were associated with extracellular matrix and structure organisation (COL14A1, POSTN, SPARC); whereas genes enriched in PR were related to enhanced immune responses (IL-12, MSTN, HLA-DQA). The groups had distinct intercellular communication networks and differentiation trajectories after AFCO2, with regenerative Mesenchymal fibroblasts associated with a good response and inflammatory Secretory Papillary and Inflammatory Fibroblasts with a poor response.

Algae catalyze half of the global solar powered reduction of carbon dioxide to organic molecules. While this organic synthesis shapes genomes of heterotrophic microbiota globally, many corresponding structures remain elusive. We show that diatoms release a mannan polyelectrolyte selecting for bacteria with a specifically adapted enzymatic cascade. NMR spectroscopy, chromatography, automated glycan assembly and enzymatic dissection resolved the structure of a C6 sulfated α-1,3-mannan with exceptional simplicity for a sulfated polysaccharide from algae. Biochemical, physiological and structural analyses demonstrated that some bacteria can hydrolyze this mannan with a cascade of just four enzymes. Circumnavigation metagenome data revealed corresponding genes in Atlantic, Pacific, Southern and Indian Ocean surface waters. We show that this sulfated mannan may exert substantial selection pressure on marine microbiota around the globe.

Abstract Biomass gasification technology is increasingly employed as an environmentally friendly energy source, primarily due to its minimal impact on the environment and its ability to mitigate pollution. This technology excels in producing gas with exceptionally high hydrogen content, making it a valuable source for both fuel and energy carriers. Hydrogen (H 2 ), renowned for its stability and lack of detrimental environmental effects, holds great significance in various applications related to energy utilization and sustainability. In the current work, wood sawdust was utilized as the biomass feedstock for syngas production. The research focused on examining the impact of introducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) gases into the Gibbs reactors. The steam gasification process was modeled by the ASPEN Plus software, allowing for comprehensive analysis and simulation of the gasification reactions. According to the obtained results, the modeling performed in this study demonstrates good predictive capability when compared to the experimental data. It was shown that when the ratio of CO 2 to biomass (C/B) increases, the MFR (mass flow rates) of H 2 as well as CH 4 decrease, whereas the flow rates of CO 2 and carbon monoxide (CO) increase. These findings indicate the influence of the C/B ratio on the distribution of different gases within the gasification process. The reduction in MFR of hydrogen when transitioning from C/B = 0 to C/B = 1 in modes a and b is quantified as 17.51 % and 16.39 %, respectively. These percentages represent the magnitude of the decrease in hydrogen MFR for each specific mode when comparing two carbon dioxide to biomass ratios. When the CH 4 to biomass (M/B) ratio increases, the mass flow rates of H 2 exhibit a consistent upward trend, while the MFR of CO 2 displays a descending form. Specifically, when in the Gibbs reactor, M/B rises from 0 to 1 for modes a and b, the mass flow rates of H 2 experience significant increases of 265 % and 243 %, respectively. These findings underscore the direct relationship between the M/B ratio and hydrogen production, highlighting the potential for enhanced hydrogen yields with higher M/B ratios in the studied modes.

Green finance, in contrast to traditional finance, has a close relationship with the environment and offers several advantages. This is why the study tries to illustrate how green financing affects environmental protection and evaluates its contribution to reducing environmental pollution. Green finance is an innovative method of funding with the goal of preserving the environment. It is crucial, widely discussed, and has caught the interest of many academics. They include programs that stimulate spending on initiatives aimed at minimizing adverse environmental effects. This study highlights the importance of green finance in environmental protection for the 36 OECD countries for the 11 years from 2010 to 2021. Panel data is used to derive results by applying models such as OLS, OLS Robust, Fixed effect, Random effects, and GMM. Empirical results according to the GMM method show that green finance has a positive impact on environmental protection, so the growth of green finance affects the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.

Converting dilute CO2 source into value-added chemicals and fuels is a promising route to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission, but integrating electrocatalysis with CO2 capture still faced marked challenges. Herein, we show that a self-healing metal–organic macrocycle functionalized as an electrochemical catalyst to selectively produce methane from flue gas and air with the lowest applied potential so far (0.06 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) through an enzymatic activation fashion. The capsule emulates the enzyme' pocket to abstract one in situ-formed CO2-adduct molecule with the commercial amino alcohols, forming an easy-to-reduce substrate-involving clathrate to combine the CO2 capture with electroreduction for a thorough CO2 reduction. We find that the self-healing system exhibited enzymatic kinetics for the first time with the Michaelis–Menten mechanism in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and maintained a methane Faraday efficiency (FE) of 74.24% with a selectivity of over 99% for continuous operation over 200 h. A consecutive working lab at 50 mA·cm–2, in an eleven-for-one (10 h working and 1 h healing) electrolysis manner, gives a methane turnover number (TON) of more than 10,000 within 100 h. The integrated electrolysis with CO2 capture facilitates the thorough reduction of flue gas (ca. 13.0% of CO2) and first time of air (ca. 400 ppm of CO2 to 42.7 mL CH4 from 1.0 m3 air). The new self-healing strategy of molecular electrocatalyst with an enzymatic activation manner and anodic shifting of the applied potentials provided a departure from the existing electrochemical catalytic techniques.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on Cu occurs via two tandem steps, i.e., the CO2-to-CO conversion and the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR). Thus, Cu-catalyzed CO2RR on Cu is, in fact, coelectrolysis of CO2 and CO, which makes the impact of interfacial CO2 on the CORR a relevant factor in determining the overall CO2RR performance. In this work, we report the surprising observation that the effect of interfacial CO2 on the formation rate of C2+ products depends on the nature of cations in the electrolyte, i.e., beneficial with K+ and Cs+ while inhibitory with Li+ and Na+. Density functional theory calculations indicate that interfacial CO2δ− affects electrode-mediated reactions in two distinct modes with opposite effects, i.e., a general inhibitory effect of CO2δ− as an interfacial negatively charged species and a cation-specific promoting effect via direct CO2-cation interactions. The relative contributions of these two competing effects determine the overall impact of CO2 on the CORR. Furthermore, analysis of isotopologue distributions of products in the coelectrolysis of mixtures of 13CO/12CO2 reveals the influence of cations on the multiple steps of the CO2RR.

Abstract The aim of this research is to conduct an objective and predictive evaluation of Azerbaijan's economic growth from 1997 to 2022. Since Azerbaijan is a significant exporter and producer of energy resources, its economic growth is substantially influenced by the remarkable advancements in oil and gas extraction and production since the early 2000s. Methodologically, we have designed several models to ascertain the influence and impact of the following explanatory factors-oil reserves, natural gas reserves, net trade, current account balance, inflation rate, unemployment rate, interest rate and carbon dioxide emissions - on the economic growth rate. The study utilised a combination of uni- and multi-factorial linear regression techniques, with accuracy and robustness testing conducted on all eight models. Research hypotheses were tested and a predictive analysis was implemented and evaluated over the studied period. Our findings demonstrate that the growth of Azerbaijan's economy is positively impacted by the dynamics and development of energy product trade, particularly in oil. As a result, GDP increased by an average of 2.50%. It is also confirmed that inflation and unemployment have a negative impact which unavoidably leads to instability and an economic downturn. In contrast, the robustness indicators (namely, RMSE, MAE and MAPE) could assess the predictive analysis of economic growth. The validated, low values further endorse the credibility of the eight models in accurately forecasting the economic growth rate throughout the studied period. The study disproves the existence of a positive correlation between GDP and the quantity of carbon dioxide emissions. However, it has been demonstrated that Azerbaijan is taking significant measures to achieve its environmental objectives. These measures include the implementation of taxation, a reduction in CO 2 emissions by up to 55% by 2030, and a shift towards renewable energy sources. Our research aims to enhance the utilisation of renewable energy resources, increase the efficiency of the domestic energy infrastructure and implement measures to moderate high levels of unemployment and inflation, thus ensuring sustained economic growth in Azerbaijan.

Abstract This research investigates the application of Extended Coherent Flame Model‐3 Zones (ECFM‐3Z) to assess the performance and emissions of rapeseed oil methyl ester (ROME). Experimental tests were carried out using a Lombardini 3 LD 350 model single‐cylinder diesel engine, at 1600–3000 rpm with 200 rpm speed increments, under full load conditions. For numerical analysis, STAR‐CD/ESICE software was employed. Methyl Oleate (C 19 H 36 O 2 ) was predicted as the surrogate biodiesel based on Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis and average mass calculation. Notably, the numerical analysis revealed a remarkable similarity in brake power between the experimental and computational investigations. In the range of 2400–3000 rpm, the biodiesel's performance exhibited a maximum deviation of 5%, primarily attributed to pumping, thermal, and friction losses. In terms of emissions, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions were consistent with the findings of the experimental study, with a maximum disparity of 10%. However, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions ranged from 57% to 65% lower than those observed in the experimental study, while nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions exhibited a reduction of 63% to 84%. In contrast, oxygen (O 2 ) emissions were notably higher, ranging from 93% to 117% compared to the experimental study, and exhaust temperatures were elevated by 33% to 49% in comparison to the experimental results.

Density functional theory calculations employing a hybrid implicit/explicit solvation method were used to demonstrate that an electro-organocatalyst designed in our previous work for reducing CO2 to formaldehyde could also be capable of coupling formaldehyde to form long chain aldehydes. The catalytic activity is enabled by an electron-rich vicinal enediamine (>N–C═C–N<) backbone that activates formaldehyde by reversing the polarity on the carbon atom, enabling it to act as a nucleophile in the subsequent aldol addition step. The catalyst then enables reductive dehydroxylation of the aldol addition product by facilitating outer-sphere electron transfer. The optimal pH as well as the limiting potential and formaldehyde concentration are identified and related to the kinetic balance between several rate limiting steps. Finally, the optimal conditions for coupling with the CO2 reduction cycle are discussed, demonstrating that the electro-organocatalyst is capable of efficiently converting CO2 into aldehyde products with a turnover frequency (per carbon atom) on the order of 0.1–1 s–1.

Fruit CO2 exchange at the time of fruit setting period was evaluated on mature cv. 'Jonagold' apple trees after 4 days artificial shading with 90 % photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) reduction and after NAA 15 ppm and BA 50 ppm applied immediately after the end of shading. Light reduction which accelerated fruitlets abscission very quickly had a depressive effect on fruits CO2 dark respiration rate (Rd) and gross assimilation rate (Ag) 3 days after the end of shading. Similarly, reduced Rd and less negative net CO2 assimilation rate (A) was recorded on fruitlets 7 days after NAA and BA application what is explained as a diminished metabolism of fruits starting with abscission. The fruitlets from shaded trees, which did not tend to abscission any more, showed an enhanced Rd and more negative A on 7th or 8th day after the end of shading. Ethylene evolution from fruits 2nd and 7th day after NAA 15 ppm application was enhanced comparing to control fruits. BA 50 ppm enhanced ethylene evolution on 2nd day after spraying, however on 7th day the ethylene evolution was lower than in control fruits. Healthy, not to drop inclined fruitlets retained on trees 7 days after shading treatment, showed stronger fruit ethylene production.

Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) is a waste processing method that can be used as co-firing in the cement industry. Currently, the Cilacap RDF Plant is one of the RDFs successfully operating in Indonesia, with a machine capacity of up to 200 tons/day. This success has encouraged many local governments to build RDF facilities to handle waste. The research aims to propose alternative funding scenarios for the development of RDF so that it can be applied in other places. Not all regions have the same opportunities as RDF Cilacap, where investment financing includes the construction of RDF facilities and machinery covered by many stakeholders. This study also calculates the potential for reducing CO2 emissions with the RDF plant and estimates the potential carbon trading value from the reduction in CO2 emissions. The analysis method in alternative scenario studies uses investment project analysis such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), NPV, IRR, Profitability Index, Payback Period, Discounted Payback Period, and IPCC 2006 to calculate CO2 emission reductions. The potential for reducing CO2 emissions in this study is calculated by comparing the value of CO2 produced if waste is disposed of in a landfill (open dumping) and the waste is processed into RDF. The research results show that the third scenario is suitable and feasible for regions planning to build an RDF Factory. It is recommended that the Central Government bear the responsibility for the RDF Factory building infrastructure and the investors or third parties take responsibility for the machinery. The potential for reducing CO2 emissions with the existence of the RDF Plant Cilacap for 20 years is 231,944.86 tons. If multiplied by the average price in the secondary market, IDR 69,600 (USD 4.45), the potential for obtaining funds is IDR 16,143 million, or equivalently, we calculate it in present value to IDR 5,284 million.

The current scientific literature predominantly focuses on pilot-scale studies concerning the effectiveness of membrane covers in reducing gas emissions during cattle manure composting. Our study centers on the application of a leading market commercial membrane cover (ePTE-TEXcomm) and a locally manufactured one (ProfiCover®) at industrial processing levels, evaluating their efficacy in mitigating gas emission during the fifth day of the thermophilic phase. Taking into account material inhomogeneities, work environment impact, and efficiency, the results are characteristic of industrial-scale processes rarely discussed in the scientific literature. Our results, obtained with a portable gas sampler and FTIR spectroscopy measurements using corresponding standards, indicate that ePTE-TEXcomm manifested a reduction of 90.8% for NH3 and 59.6% for CO2. CH4 emissions increased, suggesting their potential entrapment. N2O and propane equivalent experienced reductions of 23.1% and 44.8%, respectively. On the other hand, ProfiCover® presented emission reductions for NH3 and CO2 of 93.3% and 85.9%, respectively. CH4, contrasting with ePTE-TEXcomm, showed a significant reduction of 55.6%. N2O and propane equivalent followed with reductions of 56.7% and 84.5%, respectively. All of this divergence in performance implies a potential trade-off in emission reduction efficacy between the covers. Knowledge sharing between researchers and industry partners is key to translating these technologies into widespread adoption.

Carbon-based materials have been widely applied for pollutant removal relying on their rich pore structure, functional groups, chemical stability, and expandability. However, the traditional manufacturing process of carbon materials based on organic compounds pyrolysis is high energy-consuming and high-emission, which is not conducive to addressing the climate crisis and achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. Molten salt electrolysis technology enables the direct capture and reduction of CO2 to produce solid carbon, resulting in significant environmental benefits while achieving carbon emissions reduction. The molten salt also has a purification function, enabling the production of high-purity carbon materials. The kinetics of the electrochemical reduction process can be easily controlled, and the co-reduction of multiple elements provides convenience for the in-situ optimization of carbon material structure and the expansion of its applications. Therefore, this review focuses on the thermodynamics & kinetics processes of molten salt capture and electrochemical reduction of CO2 to prepare carbon materials. It further reviews the recent research progress on the preparation of carbon materials for pollutant removal based on molten salt electrochemical processes for the first time. Finally, we analyze the advantages and challenges of the current molten salt electrochemical processes and offers prospects for future research directions.

The major challenge in the current context of a rising world’s energy demand is to limit the global temperature increase for mitigating climate change. This goal requires a large reduction of CO2 emissions, mainly produced by power generation and industrial processes using fossil fuels. In this study, a novel methodology for K2CO3-doped Li4SiO4 sorbents production for CO2 capture at high temperature was adopted based on the Design of Experiments (DoE). Different synthesis (temperature and K2CO3 content) and adsorption conditions (sorption temperature and CO2 concentration) were systematically tested by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to obtain predictive models of CO2 uptake and Li4SiO4 conversion. The results of RSM analysis evidenced a maximum adsorption capacity of 196.4 mg/g for a sorbent produced at 600 °C and with 36.9 wt% of K2CO3, tested at 500 °C and 4 vol% of CO2. Whereas at 50 vol% of CO2, the best uptake of 295.6 mg/g was obtained with a sorbent synthesized at 600 °C, containing less K2CO3 (17.1 wt%) and tested at higher temperature (662 °C). The obtained results highlight that K2CO3-doped Li4SiO4 sorbents can be tailored for maximizing CO2 capture at different operating conditions, making them suitable for use in industrial processes.

Nanoparticles in wastewater treatment offer sustainable, efficient removal of persistent pollutants, with minimal resource usage and reusability. This study examines the reusability of immobilized iron‑copper nanoparticles (iFeCu) for sewage treatment. The effect of the regeneration condition of iFeCu including the regeneration time and temperature on the performance of iFeCu for sewage treatment was investigated. Moreover, a soft sensor model, namely principal component analysis discrimination analysis ensemble least squares support vector regression (PCA-DA-E-LSSVR) model was developed to predict the performance of iFeCu, and an online performance of the model was studied to evaluate its accuracy. Investigating regeneration conditions like time and temperature, it was found that iFeCu regenerated in 1 mol (M) sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at 40 °C for 5 h performed comparably to that regenerated at 60 °C for 15 h. Higher regeneration temperatures (>40 °C) decreased carbon dioxide and monoxide emissions but reduced ammonia (NH3) removal by ∼22 %. Shorter regeneration times (<5 h) decreased Na2CO3-iFeCu interaction, leading to an ∼11 % NH3 removal reduction. The correlation coefficient, R2 value of 0.8514 was obtained for the proposed PCA-DA-E-LSSVR model. Overall, the developed model well-fits the nonlinear data in sewage treatment and provides acceptable ranges of online performance results.

Artificial photosynthesis is an effective way of converting CO2 into fuel and high value-added chemicals. However, the sluggish interfacial electron transfer and adsorption of CO2 at the catalyst surface strongly hamper the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction. Here, we report a photocathode attaching zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) onto a ZnTe surface to mimic an aquatic leaf featuring stoma and chlorophyll for efficient photoelectrochemical conversion of CO2 into CO. ZIF-8 possessing high CO2 adsorption capacity and diffusivity has been selected to enrich CO2 into nanocages and provide a large number of catalytic active sites. ZnTe with high light-absorption capacity serves as a light-absorbing layer. CO2 molecules are collected in large nanocages of ZIF-8 and delivered to the ZnTe surface. As evidenced by scanning electrochemical microscopy, the interface can effectively boost interfacial electron transfer kinetics. The ZIF-8/ZnTe photocathode with unsaturated Zn–Nx sites exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for CO production of 92.9% and a large photocurrent of 6.67 mA·cm–2 at −2.48 V (vs Fc/Fc+) in a nonaqueous electrolyte at AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW·cm–2).

In this study, hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant-modified copper molybdate (CuMoO4) nanorod material was synthesized for the electrocatalysis of CO2 in a H cell reactor where CMO3 (CuMoO4 with the 0.5 g loading of CTAB surfactant) helped the formation of acetaldehyde with Faradaic efficiency of 41%. The long positive alkyl chain of CTAB directs the growth of copper molybdate nanomaterial in a three-dimensional nanorod shape, and this rodlike structure of copper molybdate provides exposed surface area for the successful electrochemical reduction of CO2. The production of C3 products like n-propanol and iso-propanol was successful due to the tremendous conductive character of the Cu element in CuMoO4. Copper molybdate (CMO3), the smallest particle size among all the compositions, performed extremely well under suitable potential range and facilitates high selectivity (80%) of the formation of acetaldehyde at a potential of −0.931 V vs RHE upon lowering of the hydrogen evolution reaction. The free energies of the molecule were determined theoretically using the density of states (DOS) of CuMoO4, and density functional study of the CO2 reduction pathway to acetaldehyde was accomplished by considering the free energy of intermediate charge transfer species.

Climate warming has led to a reduction of global crop yields. Elevated atmospheric [CO2] is believed to promote crop production by increasing photosynthesis, and thus partly offset the yield losses due to climate warming. However, photosynthetic acclimation may occur when the plant is exposed to long-term high [CO2] conditions, suggesting that elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]) might not bring benefits for cereal crops as the growing season proceeds. To assess the effect of long-term e[CO2] on rice yield, particularly on individual grain mass determined post-heading, we synthesized existing data from FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiments across four locations in Japan and China. We also conducted a five-year field experiment with different [CO2] treatments using OTC (open-top chamber) facility. A novel experiment of pot replacement at heading was conducted in 2018 to evaluate the effect of post-heading e[CO2] on individual grain mass of rice. Meanwhile, we measured net photosynthetic rates under ambient [CO2] (a[CO2]) and e[CO2] (ambient + 200 μmol mol−1) at different developmental stages to identify the occurrence of photosynthetic acclimation. We show that FACE condition did not increase individual grain mass across thirty-six inbred rice cultivars at various rates of nitrogen application, and that the replacement of potted plants either from a[CO2] to e[CO2] or from e[CO2] to a[CO2] did not impact the individual grain mass. The yield benefit from e[CO2] was primarily attributed to an increase in the spikelet density determined pre-heading. We conclude that the individual grain mass of inbred rice does not benefit from e[CO2], which is most likely attributed to a loss of the advantage in CO2 gain induced by photosynthetic acclimation. Our findings suggest the necessity for selective breeding strategies to make better use of post-heading e[CO2] and for crop modelers to incorporate updated knowledge into models in the context of elevated [CO2].

Abstract Due to the low permeability characteristics of the deep gas-containing coal seam, the conventional prevention and control measures that cannot solve the problems of gas outbursts are unsatisfactory for the prevention and control of the coal and gas outbursts disaster. Therefore, in this study, a strain of methane-oxidizing bacteria M 07 with high-pressure resistance, strong resistance, and high methane degradation rate was selected from coal mines. The growth and degradation abilities of M 07 in chelating wetting agent solutions to assess its adaptability and find the optimal agent-to-M07 ratio. It provides a new method for integrating the reduction of impact tendency and gas pressure in deep coal mines. The experimental results show that M 07 is a Gram-positive bacterium of the genus Bacillus , which has strong resistance and adaptability to high-pressure water injection. By degrading 70 mol of methane, M 07 produces 1 mol of carbon dioxide, which can reduce gas pressure and reduce the risk of gas outbursts in coal mines. As the experiment proves, the best effect was achieved when the M 07 concentration of the chelating wetting agent was 0.05%. The methane-oxidizing bacteria based on the chelating wetting agent as carriers prove a new prevention and control method for the integrated prevention and control of coal and gas outbursts in coal mines and also provide a new idea for microbial application in coal mine disaster control.

The commercial viability of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO is hampered by the sluggish electrocatalytic activity of the electrode materials. In this study, a series of perovskites, Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x = 0.1, 0.2, PSCFNx) with different Ni doping levels were synthesized. The results showed that increasing Ni doping led to the creation of more oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, treatment of PSCFNx in a reducing atmosphere resulted in a structural transformation into a composite with a heterogeneous interface between the Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (RP-PSCFNx) and an exsolved Ni-Fe metal alloy. The re-PSCFN0.2-based cell showed a current density of 2.40 A cm-2 and a Faraday efficiency (FE%) of almost 100% at 850 °C and 1.6 V, an improvement of 18% in comparison to the re-PSCFN0.1-based cell. This study provides a strategy to synergistically improve the electrochemical reduction of CO2 activity of SOECs by constructing an active heterogeneous interface and increasing the oxygen vacancy content.

Seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) offers an attractive option for decarbonizing heating in the built environment to promote renewable energy and reduce CO2 emissions. A literature review revealed knowledge gaps in evaluating the technical feasibility of replacing district heating (DH) with STES in densely populated areas and its impact on costs, fossil fuel consumption, CO2 emission reduction, and renewable power integration. The effects of large-scale STES applications on the power and DH sectors in a regional energy system were quantified by applying the 2030 and 2050 power structure scenarios. The results indicated that STES reduces fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions at an affordable cost. It facilitates the integration of wind and solar power into power grids. With 100% replacement of DH by STES, fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions can be reduced by approximately 40% and 45% in 2030 and 2050, respectively, with an annual cost increase of 20%. The CO2 avoidance costs were predicted to be approximately 60 €/t in 2030 and well below 50 €/t in 2050. STES will reduce renewable power curtailment by 10% in 2030 and 18% in 2050. This study investigated STES from an energy-system perspective, supporting the formulation of clean heating transition policies.

Recent years have witnessed a significant growth in the research and development of additive manufacturing methods involving concrete and cementitious materials, with technologies like three-dimensional (3D) printing becoming more widely used in the construction industry. Construction has the possibility to be revolutionized, not only in the context of cost savings but also in the context of increased sustainability and functionality. 3D printing of concrete is a cutting-edge technology that has the potential to speed up construction, reduce labor costs, give architects more creative freedom, improve precision, obviate requirements for formwork, and result in less construction wastes. In addition, 3D printing can be a long-term solution for both economy and environment. Even though 3D printing in concrete has made tremendous strides recently, developing an effective 3D-printable material that decreases material usage and enhances performance is critical for carbon dioxide reduction. Robust geopolymer formulations for 3D printing concrete technology in current construction applications have emerged as the subject of much research among scientists to find novel ways to circumvent this constraint. This study intends to highlight the current state of the art in developing 3D-Printed Geopolymer Concrete (3DPGC) with a comprehensive review related to the material composition, mix design, and mixing regimes on rheology of 3DPGC. The rheology of 3DPGC in terms of printability and buildability is discussed. The mixing regimes employed for the preparation of one-part and two-part 3DPGC are tabulated and commented on. Lastly, the research gaps are identified and summarized, and several research directions are also provided for future investigations to expedite the ubiquitous use of 3DPGC in versatile construction applications.

In the vast majority of studies, methanol production via CO2 hydrogenation is realized using bifunctional catalysts, commonly CuZnO phases. The basic motivation of this study is to confront main concerns regarding typical copper-based catalysts, which are the aggregation of the active metal nanoparticles (NPs) and its concomitant deactivation. For this, an extensive research on composites of mesoporous iron trimesate metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [crystalline MIL-100(Fe) and semiamorphous FeBTC], loaded with copper clusters (CuCs) into the pores, is performed, because it is a pioneer in the area. The growth and aggregation of CuCs are hindered by the confinement of the active entities into the MOF mesocages. From the two studied MOFs, only the copper loaded semiamorphous FeBTC behaves as a catalyst. To further enhance the catalytic activity, CuCs@FeBTC NPs are dispersed on the plates constituting a reduced graphene-oxide aerogel. Main steps in the preparation of these complex catalysts involve the use of sustainable technology based on supercritical CO2, used either as a solvent or drying agent. The reduction strategy designed to obtain the active catalyst (Cu2+ to Cu+/Cu0 in CuCs) was crucial to upgrade the end product performance. A double reduction route, applying ascorbic acid preceding thermal H2 reduction, turns out to be necessary to attain a significant catalytic activity of the confined Cu2+ species. The as-synthesized and spent catalysts were analyzed in regard of the structure (X-ray diffraction, infrared), bulk (mass spectrometry) and surface (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) composition, morphology (microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy) and textural properties (N2 physisorption). The catalytic performance of reduced CuCs@FeBTC and [CuCs@FeBTC]@rGO composites was tested in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at 10 bar. Methane and methanol were obtained as valuable reaction products. When using the [CuCs@FeBTC]@rGO aerogel, methanol yield was noticeably high, in comparison to reported data, in the order of 86 mgMeOHgCu–1 h–1; while the amount of side products (methane, CO) was almost totally hindered up to 260 °C.

The consumption of digital content is essential for economic and scientific development, leading to a high dependence on information and communication technologies, which significantly impacts the environment. Quantifying this ecological impact is challenging due to its intangible nature and the diversity of factors. This research focuses on assessing the energy consumption and CO2 production of Spanish university websites to evaluate their levels of digital pollution and environmental impact. The calculation of the carbon footprint considers factors related to energy consumption and the use of green or renewable energies. The findings indicate that only 17% of university websites can be considered environmentally friendly. There are significant differences in CO2 consumption and emissions depending on whether the websites implement environmentally sound practices. This study highlights the lack of initiatives aimed at reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with web information management. The study shows that Spanish universities have the potential to contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions by implementing sustainable development practices on their websites. Furthermore, it fosters awareness about technology usage and its environmental impact, promoting the adoption of green and sustainable approaches.

First row transition metal complexes have attracted attention as abundant and affordable electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Manganese complexes bearing bis-N-heterocyclic carbene ligands defining 6-membered ring metallacycles have proven to reduce CO2 to CO selectively at very high rates. Herein, we report the synthesis of manganese carbonyl complexes supported by a rigid ortho-phenylene bridged bis-N-heterocyclic carbene ligand (orthophenylene-bis(N-methylimidazol-2-ylidene, Ph-bis-mim), which defines a 7-membered ring metallacycle. We performed a comparative study with the analogues bearing an ethylene-bis(Nmethylimidazol-2-ylidene ligand (C2H4-bis-mim) and a methylenebis(N-methylimidazol-2-ylidene ligand (CH2-bis-mim) and found that catalysts comprising a seven-membered metallacycle retain similar selectivity and high activity as those with six-membered metallacycles, while reducing the overpotential by 120-190 mV. This study reveals general design principles for manganese bis-N-heterocyclic carbene electrocatalysts which can guide further designs of affordable, fast and low overpotential catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.

Sustainability continues to be a key field of study, encapsulating three principle dimensions: social, economic and environmental, which are also found within the context of climate change. However, there appears to be limited literature drawing upon the between sustainability and climate change. relationship, particularly in connection to carbon emissions and energy management. These issues have already been the subject of legislation in different countries, though still, predominantly individually rather than from an integrated perspective. The Climate Change At (2008) provides a platform through which the relationship between sustainability and climate change can be considered. This paper establishes this relationship aspects of this relationship by employing the increased use of insulation within the UK housing stock to contribute to achieving the carbon reduction set by the Act. Taking a retrospective view through theoretical numerical modelling, this paper demonstrates that CO2 reductions were achievable. The results demonstrate that links can be drawn between sustainability and climate change and identifies that significant CO2 savings, through robust energy management of the UK housing stock, these results can be achieved. It is also suggested that the theoretical mole developed can be reproduced to consider climate change targets and provide benchmarks, not only in the UK but in other countries.

The oxygen source of oxygenates is the fundamental issue for CO2/CO electroreduction, which was firmly believed to originate from the gas feed (Ogas) for a long time. However, recent experiments have confirmed that most O atoms of the generated alcohols via CO reduction arise from the solvent (Oaq), indicating the existence of a rather mysterious "oxygen exchange" process. In this work, we solved this mechanistic puzzle using comprehensive computations. Our results revealed that high CO pressure enables COgas oxidation by surface *OaqH, which opens a pathway for oxygenate production. The generated *COgasOaqH can react with another *CO to form *COCOgasOaqH, which leads to the formation of a series of carboxyl-containing intermediates (RCOgasOaqH) in subsequent steps. Due to the dynamic ionization equilibrium, H+ moves rapidly between Ogas and Oaq via reversible "inner" proton transfer (*RCOgasOaqH ⇌ *R-COgasOaq– + H+ ⇌ *RCOaqOgasH). The oxygen exchange completes when *RCOaq forms via the dehydroxylation of a certain *RCOaqOgasH. The completed reaction pathways were further explored by using COgas reduction into C2H5OaqH as an example, which explains related experiments. Therefore, these results refresh the insights into CO2/CO electroreduction and give specific guidelines for the optimization of catalytic performance.

The dynamic characterization of guest molecules in the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can always provide the insightful and inspiring information to facilitate the synthetic design of MOF materials from the bottom-up design of perspective. Herein, we present a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulation for investigating the bipyridine dicarboxylate (bpydc) linker rotation effect on guest molecule adsorption with and without considering the transition metal (TM) chelation in MOF-253 materials. The simulated PXRD patterns of the various linker orientations present the challenge of distinguishing these structural varieties by the conventional crystalline spectroscopic measurements. The observed short inter-TM stable structure may subsequently lead to the formation of a binuclear TM catalytic site, and a proposed formic acid generation mechanism from CO2 and H2 is derived based upon the density functional theory calculations for the application of CO2 reduction.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 over wood-derived metal-free N-doped carbon electrocatalysts provides a new route for converting CO2 into value-added fuels However, it is a challenge to efficiently design and screen high-performance electrocatalysts. In this paper, we combined the Marcus equation with the theory of thermal-kinetic correlation to successfully predict the optimal N-C doping ratio. Poplar wood -derived 3D N-doped graphitized carbon with optimal N doping content (pyridine-N 1.87 At%, pyrrole-N, 1.52 At%), high specific surface area (471.2 m2 g-1), and abundant nanopores were successfully obtained with the assistance of melamine (N source), which exhibited a high ECR activity of 86.78% at a low applied potential of -0.71 V (vs. RHE) and long-term stability of at least 10 cycles. This extends the application of the Marcus equation and improves new ideas for the future design of high-performance electrocatalysts.

The reverse water‐gas shift (RWGS) reaction serves as a critical pathway for converting CO2 into diverse chemicals. The Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which leverages lattice oxygen as the oxidant and oxygen vacancies as reductants, offers an alternative catalytic strategy for the selective RWGS reaction. While Mn‐substituted SrTiO3 (i.e., SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3) has been shown to promote the RWGS reaction selectively via the MvK mechanism, achieving a sufficient conversion of CO2 necessitates elevated temperatures. This study investigated the effect of Pd‐loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 on the activation of adsorbed H2 molecules, which generated oxygen vacancies and enhanced CO2 conversion. Notably, 1.0 wt% Pd‐loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 yielded 13.4% of CO at 673 K, whereas pristine SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 and Pd‐loaded SrTiO3 yielded negligible or minimal amount of CO. Hydrogen temperature‐programmed reduction and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed that Pd promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies via both thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and kinetic studies revealed that the RWGS reaction over Pd‐loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 proceeded primarily via the MvK mechanism with a partial contribution from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. This study underscores the effectiveness of combining metal and MvK‐type catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the RWGS reaction.

The transportation sector is responsible for about 16% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Despite efforts for a sensible reduction by means of new technologies’ development, the average age of a vehicle fleet is 12.3 years in the European Union. In light of this, actions aiming at improving the efficiency of circulating vehicles can prove effective in the short to mid-term. Introducing performance packages in standard fuels could allow a reduction in the CO2 emissions of whole vehicle fleets without any modification to powertrain. Such a kind of additive is generally used in premium fuels; deposit control additives can reduce or control the deposits at intake valves and at nozzle holes with benefits for the fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions. Further improvements in combustion phasing can be achieved with cetane/octane improver. This paper aims to assess the influence of two performance packages on the exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of five vehicles set to be as representative as possible of circulating Italian passenger cars and light commercial fleet vehicles (LCVs). Based on the literature datasets, three Euro 4 vehicles were selected with a mileage representative of each single vehicle class: two passenger cars (one spark ignition and one diesel) and an LCV. Further, two diesel Euro 6 vehicles, a passenger car and an LCV, were tested to investigate the effect of fuel additives on the combustion of vehicles compliant with current homologation regulation. Exhaust emissions and fuel consumption were experimentally estimated on a chassis dynamometer over a worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC) in a climate-controlled laboratory. Each vehicle was preliminarily tested when running with base fuel, then a 3000 km clean-up stage was performed using the additive package. Finally, WLTC tests were repeated. Results demonstrated the efficiency of the performance packages with a reduction between 1.2% (diesel Euro 6 passenger car) and 8.1% (diesel Euro 4 passenger car) in fuel consumption. Similar trends were found for CO2 emissions. Further, a sensible reduction in THCs, CO and PM was found for each vehicle class.

Unlike the linear model of economic development, which is based on taking resources from nature, turning them into a finished product and using that product as the final stage of the life cycle of resources, without taking into account the degree of pollution they cause, there is a so-called circular model. The circular model of the economy is an alternative to the linear model. This means that with the circular model, the use of the finished product does not represent the last phase of the life cycle of the resource, but that used product, through the application of various processes, serves as a resource in further production. The main goal of the circular economic model is to reduce waste and pollution, but also to increase the productivity of resources. Longer use of products, machines, and other fixed assets results in higher productivity of the resources that make up their basic input. One of the main goals of the circular economy is the elimination or at least reduction of pollution, and one of the biggest pollutants is the excessive emission of carbon dioxide, whose chemical formula is 〖CO〗2. For this reason, the authors of this research recognized this area as crucial for further economic development. By applying various processes and procedures in developed countries, there was a decrease in the amount of 〖CO〗2emissions, while at the same time there was no decrease in economic activities and production in the economies of those countries, but quite the opposite, at the same time there was an increase in the gross national product (GDP). Serbia should use these countries as an example and, using the good practice of developed countries, start as soon as possible with a more extensive transition from a linear to a circular model of economic development, i.e. bring a series of measures, procedures, laws as soon as possible in order to reduce the emission of 〖CO〗2. In accordance with this, the logical conclusion would be that the scientific goal of this research work is to identify the role of reducing 〖CO〗2 emissions as an important potential for the transition from a linear to a circular model of economic development, without jeopardizing the level of real GDP.

Environmental concerns have spurred a quest for more sustainable and safer solvents, aiming to replace aggressive and harmful chemical products in industrial processes. In response to this need, deep eutectic solvents (DES) have emerged as a progressive evolution from ionic liquids. These innovative solvents result from the synergistic combination of two or more chemical compounds, exhibiting a significant reduction in melting point when blended in specific molar fractions, ultimately achieving a liquid state at room temperature. In recent years, a natural variant known as Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) has gained prominence. This environmentally friendly alternative is derived by skilfully combining compounds such as sugars, amino acids, or organic acids, presenting a promising avenue for sustainable and eco-friendly chemical processes. These "green" solvents go beyond applications in chemical or materials engineering, finding application in diverse fields such as biocatalysis, extraction processes, and carbon dioxide capture, among others. Despite their numerous advantages, including low cost, ease of preparation, tuneable properties, and biorenewability, the full potential of DES remains elusive due to insufficient understanding, hindering their seamless integration into industrial applications. While previous reviews have predominantly focused on defining and showcasing the applications of DES, they often overlook the crucial aspect of physicochemical characterization. Similar to other solvent classes, the physicochemical properties of DES such as polarity, viscosity, density, and conductivity play a pivotal role in determining their applicability. Recognizing this gap, the primary objective of this review is to provide a practical guide encompassing the preparation, characterization, and application of DES, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding of these solvents for both researchers and practitioners alike. Moreover, the manuscript will delve into the diverse types of DES, exploring their unique physicochemical properties and potential modifications tailored for various applications across different fields.

Decrease in permeability, porosity, change in wettability of oil-bearing formations during field development are defined by a general term - formation damage, which occur at various stages of field development, including drilling, production, application of enhanced oil recovery methods, well stimulation technologies with acid compositions, hydraulic fracturing and well workover. Reservoir damage leads to a reduction in the oil and gas content of reservoirs and in the economic efficiency of operation. In this regard, it is important to understand and prevent formation damage based on experimental and analytical methods, the applicationof which will minimize damage to the oil and gas bearing reservoir. The review considers anthropogenic processes that cause damage to oil and gas reservoir when CO2 is injected by various methods to enhance oil recovery. The processes of interaction of CO2 with formation rock are considered in detail. The main geochemical transformations of rock minerals are given, which lead to changes in the structure of pore space, permeability and porosity, decrease of geomechanical properties. Secondary sedimentation processes and risks of rock particles removal into the borehole are discussed.

To explore sustainability strategies in the transport sector in a holistic way, a model dedicated to passenger transportation has been created as a part of the multiregional WILIAM model (Within Limits Integrated Assessment Model). Based on system dynamics, our model increases the diversity of existing passenger transport models within Integrated Assessments Models by offering a detailed representation of the dynamics of the transition for different technologies and transport modes combining technological and behavioural changes. It calculates the energy demand, direct emissions and additional material requirements of the transport sector and can be linked to other submodules of WILIAM to study different feedback loops. Here we report the validation of the offline model and illustrate its usefulness and practical applicability. First, a Baseline transport scenario for Spain was developed and parametrized. This scenario describes the plausible evolution of the Spanish passenger transport system in the absence of ambitious environmental policies but nevertheless achieves a reduction of total direct CO2 emissions from passenger transport from 66 Mt CO2/year in 2022 to 60 Mt CO2/year in 2035, after which emissions remain constant until 2050. Subsequently, following the Avoid-shift-improve approach, various behavioural change measures and technological improvements were introduced. The comparison of the different modelled measures reveals that the most effective tested strategy to reduce direct emissions is the transition to battery electric power trains for cars, buses, and motorcycles, however at the cost of the highest material requirements. Further work will be dedicated to the study of the implications of the link of this submodule with the rest of WILIAM.

Portland cement concrete is the most consumed material in buildings and infrastructure. The use of portland cement is not limited to building constructions, it is also used as a repairing material. The production of portland cement has a noticeable economic and environmental effects. The paper addresses the economic and environmental benefits of using calcined clay as supplementary cementitious material with high partial replacement of portland cement. The economic benefits include the initial costs and the maintenance cost, which is achieved by enhancing the concrete durability. The cost of calcined clay is strongly affected by the transportation expenses and the availability of local sources. The environmental benefits include the reduction of the CO2 footprint caused by portland cement production.

Abstract Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration has been steadily increasing since the 19th century, causing global warming. Despite efforts to reduce emissions, current projections anticipate a significant increase in global mean temperature by the end of the century, which may push us beyond a safe and just operating space. We must develop emissions pathways that take into account renewable technology innovation, climate policy development and consumer behavior change. In this manuscript we assess corporate emissions reduction ambition in the context of reduction pathways, and in doing so show that company reporting has reached a scale and quality that it can be used to supplement global emissions forecasting. We find emissions disclosures of target-setting companies to account for roughly a fifth of global CO2 emissions and three-fifths of total market capitalisation. Of these, we find near-term targets to be consistent with the aggressive reduction requirements of the divergent net-zero scenario published by the Network for Greening the Financial System, but commitments to 2050 are lacking. There is a large disparity between the total market capitalisation of disclosing companies and the total emissions they cover, a disconnect which we emphasise must be addressed by future

Quantifying this ecological impact is challenging due to its intangible nature and the diversity of factors. This research focuses on assessing the energy consumption and CO2 production of Spanish university websites to evaluate their levels of digital pollution and environmental impact. The calculation of the carbon footprint considers factors related to energy consumption and the use of green or renewable energies. The findings indicate that only 17% of university websites can be considered environmentally friendly. There are significant differences in CO2 consumption and emissions depending on whether the websites implement environmentally sound practices. This study highlights the lack of initiatives aimed at reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with web information management. The study shows that Spanish universities have the potential to contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions by implementing sustainable development practices on their websites. Furthermore, it fosters awareness about technology usage and its environmental impact, promoting the adoption of green and sustainable approaches.

Bioethanol production is a vital player in the renewable energy landscape. However, it faces pressing issues regarding carbon emissions and resource management. Traditional open-loop systems generate substantial waste and pollution, exacerbating environmental concerns. Various emerging technologies offer promising solutions. Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) presents avenues for tackling carbon emissions. Utilization transforms CO2 emissions into valuable products, while Storage securely stores emissions to prevent atmospheric release. Closed-loop processes and waste valorization capitalize on material reuse, conserving natural resources, and minimizing waste. By promoting resource efficiency and waste minimization, circular economy principles align seamlessly with CCUS, closed-loop systems, and waste valorization. This study delves into utilizing Utilization technologies tailored to sugarcane 1G+2G bioethanol production, evaluates CO2 capture options, and presents applications. Storage strategies suitable for bioethanol production facilities are scrutinized, and deployment options are explored, highlighting the closed-loop system and waste valorization's role in waste reduction and environmental preservation. Through synergistic integration, these technologies pave the way for sustainable sugarcane bioethanol production, addressing economic and technological challenges while fostering innovation and collaboration. This comprehensive study will serve as a guide for transitioning to a circular economy model in bioethanol production.

Co-disposal experiments involving industrial solid waste (ISW) are conducted at a municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plant in this study, investing the environmental impact of co-disposal with different ISW addition proportions using life cycle assessment (LCA). Results show that increasing ISW proportions improves economic indicators, reducing the payback period from 7.92 years (0 % ISW) to 6.58 years (40 % ISW). Environmental impact indicators initially decrease and then increase. The indicator with the greatest environmental impact is Eutrophication Potential (EP), the only major indicator with positive values in all scenarios when considering power output. Its normalization value reaches a minimum at 30 % ISW blending, at 7.85 × 10−12. Contribution analysis reveals that the direct emissions of N-containing gases are the primary cause, while the addition of urea, ammonia water, and quicklime in flue gas treatment, as well as the ash-slag landfill, also have significant effects. Technical optimization of stepwise co-disposal, denitrification system and ash-slag reduction will be the focus. Compared to the existing conventional situation, the co-disposal system exhibits considerable improvements in environmental benefits and carbon reduction potential. Notably, there is a significant reduction in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. This study offers theoretical insights for multi-source waste disposal in MSW incineration plants.

Language models of code have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various software engineering and source code analysis tasks. However, their demanding computational resource requirements and consequential environmental footprint remain as significant challenges. This work introduces ALPINE, an adaptive programming language-agnostic pruning technique designed to substantially reduce these models' computational overhead. The proposed method offers a pluggable layer that can be integrated with all Transformer-based models. With ALPINE, input sequences undergo adaptive compression throughout the pipeline, reaching a size up to $\times 3$ less their initial size, resulting in significantly reduced computational load. Our experiments on two software engineering tasks, defect prediction and code clone detection across three language models CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT and UniXCoder show that ALPINE achieves up to a 50% reduction in FLOPs, a 58.1% decrease in memory footprint, and a 28.1% improvement in throughput on average. This led to a reduction in CO2 by up to $44.85$%. Importantly, it achieves the reduction in computation resources while maintaining up to 98.1% of the original predictive performance. These findings highlight the potential of ALPINE in making language models of code more resource-efficient and accessible while preserving their performance, contributing to the overall sustainability of adopting language models in software development. Also, it sheds light on redundant and noisy information in source code analysis corpora, as shown by the substantial sequence compression achieved by ALPINE.

This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by examining the impact of CO2emissions on public debt in Malaysia, employing a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach spanning from 1980 to 2020. This methodology captures the non-linear relationship between CO2 emissions and public debt, providing nuanced insights into how environmental factors shape fiscal dynamics. Despite encountering challenges arising from the limited body of literature on this specific relationship, the study highlights key findings with profound implications for policymakers. The inverse correlation between trade openness and public debt underscores the influence of international trade on Malaysia's fiscal landscape, while a positive association between investment and public debt emphasizes the importance of prudent debt management for economic growth. Furthermore, the negative relationship between higher foreign direct investment and long-term public debt highlights the need to foster an investor-friendly environment. A pivotal contribution is the confirmation of a positive link between CO2 emissions and public debt, urging policymakers to prioritize emission reduction strategies, implement carbon pricing, and promote green technologies. This research offers a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between CO2emissions and public debt, providing valuable insights for informed policy decisions in the Malaysian context.

Abstract Permafrost thaw in northern peatlands causes collapse of permafrost peat plateaus and thermokarst bog development, with potential impacts on atmospheric greenhouse gas exchange. Here, we measured methane and carbon dioxide fluxes over 3 years (including winters) using static chambers along two permafrost thaw transects in northwestern Canada, spanning young (~30 years since thaw), intermediate and mature thermokarst bogs (~200 years since thaw). Young bogs were wetter, warmer and had more hydrophilic vegetation than mature bogs. Methane emissions increased with wetness and soil temperature (40 cm depth) and modelled annual estimates were greatest in the young bog during the warmest year and lowest in the mature bog during the coolest year (21 and 7 g C‐CH 4 m −2 year −1 , respectively). The dominant control on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the mature bog (between +20 and −54 g C‐CO 2 m −2 year −1 ) was soil temperature (5 cm), causing net CO 2 loss due to higher ecosystem respiration (ER) in warmer years. In contrast, wetness controlled NEE in the young and intermediate bogs (between +55 and −95 g C‐CO 2 m −2 year −1 ), where years with periodic inundation at the beginning of the growing season caused greater reduction in gross primary productivity than in ER leading to CO 2 loss. Winter fluxes (November–April) represented 16% of annual ER and 38% of annual CH 4 emissions. Our study found NEE of thermokarst bogs to be close to neutral and rules out large CO 2 losses under current conditions. However, high CH 4 emissions after thaw caused a positive net radiative forcing effect. While wet conditions favouring high CH 4 emissions only persist for the initial young bog period, we showed that continued climate warming with increased ER, and thus, CO 2 losses from the mature bog can cause net positive radiative forcing which would last for centuries after permafrost thaw.

Rocky exoplanets' internal constitution is inferred indirectly through their atmospheric composition. Confidence in this inference necessitates coupling interior and atmospheric models. In the past, various atmospheric redistribution models were developed to determine the composition of exoplanetary atmospheres by varying element abundance, temperature and pressure (Woitke et al., 2021).However, these models neglect that present-day atmospheres were formed via volcanic degassing and, consequently, element abundances are limited by thermodynamic processes accompanying magma ascent and volatile release. Here we combine volcanic outgassing with an atmospheric chemistry model to simulate the evolution of C-H-O-N-S atmospheres in thermal equilibrium below 600 K. These volatiles can be stored in significant amounts in basaltic magmas and are the most commonly degassed species.Our model calculates possible atmospheric compositions by varying oxygen fugacity, melt and surface temperature, and volatile abundances, considering phase solubility, atmospheric processes (e.g., water condensation, hydrogen escape), the change in redox conditions caused by volcanic activity and the influence of existing atmospheres on further degassing.Our findings indicate that the prevailing atmospheric type below 600 K typically consists of CO2, N2, CH4, and, depending on temperature, H2O. Moreover, we illustrate that evolving atmospheric pressure and composition hinge significantly on the oxygen fugacity of the melt due to its impact on gas speciation and solubility. Reduced conditions yield atmospheres dominated by H2, NH3, CH4, and H2O, with exceedingly low atmospheric pressures. In contrast, oxidized conditions result in atmospheres comprising H2O, CO2, N2, and limited CH4, accompanied by high atmospheric pressures. Sulfur gases emerge predominantly at higher surface temperatures, manifesting as S2 or H2S under low mantle redox states and as SO2 under high mantle redox states. Notably, O2 is not generated abiotically, as sufficient carbon or hydrogen remains available to form H2O, CO, or CO2. Therefore, the formation of O2-dominated atmospheres would require excessive photodissociation of H2O or CO2 (Chang et al., 2021), a phenomenon likely common on planets orbiting M-dwarf stars.In addition to highlighting the indirect inference of rocky exoplanets' internal constitution through their atmospheric composition, we demonstrate that reduced magmas can oxidize via H2 and CO degassing, whereas oxidized magmas may undergo reduction through SO2 degassing. Furthermore, we conclude that the depth of the magma source region and the planetary size significantly influence atmospheric compositions due to the varying pressure dependence of degassed species' solubilities.

In this study, the physiological performance and fruit quality responses of the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) cultivar Legacy to high temperatures (HTs) were evaluated in a field experiment. Three-year-old V. corymbosum plants were exposed to two temperature treatments between fruit load set and harvest during the 2022/2023 season: (i) ambient temperature (AT) and (ii) high temperature (HT) (5 °C ± 1 °C above ambient temperature). A chamber covered with transparent polyethylene (100 µm thick) was used to apply the HT treatment. In our study, the diurnal temperature was maintained with a difference of 5.03 °C ± 0.12 °C between the AT and HT treatments. Our findings indicated that HT significantly decreased CO2 assimilation (Pn) by 45% and stomatal conductance (gs) by 35.2% compared to the AT treatment. By contrast, the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) showed higher levels (about 6%) in HT plants than in AT plants. Fruit quality analyses revealed that the fruit weight and equatorial diameter decreased by 39% and 13%, respectively, in the HT treatment compared to the AT treatment. By contrast, the firmness and total soluble solids (TSS) were higher in the HT treatment than in the AT treatment. Meanwhile, the titratable acidity showed no changes between temperature treatments. In our study, Pn reduction could be associated with stomatal and non-stomatal limitations under HT treatment. Although these findings improve our understanding of the impact of HTs on fruit growth and quality in V. corymbosum, further biochemical and molecular studies are need.

The integration of post-combustion capture (PCC) CO2 technologies with power plants and high-emission industrial processes has become imperative for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating environmental impacts. This study focuses on addressing the significant energy consumption associated with PCC and explores the potential of using solar thermal energy to optimize configurations, thereby enhancing sustainability and reducing dependency on conventional power sources. Simulate various configurations under steady-state conditions using Aspen HYSYS V11 and Aspen Economic Evaluation software. The results indicate a substantial reduction in energy consumption to 2.1 GJ/ton CO2 after the initial optimization steps. The key innovations involve the integration of Lean Vapor Compression (LVC), Solvent Split Flow (SSF), Rich Solvent Recycle (RSR), and Rich Vapor Compression (RVC). Further optimization was conducted by integrating a reboiler with parabolic trough collectors (PTC), to reduce energy penalties. The LVC+RVC+RSR+SSF+PTC configuration results reveal a notable improvement in exergoeconomic factors, ranging from 3.13% to 7.8%, highlighting the economic feasibility of the optimized configurations. Simultaneously, the energy penalty decreased by 11.1%, signifying enhanced sustainability in the proposed PCC system. This study contributes to the gap in research by demonstrating the efficacy of solar thermal energy in optimizing PCC configurations, providing a pathway towards more sustainable and energy-efficient solutions for carbon capture in high-emission industrial sectors. The findings offer insights for researchers, engineers, and policymakers aiming to address the pressing issue of carbon emissions from industrial processes.

Blast furnace ironmaking plays an important role in modern industry and the development of the economy. A reasonable ingredient scheme is crucial for energy efficiency and emission reduction in blast furnace production. Determining the right blast furnace ingredients is a complicated process; therefore, this study examines the optimization of the ingredient ratio. In this paper a model of the blast furnace ingredients is established by considering cost of per ton iron, CO2 emissions, and the theoretical coke ratio as the objective functions; ingredient parameters, process parameters, main and by-product parameters as variables; and the blast furnace smelting theory and equilibrium equation as constraints. Then, the model is solved by using an improved grey wolf optimization algorithm and an improved multi-objective grey wolf optimization algorithm. Using the data collected from the steel mill, the conclusion is that multi-objective optimization can consider the indexes of each target, so that the values of all the targets are excellent; we also compared the multi-objective solution results with the original production scheme of the steel mill, and we found that using the blast furnace ingredient scheme optimized in this study can reduce the cost of iron per ton, CO2 emissions per ton, and the theoretical coke ratio in blast furnace production by 350 CNY/t, 1000 kg/t, and 20 kg/t, respectively, compared with the original production plan. Thus, steel mill decision makers can choose the blast furnace ingredients according to different business strategies and the actual needs of steel mills can be better met.

Background: The addition of Zeolite 4A affected cumulative greenhouse emissions from rice. Zeolite 4A has been found to adsorb CH4 and CO2, reducing overall emissions. The combination of zeolite and fertilizer administration in one or two applications provided an anti-synergistic effect. Methods: The chemical fertilizers and sustained release organic fertilizers used were 16200, 4600 and 666, respectively, and the amount was 31.25 gm2. Findings: Higher fertilization stimulated harvesting, resulting in higher yields and higher proportions of good grain, but less efficient GHG reductions. The ratio of zeolite 4A to fertilizer should be higher than 3: 1 to reduce the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fertilizer. This treatment resulted in an emission reduction efficiency of 34.69% in proportion to 21.62 g CO2eq m2 g1 zeolite. Conclusion: In the current study, two applications, fertilizer and zeolite 4A, showed the best performance in reducing emissions. However, it is advisable to increase the ratio of zeolite to fertilizer. Similarly, sustained release organic fertilizers resulted in increased CH4 emissions due to the action of methanogens on organic matter. However, plant growth, good grain proportions, and total grain yields increased. Further research is recommended to investigate the optimal ratio of zeolite 4A to organic and synthetic fertilizers for rice cultivation.

Abstract. In light of the necessity to meet growing energy demands while minimising expenses, this article examines two solar power system designs, considering peak and average load situations. The peak system, designed to handle a peak load of 190 MW with 260,568 PV panels installed, generates a significant excess of approximately 49,911 MWh annually. On the other hand, the average load design suggests a little deficit in energy. The monetary analysis reveals considerable capital expenditures for the total installation costs, totalling $58.77 million for an average system and $66.71 million for the peak system. However, the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) rates are relatively competitive, at 0.0835 USD/kWh and 0.0736 USD/kWh respectively. Notably, the study highlights that the environmental impact analysis demonstrates a significant decrease in CO2 emissions, with the peak system achieving a reduction of up to 3,601,588 tonnes per year. This research has explicitly validated the capabilities of centralised solar power systems in addressing the current and future energy difficulties faced by the Government of Sindh in a sustainable and economically viable manner.

Clarifying the factors influencing CO2 emissions and their peaking pathways in major sectors holds significant practical importance for achieving regional dual-carbon goals. This paper takes Jiangxi, a less developed demonstration zone in central China, as an example. It pioneeringly combines the LMDI method, Tapio decoupling model, and LEAP model to multi-dimensionally analyze the driving mechanisms, evolution patterns, and dynamic relationships with the economic development of carbon emissions in Jiangxi’s key sectors from 2007 to 2021. It also explores the future carbon emission trends and peaking potentials of various sectors under different scenarios. Our results show that (1) Carbon emissions in various sectors in Jiangxi have continued to grow over the past fifteen years, and although some sectors have seen a slowdown in emission growth, most still rely on traditional fossil fuels; (2) Economic growth and industrial structure effects are the main drivers of carbon emission increases, with a general trend towards decoupling achieved across sectors, while agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, and ferrous metal smelting have shown a decline in their decoupling status; (3) In the carbon reduction and low-carbon scenarios, the carbon emission peaks in Jiangxi are estimated to be 227.5 Mt and 216.4 Mt, respectively, and targeted strategies for high-emission industries will facilitate a phased peak across sectors and enhance emissions reduction benefits. This has significant reference value for the central region and even globally in formulating differentiated, phased, sector-specific carbon peaking plans, and exploring pathways for high-quality economic development in tandem with ecological civilization construction.

A facile synthetic protocol was employed to synthesize new coumarin Schiff base (E)-3-(1-((2-hydroxy-5- methylphenyl)imino)ethyl)-2H-chromen-2-one] and their Co and Cu metal complexes. Synthesized molecules were characterized by various spectroscopic methods. The results of antibacterial studies demonstrated that the maximum level of growth inhibition for S. aureus and B. subtilis was shown by compound 5, with inhibition zones of 16±1 mm and 18.5±1.3 mm, respectively, while, Compound 4 exhibited 12.5±0.5 mm and 14±0.25 mm, respectively. Invitro Cytotoxicity of Cu-complex 5 towards human hepatocellular adenocarcinoma cancer cells, at concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 g/mL, displayed a reduction in the percentage of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with values of 72.45%, 60.12%, 48.69%, and 23.25%, respectively. The results revealed that Compound 5 has the potential to interact with the bacterial membrane surface, leading to the disruption of the same. Additionally, potentiometric analysis was used to estimate the proton-ligand dissociation constant of HL as well as its metal stability constants with Co2+ and Cu2+ .

Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu–S ionic bond is coupled with S–Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu–S bond from 2.24 Å to 2.30 Å. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu–S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72%. Conversely, Cu3SbS4 characterized by an elongated Cu–S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu‒S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu3SbS4 compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano‐shaped correlation between the Cu–S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates that Cu–S in Cu3SbS4 as double‐active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu3SbS4 toward CO.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce multi-carbon products (C2+) is one of the most sustainable manners to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Among many approaches, enriching grain boundaries (GBs) in copper (Cu) catalysts has been demonstrated to enable enhancement for C2+ production. However, it still lacks effective strategies to controllably synthesize abundant GBs, rendering efficient C2+ production a persistent challenge, especially at ampere-level current density. Herein, we propose a novel strategy, which can achieve unconventional grain fragmentation during thermal annealing and thus create controllable GB densities. The catalyst with the utmost GB density exhibits a peak C2+ faradaic efficiency (FE) of ca. 70.0% in an H-type cell and 68.2% in a flow cell; even more impressively, it delivers an ultra-high C2+ current density of 0.768 A cm-2, outperforming most recently reported results. A combination of in situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations reveal that the enrichment of GBs yields more active sites for a higher ⁎CO coverage, leading to promotion of the ⁎CO-⁎CO coupling process and ultimately high C2+ production performance.

In an overwhelming number of cases, the closure of a coal mine in Poland, for safety reasons, requires the installation of a pumping station and systems for the drainage of inflowing water due to its connection via roadways, goaves, or water-leaking pillars with other adjacent active mines. Due to operational costs, stationary pumping stations are being replaced with submersible pumping stations, wherever the geological/mining conditions allow this. The key factors to be considered when designing a submersible pumping station include the estimated water influx and the storage and emergency reservoir fill-up time. If the water level in the emergency reservoir exceeds the level of the maximum ordinate, there is the risk of water flooding an adjacent active mine, which poses a serious safety risk to this mine. A pumping station design must ensure that water can be pumped out also in emergency situations and must ensure permanent control over the level of the water table. The pumped-out water, after potential treatment, can be utilized as technological water in industrial plants. In the designed pumping station, it is also feasible to establish underground pumped-storage hydropower. This would enable the storage of energy from renewable sources, thereby contributing to CO2 emission reduction.

Introduction:&#160; Enceladus&#8217;s erupting plume likely originates from a subsurface ocean, and thus represents an avenue for revealing the ocean composition. The plume composition was measured by two mass spectrometers on Cassini during flythroughs of the plume. These measurements currently provide our best means of estimating Enceladus&#8217;s ocean chemistry and the moon&#8217;s potential to host life. The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA; Srama et al. 2004) measured the composition of ice grains in the plume and Saturn&#8217;s E ring, finding a variety salts (including biologically useful phosphate) and organic molecules that could be hydrothermal, primordial, or possibly biological in origin (e.g., Postberg et al. 2018, 2023; Khawaja et al. 2019). The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS; Waite et al. 2006) analyzed the gases in the plume and detected CO2, NH3, H2, CH4 and HCN, which suggests conditions in the ocean are likely favorable for chemotrophy (e.g., methanogenesis) and possibly prebiotic chemistry (e.g., Waite et al. 2017, Peter et al. 2023).Motivation: However, the relative abundances of key molecules in the plume may be quite different in the ocean due to fractionating processes during eruption (Fifer et al. 2022). The effects of fractionation are important when considering how the plume gas represents (or misrepresents) the abundances of gases in the ocean. For instance, condensation of water vapor onto the icy walls of the tiger stripe fissures can cause gases like CO2 to have much higher abundances (relative to water) in the plume than in the ocean (Glein et al. 2015; Glein &amp; Waite 2020; Fifer et al. 2022). In a competing fractionation, the differential exsolution of gases from Enceladus&#8217;s ocean will tend to enrich water vapor in the plume relative to other gases (Fifer et al. 2022). While CDA in situ measurements suggest that the ocean&#8217;s pH is ~8.5 &#8211; 10.5 (e.g., Postberg et al. 2009, Postberg et al. 2023), studies to account for fractionation and estimate ocean gas content and pH from the plume measurements have produced a wide range of possible ocean compositions, with pH ~6&#8211;13 (e.g., Marion et al. 2012; Glein et al. 2015). Thus, quantifying fractionation in the plume gas during eruption can better determine the ocean composition.Here, we used laboratory experiments to constrain a key fractionation process: the exsolution of gases at the liquid-gas interface.Methods:&#160; In a stainless steel vessel at 0&#176;C, we added pure water or saline solutions and degassed them under vacuum. We then introduced a single gas (e.g., CO2) and allowed it to dissolve to equilibrium. We monitored the headspace pressure and partially evacuated the headspace gas, driving gas exsolution in an analogous process to how the plumes may form from a water-filled fissure on Enceladus. We can calculate a mass transfer coefficient associated with exsolution by monitoring the increasing headspace pressure during exsolution and deriving the concentration remaining in solution. We also used a stir bar to investigate the effects of stirring or mixing on exsolution.Results:&#160; We find a positive linear correlation between stir rate and mass transfer coefficient for CO2 (Figure 1) consistent with previous experiments investigating gas transfer in water (Nishimura et al. 1991). Notably, our mass transfer coefficients are comparable to those derived for ocean-atmosphere exchange on Earth (Broecker &amp; Peng 1982). In trials using a 0.2 NaCl solution, we found a reduction in the mass transfer coefficient of CO2 by ~25% compared to pure water, which is larger than in previous studies (~10%) for CO2 diffusion in NaCl solutions (Zhang et al. 2015).Figure 1: Mass transfer coefficient for CO2 exsolution from pure water as a function of stir rate in solution. Conclusions: We find that the mass transfer coefficient of CO2 strongly depends on the rate of stirring. For Enceladus&#8217;s plume formation, this means that an observed flux of erupting gas could originate from either a well-mixed ocean with low gas concentrations or a poorly-mixed ocean with higher gas concentrations. Therefore, it is important to quantify the degree of mixing in the surface ocean where the plume gas is likely sourced.&#160;References:Broecker, W.S., and Peng, T.H.. 1982. Tracers in the Sea.

Ice accumulation poses considerable challenges in transportation, notably in the domain of general aviation. The present study combines the strengths and limitations of conventional aircraft de-icing techniques with the emerging trend toward all-electric aircraft. The study aims to utilize laser-induced graphene (LIG) technology to create a multifunctional surface, seamlessly integrating hydrophobic properties with efficient electrical heating to mitigate surface icing effectively. We investigated the utilization of a 10.6 μm CO2 laser for direct writing on polyimide (PI), a widely-used insulating encapsulation material. From the thermomechanical perspective, our initial analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics software revealed that when the laser power P exceeds 5 W, the PI substrate experience ablative damage. The experimental results show that when P ≤ 5W, an increase in power has a positive impact on the quality, surface porosity, roughness reduction, line-spacing reduction, and water contact-angle enhancement of the graphene. Conversely, when P &amp;gt; 5 W, higher power negatively affects both the substrate and the graphene structure by inducing excessive ablation. However, it influences the graphene line height positively and is consistent with overall experimental-simulation congruence. Furthermore, the incorporation of high-quality graphene resulted in a surface that exhibited higher contact angles (CA &amp;gt; 120°), lower energy consumption, and higher heating efficiency compared to the use of traditional electrically heated materials for anti-icing applications. The potential applications of this one-step fabrication method extend across various industries, particularly aviation, marine engineering, and other ice-prone domains. Moreover, the method has extensive prospects for addressing pivotal challenges associated with ice formation and serves an innovative and efficient anti-icing technology.

Abstract This research uses the sol-gel method to look into how adding Co2+ and Ce3+ dopant cations changes the structure, shape, and electrical properties of M-type Ba hexagonal ferrites that have been synthesized. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the successful formation of the targeted hexagonal M-type crystal structure. We observed a reduction in unit cell volume and lattice parameters as the dopant concentration increased, indicating the effective incorporation of dopant ions into the crystal lattice. When the doping process happened, needle-like grain shapes appeared, which could be seen with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).&#xD;As the concentration of the dopant increased, the dielectric spectroscopic measurements revealed an increase in the loss tangent (tan δ) from 0.05 to 3.68, and a decrease in the dielectric constant (ε′) from 283 to 3.41. This suggests a reduction in polarization and dielectric permittivity, as well as increased energy dissipation within the material. The electric modulus spectra showed relaxation behaviour that was non-Debye-type, which is another sign that there are complex and multifaceted ways for charges to move. The measurements of relaxation time and AC conductivity showed that the relaxation intervals were not regular and that the conductivity dropped from 2.22*10-4 Ω⁻¹m⁻¹ to 1.4*10-7 Ω⁻¹m⁻¹ as the doping concentration increased. Based on these findings, it seems that the processes of conductivity and dielectric relaxation play a big role in how charges move around in the doped ferrites. We validated complex impedance data obtained through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) software against calculated impedance values. The derived grain and grain boundary characteristics also agreed with the observed grain distribution and boundaries from the micrographs, further corroborating the analysis.

Escalating global surface temperatures are highlighting the urgent need for energy-saving solutions. Phase-change materials (PCMs) have emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing thermal comfort in the construction sector. This study assessed the impact of incorporating PCMs ranging from 1% to 10% by mass into composite Portland cement partially replaced by fly ash (FA) and nanosilica particles (NS). Mechanical and electrochemical techniques were utilized to evaluate composite cements. The results indicate that the presence of PCMs delayed cement hydration, acting as a filler without chemically interacting within the composite. The combination of FA and PCMs reduced compressive strength at early ages, while thermal conductivity decreased after 90 days due to the melting point and the latent heat of PCMs. Samples with FA and NS showed a significant reduction in the CO2 penetration, attributed to their pozzolanic and microfiller effects, as well as reduced water absorption due to the non-absorptive nature of PCMs. Nitrogen physisorption confirmed structural changes in the cement matrix. Additionally, electrical resistivity and thermal behavior assessments revealed that PCM-containing samples could reduce temperatures by an average of 4 °C. This suggested that PCMs could be a viable alternative for materials with thermal insulation capacity, thereby contributing to energy efficiency in the construction sector.

This study aims at evaluating the anticancer effect on the MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7) cell line of human breast cancer using Thymoquinone and Tamoxifen alone as well as in combination therapy by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) Test. NCCS in Pune provided the MCF-7 cell line. The cells were kept at 37°C in a humidified medium of 50µg/ml CO2 in Minimal Essential Medium added with 10percent FBS (Foetal Bovine Serum), streptomycin (100µg/ml), as well as penicillin (100U/ml). MTT-(3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) test was conducted on MCF-7 cell line for Thymoquinone and Tamoxifen as sole and combination therapy. Measurements were performed using UV (Ultra-Violet)-spectrophotometer at 570-nanometre absorbance and the content needed for a 50 percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated and evaluated graphically. IC 50 of Thymoquinone on MCF 7 was found to be at 31.2 µg/ml and Tamoxifen was at 62.5 µg/ml were as in combination therapy the IC 50 was found to be at 7.8 µg/ml. There is a remarkable reduction in concentration to achieve IC 50 percentage in combination therapy with a comparison with individual therapy. Therefore, the combination therapy of Thymoquinone and Tamoxifen on the MCF-7 cell line is more efficacious when compared to individual treatment on cell viability inhibition.

The continued conversion of glycerol to value-added chemicals is essential in ensuring the sustainable development of the biodiesel industry. Selective catalytic oxidation of glycerol to lactic acid provides an alternative approach to valorizing glycerol. A mesoporous SBA-15 supported mixed-metallic oxide catalyst is deemed essential to selectively produce lactic acid in this mixed parallel and multi-step reaction. SBA-15-supported bimetallic Ce and Zr oxides were proved to be highly efficient catalysts for the selective glycerol oxidation into lactic acid in base-free media. The synergism between Ce and Zr in the bimetallic oxide compounds could enhance the creation of oxygen vacancies in the catalyst via the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The 2:1CeZr/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited prominent catalytic activity in selectively oxidizing glycerol to lactic acid, with a glycerol conversion of 91.8% and a lactic acid yield of 35.1%. This work achieved superior catalytic performance compared to previously conducted studies, primarily due to the significantly higher initial glycerol concentration employed in this study. To ascertain the intrinsic active sites of the catalyst, the physicochemical properties of the catalyst were thoroughly examined using BET, FTIR, XRD, FESEM, TEM, CO2-TPD, O2-TPD, and H2-TPR analysis. This work concluded that the synergistic interaction of the active sites, which led to the formation of active oxygen species, facilitated primary dehydrogenation of the terminal -OH bond in glycerol. Hence, in this work, a plausible glycerol conversion mechanism over the 2:1CeZr/SBA-15 catalyst was also proposed.

For several decades now, research communities working on the climate, its changes, including current global warming, and its consequences have been recommending drastic reductions in human-made greenhouse gas emissions and, more generally, in the ecological footprint of human activities. This implies the implementation over the next 10 to 20 years of profound and rapid systemic transformations. The latest IPCC reports show that such transformations are only possible if they involve all parts/sectors of society. Given the existence of a range of ecological constraints and the foreseeable limits to scientific and technical advances, the transformations to be implemented must also include a strong component of sufficiency ("avoidance&#8221;).The IPSL (Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace) is a federation of academic research laboratories in the region of Paris, France, incl. CEREA, GEOPS, LATMOS, LISA, LMD, LOCEAN, LSCE, and METIS, which address all climate-relevant components of the Earth System, but also study other planets of the solar system. Since 2016, IPSL scientists and support staff have been working together along these lines to transform the institute's professional practices.&#160; This engagement is generally seen as : (i) a necessity: to initiate a transition in its research practices that will bring its professional behavior in line with the message of climate urgency that it has been diffusing for over 30 years; (ii) an opportunity: to accelerate the transition at a societal level by opening up new channels of exchange with society, encouraging collective action by example, and reinforcing the credibility of its warning message; (iii) a safeguard: collective bottom-up thinking at laboratory level to ensure that this transition takes place with maximum respect for our research practices and our well-being at work, and is not imposed by potentially inappropriate top-down measures.Achievements include (i) the development of methodologies for calculating the carbon footprint generated by staff activities and professional practices, (ii) concrete contributions to the reduction of the environmental footprint of professional travels, digital and high performance computing activities, purchases and finally observation of the earth. So far, the carbon footprint reduction efforts do not affect research methods, which constitute the core of the institute&#8217;s activity. However, the carbon emissions of the institute cannot be significantly reduced without a profound change in the way climate and planetary research are conducted, including data collection techniques (field campaigns, space missions, polar stations, etc), supercomputing, or laboratory instruments. The central question we are asking is: how do we continue to do new and interesting planetary science today while minimizing carbon emissions and other environmental impacts? A collective discussion around this thematic has been initiated in the IPSL; we will present here our approach, methodologies, achievements, and reflections at this stage, with the hope to stimulate exchange with other ongoing or emerging initiatives in other parts of the world.&#160;&#160;&#160;Figure 1: Carbon footprint of the IPSL for 2019, with the contribution of each category given in CO2 equivalent tons.

Presently, it is imperative to address global environmental challenges. The concerns are related to the depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels, greenhouse gases, and pollutant emissions. The transportation sector contributes significantly to these issues. In particular, the aviation industry primarily relies on jet fuel, a fossil fuel responsible for around 2% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. As a result, to address contemporary society environmental concerns and energy requirements, promising renewable and green energy sources are being intensively investigated, especially in air transportation. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), particularly biofuels, have been explored and indicated as a short-term solution to address the energy transition in the aviation sector. Implementing alternative fuels requires a deeper investigation regarding the spray dynamics. Following this, the present study explores conventional (Jet A-1) and alternative jet fuel (HVO) atomization, and the breakup length is explored in a wide range of operating conditions. The normalized mean breakup length was measured, and a correlation was proposed based on the experimental data. Additionally, the droplets released by the jet breakup are compared for both fuels in terms of diameter. Observations reveal the occurrence of jet flapping and bag breakup, affected by the air flowrate. The results also show that regardless of the fuel, increasing the momentum flux leads to a reduction in the normalized mean breakup length. An increase in the air flowrate promotes a shorter breakup length, resulting in a secondary droplet with smaller secondary droplet diameters. An empirical correlation was developed based on the fitting of the experimental data. This correlation indicates that the normalized mean breakup length exhibits a power law relation with M, which is consistent with the literature. This experimental study is essential to research on biofuels and aids in the development of new injectors and the precision of theoretical models integrated into numerical algorithms.

Reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction has attracted much attention as a potential approach for CO2 valorization via the production of synthesis gas, especially over Fe-modified supported Cu catalysts on CeO2. However, most studies have focused solely on investigating the RWGS reaction over catalysts with high Cu and Fe loadings, thus leading to an increase in the complexity of the catalytic system and, hence, preventing the gain of any reliable information about the nature of the active sites and reaction mechanism. In this work, a CeO2-supported single-atom Cu catalyst modified with iron was synthesized and evaluated for the RWGS reaction. The catalytic results reveal a significant synergistic effect between CuCeO2 and Fe, demonstrating an activity up to three times higher than the combined catalytic activities of monometallic catalysts (Fe/CeO2 + CuCeO2) under identical conditions. Various ex situ and in situ/operando techniques are employed to unveil the concealed role of Fe in catalyst activity enhancement. The combined findings from hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) reveal that the added Fe predominantly interacts with Cu-containing surface sites, resulting in the stabilization of higher proportions of Cu single sites. Near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and operando EPR results unveil a synergistic interplay of Fe with Cu-containing sites and CeOx domains, efficiently enhancing both the reoxidation of Cu+ in Cu+–Ov–Ce3+ moieties and the reducibility of Ce4+ in CeOx domains under RWGS conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the RWGS reaction predominantly proceeds via the redox mechanism.

Introduction and Objective: Obesity is a major social and economic problem. Since the 1980s, the number of overweight and obese people has doubled. Treatment of such patients is 30% more expensive than for people of normal weight. The main aim of the article is to present the impact of the occurrence of respiratory diseases and the deterioration of the system function. In addition, the article reviews the impact of physical activity and diet on weight loss and the prevention of further weight gain. Review and Methods: Review and summary of studies and meta-analysis of studies available in open-source format on Google Scholar and PubMed. Abbreviated Description of the State of Knowledge: One of the most common diseases in the population is bronchial asthma. People with excess body weight have a more severe course, and numerous studies have been carried out to explain the cause. The main mechanism that worsens respiratory function is mechanical compression by fatty tissue. It has also been observed that the inflammatory response, underlying the etiopathogenesis of asthma, may be caused by the secretion of inflammatory mediators by adipocytes. This is currently being investigated. Obstructive sleep apnea is a disorder that results in a fragmentation of sleep, which has serious health consequences and leads to a reduction in quality of life. Obesity is a major risk factor. The severity of the condition is strongly related to excess body weight. Obese hypoventilation syndrome is a condition in which obesity impairs alveolar ventilation and CO2 removal, resulting in hypercapnia, which can lead to respiratory failure. Summary: Weight loss and interventions to prevent weight gain in people with a baseline BMI >25 kg/m2 are fundamental to good health. For best results, a calorie-restricted diet should be combined with physical activity. The WHO has created recommendations for the amount of physical activity needed each week.

Electrocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and CO2 reduction reaction that are pivotal for the energy transition, are multi-step processes that occur in a nanoscale electric double layer (EDL) at a solid-liquid interface. Conventional analyses based on the Sabatier principle, using binding energies or effective electronic structure properties such as the d-band center as descriptors, are able to grasp overall trends in catalytic activity in specific groups of catalysts. However, thermodynamic approaches often fail to account for a plethora of electrolyte effects that arise in the EDL, including pH, cation, and anion effects. These effects have been observed to exert strong impacts on electrocatalytic reactions. There is growing consensus that the local reaction environment (LRE) prevailing in the EDL is the key to deciphering these complex and hitherto perplexing electrolyte effects. Increasing attention is thus paid to designing appropriate electrolytes, positioning the LRE at center stage. To this end, unraveling the LRE is becoming essential for designing electrocatalysts with specifically tailored properties, which could enable much needed breakthroughs in electrochemical energy science. Theory and modeling are getting more and more important and powerful in addressing this multifaceted problem that involves physical phenomena at different scales and interacting in a multidimensional parametric space. Theoretical models developed for this purpose should treat intrinsic multistep kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions, EDL effects from sub-nm scale to the scale of 10 nm, and mass transport phenomena bridging scales from < 0.1 to 100 μm. Given the diverse physical phenomena and scales involved, it is evident that the challenge at hand surpasses the capabilities of any single theoretical or computational approach. In this Account, we present a hierarchical theoretical framework to address the above challenge. It seamlessly integrates several modules: (i) microkinetic modelling that accounts for various reaction pathways; (ii) an LRE model that describes the interfacial region extending from the nanometric EDL continuously to the solution bulk; (iii) first-principles calculations that provide parameters, e.g., adsorption energies, activation barriers and EDL parameters. The microkinetic model considers all elementary steps without designating an a priori rate-determining step. The kinetics of these elementary steps are expressed in terms of local concentrations, potential and electric field that are co-determined by EDL charging and mass transport in the LRE model. Vital insights on electrode kinetic phenomena, i.e., potential-dependent Tafel slopes, cation effects, and pH effects, obtained from this hierarchical framework are then reviewed. Finally, an outlook on further improvement of the model framework is presented, in view of recent developments in first-principles based simulation of electrocatalysis, observations of dynamic reconstruction of catalysts, and machine-learning assisted computational simulations.

The paper is dedicated to power and environmental aspects of option the most appropriate types of fuel for supplying the economics of European countries and Ukraine. Accordingly notions about influence of C-containing fuels on greenhouse effect and on warming of environment, the existing tendency of substitution the fossil fuels — generally — and the natural gas — particularly — for methane-hydrogen mixtures is discussed as a controversial point. The problem of advancement the national fuel complexes is under consideration and has been studied with approach based upon the example of Ukrainian pre-war state of economics. An attention has been paid up on reduction of production and consumption of all types of the fossil fuels in the last decades, mainly due lowering the industrial using constituent. An enhancement of fuel using efficiency due improvement of furnace equipment basis provides an successive solution the fuel problems. The thermodynamic background for evaluation the efficiency of fuel using with account of the furnace’s non-ideality has been developed. The problem of “wet combustion” takes of special significance by the reason of weather and climate conditions’ account, on the one hand, and an opportunity to control the efficiency of fuel using, on the other hand, with new combined technique. The contemporary approach consists in combination the direct method of decrease the CO2 emission due exclusion of using the C-containing fuels (firstly — the fossil fuels) and with enhancement the efficiency of using the fossil fuels, for example due erection the recuperative heat recovery facilities with preliminary preheating of combustion air, in some advanced cases by combination with an air, humidification. The perspective ways of provision the decarbonization of environment consists in substitution the fossil fuels (mainly the natural gas NG) for hydrogen or H2-containing gas mixtures. The thermodynamic analysis of relevant technique has been carried out to estimate the opportunities of control the efficiency of hydrogen admixture to NG. Taking into account the variety of technologies of hydrogen production, the engineering method with giving of conditional coloration of hydrogen as a fuel has been considered. The “green” H2 makes the most valuable type of fuel (compared with “blue”, “turquoise”, “yellow”, “rose” colored and especially to the “grey” H2) as a substituting fuel from the standpoint of H2 fitness to process and plant. Particularly for high-temperature melting furnaces a provision of maximum emissivity of flame requires an using of carbon containing fuels to organize thermal pyrolysis of gas and soot formation within the combustion zone.

We can connect the metabolism of the first cells on Earth (Last Universal Common Ancestor, LUCA) to its geochemical roots through top-down comparative bioinformatics[1] and through bottom up geochemical laboratory studies, using minerals and inorganic redox partners (H2, metal ions) as predecessors of enzymes [2]. Our aim is to connect central metabolic cofactors and enzymatic reactions that were present in LUCA to early Earth geochemical reaction partners in order to better understand the transition from environmental reactions to genetically encoded metabolic functions. The hypothesis: cofactors are the missing link between abiotic and biotic (enzymatic) catalysis.In the presented studies, we focus on bridging abiotic and biotic hydrogen/electron transfer. Hydrogen gas, H2, is generated in various geochemical settings, among them serpentinization, a water-rock interaction process during which iron-containing minerals transfer electrons to the protons of water. H2 is also the electron donor for the most ancient route of biological CO2 fixation, the acetyl-CoA pathway. In metabolism itself, H2 is being transformed into biochemical electron donors, cofactors such as the dinucleotide NADH which can be seen &#8211; simply put &#8211; as hydride (H-) donors. We successfully activated hydrogen on minerals found in serpentinizing systems to reduce NAD+ to NADH under aqueous conditions [3].We transferred these principles onto other biochemical electron acceptors such as flavins and have furthermore shown unexpected mechanistic differences between the reduction of di- and mononucleotides.Our results establish a connection between central reactions in metabolism and abiotic, geochemical catalysis with hydrogen as a common denominator.&#160;&#160;References&#160;&#160;[1]&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; M.

Abstract Study question Melatonin (MLT) is a cytoprotective agent holding potential to prevent cadmium (Cd) toxicity and its impact in testicular function and fertility. Summary answer MLT produced a potent cytoprotective effect in Sertoli cells (SCs) exposed to Cd-toxicity, reducing its H2O2 generation and reductive stress effects by modulation Nrf2 activity. What is known already MLT a hormonal substance exhibiting strong antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties, has been proved to hold great potential as cytoprotec tive agent in a range of tissues and cell models exposed to Cd toxicity, including the rat bone, ovaries, human MSC, and even mammalian testes. However, cellular and mechanistic aspects of this effect of MLT in testes remain poorly understood. Cd is a pro-oxidant heavy metal reported to interfere with testicular function and fertility. Both the toxicity of Cd and the cytoprotective function of MLT involve redox-dependent mechanisms with the activity of Nrf2 transcription factor as key player on the cellular stress response. Study design, size, duration Porcine pre-pubertal SCs were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in the absence (unexposed-control group) or presence of 5 or 10µM CdCl2 (Sigma Chemical Co.) and/or 50nM MLT (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48h in HAMF12 (Euroclone) supplemented with 0.166nM retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and 5/500ml of Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS) + Premix (Cat. No. 354352; Corning). Participants/materials, setting, methods After treatment the parameters investigated in the study were: a) SCs viability (MTT test); b) SCs functionality parameters AMH and inhibin B. (real-time PCR and ELISA analysis); c) Intracellular and extracellular ROS production ( with Amplex Red and DCFH-DA fluorescent probe respectively); d) Catalase enzyme activity (spectrophotometric assay procedure); e) Nrf2 and other transcription factors (by semi-quantitative microplate confocal microscopy analysis); f) Intracellular and extracellular levels of GSH and other thiols (by HPLC); g) c-Jun and ERK1/2 (Immunoblot). Main results and the role of chance MLT co-treatment significantly prevented the effects of Cd on cell viability and abnormal ROS production. The reduction of H2O2 efflux was very important and combined with an increased CAT activity that was demonstrated upon MLT treatment significantly in SCs exposed to 5μMCd. The co-treatment with MLT compared to Cd treatment, showed a trend toward a significant recovery of AMH and inhibin B gene expression and secretion levels, respectively, demonstrating the cytoprotective effect of MLT in SCs exposed to Cd toxicity at the functional level. In Cd-treated cells, MLT significantly reduced the expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 protein, and decreased GSTP induction. However, MLT reduced Cys uptake and stimulated GSH efflux when the cells were treated with 10 µM Cd, suggesting a specific role for the Nrf2-GSTP axis in the cytoprotective response to MLT of Cd-treated SCs. Finally MLT induced MAPK-ERK1-2 pathway and c-Jun transcription factor when the cells were treated with Cd. MLT is a cytoprotective agent in SCs exposed to Cd toxicity capable to restore cell viability and function. Its activity is associated with the modulation of Nrf2 and other stress response genes important in the control of thiols and H2O2 metabolism of SCs, including cJun and MAPKs. Limitations, reasons for caution Other ROS-scavenging genes other than CAT may have a role in the antioxidant response to MLT of SCs, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxyredoxins that are worth investigating further. Wider implications of the findings The aspects that emerged from our study and, described for the first time in these cells, warrant further preclinical and clinical investigation holding potential in the treatment of Cd-induced testicular damage and fertility problems.

Drought is a defining feature of the Mediterranean climate, characterized by frequent periods of precipitation significantly below average. However, the ongoing drought episode affecting Catalonia shows a severity never recorded in the instrumental period 1915-2023. In the case of the city of Barcelona, where precipitation data stretches back to 1786, one must go back to the early 19th century to find a similar 3-year drought period.&#160; Observing the trend of drought episodes over last few decades, the current drought is the latest in a series of episodes of shorter duration and intensity, but which can be also locally classified as exceptional at the time of their occurrence. Consequently, some areas of North-eastern Catalonia have endured conditions similar to semi-permanent drought over the past decade, or even beyond.&#160; The current drought in Catalonia is not an isolated event but part of a broader regional pattern. In general, the entire South-western Europe and Northern Africa have been under drought conditions to a greater or lesser extent in recent years (Faranda et al, 2023). Moreover, other Mediterranean climate regions across the globe, such as Central Chile and California, have lately witnessed record-breaking droughts during the instrumental period, some being classified as Megadroughts (Garreaud et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2022).&#160; More recently, some authors (Cook et al, 2022) have further explored the concept of Megadrought. These episodes have common characteristics beyond their impacts that justify this qualification, including remarkable temporal persistence, unprecedented nature compared with previous events, links with external climatic forcings, or their connection with SST anomalies. &#160; Currently, the global climate system is strongly forced by the increase in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Climate projections point to a reduction in precipitation for the Mediterranean climate area, which, combined with the increase in temperature values, will lead to greater aridity and the occurrence of droughts with a magnitude never recorded before. In light of these projections and the characteristics exhibited by the current Catalan drought, the question arises: Is Catalonia facing a Megadrought episode?&#160; REFERENCES Cook, B.I., Smerdon, J.E., Cook, E.R. et al.

The fishery-photovoltaic complementary industry is an emerging industrial model in China that integrates aquaculture with the solar industry. This innovative model involves conducting aquaculture activities while installing photovoltaic modules on the water surface to harness solar energy for electricity generation. However, despite its rapid growth in China, this model lacks substantial scientific data support across various domains. Therefore, based on an analysis of relevant research literature, this study reviews the current development status, environmental and economic effects, as well as challenges faced by the fishery-photovoltaic complementary industry in China. The aim is to provide scientific references for promoting sustainable development within this sector. The findings reveal that existing fishery-photovoltaic complementary industry projects are primarily concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Pearl River Basin. The geographical distribution of these projects is predominantly influenced by local aquaculture areas and available solar energy resources, with a greater impact observed from the former rather than the latter. During summer months when water is shaded by photovoltaic panels, a slight decrease in the average water quality parameters across cases was observed, such as a decrease of 0.2 units in pH, a decrease of 1.06 °C in water temperature, a decrease in dissolved oxygen levels of 0.8 mg/L, inorganic nitrogen content and total phosphorus concentration dropped by 0.08mg/L and 0.02mg/L respectively. Conversely, there is a moderate increase noted in total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen levels. The conclusion of the effect on phytoplankton biomass is not uniform, but it will certainly reduce zooplankton biomass. The impact on the species diversity of the zooplankton community was minimal, and its direction, whether positive or negative, varied depending on the specific aquatic ecosystem. A certain degree of shade is advantageous for the cultivation of shade-loving fish. Through the strategic deployment of photovoltaic panels and the implementation of scientific stocking practices, it is possible to achieve sustained levels of fisheries production. This model also can reduce an average of 978.6 tons of CO2 emissions per megawatt per year through energy production, thus achieving the combined goals of energy conservation and emissions reduction, and ensuring the profitability of power generation. Additionally, compared with the land utilization area of 3.66 hm2 per megawatt of traditional ground-mounted photovoltaics, fishery-photovoltaic complementary only requires 1.64 hm2, which can significantly save land resources by utilizing water surfaces, which mitigates the conflict between land use for agriculture and renewable energy installations. At the same time, research also pointed out that the existence of fishery-photovoltaic complementary will inevitably have some negative impacts on bird communities. Economic analyses indicate that while initial infrastructure costs and long payback periods pose challenges, the overall economic feasibility is promising, especially with governmental support and technological advancements. However, several challenges need to be addressed for further development: these include difficulties associated with infrastructure construction and initial costs, long payback periods; insufficient experience and technical support; as well as a lack of research on ecological and environmental impacts - particularly an urgent need for comprehensive life cycle assessments encompassing both environmental and economic aspects. Future research should focus on life cycle assessments, improved PV technology integration, and optimized aquaculture practices.

Abstract Study question Do Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) supplements impose methylating conditions that influence methylation and transcriptomic profiles during preimplantation period of mouse embryos? Summary answer Subtle differences in embryo methylation profiles were induced by FOCM supplements, despite transcriptomic signatures remained stable and selective genes related to metabolism were activated. What is known already Previous human studies of populations affected by seasonal variations in diet including folate availability have shown methylation changes in specific loci known as metastable epialleles (MEs). MEs exhibit stability across tissues, indicating these could be potential biosensors for heightened sensitivity to external methylating influences in early embryonic stages. Despite significant progress in IVF embryo culture conditions, the sensitivity to the outer metabolic environment during the extensive genomic transformation of embryo reprogramming remains inadequately understood. Study design, size, duration This is a prospective experimental study conducted from January 2023 to December 2023. A total of 111 fresh mouse zygotes (F1 hybrid (B6/CBA)) were subjected embryo culture conditions with different FOCM supplies of 5-MTHF and betaine up to expanded blastocyst stage (105 hours). At different timepoints, individual embryos were collected and disaggregated in individual cells for downstream single-cell analysis. Participants/materials, setting, methods Mouse zygotes were collected from the oviduct, washed and culture in KSOM supplemented with 5-MTHF and betaine at respectively concentrations of 50μM and 50μg/mL (THF/bet(50)), 10μM and 10μg/mL (THF/bet(10)) and no supplement till blastocyst stage at 37 °C, 6%CO2 and 5%O2. Individual embryos were collected at 2 cells, 4 cells, 8 cells, Morula and Blastocyst stage and disaggregated into single cells for subsequent single-cell RNAseq (SmartSeq2) and single-cell methylome analysis through Splinted Ligation Adapter Tagging (scSPLAT). Main results and the role of chance The methylation analysis conducted though scSPLAT revealed a comprehensive reduction in global methylation levels throughout developmental stages. Notably, zygotes exhibited a maximal proportion of methylated cytosines at CpG sites, while blastocysts displayed minimal methylation levels, with sporadic increases in isolated cells. Quantitative profiling indicated lower methylation intensities in treated embryos from zygote to 4 cells, followed by a reversal trend from 8 cells to blastocyst, suggestive of an enhanced assimilation of one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) supplements. Transcriptomic profiles obtained through scRNAseq exhibited correlation with developmental trajectories from zygote to blastocyst. However, no discernible variations were attributed to the combined exposure of Betaine and 5-MTHF. Gene enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes at various timepoints highlighted specific metabolic responses, including mitochondrial oxidative stress and variations in glutathione metabolism. This suggests that the folate forms utilized in this study may possess a protective role as antioxidants, contributing to the observed effects on gene expression during embryonic development. Limitations, reasons for caution The methylation analysis shown in this study was a pilot carried out with low coverage of sequencing deepness, further analysis are ongoing to increase reads coverage. Wider implications of the findings Exposure of mouse embryos to FOCM enhanced global methylation during cell division from 8 cells to blastocyst, indicating heightened assimilation during DNA synthesis. While the transcriptomic signature remained stable, increased expression of genes linked to mitochondrial oxidative stress and glutathione metabolism suggests FOCM’s potential antioxidant role.

Simulations of spectra during a volcanic eventThe composition and the variability of the lower atmosphere of Venus are critical to understanding the surface-atmosphere interactions, the atmospheric evolution and the volatile exchanges between the interior and the atmosphere [1, 2, 3]. The lower atmosphere can be investigated on the near-infrared spectral windows on the nightside, centered at 1.18 &#181;m (0-15 km), 1.74 &#181;m (20-30 km) and 2.3 &#181;m (30-45 km) [4, 5], which provides a chance to detect volcanic species such as H2O, SO2. CO, HCl and HF, which are common species on Earth volcanoes [3]. The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) [6, 7, 8] was used to simulate the nightside 2.3 &#181;m spectrum of Venus, in nadir-geometry, using a VIRA atmospheric template for temperature and molecular vertical abundance profiles and four aerosol modes, of effective radii of 0.49 &#181;m, 1.18 &#181;m, 1.56 &#181;m and 4.25 &#181;m [9, 10]. The spectral resolution was defined as R = 7500. An H2O volcanic gas plume was modeled using a Johnson unbounded distribution, with a maximum value of volume mixing ratio (vmr) at a chosen altitude and a slow decrease towards lower altitudes. The profile was defined as a perturbation of the VIRA nominal H2O profile (~ 30 ppm). with a peak vmr in the range 10-70 ppm and a peak altitude in the range 10-58 km. For each plume, the total integrated column density was conserved, defined as a scaler of the VIRA value, N(total)(H2O) ~ 13.23 kg m-2. An H2O plume at Z = 30 km with a 10 ppm peak increase results in a radiance difference of ~ 10% at 4150 cm-1. Ground-based observations and future space missions, such as iSHELL/IRTF and EnVision&#8217;s VenSpec-H spectrograph [11], respectively, should have the high-spectral resolution and sensitivity required to detect such H2O variations due to a possible volcanic eruption event. Spectral Retrievals of iSHELL/IRTF spectraOn this framework, we are currently investigating the sensitivity of iSHELL/IRTF to retrieve the abundance of H2O and its temporal and latitudinal variability using the near-infrared spectral window at 1.74 &#181;m (20-30 km) and 2.3 &#181;m (30-45 km) [4]. The retrieval is ongoing with the ASIMUT tool (Vandaele+2006) [12].We performed 6 hours of observations, in February 2nd-3rd 2024, of Venus dayside and nightside using the K3 (2.26-2.55 &#181;m) and H3 filters (1.64-1.82 &#181;m) on the iSHELL/IRTF instrument. The slit width used was 0.375&#8217;&#8217; x 5&#8217;&#8217; (R ~ 75 000) and it was positioned parallel to the axis of rotation. iSHELL is a cross-dispersed high-spectral resolution 1.1-5.3 &#181;m echelle spectrograph (R ~ 80 000), located in Maunakea, Hawaii [13]. Wavelength calibration, flat fielding, dark correction and sky subtraction were performed using the Spextool data reduction software [14, 15].The dayside straylight contribution on the nightside, in order 306, was removed by scaling of the dayside spectra with a scaler computed as the nightside/dayside ratio, in order 295 (1.764-1.771 &#181;m), where we modeled expected counts ~ 0.We identified several CO2 absorption lines in order 306 (1.702&#8211;1.709 &#181;m) and 305 (1.708-1.714 &#181;m) and some hints of H2O and HCl absorption lines in order 300 (1.735-1.742 &#181;m). The absolute flux calibration and retrieval of the H2O and HCl column densities are currently ongoing, using ASIMUT [12].References. (1) Gilmore et al. 2023, Space Sci Rev.

Linking the taxonomic classification of comets with their dynamic classification is somehow still debated. Comets are historically distinguished in: typical and carbon-depleted based on A&#8217;Hearn et al. (1985) work. Fink (2009) has further distinguished three other types of comets: Tempel 1 type, Giacobini-Zimmer type and the unusual Yanaka object.However, recent Solar System formation models (Brasser and Morbidelli 2013) indicate that comets are derived from the same parent population, i.e. the primordial trans-neptunian disc, before being scattered in the two main reservoirs of Oort Cloud and Scattered disk. This might suggest that the observed differences are evolutionary rather than primordial.&#160;Cometary outgassing is dependent on the activity, that is, the abundance of various species of volatiles subliming from the nucleus varies with heliocentric distances and this significantly influences our classification and deserves better understanding.&#160;Long Period Comets (LPCs) have been found to be already active very far away from the Sun, as far as 26 AU (Jewitt et al. 2019; Hui et al. 2018; Hui et al. 2019) and data analysis suggests that their activity must have started as far as 35 AU (Jewitt et al. 2021). At those heliocentric distances, the temperatures are too cold to allow water ice to sublimate. Despite other mechanisms are at study, the sublimation of supervolatile ices like CO2 and CO, which are among the most abundant ices in comets after water (e.g. Bockel&#233;e-Morvan et al. 2017), is believed to be responsible for this distant activity (e.g. Fulle et al. 2020A; Fulle et al. 2020B; Bodewits et al. 2015; Ootsubo et al. 2012).&#160;However a full understanding of the processes driving the cometary activity from far away from the Sun to the perihelion distance is still to be fully understood and the subtle differences among individual comets often seem to prevail with respect to a common pathway. Therefore, given the small statistics available, each individual addition is going to be very helpful and valuable to build a comprehensive insight of these processes.Here we present visible and near-IR spectroscopic characterization of a sample of more than 10 comets of different dynamical classes (JFC, Halley, Oort cloud) observed at various heliocentric distances (from 1 to 6 AU) using TNG with Dolores and NICS instruments covering the spectral ranges from 300 to 2500 nm.Preliminary reduction indicates a large variety of behaviors from very faint and inactive objects to typically CN-dominated objects to peculiar objects such as C/2016 R2.C/2016 R2 has been shown by several authors (e.g. Cochran &amp; MacKay 2018; Opitom et al. 2019) to be a quite unique water-poor object rich in CO+/N2+. However, only recently an updated fluorescence emission model of CO+ has been published (Bromley et al., 2024).Additionally, modern calculations seem to suggest that such N2-rich comets might nevertheless be more common than we expected (Anderson et al. 2023) and could also be the key to understand the long-dated problem of the N2-depletion of comets with respect to the protosolar nebula.We present additional observations of this peculiar comet and other more typical comets that will be used to further constrain the models of the emission mechanisms and to obtain a better understanding of cometary composition and evolution.&#160;ReferencesA&#8217;Hearn, M. et al. 1985.

Introduction : Martian H2O, CO2 and dust cycles are key processes in modern climate dynamics. The polar caps [1], as well as their icy outliers (that can take the form of convex-shaped ice mounds inside deep craters) are the current, major, exposed volatiles reservoirs. Unanswered questions remain about the mass balance of the caps. Concerning outliers, such as the ice domes of Louth and Korolev craters[2,3], the prevailing hypothesis suggests a build up by atmospheric deposition [4]. If accurate, these icy mounds could record past climate&#160; conditions while still responding to present-day Martian climate change because of their southerly location [5].&#160; They therefore offer unique opportunities to study volatiles dynamics, with different boundary conditions than those of the north or south caps.Research question : Our study takes advantage of the Exomars Trace Gas Orbiter &#8211; Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System&#160; (CaSSIS) [6] colour imaging capabilities to evaluate pluri-annual ice changes, especially water frost and dust coverage at Louth and Korolev craters ice mounds. Those changes can serve as a proxy of local dynamics, which can reveal important information about ice and dust cycles.General methods:CaSSIS is the high-resolution stereoscopic camera of ESA&#8217;s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). It possesses 4 broad band filters across the visible range : BLU (497nm), PAN (677nm), RED (835nm) and NIR (940nm). The orbit of TGO being non-Sun-synchronous, it allows us to acquire images of the same region of interest at different seasons and local times, at 4.6 m/pixel with high a&#160; signal-to-noise ratio, and therefore allows to monitor diurnal phenomena until 74&#176;N. The first step of the study consists of a morphological and spectral analysis of 25 Louth crater images, that cover MY34 to MY37.Visible reflectance features of water ice include an average high reflectance, relatively constant over the VIS range, as well as asymmetric overtone absorption bands at 800nm, 840nm, and 1030nm. In CaSSIS colors, the strongest signature of water ice is the reduction of the strong visible red slope of the dust. It has been demonstrated experimentally that CaSSIS color criteria can help differentiate&#160; between different types of ice and dust mixings [7].&#160;Observational results&#160; :&#160;In accordance with previous studies, [5,8], Louth ice mound appears generally homogeneous, with little to no significant spatial variations in its global albedo and colour. This is not the case in two particular observations, taken on 15.02.2022, and on 28.03.2022, respectively. A dark pattern appeared and displayed changes in the eastern direction (in Fig.1, the red circle shows the area of change).&#160;Fig.1 : Two CaSSIS images (MY36_018836_078 and MY36_018951_106) of Louth crater,&#160;taken in early martian autumn. The two images are NIR/PAN/BLU composites.&#160;We searched for reports of similar events in the literature, and only found one study [9] reporting an &#8216;unexplained dark patterning evolution&#8217; in MRO - CTX images. We found other occurrences of dark patterns in MRO - HiRISE [10], in 2010, 2022, and 2023. Fig. 2 displays two examples of observations, both with HiRISE and CTX, in 2022 and 2023.Fig.2: Two occurrences of dark patterns in 2022 (A) and 2023 (B)The CTX observation shown in Fig.2 A was taken 14 days before the CaSSIS image MY36_018836_078 shown in Fig 1. A notable&#160; eastward progression can be distinguished.Each occurrence is different in shape, shows&#160; strong seasonality (appears at the end of summer, evolves through the autumn equinox), as well as rapid evolution (~tens of Martian days). The dark patterns disappear during each wintertime, showing a white &#160;mound each following spring. This indicates that the mechanism that produces these patterns is related to seasonal effects.Preliminary spectral measurements of the ice in CaSSIS images show that the signal is largely dominated by the dust signature. We hypothesize that the dark marks could be caused by either deposition from the adjacent dune field, or local sublimation events.What&#8217;s next ? &#160;While continuing on spectral analysis with CaSSIS, we would like to explore the NOMAD [11] dataset to search if outliers in atmospheric water vapor content are correlated with the dark patterns occurrences. A &#8216;cloud&#8217; can be seen in the MY36_018951_106 observation displayed in Fig.1. We do not know if this is linked to the formation of the North Polar Hood, or to the event itself. Thirdly, we will make use of the Mars Climate Database [12] to explore the temperature and relative humidity fields around Louth. Lastly, we will perform a similar study on Korolev crater. It is less clear than in Louth, but some structures appearing in early autumn resemble the ones that have been described here.Acknowledgments:This work has been developed in the framework of the National Center for Competence in Research PlanetS funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).CaSSIS is a project of the University of Bern and funded through the Swiss Space Office via ESA's PRODEX programme.

This systematic review aimed to summarise the evidence for severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and maternal mortality (MM) in women who are socio-economically disadvantaged compared to those who are not, in high-income countries. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo databases. Peer-reviewed papers from observational studies were included. A narrative synthesis and meta-analyses of comparable studies, structured around the different definitions of socio-economic disadvantage and type of outcome (SMM or MM) were undertaken. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa tool. Results: The final review included 49 papers; 27 cohort studies, 10 case-control and four cross-sectional and eight National Maternal Mortality Surveillance Programs. 30 papers reported SMM and 22 MM, as the outcome. In the meta-analyses, in the most compared to the least amount of neighbourhood deprivation, neighbourhood income, neighbourhood poverty and low education, the odds of SMM were 1.45 (95% CI 1.13–1.85), 1.44 (95% CI 1.32–1.57), 1.61 (95% CI 0.97–2.66) and 1.33 (95% CI 1.19–1.49) respectively. In the most compared to the least amount of unemployment, neighbourhood deprivation, lowest occupational group and low education the odds of MM were 1.86 (95% CI 0.95–3.66), 2.10 (95% CI 1.57–2.81), 1.61 (95% CI 1.03–2.51), 1.90 (95% CI 1.29–2.79) respectively. Discussion: Across high-income countries there is a consistent association between socio-economic disadvantage and SMM and MM. Further research is needed to identify targeted interventions to reduce increased risk. 9 Virtual reality for the management of pain and anxiety during manual vacuum aspiration: A randomized control trial Shereen Ibrahim1; Anna Mcdougall2; Eleanor Bard3; Deo Nandita4; Schahrazed Rouabhi5 1Lister Hospital, Stevenage, United Kingdom; 2Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, United Kingdom; 3Barnet Hospital, London, United Kingdom; 4Barts NHS Hospital, London, United Kingdom; 5North Middlesex University Hospital, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) stands as an effective outpatient alternative for managing miscarriage and retained products of conception. Virtual Reality (VR), a novel intervention, has emerged as a potential distraction technique for pain management in ambulatory gynaecology settings. Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 50-eligible women scheduled for MVA across two hospital sites. Participants were randomized into standard care or VR intervention groups, with stratification by site, BMI and parity. Data were collected through questionnaires, numerical rating scales, and audio-recorded interviews. Statistical analysis utilized quantitative comparisons and qualitative analysis of interview content. Results: Out of 72-women approached, 50 (69%) were randomized, with exclusion primarily due to language barriers. Baseline characteristics showed balance between VR and standard groups. Pain and anxiety scores pre-procedure were similar in both groups. No significant differences in experienced pain or anxiety were observed between the VR and standard care groups. Patient feedback revealed 100% positive experiences with VR, reporting reduced anxiety (91%) and pain distraction (73%). However, no statistical significance was found in self-reported pain or anxiety scores between the groups. Reasons for this discrepancy may include varying pain perceptions during MVA and incomplete immersion in the VR world. Conclusion: The VR intervention was well-received by participants, with reported reductions in anxiety and perceived pain distraction. Despite positive patient experiences, no statistically significant variance in pain or anxiety scores was identified between the VR and standard care groups. Further investigations are warranted to discern the impact of VR immersion on pain management. 10 Obstetric and perinatal outcomes in women with Turner's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis Alicia Walker1, Zachary Nash1,2; Hajra Khattak1,2; Bassel Wattar3,4; Aviva Petrie5; Melanie Davies1,2 1UCL Institute for Women's Health, London, United Kingdom; 2Reproductive Medicine Unit, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing, University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom; 3Beginnings Assisted Conception Unit, Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, London, United Kingdom; 4Institute for Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London, London, United Kingdom; 5University College London, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Turner's Syndrome (TS) affects 1 in 2,000 live female births. The 2017 'Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Care of Girls and Women with Turner Syndrome' acknowledges women with TS possess an increased risk of adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. However, no overall risk estimate for each outcome has been reported. This study reports pooled risk for each outcome and compares risk between egg donation and spontaneous pregnancies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with a prospectively registered protocol, under PRISMA Guidelines. 30 studies reporting obstetric or perinatal outcomes of pregnancies in women with TS were included. Eligibility screening was conducted by 2 independent reviewers. Obstetric and perinatal outcome data was extracted and tabulated using a standard proforma. Results: 1724 pregnancies were included. Pooled risks: Obstetric outcomes: caesarean section (62.8%) (95% CI: 57–76%), pregnancy-associated hypertensive disorders (21%) (95% CI: 13–29%), pre-eclampsia (10%) (95% CI: 6–14%), gestational diabetes mellitus (6.0%) (95% CI: 4–8%), aortic dissection (1.1%) (95% CI: 0–2%), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (4.6%) (95% CI: 0–7%), post-partum haemorrhage (17.9%) (95% CI: −3 to 37%), and maternal mortality (0.3%) (95% CI: 0–1%). Perinatal outcomes: prematurity (14.1%) (95% CI: 8–18%), low birthweight (25.1%) (95% CI: 12–23%), and perinatal mortality (1.2%) (95% CI: 0–1%). Egg-donation pregnancies yield significantly higher rates of: caesarean section (82.8% vs. 55.7%) (RR 1.49) (95% CI: 1.27–1.76), pregnancy-associated hypertensive disorder (33.0% vs 12.9%: p = 0.001), pre-eclampsia (16.9% vs 8.2%: p = 0.0023), gestational hypertension (17.9% vs 0.0%: p = 0.082), low-birthweight (43.0% vs 1.9%: p < 0.001) and preterm birth (17.5% vs 0.0%: p < 0.001) than spontaneous pregnancies. Multiple pregnancies resulted in high rates of prematurity (70.0%), low birth-weight (73.3%) and pregnancy-associated hypertensive disorders (60.9%). Conclusion: TS women experience high rates of pregnancy complications. Risks are increased in egg donation pregnancies and multiple pregnancies compared to singleton spontaneous pregnancies. 22 Teaching of undergraduate medical students in obstetrics and gynaecology: Enablers and deterrents for clinicians in women's health Sophie Bracke1; Prithi Uthayananthan2; Simran Jolly2; Irene Gafson1 1Whittington Health, London, United Kingdom; 2University College London, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Ensuring high-quality undergraduate education in Obstetrics and Gynaecology is essential for cultivating proficient healthcare professionals and generating interest in the specialty. To optimise educational delivery, it is crucial to comprehend factors that enable and deter staff engagement in medical education. Methods: An online, anonymised survey was conducted in November 2023 amongst midwives and doctors within a London Obstetrics & Gynaecology department. Collected data included staff designation, levels of enablement and deterrence of various teaching-related factors, frequency of interaction with medical students, and suggestions for enhancing teaching effectiveness. Results: Twenty staff members (12 midwives, 8 doctors) participated, highlighting the role of teaching enjoyment and students' enthusiasm as primary enablers. Conversely, the perception of students attending solely for specific sign-offs emerged as significant deterrents. Mixed results were observed for other enablers (e.g., feedback, senior support) and deterrents (e.g., punctuality issues, lack of reward). Free-text responses highlighted the need for enhanced communication between staff and the medical school, especially regarding curriculum and timetable awareness. Conclusion: This study identifies key factors which enable or deter the teaching of medical students, emphasising the role of factors such as enthusiastic students and enjoyment of teaching. Recognising factors that enable and deter staff member from teaching offers opportunities for targeted improvements in education. In order to address shortcomings regarding enablers or deterrents identified, a student-led teaching handbook was developed, and a dedicated teaching session occurred to update staff on learning needs of students. Ongoing student feedback demonstrates upward-trending student satisfaction with their clinical placement. 28 Trainee management of undiagnosed emergency placenta accrete spectrum PASD Anas Alojayli1; Chineze Otigbah2; Sorina Bologa1; Michael Magro1 1Queen's Hospital, Romford, United Kingdom; 2Queen's Hospital, Romford, United Kingdom Background: Teaching video to show how to manage emergency presentations of placenta accrete spectrum disorder (PASD) by a trainee on call duty. This video consists of two parts; the first part will be presented by the trainee and the steps should the trainee do, and the second part will be presented by the consultant. Short video to show pre-op preparation, identification of PASD intra-operatively, delivery of the baby, use of simple vaso-occulsive techniques, managing the affected area by wedge resection (excision) and managing transfusion including the use of cell salvage and post op complications. Method: Video presentation of one case showing how to excise an anterior PASD. This includes. Identification of a PASD in an emergency How to proceed to delivering the fetus avoiding the placenta, (pre-op mapping, fundal classical incision) and closing the incision. The use of simple vaso-occlusive techniques in an emergency (flexible ligatures). Results: The stepwise method of pre-op ultrasound placental mapping, recognising features of PASD and avoiding the area by applying a fundal incision delivering the baby and closing the incision with placenta in-situ. This method helps in an emergency to reduce maternal morbidity and facilitated the fertility sparing surgery, reduced length of stay needs for intensive care and morbidity. This video should enable trainees to learn how to manage these conditions in an emergency. Conclusion: These video aim to show how to manage these conditions in a stepwise manner with techniques that can be used in low resource countries saving lives. 31 Say no to wasting N2O, Entonox waste reduction project Amy Manning; Katherine Whitehouse Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom Introduction: Entonox is a valuable, versatile analgesic and has unique properties to support a woman in labour. However, N2O is a significant potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. 1 kg N2O is equivalent to 298 kg CO2. It is a medical gas that is exhaled by the patient virtually unchanged and remains stable in the atmosphere for 115 years. Entonox has occupational hazards to staff, it's associated with miscarriage and B12 deficiency. A significant proportion of Entonox is wasted before it even reaches the patient, in the pipework and the bedheads. Methods: A team was set up, an anaesthetist, estates manager, pharmacist and obstetric and gynaecology trainee. Tests had been carried out on the pipework system and leaks identified and fixed. However, a functioning demand valve can leak 2 litres per minute and a faulty valve may exceed this without audibility. It was decided to focus on asking staff to unplug at the bedheads when not in use. Signs were made to place next to each plug in site. Educational posters and information distributed to all staff. Results: In November 2023 one cylinder less of Entonox was used from simply unplugging at the bedheads. One cylinder per month equates to 195,300 liters Entonox per year. Conclusion: As O&G doctors our aim is to bring healthy babies into the world, we should be bringing them into a healthy world. Simple changes in our practice can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare, reduce costs and staff exposure. 34 The management of menopause in women with a history of breast cancer at Guy's Tertiary Menopause Clinic Sarah Aulds; Deborah Bruce; Debra Holloway; Janice Rymer Guy's and St Thomas Hospital, London, United Kingdom Introduction: The HABITS trial reported that HRT increased the risk of breast cancer recurrence. However, no studies have reported an increased mortality rate, thus questioning its use. The risk of recurrence with HRT is thought to be higher in women with previous hormone receptor positive disease. Methods: Women with a history of breast cancer were assessed over six months at Guy's Hospital. The hormone status, treatment of breast cancer, menopausal symptoms and management options were assessed. Results: Lifestyle counselling, trials of vaginal moisturisers and referral to our psychosexual service where indicated were offered to all 43 women. In 23% of women, solely lifestyle modifications and vaginal moisturisers were advocated. In 42% of women struggling with predominantly vasomotor symptoms venlafaxine was initiated. Oxybutynin was prescribed in 12% of women with associated genitourinary symptoms. Gabapentin was prescribed for 9% who suffered with bony joint pains. In a third of women prescribed non-hormonal medications, a vaginal oestrogen was also prescribed. Intrarosa was given in 2% of women with severe vaginal dryness. Transdermal HRT was commenced in 12% of women with symptoms severely impairing their quality of life. Conclusion: Lifestyle modifications, psychosexual counselling and non-hormonal treatment always formed the first line of treatment. Venlafaxine was the most prescribed medication in this cohort. Interestingly, the hormone receptor status did not seem to impact the decision; the 12% of women who were started on HRT all had a history of hormone receptor positive breast cancer. All forms of oestrogen were avoided in women on aromatase inhibitors. 35 "Does my baby look big in this?" An investigation of the accuracy of estimated fetal weight (EFW) on ultrasound scan in suspected large (LGA) babies compared to appropriately grown (AGA) babies, at a North London Hospital in 2020 Ellie Bard1; Edwin Ruhinda2; Deepa Janga2 1Barnet Hospital, London, United Kingdom; 2North Middlesex University Hospital, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Big babies are at increased risk of difficult births. However, the baby's size is uncertain until birth. Methods: The LGA dataset included all women presenting in June-August 2020 with customised EFW >90th centile or AC >95th centile at >34 weeks' gestation, and EFW >90th centile at final scan (n = 91). The AGA dataset included all babies born in 2020 with EFW obtained within four weeks of birth; and normal fetal size, growth and liquor at final scan (n = 414). We calculated actual and absolute (positive) percentage scan error using birthweight and a growth-adjusted projection formula. Analysis with STATA-12 used t-tests, chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results: The datasets were similar regarding gestation at final scan, scan-to-birth interval, maternal age and BMI. Birthweights were higher among suspected LGAs: mean 3.72 kg compared to 3.27 kg, p < 0.001. 31/91 (34.1%) babies in the LGA group were LGA at birth. EFWs were generally over-estimated, and EFW error was higher in the LGA group: mean actual error +9.6% compared to +5.6%, p < 0.001. The proportion of observations within 10%, 15% and 20% absolute error margins were significantly lower in the LGA group: 52.8%, 75.8% and 87.9% compared to 71%, 90.8% and 96.9% in the AGA group, p-values < 0.001. Mode of birth was significantly different: 35% vaginal and 61.6% caesarean among LGAs compared to 61.7% vaginal and 32.7% caesarean among AGAs, p < 0.001. Conclusion: Most suspected LGA babies are normal size at birth. EFW error was greater in suspected LGA babies. Women need counselling about the uncertainty in EFW to enable informed birth choices. 41 10 Year review of the prognostic characteristics and recurrence patterns of G1 endometrial carcinoma; large retrospective analysis of a tertiary centre Negin Sadeghi1,2; Andreas Zouridis1; Kianoush Zarrindej1; Chritina Pappa1; Ammara Kashif1; Sarah Smyth2; Alisha Sattar1; Stephen Damato1; Mostafa Abdalla1; Susan Addley1; Sean Kehoe1; Hooman Soleymani Majd1 1Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom; 2Frimley Health NHS Trust, Slough, United Kingdom Introduction: Grade 1 (G1) endometrial cancer (EC) are well differentiated cells which, most are confined to the uterus and ovary (stage 1), hence mainly treated with surgery alone and often in benign gynaecology service. The aim of this study is to evaluate the independent risk factors for recurrence and mortality and to describe the recurrence patterns. Methods: Data from 238 cases of G1 endometrial cancer who were operated at Oxford University Hospitals between 2009 and 2019, were analysed. We used independent samples t-test to compare continuous variables and Pearson chi-square or Fisher's extract test for categorical variables. Survival rates were calculated from Kaplan–Meier curves and compared using log-rank tests. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted to assess the potential risk factors for relapse and mortality. Results: 14/238 cases had recurrence (5.88%) with Cancer specific death rate of 2/238 = 0.84%. Mean time interval from surgery until relapse was 30 months and half the patients were asymptomatic, with relapse occurring mainly in the vaginal vault. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that only depth of myometrial invasion >50% (p value 0.049) and serosal breach (p value 0.017) were independent risk factors of recurrence in our study. Conclusion: Despite the overall promising outcome of G1 EC, recurrence rate is 2–26% worldwide. Identifying independent risk factors, aid planning of surgery, need for surgical staging and targeted therapy. We emphasise the importance of regular follow up to detect early symptoms of recurrence and increase overall survival. 58 Endometriosis and the complications of pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis Bethany Parry1; Chloe Stone1; Amy Newnham-Hill1,2; Siobhan Quenby1,2; Joshua Odendaal1,2 1Warwick Medical School, Coventry, United Kingdom; 2University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, United Kingdom Introduction: Endometriosis is a prevalent gynaecological condition. It's pathophysiology, whilst unclear, is in part immune-mediated. It has previously been associated with infertility but its role in obstetric complications is less clear, despite it sharing pathophysiological pathways with several obstetric complications. This study aimed to further elucidate the relationship between endometriosis and key obstetric complications including miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, placenta previa, placenta abruption and small for gestational age (SGA) infants. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, where EMBASE, Medline and CINAHL were searched for all studies published before 9th October 2023, limited by the English language. 61 cohort and case-control studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. A meta-analysis was performed where the data allowed, and risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results: Women with endometriosis had a higher risk of preterm birth (OR 2.02; 95% CI, 1.54–2.65), pre-eclampsia (OR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.20–2.40), placenta previa (OR 3.18; 95% CI, 2.66–3.81), placenta abruption (OR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41–4.19), and SGA infants (OR 1.61; 95% CI, 1.16–2.25). No difference in the incidence of miscarriage (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 0.86–4.42) was found. Heterogeneity between studies was high for all outcomes except pre-eclampsia but a low risk of bias was seen. Conclusion: Endometriosis is associated with increased risk of key pregnancy complications. These women should therefore be streamed for high-risk care in pregnancy. Future work should focus on standardised methodology for associative cohort studies to reduce study heterogeneity. 59 A rare case of toxic megacolon, subtotal-colectomy and formation of end ileostomy with mucus fistula in a 15-year-old primiparous women post caesarean section Shayda Yazdani1; Fariha Rahim1; Frances Ibison2; Charlotte Cox1; Paul Barrow3; Alice Schofield4; Sara El Falaha1 1Department of Obstetrics, Sharoe Green Unit, Women's Division, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Fulwood, Preston, United Kingdom; 2Department of Histopathology, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Fulwood, Preston, United Kingdom; 3Department of Colorectal Surgery, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Fulwood, Preston, United Kingdom; 4Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Sharoe Green Unit, Women's Division, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Fulwood, Preston, United Kingdom Background: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacillus, associated with severe diarrhoea and colonic inflammation. Toxic megacolon is a rare but reported presentation of pseudomembranous colitis. Pregnant women have a unique immune state, and often have more severe presentation of CDI. Case: We present a case of 15-year-old woman, G1P0, concealed pregnancy, late-booker (29-weeks). Confirmed Escherichia-coli urinary-tract-infection, treated with Trimethoprim (30-weeks). At induction (40-weeks), Maternal Early Warning Score totalled five (Bp 121/65 mmHg, heart-rate 118 bpm, temperature 38.4°C, respiratory-rate 20/min, saturations 98%). Maternal sepsis was diagnosed, pathological Cardiotocography recorded, and category two caesarean section performed. Post-operatively, persistent elevated temperature, 38.4°C, lower abdominal pain and loose stools were observed. Senior review suspected CDI, oral Vancomycin commenced. Day three post-operative Computerised-Tomography abdomen and pelvis demonstrated; pan-colonic mural thickening, dilation of the ascending colon. Differentials included pseudo-obstruction / infective colitis. Intravenous Tazocin, Cefuroxime, Rifampicin and Gentamicin were commenced. Urgent surgical review was conducted. Managed with an emergency laparotomy, subtotal-colectomy and formation of end ileostomy with mucus fistula. Unplanned admission to intensive care was required. In total 5.5 cm of terminal-ileum and 73 cm of colon were resected. Histopathology revealed acute inflammation of colon in keeping with pseudomembranous colitis. Conclusion: Antibiotics can disrupt normal gut bacteria, allowing growth of CDI. These effects may last from weeks to months. A low threshold for suspecting CDI peri-partum is crucial. Caesarean section remains a major abdominal surgery. Peri-operative complications can be life threatening with significant morbidity. Senior review, enhanced imaging and multidisciplinary involvement is key for optimal management. 61 Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in women with PCOS: A cohort study of 75142 participants from the UK biobank Triada (Iriana) Doulgeraki1; Eleanor Barry1; Annie Wright2; Ho Frederick3; Carlos Celis-Morales4; Jill Pell3; Naveed Sattar4; Stamatina Iliodromiti1 1Women's Health Research Unit, Wolfson Institute of Population Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom; 2School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; 3School of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; 4School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors, however, it remains unclear whether it is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods: We conducted a cohort study on 75,142 women of reproductive age without cardiovascular disease when recruited to UK Biobank, of whom 15,747 had PCOS. The primary outcome was fatal and non-fatal events for ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease. We constructed Cox regression analysis adjusted for confounders to estimate the magnitude of association between PCOS and incident events (fatal or non-fatal) for ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease. Results: Women were followed up for a mean of 11.1 years. The incidence rate of ischemic heart and cerebrovascular events was 1.92/1,000 person years in the PCOS population and 1.90/1,000 person years in women without PCOS. PCOS was associated with a higher risk of obesity (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.80–1.96), hypertension (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.1.33–1.44) and type 2 diabetes (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.75–2.11). In the adjusted Cox regression model, PCOS was not associated with increased risk of incident events (fatal or non-fatal) for ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79–1.02). Conclusion: Although PCOS is strongly associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, this did not translate into higher risk of ischemic heart and cerebrovascular events. Further research is warranted to determine whether this is true across different subtypes of PCOS or in menopausal women with a history of PCOS. 83 Introduction of a multi-professional maternal medicine and human factors-based simulation Danielle Davies; Sarah Woods; Alex Rutherford; Alexandra Van Der Meer Great Western Hospital, Swindon, United Kingdom Introduction: Human factors are increasingly recognised as important in healthcare training. Simulation participants report improvements in clinical and human factors skills during emergencies. MBBRACE continues to find cardiac disease the largest cause of indirect maternal deaths (excluding COVID-19). With more complex maternity patients, education on cardiology complications and collaboration between unfamiliar teams is necessary to manage patients who may quickly deteriorate. Methods: We introduced multi-professional simulation-based training over 3 years at Great Western Hospital, Swindon. Initially aimed at improving training for medical registrars, this evolved to include obstetricians and anaesthetists in training, alongside experienced midwives. Simulation scenarios included palpitations (SVT), shortness of breath (peripartum cardiomyopathy), chest pain (aortic dissection) and headache/seizure (intracranial haemorrhage). Sessions were held within the simulation suite, with real-time monitors of observations and staff acting as patients to increase fidelity. Senior obstetricians and medical doctors ran the debrief to discuss key learning points. Results: This year we have already held 3 sessions (each with 4 scenarios), a total of 15 doctors participating. 100% of the participants scored sessions 5/5 overall. Qualitative feedback focused on how valuable it was to have all members of the MDT participating. In addition, participants felt the complexity of medical scenarios allowed truly realistic and challenging human factors situations to arise. The learning environment and debrief were highlighted as constructive. Participants felt more sessions and widening participation would be beneficial. Conclusion: Our MDT simulations received overwhelmingly positive feedback from staff within three specialities and helped O&G doctors complete e-portfolio CiP5. 97 Superior hypogastric plexus block in laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy: An audit of patient outcomes at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust Hannah Bhopal1; Amy Tuddenham1; Onyebuchi Udegbunam2; Ahmed Etman2 1Northern Deanery, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom; 2Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Northumbria, United Kingdom Introduction: We looked at the impact of Superior Hypogastric Plexus (SHP) Block on post operative pain and discharge timing following Laparoscopic & Robotic Hysterectomy. Methods: This was a retrospective audit of 149 patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy. We compared outcomes of patients who received an SHP block with those who did not. We used electronic case notes to collect data for the following outcomes: post-operative analgesia, post
