Abstract High-purity ethylene production from CO 2 electroreduction (CO 2 RR) is a coveted, yet arduous feat because the product stream comprises a blend of unreacted CO 2 , H 2, and other off-target CO 2 reduction products. Here we present an indirect reduction strategy for CO 2 -to-ethylene conversion, one that employs 2-bromoethanol (Br-EO) as a mediator. Br-EO is initially generated from CO 2 RR and subsequently undergoes reduction to ethylene without the need for energy-intensive separation steps. The optimized AC-Ag/C catalyst with Cl incorporation reduces the energy barrier of the debromination step during Br-EO reduction, and accelerates the mass-transfer process, delivering a 4-fold decrease of the relaxation time constant. Resultantly, AC-Ag/C achieved a FE ethylene of over 95.0 ± 0.36% at a low potential of −0.08 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an H-type cell with 0.5 M KCl electrolyte, alongside a near 100% selectivity within the range of −0.38 to −0.58 V versus RHE. Through this indirect strategy, the average ethylene purity within 6-hour electrolysis was 98.00 ± 1.45 wt%, at −0.48 V (vs RHE) from the neutralized electrolyte after CO 2 reduction over the Cu/Cu 2 O catalyst in a flow-cell.

<p>Exhaustion of fossil fuel resources, inconsistent fuel costs and the difficulty of adopting electric vehicle technology in commercial vehicles support the idea that there is an opportunity for research in public transit regarding the correlation between energy efficiency and aerodynamic drag. The turbulent external airflow over a bus at high speeds impacts acceleration, speed, and fuel economy. The fundamental bus's design is intended to carry enough passengers for a reasonable run. Envisaging the factors influencing aerodynamic drag is defiant due to the convoluted relationship between the moving bus and the air. Consequently, a comprehensive numerical and experimental exploration is executed on the bodywork of a bus to improve its aerodynamic efficiency. The aerodynamic drag is directly proportional to the variations in the air density, frontal area, freestream velocity and the drag coefficient. Minimal design reforms are performed on a distinctive long-haul bus. The exertion aims to minimize the drag coefficient, thereby improving the flow characteristics of the bus's bodywork. Through the shape optimization of the bus's bodywork, the modified design has attained a forty-five percent reduction in the drag coefficient. This substantial reduction in drag coefficient directly impacts the reduction of drag force, energy efficiency improvement, and carbon emissions reduction.</p>

Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to value‐added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen‐coordinated Fe‐N5 sites on ultrathin defect‐rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect‐rich in nitrogen‐doped carbon (FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99% for CO production (‐0.4 V vs. RHE) in an H‐cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98% at a current density of 270 mA cm‐2 (‐1.0 V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn‐CO2 battery with a cycle durability of 24 hours. In‐situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.

Although CO2 contributes to global warming, it also offers potential as a raw material for the production of hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H4 and CH3OH). Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is an emerging technology that utilizes renewable energy to convert CO2 into valuable fuels, solving environmental and energy problems simultaneously. Insights gained at any individual scale can only provide a limited view of that specific scale. Multiscale modeling, which involves coupling atomistic‐level insights (DFT) and (MD), with mesoscale (KMC and MK) and macroscale (CFD) simulations, has received significant attention recently. While multiscale modeling of eCO2RR on electrocatalysts across all scales is limited due to its complexity, this review offers an overview of recent works on single scales and the coupling of two and three scales, such as "DFT+MD", "DFT+KMC", "DFT+MK", "KMC/MK+CFD" and "DFT+MK/KMC+CFD", focusing particularly on Cu‐based electrocatalysts. This sets it apart from other reviews that solely focus exclusively on a single scale or only on a combination of DFT and MK/KMC scales. Furthermore, this review offers a concise overview of machine learning (ML) applications for eCO2RR, an emerging approach that has not yet been reviewed. Finally, this review highlights the key challenges, research gaps and perspectives of multiscale modeling for eCO2RR.    

    

## A First-Principles Study on the Reaction Mechanisms of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C1 and C2 Products on Cu(110)

The mechanism of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction on a Cu(110) surface has yet to be fully revealed. In this work, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the mechanisms of the CO2 reduction reaction to produce C1 (including one C atom) and C2 (including two C atoms) products on a Cu(110) surface. The results show that CH4 and C2H5OH are the main C1 and C2 products on the Cu(110) surface, respectively. CH4 is produced along the pathway CO2 → COOH* → CO* → CHO* → CH2O* → CH3O* → CH4. C2H5OH is produced via the C-C coupling pathway between CO* and CH2O* intermediates, which is the key reaction step. This is because CO* and CH2O* coupling to CO-CH2O* has the lowest barrier among the CHxO* (x = 0–2) coupling pathways. Therefore, it is the most likely C-C coupling pathway. Further, CO-CH2O* is gradually hydrogenated to C2H5OH along the following pathway: CO-CH2O* → CHO-CH2O* → CHOH-CH2* → CH2OH-CH2* → CH2OH-CH3* → C2H5OH.

Abstract To boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), a unique synthetic method that deploys the in situ reduction of precoated precursors was developed to produce activated Ag nanoparticles (NPs) within the gas diffusion layer (GDL), where the thus-obtained Ag NPs-Skeleton could block direct contact between the active Ag sites and electrolyte. Specifically, compared to the conventional surface loading mode in the acidic media, our freestanding and binder free electrode could achieve obvious higher CO selectivity of 94%, CO production rate of 23.3 mol g-1 h-1, single-pass CO2 conversion of 58.6%, and enhanced long-term stability of 8 hours. Our study shows that delivering catalysts within the GDL does not only gain the desired physical protection from GDL skeleton to achieve a superior local microenvironment for more efficient pH-universal eCO2RR, but also manifests the pore structures to effectively address gas accumulation and flood issues, thereby stabilizing the catalysts.

Due to climate change risks, the public, regulators, and investors require solid actions to minimize the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of mineral extraction and metals production. The mining sector considers alternatives to reduce its carbon footprint by transforming the business and adopting new technologies into operations. Given the capital intensity, technical characteristics, and business structure involved, a shift in the mining industry necessitates impartial insights into the trade-offs and risks. Considering the low-carbon transition trade-offs and risks in mining, this study presents the application of system dynamics modeling (SDM) in mining projects to analyze the impact of decarbonization alternatives with respect to carbon footprint and costs. A system dynamics model of an open-pit copper mine is developed to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as capital and operational costs, during the project life cycle. The change in GHG emissions in the business-as-usual scenario with diesel equipment haulage versus the alternative scenario with electric overland conveyor haulage is compared concerning GHG emissions and associated costs. The results unequivocally demonstrated that electrifying material mobility offers significant decarbonization in open-pit mining if the on-site electricity has a low emission factor. The findings also indicate that the substantial cost difference between electrification and diesel alternatives is another major obstacle to implementing electrification in an open-pit copper mine. This research proves that implementing SDM in the mining industry can offer impartial insights into decision-making and enable a thorough evaluation of options using quantitative criteria. It effectively assesses and communicates the trade-offs and risks of transitioning to low-carbon alternatives because it analyzes project variables quantitatively and holistically and is easy to run.

As prominent oil producers, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have played a significant role in the global energy market. However, as the world’s attention increasingly shifts towards environmental sustainability, understanding the implications of the GCC’s economic activities on CO2 emissions becomes indispensable. This research paper investigates the relationship between specific economic indicators and their impact on CO2 emissions in the GCC from 2001 to 2021. This study employs quantile regression, a robust statistical method that estimates the conditional quantiles of a response variable given a set of predictor variables. The findings reveal several essential insights: Financial institution efficiency is significant and negative at a 1% level at the lower (10th, −83,537.3) and higher quantiles (90th, −549,002.3). The relationship between the GDP per capita and CO2 emissions varies across quantiles, highlighting the complexity of the growth–environment nexus. Total patents exhibit a positive and significant relationship with emissions, underscoring the importance of directing innovation towards environmentally sustainable solutions. Renewable energy consumption displays a nuanced relationship with CO2 emissions, with a more substantial negative impact observed at higher consumption levels. This underscores the potential of renewable energy to mitigate emissions when integrated at scale. This study’s outcomes hold crucial policy implications for GCC countries as they seek to align economic growth with environmental sustainability. The findings emphasize the importance of fostering financial institution efficiency, promoting green innovation, and expanding renewable energy sources to reduce emissions.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2RR) holds promise in mitigating atmospheric greenhouse gas levels but is hindered by low reaction kinetics, high energy barriers, and poor selectivity. To address these challenges, we developed a novel series of cost‐effective AgCu‐containing metal‐aerogel catalysts with high electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) using a top‐down reduction approach. The Ag85Cu15 aerogel, with an ECSA of 27.41 cm², achieved a Faraday efficiency (FE%) of 89.3% for CO production at ‐0.9 V vs. RHE. Increasing the Cu content to over 50% in the aerogel matrix produced small amounts of C2H4, with a maximum FE% of 12.9% at ‐1.0 V vs. RHE. To further enhance CO2 reduction efficiency, multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were incorporated into the Ag85Cu15 alloy aerogel via a hydrothermal treatment. The highly dispersed CNTs within the aerogel matrix increased the ECSA to 57.00 cm² by forming a well‐defined porous structure through van‐der Waals interactions, improving CO selectivity, and achieving a FE% of 98.6% at ‐0.7 V vs. RHE and a partial current density of 9.6 mA/cm² in an H‐cell. 86% of the initial FECO% was maintained during an 18 h test with continuous electrolysis.

The practice of capturing, storing and utilizing CO2 is becoming key to developing sustainable energy and industrial solutions. The technology promotes the use of fossil fuels, which remain the predominant source of energy worldwide. The effectiveness of the technology is evident in the reduction of CO2 levels in the atmosphere, a significant contribution to the reduction of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the fight against climate change. However, a notable concern in the realm of geological storage revolves around the potential leakage of CO2 from storage reservoirs. Carbon dioxide has the capability to migrate from the storage site, reaching both the surface and underground formations. Surface leakage presents health risks to humans, animals, and plants. The solution to this problem requires a detailed approach and should be solved through an inverse problem, in which pressure measurements in monitoring wells will be performed frequently to obtain information about the reservoir and possible leaks. Additionally, there are a number of issues with carbon dioxide leakage during oil and gas extraction, as well as various operations at fields. Emphasizing the monitoring of CO2 leakage, this paper underscores the importance of developing an algorithm designed to proactively prevent CO2 leakage in aquifers and depleted reservoirs. Such an initiative is pivotal in the broader context of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The paper offers an overview of methodologies for effective monitoring, management and modeling of CO2 leakage and practical approaches to calculation and assessment, contributing to a more complete understanding of the challenges associated with CO2 storage.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas, and its resource use is vital for carbon reduction and neutrality. Herein, the nucleophilic addition reaction of calcium carbide (CaC2) to CO2 was studied for the first time to synthesize propiolic and butynedioic acids by using CuI or AgNO3 as catalyst, Na2CO3 as additive, and triphenylphosphine as ligand in the presence/absence of a hydrogen donor. The effects of the experimental conditions and intensification approach on the reaction were investigated. The reactivity of CaC2 is closely associated with its synergistic activation by the catalysts, solvent, and external intensification, such as the ultrasound and mechanical force. Ultrasound helps to promote the reaction by enhancing the interfacial mass transfer of CaC2 particulates. Mechanochemistry can effectively promote the reaction, yielding 29.8% of butynedioic acid and 74.8% of propiolic acid after 2 h ball milling at 150 rpm, arising from the effective micronization and interfacial renewal of calcium carbide. The present study sheds a light on the high-value uses of CO2 and CaC2 and is of reference significance for the nucleophilic reaction of CaC2 with other carbonyl compounds.

Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction has emerged as a paramount priority, aiming to achieve ‘peak emissions and carbon neutrality’, wherein green innovation assumes a critical role. The existing literature has extensively examined the impact of green innovations on carbon emissions. However, there has been comparatively less emphasis on the nonlinear relationship between technological innovations and carbon emission. This research employs the panel data from 16 districts in Shanghai spanning from 2010 to 2019 to investigate the nonlinear relationship between technological innovation and carbon emissions. The primary objective of our research is to examine the applicability of the maximum information coefficient method within an environmental context. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that patent applications, patent citations, and patent grants exhibit feature importance scores of 0.55, 0.53, and 0.52, respectively, according to the random forest regression results. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers committed to achieving carbon neutrality of China.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) offers a promising approach to address the dual challenges of energy scarcity and environmental degradation. This study presents a new, cost-effective, and scalable electrocatalyst: self-supporting carbon paper modified with porous conjugated polyimides. This innovative material facilitates efficient CO2 conversion in aqueous media, eliminating the need for a pyrolysis step. The electrocatalyst’s design utilizes a non-metallic organic polymer with a high density of nitrogen atoms, serving as active sites for catalysis. Its unique mesoporous microsphere structure comprises randomly stacked nanosheets that are generated in situ and aligned along the carbon fibers of carbon paper substrate. This architecture enhances both CO2 adsorption and ensures proper electron transportation, facilitated by the conjugated structure of the polymer. Additionally, the inherent hydrophobicity of conjugated polyimides contributes to its robust catalytic performance in selectively reducing CO2, yielding CO as the primary gaseous product with up to 88.7% Faradaic efficiency and 82.0 mmol g-1 h-1 yield rate. Therefore, the proposed electrocatalyst provides a sustainable solution for electrochemical CO2RR catalyzed by non-metal organic materials, combining high efficiency with the advantages of a simple preparation process and the absence of costly materials or steps. This research contributes to the advancement of CO2RR technologies, potentially leading to more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient solutions.

Agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Biochar has been recommended as a potential strategy to mitigate GHG emissions and improve soil fertility and crop productivity. However, few studies have investigated the potential of biochar co-compost (BCC) in relation to soil properties, rice productivity, and GHG emissions. Therefore, we examined the potential of BC, compost (CP), and BCC in terms of environmental and agronomic benefits. The study comprised four different treatments: control, biochar, compost, and biochar co-compost. The application of all of the treatments increased the soil pH; however, BC and BCC remained the top performers. The addition of BC and BBC also limited the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) availability and increased soil organic carbon (SOC), which limited the GHG emissions. Biochar co-compost resulted in fewer carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, while BC resulted in fewer methane (CH4) emissions, which was comparable with BCC. Moreover, BC caused a marked reduction in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions that was comparable to BCC. This reduction was attributed to increased soil pH, nosZ, and nirK abundance and a reduction in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) abundance. The application of different amendments, particularly BCC, favored rice growth and productivity by increasing nutrient availability, soil carbon, and enzymatic activities. Lastly, BCC and BC also increased the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria, which favored plant growth and caused a reduction in GHG emissions. Our results suggest that BCC could be an important practice to recycle organic sources while optimizing climate change and crop productivity.

The Lunnan oilfield, nestled within the Tarim Basin, represents a prototypical extra-low-permeability sandstone reservoir, distinguished by high-quality crude oil characterised by a low viscosity, density, and gel content. The effective exploitation of such reservoirs hinges on the implementation of carbon dioxide (CO2) flooding techniques. This study, focusing on the sandstone reservoirs of Lunnan, delves into the mechanisms of CO2-assisted oil displacement under diverse operational parameters: injection pressures, CO2 concentration levels, and variations in crude oil properties. It integrates analyses on the high-pressure, high-temperature behaviour of CO2, the dynamics of CO2 injection and expansion, prolonged core flood characteristics, and the governing principles of minimum miscible pressure transitions. The findings reveal a nuanced interplay between variables: CO2’s density and viscosity initially surge with escalating injection pressures before stabilising, whereas they experience a gradual decline with increasing temperature. Enhanced CO2 injection correlates with a heightened expansion coefficient, yet the density increment of degassed crude oil remains marginal. Notably, CO2 viscosity undergoes a substantial reduction under stratigraphic pressures. The sequential application of water alternating gas (WAG) followed by continuous CO2 flooding attains oil recovery efficiency surpassing 90%, emphasising the superiority of uninterrupted CO2 injection over processes lacking profiling. The presence of non-miscible hydrocarbon gases in segmented plug drives impedes the oil displacement efficiency, underscoring the importance of CO2 purity in the displacement medium. Furthermore, a marked trend emerges in crude oil recovery rates as the replacement pressure escalates, exhibiting an initial rapid enhancement succeeded by a gradual rise. Collectively, these insights offer a robust theoretical foundation endorsing the deployment of CO2 flooding strategies for enhancing oil recovery from sandstone reservoirs, thereby contributing valuable data to the advancement of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies in challenging, low-permeability environments.

Abstract Both the global and the German climate targets are ambitious given recent emission reduction rates. In addition to emission reduction measures, carbon dioxide removal has been increasingly discussed recently and initial measures have been developed to potentially scale-up carbon removals in order to meet net zero targets. In this article, we undertake a political economy-based analysis of the historical development and structural conditions of German climate policy measures and their enabling role for the emergence and strengthening of carbon dioxide removal policy options. We refer to regulation theory and the Modell Deutschland approach and argue that within this model the concept of ecological modernization has been established as the dominant approach to regulate society-nature relations. In light of the ambitious climate policy goals, such as net zero by 2045, ecological modernization reaches its current limits and must be recalibrated. Against this background, we conclude by discussing the risk of mitigation deterrence associated with carbon dioxide removals and considering alternative pathways, such as degrowth, to social ecological transformation.

With the rapid development of the digital economy, its environmental impact, particularly on carbon dioxide emissions in resource-based cities, has emerged as a vital research topic. Resource-based cities, often central to traditional industries, are confronted with the dual challenges of environmental pollution and economic transformation. This study employs empirical analysis to examine the influence of the digital economy on carbon dioxide emissions in these cities. The findings reveal that the digital economy significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions, with this impact being more pronounced in the early stages of digital economic development and gradually diminishing thereafter. In the mechanism analysis, we found that the digital economy can reduce carbon dioxide emissions in resource-based cities by raising public concern about the environment. Moreover, the study highlights significant variations in carbon reduction effects among different types of resource-based cities, noting that stronger environmental regulations further enhance these effects. These insights not only provide a new theoretical perspective but also offer practical guidance for policymakers in promoting sustainable development within the digital economy.

This constitutes the second segment of an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) study on oilseed rape cultivation in the prevalent conditions of Vojvodina, Serbia. The paper presents the results of the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phase of the LCA. The functional unit (FU) is one hectare of agricultural land used for winter rapeseed cultivation, with a reference flow of 3,000 kg of seeds, representing the average yield per hectare. The assessment is focused on the rapeseed production chain, concluding with the transportation of oilseeds to regional silos. The environmental impact assessment employed the ReCiPe 2016 (H) LCIA method, using the OpenLCA software. The study found that the total damage to human health was estimated at 0.0048 DALY, while damage due to biodiversity loss was calculated as 0.0001 species per year. Additionally, the damage resulting from the exploitation of geological mineral reserves was determined to be 167 USD per FU. Notably, land occupation was identified as the primary contributor to biodiversity loss, accounting for 90% of the associated damage within the rapeseed production chain. Meanwhile, the life cycle of diesel fuel, the mineral fertilizer production chain, and nitrogen compound emissions from agricultural land collectively accounted for 74% of the damage to human health and 91% of the damage attributed to mineral resource consumption. On the midpoint level, the ReCiPe 2016 (H) LCIA method calculates results within 18 impact categories, including the impact on global warming and fossil fuel depletion. The cumulative impact of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted in the rapeseed production chain is equivalent to the impact of 1,970 kg of carbon dioxide. The carbon footprint of rapeseed was estimated at 0.65 kg CO2 eq. per kg of rapeseed. In the production chain of 3,000 kg of rapeseed, 454 kg of oil equivalent is consumed, which means that approximately 6.93 MJ of energy from fossil sources is required to produce 1 kg of rapeseed under the prevalent conditions in Vojvodina. The ReCiPe 2016 method identified and assessed the impact of approximately 750 different emissions with adverse effects on the environment, as well as the impact of around 250 different forms of natural resources consumed or used in the rapeseed production chain. However, the results of the LCIA analysis show that only about ten elementary flows are responsible for over 90% of the total damage in specific protection areas. These primarily include air emissions (carbon dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide, and suspended particles), emissions of certain heavy metals into water and soil (hexavalent chromium and zinc), as well as the exploitation of some natural resources, notably arable land, natural gas, and crude oil. The results of the LCIA analysis can be utilized to identify processes and emissions where rationalization or improved control can yield the greatest environmental benefits. The most substantial environmental improvements are expected through the reduction of mineral fertilizer consumption per unit yield and the decrease in diesel fuel usage for field and transportation activities. Furthermore, enhanced control over emissions that contribute significantly to the adverse impacts of the rapeseed production chain can also lead to substantial environmental enhancements.

Abstract Over the past decade, 1000s of cities have pledged reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. However, tracking progress toward these pledges has largely relied exclusively on activity-based, self-reported emissions inventories, which often underestimate emissions due to incomplete accounting. Furthermore, the lack of a consistent framework that may be deployed broadly, across political boundaries, hampers understanding of changes in both city-scale emissions and the global summation of urban emissions mitigation actions, with insight being particularly limited for cities within the global south. Given the pressing need for rapid decarbonization, development of a consistent framework that tracks progress toward city-scale emissions reduction targets, while providing actionable information for policy makers, will be critical. Here, we combine satellite-based observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and an atmospheric model to present an atmospherically-based framework for monitoring changes in urban emissions and related intensity metrics. Application of this framework to 77 cities captures ∼16% of global carbon dioxide emissions, similar in magnitude to the total direct emissions of the United States or Europe, and demonstrates the framework’s ability to track changes in emissions via satellite-observation. COVID-19 lockdowns correspond to an average ∼21% reduction in emissions across urban systems over March–May of 2020 relative to non-lockdown years. Urban scaling analyses suggest that per capita energy savings drive decreases in emissions per capita as population density increases, while local affluence and economic development correspond to increasing emissions. Results highlight the potential for a global atmospherically-based monitoring framework to complement activity-based inventories and provide actionable information regarding interactions between city-scale emissions and local policy actions.

Monometallic and bimetallic Cu:Ni catalysts with different Cu:Ni molar ratios (3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3) were synthesized by wetness impregnation on activated carbon and characterized by TPR (temperature programmed reduction), XRD (X-ray diffraction) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). The synthesized catalysts were evaluated in the gas phase production of diethyl carbonate from ethanol and carbon dioxide. The largest catalytic activity was obtained over the bimetallic catalyst with a Cu:Ni molar ratio of 3:1. Its improved activity was attributed to the formation of a Cu-Ni alloy on the surface of the catalyst, evidenced by XPS and in agreement with a previous assignment based on Vegard law and TPR analysis. During the reaction rate experiments, it observed the presence of a maximum of the reaction rate as a function of temperature, a tendency also reported for other carbon dioxide-alcohol reactions. It showed that the reaction rate-temperature data can be adjusted with a reversible rate equation. The initial rate as a function of reactant partial pressure data was satisfactorily adjusted using the forward power law rate equation and it was found that the reaction rate is first order in CO

This review addresses the energy efficient technology and carbon trading for reducing carbon emissions. Energy-efficient technologies (EET) and carbon trading are mechanisms for mitigating climate change. EET offers direct ways to reduce emissions by improving the efficiency of energy use in various sectors. The use of technologies such as Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) in compressors, enhanced thermal performance in buildings, and smart lighting systems demonstrate significant potential in cutting energy consumption and thereby emissions The roles of carbon credits in international emission trading schemes, emphasizing their dual purpose of environmental protection and revenue generation for developing nations. The study explores into various types of carbon credit projects, including the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), highlighting their distribution and impact across different regions. The importance of forests in carbon dioxide absorption and the challenges of ensuring permanence and accounting for carbon sequestration are also discussed. Additionally, the document examines policy recommendations, such as carbon pricing and emission reduction targets set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Abstract Net-zero commitments have become the central focal point for countries to communicate long-term climate targets. However, to this point it is not clear to what extent conventional emissions reductions and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will contribute to net-zero. An integrated market for emissions and removals with a uniform carbon price delivers the economically efficient contribution of CDR to net-zero, yet it might not fully internalise sustainability risks of CDR and hence could lead to its overuse. In this study, we explore the implications of separating targets for emission reductions and CDR for global net-zero emissions pathways with the Integrated Assessment Model REMIND. Even though it entails a deviation from the solution of the integrated market, we find that efficiency losses are moderate. Limiting CDR lowers the financial burden for public finance, limits reliance on geologic CO2 storage and leads to lower cumulative emissions, yet this increase in ambition comes at higher total mitigation costs.

Abstract Modifying the chemical environment of active surfaces with ionic liquids (IL) is an emerging strategy for tailoring novel electrocatalytic systems, including carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR). Although copper (Cu) catalysts have recently gained more attention in this field, their modification with ILs is yet to be investigated. This work tested a range of common hydrophobic ILs impregnated into carbon‐supported Cu catalysts, following the “solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer” (SCILL) approach. The latter was used to showcase the applicability of real‐time product detection for CO 2 RR employing electrochemical mass spectrometry. The observed patterns of C 1 to C 3 product selectivity offered valuable insights into the intricate reaction mechanism. In addition, increasing the size of the IL cation showed an opposite and significant effect on the reaction selectivity. The obtained qualitative results were partially compared with conventional long‐term experiments.

<p>The hunt for alternative fuels that may be utilized in place of conventional fuels is intensifying quickly since the availability of fossil fuels is dwindling daily. In this work, biodiesel derived from pumpkin and cotton seed oils is presented for use as diesel engine fuel. Related to diesel, the calorific value of this precise biodiesel is low. In a 4-stroke diesel engine, four mixes (B0, B25, B50, B75 and B100) of biodiesel were evaluated. The engine's emissions and combustion results were contrasted with the diesels. When all blended fuels are related to diesel fuel, the test repercussions illustrate a small increase in the thermal efficiency of the brakes and a decrease in the consumption of fuel specifically for the brake. Emissions of Carbon monoxide and the usage of biodiesel subsequent in a reduction in hydrocarbon emissions and an upsurge in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. The experiment's results showed that biodiesel, which is derived from these seed oils, maybe a useful diesel replacement for compression ignition engines.</p>

Making a measurement over millions of nanoparticles or exposed crystal facets seldom reports on reactivity of a single nanoparticle or facet, which may depart drastically from ensemble measurements. Within the past 30 years, science has moved toward studying the reactivity of single atoms, molecules, and nanoparticles, one at a time. This shift has been fueled by the realization that everything changes at the nanoscale, especially important industrially relevant properties like those important to electrocatalysis. Studying single nanoscale entities, however, is not trivial and has required the development of new measurement tools. This review explores a tale of the clever use of old and new measurement tools to study electrocatalysis at the single entity level. We explore in detail the complex interrelationship between measurement method, electrocatalytic material, and reaction of interest (e.g., carbon dioxide reduction, oxygen reduction, hydrazine oxidation, etc.). We end with our perspective on the future of single entity electrocatalysis with a key focus on what types of measurements present the greatest opportunity for fundamental discovery.

The direct conversion of CO2 in flue gas to value‐added chemicals is a potentially important cost‐effective solar‐driven CO2 reduction technology. The present work demonstrates the solar‐powered conversion of CO2 to CO with greater than 10% efficiency using a Mn complex cathode and an Fe‐Ni anode in a single‐compartment reactor without an ion exchange membrane in conjunction with a Si solar cell. Reactors separated by ion exchange membranes are typically used to prevent any effects of oxygen generated by the counter electrode. However, the present Mn complex catalyst maintained its activity even in the presence of 15% O2. Operando surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy established that the present Mn catalyst preferentially reacted with CO2 without adsorbing O2. This unique characteristic enabled solar‐driven CO2 reduction using a single‐compartment reactor. In contrast, catalytic metals such as Ag tend to lose activity in such systems as a consequence of reaction with oxygen produced at the anode.

Reducing the amount of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane released into the atmosphere is one of the causes of climate change, which is from actions such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and agricultural practices using renewable energy, such as solar energy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the model in depth of energy waqf (solar panel) on the issue of climate change. The data of this study was obtained through a literature study and evaluated in three steps: data reduction, data distribution, and conclusion drawn. The results of the study show that the waqf energy model (solar panel) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is because solar power plants built with waqf funds can produce safe electrical energy and do not emit greenhouse gases. Solar power plants built with waqf funds can be used to meet the needs of the community, such as households, SMEs, and industries. This can reduce people's dependence on fossil energy, which is an energy source that produces greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the energy waqf model (solar panels) can also generate economic and social benefits for the community.

Abstract Methane clumped isotope signatures of abiogenesis may be diagnostic of the origin of methane on Earth and other planetary bodies. We performed synthesis of abiogenic methane in hydrothermal conditions between 130 and 300°C and determined δ 13 C, δD, Δ 13 CH 3 D, and Δ 12 CH 2 D 2 . The experiments were performed by heating water in the presence of Fe 0 powder and CO. The reduction of water on metallic iron led to the formation of H 2 . CO was reacted with both H 2 and H 2 O, generating both CH 4 and CO 2 . Methane δ 13 C values are isotopically depleted by ∼25‰ relative to the CO starting material. This is consistent with carbon isotopic equilibrium between methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in our experiments. In contrast, D/H ratios are inconsistent with equilibrium isotopic fractionation, as illustrated by δD values of methane fractionated by ∼500‰ relative to starting H 2 O. This suggests that under our experimental conditions, hydrogen additions to carbon may be governed by kinetics. Δ 13 CH 3 D values track experimental temperature, with values between +1.5‰ and +5.0‰ for most samples. In contrast, Δ 12 CH 2 D 2 values are displaced from equilibrium. We find exclusively negative Δ 12 CH 2 D 2 values, showing deficits down to 40‰ relative to thermodynamic equilibrium. We interpret the data as evidence for distinct, kinetically induced D/H pools contributing to methane assembly, that is, a combinatorial effect. The cumulative D/H fractionations associated with CO hydrogenation explain the direction and magnitude of Δ 12 CH 2 D 2 values during abiotic methane formation. We suggest that near equilibrium Δ 13 CH 3 D with negative Δ 12 CH 2 D 2 signatures will help identify methane formed abiotically in nature.

Abstract Enhancing crop water use efficiency (WUE) is a key target trait for climatic resilience and expanding cultivation on marginal lands. Engineering lower stomatal density to reduce stomatal conductance (gs) has improved WUE in multiple C3 crop species. However, reducing gs in C3 species often reduces photosynthetic carbon gain. A different response is expected in C4 plants because they possess specialized anatomy and biochemistry which concentrates CO2 at the site of fixation. This modifies the photosynthesis (AN) relationship with intracellular CO2 concentration (ci) so that photosynthesis is CO2-saturated and reductions in gs are unlikely to limit AN. To test this hypothesis, genetic strategies were investigated to reduce stomatal density in the C4 crop sorghum. Constitutive expression of a synthetic epidermal patterning factor (EPF) transgenic allele in sorghum, led to reduced stomatal densities, reduced gs, reduced plant water use and avoidance of stress during a period of water deprivation. In addition, moderate reduction in stomatal density did not increase stomatal limitation to AN. However, these positive outcomes were associated with negative pleiotropic effects on reproductive development and photosynthetic capacity. Avoiding pleiotropy by targeting expression of the transgene to specific tissues could provide a pathway to improved agronomic outcomes.

In this paper, Au and Cu nanoparticles were successfully loaded onto porous g-C3N4 material through a hydrothermal synthesis method. By adjusting the proportion of Cu, Au-5%Cu/C3N4, Au-10%Cu/C3N4, and Au-15%Cu/C3N4, catalysts were prepared and used for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol. Characterization analysis using high-resolution XPS spectra showed that with an increase in the doping amount of Cu, the electron cloud density on the Cu surface initially increased and then decreased. Electrons from Au atoms transferred to Cu atoms, leading to the accumulation of a more negative charge on the Cu surface, promoting the adsorption of partially positively charged C in CO2, which is more beneficial for catalyzing CO2. Among them, Au-10%Cu/C3N4 exhibited good reducibility and strong basic sites, as demonstrated by H2-TPR and CO2-TPD, with the conversion rates for CO2, methanol yield, and methanol selectivity being 11.58%, 41.29 g·kg−1·h−1 (0.39 μmol·g−1s−1), and 59.77%, respectively.

The relationship between economic factors and environmental impacts is of paramount significance in the pursuit of sustainable development and the implementation of effective measures to alleviate environmental deterioration. This research utilizes the VECM, FMOLS, CCR, and DOLS methodologies to examine the relationship between income inequality and CO2 emissions spanning from 1990 to 2022 in Turkey. Theoretical frameworks such as Boyce's socio-economic dynamics, Veblen's pecuniary emulation theory, and the marginal propensity to emit provide detailed insights into the complex relationship between economic inequality and environmental degradation. In synthesizing the literature on income inequality and CO2 emissions, we observe a wide spectrum of findings ranging from positive to negative associations, with some studies yielding inconclusive results in different nations and areas. Beyond income inequality, this research considers a wider range of CO2 explanatory factors, such as GDP per capita, industrial value added, energy consumption, renewable energy, population density, and the Gini index. The estimates reveal that income per capita, industrial value added, energy consumption, and population density show positive linkages with CO2 emissions. On the other hand, renewable energy share and income inequality reflect negative associations with CO2 emissions. Notably, an increase in the Gini coefficient, reflecting worse income distribution, is associated with a reduction in CO2 emissions in Turkey.

Abstract The remaining carbon budget framework tracks progress towards the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit longer-term warming to well below 2 ºC, but no analogous framework exists for constraining mid-century warming. Established single-basket methods of combining gases into CO2-equivalents using Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) lead to ambiguity over what combination of short- and long-lived emissions reductions are needed because they obscure the distinct warming impacts of each. We investigate to what extent a multi-basket approach that separates short-lived and long-lived pollutants can better estimate the likelihood for emission pathways to meet a near-term warming goal. We develop logistic regression models to categorize IPCC emission pathways (AR6) based on whether they exceed a mid-century temperature threshold. We focus on two baskets, using CO2 for long-lived and methane (CH4) for short-lived gases. For comparison, we consider several single-basket approaches (e.g., GWP100, GWP20, GWP*). We further apply our framework to a synthetic dataset covering a broader emissions space. Across both datasets, the two-basket outperforms all single-baskets. Using an illustrative near-term goal (1.7ºC), the two-basket approach reduces the magnitude of overshoot by a factor of 7 compared with the traditional single-basket. The two-basket’s advantage is smaller with the AR6 pathways, which we attribute to the high correlation between CO2 and CH4 emissions and confounding effects from other pollutants. Our results indicate that the two-basket approach better constrains overshoot magnitude, particularly if future emissions deviate from the AR6 assumption of correlated CO2 and CH4 reductions. Our approach allows the determination of a metric value and reduction target in the context of a chosen set of scenarios and temperature threshold; the outcome is a near-term methane-specific emissions budget that can be adopted by decisionmakers in a way that is analogous and complementary to the carbon budget. Future work could consider a third basket for very short-lived pollutants.

As oil and gas companies are one of the major greenhouse gas emitters, they face increasing responsibility to address climate challenges. This highlights the necessity of integrating decarbonization options into their operations to meet global climate objectives. While progress in technologies for capturing, utilizing, and storing CO2 (CCUS technologies) is often attributed to oil and gas companies, CCUS projects in the sector predominantly focus on carbon storage, namely CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery, which presents limited possibilities. Meanwhile, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies offer a promising avenue for producing valuable products from CO2, a potential that has been underexplored in theory and practice within the oil and gas sector. This study analyzes the development of the full CCU cycle by oil and gas companies, assessing the economic viability of such projects. It includes a content analysis of research materials on CCU deployment and a case study modeling the economic viability of producing methanol from CO2 in Russia. The findings indicate that the estimated minimum price for CO2-based methanol to achieve project payback is USD 1128 per ton, compared to approximately USD 400 per ton for traditional methanol. This price gap underscores the need to foster the development of low-carbon technologies, markets, and measures to support these projects. In the domain of CCU projects, cost-reduction measures could be more applicable, while regulatory measures, such as carbon taxes, currently have a limited impact on the economic viability of these projects.

The article is devoted to the study of air pollution in the Burlin district of the West Kazakhstan region, where one of the main sources of air pollution is the Karachagan oil and gas condensate field, the main feature of which is the high content of hydrogen sulfide in natural gas from 4 to 4.3%. The analysis showed that the atmospheric air state in the specified area is determined by the characteristics of harmful emissions sources, composition, volumes of pollutant emissions and climatic characteristics of the territory, which determine the conditions for the polluting components dispersion. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the chemical composition of the atmospheric air in the study area, as well as the features of their changes over the years end climatic seasons, are largely determined by emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, volatile organic compounds and inorganic dust into the atmosphere by oil and gas facilities. The anthropogenic influence of industry in this area is also evidenced by the calculated value of the integral coefficient of air pollution. At the same time, industrial enterprises, having increased the anthropogenic impact on the environment, have the ability to prevent negative environmental consequences. The system of industrial environmental control of the chemical composition of industrial emissions at the Karachagnak field facilities is carried out on an ongoing basis. The analysis showed that a reduction in emissions and, accordingly, a reduction in ground-level concentrations of air pollutants at the Karachagnak field facilities is ensured by a whole range of technological and organizational measures, among which the technology of high-pressure gas reinjection deserves special attention. It necessitates the need to carry out systematic work to study the ecological state of the territory of the Karachagnak field, using not only ground-based research methods, but also modern geoinformation and aerospace technologies that make it possible to dynamically assess the changes taking place, conduct a geo-ecological assessment and make a forecast for the development of the environmental situation in this area. territories. The work carried out contributes to further analysis of the regional assessment of the environmental state of the atmosphere of large industrial centers.

Abstract Wetlands play an essential role in the global greenhouse gas budget via carbon dioxide sequestration as well as methane emission. In recent decades, solar‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been recognized as a remotely sensed proxy of gross primary productivity (GPP), which generates substrates for methane production. To examine the suitability of SIF for estimation of these two fluxes, we conducted ground tower‐based SIF observation with an ultrafine‐resolution spectroradiometer in conjunction with eddy covariance measurement in a cool‐temperate bog. The daily SIF retrieved in the red (687 nm) and far‐red (760 nm) bands (SIF red and SIF far‐red , respectively) increased nonlinearly with GPP and linearly with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). The relatively weak correlation between apparent SIF yield (ΦSIF = SIF/APAR) and light use efficiency implied that both APAR and plant physiology constrained the SIF emission in this wetland. The SIF red /SIF far‐red ratio showed a significant negative relationship with vegetation greenness indices, and the similar seasonal variation in SIF red and SIF far‐red indicated that the SIF red reabsorption effect only weakly influenced the SIF red –GPP relationship. Episodic temporal reduction in the water table did not distinctly influence SIF and ΦSIF. Estimation of the methane emission rate was subtly improved by incorporating SIF, which was substituted for GPP as the methanogenesis substrate, in a multivariable regression analysis together with two environmental factors: soil temperature and water table depth. This study illustrates the potential of both SIF red and SIF far‐red to monitor GPP and to predict methane emission in wetlands.

Rapid growth in vehicle ownership in the developing world and the evolution of transportation technologies have spurred a number of new challenges for policymakers. To address these challenges, this study develops a system dynamics (SD) model to project the future composition of Iran’s vehicle fleet, and to forecast fuel consumption and CO2 emissions through 2040. The model facilitates the exploration of system behaviors and the formulation of effective policies by equipping decision-makers with predictive insights. Under various scenarios, this study simulates the penetration of five distinct vehicle types, highlighting that an increase in fuel prices does not constitute a sustainable long-term intervention for reducing fuel consumption. Additionally, the model demonstrates that investments aimed at the rapid adoption of electric transportation technologies yield limited short-term reductions in CO2 emissions from transportation. The projections indicate that the number of vehicles in Iran is expected to surpass 30 million by 2040, with plug-in and hybrid electric vehicles (EVs and PHEVs) comprising up to approximately 2.2 million units in the base scenario. It is anticipated that annual gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions from passenger cars will escalate to 30,000 million liters and 77 million tons, respectively, over the next two decades. These findings highlight the need for a strategic approach in policy development to effectively manage the transition towards a lower-carbon vehicle fleet.

Lateritic ore carbothermalreduction is currently the focus of many researchers. This process uses a relatively lower temperature of operation than the smelting. Therefore, the carbothermal reduction process has a relatively lower primary energy demand and CO2 gas emissions. This research examines the appropriate briquette form to obtain the optimum recovery, concentration of nickel, and selective reduction of nickel, as well as analyzes the compounds/phases formed. The briquette in this study was formed into three different geometries, i.e., the pillow, spherical, and cylindrical forms. First, this research was carried out by mixing the raw materials and forming it into specified briquette forms. Second, the formed briquettes were put into a crucible. Third, the coal-limestone bed mixture was used to cover the briquettes. Then, the carbothermic reduction process was started by heating to 700 oC for 2 hours and continued to 1400 oC for 6 hours. Finally, the magnetic separation process was performed to separate the reduced briquettes. As a result, the cylindrical shape briquette obtained better results at 6.74% Ni, with a nickel recovery of 96.20% and a selectivity factor value of 10.39. The compounds formed after carbothermic reduction process products include FeNi, Fe3Si, and SiO2. In a spherical-shaped briquette, Fe3O4 and Mg2SiO4were found in the reduced product, indicating impurities in the reduced briquettes.

Owing to the tunable electronic properties, high carrier lifetimes, low recombination possibility, and long diffusion lengths, perovskites have gained attention for potential use in photoelectrocatalytic processes. Photoelectrochemical methods can convert sunlight into electricity or useful fuels, resulting in extensive research to develop PEC applications. This chapter embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the perovskite structure’s transformative influence on diverse photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) and monolithic Photovoltaic-Electrocatalytic (PV-EC) devices including water splitting, H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, degradation of pollutants, (bio) sensing, and organic synthesis. By assessing the mechanisms and kinetics involved, we aim to disclose the potential of perovskite-based photoelectrochemical systems in shaping the landscape of green energy and environmental stewardship. Furthermore, the chapter addresses the progress and challenges in enhancing the stability, selectivity, and efficiency of perovskite-based PEC and monolithic PV-EC reactions to unravel the synergistic potential for sustainable transformations in the realm of photoelectrochemistry.

Abstract: Palladium-catalyzed carbonylative cross-coupling reactions with various carbon monoxide (CO) sources cultivate competent routes for the synthesis of bulk and value-added chemicals. However, the practical use of this odorless, inflammable, lethal gas has always raised a concern for chemists. The attention and advancement of various CO-surrogates is surely wel-comed as a green alternative to CO-gas. However, the main concern lies in the suitability and scalability of these CO-surrogate-driven reactions. Literature showed the progress of various ways to make in-situ CO from these CO surrogates. One of the most convenient sources is using metal carbonyls which are already known to lose CO easily. Among all the kinds, Mo(CO)6 gained much popularity but its toxic nature and demand for high temperatures restricted its use. However, Co2(CO)8 is popular as a catalyst but as an in-situ CO-source reports are scarce. This low-melting CO-releaser was found effective in flourishing aminocarbonylation, alkoxycar-bonylation, and reductive carbonylation under mild conditions. This mini-review portrays the recent developments of palladium-catalyzed carbonylation reactions using Co2(CO)8 as a CO source.

Measuring the sticking coefficient of molecules pertinent to astrochemistry - such as CO - on substrates that mimic interstellar dust grains is crucial for the comprehensive understanding of gas-grain chemical processes. Although astrochemical models assume a sticking coefficient of 1, recent laboratory experiments on H2O and CO2 have revealed significantly lower values when measured on small grain analogs. As the effect of grain size on molecular adsorption has been largely ignored to date, further experiments are needed to determine the accretion rates of species known to freeze out on dust grains. Our aim is to determine the sticking coefficients of CO and N2 on sub-micrometric silicate and carbon grains. By quantifying realistic sticking coefficients on these dust grain analogs, we can improve the accuracy of astrochemists' predictions of molecular abundances as affected by gas-grain interactions. The molecules of interest were added to various substrates at 10 K in an ultra-high vacuum. The amount of adsorbate that stuck to the substrate was quantified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These quantities were compared to a reference with a sticking coefficient of 1, allowing the deduction of the sticking coefficient for each substrate. The average sticking coefficients of CO and N2 on grain analogs are 0.17 for CO and 0.14 for N2 on olivine powder, and 0.05 for CO and 0.07 on N2 on soot, instead of the presumed 1. This is in line with the low values previously reported for H2O and CO2 These laboratory results indicate that CO and N2 in addition to H2O and CO2 also exhibit a low sticking coefficient on dust grain analogs. It is thus necessary to reconsider the interactions between gaseous species and dust particles as a low-efficiency process. This reduction in accretion and reaction rates has important implications for how we understand astrochemistry.

Broiler farming is a significant source of gaseous emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different litter additives on the emission of NH3, N2O, CO2, and CH4 during broiler housing and subsequent manure storage. The gaseous emissions from the housing facilities were evaluated during one fattening cycle in environmentally controlled rooms with three different additives applied to the litter material (10% w/w aluminum sulphate or biochar and 2.50 mg m−2 urease inhibitor), as well as a control. A storage experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions for 90 days to evaluate the influence of these three additives on gaseous losses. During broiler housing, the results indicated that NH3 emissions were reduced significantly (40–60%) by litter additives, while global warming potential (GWP) emissions were reduced significantly (31%) by Alum. The addition of Biochar (a 58% reduction) had the same significant effect as Alum (a 60% reduction) to mitigate these losses. The re-application of Urease (a 41% reduction) may be required to reach an equal or higher reduction. During storage, NH3 and GWP emissions were not significantly affected by the litter additives. During broiler housing and subsequent manure storage, NH3 emissions were reduced significantly (22–41%) by litter additives, whereas GWP emissions did not decrease significantly. Globally, it can be concluded that Biochar appears to be a good alternative to Alum due to its equal effectiveness in mitigating NH3 losses, without increasing the GWP potential in the housing and avoiding pollution swapping.

Stomata regulate CO2 and water vapor exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Stomata are a target for engineering to improve crop intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE). One example is by expressing genes that lower stomatal density (SD) and reduce stomatal conductance (gsw). However, the quantitative relationship between reduced SD, gsw, and the mechanisms underlying it is poorly understood. We addressed this knowledge gap using low-SD sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) as a case study alongside a meta-analysis of data from 10 species. Transgenic expression of EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 from Sorghum bicolor (SbEFP2) in sugarcane reduced SD by 26-38% but did not affect gsw compared to wildtype. Further, no changes occurred in stomatal complex size or proxies for photosynthetic capacity. Measurements of gas exchange at low CO2 concentrations that promote complete stomatal opening to normalize aperture size between genotypes were combined with modeling of maximum gsw from anatomical data. These data suggest that increased stomatal aperture is the only possible explanation for maintaining gsw when SD is reduced. Meta-analysis across C3 dicots, C3 monocots, and C4 monocots revealed engineered reductions in SD are strongly correlated with lower gsw (r2=0.60-0.98), but this response is damped relative to the change in anatomy.

Building operations account for a large amount of energy use and CO2 emissions, and the morphology of buildings in residential clusters strongly impacts energy efficiency performance. However, little research has focused on the morphology and energy electricity usage of high-rise residential clusters in hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) regions. We investigated 96 residential clusters in Hangzhou, China, and established a corresponding morphology database. Additionally, we obtained annual electricity consumption for 16 of these residential clusters. With this database, we performed optimization of morphological parameters upon energy use intensity (EUI) using a genetic algorithm (GA). Specifically, the cooling, heating, and lighting EUIs of high-rise residential clusters were studied. After implementing the optimized morphological parameters, there was a reduction of up to 7.73% in EUI. According to regression analysis, the average aspect ratio was the most significant factor influencing EUI (r = −0.907), followed by floor area ratio (r = −0.755), average orientation (r = 0.502), and average number of floors (r = −0.453). These results indicate that a higher intensity of land development with a greater floor area ratio, average aspect ratio, and average number of floors can reduce total energy consumption. Additionally, we found that an average building orientation of southwest 15° (with respect to south) is optimal. The findings of this study can assist urban planners and designers in developing more sustainable residential clusters, leading to decreased energy costs and CO2 emissions.

Liquid fuel production from biomass-derived molecules has received great attention due to the diminished fossil fuel reserves, growing energy demand, and the necessity of CO2 emission reduction. The deoxygenation of oils and fatty acids is a promising process to obtain “green” diesel. Herein, we report the results of the study of the deoxygenation of stearic acid to alkanes as a model reaction. Series of Ni-supported on schungite were obtained by precipitation in subcritical water (hydrothermal deposition) and for comparison via wetness impregnation followed, in both cases, by calcination at 500 °C and a reduction in H2 at 300 °C. The catalyst obtained via hydrothermal synthesis showed a three-fold higher specific surface area with a four-fold higher active phase dispersion compared to the catalysts synthesized via conventional impregnation. The catalysts were tested in stearic acid deoxygenation in supercritical n-hexane as the solvent. Under optimized process conditions (temperature of 280 °C, hydrogen partial pressure of 1.5 MPa, and 13.2 mol of stearic acid per mol of Ni), a close to 100% yield of C10–C18 alkanes, containing over 70 wt.% of targeted n-heptadecane, was obtained after 60 min of reaction.

In recent years, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) have been gaining popularity as an alternative to conventional jet fuel due to their smaller carbon footprint. It has been estimated that their use will result in a 65% reduction in CO2 emissions. SAF can be produced by using waste oil, animal fat, plant-based oil or municipal waste. One promising feedstock for SAF production is alga as it grows quickly under the right conditions and may contain 50% oil. In this student project, algae species were reviewed, and one was chosen based on its growth speed and lipid-producing characteristics. A photobioreactor was designed and built. The algae grown were monitored and harvested. Due to the short duration of this project and difficulties in extracting the algae and a malfunctioning ultrasonic bath, the oil extracted was not sufficient for conversion into biodiesel. The heat of combustion of the produced fuel from used cooking oil was measured. The lessons learned are discussed. Key words. Photobioreactor, Biodiesel, Microalgae

Increased utilization of industrial surplus heat can make significant contributions towards reaching energy efficiency and emissions reduction goals. The off-gas from metal production smelters can contain large amounts of thermal energy, and conversion to electric power often appears an enticing prospect. However, the practical potential for exploitation can be significantly reduced from plant processes that are designed considering surplus heat as a waste product to get rid of. This typically makes the heat accessible only at reduced temperatures. The HighEFF research centre for industrial energy efficiency has studied technologies, applications, and cases for surplus heat utilization since its start in 2016. Heat-to-power conversion has been explored in several cases provided by the partner industries from – among others – Norwegian aluminium manufacturers. Centre research activities also include novel production processes and modifications, which has side effects providing very different conditions and constraints for energy recovery. One such process modification is off-gas recirculation, mainly developed to increase concentration of CO2 in the off-gas to improve conditions for CO2 capture in the future, but which also will alter off-gas temperature and recoverable heat as a side effect. This could improve the potential for energy recovery. In this work, the potential for energy recovery is evaluated and compared in four cases – one representing a current aluminium process, and three future process scenarios with flue gas recycling. The simulated heat-to-power conversion is done by applying an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) optimization model to each case. The results indicate significant benefits to energy recovery in the recycling cases. In the case with the highest recycling rate and flue gas temperature, the potential for electric power production increases by 270 % compared to the present-day case. In addition, the reduced work of the main exhaust fans in the recycling cases brings further energy savings on the system level equivalent to 25–50 % of the ORC power output, further increasing overall energy efficiency. From this, some potential synergies between process design, heat-to-power, and thermal integration of other technologies such as CO2-capture are discussed.

Synthetic biohybrid systems by coupling artificial system with nature’s machinery may offer a disruptive solution to address the global energy crisis. We developed a versatile electroenzymatic pathway for the continuous synthesis of valuable chemicals, facilitated by formate‐driven NADH regeneration. Utilising a bismuth electrocatalyst, we achieved stable CO2 reduction to formate with approximately 90% Faraday efficiency at a current density of 150 mA cm−2. The generated formate acts as a mediator to regenerate NADH, which is then coupled with immobilised redox enzymes—alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), L‐lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and L‐glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)—to produce targeted chemicals at significant rates and exceptionally high turnover numbers (1.8×106 to 3.1×106). These achievements not only underscore the efficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in industrial settings. By leveraging in situ generated formate, this innovative approach demonstrates the potential of integrating electrocatalysis with enzymatic reactions for sustainable and efficient chemical production on a practical scale.

High-resolution monitoring systems are commonly used to calculate mechanical and energy performance, as well as environmental impact resulting from the operation of a fleet of vehicles in a region. These systems require recording operational or vehicle position data, energy consumption in the case of electric or electric-assisted vehicles, and buttons for specific signals in the operation, such as the start of operation, end of operation, or package delivery. Some vehicle tracking devices available on the market do not allow speed and energy consumption data to be recorded and accessed at the required sampling frequency. This study presents the development and validation of a remote sensing device to record energy consumption and operational variables of a vehicle under real operating conditions with a frequency of 1 Hz. The functioning of the device, the integrated elements in its development, and the data analysis process are detailed. Finally, using the monitoring equipment data, a comparison was made between the operation of electric vehicles and internal combustion vehicles, achieving savings of up to 83% in operating costs and a 79% reduction in CO2 emissions.

Climate change is a serious hazard that has already harmed urban and natural systems and resulted in over $500 billion in economic losses worldwide.These problems could be partially resolved by artificial intelligence,which incorporates internet resources to provide quick recommendations based on precise climate change projections.Our research revealed that raising energy efficiency can greatly lessen the effects of climate change.Smart manufacturing, in instance, can reduce energy consumption in buildings by 30 to 50 percent.It can also reduce waste and carbon emissions by 30 to 50 percent.Artificial intelligence technologies are used by almost 70% of the world's natural gas industry to improve the precision and dependability of weather forecasts. Artificial intelligence and smart grids can be used to maximise power system efficiency and cut electricity costs by 10–20%.Intelligent transport systems have a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions potential. Furthermore,artificial intelligence may be used to manage natural resources and build resilient cities, further advancing sustainability.

Abstract The Metabolic Bone Health Department, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, serves a local population of approximately 445 000 people. A retrospective audit of attendance data regarding the Denosumab treatment clinic (the traditional treatment pathway) and the Denosumab Self Injection Programme (SIP) was conducted to determine whether the Self Injection Programme is both cost effective and environmentally beneficial, compared to the traditional treatment pathway. Cost analysis was then conducted by the Finance Department. The audit was conducted over 3 years following the implementation of the service development; 233 patients had enrolled in the program at the time of the audit and 69 had completed 3 years of self- injected treatment. A control group of 497 patients were identified by the service. This group remained on the historical pathway and had consistent attendance activity over the three-year period from 2017 to 2019. Pre and post period activity of all patients on the program was compared, together with the activity for the independent control group. The SIP resulted in a reduction in clinical contacts, with financial analysis showing a total opportunity cost saving per patient of £420 per annum. There were obvious benefits to the patient of a reduced number of visits to a clinical site, which also resulted in an estimated carbon footprint reduction of 59 KG CO2 per patient per annum. The cost analysis is based on our organisation’s 2022 charges. The SIP demonstrates that through focusing on care “closer to home”, it is possible to maximise resources, improve the patient experience through reduced travel and reduce the environmental impact of healthcare.

Sensitivity to ambient air temperatures, consuming a large amount of fuel, and wasting a significant amount of heat dumped into the ambient atmosphere are three major challenges facing gas turbine power plants. This study was conducted to simultaneously solve all three aforementioned GT problems using solar energy and introducing a new configuration that consists of solar preheating and inlet-air-cooling systems. In this study, air was preheated at a combustion chamber inlet using parabolic trough collectors. Then, inlet air to the compressor was cooled by these collectors by operating an absorption cooling cycle. At the design point conditions, this novel proposed integration resulted in a 6.87% relative increase in generated power and a 10.53% relative decrement in fuel consumption, achieving a 19.45% relative increment in the plant’s thermal efficiency. This was accompanied by a reduction of 0.026 kg/s, 4.2 kg/s, and 0.278 kg/s in CO2, CO, and NOx emissions, respectively. Finally, spider diagrams were employed to assess the impact of the operating parameters on the overall system’s performance and its associated environmental implications.

Although the thermodynamic potential of transcritical/supercritical CO2-based power cycles for next generation Concentrated Solar Power plants has been already confirmed in literature, further investigation to assess the actual feasibility of this technology from a techno-economic standpoint is needed. In fact, large uncertainty is found when it comes to the estimation of the CAPEX and OPEX of the power block, and the same can be said for the solar subsystem when high Turbine Inlet Temperatures are considered (>700 ºC). Bearing this in mind, this paper presents a methodology to map the techno-economic potential of nextgeneration Concentrated Solar Power plants running on CO2-based mixtures, with the final aim to identify the threshold (breakeven) costs of the main subsystems enabling a clear gain in terms of Levelised Cost of Electricity with respect to state-of-the-art steam-based CSP. Two different systems are studied which differ in the composition and peak temperature of the Heat Transfer Media: a SoA molten salts system operating at a TIT of 550 ºC (Gen I) and a solid particle system with TIT=700 ºC (Gen II). An integrated platform able to simulate all CSP plant subsystems and perform hourly calculations is built in Matlab employing Artificial Neural Networks to simulate the solar field, ensuring extremely high computational speed. To overcome the high uncertainty in terms of cost estimation, a two-step analysis is developed: firstly, the CAPEX of the entire plant is calculated assuming correlations from literature, except for the power block, whose estimate brings about the largest uncertainty. As a result, the minimum power block cost allowing a LCoE lower than a certain target is identified. Secondly, an inverse methodology is applied, setting the power block cost and assessing the minimum CAPEX of the solar subsystem. As a result, a map is obtained showing the target CAPEX to be accomplished by sCO2+CSP if a clear reduction of the LCoE of this technology is to be achieved.

Various soil management techniques can be used to sequester carbon in agricultural fields. With widespread implementation, these methods could sequester a substantial amount of carbon. For the purpose of removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil, various management techniques exist. The efficacy of these tactics varies depending on the region, soil type, and climate. The longevity of soil sequestration and the ideal circumstances for maximising the reduction of carbon emissions remain topics of discussion. This essay examines the process by which soil stores carbon, the current status of soil carbon research, and the controversy surrounding the potential of soil carbon. It emphasises the numerous side advantages of raising soil carbon and provides a set of suggestions for further investigation. A substantial amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) might be sequestered by switching from conventional to conservation tillage, although this change would only have a long-term impact on tillage practices. Crop rotation based on legumes is more effective than that based on grass in converting biomass carbon to soil organic carbon. Rotational grazing lowers the overall quantity of CO2 released into the atmosphere while improving the quality of the grass. Producing biochar and incorporating it into soil is an additional strategy for storing carbon from the atmosphere.

<p>A dry mix (solution-free) alkali-activated slag (a primary cementitious material) and/or fly ash based binder composition is developed that can be cast in-site and consequently cured at ambient temperature. Mortar specimens were cast by mixing slag and or fly ash, river sand, powder form alkaline activators (NaOH 14M, varying solids percentage of Na2SiO3) and water were thoroughly mixed in fabricated equipment. The dry density (28 days) of all specimens showed greater than 2200 kg/m3. The compressive strength (28 days) of all mixes was resulted in higher than 40 N/mm2. Among all the four mixes, a mix F103 with 90% slag, 10% fly ash, 30% Na2SiO3 and 14M NaOH at 3, 7 and 28 days curing showed overall higher compressive strength. It is due to fewer solids content of Na2SiO3. The experimental results indicated that solution free studied binder composite can be developed under ambient conditions eliminating other curing types without compromising in the strength. The studied sustainable mixes require only 12-15 percent water which is less compared to regular used mixes. Thus reduced water quantities can be achieved thereby protects the reduction in volume of water bodies, environment hazards, reduces CO2 emissions due to use of industrial by-products as main binders.</p>

This research, developed in the framework of the SCARABEUS project, studies the off-design performance of transcritical power cycles running on CO2-SO2 mixtures in Concentrated Solar Power applications. The objective of this work is to identify optimum operational strategies that maximise net energy production when exposed to variable ambient temperature, with special focus on the operation of the Heat Rejection Unit (Air-Cooled Condenser). The power cycle is simulated in Thermoflex, modified with user-defined scripts to account for the specific off-design performance characteristics of key components. The Air-Cooled Condenser is modelled by means of an in-house Matlab tool, already validated in previous publications, able to accurately simulate the heat transfer process between working fluid and cooling medium (air) and to calculate auxiliary power consumption. Four different strategies are identified, depending on ambient temperature: variable or constant condensation pressure for ambient temperatures lower than the design value, and constant turbine inlet temperature or constant return temperature of the heat transfer fluid for ambient temperature higher than design value. The results show that a combination of variable and constant minimum cycle pressure is the best alternative for low ambient temperatures, enabling net system efficiencies higher than 41%. On the other hand, constant turbine inlet temperature enables higher net performance than constant return temperature of the heat transfer fluid, even if at the expense of a reduction in energy storage capacity for the same inventory of molten salts.

In order to achieve a drastic reduction in CO2 emissions to limit global warming, it must be possible to globally cover the electricity demand from renewable sources. However, the fluctuating availability of solar and wind energy will nevertheless make it necessary to complement the renewables by thermal power plants. Additionally using e.g., the potentials of waste, biomass or waste heat from industrial processes locally in Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plants is a promising approach to finally achieve a stable and sustainable electricity supply. In the present work, therefore, different variants of a radial, velocity compounded re-entry cantilever turbine (Elektra turbine) are investigated regarding their potential for such applications. The paper concentrates on the fast prototyping of an existing 5 kW air turbine demonstrator, recently developed by the authors, by using the possibilities of additive manufacturing with plastic materials to substitute essential parts of the flow geometry. In this context the approach to implement the plastic parts in the turbine is explained. Experimentally determined efficiency parameters of various 3D-printed deflection channel modifications and a printed plastic wheel made of PA12GB are presented, discussed, and compared to the fully milled metal turbine. This results in a quantification of the additional losses due to the higher inaccuracies and roughness of the printed parts, which can be taken into account in further investigations. Furthermore, the various problems and hurdles that must be observed when using 3D-printed plastic parts in high-speed turbomachines are highlighted. With regard to the rotor wheel, the authors conclude that the use of additively manufactured plastic wheels is only feasible with increased preliminary testing. The time required for this is usually not in proportion to the manufacturing time and costs saved. For the stator parts however, 3D-printing turned out to be a reasonable approach.

Extreme precipitation and flooding frequency associated with global climate change are expected to increase worldwide, with major consequences in floodplains and areas susceptible to flooding. The purpose of this review was to examine the effects of flooding events on changes in soil properties and their consequences on agricultural production. Flooding is caused by natural and anthropogenic factors, and their effects can be amplified by interactions between rainfall and catchments. Flooding impacts soil structure and aggregation by altering the resistance of soil to slaking, which occurs when aggregates are not strong enough to withstand internal stresses caused by rapid water uptake. The disruption of soil aggregates can enhance soil erosion and sediment transport during flooding events and contribute to the sedimentation of water bodies and the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Total precipitation, flood discharge, and total water are the main factors controlling suspended mineral-associated organic matter, dissolved organic matter, and particulate organic matter loads. Studies conducted in paddy rice cultivation show that flooded and reduced conditions neutralize soil pH but changes in pH are reversible upon draining the soil. In flooded soil, changes in nitrogen cycling are linked to decreases in oxygen, the accumulation of ammonium, and the volatilization of ammonia. Ammonium is the primary form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in sediment porewaters. In floodplains, nitrate removal can be enhanced by high denitrification when intermittent flooding provides the necessary anaerobic conditions. In flooded soils, the reductive dissolution of minerals can release phosphorus (P) into the soil solution. Phosphorus can be mobilized during flood events, leading to increased availability during the first weeks of waterlogging, but this availability generally decreases with time. Rainstorms can promote the subsurface transport of P-enriched soil particles, and colloidal P can account for up to 64% of total P in tile drainage water. Anaerobic microorganisms prevailing in flooded soil utilize alternate electron acceptors, such as nitrate, sulfate, and carbon dioxide, for energy production and organic matter decomposition. Anaerobic metabolism leads to the production of fermentation by-products, such as organic acids, methane, and hydrogen sulfide, influencing soil pH, redox potential, and nutrient availability. Soil enzyme activity and the presence of various microbial groups, including Gram+ and Gram− bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, are affected by flooding. Waterlogging decreases the activity of β-glucosidase and acid phosphomonoesterase but increases N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase in soil. Since these enzymes control the hydrolysis of cellulose, phosphomonoesters, and chitin, soil moisture content can impact the direction and magnitude of nutrient release and availability. The supply of oxygen to submerged plants is limited because its diffusion in water is extremely low, and this impacts mitochondrial respiration in flooded plant tissues. Fermentation is the only viable pathway for energy production in flooded plants, which, under prolonged waterlogging conditions, is inefficient and results in plant death. Seed germination is also impaired under flooding stress due to decreased sugar and phytohormone biosynthesis. The sensitivity of different crops to waterlogging varies significantly across growth stages. Mitigation and adaptation strategies, essential to the management of flooding impacts on agriculture, enhance resilience to climate change through improved drainage and water management practices, soil amendments and rehabilitation techniques, best management practices, such as zero tillage and cover crops, and the development of flood-tolerant crop varieties. Technological advances play a crucial role in assessing flooding dynamics and impacts on crop production in agricultural landscapes. This review embarks on a comprehensive journey through existing research to unravel the intricate interplay between flooding events, agricultural soil, crop production, and the environment. We also synthesize available knowledge to address critical gaps in understanding, identify methodological challenges, and propose future research directions.

This study investigates the synthesis of gold nanoparticles and surface modifications to enable their utilization as a colorimetric sensor strip on electrospun nanofibrous. Additionally, it utilizes cellulose acetate electrospun fiber preparations as substrates for loading the gold nanoparticles. In order to produce gold nanoparticles, citrate reduction was employed, followed by modification with maleic acid (MA-GNPs). MA-GNPs were significantly more selective for Pb2+ than for other ions (Co2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni+), according to the results. Following the introduction of Pb2+, the solutions exhibited a color change from red to blue or purple, which was attributed to the aggregation of nanoparticles, as determined by UV-Vis spectrometry. An optical band indicative of GNPs and MA-GNPs was detected at an estimated wavelength of 520 nm. Approximately 600 nanometers after the addition of Pb2+, the intensity of the solution progressively decreased to 520 nanometers, and a new band emerged. To fabricate cellulose acetate nanofibrous via electrospinning, the impact of solvent ratios, polymer concentrations, and process conditions were investigated. The ideal parameters for the fabrication of the substrate were as follows: 15%w/w polymer solution, 15 kV electrospinning voltage, 15 cm needle-to-collector distance, and 48 hours of collecting time. In order to examine the color change of the prepared strip, it is observed that the strip transforms from red to blue upon exposure to Pb2+ ions of varying concentrations, just as it does in solution form. An examination of water samples indicated that the strip remained colorless when tested with DI water. However, testing with wastewater sourced from a battery facility identified a transformation of the strip from red to purplish blue. This is equivalent to an estimated lead concentration of 40 parts per million. The outcomes showcased the capacity of the discolored strips to identify the preliminary concentration of lead ions, suggesting potential for future advancements in this area.

Functional textile are one of the most critical fields in the textile industry and textile materials science. In recent years, advanced technologies in textile processing have become relevant in order to improve its usability. In the production of various types of functional textile, one of the methods is the modification of textile surfaces. To improve the properties of the textile surface, magnetron vacuum sputtering and laser post-processing technologies can be used, which in general gives the material new or improved properties and functionalities. In this study, mixed fiber fabrics containing polyester, protal and cotton fibers are used to determine how laser post-treatment of the metalized fabrics impact the adhesive properties between fabric and deposited metal. The following materials were used for magnetron vacuum sputtering for functional textile coatings: Cu, Al, Ti, Ag. Individually or by combining these metals, it is possible to assign the textile such properties as: electromagnetic, UV and IR radiation shielding; antistatic, antibacterial, hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, as well as increasing wear resistance. In this study a 100 W continuous wave CO2 laser with a wavelength of 10.6 µm is used for post-treatment of magnetron vacuum sputtered modified textile surfaces. The study's conclusions point towards a tailored approach in determining linear energy densities that bolster adhesion for each metal-textile combination, which is essential for the development of durable and functional advanced textile. The patterns noted in the adhesion strengths, influenced by different energy densities and metal types, highlight the intricate relationship between the thermal impact of laser treatment and the inherent characteristics of the metals deposited. Some metals demonstrated improved adhesion at lower energy densities. However, a general trend emerged showing a reduction in the strength of adhesion as the energy density increased, especially when surpassing certain energy levels.    

    

## Using historical temperature to constrain the climate sensitivity, the transient climate response, and aerosol-induced cooling

Abstract. The most recent generation of climate models that has informed the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is characterized by the presence of several models with larger equilibrium climate sensitivities (ECSs) and transient climate responses (TCRs) than exhibited by the previous generation. Partly as a result, AR6 did not use any direct quantifications of ECSs and TCRs based on the 4×CO2 and 1pctCO2 simulations and relied on other evidence when assessing the Earth's actual ECS and TCR. Here I use historical observed global-mean temperature and simulations produced under the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project to constrain the ECS, TCR, and historical aerosol-related cooling. I introduce additivity criteria that disqualify 8 of the participating 16 models from consideration in multi-model averaging calculations. Based on the remaining eight models, I obtain an average adjusted ECS of 3.5 ± 0.4 K and a TCR of 1.8 ± 0.3 K (both at 68 % confidence). Both are consistent with the AR6 estimates but with substantially reduced uncertainties. Furthermore, importantly I find that the optimal cooling due to short-lived climate forcers consistent with the observed temperature record should, on average, be about 47 % ± 39 % of what these models simulate in their aerosol-only simulations, yielding a multi-model mean, global-mean, and annual-mean cooling due to near-term climate forcers for 2000–2014, relative to 1850–1899, of 0.24 ± 0.11 K (at 68 % confidence). This is consistent with but at the lower end of the very likely uncertainty range of the IPCC's AR6. There is a correlation between the models' ECSs and their aerosol-related cooling, whereby large-ECS models tend to be associated also with strong aerosol-related cooling. The results imply that a reduction in the aerosol-related cooling, along with a more moderate adjustment of the greenhouse-gas-related warming for most models, would bring the historical global-mean temperature simulated by these models into better agreement with observations.

This research evaluates the feasibility of using eucalyptus oil blended with conventional diesel fuel in diesel engines. Eucalyptus globulus is one of the main tree species cultivated for paper pulp in western European countries such as Portugal, and eucalyptus oil is one of the byproducts that so far has not been sufficiently evaluated as a biofuel. This study assesses the impact of using this additive on engine performance parameters and emissions as a means to contribute to reducing fossil fuel consumption and pollutant and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The analysis revealed that the addition of eucalyptus oil had a positive effect on torque, a critical performance parameter, with biofuel blends showing consistent torque increases at lower engine speeds. However, torque tended to decrease towards the higher range of engine speed for eucalyptus oil–diesel blends. Several blends showed lower brake specific fuel consumption compared to regular diesel at high engine loads and low engine speeds. Brake thermal efficiency did not vary substantially at lower engine speeds and loads but decreased at higher speeds and loads. Pollutant emissions, particularly unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, were influenced by fuel composition, with biofuel blends showing both increases and decreases compared to diesel. It is noteworthy that eucalyptus oil blends exhibited up to a 60% reduction in smoke opacity under specific operating conditions at low speed and high load for 10% incorporation (10EU90D), suggesting that in addition to the already positive effects of cutting down fossil CO2 emissions in proportion to the substitution of fossil diesel with nearly carbon-neutral eucalyptus oil, more environmental benefits may be expected from the incorporation of this product. Although the present economic viability of using eucalyptus oil as a biofuel is still not guaranteed, the present study seems to reinforce its technical viability. Future prospects for the improvement of oil yield through biotechnology, the economic interest of this product for several countries, and the updating and upscaling industrial processes may allow the viability of this biofuel to remain a possibility in the future

Background and aim Colonoscopy is the gold-standard screening test for colorectal cancer. However, it has come under scrutiny for its carbon footprint and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to other medical procedures. Notwithstanding, screening colonoscopies may have a positive effect on GHG emissions that is unknown. This study estimated the carbon emissions prevented by screening colonoscopies in the U.S. Methods Using the reported number of screening colonoscopies performed annually in the U.S. and the absolute risk reduction (ARR) reported in the NorDICC trial, we calculated the expected minimum number of cancer treatment and surveillance visits prevented through screening based on the cancer stage. The average carbon emission averted per mile traveled was computed using the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) GHG equivalencies calculator. The final estimate of carbon emissions averted over a decade by screening colonoscopies performed in one year was determined. Result 6.3 million screening colonoscopies performed in one year prevent 1,134,000 colorectal cancers over a ten-year period. Of these, 38∙3% (434,254) are localized, 38∙8% (440,281) are regional, and 22∙9% (259,465) are metastatic disease. The minimum number of post-diagnosis visits prevented is 11 for stage I, ≥ 21 for stage II, ≥25 for stage III, and ≥ 20 for stage IV disease, comprised of diagnostic, surgical evaluation, chemotherapy, and surveillance visits. The total number of visits prevented by screening is 2,388,397 for stage I, 5,254,421 for stage II, 13,120,369 for stage III, and 9,210,972 for stage IV disease. Approximately 395 million miles of travel and 158,263 metric tons of CO2, equivalent to 177 million pounds of coal burned, 19 billion smartphones charged, or 18 million gallons of gasoline consumed, were saved over ten years through screening. Conclusion Colorectal cancer screening decreases cancer-related GHG emissions and minimizes the environmental impact of cancer treatment.

Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) and municipal solid wastes (MSWs) have been found to be viable sources of clean energy. This study integrates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for methane flow rate estimation in the software Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning-Integrated Benefit Calculator (LEAP-IBC) system to estimate and project the methane emissions coming from the waste generated by Metro Manila, disposed in sanitary landfills. It aims to analyze the environmental impacts of the emissions coming from the non-energy sector using the IBC feature of LEAP and by developing two scenarios with 2010 and 2050 as the base and end years: the baseline and methane recovery scenario, where the latter represents the solid waste management undertaken to counter the emissions. Under the baseline, 97.30 million metric tonnes of methane emissions are expected to be produced and are predicted to continuously increase. In the same scenario, the cities of Quezon, Manila, and Caloocan account for the biggest methane emissions. On the other hand, in the methane recovery scenario, the methane emissions are expected to have a decline of 36% from 127.036 to 81.303 million metric tonnes by 2025, 52% from 135.358 to 64.972 million metric tonnes by 2030, and 54% from 150.554 to 69.254 million metric tonnes by 2040. For the 40-year projection of the study under the 100-year global warming potential analysis, a total of 10,249 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent is avoided in the methane recovery compared to the BAU, and a maximum of 0.019 °C temperature increase can also be avoided. Moreover, electricity costs without LFG technology increase from 2.21 trillion to 8.75 trillion, while costs with LFG technology also rise but remain consistently lower, ranging from 2.20 trillion to 8.74 trillion. This consistent reduction in electricity costs underscores the long-term value and importance of adopting LFG technology, even as its relative savings impact diminishes over time. Finally, the fixed effects and random effects panel data regression analysis reinforces and asserts that the solid waste management is really improved by means of the methane recovery technology, leading the methane emissions to decrease.

(English) The rapid growth of Mexico’s urban population and the highly exposed vulnerability of the country to natural hazards and climate risk are aspects that need to be considered for the actual adaptation of the infrastructure to ensure the safety of all the residents. Last decade, private construction companies and the public administration in Mexico built different large-scale social housing projects for low-income occupants to provide a house to the most vulnerable population considering natural hazards and climate risk. The quality of the buildings is getting worse with time causing health problems, non-inclusive spaces, poor architectural flexibility, expensive maintenance, and poor environmental performance, among others. Having said that, the leading question of this study is: How to design a more sustainable and resilient incremental social house in Mexico City considering social, environmental, and economic aspects? The main limitation of this proposal is to respect the budget from the Mexican public administration designated to social housing projects. To deal with economic restrictions of Mexican public administration, the incremental housing concept proposed in this study could be used to answer (1) current housing needs for most low-income families in Mexico City, (2) provide an affordable initial core housing with spatial flexibility for future housing expansion, (3) provide a more environmentally sustainable social housing design in terms of the entire life cycle of the construction considering energy consumption and water consumption and CO2 emissions. Therefore, this research study presents a methodology, which is a combination of BIM (Building Information Modelling) and MIVES (Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessment), to assess the three main pillars of sustainability in incremental social housing design. To validate the methodology, first it is applied to three existing incremental housing cases, which are scenario A in Mexico, scenario B in Puerto Rico and scenario C in Indonesia, sharing similar characteristics such as construction area, construction cost per m2 and high-risk flooding location in developing economies. As well as, the same methodology is applied to elaborate a design elaborated by the author called MICASA, to find the best architectural solutions for an incremental social housing in Mexico City. The results show that the BIM-MIVES methodology is a useful tool for decision-making to improve the sustainability of social housing design in Mexico City. In this study, the proposal design, MICASA, shows 45% less CO2 emissions, 38% less energy consumption and 68% less solid waste than scenario A. MICASA is 2.5 times more expensive per m2 than scenario A, however, MICASA respects the cost limit assigned by the public administration for a low-income housing construction in Mexico City with a construction cost of 546.45 euros/m2. Considering social and environmental requirements, MICASA is the most sustainable case study compared to scenario A, B and C. The findings of this study suggest that it is feasible to design more sustainable social housing developments in Mexico City considering the environmental impact reduction, life-cycle cost and social acceptance respecting construction budget limitations. (Español) El rápido crecimiento de la población urbana de México y la vulnerabilidad altamente expuesta del país a los peligros naturales y el riesgo climático son aspectos que deben considerarse para la adaptación de la infraestructura y garantizar la seguridad y el bienestar de todos los residentes. La década pasada, empresas constructoras privadas y la administración pública en México construyeron diferentes proyectos de vivienda social de gran escala para ocupantes de bajos ingresos y en algunos consideraron en el diseño los peligros naturales de las diferentes zonas. La calidad de estas edificaciones va empeorando con el tiempo provocando problemas de salubridad, espacios no inclusivos, poca flexibilidad arquitectónica, mantenimiento constante debido a la precaria calidad de los materiales, un pobre desempeño ambiental, entre otros. Dicho esto, la pregunta principal de este estudio es: ¿Cómo diseñar una vivienda social incremental más sostenible y resiliente en la Ciudad de México considerando aspectos sociales, ambientales y económicos? La principal limitación de esta propuesta es respetar el presupuesto de la administración pública mexicana destinado a este tipo de desarrollos de vivienda. Para hacer frente a las restricciones económicas de la administración pública mexicana, la estrategia de vivienda incremental, es propuesta en este estudio. Esta estrategia podría usarse para: (1) responder a las necesidades actuales de vivienda para la mayoría de las familias de ingresos bajos en la Ciudad de México, (2) proporcionar una vivienda básica inicial asequible con flexibilidad espacial para la futura expansión, (3) proporcionar un diseño de vivienda social más sostenible ambientalmente en todo su ciclo de vida considerando el consumo de energía y agua, y las emisiones de CO2 . Dicho esto, esta investigación presenta una metodología, que en combinación de BIM (Building Information Modelling) y MIVES (Modelo Integrado de Valor para una Evaluación Sostenible), evalúa los tres pilares principales de la sostenibilidad en el diseño de vivienda social incremental. Para validar esta metodología, está se aplica a tres casos de vivienda incremental existentes, que son los casos de estudio A, B y C, y que comparten características similares como área de construcción, costo de construcción por m2 y localización en una zona de alto riesgo de inundación en economías en desarrollo, entre otras. Asimismo, esta metodología es aplicada a un diseño elaborado por el autor, para encontrar las mejores soluciones arquitectónicas para la vivienda social incremental en la Ciudad de México. Los resultados muestran que la nueva metodología propuesta de BIM-MIVES es útil para la toma de decisiones para mejorar la sustentabilidad del diseño de vivienda social en la Ciudad de México. En este estudio, el diseño de la propuesta (MICASA) muestra un 45% menos de emisiones de CO2 , un 38% menos de consumo de energía y un 68% menos de residuos sólidos que el escenario A. MICASA es 2,5 veces más caro por m2 que el escenario A, sin embargo, MICASA respeta el límite de costo asignado por la administración pública para la construcción de una vivienda de interés social en la Ciudad de México con un costo de construcción de 546,45 euros/m2 . Teniendo en cuenta los requisitos sociales y ambientales, MICASA es el estudio de caso más sostenible en comparación con los escenarios A, B y C. Finalmente, este estudio sugiere que es factible diseñar desarrollos de vivienda social más sostenibles en la Ciudad de México considerando la reducción del impacto ambiental, el costo del ciclo de vida y la aceptación social respetando las limitaciones del presupuesto de construcción.

[Clara Borén Altés](https://openalex.org/A5001105925), No host. None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.5821/dissertation-2117-412171.
    
(English) A significant proportion of global carbon dioxide emissions are attributed to ocean-sailing ships. These shipping emissions are predicted to double in less than 30 years. In this sense, it is mandatory to develop tools and methods for a proper assessment of the air contaminants emitted by vessels as the basis for developing efficient policies also enhancing best practices on board. From an academic point of view, the training of seafarers is the backbone of success in emissions abatement as their actions and knowledge have a direct impact on ships operation. From a theoretical point of view, the objective of this thesis is to analyse the effects on emissions abatement of the two operational techniques, i. e. weather ship routing and slow steaming, used in the shipping industry to reduce fuel consumption taking also into consideration future seafarers’ education on the mentioned techniques. Firstly, this thesis merges the estimation of shipping pollutants and their mitigation through weather routing optimisation; two lines of research widely analysed separately but seldom discussed together. An open software of weather ship routing is used to obtain the minimum cost (i.e. optimised route) in terms of sailing time, using high-resolution wave forecasting analysing several scenarios for a Ro-Pax vessel sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. The assessment of fuel consumption and ship emissions calculations have been inspired by a bottom-up methodology, in conjunction with the estimation of the power increase needed to overcome speed decrement due to waves. The ship routing optimisation reveals a reduction up to 30% of ship emissions during severe storms on longer routes. Nevertheless, all the cases studied show emissions mitigation when ship routing optimisation is used. The expected increase of extreme weather events, in terms of frequency, intensity and duration due to climate change, suggests a gradual gain of implementing weather ship routing optimisation in all types of routes, regardless of the distance. Secondly, this contribution also investigates the effect on fuel consumption and emissions when vessels are sailing below the design speed (i.e. slow steaming), as a strategy to minimize fuel consumption. The estimation of fuel consumption is commonly based on the cubic speed- power relation as a bottom-up approach. Nevertheless, the cubic relation could overestimate the impact of slow steaming on fuel consumption reduction and the emissions assessment. Container ships real fuel consumption data is compared with the results of assessing these parameters from a bottom-up approach. The exponential values obtained for the speed- power relation show an overrating over 20%. Moreover, this section shows the results of the additional emissions savings in the framework of ship-specific measures when weather ship routing and slow steaming are applied simultaneously. Based on the results obtained, the present thesis proposes a weather ship routing software developed at the Barcelona School of Nautical Studies (UPC-Tech) as a new teaching tool for distance and face-to-face education, which has the aim to assess some knowledge of several competences of the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) code on weather routing and emissions abatement. The results of a teaching trial carried out alternatively at sea (distance education) and onshore (face-to-face education) are compared in terms of competences acquisition in the Maritime Education and Training framework. Results indicate that, in the context of maritime training, there are no significant differences between students enrolled in a face-to-face or in a distance environment and results also demonstrate that the proposed software represents an innovative teaching tool that can be used by all Maritime Education and Traning Institutions. (Català) Una part important de les emissions mundials de diòxid de carboni s'atribueix als vaixells mercants i es preveu que les emissions del transport marítim es dupliquin en menys de 30 anys. En aquest sentit, és d’una importància cabdal desenvolupar eines i mètodes per a una avaluació correcta de contaminants atmosfèrics emesos pels vaixells per tal que sigui la base del desenvolupament de polítiques eficients i de l’ús de les millors pràctiques a bord. Des del punt de vista acadèmic, la formació i conscienciació de la gent de mar és l’eix vertebrador de l’èxit en la reducció d’emissions, ja que les seves accions i coneixements tenen un impacte directe en l’explotació dels vaixells. Des d’un punt de vista teòric, l’objectiu d’aquesta tesi és analitzar l’impacte en les emissions de l’aplicació de dues tècniques operatives, com són l’optimització meteorològica de rutes i la reducció de velocitat de navegació, utilitzades en la indústria naviliera per reduir les emissions, tenint en compte també la formació de la futura gent de mar sobre les esmentades tècniques. Conseqüentment, aquesta tesi contribueix a l’Objectiu de Desenvolupament Sostenible número 13 de les Nacions Unides d’Acció pel clima. D'una banda, la present contribució combina l'estimació dels contaminants del transport marítim i la seva mitigació mitjançant l'optimització rutes. S'utilitza un programari obert d’optimització de rutes de vaixells mitjançant la meteorologia que ha estat desenvolupat a la Facultat de Nàutica de Barcelona per obtenir el cost mínim (és a dir, una ruta optimitzada) en termes de temps de navegació, utilitzant previsions d'onatge d'alta resolució per a un vaixell Ro-Pax navegant pel Mar Mediterrani. L'optimització de rutes revela una reducció de fins a un 30% de les emissions dels vaixells durant les tempestes severes en les rutes més llargues. No obstant això, tots els casos estudiats mostren una mitigació d'emissions quan s'utilitza l'optimització de rutes. L'augment esperat d'esdeveniments meteorològics extrems, en termes de freqüència, intensitat i durada a causa del canvi climàtic, suggereix un guany gradual d'implementar l'optimització de rutes mitjançant la meteorologia en tot tipus de rutes, independentment de la distància. D'altra banda, aquesta contribució també investiga l'efecte sobre el consum de combustible i les emissions quan els vaixells naveguen per sota de la velocitat de disseny (és a dir, en condició de navegació lenta o ”slow steaming”, SS), com a estratègia per minimitzar el consum de combustible. L'estimació del consum de combustible es basa habitualment en la relació cúbica velocitat-potència. No obstant això, la relació cúbica podria sobreestimar l'impacte de l’”slow steaming” en la reducció del consum de combustible i l'avaluació d'emissions. Es comparen les dades de consum de combustible real de vaixells portacontenidors amb els resultats de l'avaluació d'aquests paràmetres des d'un enfocament ascendent mostrant una sobreestimació dels beneficis de l’SS superior al 20%. En funció dels resultats obtinguts, aquesta contribució proposa un programari d’optimització de rutes marítimes segons la meteorologia com a eina docent per a l'ensenyament a distància i presencial, que té com a objectiu avaluar alguns coneixements de diverses competències del codi Estàndards de Formació, Certificació i Vigilància de la gent de mar (STCW) sobre l’optimització de rutes i la reducció d'emissions. Es comparen els resultats d'un assaig docent realitzat alternativament al mar (educació a distància) i a terra (ensenyament presencial) pel que fa a l'adquisició de competències en el marc d'Educació i Formació Marítimes. Els resultats indiquen que, en el context de la formació marítima, no hi ha diferències significatives entre els estudiants matriculats en un entorn presencial o a distancia i també demostren que el software proposat és una eina didàctica innovadora que pot ser utilitzada per qualsevol Institució d'Educació Marítima Superior. (Español) Una parte importante de las emisiones globales de dióxido de carbono se atribuyen a buques mercantes y se prevé que las emisiones del transporte marítimo se dupliquen en menos de 30 años. En este sentido, es de vital importancia desarrollar herramientas y metodologías para una correcta evaluación de contaminantes atmosféricos emitidos por los buques para que sirva de base para el desarrollo de políticas eficientes y para el uso de buenas prácticas abordo. Desde el punto de vista académico, la formación y concienciación de la gente de mar es el eje vertebrador del éxito en la reducción de emisiones, puesto que sus acciones y conocimientos tienen un impacto directo en la explotación de los buques. Desde un punto de vista teórico, el objetivo de esta tesis es analizar el impacto sobre las emisiones de dos técnicas operativas, como son la optimización meteorológica de rutas y la reducción de la velocidad de navegación, utilizadas en la industria naviera para reducir emisiones, teniendo en cuenta también la formación de los futuros marinos sobre las citadas técnicas. En primer lugar, la presente contribución fusiona la estimación de los contaminantes del transporte marítimo y su mitigación a través de la optimización de las rutas según las condiciones meteo-oceanográficas encontradas. Para tal efecto, se utiliza un software de optimización de rutas de navegación de acceso abierto desarrollado en la Facultad de Náutica de Barcelona (UPC-Tech) para obtener el costo mínimo (es decir, la ruta optimizada) en términos de tiempo de navegación, utilizando pronósticos de oleaje de alta resolución para un buque Ro-Pax navegando en el Mar Mediterraneo. La optimización de las rutas estudiadas revela una reducción de hasta el 30% de las emisiones durante tormentas severas. Sin embargo, todos los casos estudiados muestran mitigación de emisiones cuando se utiliza la optimización de rutas. El esperado aumento de eventos climáticos extremos, en términos de frecuencia, intensidad y duración debido al cambio climático, sugiere una ganancia gradual en la implementación de la optimización de rutas de buques en todo tipo de rutas, independientemente de la distancia. En segundo lugar, esta contribución también investiga el efecto sobre el consumo de combustible y las emisiones cuando los buques navegan por debajo de la velocidad de diseño (i.e. slow steaming, SS), como estrategia para minimizar el consumo de combustible. La estimación del consumo de combustible se basa comúnmente en la relación cúbica velocidad-potencia. Sin embargo, la relación cúbica aplicada a cualquier velocidad de navegación podría sobrestimar el beneficio del slow steaming en la reducción del consumo de combustible y la evaluación de emisiones derivadas de dicho consumo. En esta contribución, se comparan los datos de consumo real de combustible de varios buques portacontenedores con los resultados de la evaluación teórica de estos parámetros desde un enfoque ascendente mostrando una sobrevaloración de los beneficios del SS superior al 20%. En base a los resultados obtenidos, esta contribución propone un software de optimización de rutas como herramienta didáctica para la educación a distancia y presencial, que tiene como objetivo evaluar parte del conocimiento de algunas competencias del código Estándares de Formación, Certificación y Vigilancia de la gente de mar (STCW) sobre optimización de rutas y mitigación de emisiones. Se comparan los resultados de la enseñanza realizada alternativamente a distancia (en la mar) y presencial (en tierra) en términos de adquisición de competencias en el marco de la Educación y Formación Marítimas. Los resultados indican que, en el contexto de la formación marítima, no existen diferencias significativas entre los alumnos matriculados en un entorno presencial o a distancia y también demuestran que el software propuesto es una herramienta de enseñanza innovadora que puede ser utilizada por cualquier Institución de Educación Marítima Superior.
