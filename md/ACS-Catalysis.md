Transition-metal-catalyzed enantioselective C–H functionalization has emerged as a promising method for the synthesis of P-stereogenic phosphorus compounds. However, previous reports are limited to the enantioselective functionalization of C(sp2)–H bonds of aryl phosphine derivatives. Herein, Pd(II)-catalyzed enantioselective arylation of more challenging C(sp3)–H bonds toward P-stereogenic dialkylphosphinamides is achieved through the desymmetrization of gem-diethyl groups. Various P-stereogenic dialkylphosphinamides are obtained with high enantioselectivities using 3,3′-CN2-H8-BINOL as the chiral ligand. The synthetic potential of this methodology is highlighted by gram-scale preparation and further derivatizations.

The high conductivity and low decomposition potential of LiOH as the discharge product in Li–O2 batteries have garnered significant attention. However, challenges remain in developing LiOH-based Li–O2 batteries and promoting efficient generation/decomposition of LiOH. Here, we propose a strategy to build a binder-free cathode for Li–O2 batteries by embedding atomically dispersed Ru onto the surface of MnCo2O4 (RuSA-MnCo2O4) through defect engineering and adsorption–deposition methods, harnessing the synergistic benefits of spinel and a single atom in terms of catalytic activity and physical structure. The embedding of Ru leads to slight lattice distortion of MnCo2O4 and electron enrichment near Co, breaking the long-range ordered and symmetrical structure of spinel and transforming the symmetrical Mn/Co low-activity centers into asymmetrical Ru–O–Co high-activity centers. Compared to that of MnCo2O4, the d-band center of RuSA-MnCo2O4 is positioned further away from the Fermi level, resulting in an increased occupancy of antibonding orbitals. This leads to more moderate adsorption energies for LiO2* and LiOH*, as well as a reduction in the reaction barrier for LiOH formation, thereby optimizing the kinetics of the redox reactions. Thanks to the catalytic active center regulated by RuSA, the electrochemical performances were greatly improved, which also provides a clever approach for the development of catalysts for LiOH-based Li–O2 batteries.

In the recently burgeoning field of asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloaddition, a challenging hurdle lies in achieving a multilevel control of chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities in cross-coupling photoreactions, which often result in chaotic outcomes when partners show similar electronic and optical properties. Here, we introduce a biomimetic cage-pocket confined photocatalytic protocol that can effectively realize bimolecular recognition and manipulate excited triplet-state dynamics through stereochemical confinement. This approach allows for highly selective synthesis of heterocoupled [2 + 2] syn-HH (head-to-head) enantiomers from two photoactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, which are typically difficult to access via conventional strategies due to competitive pathways. We find that the cooperative heteromolecular binding dynamics plays a critical role in initial chemoselective and successive stereoselective photoreactions. Notably, the open pockets of the cage reactor display tolerable guest–host match but products–host mismatch for a wide scope of substrates, overcoming common limitations associated with enzyme-mimicking cage reactors such as guest specificity and product inhibition against catalytic generality and turnover.

The application of selective catalytic reduction with ammonia (NH3-SCR) technology urgently requires catalysts with good performance to control nitrogen oxide (NOx, x = 1, 2) emissions, and structural analysis of such catalysts is necessary and crucial to elucidate the performance of catalytically active sites. Thus, we prepared molybdenum (Mo)-doped CeO2 catalysts to achieve a substantial leap in catalytic performance. The results revealed that the emergence of Ce3+–O–Ce3+ structural units induced by Mo doping achieved the low-energy barrier activation of the NH3 molecule, which transformed the dominant reaction mechanism in the catalytic reaction and thus led to a much better SCR performance. Furthermore, we designed tungsten (W)-doped CeO2 catalysts with the same doping amount as Mo and found that the catalysts exhibited almost the same activity trend as the Mo-doped CeO2 catalysts, which further confirmed the pivotal role of the Ce3+–O–Ce3+ structural units. This study provides a basic theoretical foundation for the design of ceria-based SCR catalysts with efficient catalytic performance for NOx removal.

Homogeneous catalysts─organometallic complexes but also organocatalysts or nanoparticle catalysts─display attractive features that are of high academic and industrial interest. Various concepts have been established for their integrated recycling in the realization of industrial processes with metal complexes to achieve quasistationary operation. With the constant development of novel synthetic tools and improved catalyst structures, innovative methods for their effective recycling remain an important and thoroughly investigated research objective. However, recycling experiments of homogeneous catalysts on a laboratory scale need to be carried out using reliable and generalized methods to collect valuable data that allow for conclusive comparison of different approaches. In this Perspective, we first analyze and categorize the industrial applied techniques for recycling of organometallic catalysts and then present and evaluate performance indicators of recycling methods on the research stage. As a conclusion, a best practice for planning and conducting experimental studies is suggested to generate and present comparable results across different laboratories and disciplines.

Reduction of oxides of carbon (CO and CO2) to fixed forms of carbon is desirable to achieve sustainable and clean energy. Carbon monoxide (CO), an intermediate product in CO2 reduction, is challenging to reduce, which in turn jeopardizes the direct reduction of CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ to products like CH3OH and CH4. Iron porphyrins can efficiently reduce CO2 to CO by 2e–/2H+, but further reduction is halted by the rapid dissociation of CO from the reduced iron center. This work shows that CO can indeed be reduced upon inclusion of a pendent pyridine in the second coordination sphere of an iron porphyrin complex efficiently and selectively to CH4 using water or phenol as the proton source. In situ spectro-electrochemistry supported by theoretical calculations indicates that the pendent pyridine moiety imposes a hydrogen bonding interaction between the bound CO and water, which stabilizes two low-valent CO adducts, i.e., Fe(I)–CO and Fe(0)–CO, of iron porphyrins, allowing its complete reduction, via a Fe(II)–CHO species, to CH4. The ability to activate and reduce CO by ne–/nH+ via a second-sphere hydrogen bonding interaction in a mononuclear iron porphyrin opens newer pathways to valorize both CO and CO2 to valuable C1 products.

PtlD, a multifunctional mononuclear nonheme iron and α-ketoglutarate-dependent (NHFe/α-KG) dioxygenase involved in neopentalenoketolactone biosynthesis, catalyzes hydroxylation, desaturation, and olefin epoxidation reactions. Investigating desaturation reactions of nonactivated carbons mediated by NHFe/α-KG enzymes is intriguing, especially for understanding the fate of the substrate radicals formed after hydrogen atom abstraction by FeIV═O species. Here, we investigate the desaturation reaction mechanism of PtlD using two distinct substrates: neopentalenolactone D (1) features a lone pair-containing oxygen atom adjacent to the olefin-forming carbon atoms, whereas pentalenolactone D (7) harbors a carbonyl group at the corresponding position. For substrate 1, our isotope effect measurement and protein mutagenesis experiments suggest the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which is subsequently deprotonated by a base to generate the desaturation products. Residue K288 serves as the base, while Y113 likely stabilizes the carbocation via a π-cation interaction. For substrate 7, oxygen incorporation patterns indicated that a carbocation intermediate is also formed but is unstable, leading to hydroxylation due to H2O quenching. Notably, substrate 7's desaturation exhibits a temperature-dependent large kinetic isotope effect (KIE) and an inverse solvent isotope effect (SIE), suggesting that hydrogen tunneling contributes to the electron–proton transfer (EPT) process. These findings collectively reveal the cases of NHFe/α-KG enzymes, where distinct desaturation mechanisms switch with different substrates.

Dehydration of alcohols into alkenes is a key reaction for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass. However, the mechanism of these reactions is highly questionable, hindering the rational optimization of efficient catalysts. In the present work, the formation of linear butenes starting from isobutanol catalyzed by proton-exchanged zeolites is unraveled by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). Comparison with static calculations done for a gas phase reaction catalyzed by a proton and for the prototypical chabazite zeolite framework shows that AIMD estimations of the free energy barriers are significantly different from the static ones. Moreover, a common transition state (TS) is found for two competing reactions, namely, the isomerization of isobutanol into butan-2-ol (the dehydration of the latter yielding linear butenes) and the synchronous dehydration and isomerization of isobutanol into products related to linear butenes in a single step. The existence of a post-TS bifurcation prevents a traditional estimation of rates by transition state theory. To circumvent this problem, we quantify relative transmission coefficients using the Bennett–Chandler theory, which shows a clear tendency for decrease of relative frequency for isobutanol isomerization and increase of that for synchronous dehydration and isomerization when switching from 100 to 500 K. This work represents a step forward for the accurate determination of rates for key reactions in alcohol dehydration reactions.

FeN4 active sites have been studied as non-Pt group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The authors recently developed Fe(II) 1,14:7,8-ditethenotetrapyrido-[2,1,6-de:2′,1′6′-gh:2″,1″,6″-na][1,3,5,8,10,12] hexaazacyclotetradecine (Fe-14MR) as an FeN4 complex incorporating a 14-membered ring. This complex exhibited higher ORR activity and greater durability than Fe phthalocyanine, a conventional FeN4 complex having a 16-membered ring. In the present study, the ORR activity and durability of this Fe-14MR complex supported on C (Fe-14MR/C) were enhanced through modification of the active site structure by heating at 600 °C and removing protons on amine groups in the Fe-14MR. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Fe-14MR/C structure generated by heating resulted in oxygen species absorption energies close to optimal values for the ORR. The improved durability of the heat-treated Fe-14MR/C was attributed to reduced distortion of the FeN4 sites. The results suggest that designing Fe-14MR structures can be a promising approach to developing non-PGM catalysts.
