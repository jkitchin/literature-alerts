Amino acid esters serve as crucial intermediates in protein synthesis and as common structural elements in biologically active natural compounds. Herein, we present an efficient radical cascade reaction involving 1,2-nitrogen migration and C(sp2)–H intramolecular cyclization, enabling access to a diverse array of β-amino acid motifs. Upon cooperative Ni/diboron catalysis, a π-system-independent 1,2-N-shift of β-bromo α-amino acid esters is achieved, which allows the formation of two new bonds, including a C(sp3)–C(sp2) bond and a C(sp3)–N bond. The cascade reaction exhibits extensive substrate compatibility and high diastereoselectivity and proceeds without the need for oxidants, toxic radical initiators, and/or elevated temperatures. It has been observed that diboron compounds serve as both an activating reagent for inert C–N bond cleavage/migration and a reductant for the Ni catalytic cycle. This sheds light on the radical remote migration of N-functionalities without the need for π-systems. The radical cascades involving a 1,2-N-shift followed by intermolecular halogenation or selenation are also demonstrated.

Enzymes have selectivity, require mild catalytic conditions, and are important cornerstones in many industrial catalytic processes. Protein self-cyclization has opened up the possibility of preserving fragile enzymes during long-term high-temperature catalysis. However, the mechanism for self-cyclization and improvement of thermal tolerance have not been elucidated, severely limiting their industrial applications. Herein, we provide a strategy for the rational design of fusion proteins based on structural analysis to obtain cyclized enzymes with improved properties. First, we constructed fusion proteins that preferentially translated SpyCatcher (CBT) or SpyTag (TBC), both of which could form stable single self-cyclization with significantly improved thermal tolerance. Especially, the thermal half-life of TBC obtained by modifying the N-terminal SpyTag at 40 °C was 10.83 times that of wild enzymes. Structural analysis revealed that the terminus of the protein, which preferentially translated to SpyCatcher, folded into a conformation that adversely affected stability. In addition, the structure of the catalytic pocket and the orientation of the catalytic residues of CBT were significantly different from those of the wild-type enzymes, which led to a decrease in the catalytic activity. These conclusions were confirmed when another industrial enzyme, sucrose phosphorylase, was cyclized. Finally, the cyclized glucosidase was also superior to the wild-type strain for the preparation of ginsenoside F1 at high titers and as a whole-cell catalyst for extended use. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that conjugated long oligopeptide SpyCatcher significantly affected the catalytic activity and stability of cyclized enzymes. It was necessary to preferentially translate units with less steric hindrance to reduce their impact on the protein structure. The rational design of cyclized enzymes based on structural analysis provides a simple and effective strategy for the modification of industrial enzymes with poor thermal tolerance, providing considerable prospects for biosynthesis in vivo and in vitro.

The oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by lipoxygenases (LOXs) is initiated by a C–H cleavage step in which the hydrogen atom is transferred quantum mechanically (i.e., via tunneling). In these reactions, protein thermal motions facilitate the conversion of ground-state enzyme–substrate complexes to tunneling-ready configurations and are thus important for transferring energy from the solvent to the active site for the activation of catalysis. In this report, we employed temperature-dependent hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (TDHDX-MS) to identify catalytically linked, thermally activated peptides in a representative animal LOX, human epithelial 15-LOX-2. TDHDX-MS of wild-type 15-LOX-2 was compared to two active site mutations that retain structural stability but have increased activation energies (Ea) of catalysis. The Ea value of one variant, V427L, is implicated to arise from suboptimal substrate positioning by increased active-site side chain rotamer dynamics, as determined by X-ray crystallography and ensemble refinement. The resolved thermal network from the comparative Eas of TDHDX-MS between wild-type and V426A is localized along the front face of the 15-LOX-2 catalytic domain. The network contains a clustering of isoleucine, leucine, and valine side chains within the helical peptides. This thermal network of 15-LOX-2 is different in location, area, and backbone structure compared to a model plant lipoxygenase from soybean that exhibits a low Ea value of catalysis compared to the human ortholog. The presented data provide insights into the divergence of thermally activated protein motions in plant and animal LOXs and their relationships to the enthalpic barriers for facilitating hydrogen tunneling.

Catalytic isomerization of alkenes is a powerful tool for the construction of complex synthetically valuable molecules due to their redox-neutral, atom- and step-economical nature. However, traditional catalytic asymmetric isomerization of alkenes typically required the use of a heteroatomic group such as OH or NR2 as the thermodynamic driving force (i.e., the C═C double bond isomerizes along the direction of heteroatomic groups). Here, we present a contra-thermodynamic isomerization/asymmetric hydroboration of alkenyl alcohols and amines, in which the C═C double bond isomerizes along the opposite direction of OR and NR2. Compared to the traditional thermal isomerizations, this reaction overcomes the unfavorable thermodynamic bias to form a contra-thermodynamic alkene intermediate, followed by an irreversible asymmetric terminal hydroboration to provide highly synthetically valuable chiral 1,n-boryl ethers and amines. This protocol shows a wide substrate scope, including allylic alcohols, homoallylic alcohols, alkenyl alcohols, protected alkenyl alcohols, and various free and protected alkenyl amines. The synthetic utilities and practicability of this method were demonstrated by gram-scale reactions, diverse product transformations, and its applications in the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that this reaction involves dissociative alkene isomerization and an asymmetric hydroboration of 1,1-disubstituted alkene intermediates.

In recent years, many methods for the synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) scaffolds have been successfully established owing to their remarkable potent bioactive properties. These BCP scaffolds are typically derived from the single strain release of [1.1.1]propellane. However, approaches for dual strain release of [1.1.1]propellane remain elusive, despite the potential to create innovative opportunities for useful propellane derivatization. In this report, we present herein an efficient method for photocatalyzed dual strain release of [1.1.1]propellane with diazo compounds. Many diazo compounds, including those derived from natural products, such as (+)-borneol, estrone, vitamin E, L-menthol, metronidazole, and geraniol, can be applied to these transformations. Importantly, this method allows the cleavage and formation of multiple C–C bonds in a photocatalyzed tandem intersystem crossing (ISC)/radical ring-opening/radical–radical recombination process, and the products can be easily transformed into synthetically challenging spiro compounds, such as spiro [2.3] and spiro [3.4] compounds.

Formulating a quantitative relationship between the extent of electron transfer at metal–oxide interfaces and catalytic performance aids the rational design of oxide-supported metal catalysts. An effective strategy for monitoring electron transfer at nanoscale interfacial sites is to detect in real time the hot electrons excited when catalytic reactions occur at metal–oxide perimeter sites. Here, based on our in situ techniques for extracting electron transfer as a current signal using a catalytic nanodiode sensor, we observe hot electron excitation at the CeO2/Pt interface during H2 oxidation. By quantitatively analyzing the hot electrons released during the reaction, we identified the optimal concentration of CeO2/Pt interfaces that maximize the catalytic performance of CeO2/Pt. Through a combinatorial study of experiment and theory, we confirm the decisive role of CeO2/Pt interfacial sites in improving the reactivity and electronic excitation.

Optically pure BINOL (1,1′-bi-2-naphthol) and diversely substituted BINOLs are highly valuable chiral motifs featuring axial chirality widely applied in various fields. Although unsubstituted BINOL is commercially available, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of optically pure diversely substituted BINOLs is still very challenging. Herein, we report the development of a highly enantioselective dinuclear copper catalyst for oxidative homo- and cross-coupling of a variety of 2-naphthols to provide access to a broad range of highly valuable diversely substituted C2- and C1-symmetric BINOLs in up to 92% yield with high enantioselectivities (up to 99.5:0.5 er).

In the context of achieving carbon neutrality, converting lignin-derived molecules into high-value products through photocatalytic technology provides an environmentally friendly pathway. Establishing energy-efficient processes for converting lignin derivatives requires the construction of highly active and selective photocatalysts. However, enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of photocatalysts for lignin degradation poses an ongoing challenge due to discrepancies in the redox potential and the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. To address these significant obstacles, we devised an innovative strategy by developing a Ce2S3 nanoparticle-anchored TiO2 nanorod (Ce2S3/TiO2). This advanced photocatalyst with the S-scheme heterojunction, enabling simultaneous control of carrier dynamics and band structure, was used to study the photocatalytic degradation of the lignin model compound 2-phenoxy-1-acetophenone. Moreover, the photocatalyst can cleave the Cβ-O-4 bond selectively to convert the lignin model compound 2-phenoxy-1-acetophenone into phenol and acetophenone under visible-light irradiation. The yields are up to 94 and 80%, respectively, and 94 or 1.4 times greater than those obtained by pure TiO2 or Ce2S3 individually. In addition, our study for the increased activity in Ce2S3/TiO2 based on density functional theory calculations emphasizes the pivotal role of the S-scheme heterojunction generated between Ce2S3 and TiO2. This heterojunction significantly enhances carrier separation efficiency, thereby augmenting the efficacy of the photocatalytic process. The findings furnish valuable insights for developing advanced photocatalytic systems tailored to the efficient depolymerization of Cβ-O-4 bonds in lignin.

Chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) are among the most frequently used organocatalysts, with an ever-increasing number of applications. However, these catalysts are only obtained in a multistep synthesis and are poorly recyclable, which significantly deteriorates their environmental and economic performance. We herein report a conceptually different, general strategy for the direct immobilization of CPAs on a broad scope of solid supports including silica, polystyrene, and aluminum oxide. Solid-state catalysts were obtained in high yields and thoroughly characterized with elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), nitrogen sorption measurements, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning transmission electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDX) images, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Further, the immobilized catalysts were applied to a variety of synthetically valuable, highly stereoselective transformations under batch and flow conditions including transfer hydrogenations, a Friedländer condensation/transfer hydrogenation sequence, and Mannich reactions under cryogenic flow conditions. Generally, high yields and stereoselectivities were observed along with robust catalyst stability and reusability. After being used for 10 runs under batch conditions, no loss of selectivity or catalytic activity was observed. Under continuous-flow conditions, the heterogeneous system was in operation for 19 h and the high enantioselectivity remained unchanged throughout the entire process. We expect our approach to extend the applicability of CPAs to a higher level, with a focus on flow chemistry and a more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient use of these powerful catalysts.

A method for modeling high oxidation state catalysts is used on precatalysts with unsymmetrical and symmetrical bidentate ligands to get a more detailed understanding of how changes to ancillary ligands affect the hydroamination of alkynes catalyzed by titanium. To model the electronic donor ability, the ligand donor parameter (LDP) was used, and to model the steric effects, percent buried volume (% Vbur) was employed. For the modeling study, 7 previously unpublished unsymmetrical Ti(XX′)(NMe2)2 precatalysts were prepared, where XX′ is a chelating ligand with pyrrolyl/indolyl linkages. The rates of these unsymmetrical and 10 previously reported symmetrical precatalysts were used with the model kobs = a + b(LDP)1 + c(LDP)2 + d(% Vbur)1 + e(% Vbur)2, where a–e were found through least-squares refinement. The model suggests that (1) the two attachment points of the bidentate ligand XX′ are in different environments on the metal (e.g., axial and equatorial in a trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal structure), (2) the position of the unsymmetrical ligand on the metal is determined by the electronics of the ligand rather than the sterics, and (3) that one side of the chelating ligand's electronics strongly influences the rate, while the other side's sterics more strongly influences the rate. From these studies, we were able to generate catalysts fitting to this model with rate constants larger than the fastest symmetrical catalyst tested.

The development of benzylic C(sp3)–H functionalization methods for the assembly of benzylic derivatives has been extensively explored in recent years. However, the engagement of benzylic carbon and its adjacent C=C bond as a C3 synthon in the cycloaddition reaction via direct benzylic C–H activation is rare. Herein, we report a copper-catalyzed [3+3] radical cycloaddition reaction through benzylic C–H bond functionalization to construct six-membered cyclohexane-type rings. In this reaction, the 2-benzylic C–H bond of an indole is selectively activated and the indole serves as a C3 synthon that reacts through highly chemoselective intermolecular self-[3+3] and cross-[3+3] cycloaddition pathways. Multiple symmetric and nonsymmetric polycyclic hexahydrocarbazole scaffolds with hexacyclic 6/5/5/6/5/5/6 and pentacyclic 6/5/5/6/5/6 ring systems are synthesized with high efficiency and chemoselectivity using this strategy. Inspired by the unique radical addition pathway of cross-[3+3] cycloaddition, a highly controllable benzylic C–H functionalization for the construction of C3a-alkylated pyrroloindolines was also developed.

While transition-metal catalysts have shown the ability to regulate the Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov regioselective hydrosilylation of aryl alkenes, the selective control of anti-Markovnikov hydrosilylation of aryl alkenes is still a huge challenge in rare-earth catalyst systems. In this study, we report the rare-earth-catalyzed regiodivergent hydrosilylation of aryl alkenes. Specifically, we achieved the highly regioselective anti-Markovnikov hydrosilylation of aryl alkenes with a scandium alkyl complex Cp*AmtBuScCH2SiMe3 (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, AmtBu = tBuNC(Me)NtBu, tBu = t-butyl) as a catalyst. Two key intermediates, e.g., the scandium hydride and scandium phenethyl complex for anti-Markovnikov hydrosilylation, were characterized. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we successfully achieved the selective inversion of aryl alkenes in Markovnikov hydrosilylation using a neodymium halide complex [Cp*AmiPrNdCl]2 (AmiPr = iPrNC(Me)NiPr, iPr = isopropyl) with the larger ion radius and reduced steric hindrance in conjunction with LiCH2SiMe3. Interestingly, our study has demonstrated the significant influence of gradually increasing rare-earth ion radii on controlling the increasing Markovnikov selectivity of hydrosilylation reactions, possibly due to the enlargement of the coordination space around rare-earth metal ions. Furthermore, through a comparison of computational and experimental data, we have observed a high level of consistency, reaffirming the potential of using calculations to predict experimental outcomes and providing researchers with valuable insights.

Electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation in acid offers a promising alternative to the kinetically sluggish water oxidation reaction toward low-energy H2 generation. However, electrocatalysts driving active and selective acidic alcohol electrochemical transformation are still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate efficient alcohol-to-aldehyde conversion achieved by reticular chemistry-based modification of the catalyst's immediate environment. Specifically, coating a Bi-based electrocatalyst with a thin layer of metal–organic framework (MOF) substantially improves its performance toward benzyl alcohol electro-oxidation to benzaldehyde in a 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Detailed analysis reveals that the MOF adlayer influences catalysis by increasing the reactivity of surface hydroxides as well as weakening the catalyst-benzaldehyde binding strength. In turn, low-potential (0.65 V) cathodic H2 evolution was obtained through coupling it with anodic benzyl alcohol electro-oxidation. Consequently, the presented approach could be implemented in a wide range of electrocatalytic oxidation reactions for energy-conversion application.

Exsolved Ni–Fe alloy perovskite catalysts exhibit remarkable coking resistance during C–H and C–O activation. However, metallic utilization is typically incomplete, resulting in relatively low catalytic activity. Herein, we investigated minimal doping with Rh to boost the catalytic activity in the dry reforming of methane by promoting exsolution and enlargement of the three-phase boundary between the alloy, support, and reactants. The Rh influences the formation of the Ni–Fe alloy, as revealed by X-ray diffraction, and promotes the individual and collective CH4 and CO2 conversions, as revealed by packed bed reactor runs, temperature-programmed surface reactions, and in situ infrared spectroscopy. A minimal 0.21 wt % Rh addition enlarges the three-phase boundary while improving oxygen mobility and storage. The oxygen mobility is responsible for promoting CH4 dissociation and dynamic removal of carbon-containing intermediates, such that the catalyst remains stable for over 100 h under both 1 and 14 bar.

The encapsulation phenomenon associated with a strong metal–support interactions (SMSI) has been largely restricted to catalyst systems consisting of group VIII metals with high surface energy and reducible transition metal oxide supports with low surface energy. Here, we demonstrate an encapsulation phenomenon that, while sharing morphological similarities with conventional SMSI, follows a distinctive pathway. This is shown by the encapsulation of CuAu nanoparticles (NPs) supported on a highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Through dynamic monitoring of Cu, Au, and Cu50Au50 NPs in an oxidizing atmosphere using ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we show that this spontaneous encapsulation is achieved through the synergistic effect of the alloying elements. Specifically, the surface segregation of Cu promotes dissociative O2 adsorption, leading to the formation of atomic O species, while the subsurface enrichment of Au hinders O incorporation of oxygen into the bulk of CuAu NPs. Consequently, O spillover onto the graphite support occurs, resulting in the oxidation of the HOPG surface into graphitic oxide species. The higher affinity of the graphitic oxide species toward the Cu-segregated surface prompts their migration from the HOPG support to encapsulate the CuAu NPs. These results transcend the conventional SMSI and bear practical implications for the design and development of heterogeneous catalysts, particularly in carbon-supported alloy systems.

The anticipated shortage of an increasing number of critical elements, especially metals, requires a shift toward molecularly defined materials with low metal loadings. More particularly, surface-anchored molecular catalysts are attractive to prospectively enable cost-effective electrochemical hydrogen evolution. However, the design of ligands integrating specific anchoring unit(s) for the immobilization of molecular catalysts can be challenging and has direct consequences for the intrinsic properties of the grafted complex. In this work, two cobalt tetraazamacrocyclic complexes bearing pyrene anchoring groups at different positions on the macrocyclic ligands were synthesized. The pyrene unit allows for simple immobilization and electrochemical characterization of the two complexes on multi-walled carbon nanotube-based electrodes. Thorough electrochemical and electrocatalytic investigation demonstrates important differences between the two closely related catalysts in terms of catalyst loading, catalytic response, and stability over time, with a significantly higher stability observed at pH 7 than at pH 2.

Zeolite catalysts exhibit microporous structures, akin to the pockets in naturally occurring enzyme catalysts, which enable the confinement of reaction intermediates, thus facilitating chemical transformations. Nonetheless, the micropores also influence the formation of coke species, which is the main source of catalytic activity loss. Unveiling the relationships between the micropore topology and the internal structure and location of deactivating coke compounds is of high relevance for comprehending the deactivation mechanisms. In this study, we used an approach exploiting powder neutron diffraction to assess the location of coke and determine the dominating structures in the topologically distinct ZSM-5 (MFI topology), ZSM-35 (FER), and SSZ-13 (CHA) zeolite catalysts deactivated in industrially relevant methanol-to-hydrocarbon (MTH) conversion. In ZSM-5 and ZSM-35 catalysts, coke resides along the straight 10-membered ring (MR) channels and exhibits the highest concentration in their intersecting regions with sinusoidal 10 MR and straight 8 MR pores, respectively. In the SSZ-13 catalyst, coke is not only located in cages but also protrudes through their 8 MR windows, suggesting the interconnectivity of coke molecules between the large cavities. Notably, the coke-associated signals in the ZSM-5 and ZSM-35 catalysts show a strong planar arrangement that can be fitted by polycyclic and monocyclic arene structures, respectively. These averaged coke structures are consistent with the composition of coke assessed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, 13C and two-dimensional 1H double-quantum single-quantum magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and operando diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible spectroscopic analysis. The findings evidence that the pore topology directs the confinement and structure of coke, wherein the largest void zones of the micropore space are the most susceptible to coking.

Nitrogenated heterocycles comprise the cores of a number of synthetically useful compounds, including pharmaceuticals, bioactive natural products, agrochemicals, and other drug-like molecules. The widespread interest in methods to increase the fraction of sp3 carbon atoms (Fsp3) of drug-like scaffolds in a stereocontrolled manner, while enabling explorations of unusual amine chemical space, inspired our efforts to tune the reactivity of aziridinium ylides. A sequential nitrene–carbene transfer of simple allenes leads to divergent product outcomes depending on the nature of the carbene precursor, furnishing products of different ring sizes. In addition, the catalyst control over the ring size via proposed hydrogen-bonding interactions between the catalyst and substrate was explored. Computational studies were employed to gain insight into the major features of substrates and catalysts that influence the tunable reactivity of aziridinium ylide intermediates formed in this chemistry.

Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynols to alkenols under ambient conditions using H2O as a hydrogen source is highly attractive in synthetic chemistry. However, it is still challenging to achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) in a wide potential window. Herein, we reported a bimetallic Cu3Au alloy as an efficient catalyst for electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynols to alkenols. Specifically, during semihydrogenation of 2-butyne-1,4-diol (BYD) to 2-butene-1,4-diol (BED), the Cu3Au catalyst achieves 12.6-fold greater reaction rate and higher FE compared with pure Cu (99 vs 63%). Moreover, the Cu3Au maintains >96% FEs in a wide potential window from −0.19 to −0.59 V vs RHE. We demonstrate that the competitive adsorptions of reactive hydrogen (H*) and BYD greatly influence the semihydrogenation processes. The presence of Au in Cu3Au facilitates H* formation and reduces BYD adsorption on Cu, thus enhancing the BYD hydrogenation performance. The Cu3Au catalyst affords a broad substrate scope from alkynols to aromatic alkynes, producing the corresponding alkenes in good selectivities. Finally, we coupled BYD semihydrogenation with glycerol oxidation to replace oxygen evolution reaction in a two-electrode system, showing 40% energy saving at 200 mA for BED production and coproduction of valuable formate at the anode, demonstrating an economical manner.

Photocatalytic dinitrogen (N2) fixation is regarded as an achievable technology for ammonia (NH3) production. However, the poor separation efficiency of the photoinduced carriers and ineffective N2 activation remain grand obstacles to high-performance NH3 photosynthesis. Designing advanced heterostructured systems to accelerate charge separation and activate the N2 molecule is a feasible strategy to optimize the photocatalytic N2 fixation activity. Herein, a direct Z-scheme configuration is established between BiOBr and Bi4O5Br2 through a facile one-step solvothermal reaction. This configuration enables effective spatial separation of electron–hole pairs and preserves the robust redox ability of carriers, concurrently promoting N≡N bond activation and diminishing the energy barrier for the rate-determining step. The formation of direct Z-scheme BiOBr/Bi4O5Br2 heterojunctions is mostly attributed to the similarities in their lattice structures and crystal growth conditions. As a result, the direct Z-scheme BiOBr/Bi4O5Br2 heterojunction exhibits a high NH3 yield of 66.87 μmol g–1 h–1 without using sacrificing reagents, surpassing that of the pristine BiOBr and Bi4O5Br2 by approximately 3.3 and 5.6 times, respectively. This study provides an achievable approach to construct direct Z-scheme heterojunction systems for implementing high-performance N2 fixation under mild conditions.
