Anthraquinone derivatives are classes of compounds employed in the production of valuable materials. Leuco-quinizarin, the 2-electron-reduced form of quinizarin (1,4-dihydroxy-anthraquinone), is a highly active and useful reactant for the synthesis of variety of anthraquinone derivatives. However, conventional methods of leuco-quinizarin synthesis require stoichiometric amounts of inorganic reductants and acids or bases. We developed Pt/DMPSi-Al2O3 and Pt-Ni/DMPSi-Al2O3 as highly active and selective heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of quinizarins to leuco-quinizarins under neutral and continuous-flow conditions. Remarkably, bimetallic effects of Ni and Pt nanoparticle systems were highlighted in the selective hydrogenation of the substituted quinizarin. In addition, the continuous-flow synthesis of leuco-quinizarin and its derivatization reaction were integrated to be a fully continuous process using flow-batch-separator unified reactors.

The CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2–ODHP) is a highly important reaction for not only producing large amounts of propylene but also consuming the CO2 resource. GaN/zeolite catalysts deliver preferable activity in the reaction. However, similar to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, there are shortcomings such as poor stability and coke accumulation, especially when operated at temperatures higher than 550 °C. Generally, carbon deposition is one of the main reasons for catalyst deactivation. The limited mass transfer greatly aggravates the deposited carbon formation, since carbon precursors could not be removed in time. In the present work, we modified zeolites with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores, which could offer a shorter diffusion distance and pore-rich structure to enhance the mass transfer. Thanks to this enhancement, the catalyst offers an initial propane conversion of 68.0% with a yield of 39.4% to propylene, surpassing other reported GaN/zeolite catalysts to data. Importantly, the catalyst showed a low loss rate of activity and a low amount of deposited carbon, which was easily regenerated compared with those of other catalysts without a short b-axis or hierarchical pores. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirmed that the reaction involves a coupling reaction of direct dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction via reverse water–gas shift reaction, and CO2 participates in the reaction. The present work sheds light on designing an efficient catalyst for CO2–ODHP via a mass transfer-boosted strategy and, importantly, is expected to provide inspiration in constructing a zeolite with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores.

A kinetic and mechanistic study of direct catalytic nitrilation from methyl salicylate and ammonia is conducted by using an amphoteric ZnAl2O4 spinel as a model catalyst. This overall process integrates the catalytic ammonolysis of esters with the dehydration of amides, proceeding stepwise over the concerted Lewis acid–base pairs of Zn–O–Al linkages. The chemisorption and activation of C–O bonds of the ester over Lewis acid–base pairs facilitate the leaving of the methoxy group, while Lewis basic oxygen (Zn–O*–Al) serves as the main hub station for multistep proton transportation, thus leading to the decreased apparent activation energy of nitrilation and ammonolysis. The combined experimental and computational evidence confirms that this direct nitrilation process follows a monomolecular surface adsorption model, i.e., the Eley–Rideal mechanism, involving eight elementary reaction steps in which chemisorbed surface species of methyl salicylate react with gaseous NH3 molecules via nucleophilic addition–elimination and multistep proton transfer to generate amides and nitriles in sequence. Microkinetic model discrimination and DFT calculations reveal that the formation of chemisorbed imine (C═N–H) via proton transfer from the Lewis basic oxygen atom (Zn–O*–Al) to the carbonyl oxygen (C═O*) is the rate-determining step, thereby providing a potential consideration of protonation and deprotonation ability to rationally design an improved catalyst.

l-Threonine transaldolase (LTTA) is an attractive biocatalyst because of its potential diastereoselectivity in the synthesis of β-hydroxy-α-amino acids (βHAAs). However, prospective development of LTTA has been hampered by its low activity. Here, a combination of techniques involving structural comparison, computational analysis, Loop deletion, and alanine scanning was used to identify a key Loop region (Loop 1) regulating the catalytic ability of Chitiniphilus shinanonensis LTTA (CsLTTA). Saturation mutagenesis and iterative saturation mutagenesis at the hot spots in Loop 1 were performed, and the best variant containing an F70T/C57Q/Y69T (TQT) triple mutation was screened. The diastereoisomer excess (de) produced by the TQT variant (95.4%syn) was greater than that produced by the wild-type (WT) enzyme (75.2%syn), and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the TQT variant was four times higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations, metadynamics simulations, and CAVER analysis revealed the critical role of the Loop 1 structure in regulating the hydrogen bond network and thus reshaping the active-site pocket to control the syn-tunnel direction. Further engineering of Loop 1 in ObiH, an LTTA responsible for obafluorin biosynthesis, resulted in the development of the F70T-C57Q-H69T (ObiH-TQT) variant producing a de of 97%syn. Using the ObiH-TQT variant for kilogram-scale synthesis of l-syn-p-methylsulfonylphenylserine, coupled with acetaldehyde elimination, resulted in space–time yields of up to 12.7 g L–1 h–1. The method achieved 98.3% substrate conversion and 99.2%syn de within 6 h, marking the highest reported levels to date. The above findings will contribute to the industrial production of β-hydroxy-α-amino acids, offer insights into the mechanism of Loop regions regulating the catalytic function of LTTAs, and provide ideas for engineering other enzymes.

The direct oxidation of methane into ethanol with high productivity under mild conditions is a grand challenge. We report the development of mixed cerium/zirconium metal–organic framework (MOF) nodes-supported mononuclear nickel(II)-hydroxyl species [Cex/Zry–UiO–Ni(OH)] as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for direct transformation of methane into ethanol. The Ni2+ ion in Cex/Zry–UiO–Ni(OH) MOFs coordinates with a μ4–O–, one hydroxy group, and two neutral carboxylate oxygens, which are directly bonded to the Ce4+ ion at the mixed metal-oxo nodes. The spectroscopic and control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the precise composition of the mixed-metal node, the isolation of mono Ni-hydroxyl species at the node, and the cooperative Ni–Ce active sites confined within the porous UiO-MOFs promote the facile C–H activation of methane at 80 °C, leading to the formation of •CH3 radicals and subsequent C–C coupling within the pores to produce ethanol in an extraordinarily high yield of 6521 mmol gNi–1 with >93% selectivity, outperforming most of the current reports. Our mechanistic investigation suggests that the direct methane oxidation into ethanol proceeds via a dual catalytic cycle, in which the doping of Ce4+ ion within MOF's node and the proximity between Ce4+ and Ni2+ ions lead to the reversible Ce–Ocarboxylate bond dissociation and Ni–(μ2–OH)–Ce bond formation, which is the key for efficient formation of •CH3 radical in the turnover limiting step. This work highlights the importance of mixed metal-MOFs in designing well-defined heterobimetallic-supported catalysts for the valorization of methane and light alkanes via cooperative catalysis.

High-temperature sintering is critical for efficient hematite photoanodes in terms of improving the crystallinity and minimizing deficiencies. However, prolonged conventional furnace annealing requires high energy consumption and simultaneously results in serious damage to the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate. This work demonstrates a universal wet-interfacial Joule heating strategy for rapidly synthesizing high-performance metastable protohematite photoanodes, which greatly decreases the power consumption and causes less damage to the TCO substrate by shortening the sintering time to ∼90 s. More importantly, the protohematite phase was found to effectively facilitate the charge dynamics in the bulk and surface of the as-resulting photoanode by increasing donor density and lowering the oxygen evolution reaction overpotential via offering dual active sites (lattice oxygen and Fe sites). Moreover, this annealing strategy could be well coupled with commonly used Ti-treatment to achieve a further performance enhancement and also shows high feasibility in rapidly fabricating efficient TiO2 and BiVO4 photoanodes. This study opens a facile, rapid, and reliable approach for fabricating efficient metal oxide photoanodes, contributing to the development of photoelectrochemical water splitting.
