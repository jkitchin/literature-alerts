Immobilizing molecular catalysts on surfaces introduces spatial control of catalysis and promises improved stability and recyclability of the catalyst. The interplays between the support and the immobilized molecular species, however, remain underexplored. Using Ni as a prototypical support, here we report a study on how the electronic interactions between the support and the molecular catalyst impacts the reactivity. This work was built upon our previous successes in switching the reactivity of iron bis(iminopyridine) alkoxide complexes through redox toggling, where the anchored iron(II) complex polymerizes lactide, and its cationic iron(III) counterpart polymerizes epoxides. It was found that Ni as a metal support could readily oxidize the complex to exhibit catalytic activity toward epoxide polymerization. The charge transfer between Ni and the Fe complex could be modulated by either electrochemical reduction or adding a layer of TiO2. The results are expected to have major implications for research efforts aimed at converging homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

We present an automated method, gas–solid nanoreactor molecular dynamics (GS-NMD), designed to explore reaction space and construct reaction networks for complex gas–solid heterogeneous catalysis systems by integrating multiple acceleration techniques. Periodic pulses were used to drive gas-phase molecules toward the catalyst surface, accelerating adsorption and Eley–Rideal reactions. Adsorbed species were then subjected to metadynamics to overcome reaction barriers associated with migration, Langmuir–Hinshelwood-type reactions, and desorption, using the root-mean-square deviations in Cartesian space as collective variables. We demonstrate the efficiency of GS-NMD with the case of N2 dissociation on Fe surfaces, showing its ability to effectively screen for low-barrier reactions within a vast reaction space and distinct catalysts of different performances. Additionally, we illustrate the method's utility in constructing effective reaction networks for heterogeneous catalysis, exemplified by ammonia synthesis, which comprises only low-barrier elementary steps. These results suggest that GS-NMD is a promising and efficient tool for the automated exploration of heterogeneous catalysis, enabling the identification of the most favorable mechanisms and active sites for gas–solid reactions.

We herein develop an innovative approach for the decarbonylative silylation using a molecular [Ru(dcbpy)(bpy)2]2+ (dcbpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid; bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) incorporated UiO-67 metal–organic framework (MOFs) (denoted as UiO-67-Ru) as a powerful heterogeneous catalyst, which is then applied in the reaction of abundantly available cinnamaldehydes with silanes under photothermal condition. Mechanistic studies reveal that the silane can be absorbed and activated within the cavities of the framework, leading to the generation of a silyl radical. The silyl radical plays a key role in the decarbonylative silylation process and further goes through oxidative silylation with cinnamaldehydes to generate the corresponding alkenyl silanes. This work not only develops a strategy for the preparation of alkenyl silane from highly abundant cinnamaldehyde and silanes but also affords useful inspiration on the rational design of MOFs materials for the decarbonylative silylation.    

    

## Shallow Rate-Redox Potential Scaling in Aqueous Molecular Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis Across a Family of Iron Macrocycles

Rate-overpotential scaling relationships have been employed widely to understand trends in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis by dissolved metal macrocycles in organic electrolytes. Similar scaling relationships remain unknown for surface-adsorbed ORR electrocatalysts in the acidic aqueous environments germane to proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Herein, we examine ORR catalysis in aqueous perchloric acid media for a structurally diverse array of iron macrocycle complexes adsorbed on Vulcan carbon black. The macrocycles encompass Fe–N4, Fe–N2N′2 and Fe–NxC4–x motifs bearing pyrrolic, pyridinic, and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) moieties in the primary ligation sphere, giving rise to a 670 mV range in Fe(III/II) redox potentials, EFe(III/II). Experimental Tafel data in the micropolarization regime were extrapolated to the EFe(III/II) to furnish estimated per-site-normalized current density (jper-site) values that span ∼4.6 orders of magnitude across the family of compounds. Despite the structural diversity of this family of compounds, extrapolated jper-site values correlate with the Fe(III/II) redox potentials in a roughly log-linear fashion with a shallow scaling factor of approximately 145 mV/decade. These findings highlight the phenomenology that negative shifts in EFe(III/II) track with diminishing returns in catalytic rate promotion, regardless of the exact ORR mechanism, and suggest that changes to the primary ligating environment in a macrocycle are insufficient to break fundamental rate-potential scaling relationships in aqueous ORR catalysis. Together these studies motivate the further development of higher-potential iron complexes that employ motifs beyond the equatorial ligation plane to enhance ORR catalysis.

## Ag-Regulated Interfacial Electron Transfer between TiO2 and MoSx for Enhanced H2O2 Production

The electronic configuration mismatch between the TiO2 support and the MoSx cocatalyst induces spontaneous free-electron transfer in an unfavorable direction, resulting in stronger O2 adsorption on Mo active sites and causing limited H2O2 production. Herein, we propose a strategy for directional free-electron transfer to produce electron-enriched Mo(4 – δ)+ sites via introducing an Ag mediator into the TiO2/MoSx photocatalyst, which aims to weaken O2 adsorption for improving H2O2 production activity. To achieve this, a core–shell Ag@MoSx cocatalyst was ingeniously constructed on the TiO2 surface to synthesize the TiO2/Ag@MoSx photocatalyst. The resultant TiO2/Ag@MoSx achieves a significantly enhanced H2O2 production rate of 16.13 mmol g–1 h–1 with an AQY value of 8.79%, surpassing TiO2/Ag and TiO2/MoSx by 10.0 and 237.2 times, respectively. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the incorporation of the Ag mediator into the TiO2/Ag@MoSx system can facilitate directional free-electron transfer to the MoSx cocatalyst. This causes the creation of electron-enriched Mo(4 – δ)+ sites and an increase in the antibonding-orbital occupancy of Mo–Oads, ultimately weakening the Mo–Oads bond and enabling high activity in H2O2 production. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing reactant adsorption for efficient artificial photosynthesis.

Herein, we describe a photoinduced multicomponent catalytic carboxylation protocol that streamlines the access to 13C-labeled carboxylic acids from simple olefin precursors, sulfinate salts and 13CO2. Site selectivity is dictated by the radical philicity of the starting precursors and reaction intermediates, resulting in either a four-component or a five-component endeavor. The method is characterized by its simplicity and flexibility across a wide number of coupling counterparts

Synthetic photobiocatalysts are promising catalysts for valuable chemical transformations by harnessing solar energy inspired by natural photosynthesis. However, the synergistic integration of all of the components for efficient light harvesting, cascade electron transfer, and efficient biocatalytic reactions presents a formidable challenge. In particular, replicating intricate multiscale hierarchical assembly and functional segregation involved in natural photosystems, such as photosystems I and II, remains particularly demanding within artificial structures. Here, we report the bottom-up construction of a visible-light-driven chemical–biological hybrid nanoreactor with augmented photocatalytic efficiency by anchoring an α-carboxysome shell encasing [FeFe]-hydrogenases (H–S) on the surface of a hydrogen-bonded organic molecular crystal, a microporous α-polymorph of 1,3,6,8-tetra(4′-carboxyphenyl)pyrene (TBAP-α). The self-association of this chemical–biological hybrid system is facilitated by hydrogen bonds, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. Within this hybrid photobiocatalyst, TBAP-α functions as an antenna for visible-light absorption and exciton generation, supplying electrons for sacrificial hydrogen production by H–S in aqueous solutions. This coordination allows the hybrid nanoreactor, H–S|TBAP-α, to execute hydrogen evolution exclusively driven by light irradiation with a rate comparable to that of photocatalyst-loaded precious cocatalyst. The established approach to constructing new light-driven biocatalysts combines the synergistic power of biological nanotechnology with the multilength-scale structure and functional control offered by supramolecular organic semiconductors. It opens up innovative opportunities for the fabrication of biomimetic nanoreactors for sustainable fuel production and enzymatic reactions.

Activating the C–H bond in methane represents a cornerstone challenge in catalytic research. While several supported metal oxide nanoclusters (MeO-NCs) have shown promise for this reaction, their optimal composition remains underexplored primarily due to the large number of possible compositions and their amorphous nature. This study addresses these challenges using computational approaches. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we began with a previously studied supported tetra-copper oxide nanocluster and systematically substituted its Cu sites with first-row transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn). This process allowed us to examine the catalytic activity of 162 MeO-NCs with a variety of geometric and electronic structures, leading to 12 new compositions that outperformed the base nanocluster. Exploring the structure–activity relationships with machine learning, our analysis uncovered correlations between the intrinsic electronic and structural properties of the nanoclusters and the free energy barriers for methane activation despite the challenges posed by the structural flexibility of these amorphous nanoclusters. The results offer insights into the optimization of MeO-NCs for methane activation. Additionally, we developed a clustering model capable of distinguishing high-performing nanoclusters from less effective ones with strong tolerance to the interference from the structural flexibility of these amorphous nanoclusters. These findings help narrow down the material design space for more time-consuming high-level quantum chemical calculations, offering a promising pathway toward advancing eco-friendly methane conversion.

Chiral 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidines are ubiquitous subunits in natural products, bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals, and chiral catalysts. However, their asymmetric synthesis still presents a formidable challenge. We herein report a rare example of diastereodivergent parallel kinetic resolution of racemic 2-substituted pyrrolidines via C(sp3)–H borylation. A vast array of enantioenriched cis- and trans-2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidines were obtained with high enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility was demonstrated by downstream transformations, including the synthesis of optically active pyrrolidine 197B and cis-pyrrolidine 225H.
