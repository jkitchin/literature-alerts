Carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bond formation mediated by transition metals is a powerful and convenient methodology for organic synthesis. To effectively meet the demands of catalyst design, an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms and pathways of active species evolution is essential. Advances in electron microscopy now offer unprecedented multilevel visualization of liquid-phase chemical systems, providing a powerful tool for mechanistic studies. In this work, we found that the use of either nickel- or copper-based catalyst precursors with preinstalled thiolate groups in combination with pyridinium ionic liquid as the reaction medium leads to a positive synergistic effect, resulting in the formation of transition metal species with high catalytic activity in the C–S cross-coupling reaction between aryl halides and thiols or disulfides. Through multiscale in situ and operando electron microscopy in the liquid phase, we elucidated the self-adjustment of the catalytic system and revealed the simultaneous emergence of metallic nanoparticles and corresponding thiolate species, leading to the independent activation of the C- and S-substrates and the subsequent elimination of the product via organic group metathesis. The proposed methodology for the catalytic preparation of aromatic organosulfides was used for the design of synthetic routes to pharmacologically important substances.

Electrochemically driven carbon–carbon coupling utilizing renewable electricity under ambient conditions has emerged as an innovative approach for synthesizing high-value chemicals, which still faces inherent challenges such as low conversion rates and poor selectivity. While electroreducing furfural to hydrofuroin can produce high-quality biofuel, its efficiency need to be promoted. Herein, Cu–Sn bimetallic catalyst has been developed with a conversion rate of furfural of >97% and hydrofuroin selectivity of >67% through equilibrium of the interfacial intermediate *H and *fur-CHOH, which exhibits the greatest state-of-the-art overall performance. Characterization and theoretical calculation reveal that Cu serves as the active site for generating *fur-CHOH, whose electron density can be decreased by introducing Sn, and results in a higher *fur-CHOH coverage and a lower energy barrier of dimerization. Moreover, adding Sn also enables sluggish *H formation to balance interfacial *fur-CHOH and *H, leading to reduced hydrogenation byproducts. The as-developed approach provides valuable insights for optimizing other C–C electrocoupling reactions for the synthesis of high-value chemicals.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkane with CO2 as the oxidant has attracted worldwide attention as a promising approach for simultaneously producing valuable alkenes and greenhouse gas utilization. The selectivity and yield of the produced alkene, nevertheless, require further enhancement for practical applications. In this work, taking Sr2Ti0.8Co0.6Fe0.6O6-δ (STCF) as the electrode material, we demonstrate that a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) can efficiently catalyze the ODH of ethane to ethylene on the anode and reduce CO2 to CO at the cathode. The optimal yield of ethylene reached 66.3% at 800 °C, which is among the highest values reported in the literature. Such ethane ODH activity is attributed to the activation of surface oxygen on the STCF anode by electrolytic voltage, as revealed experimentally by advanced spectroscopic techniques. The density functional theory calculation further implied that the electrochemically driven formation of active oxygen species on the STCF surface upshifts the O 2p-band center, facilitates electron transfer, and enhances surface adsorption, leading to a strongly promoted dehydrogenation process. The results clarify the critical role of oxygen activity in determining the electrochemical ODH performance and can guide the rational design of catalysts for other electrosynthesis processes.

The regeneration of NAD(P)H and its analogues is crucial for biocatalytic processes. However, despite the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis in regenerating NAD(P)H, the sustainability of enzymes is often compromised, particularly under extreme catalytic conditions. Moreover, artificial cofactors may present advantages in certain reactions due to their stability and versatility, yet the substrate specificity of enzymes poses significant challenges to their regeneration through the enzymatic method. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a highly stable regeneration method that can be adapted to both natural and artificial cofactors. In this work, employing potassium-ion-doped carbon nitride (ionCN-0.2) as a catalyst not only achieves high-efficiency photocatalytic regeneration of NAD(P)H, comparable to that of glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), but also a remarkable ability to regenerate nicotinamide analogues. This enhanced performance stems from the tunable negative ζ-potential, which effectively adsorbs the positively charged [Cp*Rh(bpy)H2O]2+ mediator, resulting in enhanced regeneration kinetics of the nicotinamide moiety. The catalyst demonstrates superior performance compared to the reported systems; the optimal regeneration rate reaches 0.55 mmol L–1 gcat–1 min–1 and approaches enzymatic regeneration efficiency. Expanding the reaction conditions to a wider temperature and pH range also confirms the effectiveness and sufficient stability of this photocatalytic system, offering a promising strategy for stable cofactor regeneration in biocatalytic processes.

The electrocatalytic transformation of waste nitrate into useful ammonia is a "one stone, two birds" strategy, which is commendatory from the viewpoint of the environment. In this vein, developing catalysts with high efficiency, selectivity, and stability is desired to make the attractive technology viable. Herein, we synthesized an economical and scalable electrocatalyst of Cu nanoparticles dispersed onto ZnO nanowire arrays (Cu@ZnO NWA) for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3–RR). This catalyst constructed on the Cu foam achieved a high ammonia yield of ∼6.03 mg cm–2 h–1, a Faradaic efficiency of ∼89.14%, and good stability for the NO3–RR in the Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with the presence of 0.05 M KNO3, superior to most Cu-based catalysts reported in the literature. According to electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations, ZnO nanowires offer stable support to accomplish uniform dispersion of Cu nanoparticles and provide a synergy to boost electrocatalytic properties of Cu catalysts. This synergistic effect may originate from the electronic localization at the interface of Cu nanoparticles and ZnO nanowires, resulting in the electron deficiency of the Cu@ZnO NWA surface. Therefore, the promotional mechanisms are associated with enhanced adsorption of the electronegative nitrate ions and boosted charge transfer during the NO3–RR process. Notably, the Cu@ZnO NWA catalyst can be synthesized on most conductor surfaces through a flexible combination of electrodeposition and hydrothermal techniques, showing good commonality and scalability, thus having a vast industrialization potential for practical application.

The catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs) is vitally determined by their coordination environments. So far, the catalytic manipulation of SACs has been mainly focused on the first and second nearest coordination structures of the center atoms. We herein demonstrate that the chemical environments beyond the second coordination shells also significantly influence the catalytic behaviors of SACs. Our findings reveal that the presence of graphitic nitrogen can induce a shift of the O2 reduction pathway on CoN4C sites from an energy-conversion favorite 4e– pathway to a H2O2-production desirable 2e– pathway. The remote graphitic N tunes the electronic structure of Co from the lower-spin state to the higher-spin state, as proved by the zero-field cooling (ZFC) temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, which weakens the adsorption of O2/*OOH, ultimately enhancing the selectivity toward H2O2. It is further revealed that the catalytic influence of graphitic N may be universally present in other SACs such as FeN4C and MnN4C. Impressively, the graphitic N-doped CoN4C exhibits a high H2O2 Faraday efficiency (82%) in a flow cell, with a remarkable H2O2 yield of 0.096 mmol cm–2 h–1 for 200 h at 0.358 V (vs RHE), which is sufficient for many applications such as the electro-Fenton-like degradation of the malachite green and demonstrated the feasibility of H2O2 electrosynthesis.
