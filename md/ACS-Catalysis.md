Sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) is a second-generation click chemistry reaction that relies on the unique reactivities of SVI–F bonds. The development of efficient methods for incorporating a S(VI)–F motif into molecules is of great significance. Sulfamoyl fluorides (R1R2NSO2F), serving as versatile SuFExable hubs, are typically synthesized by using "+SO2F" reagents to establish N-SO2F bonds. In this study, we report the development of N-fluorosulfamoyl pyridium salts (NFSAPs) as radical fluorosulfonamidation reagents that are readily accessible and bench-stable. By employing NFSAPs as essential fluorosulfamoyl radical (•NSO2F) precursors, the direct installation of the NSO2F group onto (hetero)arenes and alkenes is achieved through distinct C–N bond formation reactions. This platform facilitates the collective synthesis of highly functionalized N-aryl, N-alkyl, and N-alkenyl sulfamoyl fluorides (R1R2NSO2F) under mild photocatalytic conditions and has been applied in the late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals and peptides.

Structural metamorphosis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) eliciting highly active metal-hydroxide catalysts has come to the fore lately, with much promise. However, the role of organic ligands leaching into electrolytes during alkaline hydrolysis remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the influence of organic carboxylate anions on a family of Ni or NiFe-based hydroxide type catalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction. After excluding interfering variables, i.e., electrolyte purity, Ohmic loss, and electrolyte pH, the experimental results indicate that adding organic anions to the electrolyte profoundly impacts the redox potential of the Ni species versus with only a negligible effect on the oxygen evolution activities. In-depth studies demonstrate plausible reasons behind those observations and allude to far-reaching implications in controlling electrocatalysis in MOFs, mainly where compositional modularity entails fine-tuning organic anions.

Herein, we report a Pd/electron-transfer mediator (ETM) catalyst "Pd/Cu-UiO-67(N)x" based on defect-engineered metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibits high activity and stability in the aminoamidation reaction of N-sulfonyl-2-allyl aniline with isonitrile insertion. The Pd turnover number of the Pd/Cu-UiO-67(N)x system is about 30 times higher than that of existing catalytic systems by decreasing the loading of Pd and base. This work systematically investigates the specific effects of defects on the activation of the reactants. The rationally anchored Pd(II) and Cu(II) in the framework interact with the O2 trapped in the defective MOF to achieve reoxidation of Pd(0). This strategy not only confers high activity and stability to Pd(II) species but also provides access to the application of MOFs in large-size substrate transformations.

Photocatalytic enantioselective Giese radical addition with inert C(sp3)–H bonds represents a highly efficient and economically favorable approach to synthesizing diverse value-added chiral molecules from abundant feedstock. Herein, we disclose a quinone-initiated photocatalytic asymmetric Giese radical addition of α-substituted acrylamides with inert C(sp3)–H bonds by applying simple quinones as HAT photocatalysts in combination with a chiral N,N′-dioxide/praseodymium(III) catalyst. A wide array of ethers, thioethers, selenide, amines, and alkanes can smoothly transform into the corresponding chiral α-aryl amide derivatives with satisfactory enantioselectivities (68 examples, up to 95% ee) under mild conditions. Based on spectroscopy studies and control experiments, a quinone-initiated HAT catalytic cycle was proposed, and DFT calculations revealed that the interaction between quinone and chiral Lewis acid was essential for enantio-induction in the asymmetric back hydrogen atom transfer process.

The field of iron catalysis often faces hurdles in accommodating its transient and unstable low-valent intermediates. By harnessing the noninnocent character of commercial bathocuproine ligand, we managed to develop a reliable functionalization of alkynes with primary, secondary, and tertiary silanes but also with germanium hydrides, catalyzed by a low-valent iron complex. The robustness of the catalyst enabled gram-scale synthesis of vinylsilanes, low catalytic loading, one-pot, hetero, bis-hydrosilylation, but also high steric build-up. Mechanistic studies suggest an important effect of the MgII cation resulting from the reduction of the precatalyst, by assisting the dynamic generation of a highly reactive, under-coordinated iron species from a stable complex.

Strategies incorporating heterometals to introduce surface-active hydrogen (*H) have been extensively utilized to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts in the nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR). However, a comprehensive understanding of *H behavior and its specific impact on regulating the NitRR pathway remains elusive, particularly in a quantitative manner. In this study, we prepared a group of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as model catalysts with diverse *H concentrations and lifetimes. Our findings reveal that the NitRR activity of Cu-based LDHs is highly dependent on the *H species that could be modulated by the incorporated heterometallic sites. Specifically, we conducted in situ analysis of different Cu-based LDH catalysts using time-resolved scanning electrochemical microscopy. The surface concentration and lifetime of *H at various applied potentials were quantified, enabling us to establish the relationship between the *H behavior and NitRR performance. Therefore, optimal NitRR performance was achieved with CuNi-LDHs, exhibiting a faradaic efficiency of 94.6% and yield rate of 2.7 mg h–1 cm–2 because of its appropriate *H surface concentration and lifetime. Additionally, we observe a trend of CuNi > CuCo > Cu > CuRu > CuFe > CuMg in terms of the faradaic efficiency for NH3 production. These results suggest that by effectively utilizing the stable *H produced by the catalyst, one would allow favorable NitRR performance, offering a promising strategy for other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.

Constructing a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC)-driven overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system is a conceptual idea for hydrogen generation with theoretical zero-energy consumption, which remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a two-dimensional Ru-enriched metal–organic framework catalyst (NiRu-ABDC) is prepared via a self-sacrificing template strategy. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that Ru serves as an active site for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), endowing NiRu-ABDC∥NiRu-ABDC with outstanding OHzS performance. The DFT results further clarify that Ru incorporation facilitates electron localization and strengthens the M–O bonds in the Ni-ABDC framework, enabling the NiRu-ABDC∥NiRu-ABDC electrolyzer cell to be stable for over 100 h. Further, a self-powered hydrogen production system is constructed with anodic NiRu-ABDC, in which OHzS is successfully powered by synthesized DHzFCs, achieving hydrogen yield of 14.3 mol h–1 m–2, showing its feasibility for practical applications.

Oxidative fluorination is reported to increase methanol (MeOH) productivity of binary copper–zinc oxide (CZ) catalyst systems yet is incompatible with all the hitherto tested ternary support materials. Here, we show that the oxidative fluorination with F2 gas of CZ MeOH catalysts including iron oxide as a support material improves catalytic performances. A systematic variation of the compositions of the investigated ternary CZFe (copper, zinc, and iron) catalyst system led to a total of 13 different systems. The subsequent oxidative fluorination of all systems with a low F2 pressure of 200 mbar showed significant improvement in the MeOH productivity and selectivity for almost all systems tested. High-iron systems benefited most from oxidative fluorination. In addition, selected systems were exposed to higher F2 amounts and were studied. Further measurements showed that the crystallinity, surface area, and high-temperature carbonate content of the CZFe systems are very well tunable. Kinetic investigations indicated that fluorination leads to an increase in the number of active sites for the MeOH synthesis and at the same time increases the apparent activation energy for the RWGS reaction. In addition, oxidative fluorination at total F2 pressures of and higher than 1250 mbar shuts down the iron-induced parasitic Fischer–Tropsch-type hydrogenation to hydrocarbons and results in the highest MeOH production rates.
