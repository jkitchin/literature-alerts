The treatment of SARS-CoV-2 can be accomplished by effective suppression of its 3CL protease (3CLpro), also known as the main protease (Mpro) and nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5). Covalent inhibitors can irreversibly and selectively disable the protease, particularly when they are highly exothermic. Herein we investigated the distinct kinetic behaviors exhibited by two covalently linked SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. One of these inhibitors features a nitrile reactive group, while the other has this group replaced by an alkyne group, a less reactive electrophile. Our investigations involve the assessment of the free energy surfaces of the key feasible mechanisms: that is, direct and water-assisted mechanisms involved in the rate-determining proton-transfer nucleophilic attack step through the utilization of both ab initio and empirical valence bond (EVB) simulations. The calculated free energy profiles show that substituting the nitrile group with alkyne increases the chemical barrier but leads to very exothermic reaction energy and is an irreversible process as opposed to nitrile, which is moderately exothermic and reversible. We also examine the time dependence of IC50 inhibition by applying an innovative kinetic simulation approach, which is particularly important in studies of covalent inhibitors with a very exothermic bonding step. Our computational approach provides a good agreement between the calculated and observed values of the time dependence results for the nitrile and alkyne inhibitors. Our approach, which is rather unique in combining calculations of the chemical barriers and the binding energy is likely to be very effective in studies of the effectiveness of other covalent inhibitors related cases.

The one-pot synthesis of amines from benzyl alcohol (BA) and nitrobenzene (NB) represents a step-economic method. However, reported works typically require more than 3 equiv of BA to complete the transfer hydrogenation of NB, and few studies can achieve selective synthesis of imines and secondary amines. In our previous work, Zr(OH)4 demonstrated both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation capabilities. Building on this, another component Cu was introduced to enhance its catalytic performance for catalyzing coupling reaction between stoichiometric BA and NB under a H2 atmosphere. The physical hybrid catalyst Cu + Zr(OH)4 selectively produced imines, while the supported catalyst Cu/Zr(OH)4 yielded secondary amines. Characterization and mechanism experiments revealed that modulating the proximity between Cu and Zr(OH)4 leads to (1) different adsorption abilities of the catalyst for N-benzylideneaniline (NBA) and (2) interactions between Zr(OH)4 and Cu in close contact, which stabilized the electronic structure of Cu forming more Cu+/Cu0 ion pairs with strong H2 activation ability. This work presents a catalyst design strategy and offers an approach for the selective preparation of N-benzylideneaniline and N-benzylaniline.

Methane (CH4) activation and conversion under mild reaction conditions are a great challenge for the chemical industry. Photocatalysis is attractive for activating inert C–H bonds of CH4 at room temperature. Specifically, photocatalytic nonoxidative coupling of CH4 (NOCM) is a promising process to produce ethane (C2-hydrocarbon) and H2. Different oxide-based photocatalysts have been used for room-temperature NOCM, and TiO2 is a potential photocatalyst with a bandgap that can capture photons in the UV region. However, a fundamental understanding of the NOCM mechanism on TiO2 is still missing. Herein, we apply multiscale modeling, combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to investigate the photocatalytic NOCM on a rutile TiO2(110) surface. DFT calculations revealed that the photogenerated holes mediate the homolytic activation of CH4 via the formation of methyl radicals with an activation barrier that is 70% lower than that of the conventional thermocatalytic route. The generated methyl radicals further recombine to form ethane. The detailed reaction pathway energetics investigated with DFT-based kMC simulations revealed that ethane can be formed at 315.15 K, but the dissociated hydrogens poison the catalyst surface. Further thermocatalytic simulations revealed that increasing the temperature by thermal heating (ca. 690.15 K) facilitated H2 formation and catalyst regeneration. Importantly, we demonstrate how photo- and thermocatalytic modes can be combined, facilitating NOCM on TiO2 and a route to enable dynamic catalysis simulations through multiscale modeling, opening alternative avenues in computational catalyst discovery.

Cytochromes P450 (P450s) commonly catalyze hydroxylation but can also be responsible for dehydrogenation reactions, important in drug metabolism and biosynthesis; the mechanism of the latter transformation remains poorly understood. The well-characterized bacterial CYP199A4 catalyzes both hydroxylation and dehydrogenation of p-alkylbenzoic acids and thus provides an ideal model system in which to investigate the mechanism of P450-catalyzed aliphatic dehydrogenation. Through use of enantioselectively deuterated probes, metabolite analysis, protein crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM (ONIOM) modeling, CYP199A4-catalyzed dehydrogenation was found to be completely enantioselective and postulated to occur through an asynchronous proton coupled electron transfer. No definitive evidence of a cationic intermediate was uncovered but instead, the positioning of the substrate was postulated to be key in directing the chemoselectivity of the reaction i.e., dehydrogenation versus hydroxylation. This knowledge could be exploited to control dehydrogenation in other P450s and helps explain the common occurrence of P450-desaturated drug metabolites alongside hydroxylated ones.    

    

## A New Look at Catalyst Surfaces at Work: Introducing Mixed Isotope Operando Infrared Spectroscopy (MIOIRS)

This Perspective focuses on the characterization of supported metal catalysts by operando and CO infrared (IR) spectroscopy. CO IR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for probing catalyst surfaces and is used to identify single-atom catalysts, estimate metal surface availability to the gas phase, and measure catalyst Lewis acidity. However, the interpretation of CO IR spectra on metal surfaces is not trivial and is influenced by dipole–dipole interactions among CO molecules at medium to high coverage. Such a phenomenon results in spectral distortions, such as intensity transfer among IR bands, the appearance of spurious bands, and shifts in band position. Dipole–dipole interactions were widely investigated and understood from the 1950s to 1990s, but the implications for operando spectroscopy have been seemingly overlooked in the literature, with a few exceptions. Inspired by seminal studies in the field, I propose here the use of mixed isotopic streams, such as diluted 13CO in 12CO, to reduce dipole coupling effects and retrieve more information from operando IR spectra in reactions involving CO, such as CO oxidation or hydrogenation reactions. Similarly, mixed 13CO2/12CO2 streams may be applied in CO2 hydrogenation, where adsorbed CO is commonly observed. The proposed name of the technique is Mixed Isotope Operando IR Spectroscopy, MIOIRS. In this Perspective, I will first summarize the nature of dipole–dipole interactions in adsorbed CO layers and their effects on CO IR spectra. Then, I will briefly describe how diluted isotopic mixtures of CO can partially break the coupling among adsorbates and reduce spectral distortion. In both sections, I will give a few showcases of the implications of vibrational coupling in the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts. Finally, I will discuss the possible implications of MIOIRS for the detection and quantification of defect and surface sites on metal nanoparticles, the characterization of bimetallic nanoparticles surfaces, and the kinetics of CO intermediates adsorbed on different active sites. Notably, MIOIRS may be expanded to other reactions in which adsorbates have strong permanent dipoles, such as in self-catalytic reduction for NOx abatement.

Partial oxidation of ethylene over silver catalysts produces more than 30 million metric tons of ethylene oxide (EO) annually. However, the form of active silver surfaces, reactive oxygen species, and dominant pathways of this chemical reaction remains controversial despite decades of research. Here, we use operando Raman spectroscopy and transient kinetic measurements to demonstrate that higher coverages of peroxide species, present only upon Ag oxide surfaces that form in situ, correlate with greater selectivities to EO. Ab initio calculations reveal that the reconstructed Ag oxides preferentially stabilize diatomic oxygen species (peroxide and superoxide) under relevant conditions, and these species contribute to the selective formation of EO. The dominant reaction pathways change with surface coverages; however, bound O2 consistently activates by reaction with C2H4, and products form subsequently through peroxo- and oxometallacycle surface complexes. Taken together, density functional theory calculations and kinetic and transient experimental measurements show that the formation of peroxide intermediates requires oxidation of the Ag surface (via subsurface oxygen), and an increase in surface peroxides coincides with the highest EO selectivity for the unpromoted Ag catalyst. These findings suggest that the promoters ubiquitous for ethylene epoxidation (e.g., chlorine, transition metals, and alkali metals) may succeed by oxidation of Ag and increasing coverages of peroxides at industrial conditions.
