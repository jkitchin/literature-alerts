The Z-scheme system, integrating an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) with a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP), is an ideal strategy for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS), in which the development of an efficient OEP remains a challenge. Herein, the GaN:ZnO photocatalyst was synthesized by an ammonium halide-based process to perform a recorded apparent quantum yield of 30% at 420 nm for oxygen evolution from water. It made the GaN:ZnO a remarkable OEP for the construction of three distinct Z-scheme OWS systems, including an unbiased-photoelectrochemical sheet, direct collision, and redox-ion-mediated electron shuttle. The features and parameters of each Z-scheme system were discussed in relation to water splitting, and the most efficient one was established by employing [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– as an electron shuttle and SrTiO3:Rh as an HEP. This work not only provides a methodology for synthesizing an efficient GaN:ZnO photocatalyst but also highlights its great potential as an OEP applicable to constructing various Z-scheme OWS systems.

The complex reaction network of catalytic biomass conversions often involves hundreds of surface intermediates and thousands of reaction steps, greatly hindering the rational design of metal catalysts for these conversions. Here, we present a framework of machine learning (ML)-accelerated first-principles studies for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of propanoic acid over transition metal surfaces. The microkinetic model (MKM) is initially parametrized by ML-predicted energies and iteratively improved by identifying the rate-determining species and steps (RDS), computing their energies by density functional theory (DFT), and reparameterizing the MKM until all the RDS are computed by DFT. The Gaussian process (GP) model performs significantly better than the linear ridge regression model for predicting both the adsorption free energies and transition state free energies. Parameterized with energies from the GP model, only 5–20% of the full reaction network has to be computed by DFT for the MKM to possess DFT-level accuracy for the TOF and dominant reaction pathway. While the linear ridge regression model performs worse than the GP model, its performance is greatly improved when only transition states are predicted by the regression model and adsorption energies are computed by DFT. Overall, we find that a high accuracy in adsorption free energies is more important for a reliable MKM than a high accuracy in TS free energies. Finally, based on the GP model with GOH and GCHCHCO as catalyst descriptors, we build two-dimensional volcano plots in activity and selectivity that can help design promising alloy catalysts for HDO reactions of organic acids.

The electrochemical oxidation of alcohols is being explored as a favorable substitute for the oxygen evolution reaction owing to its capability to generate high-value products and lower overpotentials. Herein, we present a systematic investigation into the electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a model biomass platform chemical, on a thin-film nickel catalyst, aiming to investigate the underlying reaction mechanism and shed light on the role of the catalyst's microenvironment and phase on activity and product selectivity. Utilizing a combined experimental and computational approach, we demonstrate that NiOOH is the active phase for HMF oxidation. Additionally, we find a substantial impact of the electrochemical environment, particularly the electrolyte pH, on the reaction. Under highly alkaline conditions (pH = 13), higher activity for HMF oxidation is observed, accompanied by an increased selectivity toward 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) production. Conversely, a less alkaline environment (pH = 11) results in diminished HMF oxidation activity and a higher preference for the partial oxidation product 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). Mechanistic insights from DFT studies reveal that geminal diols that are present under highly alkaline conditions undergo hydride transfer via HMFCA, while a shift to an alkoxide route occurs at a lower pH, favoring the DFF pathway. Hydride transfer energetics are also strongly affected by the surface Ni oxidation state. This integrated approach, bridging experimental and computational insights, provides a general framework for investigating the electrochemical oxidation of aldehydes and alcohols, thereby advancing rational design strategies in electrocatalysts for alcohol electro-oxidation reactions.

Replacing H2 with H2O as the hydrogen source for the water-involved selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol (WSHCC) is very attractive yet is underdeveloped by a much lower H2O conversion rate than H2. Here, we report the realization of a high-efficiency WSHCC process by a synergy of CO adsorption and H2O dissociation over a Au/α-MoC1–x boundary. It shows a specific molar rate of 60.86 mol molAu–1 h–1 to cinnamyl alcohol at 96 °C, which is nearly 12-fold that reported earlier, and maintains a high conversion of over 99% and a high selectivity of 77%. Mechanistic studies indicate that the Au/α-MoC1–x boundary accommodates atomically dispersed Auδ+ sites for adsorbing CO, vacating oxygen-covered α-MoC1–x and thereby creating isolated Mo sites for the preferred adsorption and hydrogenation of C═O bonds over that of C═C bonds. This provides a catalyst design strategy for high-efficiency C═O hydrogenation by water.

Controlling the location and microenvironment of active centers in the zeolite framework is critical for understanding the in-depth structure–performance relationships of catalytic systems and constructing highly efficient catalysts. Herein, we have developed an MOR-type titanosilicate (denoted as 6M-Ti-M360) with an extremely low framework Ti content (Si/Ti = 300), exhibiting not only ultrahigh catalyst weight-based conversion (81%) but also a record-breaking turnover number (TON = 5845) per Ti site in batchwise ammoximation of cyclohexanone. Its highly isolated and active Ti species took the specific position of defective T3 sites within the eight-member ring side pockets of the MOR topology, evidenced by molecular dimension-dependent shape-selective experiments and theoretical evaluation of the catalytic activation ability of the different crystallographic Ti sites at the molecular level. Despite an extremely low Ti content but with the most active Ti on the defective T3 sites, the 6M-Ti-M360 catalyst maintained the cyclohexanone conversion and cyclohexanone oxime selectivity both as high as 99% for a long lifetime (314 h) in a continuous slurry bed reactor, capable of producing 1100 kg of oxime per gram of Ti. The clarification of the location and local microenvironment of Ti active sites may provide new insights into the exploration and construction of highly active sites in zeolitic catalysts.    

    

## Beyond the Chemical Step: The Role of Substrate Access in Acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis

Acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis is a versatile enzyme, which catalyzes the transesterification of esters in aqueous media due to a kinetic preference of the synthesis reaction over the thermodynamically favored hydrolysis reaction. In the active octamer, the active site is deeply buried and connected to the protein surface by long and hydrophobic substrate access channels. The role of the access channel in controlling catalytic activity and substrate specificity was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov-state models, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of binding of acyl donors, acceptors, and water were compared. Despite the hydrophobic nature of the substrate access channel, water is present in the channel and competes with the acyl acceptors for access to the active site. The binding free energy profiles in the access channel and the flux of butyl and benzyl alcohol and vinyl acetate were analyzed in the concentration range between 10 and 500 mM and compared to water. The flux showed a maximum at an alcohol concentration of 50–100 mM, in agreement with experimental observations. At the maximum, the flux of alcohol approaches 50% of the flux of water, which explains the high transesterification rate as compared to hydrolysis. The molecular origin of this effect is due to the accumulation of alcohol molecules along the access channel. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of trajectories by a Markov-state model provided insights into the role of the access channel in activity and specificity by controlling access and binding of competing substrates.

Selectivity control of supported metal catalysts, which are most widely utilized in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, is of great scientific significance to obtaining the desired chemical product in a multipath reaction but has remained a grand challenging issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation from CH4 to CO can be tuned by a robust and unique support doping strategy by changing the reduction activity of H species over M/Ce1–xPrxO2−δ (M = Ru, Rh) in which metal (M) nanoclusters showed the same existence form on differently doped ceria nanorod supports. The CH4 selectivity of the catalyst decreased with an increase in the Pr content in the support. The selectivity of CH4 on Ru/CeO2 was higher than 90%, while on Ru/Ce0.2Pr0.8O2−δ, the selectivity of CO reached 80%. A variety of techniques, including steady-state isotope transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) type in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)–mass spectrum (MS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), had been applied in this work to analyze the structure–activity relationship between the doping of Pr and the selectivity of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru sites were not directly involved in the hydrogenation of carbon-containing intermediate species (including bicarbonate and formate) during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The active H species on the support sites, which are incorporated in RE3+–OH, directly contacted and reacted with the carbon-containing intermediate species. The introduction of Pr in the support weakened the reducing ability of the support, thus decreasing the reducing ability of H species on the surface of the catalyst, which further hindered the conversion of formate into CH4, resulting in the declined CH4 selectivity. Our study clearly revealed the important role of support in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction and proposed a strategy to modulate the reaction selectivity via support doping. By changing the redox performance of the support, the activity of H species on the support can be adjusted. Thus, the conversion of important reaction intermediates (such as formate) can be affected, so as to achieve precise regulation of the reaction products. We have provided a broader perspective for the selective catalyst design of heterogeneous catalysis and the reaction mechanism study of supported metal catalysts.

Various decarbonylation reactions via oxidative addition of carbonyl compounds to metal catalysts can be applied to late-stage modification and have been actively studied to date; however, several inherent problems derived from the oxidative addition are difficult to solve, such as toxic CO production, deactivation of catalysts by CO adsorption, intolerance of some functional groups, or air-sensitivity of catalysts. In this context, formal decarbonylation, which eliminates CO as other compounds without involving oxidative addition, is attractive but hardly reported, especially using heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, formal decarbonylation of diaryl 1,2-diketones to afford monoketones using CeO2 as a reusable heterogeneous catalyst and O2 in the air as the terminal oxidant was developed, generating CO2 as the only byproduct. The results revealed that the reaction was enabled by the synergistic catalytic effect of the Lewis acid–base pairs and redox properties in CeO2.

Efficient hydrogen (H2) production from renewable resources, such as biomass, one of the largest renewable resources on the earth, instead of fossil resources, is highly desirable. Making it via HCO2H as an intermediate for H2 production from biomass both facilitates efficient H2 production and can avoid the issues of H2 storage. Herein, we report efficient H2 production from raw biomass-based formic acid (HCO2H) by a noble-metal-free catalysis system under mild conditions, enabled by cooperation of CdS/ZnS-S2– quantum dots photocatalysts with weak formaldehyde (HCHO) adsorption and in situ generated Ni0, resulting in H2 with a 94% yield in 3.5 h, with a 99.7% selectivity and a 537 ± 14 mol mg–1 h–1 average rate at 50 °C under visible-light irradiation. This study should promote the exploration of catalytic systems for streamlined H2 production from renewable biomass for practical application.

The artificial synthesis of amino acids is an important yet challenging subject. Electrocatalytic C–N coupling from organic acids and nitrogen sources provides an opportunity for this target but with the difficulty of C–N bond formation toward the production of amino acids. Herein, we report the synthesis of amino acids (alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, leucine, valine) from nitrate and α-ketoacids with a hybrid catalyst, cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on carbon nanotubes (CoPc/CNT). The Faradaic efficiency for alanine production with CoPc/CNT is as high as 61%. The CoPc catalyst integrated with CNTs can catalyze nitrate reduction to hydroxylamine, which is switched from a thermodynamically uphill to a downhill process. The hydroxylamine intermediate attacks the α-carbon of an α-ketoacid to form an oxime. Amino acids are produced by the reduction of oximes catalyzed by CNTs. The bifunctionality of CoPc/CNT steers the tandem catalytic reaction toward the efficient production of amino acids in one pot. This work identifies that enhancing the reduction of nitrate to hydroxylamine is the key to C–N bond formation in amino acid synthesis.

Intermetallic compounds possess superior catalytic performance over their disordered alloy counterparts, while their synthesis usually requires high-temperature treatment, which causes the sintering of catalysts. This work demonstrates the high-temperature confinement synthesis (HTCS) of PtCo intermetallic compounds for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by integrating ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon shell (NCS) confined PtCo alloy into −NH2 functionalized black pearls 2000 carbon architectures (PtCo@NCS/BP-NH2). Benefiting from amino tethering and carbon shell confinement, high-temperature sintering behavior is effectively inhibited. PtCo@NCS/BP-NH2 possesses outstanding ORR performance, and the assembled single cell exhibits a small peak power density loss rate of 4% after the accelerated durability test (ADT), outperforming PtCo/BP (12.5%) and commercial Pt/C (18.9%). Theoretical calculations along with experiments reveal that PtCo and NCS synergically optimize the electronic structure, weaken the Pt–O dipole effect, and lower the reaction barrier for ORR. The study provides insight into the HTCS of catalysts and unveils intrinsic electronic interaction for ORR.

The epoxidation of ethylene stands as one of the most important industrial catalytic reactions, and silver-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity. Oxygen is activated on the surface of silver during the reaction and exerts a substantial impact on product selectivity. Notably, the oxygen species residing in the topmost atomic layers profoundly influence the reactivity of a catalyst. However, their characterization under in situ reaction conditions remains a huge challenge, and specific structures have not been identified yet. In this study, we employ in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to determine the oxygen species formed at the topmost atomic layers of a silver foil and to assign them a structure. Three different groups of oxygen species activated on silver are identified: (i) surface lattice oxygen and two oxygen species originating from associatively adsorbed dioxygen and (ii) top and (iii) subsurface oxygen. Transient in situ photoelectron spectroscopy experiments are carried out to reveal the dynamic evolution and thus reactivity of the different oxygen species under ethylene epoxidation reaction environments. The top oxygen atom from the adsorbed associated dioxygen is the most active. Meanwhile, a frequency-selective data analysis method, developed to process time-resolved data, provides insights into the evolving trends of peak intensities for different oxygen species.

The conversion of H2S to high-value-added products is appealing for alleviating environmental pollution and realizing resource utilization. Herein, we report the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline using waste H2S as a "hydrogen donor" over the catalyst of FeCeO2−δ with abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov), especially an asymmetric oxygen vacancy (ASOv). The electron-rich nature of the ASOv sites facilitates electron transfer to the electron-deficient nitro group, promoting the adsorption and activation of Ph–NO2 through the elongation and cleavage of the N–O bond. Benefiting from the formation of abundant ASOv sites, the resulting FeCeO2−δ achieves an impressive 85.6% Ph–NO2 conversion and 81.9% Ph–NH2 selectivity at 1.5 MPa and 90 °C, which surpasses that of pure CeO2 with flower and rod morphologies. In situ FT-IR measurements combined with density functional theory calculations have elucidated a plausible reaction mechanism and a rate-limiting step in the hydrogenation of Ph–NO2 by H2S.

Molybdenum sulfides (MoSx) in both crystalline and amorphous forms are promising earth-abundant electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid. Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition was used to prepare thin films of both amorphous MoSx with adjustable S/Mo ratio (2.8–4.7) and crystalline MoS2 with tailored crystallinity, morphology, and electrical properties. All the amorphous MoSx films transform into highly HER-active amorphous MoS2 (overpotential 210–250 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4) after electrochemical activation at approximately −0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. However, the initial film stoichiometry affects the structure and consequently the HER activity and stability. The material changes occurring during activation are studied using ex situ and quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Possible structures of as-deposited and activated catalysts are proposed. In contrast to amorphous MoSx, no changes in the structure of crystalline MoS2 catalysts are observed. The overpotentials of the crystalline films range from 300 to 520 mV at 10 mA/cm2, being the lowest for the most defective catalysts. This work provides a practical method for deposition of tailored MoSx HER electrocatalysts as well as new insights into their activity and structure.

The electrochemical coupling of biomass platform molecules to biofuels provides a promising method for addressing energy crises and environmental issues. However, achieving high yields of C–C coupling products under ambient conditions remains a challenge. Herein, we present a highly efficient electrocatalyst, [Cu(pz)]3[PW12O40] (Cu-PW12), fabricated by combining a Cu-pz complex (pz = pyrazine), a redox catalytic center, with Keggin-type PW12O40, and an electron sponge. Cu-PW12 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity for the electroreductive C–C coupling of furfural (FF), a bulk and low-cost biomass platform chemical, to produce a jet fuel precursor, hydrofuroin (HDF). Under neutral and ambient conditions, over 99% of FF is converted and the selectivity of HDF reaches 91.2%. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical studies, including control experiments, kinetic isotope studies, electrochemical and spectral analyses, and DFT calculations, reveal a synergistic catalysis effect between Cu center and PW12. The introduction of PW12 not only facilitates electron transfer, improving FF conversion, but also changes the rate-determining step, favoring the formation of HDF. Under turnover conditions, the Cu-PW12 catalyst is initially reduced and then FF is reduced by the Cu center to ketyl radical after protonation on the electrode surface. Finally, the self-coupling of two ketyl radicals in solution leads to the generation of HDF.

We have achieved the arenophile-mediated, copper-catalyzed dearomative trans-1,2-carboamination of nonactivated arenes with alkyl organometallic nucleophiles. This simple and practical procedure was used to prepare diverse, stereochemically rich alkylated cyclohexadienes from readily available arenes. Synthetic utility was demonstrated through the rapid preparation of complex small molecules difficult to access by conventional routes. Finally, we conducted DFT studies to explore the catalytic process, including a study of the reaction pathway and an examination of the divergent regioselectivity observed with substituted arenes.

Precisely engineering point defects holds promise for the development of state-of-the-art photocatalysts for CO2 conversion. This study demonstrates the controllable creation of nitrogen vacancies (VNs) in the centers of heptazine rings of graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) via a photochemical-assisted nitrogen etching strategy. Spectroscopic analyses and theoretical simulations elucidate the photochemical process to hydrogenate the nitrogen situated at the center of the g-C3N4 heptazine ring and then release an ammonia molecule, accompanied by the photooxidation of the sacrificial agents. The catalyst with an optimal VNs concentration achieves a CO generation rate of 35.2 μmol g–1 h–1 with nearly 100% selectivity, comparable to the performance of the reported g-C3N4 materials. The remarkably improved photoactivity is due to the adjustments of the electronic structures and the midgap states of g-C3N4 by the delocalized π electron cloud created in the 12-membered ring surrounding the VN, which maximizes the light-harvesting efficiencies and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The VNs also activates the neighboring catalytic carbon centers to reduce the energy barrier for CO2 reduction. This work provides a good design concept to regulate catalytic activity by engineering point defects.

Controlling the precise placement of active metals on supports is highly desirable yet challenging, which governs both the reaction pathway and the ultimate outcomes of catalytic reactions. Herein, the Cu species are positioned to the Lewis acidic sites created by the ultrahigh-temperature calcination of TiO2, where the atomic structures of the Lewis acids are identified as five-coordinated Ti4+ cations bound to three-coordinated O2– anions (Lβ sites) by in situ characterizations. Owing to the robust chemical affinity, CuOx manifests itself as a nanopatch. The Cu/TiO2 catalyst without any modifications exhibits a propylene oxide (PO) formation rate of 44 mmol gCu–1 h–1 for direct epoxidation of propylene using molecular oxygen (DEP). The PO yield on Cu/TiO2 can be efficiently correlated with the quantity of the decreased Lewis acids, which demonstrates that the intimated interaction between the Cu species and Lewis acids should be responsible for PO production. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations suggest that Cu+ in the Ti–O–Cu interface formed at the Lβ sites is the active site of the DEP reaction, with the aid of the adjacent Cu atom. This study provides a Cu-based catalyst for the DEP reaction.

Anthraquinone derivatives are classes of compounds employed in the production of valuable materials. Leuco-quinizarin, the 2-electron-reduced form of quinizarin (1,4-dihydroxy-anthraquinone), is a highly active and useful reactant for the synthesis of variety of anthraquinone derivatives. However, conventional methods of leuco-quinizarin synthesis require stoichiometric amounts of inorganic reductants and acids or bases. We developed Pt/DMPSi-Al2O3 and Pt-Ni/DMPSi-Al2O3 as highly active and selective heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of quinizarins to leuco-quinizarins under neutral and continuous-flow conditions. Remarkably, bimetallic effects of Ni and Pt nanoparticle systems were highlighted in the selective hydrogenation of the substituted quinizarin. In addition, the continuous-flow synthesis of leuco-quinizarin and its derivatization reaction were integrated to be a fully continuous process using flow-batch-separator unified reactors.

The CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2–ODHP) is a highly important reaction for not only producing large amounts of propylene but also consuming the CO2 resource. GaN/zeolite catalysts deliver preferable activity in the reaction. However, similar to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, there are shortcomings such as poor stability and coke accumulation, especially when operated at temperatures higher than 550 °C. Generally, carbon deposition is one of the main reasons for catalyst deactivation. The limited mass transfer greatly aggravates the deposited carbon formation, since carbon precursors could not be removed in time. In the present work, we modified zeolites with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores, which could offer a shorter diffusion distance and pore-rich structure to enhance the mass transfer. Thanks to this enhancement, the catalyst offers an initial propane conversion of 68.0% with a yield of 39.4% to propylene, surpassing other reported GaN/zeolite catalysts to data. Importantly, the catalyst showed a low loss rate of activity and a low amount of deposited carbon, which was easily regenerated compared with those of other catalysts without a short b-axis or hierarchical pores. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirmed that the reaction involves a coupling reaction of direct dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction via reverse water–gas shift reaction, and CO2 participates in the reaction. The present work sheds light on designing an efficient catalyst for CO2–ODHP via a mass transfer-boosted strategy and, importantly, is expected to provide inspiration in constructing a zeolite with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores.
