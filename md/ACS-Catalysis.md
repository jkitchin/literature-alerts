The shuttling of redox-active nicotinamide cofactors between the light and dark cycles is the key to the continuous production of biomass in photosynthesis. The replication of such processes in artificial photosynthetic systems demands fast photoregeneration as well as simultaneous integration of these nicotinamide cofactors into the dark cycle. Here, we report the design of an artificial photosynthetic system for the continuous production of butanol via the constant photoregeneration and consumption of nicotinamide cofactors, powered by an indium phosphide quantum dot (InP QD) photocatalyst and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme, respectively. A strong electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged InP QDs and electron mediators significantly enhanced the charge extraction and utilization processes, enabling a fast (∼30 min, with a turn over frequency of ∼1333 h–1), quantitative (>99%), and selective photoregeneration of enzymatically active nicotinamide cofactors in the light cycle. These photoregenerated nicotinamide cofactors were further coupled in the dark cycle to trigger the ADH oxidoreductase enzyme for the production of butanol, via sequential as well as simultaneous light–dark cycles. The amount of butanol produced under simultaneous light–dark cycles was higher than the stoichiometric limit, proving the constant regeneration and consumption of nicotinamide cofactors in light and dark cycles, respectively. Thus, a proper design and integration of the InP QD-based photocatalytic cycle with the enzymatic cycle led to the effective electron shuttling between light and dark cycles, as seen in photosynthesis.

In the presence of Pd(Xantphos) and an electron-deficient arylboronic acid cocatalyst, azoles such as pyrazoles, triazoles, tetrazoles, and purines undergo regioselective, dehydrative allylations with allylic alcohols. The boronic acid has a significant effect on both the rate and the regioselectivity of these reactions. Herein, a combined experimental and computational mechanistic study of the synergistic organoboron- and palladium-catalyzed allylation of azoles is described. Kinetic analysis and an evaluation of the effects of arylboronic acid substitution on the reaction rate point toward turnover-limiting ionization of the allylic alcohol, with Lewis acid activation by the boronic acid. Computational modeling of the reaction pathway with density functional theory indicates that allylic alcohol ionization is also the regioselectivity-determining step and that the resulting ion pair undergoes C–N bond formation through an outer-sphere mechanism. An unexpected observation of autocatalysis that emerged from the kinetic analysis motivated a study of the effects of additives, leading to the development of an improved protocol.

The photoinduced unnatural reactions catalyzed by flavin-dependent enzymes usually proceed through reduction pathways, which required the use of electron-sacrificial reagents. Herein, we developed a photoenzymatic redox-neutral radical hydrosulfonylation induced by oxidated flavin (FMN) with sulfinates or sulfonyl hydrazines as radical precursors. The reaction involved the excited FMN acquiring an electron from the substrate, and the resulting sulfuryl radical was captured by an alkene. It is then stereoselectively quenched by flavin semiquinone (FMNsq) through hydrogen atom transfer. This study circumvents the need for NADPH recycling systems and expands the potential reaction patterns in photobiocatalysis.

The asymmetric photoenolization/Diels–Alder reaction provides a straightforward and atom-economical route to complex chiral polycyclic rings. In comparison with well-developed transformations of 2-alkylbenzophenones, the enantioselective photoenolization/Diels–Alder reaction of 2-methylbenzaldehydes was challenging due to the shorter-lived and unstable photoenol intermediates. Herein, we present a highly enantioselective photoenolization/Diels–Alder reaction of 2-methylbenzaldehydes with chromones. Chiral N,N′-dioxide/ScIII and YbIII complexes were found to interact with both photoenol intermediates and chromones simultaneously, accelerating the Diels–Alder reaction in an efficient and stereoselective manner. Experimental studies and DFT calculations were carried out to understand the reaction mechanism and the origin of stereoselectivity. In addition, 2-alkylbenzophenones were suitable substrates. A series of chiral fused polycyclic rings with vicinal multisubstituted stereocenters were afforded in good yields and high diastereo- and enantioselectivities.

Robust earth-abundant transition metal-based photocatalysts are needed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A series of six Ni(II) complexes have been synthesized with a tridentate CNC pincer ligand composed of two imidazole or benzimidazole-derived N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) rings and a pyridyl ring with different R substituents (R = OMe, Me, H) para to N of the pyridine ring. These complexes have been characterized by using spectroscopic, analytic, and crystallographic methods. The electrochemical properties of all complexes were studied by cyclic voltammetry under N2 and CO2 atmospheres. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and HCO2– was analyzed using all of the complexes in the presence and absence of an external photosensitizer (PS). All of these complexes are active as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction with and without the presence of an external PS with appreciable turnover numbers (TONs) for formate (HCO2–) production and typically lower amounts of CO. Notably, all Ni(II) CNC-pincer complexes in this series are also active as self-sensitized photocatalysts. Complex 4Me with a benzimidazole-derived CNC pincer ligand was found to be the most active self-sensitized photocatalyst. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments and computational studies were performed to understand the mechanism of these catalysts. Whereas sensitized catalysis involves halide loss to produce more active complexes, self-sensitized catalysis requires some halide to remain coordinated to allow for favorable electron transfer between the excited nickel complex and the sacrificial electron donor. This then allows the nickel complex to undergo CO2 reduction catalysis via NiI or Ni0 catalytic cycles. The two active species (NiI and Ni0) demonstrate distinct reactivity and selectivity which influences the formation of CO vs formate as the product.

The formation and stabilization of Cu+ species are important to develop efficient Cu-based catalysts for the catalytic transfer hydrodeoxygenation (CTHDO) of renewable biomass to value-added products but challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of atomically dispersed Zr species into a CuOx matrix (Cu10Zr0.39Ox) greatly promoted its catalytic activity and stability for the CTHDO of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). In particular, almost quantitative DMF yield could be implemented over Cu10Zr0.39Ox accompanied by an impressive DMF formation rate of 8.1 mmolDMF·gcat–1·h–1, which outperforms the existing works for the CTHDO of HMF to DMF. Experimental and theoretical observations revealed that the electronic interactions between the doped Zr atom species and CuOx enabled the generation of ample and stable Cu+ species. The single-atom Zr species also promoted the adsorption and activation of the substrates and worked synergistically with Cu+ species to boost the CTHDO of HMF by reducing the reaction energy barriers.

Photoelectrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction provide an attractive route to produce solar fuels while reducing the level of CO2 emissions. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been extensively studied for this purpose in recent years due to their suitable optoelectronic properties. In this review, we survey the recent achievements in the field. After a brief introduction to photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes, we discussed the properties, synthesis, and application of MHPs in this context. We also survey the state-of-the-art findings regarding significant achievements in performance, and developments in addressing the major challenges of toxicity and instability toward water. Efforts have been made to replace the toxic Pb with less toxic materials like Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. The stability toward water has been also improved by using various methods such as compositional engineering, 2D/3D perovskite structures, surface passivation, the use of protective layers, and encapsulation. In the last part, considering the experience gained in photovoltaic applications, we provided our perspective for the future challenges and opportunities. We place special emphasis on the improvement of stability as the major challenge and the potential contribution of machine learning to identify the most suitable formulation for halide perovskites with desired properties.    

    

## Coupling Waste Plastic Upgrading and CO2 Photoreduction to High-Value Chemicals by a Binuclear Re–Ru Heterogeneous Catalyst

Photocatalytically converting waste plastic to high-value chemicals is an energy-efficient and promising approach. Nonetheless, the limited photocatalytic efficiency due to the extremely low water solubility of the plastic and the excessive release of CO2 caused by overoxidation during the reaction seriously restricts its practical application. Herein, we propose a tandem process of waste Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic degradation and CO2 photoreduction on a chelating-ligand-anchored binuclear Re–Ru molecular heterogeneous catalyst. Specifically, waste PET plastics are depolymerized and photo-oxidized to monomers and formic acid on the molecular Ru sites, while the CO2 gas externally purged and generated in situ is photoreduced to CO with an impressive TON of 115 on the molecular Re sites. Compared with the corresponding homogeneous catalyst, the product selectivity is significantly improved from 65 to 95% in water-containing systems, and the TON is also greatly increased by nearly 19 times. Experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high photocatalytic performance is attributed to the significantly enhanced light-capture capability, efficient photogenerated electron transfer between bimetallic Re–Ru sites, and substantially enhanced CO2-trapping capacity by finely regulating the chelating-ligand-based organosilica nanotube framework structure. The real-world application in nature seawater indicates that this work will provide a practical and feasible technical route for the disposal of waste plastics and mitigating carbon emissions under environmental conditions.    

    

## Key Role of CO Coverage for Chain Growth in Co-Based Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis

Fischer–Tropsch synthesis converts CO and H2 to long-chain hydrocarbons. The reaction mechanism, a combination of C–O scission, C–C coupling, and hydrogenation steps, and the nature of the active sites remain intensely debated. In this work, we report a comprehensive, dual-site microkinetic model including more than 600 reversible reactions. Our model explicitly accounts for the high CO surface coverage under the reaction conditions by including a CO saturation coverage in the underlying DFT calculations. The model predictions match experimental kinetic observations with a methane selectivity of 18%, a chain growth probability of 0.83, a turnover frequency of 0.084 s–1, and an activation energy of 107 kJ/mol. A degree of rate control analysis identifies 12 rate-controlling steps, highlighting the challenges in building compact kinetic models based on one or two rate controlling steps. In the dominant reaction mechanism, CO is activated both at B5 step sites and at the terrace sites via H- and hydroxyl-assisted pathways. Chain growth occurs on the crowded terraces predominantly via CH coupling to alkylidine chains. While B5 step sites facilitate CO activation, a small concentration of 5% is sufficient to establish a quasi-equilibrium CH coverage on the terraces and higher concentrations do not notably change the model predictions.

Thermal approaches have played a dominant role in driving chemical reactions within the chemicals and fuels industries, benefiting from ongoing enhancements in efficiency via heat integration, catalyst development, and process intensification. Nevertheless, these traditional thermal approaches remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels, and there exists an urgent demand for the implementation of renewable energy technologies to synthesize fuels, commodity chemicals, and specialty chemicals. Nonthermal plasmas have gained considerable attention in recent years as a promising solution, and the prospects of combining plasmas with suitable catalysts have become even more appealing. Moreover, the evolution of nonthermal plasma catalysis approaches for the generation of clean hydrogen could be transformative in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This comprehensive review highlights the influential contributions in plasma catalysis for hydrogen production, discusses recent advancements, and provides future prospects for researchers aiming to advance the production of clean hydrogen.    

    

## Water-Mediated Photocatalytic Coproduction of Diesel Fuel Additives and Hydrogen from Dimethyl Ether

Dimethyl ether (DME) coupling via prior C–H bond scission affords H2 and long-chain oxygenates that can be used as diesel fuel additives. However, the C–H bond of DME is recalcitrant, requiring activation by oxidants for subsequent C–C bond coupling, and overoxidation to CO2 by nonselective oxidants is inevitable. Here, by establishing a channel for hole transfer from the Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst to DME, the C–H bond of DME is broken, affording H2 and diesel fuel additives consisting of glycol dimethyl ether (GDE) and oligomers. Adsorbed water on Pt/TiO2 fosters hole transfer by forming hydrogen bonds with both Pt/TiO2 surface and DME. Because of the hydrogen bonding, photogenerated holes are extracted from Pt/TiO2 by water and eventually transferred to DME. As a result, the productivities of the diesel fuel and H2 are increased by 8.7 and 12.4 folds, respectively. This work provides a route to produce two kinds of fuels from an abundant feedstock.

Plasmonic photocatalysis demonstrates great potential for efficiently harnessing light energy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic due to the transient nature of the reaction processes. Typically, plasmonic photocatalysis relies on the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in plasmonic materials, such as metal nanoparticles, leading to the generation of high-energy or "hot electrons", albeit accompanied by photothermal heating or Joule effect. The ability of hot electrons to participate in chemical reactions is one of the key mechanisms, underlying the enhanced photocatalytic activity observed in plasmonic photocatalysis. Interestingly, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy allows the analysis of chemical reactions driven by hot electrons, as both SERS and hot electrons stem from the decay of SPR and occur at the hot spots. Herein, we propose a highly efficient SERS substrate based on cellulose paper loaded with either Ag nanoplates (Ag NPs) or AgPd hollow nanoplates (AgPd HNPs) for the in situ monitoring of C–C homocoupling reactions. The data analysis allowed us to disentangle the impact of hot electrons and the Joule effect on plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis. Computational simulations revealed an increase in the rate of excitation of hot carriers from single/isolated AgPd HNPs to an in-plane with a vertical stacking assembly, suggesting its promise as a photocatalyst under broadband light. In addition, the results suggest that the incorporation of Pd into an alloy with plasmonic properties may enhance its catalytic performance under light irradiation due to the collection of plasmon-excitation-induced hot electrons. This work has demonstrated the performance-oriented synthesis of hybrid nanostructures, providing a unique route to uncover the mechanism of plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis.

Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of organics offers a promising route for producing value-added chemicals. However, a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism limits the efficient design of the catalysts. Herein, the two mechanisms are essentially identified on the Ni-based catalysts for acetonitrile hydrogenation, with a deeper understanding of their characteristics in view of their different performances. On this basis, an insight into the shift of the mechanism is proposed. Meanwhile, the optimization strategy of ECH is discovered, and the construction of Tafel sites (Ni/NiO interfaces) can greatly accelerate the kinetics, in addition to increasing the reactant coverage on the catalysts by modulating the electronic structures. Understanding the underlying mechanisms helps in manipulating the design of more efficient ECH catalysts.

Electrochemical ozone production (EOP), a six-electron water oxidation reaction, offers promising avenues for creating value-added oxidants and disinfectants. However, progress in this field is slowed by a dearth of understanding of fundamental reaction mechanisms. In this work, we combine experimental electrochemistry, spectroscopic detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxygen-anion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and computational quantum chemistry calculations to determine a plausible reaction mechanism on nickel- and antimony-doped tin oxide (Ni/Sb–SnO2, NATO), one of the most selective EOP catalysts. Antimony doping is shown to increase the conductivity of the catalyst, leading to improved electrochemical performance. Spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical experiments combined with quantum chemistry predictions reveal that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a critical reaction intermediate. We propose that leached Ni4+ cations catalyze hydrogen peroxide into solution phase hydroperoxyl radicals (•OOH); these radicals are subsequently oxidized to ozone. Isotopic product analysis shows that ozone is generated catalytically from water and corrosively from the catalyst oxide lattice without regeneration of lattice oxygens. Further quantum chemistry calculations and thermodynamic analysis suggest that the electrochemical corrosion of tin oxide itself might generate hydrogen peroxide, which is then catalyzed to ozone. The proposed pathways explain both the roles of dopants in NATO and its lack of stability. Our study interrogates the possibility that instability and electrochemical activity are intrinsically linked through the formation of ROS. In doing so, we provide the first mechanism for EOP that is consistent with computational and experimental results and highlight the central challenge of instability as a target for future research efforts.

The Fe-embedded N-doped graphene (Fe–N–C) is the most representative single atom catalyst (SAC) that has shown great potentiality in electrocatalysis, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the active moiety of Fe–N–C is still elusive due to contradictory experimental results. Moreover, early simulations mainly focus on the thermodynamic potential of adsorbates, while the effect of spin multiplicity receives little attention. To explore the role of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis, we employ the constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) to systematically study the structural evolution of the high-spin (HS) and intermediate-spin (IS) FeN4 site (marked by FeN4HS/IS) in OER and ORR processes. With the consideration of spin multiplicity, our simulation shows spontaneous oxidation from Fe(II)N4IS to Fe(III)N4HS at potential U = 0.4 V versus SHE. Further simulation indicates that the FeN4IS site undergoes a sequential adsorption of *OH and *OOH along with U increase, which leads to the spin state transition from IS to HS. According to the constant-potential free energy analysis, the FeN4HS*OOH is confirmed to be the practical active centers of OER, while the FeN4HS*OH and FeN4IS are assigned to the active center of ORR in low and high overpotentials. The predicted ORR activity of FeN4HS*OH agrees with the in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy measurement by Xiao et al. [Microporous Framework Induced Synthesis of Single-Atom Dispersed Fe-NC Acidic ORR Catalyst and its In Situ Reduced Fe-N4 Active Site Identification Revealed by X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy. ACS Catal. 2018, 8, 2824–2832]. Based on the geometry and orbital analysis, the bond length of Fe–N and coordination number of Fe center are found to have a significant impact on the d orbital splitting energy and thus induce the turnover of HS/IS stability in the OER/ORR intermediates. Our study brings comprehensive insights into the evolution of coordination and spin state in Fe–N–C, which reveals the significance of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis and benefits further theoretical design of SACs from the perspective of spin effects.

The synthesis of N–N axially chiral molecules in the enantiopure form has emerged as an interesting research topic primarily due to the significance and intricacy in synthesizing these molecules, especially bearing heterocyclic motifs. Herein, we disclose a method for the introduction of N–N axial chirality along with a point chiral center via the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of dihydropyridinone-containing indoles and pyrroles. The reaction follows a (3 + 3) annulation approach by the interception of indole/pyrrole-derived enamines with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes under oxidative NHC catalysis proceeding via the α,β-unsaturated acylazoliums. The N–N axially chiral indoles/pyrroles were formed under mild conditions in broad scope with high selectivity. In addition, preliminary DFT studies of the N–N rotational barrier of the axially chiral products were performed.

The synthesis of N–N axial compounds containing aromatic acyl amides using common acylation reagents remains challenging. We describe a highly atropenantioselective synthesis of N-aminoindoles containing N–N axes. A chiral cyclic isothiourea is used as the sole organic catalyst in the atropenantioselective transformation of the N-acylation reaction. Aroyl chlorides have been used as acylation reagents to construct atropisomeric compounds through N-acylation. The N-aminoindole products, which bear stereogenic N–N axes, were synthesized with high yields and enantioselectivities. Some of the enantiopure N-aminoindole products exhibited promising antibacterial activities against plant pathogens.

The coordination engineering of Fe–N–C single-atom catalysts (SACs) through introducing heteroatom dopants has attracted widespread attention in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the common regularity for tuning the ORR activity by coordinated and environmental heteroatoms has not been sufficiently studied. Herein, we study the ORR activity on 100 Fe–N–C SACs with S, P, and B heteroatoms in diverse coordination shells by density functional theory calculations. Based on the energy level distribution of frontier orbits and molecular orbital theory, it is found that the origin of Fe–N–C ORR activity is the hybridization of molecular orbitals of Fe 3dz2, 3dyz (3dxz), and O2*/OH* intermediates, where hybrid orbitals are adjusted by coordinated and environmental S, P, and B heteroatoms, and then the protonation process of O2* or OH* intermediate is determined. Moreover, we found that the Fe–O bond length, the d-orbital gap of spin states, the d-orbital center, and the valence state of the Fe site can be used as structural descriptors to predict the ORR activity governed by the protonation of O2* or OH* intermediate as potential-determining steps. Our structural descriptors rationalize the superior ORR performance of Fe–N–C with S or B atoms doped in the second coordination shell to those in the first coordination shell, as well as the fact that the P heteroatom is more suitable as a coordinated atom than the environmental atom to enhance the ORR activity of Fe–N–C, in available experimental references. Thanks to structural descriptors, the codoping synergistic effect between P in the first coordination shell and S in the second coordination shell is predicted and confirmed to greatly enhance the ORR activity. This study provides a unified mechanistic understanding on the ORR activity trend among Fe–N–C SACs regulated by coordinated and environmental heteroatoms.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key for the transition to a hydrogen-based energy economy. The observed activity of the OER catalysts arises from the combined effects of surface area, intrinsic activity, and stability. Therefore, alloys provide an effective platform to search for catalysts that balance these factors. In particular, high-entropy oxides provide a vast material composition space that could contain catalysts with optimal OER performance. In this work, the OER performance of the AuIrOsPdPtReRhRu composition space was modeled using an experimentally obtained dataset of 350 nanoparticles. This machine-learned model based on experimental data found the optimal catalyst to be a mixture of AuIrOsPdRu. However, as a "black-box model", it cannot explain the underlying chemistry. Therefore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to provide a complementary theoretical model with defined assumptions and, hence, a physical interpretation through comparison with the experimental model. The DFT calculations suggest that the majority of the activity originates from Ru and Ir active sites and that the addition of Pd improves the performance of these sites. However, the DFT calculation did not find the experimentally observed beneficial effects of Au and Os. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Os contributed to the performance of the tested catalysts by roughening the surface, whereas Au fulfilled the role of a structural support. Overall, it is demonstrated how machine learning can help accelerate catalyst discovery, and combining machine-learned models obtained from experimental data with models based on DFT calculations can provide important insights into the complex chemistry of OER catalysts.

N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have recently gained significant attention as capping ligands for gold nanoparticles due to their strong σ-donation properties. It has already been established that the strong σ-donation of NHCs enriches the surface of the gold nanoparticles, which controls the catalytic activity of the metal nanoparticles. Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) is a special class of carbene that offers stronger σ-donation than NHCs. This extremely electron-rich nature of CAAC projects it as a better surface capping ligand upon extrapolation on the Au(0) surface. In this work, we have isolated stable CAAC-stabilized AuNPs via a ligand exchange method and studied their catalytic behavior toward electrochemical CO2 reduction. These newly synthesized CAAC-stabilized AuNPs furnish a remarkable faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94% [at pH 6.3 for 2 h of controlled potential electrolysis at −0.7 V vs NHE (normal hydrogen electrode)] toward selective CO formation. Our work sets the platform for CAAC as a robust main group ligand on the surface of different metal nanoparticles, bridging the gap between main group ligands and surface chemistry.

A family of 4,4′-tBu2-2,2′-bipyridine (tBubpy) ligands with substituents in either the 6-position, 4,4′-tBu2-6-Me-bpy (tBubpyMe), or 6 and 6′-positions, 4,4′-tBu2-6,6′-R2-bpy (tBubpyR2; R = Me, iPr, sBu, Ph, or Mes), was synthesized. These ligands were used to prepare Ni complexes in the 0, I, and II oxidation states. We observed that the substituents in the 6 and 6′-positions of the tBubpy ligand impact the properties of the Ni complexes. For example, bulkier substituents in the 6,6′-positions of tBubpy better stabilized (tBubpyR2)NiICl species and resulted in a cleaner reduction from (tBubpyR2)NiIICl2. However, bulkier substituents hindered or prevented the coordination of tBubpyR2 ligands to Ni0(cod)2. In addition, by using complexes of the type (tBubpyMe)NiCl2 and (tBubpyR2)NiCl2 as precatalysts for different XEC reactions, we demonstrated that the 6 or 6,6′-substituents lead to major differences in the catalytic performance. Specifically, while (tBubpyMe)NiIICl2 is one of the most active catalysts reported to date for XEC and can facilitate XEC reactions at room temperature, lower turnover frequencies were observed for catalysts containing tBubpyR2 ligands. A detailed study on the catalytic intermediates (tBubpy)Ni(Ar)I and (tBubpyMe2)Ni(Ar)I revealed several factors that likely contributed to the differences in the catalytic activity. For example, whereas complexes of the type (tBubpy)Ni(Ar)I are low spin and relatively stable, complexes of the type (tBubpyMe2)Ni(Ar)I are high-spin and less stable. Furthermore, (tBubpyMe2)Ni(Ar)I captures primary and benzylic alkyl radicals more slowly than (tBubpy)Ni(Ar)I, consistent with the lower activity of the former in catalysis. Our findings will assist in the design of tailor-made ligands for Ni-catalyzed transformations.

Development of photocatalytic systems that facilitate mechanistically divergent steps in complex catalytic manifolds by distinct activation modes can enable previously inaccessible synthetic transformations. However, multimodal photocatalytic systems remain understudied, impeding their implementation in catalytic methodology. We report herein a photocatalytic access to thiols that directly merges the structural diversity of carboxylic acids with the ready availability of elemental sulfur without substrate preactivation. The photocatalytic transformation provides a direct radical-mediated segue to one of the most biologically important and synthetically versatile organosulfur functionalities, whose synthetic accessibility remains largely dominated by two-electron-mediated processes based on toxic and uneconomical reagents and precursors. The two-phase radical process is facilitated by a multimodal catalytic reactivity of acridine photocatalysis that enables both singlet excited state PCET-mediated decarboxylative carbon–sulfur bond formation and previously unknown radical reductive disulfur bond cleavage by a photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer process in the silane–triplet acridine system. The study points to a significant potential of multimodal photocatalytic systems in providing unexplored directions to previously inaccessible transformations.

Nanosized intermetallic Pt-transition metal alloys with high catalytic activity and stability are considered as promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the preparation of intermetallic Pt alloy nanoparticles remains a dilemma due to their pronounced tendency for sintering at high synthesizing temperatures. Here, we have synthesized several Pt intermetallics with an average size of 4 nm by employing carbon-supported Pt–-pyrrole complex and transition metal (TM = Fe, Co, Ni) salts as precursors. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) results indicate that not only the uniform pregrowth of the Pt–pyrrole complex onto the carbon support but also the subsequently derived N-doped carbon shells (<1 nm) on the nanoparticles during annealing contribute to the formation of the nanosized intermetallics. Additional characterization suggests that the intermetallic alloy structure endows the catalyst (PtCo@Pt/C-6) with a downshifted Pt d-band center, which implies the weakened adsorption of the ORR intermediates on the Pt alloy, thus facilitating the ORR kinetics. The fuel cell with the as-prepared PtCo@Pt/C-6 catalyst displays a rated peak power density of 1.1 W/cm2 at 0.67 V (H2/air) and a mass activity of 0.49 A/mgPt at 0.9 V, exceeding the targets of the US Department of Energy (1.0 W/cm2 and 0.44 A/mgPt, respectively). This method demonstrates great potentials for the scalable synthesis of PtTM/C catalysts with high ORR performance and promoting their applications in PEMFCs.

Directed evolution of enzymes often fails to obtain desirable variants because of the difficulty in exploring a huge sequence space. To obtain active variants from a very limited number of variants available at the laboratory scale, machine learning (ML)-guided engineering of enzymes is becoming an attractive methodology. However, as far as we know, there is no example of an ML-guided functional modification of flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). FMOs are known to catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions and are involved in the biosynthesis of many natural products (NPs). Therefore, it is expected that the ML-guided functional enhancement of FMO can contribute to the efficient development of NP derivatives. In this research, we focused on p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH), a model FMO, and altered only four amino acid residues around the substrate binding site. ML models were trained with a small initial library covering only approximately 0.1% of the whole sequence space, and the ML-predicted second library was enriched with active variants. The variant with the highest activity in the second library was PHBH-MWNL (V47M, W185, L199N, and L210), whose activity was more than 100 times that of the wild-type PHBH. For elucidation of the mechanism of the observed activity enhancement, the crystal structure of PHBH-MWNL in complex with 4-hydroxy-3-methyl benzoic acid was determined. In the PHBH-MWNL crystal structure, the missing water molecule WAT2 was observed due to N199 hydrogen-bonding to WAT2, indicating that the L199N mutation contributed to the observed functional improvement by stabilizing the proton relay network proposed to be important in catalysis.

Imine reductases (IREDs) have been identified as an important class of biocatalysts to synthesize chiral amines with substantial promise for industrial application. Here, we report the promiscuous imine reductase activity of a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). Starting from enzyme GDH Rd1bb, a commercial glucose dehydrogenase variant typically used for NAD(P)H regeneration, eight rounds of directed evolution were used to convert this enzyme into a highly active IRED for the chemo- and stereoselective manufacture of a chiral neprilysin inhibitor precursor, improved NADH cofactor specificity, and superior thermal stability. The evolved variant GDH Rd6bb achieved high productivity, with 99% conversion over 3 h at 50 g/L keto substrate concentration and 10% enzyme loading with respect to the keto substrate. Early process development studies at multigram scale provided the product in 94% yield with >99% purity as a single stereoisomer with an er of >99.9:0.1 and a dr of >99.9:0.1.

Herein, we report that enzymatic cascade reactions using a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and an ene-reductase (ERED) can be utilized for the synthesis of chiral 3-substituted cyclic alcohols and chiral-bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles. The crucial step in these cascade reactions is a kinetic resolution reaction by the multifunctional GDH mutant BsGDH_Q252K. This reaction selectively reduces the R-enantiomers of racemic ketone substrates, yielding enantiopure alcohols with high enantiomeric excess (ee) values of the remaining S-enantiomers. When the reaction is coupled with an ERED-promoted dehydrocyclization reaction, chiral-bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles with a configuration of (1S, 5R) can be conveniently synthesized in one pot. Meanwhile, the chiral alcohol products generated from the kinetic resolution reactions can be further converted to the R-enantiomers of the racemic ketone substrates through the cyclohexanol dehydrogenase activity of BsGDH_Q252K when coupled with an NAD(P)H oxidase. When the oxidase is replaced by an ERED, chiral-bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles with a configuration of (1R, 5S) can also be efficiently synthesized in one pot. Mechanistic studies revealed key amino acid residues in BsGDH_Q252K for the kinetic resolution reaction. Subsequent rational design of BmGDH, a homolog of BsGDH, yielded can also enable a quintuple mutant capable of performing this reaction, while the wild type BmGDH cannot.

Bimetallic alloy catalysts with finely controlled composition and atomic mixing of the two active metals are vital for maximizing their synergistic effect in enhancing catalytic performances. Herein, we report the design and synthetic strategy of bimetallic Cu–Co alloy catalysts well dispersed on Al2O3 from a CuCoAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) for boosting the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) performance by controlling the composition and textural properties of Cu–Co alloy particles. An optimized Cu9Co1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a remarkably high CO2 to CO conversion rate (∼0.247 mol h–1 gcat–1) with ∼99.4% of CO selectivity at a relatively low reaction temperature of 400 °C, which outperforms a monometallic Cu/Al2O3 catalyst and a reference Cu9Co1/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a conventional impregnation method. A combined experimental and theoretical study reveals that the superior activity of the Cu9Co1/Al2O3 catalyst is attributed to two factors: (i) a modified electronic structure due to the Cu–Co alloy formation that facilitates CO2 activation and CO desorption and (ii) formation of well-dispersed alloy nanoparticles by using LDHs as the catalyst precursors.
