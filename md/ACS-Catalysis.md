Reaction products in heterogeneous catalysis can be detected either on the catalyst surface or in the gas phase after desorption. However, if atoms are dissolved in the catalyst bulk, then reaction channels can become hidden. This is the case if the dissolution rate of the deposits is faster than their formation rate. This might lead to the underestimation or even overlooking of reaction channels such as, e.g., carbon deposition during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, which is problematic as carbon can have a significant influence on the catalytic activity. Here, we demonstrate how such hidden deposition channels can be uncovered by carefully measuring the product formation rates in the local gas phase just above the catalyst surface with time-resolved ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a case study, we investigate methane oxidation on a polycrystalline Pd catalyst in an oxygen-lean environment at a few millibar pressure. By ramping the temperature between 350 and 525 °C, we follow the time evolution of the different reaction pathways. Only in the oxygen mass-transfer limit do we observe CO production, while our data suggests that carbon deposition also happens outside this limit.

In this work, we show that the acid-site density controls the dominant cycle during the methanol-to-hydrocarbons reaction on beta zeolite. Our experimental evidence is based on the study of beta zeolites with very similar diffusional pathways and different aluminum content. High selectivity to propylene was observed for samples with low Brønsted acid-site density, which is a consequence of the promotion of the olefinic cycle. Our results also confirm that the production of ethylene via the olefinic cycle is negligible. In contrast, high ethylene and aromatics are found at a high Brønsted acid-site density, highlighting the predominancy of the aromatic cycle. Operando UV–vis data show that monoenylic carbocationic species predominate on the olefinic cycle, whereas the aromatic cycle is dominated by polyalkylated monoaromatics. Analysis of the spectroscopy data also shows a linear correlation of the formation of polyaromatic species with the Brønsted acid-site density.

Rhodium(III)-catalyzed atroposelective C–H selenylation of 1-aryl isoquinolines has been achieved. The direct C–H selenylation reaction between 1-aryl isoquinolines and 2-(phenylselanyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione in the presence of the chiral SCpRh(III) complex afforded a series of axially chiral 1-aryl isoquinoline selenides in up to 95% yield and 96% ee. The reaction features mild conditions and a broad substrate scope. DFT calculations revealed that the C–Se bond formation step proceeds through a formal SN2 pathway.

Allylic amines make up an important class of organic compounds that have inspired the development of numerous methods for their synthesis. One of the most effective transformations involves the coupling of internal alkynes with appropriate nitrogen-containing electrophiles in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. We have developed a method that allows transformation of terminal alkynes into allylic amines through a copper-catalyzed reductive cross coupling with α-chloro phthalimides. The method has a broad substrate scope and results in the highly selective formation of the E-isomer of the anti-Markovnikov hydroamination product. A preliminary mechanistic study supports a mechanism that involves the hydrocupration of the alkyne and the formation of a solvent-caged radical pair.

Fluorinated JohnPhos-type ligands are proposed as accelerating tools in homogeneous gold(I) catalysis, with PedroPhosAuCl (Cat1) as the most efficient one. The ligands as well as the corresponding gold complexes were synthesized in high yields and fully characterized also via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A secondary interaction between the distal phenyl ring of the phosphane ligand and the metal center is identified as key for the fine-tuning of the overall catalytic performance of the complexes. In particular, kinetic as well as computational analysis revealed that by accommodating F atoms on the biphenyl pendant of the ligand, more reactive organo-gold intermediates are realized toward subsequent nucleophilic condensations. The gold-catalyzed indole-hydroarylation of 1,6-enynes and the intramolecular hydroindolynation of alkynes have been adopted as benchmark reactions to exemplify these accelerating effects.

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have attracted considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts in reactions central to energy conversion and chemical transformation. In contrast to monometallic nanocrystals and metal alloys, SAAs possess unique and intriguing physicochemical properties, positioning them as ideal model systems for studying structure–property relationships. However, the field is still in its early stages. In this Perspective, we first review and summarize rational synthesis methods and advanced characterization techniques for SAA nanoparticle catalysts. We then emphasize the extensive applications of SAAs in a range of electrocatalytic reactions, including fuel cell reactions, water splitting, and carbon dioxide and nitrate reductions. Finally, we provide insights into existing challenges and prospects associated with the controlled synthesis, characterization, and design of SAA catalysts.

Because of their special physicochemical properties, pore-structured metal oxide catalysts are widely used in environmental catalysis, energy chemicals, fuel cells, medicine, and other related fields. In recent years, these oxides have also been increasingly studied in the catalytic purification of diesel engine exhaust gases. In this paper, the research progresses of preparation methods of porous metal oxide catalysts and their application in the catalytic purification of diesel engine exhaust were reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of different methods for the synthesis of porous metal oxide catalysts were elaborated, as well as the mechanism comparison of different types of porous metal oxide catalysts in catalytic purification of diesel engine exhaust pollutants. Finally, the current issues on the preparation of porous metal oxide catalysts and their development trends in application of diesel engine exhaust purification were summarized and discussed. The pore-structured metal oxide catalysts are beneficial for improving the contact efficiency between catalysts and pollutants, which can enhance the catalytic purification efficiency of catalysts. Meanwhile, the intrinsic activity is the most fundamental factor for determining their catalytic activity except for porous structure effects. In addition, this paper can help researchers to deeply understand the important effect of porous metal oxide catalysts in the treatment of diesel engine exhaust pollutants and provide theoretical guidance for the design and development of high-efficiency catalysts.

Catalytic hydrogenation of COx (CO and CO2) with renewable H2 represents a feasible practice for carbon capture and utilization and synthesis of chemical commodities, such as olefins, aromatics, and higher alcohols as well as liquid fuels. Direct synthesis via Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is considered as one of the most promising processes. Iron-based catalysts have been recognized as efficient candidates for catalytic hydrogenation of both CO and CO2 to value-added hydrocarbons due to their superior activities for C–O bond dissociative activation, reverse/water gas shift reaction, and C–C chain growth. The structural complexity and dynamic evolution of iron-based catalysts under COx-FTS conditions impose challenges on the understanding of the reaction mechanisms, the dynamic structure of active sites and further improvements of the catalytic performance. In this Review, we discussed the recent developments in characterization techniques for identifying the structural evolution of iron-based catalysts under reaction conditions. We also summarized feasible strategies to manipulate the process of the structural change via promoter interfacing, catalyst pretreating protocols, and application of external physical fields. Finally, we concluded the review by identifying current challenges and opportunities for the next generation of COx catalytic hydrogenation process with an emphasis on the combinatorial contributions from in situ/operando characterizations, chemometrics and machine learning.

Oxide-derived (OD) metals have been demonstrated as a kind of promising catalyst with superior catalytic activity for carbon dioxide electroreduction. Here we fabricate OD nanoporous silver by a simple, cost-effective electrochemical oxidation–reduction treatment, which enables reducing carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide with a Faradaic efficiency of 87% at −0.8 V vs RHE, significantly higher than that of untreated silver foil under the same conditions. Electron backscattered diffraction analysis reveals that there is a distinct grain refining during the initial CO2 electrochemical reduction from Ag oxide to OD-Ag. Experiment results indicated that the catalytic activity and selectivity are closely linked to the grain boundary and nanoporous structure on the surface, which has also been proven by theoretical calculation. However, after a long catalysis time (12 h), it was found that the surface grain coarsened and the thickness of the nanostructured layer reduced, resulting in the deactivation of the OD-Ag electrode. A dissolution–redeposition mechanism was proposed to govern the degradation of OD-Ag. The catalytic activity can be regenerated again by applying electrochemical oxidation–reduction treatment, which can increase the thickness of the porous layer and electrochemical active surface area significantly.

Enantioselective reduction of cyclopropenyl esters and ketones to optically active cyclopropanes has been achieved by using whole-cell-overexpressing ene-reductases (EREDs). By using these enzymes, trans-cyclopropanes were isolated in good yield and high enantiomeric excess. A wide range of optically active cyclopropane esters and ketones were obtained, and a variety of substituent patterns on the cyclopropenes were tolerated.

An unprecedented enzyme-catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization of achiral 2,5-cyclohexadienones has been reported. Using ene-reductases as the biocatalysts, a variety of γ,γ-disubstituted cyclohexadienones were reduced to the respective chiral cyclohexenones bearing an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 96%) along with low levels of over-reduction (less than 4% cyclohexanones in most cases) and good enantioselectivities (mostly 99% ee), which are superior to the enantioselectivities obtained with the chemocatalysis. A mutagenesis study indicated residue Q232 was likely important for NCR in providing cyclohexenones selectively over cyclohexanones, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to rationalize the good enantioselectivity and low level of over-reduction observed for this enzyme. The deuterium-labeling experiment suggested the hydrogen at the N5 atom of the reduced flavin cofactor added to the face of the substrate 1a that has the bulkier phenyl group facing toward it. The current work expands the substrate scope of ene-reductases, providing an efficient, stereoselective access to valuable chiral γ,γ-disubstituted cyclohexenones, and will stimulate the development of other classes of enzyme-catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization of cyclohexadienones.

Fluorine is a unique element with important roles in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials chemistry. The fluoroethyl group is an important fluoroalkyl functional unit that is widely used in clinical drugs, 19F probes and 18F PET diagnostic drugs. Chemo- and regioselective fluoroethylation is difficult in chemical synthesis. To date, no enzymatic reaction for selective fluoroethylation has been reported. Based on the widespread natural methyl donor S-adenosine-l-methionine (SAM), we designed and synthesized a fluoroethyl SAM analogue (FEt-SAM). A stability study revealed that FEt-SAM was very labile under physiological conditions and gave the fluorine-elimination product vinyl-SAM. We circumvented this problem by replacing the S in FEt-SAM with Se to give fluoroethyl Se-adenosyl-l-selenomethionine (FEt-SeAM). By using halide methyltransferase (HMT) and its mutant for the in situ production of FEt-SeAM, we created cascade reactions of the HMT mutant with methyltransferases and fluoroethylated several O-, N-, S-, and C-nucleophiles. For methyltransferases that did not recognize FEt-SeAM well, such as DnrK and NovO, simple mutagenesis of the conserved hydrophobic residues (Leu and Ile) in the SAM binding pocket to smaller amino acids significantly increased the activities. Therefore, we have provided a useful tool for the late-stage fluoroethylation of natural products and drugs. This method could also be used to enzymatically prepare probes for 19F NMR and 18F PET tests.

The electrocatalysts undergo structural reconstruction during electrocatalytic reactions, accompanied by significant variations in the catalytic activity and selectivity. However, it is still challenging to track in situ structural evolution and reaction process simultaneously to further figure out the origin of the surface reconstruction and its correlation to the electrocatalytic performance. By utilizing the species involved in formic acid electrooxidation reaction (FAER) as probe molecules, we employed electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS) to reveal that the surface reconstruction process occurred on Au core-Pt shell nanoparticles (Au@Pt NPs). Via potential-dependent Raman features, we clearly revealed that the Au atoms from the Au core can migrate to the ultrathin Pt shell during FAER. Importantly, in situ SERS spectra showed that the reconstruction of Au@Pt NPs originated from the CO produced during the electrocatalytic process. We further showed that this structural transformation reduces the CO binding strength on Pt surfaces and tailors the reaction pathways of the FAER, thus facilitating the pathway of direct dehydrogenation of formic acid to CO2 by 2.6 times. This work demonstrates the importance of structural evolution of electrocatalysts during the reaction process to the catalytic performance, providing insight for designing highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts.

Herein, we disclose a nickel-catalyzed dearomative reductive aryl-fluoroalkenylation of indoles by defluorinative coupling with gem-difluoroalkenes. The catalytic protocol affords a facile assembly of various monofluoroalkene-containing polycyclic fused indolines bearing two contiguous carbon stereocenters in high diastereo- and enantioselectivities with tolerance of diverse functional groups.
