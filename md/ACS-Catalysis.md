## In(OTf)3-Catalyzed (3 + 3) Dipolar Cyclization of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with N-Nucleophilic 1,3-Dipoles: Access to 2,3-Diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, 2,3-Diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptenes, and Enantiopure 2-Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes

The investigation into the synthesis of azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (azaBCHeps) as bioisosteres to flat aza-aromatics has garnered increasing attention, while it encounters significant challenges. Herein, we have demonstrated the In(OTf)3-catalyzed (3 + 3) dipolar cyclization of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with hydrazones and π-allyl-iridium 1,3-dipoles, engendering a diverse array of azaBCHeps. The cyclization of hydrazones and BCBs furnished densely substituted 2,3-diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes and 2,3-diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptenes under nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres, respectively. A combination of experimental and computational investigations lends robust support for the proton-transfer-interposed sequential mechanism. More importantly, by integrating In(OTf)3/iridium relay catalysis, enantiopure 2-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes were constructed through the (3 + 3) cyclization of BCBs with aza-π-allyl-iridium 1,3-dipoles, in situ generated from N-allyl carbonates. Both methodologies exhibit mild reaction conditions and good tolerance for various functional groups. Moreover, the copious derivatization of products highlights the utility of the newly synthesized heterobicyclic motifs as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.    

    

## Efficient Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propene over PtIn Nanoclusters Encapsulated in Hollow-Structured Silicalite-1

Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for propane dehydrogenation to propene. However, the high reaction temperature generally induces serious sintering and agglomeration of metal species, thus leading to rapid deactivation of the catalysts. Herein, PtIn nanoclusters (NCs) encapsulated in hollow-structured silicalite-1 (designated as PtIn@S1–H) was prepared using recrystallization method. This material shows high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The propane conversion and propene selectivity reach ∼45–47.5% and ∼99%, respectively, at 547 °C at least within 167.6 h. As a result, it displays a significantly higher specific activity for C3H6 formation (0.37–0.59 s–1) than Pt@S1, Pt@S1–H, and other reported Pt-based catalysts. Notably, its catalytic performance is well maintained for more than 3600 h, with propane conversion of ∼31–34% and propene selectivity of ∼91–95%, when pure propane is fed. More interestingly, this catalyst can be reused through regeneration. EXAFS, HAADF-STEM and DFT calculation, and AIMD simulation results show that hollow-structured silicalite-1 crystal morphology not only facilitates the formation of Pt5In3 alloy NCs but also inhibits NC aggregation and growth. PtIn@S1–H showed a TON ≥ 38996 in contrast to 5367, 4928, 798, and 542 obtained on PtIn@S1, PtSn@S1, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtIn/Al2O3, respectively, if the catalysts were considered to be deactivated when the propane conversion was decreased by 15%. This is because alloying of In into Pt NCs weakens the interaction of C3H7* intermediates with metallic Pt NCs and the adsorption of C3H6 on the catalyst surface, thus suppressing the C3H7* cleavage reaction and enhancing propane activation and propene selectivity.    

    

## Iridium Photoredox-Catalyzed Stereoselective C-Glycosylation with Tetrafluoropyridin-4-yl Thioglycosides: A Facile Synthesis of C-α/β-Glucogallins and Their Antioxidant Activity

We demonstrate an efficient, scalable, and stereoselective C-glycosylation with thioglycosides possessing a unique photoactive tetrafluoropyridin-4-yl (TFPy) thio radical leaving group, affording editable and medicinally and biologically essential C-α-glucogallin derivatives. In the presence of silyl enol ether acceptors, the desulfurative coupling reaction performs smoothly under mild conditions upon exposure to blue light irradiation. This versatile protocol permits the synthesis of sugar-drug chimeras by C1 ketonylation of complex drug-derived silyl enol ethers. The scale-up synthesis, anomeric epimerization, and post-C-glycosylation modification of ketone sugars showcase the reaction's potential utilities. Furthermore, the reaction could be applied to direct carbohydrate skeleton editing by equipping the leaving group on the nonanomeric position. The ketonylation is viable for unprotected TFPy thioglycoside, affording a direct route to unprotected ketonyl sugars. The concise six-step assembly of both configurated C-glucogallins from commercially cheap glucose pentaacetate and their antioxidant reactivity investigations underline the promising medicinal relevance of our current protocols. The reaction mechanism was investigated through a radical trapping experiment, an oxocarbenium trapping experiment, a fluorescence quenching experiment, and Stern–Volmer analysis, confirming that the major glycosyl radical intermediates are generated from the thioglycoside donors, whose tetrafluoropyridin-4-yl thio group could effectively quench the fluorescence of excited Ir(ppy)3 through an oxidative quenching process, and C-glycosylation with oxocarbenium is a complementary route to the product, accounting for examples with moderate selectivities.

Precisely designing the atomic coordination structure of the catalytic center is highly desired to lower the energy barrier of CO2 photoreduction. The present work shows that engineering Nb single atom coupled Bi–O vacancy pairs (VBi–O) into Bi24O31Br10 (BOB) atomic layers can create a preferential local asymmetric structure. This configuration can result in a stronger local polarization electric field and thus prolong the carrier lifetime, as proved by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Meantime, this unique Nb SA-VBi–O associate favors the formation of strong chemical interaction between key *COOH intermediate and catalytic center, thus lowering the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step. Benefiting from these features, a high CO generation rate of 76.4 μmol g–1 h–1 for CO2 photoreduction can be achieved over Nb SA-VBi–O BOB atomic layers in pure water, roughly 5.4 and 92.7 times higher than those of BOB atomic layers or bulk BOB, respectively. This work discloses an important paradigm for designing single atom coupled defect associates to optimize photocatalysis performance.

It has been a challenging task to clearly elucidate various structural features and how their interactions affect the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In this work, various factors, including crystallinity, specific surface area associated with morphology, energy band gap and energy levels, surface charge, and hydrophilicity, were employed to investigate the structure–property–activity correlations of β-ketoenamine-linked covalent organic framework (TpPa-1-COF) for photocatalytic H2 production, which could influence the light harvesting, charge separation and transfer, and surface catalytic active sites. By using different methods to prepare TpPa-1-COFs, we can regulate these influencing factors to investigate their relationship with activity. It is found that the TpPa-1-COF prepared by a molecular organization method (labeled as TpPa-1 (MO)) exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution activity compared with the TpPa-1-COF samples prepared by solvothermal methods using acetic acid (HOAc) as a catalyst (TpPa-1 (ST-HOAc)) and KOH solution as a catalyst (TpPa-1 (ST-KOH)), which is associated with the highest crystallinity, the optimal energy levels, the largest BET-specific surface area, and the best hydrophilicity for TpPa-1 (MO). Moreover, our findings suggest that the enhanced total photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency (ηtotal) of TpPa-1 (MO) may be mainly attributed to the efficient separation and migration of photogenerated charges (η2) and the vibrant surface catalytic active sites (η3). Overall, this work provides some deep insights into the structure–property–activity relation of TpPa-1-COF photocatalysts, which offers valuable inspiration and guidance for the thoughtful design of COF-based photocatalysts for H2 evolution.

Two-dimensional metal-containing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been employed as electrocatalysts. However, the metal sites were stacked within the layers with strong interactions, which hindered mass transport to them in the catalytic process. Herein, we constructed a pore-confined catalyst in a vinylene-linked COF for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via the Katritzky reaction. By anchoring the catalytic sites along the pore walls with covalent bonds, the catalytic units were well-exposed during the catalytic process and retained crystallinity and porosity, facilitating mass access to the metal sites. In addition, the electron/charge transported from the framework to the metal units modulated the electronic states, thus improving the catalytic activity. The catalytic COF exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.85 V and a mass activity of 109.7 A g–1, which are better than those of other reported COFs. Theoretical calculations revealed that the interaction between the framework and metal sites contributed to the easy formation of OOH* and OH*, resulting in high activity. This work provides insights into designing catalytic COFs based on C═C linkages.

The production of syngas from light hydrocarbons is a viable way of converting under-utilized hydrocarbon sources into valuable products until a full transition to renewable energy sources is achieved. However, current heterogeneous catalysts for syngas production suffer from deactivation, either by coking or oxidation. Here, we report on the behavior of model nickel catalysts within the context of ethylene partial oxidation and observe the catalyst-environment interaction as a function of reactant feed and temperature. Using a combination of operando microscopy and spectroscopy and focusing on a reaction regime characterized by synchronized self-sustained oscillatory dynamics, we are able to gain additional insights into the dynamic interplay between reactive species and active catalyst surfaces of varying reactivity. Real-time secondary electron imaging coupled with online mass spectrometry and thermal data shows that the oscillatory behavior is characterized by a highly active half-period during which the surface of the nickel catalyst is metallic and a less active half-period during which the surface is oxidized. Complementing the direct surface imaging, operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provides missing information about the alternating chemical state of the catalyst surface in the oscillating reaction regime. It reveals that changes in the gas phase composition (C2H4/O2 ratio) alter the population of reaction intermediates (e.g., carbides) on the nickel surface, which in turn drives the selectivity of the reaction toward different products. The observed chemical dynamics involve changes in gas-phase composition, rate-dependent heat of reaction, the chemical state of the catalyst, and the formation of reaction products, all of which are interconnected. Ultimately, the complex oscillations and catalytic behavior are attributed to a multistep mechanism that involves complete ethylene oxidation, dry and wet reforming of ethylene, and the reverse water gas shift reaction.

Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3–R) presents a promising pathway for carbon-neutral ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Enhancing NH3 selectivity through a tandem process can be achieved by combining Cu with a secondary metal, which allows for an adjustable binding energy between the bimetallic catalyst and key nitrogen intermediates. Herein, we developed a biphasic Ag–Cu heterostructure with a controllable elemental composition, which significantly improved NH3 production through tandem NO3–R. In-situ infrared spectroscopy and finite element simulations revealed that Ag serves as the active site for converting NO3– to NO2–, leading to a high localized concentration of NO2–, which is subsequently reduced to NH3 on adjacent Cu sites. Density functional theory calculations further confirmed the critical role of the Ag–Cu biphasic interface in promoting tandem NH3 production. This work offers valuable insights into the tandem NO3–R pathway in bimetallic heterostructures, providing a foundation for optimizing catalysts and advancing large-scale sustainable NH3 synthesis.

A series of shape-persistent bis-[C(sp3)-chelating] Ti2 (plus Zr2 and Hf2) complexes with a rigid linker component (xanthene or dibenzofuran) are presented. These structurally diverse assemblies display limited yet different conformational flexibility, and crucially, such geometric constraints confer access to a range of intermetallic separations and orientations to potentially enhance catalytic activity and cooperative effects. For ethylene polymerizations, the Ti2 catalysts (in conjunction with trityl borate) exhibit greater efficiencies and produced polymers with higher Mw than mononuclear controls, which is significant considering the more crowded environment for cofacial bimetallic sites. Proficient 1-hexene incorporations were observed for ethylene-(α-olefin) copolymerization reactions. The F-substituted m-aryl/dibenzofuran-linked catalyst (5), which is revealed by NMR analysis to be conformationally dissimilar to its F-absent congener, produced copolymers with higher Mw and elevated 1-hexene incorporation levels (up to 44%), when compared with its mono-Ti control (19%). These results suggest that catalyst frameworks with suitably adjustable conformations and Ti···Ti distances can facilitate bimetallic enchainment interactions with α-olefin substrates and their insertion.
