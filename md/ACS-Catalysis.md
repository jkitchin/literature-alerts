Biocatalysis is increasingly being adopted in industry for producing important chemicals in a selective and efficient manner. Engineering an enzyme can often confer it with an altered chemical scope, making it accessible to nontraditional and desirable chemistry. Identifying enzymes with the desired substrate specificity and activity, however, remains time-consuming and costly. Galactose oxidase (GOase) is a copper-dependent enzyme that converts alcohols to their corresponding carbonyls, an important transformation in industrial synthesis. Here, we present a machine learning aided protocol to develop a catalytic activity prediction model (R2 ∼ 0.7–0.9) for GOase based on a focused data set of engineered GOase variants with activity toward bulky benzylic secondary alcohols. The trained GOase activity prediction models (with no additional training) also partially retained their predictive power when applied to another member of the oxidase family, an aryl-alcohol oxidase. Inspired by the fragment-based optimization methods used in drug discovery, we developed an active-site structure-aware substrate library for select GOase variants. Experimental validation of a subset of the constructed substrate library against select variants indicates that the trained models provide reasonable prediction (R2 = 0.61) of GOase activity, enabling the identification of the best GOase variant from the select variant subset for each identified substrate. This ability to identify optimal GOase variants from the selected variants for the synthesis of industrially important chemicals was demonstrated for dyclonine, an FDA-approved drug. Our machine learning-guided approach enables rapid navigation of the substrate-activity scope of GOase, thereby reducing the burden of extensive experimental screening and streamlining the deployment of biocatalysis in industrial synthesis.

The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol represents a promising pathway for both mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and producing valuable platform molecules. CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 (CZA) is the catalyst used for the methanol production from CO2 due to its high activity under relatively mild conditions. Coproduction of CO reduces the methanol selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. In this work, the CZA catalyst has been promoted with halogens (Br, Cl, or I) using halobenzene precursors. The promotion with bromine significantly improves the methanol selectivity compared to the pristine catalyst. The effect was observed at different amounts of halogen deposited over the catalyst surface. A combination of characterization techniques and kinetic analysis enabled us to explain the effects of halogen on the catalytic performance. The presence of varying halogen amounts in the CZA catalyst enhances methanol selectivity in two ways: by suppressing the reverse water–gas shift reaction and by hindering methanol decomposition to CO.

Asymmetric catalytic reaction development depends critically on the matching of an appropriate catalytic scaffold with a substrate of interest. In many cases, a catalyst will be discovered to be quite selective for a given substrate, and that same catalyst is then evaluated for its scope with respect to alterations of the substrate. In the context of a catalytic atroposelective cyclocondensation, we discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyst, (R)-TCYP, mediated these processes with up to 98:2 enantiomeric ratio (er) and up to 95% yield. Yet, when the same reaction was attempted in the presence of a basic nitrogen heteroatom within the substrate, enantioselectivity was significantly reduced (73:27 er). In this instance, a different catalyst scaffold based on phosphothreonine (pThr), while ineffective for the carbocyclic substrate (53:47 er), was found to be quite selective (90:10 er) for its pyridyl analog. Mechanistic studies exploring this divergence in reactivity unveiled that the 8-carbocyclic substrate [using (R)-TCYP] displayed a positive nonlinear effect (NLE), whereas the 8-heterocyclic substrate (using a pThr-based catalyst) displayed no NLE at all. The mechanistic distinctions between these two scenarios suggest significant differences in the nature of the non-covalent interactions that operate to deliver high enantioselectivity.

The assembly of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) provides a second coordination sphere around a metal catalyst. Such a well-defined microenvironment can lead to an enhancement of the activities and selectivity of the catalyst. Herein, we present the development of artificial hydroxylase (ArHase) by embedding an Fe-TAML (TAML = tetraamide macrocyclic ligand) catalyst into a human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII). Incorporation of the Fe-TAML catalyst ([BS-Fe-bTAML]–) within hCAII enhanced the total turnover number (TTON) for the hydroxylation of benzylic C–H bonds. After engineering a thermostable variant of hCAII (hCAIITS), the resulting ArHase, [BS-Fe-bTAML]–·hCAIITS, was subjected to directed evolution using cell lysates in a 384-well format. After three rounds of laboratory evolution, the best-performing variants exhibited enhancement in the initial rate (124.4 min–1) and in the TTON (2629 TTON) for the hydroxylation of benzylic C–H bonds compared to that of the free cofactor. We surmise that an arginine residue introduced in the course of directed evolution engages in hydrogen bonding with [BS-Fe-bTAML]–. This study highlights the potential of relying on a thermostable host protein to improve the catalytic performance of hCAII-based ArMs.

Regulation of the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process to avoid the unbalanced proton and electron regions on the reduction active sites is key to dictating product selectivity in a photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Here, we show that reversible Mo5+/Mo6+ as a mediator can regulate the proton and electron transfer process at the Bi2MoO6 nanosheet/In2O3 microtube (BI) catalyst. The formed concerted proton-coupled electron transfer enables a champion solar-to-methane efficiency of 0.15%, resulting in nearly 100% CH4 selectivity and a competitive CH4 yield of 46.37 μmol g–1 h–1 in pure water. The experiments, together with theoretical calculations, clearly validate that In sites as H2O oxidation centers provide protons, and the regulation of protons and electrons by using Mo sites forms approximate electroneutral proton/electron pairs, which are conjointly transferred to Bi sites as CO2 adsorption/reduction centers, thus achieving precise hydrogenation on Bi sites for binding of the *CH3O key intermediate to form CH4.

Carbon, with its high electrical conductivity and large surface area, enables the efficient dispersion and utilization of catalytic entities, contributing to the cost-effective development of electrochemical systems for a future energy economy. However, the longevity of these systems is often compromised by carbon corrosion, the fundamental details of which unfortunately remain largely unknown. Here, we elucidate that carbon corrosion is initiated by a covalent addition reaction that chemically breaks the sp2 carbon network, prior to electrochemical oxidation steps. Online differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and post-mortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy unveil the pseudozeroth- and first-order reaction kinetics in the proton concentration and oxygen coverage on the carbon surface, respectively, allowing us to suggest acid-catalyzed hydration with carbocation formation as the initial step in carbon corrosion. The proposed mechanism is further evidenced by the decreased carbon corrosion rate in the presence of the carbocation scavenger, methanol, and by the evolution of the C18O16O product during the corrosion of carbon, pretreated in acid solution prepared with the 18O-isotope of water. Based on these findings, previous empirical understandings, pH-dependent and site-specific (defect, edge, etc.) carbon corrosion characteristics, can be successfully explained, bringing potential avenues for developing rational strategies to mitigate carbon corrosion.

Herein, we demonstrate the ability of isonitriles to be used as alkyl radical precursors in a photoredox-catalyzed transformation involving selective C–N cleavage and Csp3–Csp2 bond formation. This protocol allows for the preparation of functionalized heteroarenes from readily available isonitriles through a decyanation process. The reaction is general for primary, secondary, and tertiary substrates, including amino acid derivatives and druglike molecules.

Chiral polysubstituted aromatic γ-butyrolactones are core structural units of many natural products and high value-added chemicals in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Currently, the precise construction of multiple chiral centers on the five-membered heterocycle substituted by bulky phenyl groups faces big challenges, such as low stereoselectivity, expensive noble metal catalysts, harsh reaction conditions and low atom economy. Herein, we report a one-pot, two-enzyme catalytic strategy for the synthesis of 18 bulky di/trisubstituted aromatic γ-butyrolactones on the α-, β- and γ-carbons with good enantioselectivities (up to >99% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to >99:1 dr). This cascade process includes sequential two-step asymmetric reduction of α-/β-unsaturated γ-ketoesters by four ene reductases and a carbonyl reductase without intermediate isolation and catalyst removal. In particular, the large sterically hindered substrates (1p–1s) were converted to the corresponding trisubstituted γ-butyrolactones (4p–4s) with 98–99% ee and >99:1 dr. This enzymatic cascade process represents a simple, atom-economic and enantioselective method to deliver a broad of bulky polysubstituted γ-butyrolactones in a cheap and efficient manner compared to conventional methods.

In this study, the high catalytic reactivity of ruthenium phosphide (RuP2) has been identified by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Complex surface reconstructions are considered by applying the ab initio grand canonical Monte Carlo (ai-GCMC) algorithm, efficiently providing a sufficient phase-space exploration of possible surfaces. Combined with surface-phase Pourbaix diagrams, we are able to identify the actual surfaces that obtained under specific experimental environments, thus leading to a more accurate understanding of the nature of the active sites and the binding strength of adsorbates. Specifically, through hundreds of surface reconstructions and hydrogenation states generated with ai-GCMC, we identify the most favorable surface phases of RuP2 under aqueous acidic conditions. We discover that the HER activity is determined by multiple surfaces with different stoichiometries within a narrow electrode potential window. Low HER overpotential (η) has been found for each of the identified surfaces, as low as 0.04 V. High H-coverage reconstructed surfaces have been discovered under acidic conditions, and the surface Ru sites introduced by additional Ru adatoms or exposed by P-vacancies serve as the active sites for HER based on their nearly reversible H binding. This work provides atomistic insights into the origin of high HER activity on RuP2 by exploring the dynamic surface phases of electrocatalysts and features a generalizable method to explore the reconstructed/hydrogenated surface space as a function of experimental conditions.    

    

## H2-Evolving Cobalt–Protic-NHC Catalysts: Kinetic Zone Diagram Analysis and Mechanistic Insights

A series of systematically designed cobalt–protic-NHC complexes containing pendant proton-shuttle groups was synthesized. The proton-shuttle motifs enabled these complexes to act as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from various acids as proton sources. The effect of acid strength on the mechanism of HER was investigated by varying the proton source ( CH3COOH, pKaCH3CN = 23.51), triethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Et3NHBF4, pKaCH3CN = 18.57), and trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH, pKaCH3CN = 12.70). Additionally, by changing experimental parameters such as substrate/catalyst concentration and scan rate, the single-electron EC′ zone diagram could be extended to the present multielectron reaction system where all of the zones were accessed with little deviation in some of the waveforms from the original. From the kinetic zone diagram analysis, some of the performance parameters such as the observed rate constant (kobs), turnover frequency (TOF), and the rate constant of the first chemical step (k1) were determined. Also, the zone diagram provided insight into the mechanistic cycle and the nature of the rate-limiting step. The investigation suggested that the protic proton of the proton-shuttle functionality triggered a hydrogen evolution reaction via intramolecular proton-hydride coupling from the Co(II)–H intermediate. This intramolecular dihydrogen elimination step, which was independent of the acid concentration, acted as the rate-limiting step and the turnover frequency of HER was fully controlled by this step.
