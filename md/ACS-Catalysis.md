Iridium-based electrocatalysts are the most promising candidates for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Considering their high cost and scarcity, it is imperative to maximize atom utilization and enhance the intrinsic activity of iridium. In this work, IrOx sub-2 nm clusters are stabilized on TiO2 supports via metal support interaction (MSI) induced by vacancy defects in TiO2. The strength of MSI is readily tuned by the type of vacancies: oxygen vacancies in TiO2 (VO-TiO2) induce the adsorbed MSI with relatively weak strength, while titanium vacancies in TiO2 (VTi-TiO2) lead to the strong embedded MSI. The tunable MSI further modulates the electronic structure of IrOx sub-2 nm clusters. IrOx/VO-TiO2 with adsorbed MSI exhibits an optimized electronic structure with a downshifted d-band center of IrOx, resulting in a reduced binding energy with oxygen and a low energy barrier of the rate-determining step for OER. Consequently, IrOx/VO-TiO2 delivers an activity twice that of commercial IrO2 and a good stability for 120 h in a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Our study provides a guideline for the rational design of acidic OER catalysts based on modulating the electronic structure of IrOx sub-2 nm clusters via tunable MSI.

Over the past decade, visible-light-mediated energy-transfer (EnT) catalysis, particularly triplet–triplet energy-transfer (TTEnT) catalysis, has emerged as a mild and environmentally friendly approach for diverse organic synthetic transformations. In contrast to photoredox catalysis, which typically requires sacrificial electron donors or acceptors to complete the catalytic cycle, EnT photocatalysis generally proceeds with high atom economy while minimizing the generation of wasteful byproducts. Furthermore, while successful photoredox catalysis is contingent upon the precise control of redox potentials of both photocatalysts and organic substrates, EnT strategies are primarily influenced by the triplet energy compatibility between these entities. Considering the growing importance of EnT photocatalysis, as well as hydrofunctionalization and difunctionalization reactions in organic synthesis, this review systematically summarizes significant advancements in EnT-enabled hydrofunctionalization and difunctionalization of unsaturated compounds via sigma-bond homolysis over the past decade. Special emphasis is placed on elucidating substrate scopes and mechanistic scenarios. Additionally, this review discusses versatile synthetic applications of these methodologies and addresses current challenges and opportunities within this evolving research field. This review is structured into six main categories based on different types of energy-transfer acceptors and the sigma-bonds undergoing homolysis. These categories include EnT-enabled hydrofunctionalization and difunctionalization transformations mediated by 1) N–O bond homolysis of oxime esters and other N,O-radical precursors; 2) N–S bond homolysis of N-sulfonyl imines and other N,S-radical precursors; 3) chalcogen–chalcogen bond homolysis of disulfides and oxy/thio/selenosulfonates; 4) C–S bond homolysis of tri/difluoromethylated sulfinates, acetylenic triflones, and arylsulfonium salts; 5) C–X (X = halogen) bond homolysis of organic halides; and 6) sigma-bond homolysis of other energy-transfer acceptors. Through providing theoretical backgrounds of EnT catalysis, along with a comprehensive overview of currently employed energy-transfer acceptors, photosensitizers, and contemporary strategies for EnT-induced hydrofunctionalization and difunctionalization of unsaturated compounds, this review aims to serve as an invaluable resource for future innovations in this rapidly evolving field.

Acetaldehyde is a toxic pollutant that can be detoxified by acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (ADAs) through its conversion to acetyl-CoA. This study developed an integrated approach combining virtual screening, rational design, and a dual scoring mechanism to identify and engineer hyperactive ADA variants. A library of 5000 Dickeya parazeae ADA (DpADA) homologues was created through protein BLAST, and deep learning tools predicted their Kcat values. The top 100 candidates were selected based on acetaldehyde binding affinity, evaluated through molecular docking and phylogenetic analysis. Among these, ADA6 from Buttiauxella sp. S04-F03 exhibited the highest activity, converting 57.6% of acetaldehyde to acetyl-CoA, which was 14.1 times higher than DpADA. To improve ADA6's thermostability, folding engineering was applied, resulting in the P443C variant with an 80.7% increase in residual activity after heat treatment. Molecular dynamics simulation pinpointed I440 as a bottleneck in the substrate tunnel, guiding the design of a dual-scoring system that integrates structural adjustments and electronic optimization to evaluate mutations for improved substrate exposure and activity. The final optimized variant, P443C-I440T, achieved a conversion efficiency of 93.2%. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining computational tools and rational mutagenesis to enhance enzyme activity and stability in enzyme engineering.

The development of highly active perovskite-based catalysts for the oxidation of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) has drawn a great deal of attention. A-site defect regulation is found to be effective to improve the catalytic performance, but the relationship between structure variation and catalytic activity has not been clearly unveiled. Herein, this issue was interpreted by the variation of physicochemical properties and electronic structure (O p-band center). An in situ one-step calcination method with NH4HCO3 addition was adopted to prepare a series of A-site-deficient LaCoO3 perovskites (LxCO), which were characterized by XRD, TEM, EELS, ESR, XPS, UPS, H2-TPR, and O2-TPD and catalytic test toward toluene oxidation. The catalytic activity displayed a volcano-type relationship with an addition amount of NH4HCO3. The electronic structure determined the reducibility and active oxygen content and accordingly affected the catalytic activity of LxCO. The obtained results provide theoretical and technical support for the design of efficient VOC oxidation catalysts.

The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is severely limited by the poor stability, low activity, and high cost of available catalysts. Enhancing intrinsic activity while maintaining stability and reducing reliance on precious metals is crucial. The typical adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) leads to high overpotentials and low activity, making the transition to alternative mechanisms, such as the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) or oxide path mechanism (OPM), highly desirable due to their lower overpotentials. Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with experimental validation to enhance the activity and stability of β-MnO2 via co-substitution with ruthenium (Ru) and iridium (Ir), enabling the transition from AEM to OPM. DFT calculations reveal that AEM is hindered by the weak nucleophilicity of water, while LOM suffers from high kinetic barriers due to structural distortions. In contrast, OPM demonstrates a significantly lower kinetic barrier, facilitated by the synergistic interaction between Ru and Ir. Experimentally, IrRuMnOx was synthesized through co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, showing an 80-fold improvement in mass activity and a 96-fold increase in stability compared to commercial IrO2, with minimal noble metal leaching, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). IrRuMnOx exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 475 mV at 1 A·cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 44.26 mV·dec–1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, maintaining stable performance for over 100 h. Moreover, the IrRuMnOx-based membrane electrode, with a low Ir loading of 0.075 mgIr·cm–2, achieved remarkable current densities of 1.0 A·cm–2 at 1.66 V and 2.0 A·cm–2 at 1.91 V at 80 °C. This performance surpasses that of both unsupported and conventional supported Ir-based catalysts at comparable Ir loading levels. This study offers critical insights into OER mechanisms in acidic media and paves the way for developing efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.

Hydroxylation of C25 C–H bonds (referring to sterols) is of great importance in vivo for metabolizing sterols and vitamin Ds. The biocatalytic hydroxylation of C25 C–H bonds is restricted by the selectivity and activity of the enzymes due to the inertness of these bulky compounds. Herein, we employed fungal unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) as the catalyst to develop efficient and selective AaeUPO variants through protein engineering. After three rounds of evolution using semirational design, 2 variants, G195A/G241V/G318V (Stev) and Q72K/G195A/G241V (Veco), were determined to be the ideal catalysts, showing a 25- to 27-fold increase in enzyme activity and an improvement in selectivity from 25% to over 93% in gram-scale conversion of vitamin D3 to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. These two variants exhibited overall enhanced catalytic performance in hydroxylating the C25 C–H bonds of the other 24 sterol and vitamin D analogues. This work provides an enzymatic toolbox to synthesize the highly important vitamins and sterols into the compounds of interest under mild conditions with remarkable regioselectivity and enzyme activity.

Despite the availability of numerous natural and engineered ene-reductases (ERs), enantiocomplementary synthesis of the sterically hindered molecules by ERs is still limited by poor substrate acceptance, particularly due to the insufficient complementary stereoselectivity. Herein, we reshaped the substrate-binding pocket of SeER from Saccharomyces eubayanus through semirational design, enabling ERs capable of stereocomplementary hydrogenating of the challenging substituted β-cyano cinnamic esters. Compared to the wild type, the variants exhibited enhanced activity (up to 161-fold) and catalytic efficiency kcat/KM (up to 358-fold), displaying potential in synthesizing various chiral β-cyano esters with high stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the key for the superior catalytic performance of variants is the well-tuned substrate-binding pocket, which strengthens and stabilizes substrate recognition. Furthermore, we elucidated the practicality of the SeER variants in asymmetric synthesis of the chiral GABA derivatives (e.g., Phenibut, Baclofen, and Tolibut) via chemo-enzymatic cascade reactions.
