The site-selective functionalization of carbon(sp3)–hydrogen bonds in saturated amines remains a persistent challenge owing to their intrinsic electronic deficiency, particularly in activating the α and β positions simultaneously for annulation reactions. Herein, we report a copper(I)-catalyzed dehydrogenation and [2 + 3] cycloaddition of commercially available amines with diaziridinone, which facilitated the direct synthesis of highly valuable imidazolidone derivatives. Operationally simple methodology has a broad substrate scope and convenient scalability, providing an effective and complementary platform for the rapid incorporation of N-heterocycles into amine molecules. Furthermore, comprehensive mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicated the pathway of the radical-type hydrogen atom transfer and [2 + 3] cycloaddition, which were promoted by a four-membered copper(III) species.

Nitrate ion is a common pollutant in surface and groundwater. Hence, its catalytic conversion into ammonia at ambient conditions by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical pathways is an attractive alternative to current ammonia production from the energy-intensive and high-carbon-featuring Haber-Bosch process. As such, developing highly active and product-selective catalysts with good durability and cost-effectiveness is highly desired. In this work, exfoliated MoS2-x is reported as a highly active and selective electrocatalyst and a photoelectrocatalyst for nitrate reduction to ammonia. Exfoliation via the acid treatment of bulk MoS2 results in exfoliated MoS2-x, which is only a few layers thick and has a high degree of sulfur vacancies (ca. 12−13%). Electrochemical studies and electrolysis product analysis reveal promising nitrate reduction activity, which is found to be highly enhanced by the application of visible light illumination. The exfoliated MoS2-x achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 69% with an ammonia yield rate of 5.56 mmol gcat–1 h–1 in the absence of a light source, which is enhanced to 80% with an ammonia yield of 7.48 mmol gcat–1 h–1 upon visible light illumination. DFT calculations support the binding of nitrate and other NOx species to the sulfur vacancies, resulting in the formation of *N, which is then reduced to ammonia.

Uridine/guanosine diphosphate-mannose (UDP/GDP-Man) is the major mannosyl donor in producing mannose-containing oligo/polysaccharides. Its acquisition is greatly limited by its complex and costly synthetic process, which requires multiple substrates and enzymes. The natural UDP/GDP-glucose 2-epimerase functioning C2 epimerization between UDP/GDP-Glc and UDP/GDP-Man remains unreported which is the main hurdle to realize concise production of UDP/GDP-Man. Here, the UDP-glucose 2-epimerase (Glc2E), which behaves like a naturally evolved enzyme, is created and exhibits high-efficient catalysis in producing UDP-Man. Multidimensional engineering, including redesigning the nucleobase recognition region, displacement of the substrate tunnel entrance, and expansion of space for sugar ring rotation, is employed to develop Glc2E from CDP-tyvelose 2-epimerase. Glc2E converts 55.63% of UDP-Glc to UDP-Man, a trace value for the initial enzyme, stTyvE, and its aptitude for GDP-Glc epimerization evolves from unobserved activity to 23.94% conversion. Coupling sucrose synthase with Glc2E achieves the theoretical synthase–epimerase route for UDP/GDP-Man production from inexpensive sucrose. The space-time-yield of UDP-Man is maximized to 8.05 g/L/h within 2.5 h, with a final titer of 22.54 g/L, demonstrating competitive application potential. Moreover, the GDP-Man is synthesized successfully at a titer of 3.49 g/L. Our work inspires the enzyme engineering for epimerases and glycosyltransferases that catalyze nucleotide sugars. The application of Glc2E in the synthase–epimerase route unlocks a concise and feasible synthetic approach for producing cost-competitive mannosyl donors.

## Shapeshifting Ligands Mask Lewis Acidity of Dicationic Palladium(II)

Supporting ligands limit the degree of electrophilic activation for any substrate because they also reduce the Lewis acidity of the transition metal ion. Here, we temporarily mask the Lewis acidity of dicationic Pd(II) by using "shapeshifting" bidentate pyrimidine/olefin ligands L1 and L2. These ligands delocalize/relocalize charge via reversible C–N bond formation. So, although ligated dicationic Pd compounds [1]2+ and [2]2+ appear charge separated (distributed across Pd and ligand), they react comparably to a solvated Pd(II) dication. Despite reacting like strong Lewis acids, the complexes are tolerant of polar functional groups (Lewis bases that often inhibit electrophilic catalysis). We propose that this property originates from the installation of a more nucleophilic (charge separated) state. This case study suggests that catalysts featuring reversible dynamics can be advantageous relative to their structurally static counterparts.

The effects of the electrical double layer (EDL), which pertain to the compositions and interactions among electrolyte species, significantly impact the catalytic process. There is a pressing need to investigate the role of electrolyte components and to deepen our understanding of EDL effects. In this study, we tune the water activity within a range of anionic surfactants featuring different functional groups to adjust H2 evolution activity and CO2 reduction selectivity. We demonstrate that these anionic surfactants are active in the local reaction environment under a cathodic potential. The enhanced selectivity of CO2 to CO can be attributed to the robust interfacial hydrogen-bonding network reformed by the anionic surfactants. This network diminishes the water dissociation activity and promotes the hydrogenation step in CO2 reduction. Notably, the electrolyte incorporating anionic surfactants improves the CO2 reduction performance, registering CO Faradaic efficiencies of 89.7% (RSO3–, SDS), 97.5% (RSO4–, SLS), 98.4% (RPO42–, SMP), and 98.9% (RCOO–, SL) at −1.2 V versus RHE, thereby outperforming the blank KHCO3 electrolyte (53.1%). This research underscores the crucial influence of anionic additives in the CO2RR.

Halloysite clay nanotubes (HNTs) are emerging nanomaterials for numerous environmental applications, including catalysis and biomass valorization. The efficacy of halloysite as a nanoplatform for the catalytic conversion of biomass can be accurately evaluated by combined approaches based on experimental investigations and computational modeling. Recently, many efforts have been made to properly describe the most peculiar features of halloysite by focusing on its structural and interfacial features through computational studies, which are challenging for natural clay nanoparticles yet crucial for the design of novel catalysts to be exploited in biomass conversion. Within this framework, this review critically and extensively discusses recent advancements related to the use of halloysite in different catalytic processes, such as enzymatic reactions, precious- and nonprecious-metal- and alloy-catalyzed reactions, and acid-activated mechanisms. The research gap on the computational modeling of biomass chemical conversion occurring on halloysite surfaces is highlighted throughout this review, together with the latest experimental achievements. To optimize the catalytic efficiency of halloysite-based materials for biomass valorization, future efforts should focus on the implementation of experimental data with calculations provided by proper models in a synergistic approach.

A catalytic protocol has been developed to access Fischer carbene nickel complexes using acylsilanes as stable and readily available precursors. The as-generated Fischer carbene complexes exhibit versatile reactivity, including cyclopropanation with alkenes, α-C–H insertion reactions, and two-component C–H addition to norbornene, which demonstrates the broad utility of the nickel(0)/acylsilane system for the catalytic applications of Fischer carbene complexes.

While alkenylborons have emerged as powerful precursors for the stereospecific construction of substituted alkenes, efficient synthetic methods toward stereodefined trisubstituted alkenylborons remain limited. Herein, we report a modular and practical approach for the stereoselective synthesis of E-trisubstituted alkenylborons through the nickel-catalyzed three-component reductive coupling of two readily available carbon electrophiles with an ethynyl-Bdan reagent. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing expedient access to a variety of trisubstituted alkenylborons with exclusive E-selectivity. The work demonstrates the possibility of applying ethynyl-Bdan as a type of boron reagent in organic synthesis.

## Insight into Roles of Rare-Earth Metals in Heterobimetallic Ni–Y Bifunctional Catalysis for Alkyne Semihydrogenation

Due to the unique properties of rare-earth (RE) metals, RE catalysts demonstrate distinctive catalytic performance in hydrogenation and related transformations. In typical RE catalytic systems, the roles and function modes have been studied and are relevant to ligands. In recent years, heterobimetallic catalytic systems have emerged for efficient hydrogenation and related transformations. Among these systems, heterobimetallic catalysts with transition metal (TM)-RE combinations integrate the characteristics of TM catalysis and RE catalysis, exhibiting a TM-RE bifunctional effect with remarkable activity and selectivity. However, the roles of RE metals in TM-RE bifunctional catalysis remain ambiguous. This theoretical study takes the Ni–Y system as a study case, aiming to elucidate the significant roles of the RE center in the TM-RE bifunctional effect on catalytic alkyne semihydrogenation. The results suggest that dynamic coordination can occur at the Y center due to its large size and coordination ability, which accepts the binding of phosphine groups of the ligand. The dynamic coordination of phosphine groups to the large-size RE center assists the Ni center in releasing vacant sites for substrate in-cage binding and reduces the steric effect on the Ni center. Meanwhile, the Lewis acidic RE center can stabilize the bridging hydride, which is crucial for H2 activation and hydrogenation. The TM-RE bifunctional effect promotes the reaction. During the H2 activation stage, due to the stabilization of nickel hydrides by yttrium, the fac-pathway is more favored. The Ni–H–Y bridging structure is maintained during the initial hydride insertion in the semihydrogenation stage, which is crucial for the reaction. Additionally, the use of the more active terminal hydride makes the terminal hydride pathway a more plausible mechanism. Benefiting from the capability of yttrium to accept the dynamic coordination of phosphine groups, thereby releasing steric hindrance and stabilizing the bridging hydride concurrently, (Z)/(E)-isomerization can proceed to achieve (E)-selectivity through the H2-assisted Ni–Y bifunctional pathway with a relatively low energy barrier. Owing to the RE-bridging hydride stabilization effect, the thermodynamic properties of intermediates are closely related to the size of the RE metal center, thereby influencing the activity and the (Z)/(E)-selectivity. These results underscore the important roles of the RE center in TM-RE bifunctional catalysis, offering valuable insights into the future design of effective bifunctional TM-RE catalysts.

5-Amino-1-pentanol (APO) is an important nitrogen-containing chemical with versatile applications. However, its synthesis is still not efficient. Here, we report the synthesis of APO from biomass-derived furfurylamine (FAM) via the direct cleavage of its α–C–O bond neighboring the −CH2NH2 group at ambient temperature. Pt/TiO2 catalysts exhibited high efficiency and stability in the FAM hydrogenolysis to APO, affording a high yield of 85.4% at 30 °C and 2.0 MPa of H2 in water. The high efficiency of Pt/TiO2 was found to be related to its superior activity for the cleavage of the α–C–O bond in FAM, relative to the hydrogenation of the furan ring on the corner and edge sites of the Pt surfaces. This work provides a viable approach for the precise cleavage of the α–C–O bond neighboring the −CH2NH2 group in the furan ring under mild conditions toward the efficient production of APO and its derivatives.

The catalytic hydrogen transfer (CHT) cascade reaction coupling alcohols with nitro compounds to synthesize imines is highly significant due to its remarkable efficiency and atom economy. However, the complicated multistep reaction process makes single-site catalysts exhibit unsatisfactory catalytic performance for the CHT cascade reaction. Herein, inspired by the findings of DFT calculations that Co nanocluster (CoNC) and Co single atom (CoSA) can act as the optimal active sites for alcohol oxidation and nitro reduction, respectively, one dual-active site catalyst (CoSA-CoNC/CN), containing CoSA and CoNC sites, was synthesized by a two-step vacuum pyrolysis strategy. Benefiting from the relay-like tandem catalysis of CoNC and CoSA, CoSA-CoNC/CN achieved an impressive 93% nitrobenzene conversion and 99% imine selectivity at 160 °C in 4 h, with a record turnover frequency of 20.9 h–1. This work provides insights into the functions of single-atom and nanocluster active sites in the CHT cascade reaction and sheds light on the rational preparation of tandem catalysts.
