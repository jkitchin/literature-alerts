The precise regulation of lattice oxygen is crucial for many redox reactions, but it still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile strategy to induce generation of bulk phase defects in hematite (α-Fe2O3) by ultrasonic treatment, thus achieving exclusive lattice oxygen activation without additional alternation of surface adsorbed oxygen species. This kind of unique lattice oxygen activation afforded negligible disturbance of NH3 adsorption but significant influence on NO2 generation via accelerated oxygen diffusion, resulting in enhanced activity contribution from the Fast-SCR reaction pathway. Particularly, the generation of bulk-phase defects was also found to be conducive to create thermally instable and chemically reactive surface nitrate species, which played a decisive role in activating NO reactant. Accordingly, a triple increment in the deNOx performance of the α-Fe2O3 catalyst for the reaction of selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 (NH3–SCR) was achieved.

The direct reductive functionalization of alkynes under mild conditions presents a promising yet challenging avenue for accessing value-added molecules. Alkyne radical anions represent a distinct class of reactive intermediates characterized by both a charge and an unpaired electron, thus holding great potential for facilitating diverse bond formations, particularly in alkyne reductive functionalization. However, the synthetic utility of alkyne radical anions is limited, primarily due to the difficulty in their generation and the formation of highly unstable vinyl radical intermediates. In this study, we accomplished the direct generation of alkyne radical anions from aryl alkyne feedstocks via single electron transfer (SET) reduction with photogenerated CO2 radical anion (CO2•–), enabling reductive hydroalkylation, arylalkenylation, and hydrocarboxylation of aryl alkynes. Our photocatalytic strategy features metal-free catalysis, mild reaction conditions, employment of a traceless reductant, good functional group compatibility, step- and atom-economy, and high regioselectivity. This study not only paves the way for leveraging the underexplored alkyne radical anions but also catalyzes the ongoing exploration of the bifunctional CO2•– species in synthetic chemistry.
