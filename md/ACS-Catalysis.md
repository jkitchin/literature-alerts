Unveiling the mechanism behind catalyst-dependent solvent effects for hydrogenation reactions is critically important yet presents significant challenges. In this work, focusing on furfural hydrogenation over Pd-based catalysts, we observe that distinct active hydrogen species present on Pd/MgO and Pd/TiO2 exhibit different responses to solvation environments, consequently influencing the selectivity in diverse solvents. Product distribution over Pd/MgO remains unaffected by the solvents used that tetrahydrofurfural (THFAL) emerged as the primary product in both organic solvents and water. Conversely, product distribution over Pd/TiO2 highly depends on the solvents; THFAL dominates in organic solvents, whereas furfural alcohol (FOL) becomes the primary product in water. The disparate selectivity upon alteration of supports and solvents is demonstrated by neural network-enhanced molecular dynamics simulations and microkinetic modeling. The active hydrogen species on the support are stabilized in water by water-mediated charge reconstructions, facilitating the hydrogenation of C═O to produce FOL. A spillover pathway where hydrogen species transfer to supports directly without involving hydrogen bond networks is dynamically preferred in both water and organic solvents.

The future of biomanufacturing is dependent on rewiring biological systems to establish an alternative approach to our current chemical industries. However, a key limitation in biomanufacturing is that desired processes must rely on the same two redox cofactors as natural metabolism, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) NAD(P)+, to shuttle electrons energy. Thus, competition of resources with natural reactions within host cells is nearly unavoidable. One strategy to overcome redox cofactor resource competition is the implementation of a third, noncanonical redox cofactor, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN+), which supports specific electron delivery to desired reactions. Here, we redesign the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDHc) to specially utilize NMN+ by engineering its E3 subunit (Lpd). Through rational design, we discover a cofactor promiscuous variant Lpd Penta (G182R-I186T-M206E-E205W-I271L) with an ∼2500-fold improvement in NMN+ apparent turnover number. We tailor the enzyme to exclusively use NMN+ through computational design and construct Lpd Ortho (Penta-R292E-Q317L) with a 2.4 × 105-fold cofactor specificity improvement toward NMN+ compared to the wild type. Molecular simulation allowed tracking of the cofactor's alternative binding poses that emerge as the enzyme evolves, which was crucial to precisely guide engineering. We demonstrate that the engineered NMN+-specific PDHc functions in E. coli cells to sustain the life-essential pyruvate metabolism, in an NMN+-dependent manner. These results expand the available NMN+ toolkit to include the high flux and nearly irreversible reaction of PDHc as an insulated electron source.

Anthropogenic activities have disrupted the natural nitrogen cycle, increasing the level of nitrogen contaminants in water. Nitrogen contaminants are harmful to humans and the environment. This motivates research on advanced and decarbonized treatment technologies that are capable of removing or valorizing nitrogen waste found in water. In this context, the electrocatalytic conversion of inorganic- and organic-based nitrogen compounds has emerged as an important approach that is capable of upconverting waste nitrogen into valuable compounds. This approach differs from state-of-the-art wastewater treatment, which primarily converts inorganic nitrogen to dinitrogen, and organic nitrogen is sent to landfills. Here, we review recent efforts related to electrocatalytic conversion of inorganic- and organic-based nitrogen waste. Specifically, we detail the role that electrocatalyst design (alloys, defects, morphology, and faceting) plays in the promotion of high-activity and high-selectivity electrocatalysts. We also discuss the impact of wastewater constituents. Finally, we discuss the critical product analyses required to ensure that the reported performance is accurate.

Due to the instability and weak O-nucleophilicity of enol, carbonyl compounds prefer to function as C-nucleophiles instead of O-nucleophiles in the extensively studied transition metal-catalyzed hydrofunctionalizations of unsaturated bonds. The corresponding hydroalkenoxylation reaction has thus long been unexplored. Here, we describe a chemodivergent protocol for the challenging hydroalkenoxylation reactions. Dictated by the Pd catalyst bearing different ligands, both 5-exo-trig and 6-endo-trig hydroalkenoxylation processes are demonstrated to be feasible between the reaction of 1,3-enynes and ketoesters, and polysubstituted hydrofurans and hydropyrans are achieved in good yields and excellent chemoselectivities. In addition, the enantioselective hydroalkenoxylation reaction is also explored under an Rh catalyst in moderate efficiency but with high stereoselectivities. Mechanistic studies corroborate the designed tandem hydroalkylation and hydroalkenoxylation processes and uncover that a ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfer process might be involved as the turnover-limiting step in the 5-exo-trig hydroalkenoxylation.

Precise design of photocatalysts with the demanded active surface structure for highly efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction is crucial but challenging. Here, by taking CdS as a prototype, single-atom Cu is successfully constructed on Cd-deficient CdS (Cd1–xS) to improve the performance of CO2 photoreduction with H2O as proton donor. The optimal Cu/Cd1–xS with Cd vacancies (VCd)-mediated single-atom Cu exhibits nearly 100% selective CO production and a more than three-fold higher CO evolution rate compared to that of Cd1–xS. Both experimental identification and DFT theoretical simulation unveil that the VCd-mediated single-atom Cu render Cu–S pair sites to function as more catalytically active sites for dissociating H2O and promoting the corresponding proton supply, which favors the subsequent protonation of the adsorbed CO2 at the adjacent Cd sites via the two-proton coupled two-electron transfer pathway. This work demonstrates the importance of modulating proton supply from the oxidation half-reaction for facilitating the overall CO2 photoreduction, advocating an overall-reaction perspective for the design and development of highly efficient and selective CO2 conversion photocatalysts.

Molecular volcano plots, which facilitate the rapid prediction of the activity and selectivity of prospective catalysts, have emerged as powerful tools for computational catalysis. Here, we integrate microkinetic modeling into the volcano plot framework to develop "microkinetic molecular volcano plots". The resulting unified computational framework allows the influence of important reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, and concentration, to be quickly incorporated and more complex situations, such as off-cycle resting states and coupled catalytic cycles, to be tackled. Compared to previous generations of molecular volcanoes, these microkinetic counterparts offer a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic behavior, in which selectivity and product ratios can be explicitly determined by tracking the evolution of each product concentration over time. This is demonstrated by examining two case studies, rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation and metal-catalyzed hydrosilylation, in which the unique insights provided by microkinetic modeling, as well as the ability to simultaneously screen catalysts and reaction conditions, are highlighted. To facilitate the construction of these plots/maps, we introduce mikimo, a Python program that seamlessly integrates with our previously developed automated volcano builder, volcanic.

The oriented conversion of C1 molecules including CO, CO2, CH4, and CH3OH has received great attention in the past few decades because of its essential role in sustainable chemistry. Spinel oxides with fine hardness, great thermal stability, and tunable chemical properties are advantageous catalysts or precursors in the activation of inert C1 molecules for the production of high-value-added chemicals. This review provides a thorough overview of the recent developments in spinel-structured nanocatalysts for the processes of thermal-driven C1 conversion, highlighting the spinel-structured advantages in deriving active metals, stabilizing metal cations, constructing adjacent synergic sites, and tuning oxygen vacancies. Finally, the potential challenges and development directions are discussed for the application of spinel-structured catalysts in thermal-driven C1 conversion reactions.

## Theoretical Exploration of the Origin of Alkaline Dependence in the Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural Catalyzed by NiO2Hx

Alkaline dependence is a common phenomenon in the electrochemical oxidation of biomass, and investigating the influence of alkalinity on the oxidation mechanisms is crucial for enhancing both the activity and the selectivity of biomass oxidation. Herein, we constructed five NiO2Hx catalysts under different alkaline environments (pH ≈ 9–13) and employed density functional theory methods to investigate the reaction mechanisms of the selective oxidation of the biomass platform molecule 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The origin of alkaline dependence in HMF electrochemical oxidation was analyzed, and the results indicate that the catalyst alkalinity determines the oxidation pathway of HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid: under weak alkalinity (pH ≈ 9–11), the adsorption and activation of the alcohol group in HMF are more favorable, resulting in preferential oxidation of the alcohol group; under strong alkalinity (pH ≈ 11–13), the aldehyde group of HMF is more prone to adsorb and activate on the catalyst surface, resulting in a predominant aldehyde oxidation. With the increase in the alkalinity of NiO2Hx, there is a decrease of H atom coverage and an increase in the valence state of Ni, resulting in a transformation in the preferential oxidation pathway of HMF from the alcohol group to the aldehyde group as well as a transition in the oxidation mechanism from direct oxidation to indirect oxidation. NiOOH under moderately alkaline environment effectively reduces the Gibbs free energy change for C–H/O–H bonds cleavage, lowering the reaction energy. It significantly enhances the oxidation ability of alcohol and aldehyde groups, exhibiting the highest catalytic performance in the conversion of HMF to FDCA. The study not only provide a comprehensive explanation for the alkaline dependence of HMF oxidation but also offer guidance on how to rationally design catalysts for improving oxidative performance through alkalinity adjustments.

Catalytic ammonia decomposition is an efficient way to produce clean hydrogen, but the design of ammonia decomposition catalysts is limited by the high cost of noble metals and the low activity. Herein, we report a CeO2/Ni inverse catalyst prepared by the coprecipitation method, exhibiting a high hydrogen production rate of 79.6 mmol gcat–1 min–1 at 500 °C, which is better than traditional supported Ni-based catalysts and even many of the Ru-based catalysts reported in the literature. In addition, this inverse catalyst showed catalytic stability for 100 h continuous reaction at 600 °C. Systematic catalyst characterizations revealed that the inverse CeO2/Ni catalyst exhibits small cerium oxide nanoparticle islands supported on the Ni nanoparticles. The inverse structure confers enhanced metal–support interaction and abundant Ni-CeO2 interface sites, which facilitate the generation of highly concentrated oxygen vacancies and abundant electron-rich Ni atoms at the interface under reduction conditions. These features endow the CeO2/Ni inverse configuration possessing increased number of adsorption sites for NH3 molecules, enhancing N–H bond breaking, and facilitating the recombination desorption of N and H adatoms, thereby accelerating the reaction rate. This work highlights the significance of constructing a rational configuration between the active metal nanoparticles and oxides to enhance the catalytic efficiency for NH3 decomposition.

Oxygen evolution catalysis fuels the planet through photosynthesis and is a primary means for hydrogen storage in energy technologies. Yet the detection of intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) central to the catalytic mechanism has been an ongoing challenge. This tutorial and minireview covers the relevance of ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of the electrochemical transformations of a metal-oxide surface undergoing OER. Here, we highlight the ultrafast trigger and probes of the electron-doped SrTiO3/electrolyte as the primary example in which light probes across the electromagnetic spectrum have detected intermediate forms. We compare the results to other early transition-metal-oxide surfaces when they exist for select probes and longer timescales. The first part covers how the catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the semiconducting depletion and electrolyte Helmholtz layers. The second part covers the detection of the intermediates that occur upon electron and proton transfer from an adsorbed water species by transient spectroscopy. Their detection by a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and a coherent acoustic wave respectively targets electronic states, vibrational levels, and lattice strain respectively. One of the aims is a tutorial on how these measurements are made and to what extent they allow for the interpretation of experimental spectra by intermediate configurations predicted by theory. Another aim is to describe what these experiments directly recommend in terms of future efforts to visualize the OER intermediates and their dynamics.

Oxygen vacancies (Ov) in reducible metal oxides are the vital active sites for methanol synthesis via a CO2 hydrogenation technology. However, the relationship between the density of Ov and the methanol synthesis performance is still ambiguous, and it still shows a lack of a versatile strategy to precisely tailor the number of Ov. In this study, with In2O3 as a representatively catalytic component, the density functional theory computation confirms that the Ov property, especially Ov density, is pivotal to enhancing methanol selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation by suppressing the undesirable reverse water–gas shift reaction for CO formation, which is attributed to the unique electronic density of In atoms around Ov. To verify the theoretical results, we report a protocol to optimize the concentration of Ov on In2O3 by sequential carbonization and oxidation (SCO) treatments of In-based metal–organic frameworks, during which the consumption of carbon species and the structural reconstruction of the In2O3 crystal regulated the particle size and Ov concentration of In2O3 by varying the oxidation temperature. The In2O3-5 catalyst carbonized and oxidized at 500 °C exhibits good methanol selectivity (72.3%) at a CO2 conversion of 9.9% under 330 °C, 3 MPa, and high space velocity of 12,000 L–1 kgcat–1 h–1. Multiple in situ characterizations clarify that the proposed Ov property regulating the SCO strategy is convenient to boost methanol synthesis by altering the CO2 hydrogenation process to the HCOO* intermediate-dominated pathway. Our work provides the catalyst design strategy and will shed light on the rational design of reducible metal oxide-based catalysts with a controllable Ov density.

Upgrading carbon dioxide (CO2) into multicarbon products by using renewable electricity provides a pathway to producing fuel and chemicals. In fact, input CO2 in alkaline and neutral reactors forms carbonates with hydroxide, resulting in lower carbon efficiency, so acidic electrolytes are considered as a strategy to solve this problem. However, hydrogen evolution reaction competition and lower Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the target product limit the development of acidic electrolytes. Here, we report an accessible composite catalyst of a commercial copper (Cu) powder modified by a small molecule 4,5-dicyanoimidazole (DCI) that can maintain a high FE for ethylene (C2H4) even in strong acids with pH ≤ 1. We achieve CO2 electroreduction on the DCI–Cu catalyst with an FE of 57% toward C2H4 at a current density of 200 mA cm–2 at pH 1. By in situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements, compressed bonding of the *CO intermediate has been observed, which leads to more C–C bonding. The density functional theory calculation results further prove that the adsorbed *CO intermediates on the DCI–Cu catalyst are closer to the reaction sites. Unfortunately, this catalyst still requires improvement in terms of long-term operation. However, we anticipate that this may be generalized to enable molecular strategies to complement metal-based catalysts designed for strong acidic conditions by stabilizing intermediates.

Here, we report mechanistic studies on type II thymidine kinase, Thermotoga maritima TmTK, aiming to predict barriers for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Extensive umbrella sampling QM/MM MD simulations (PBE/GPW/DZVP-GTH-PBE:AMBER) resulted in a free energy barrier for the phosphorylation reaction's rate-limiting step of 16.6 kcal·mol–1, which is in an excellent agreement with the experimentally reported value. An atomistic picture provided by our simulations reveals that the reaction follows a concerted, dissociative SN2 reaction mechanism in which the 5′-oxygen of the ribose moiety in thymidine is phosphorylated by the γ-phosphate of ATP, while assisted by an asynchronous deprotonation of the 5′-hydroxyl by a GLU84 base. The reaction was calculated to be endergonic, with a reaction free energy of 10.8 kcal·mol–1, and it can be followed by low-barrier processes that promote the unbinding of the phosphorylated thymidine product, namely, the deprotonation of the GLU84 by the thymidine-phosphate that is accompanied by a weaker binding of the product to the Mg2+ ion.

We addressed the challenges of designing catalysts for selective CO2 hydrogenation by incorporating Fe oxide species onto Rh nanoparticles. Nanoscopic FeOx domains created a "reverse catalyst" structure (i.e., a metal oxide supported on a metal) that increased the density of interfacial sites compared to traditional supported catalysts. The contact between the metal nanoparticle and the oxide overlayer induced the formation of a surface Rh–Fe alloy that stabilized methoxy groups while suppressing hydrogenolysis to methane. Sites at FeOx–metal interfaces interact with CO2 much stronger than sites on metal surfaces, show larger energy barriers to cleave the C–O bonds, and offer a barrierless pathway for the hydrogenation of methoxy species to methanol. Consequently, the multifunctional sites over FeOx/Rh–Fe catalysts highlight and meet the requirements of a selective methanol catalyst: strong interaction with CO2 to ensure a high density of transition states, metal sites to activate and make hydrogen available to surface intermediates, and high energy barriers for C–O bond cleavage to form carbides. These synthetic and catalytic chemistries, demonstrated for Rh–Fe–FeOx interfaces, enable us to overcome the limitations to the design of methanol production catalysts.

Hydrogenation of a normally highly stable carbonyl group is an important step in many technological applications, including emerging molecular systems for reversible hydrogen storage. In this report, we present a mechanistic study of low-temperature hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds over Pd, proceeding via keto–enol tautomerization in the first step. The specific focus of this study is on the role of subsurface hydrogen absorbed in the nearest region below the Pd surface. Employing a combination of real space microscopic and operando spectroscopic surface sensitive techniques, as well as molecular beams, we show that subsurface H plays a crucial role in both keto–enol tautomerization and hydrogenation of the carbonyl compound acetylpyridine on the Pd(111) model catalyst. We demonstrate that a growing amount of subsurface H results in an enhanced abundance of enol species followed by hydrogenation already at cryogenic temperatures. In contrast, if only H adsorbed on the surface is present, no hydrogenation occurs, and substantially smaller amounts of enol species are formed. The population of subsurface H is also accompanied by a change in the mechanism of enol stabilization via hydrogen bonding: while in the presence of subsurface H specific enol-containing dimers are predominately formed, which strongly interact via the enol-acetyl or enol–enol groups, in the absence of subsurface H, a weaker interaction between the adsorbates occurs, which is realized mainly via the enol group of one molecule with a H atom belonging to the pyridine ring of the neighboring adsorbate. The observed strongly correlated behavior between the growing concentration of subsurface H, enhanced abundance of the enol form of acetylpyridine, and the onset of hydrogenation prove the crucial role of subsurface H species in the low-barrier hydrogenation pathway of carbonyl compounds. The obtained atomistic-level insights offer a prospect of controllable low-temperature hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by tuning the abundance of subsurface H, which has not been available so far.

Due to their availability, low cost, and activity, cobalt-based catalysts are a promising alternative to platinum for the industrial propane dehydrogenation processes. However, their low stability due to sintering, phase transformation, and coke deposition leads to severe deactivation. In this work, the synthesis of amorphous, ordered mesoporous alumina with stabilized Co2+ nanoclusters (Co-m-Al2O3) via an evaporation-induced self-assembly synthesis route is presented. The ordered mesoporous alumina is characterized for containing a large amount of defective pentacoordinate Al3+ sites and a small amount of strong acid sites. The incorporation of Co2+ clusters within the m-Al2O3 structure enhances the dispersion and stability and preserves their reduction even after prolonged time on stream. This leads to a highly selective and steady catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction under industrial-relevant conditions. A significantly low deactivation rate of 0.53 d–1 with stable propylene selectivity of 95% is observed after 23 h, resulting in a 117% higher space–time yield toward propylene compared to the state-of-the-art impregnated Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, Co-m-Al2O3 leads to 4.6 times less coke formation, measured in situ for the first time. The detailed study of the nature of the cobalt sites, together with the acidic properties of the alumina supports, provides a deeper understanding of cobalt-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

The regio- and stereoselective hydroarylation of internal alkynes via transition-metal catalysis offers a direct approach for designing highly stereodefined multifunctionalized olefins. Through recognition of electronic bias, β-syn-hydroarylation of electronic poor alkynes with arylboronic acids has been well studied. However, from the same starting materials, achieving the opposite α-selective and highly anti-stereoselective hydroarylation remains a significant challenge due to these inherent biases. Therefore, an alternative synthetic pathway to trisubstituted alkenes with reversed positioning and configuration of substituents is highly desirable. Based on steric repulsion-induced regioselectivity and transient post-addition coordination-directed stereoselectivity, we report herein an α-hydroarylation method for phenylpropiolic esters using a nickel catalyst that promotes a formal anti-addition pathway. A broad range of organoboronic acids and phenylpropiolic acid derivatives are compatible with this hydroarylation protocol, offering an alternative selectivity to traditional β-syn-hydroarylation reactions. The distinct advantages of our method include precise control over selectivity, reduced catalyst loading, and broad tolerance toward functional groups. These features highlight the potential of our approach in the synthesis of multifunctionalized alkenes and in the late-stage modification of alkyne-based drug intermediates, showcasing its versatility and applicability in organic synthesis.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) shows potential for hydrogen production using cost-effective nonplatinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts, achieving high current density performance. However, challenges remain in developing materials, including stable membranes and ionomers under alkaline conditions and non-PGM catalysts that are both high-performing and durable for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study presents an approach for synthesizing highly crystalline carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticle networks using a polyphenolic tannic acid precursor and non-PGM NiFe metal cores, creating a durable OER catalyst. The simplified synthetic process introduces graphitic carbon layers (GCLs) to encompass the NiFe catalytic nanoparticles. Rigorous testing over 1100 h of continuous current operation demonstrates the stability of the catalysts, which is attributed to the robust interaction between the catalyst and the carbon support. The enhanced durability is further confirmed through theoretical calculations, showing greater resistance to corrosion in graphitic carbon compared to defective carbon. This study highlights the importance of highly crystalline carbon structures for achieving both high performance and durability in OER catalysts, which are vital for cost-effective AEMWE technologies. The findings contribute significantly to understanding the role of regulating carbon crystalline properties in developing efficient and durable non-PGM OER electrocatalysts.

Metal-catalyzed allenylic substitution reactions where allenes serve as electrophilic precursors have been recognized as a rapid way for novel allene construction. On the contrary, the chemistry in which allenes act as nucleophiles has been far less investigated, especially in a powerful platform such as metal-catalyzed allylic alkylation reactions. We herein describe two unprecedented palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation reactions of an allene nucleophile. In the first reaction, using vinyloxazolidinones as the allyl precursor, the palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylation of trisubstituted allenones worked well to prepare an array of axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that weak hydrogen-bonding interaction between the acidic C(sp2)–H of allenone and the nitrogen anion of chiral π-azaallyl-Pd species is key to the success of stereocontrol. This reaction revealed the intriguing reactivity of nucleophilic allenones in a metal-catalyzed asymmetric allylation reaction for the first time. In the second reaction, with the use of allenylethylene carbonates as π-oxyallyl-Pd precursors, the palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction of allenone presented unique reactivity under different reaction conditions to provide divergent synthetic access to (E)- and (Z)-allenyl diene products. Interestingly, the subsequent sequential intramolecular cyclization/isomerization reaction of the (Z)-product delivered dihydrooxepine derivatives as [5 + 2] annulation products.

Sequential excitation energy and electron transfer (ET) are ubiquitous pathways for converting solar energy to chemical energy in photosynthesis. Mimicking this unique process for chemical synthesis is promising yet still a big challenge. Herein, taking photosynthesis as an inspiration, we demonstrate an interesting pathway for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an important and valuable commodity chemical. The proposed route was verified on a biomimetic photocatalyst, i.e., an aluminum porphyrin metal–organic framework nanosheet (Al–TCPP). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the dioxygen molecule is first converted to a highly active singlet oxygen intermediate through an excitation energy transfer (EET) and then reduced to H2O2 via the photogenerated electrons with a reduced barrier over Al–TCPP. Consequently, Al–TCPP shows a 32 times higher H2O2 evolution rate than that of the pristine TCPP counterpart, wherein excitation energy transfer mainly exists. This study presents a paradigm to mimic the photosynthetic sequential excitation energy and electron-transfer process for improved synthesis of valuable commodity chemicals.

Selective hydrogenolysis of C–O bonds in biomass-derived oxygenated molecules is of great significance for the conversion of biomass to chemicals and fuels, especially for the inert C–O–C bonds in tetrahydrofuran rings. However, the lack of precise active sites results in the low activity of this reaction. In this work, the metal–support interfacial structure of the Ni–La2O3 catalyst was well-controlled by reducing LaNiO3 perovskite at different temperatures. During the reduction, the exsolution and segregation of Ni in the LaNiO3 perovskite led to the formation of metallic Ni nanoparticles and interfacial oxygen-vacant Ni2+-Ov-La3+ sites. Hydrogen spillover from Ni nanoparticles to the interface promoted the in situ generation of La–OH species under reaction conditions. At the same time, the oxygen vacancies at the interfacial Ni2+-Ov-La3+ sites can accommodate the spilled H, inducing the formation of the La–H species. The hydroxyl group in tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) interacted with La–OH through a metal alkoxide intermediate, which was subsequently hydrogenolyzed by the La–H to produce 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PeD). The intimate La–H and La–OH bifunctional sites on the metal–support interface have a strong synergistic effect, endowing the Ni–La2O3 catalyst with a high THFA hydrogenolysis activity. The proposed interfacial La–H assisted C–O bond hydrogenolysis provides an idea for the design of efficient hydrodeoxygenation catalysts for biomass upgrading.

The Z-scheme system, integrating an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) with a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP), is an ideal strategy for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS), in which the development of an efficient OEP remains a challenge. Herein, the GaN:ZnO photocatalyst was synthesized by an ammonium halide-based process to perform a recorded apparent quantum yield of 30% at 420 nm for oxygen evolution from water. It made the GaN:ZnO a remarkable OEP for the construction of three distinct Z-scheme OWS systems, including an unbiased-photoelectrochemical sheet, direct collision, and redox-ion-mediated electron shuttle. The features and parameters of each Z-scheme system were discussed in relation to water splitting, and the most efficient one was established by employing [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– as an electron shuttle and SrTiO3:Rh as an HEP. This work not only provides a methodology for synthesizing an efficient GaN:ZnO photocatalyst but also highlights its great potential as an OEP applicable to constructing various Z-scheme OWS systems.

The complex reaction network of catalytic biomass conversions often involves hundreds of surface intermediates and thousands of reaction steps, greatly hindering the rational design of metal catalysts for these conversions. Here, we present a framework of machine learning (ML)-accelerated first-principles studies for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of propanoic acid over transition metal surfaces. The microkinetic model (MKM) is initially parametrized by ML-predicted energies and iteratively improved by identifying the rate-determining species and steps (RDS), computing their energies by density functional theory (DFT), and reparameterizing the MKM until all the RDS are computed by DFT. The Gaussian process (GP) model performs significantly better than the linear ridge regression model for predicting both the adsorption free energies and transition state free energies. Parameterized with energies from the GP model, only 5–20% of the full reaction network has to be computed by DFT for the MKM to possess DFT-level accuracy for the TOF and dominant reaction pathway. While the linear ridge regression model performs worse than the GP model, its performance is greatly improved when only transition states are predicted by the regression model and adsorption energies are computed by DFT. Overall, we find that a high accuracy in adsorption free energies is more important for a reliable MKM than a high accuracy in TS free energies. Finally, based on the GP model with GOH and GCHCHCO as catalyst descriptors, we build two-dimensional volcano plots in activity and selectivity that can help design promising alloy catalysts for HDO reactions of organic acids.

The electrochemical oxidation of alcohols is being explored as a favorable substitute for the oxygen evolution reaction owing to its capability to generate high-value products and lower overpotentials. Herein, we present a systematic investigation into the electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a model biomass platform chemical, on a thin-film nickel catalyst, aiming to investigate the underlying reaction mechanism and shed light on the role of the catalyst's microenvironment and phase on activity and product selectivity. Utilizing a combined experimental and computational approach, we demonstrate that NiOOH is the active phase for HMF oxidation. Additionally, we find a substantial impact of the electrochemical environment, particularly the electrolyte pH, on the reaction. Under highly alkaline conditions (pH = 13), higher activity for HMF oxidation is observed, accompanied by an increased selectivity toward 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) production. Conversely, a less alkaline environment (pH = 11) results in diminished HMF oxidation activity and a higher preference for the partial oxidation product 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). Mechanistic insights from DFT studies reveal that geminal diols that are present under highly alkaline conditions undergo hydride transfer via HMFCA, while a shift to an alkoxide route occurs at a lower pH, favoring the DFF pathway. Hydride transfer energetics are also strongly affected by the surface Ni oxidation state. This integrated approach, bridging experimental and computational insights, provides a general framework for investigating the electrochemical oxidation of aldehydes and alcohols, thereby advancing rational design strategies in electrocatalysts for alcohol electro-oxidation reactions.

Replacing H2 with H2O as the hydrogen source for the water-involved selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol (WSHCC) is very attractive yet is underdeveloped by a much lower H2O conversion rate than H2. Here, we report the realization of a high-efficiency WSHCC process by a synergy of CO adsorption and H2O dissociation over a Au/α-MoC1–x boundary. It shows a specific molar rate of 60.86 mol molAu–1 h–1 to cinnamyl alcohol at 96 °C, which is nearly 12-fold that reported earlier, and maintains a high conversion of over 99% and a high selectivity of 77%. Mechanistic studies indicate that the Au/α-MoC1–x boundary accommodates atomically dispersed Auδ+ sites for adsorbing CO, vacating oxygen-covered α-MoC1–x and thereby creating isolated Mo sites for the preferred adsorption and hydrogenation of C═O bonds over that of C═C bonds. This provides a catalyst design strategy for high-efficiency C═O hydrogenation by water.

Controlling the location and microenvironment of active centers in the zeolite framework is critical for understanding the in-depth structure–performance relationships of catalytic systems and constructing highly efficient catalysts. Herein, we have developed an MOR-type titanosilicate (denoted as 6M-Ti-M360) with an extremely low framework Ti content (Si/Ti = 300), exhibiting not only ultrahigh catalyst weight-based conversion (81%) but also a record-breaking turnover number (TON = 5845) per Ti site in batchwise ammoximation of cyclohexanone. Its highly isolated and active Ti species took the specific position of defective T3 sites within the eight-member ring side pockets of the MOR topology, evidenced by molecular dimension-dependent shape-selective experiments and theoretical evaluation of the catalytic activation ability of the different crystallographic Ti sites at the molecular level. Despite an extremely low Ti content but with the most active Ti on the defective T3 sites, the 6M-Ti-M360 catalyst maintained the cyclohexanone conversion and cyclohexanone oxime selectivity both as high as 99% for a long lifetime (314 h) in a continuous slurry bed reactor, capable of producing 1100 kg of oxime per gram of Ti. The clarification of the location and local microenvironment of Ti active sites may provide new insights into the exploration and construction of highly active sites in zeolitic catalysts.

Molybdenum sulfides (MoSx) in both crystalline and amorphous forms are promising earth-abundant electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid. Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition was used to prepare thin films of both amorphous MoSx with adjustable S/Mo ratio (2.8–4.7) and crystalline MoS2 with tailored crystallinity, morphology, and electrical properties. All the amorphous MoSx films transform into highly HER-active amorphous MoS2 (overpotential 210–250 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4) after electrochemical activation at approximately −0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. However, the initial film stoichiometry affects the structure and consequently the HER activity and stability. The material changes occurring during activation are studied using ex situ and quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Possible structures of as-deposited and activated catalysts are proposed. In contrast to amorphous MoSx, no changes in the structure of crystalline MoS2 catalysts are observed. The overpotentials of the crystalline films range from 300 to 520 mV at 10 mA/cm2, being the lowest for the most defective catalysts. This work provides a practical method for deposition of tailored MoSx HER electrocatalysts as well as new insights into their activity and structure.

Acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis is a versatile enzyme, which catalyzes the transesterification of esters in aqueous media due to a kinetic preference of the synthesis reaction over the thermodynamically favored hydrolysis reaction. In the active octamer, the active site is deeply buried and connected to the protein surface by long and hydrophobic substrate access channels. The role of the access channel in controlling catalytic activity and substrate specificity was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov-state models, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of binding of acyl donors, acceptors, and water were compared. Despite the hydrophobic nature of the substrate access channel, water is present in the channel and competes with the acyl acceptors for access to the active site. The binding free energy profiles in the access channel and the flux of butyl and benzyl alcohol and vinyl acetate were analyzed in the concentration range between 10 and 500 mM and compared to water. The flux showed a maximum at an alcohol concentration of 50–100 mM, in agreement with experimental observations. At the maximum, the flux of alcohol approaches 50% of the flux of water, which explains the high transesterification rate as compared to hydrolysis. The molecular origin of this effect is due to the accumulation of alcohol molecules along the access channel. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of trajectories by a Markov-state model provided insights into the role of the access channel in activity and specificity by controlling access and binding of competing substrates.

The electrochemical coupling of biomass platform molecules to biofuels provides a promising method for addressing energy crises and environmental issues. However, achieving high yields of C–C coupling products under ambient conditions remains a challenge. Herein, we present a highly efficient electrocatalyst, [Cu(pz)]3[PW12O40] (Cu-PW12), fabricated by combining a Cu-pz complex (pz = pyrazine), a redox catalytic center, with Keggin-type PW12O40, and an electron sponge. Cu-PW12 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity for the electroreductive C–C coupling of furfural (FF), a bulk and low-cost biomass platform chemical, to produce a jet fuel precursor, hydrofuroin (HDF). Under neutral and ambient conditions, over 99% of FF is converted and the selectivity of HDF reaches 91.2%. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical studies, including control experiments, kinetic isotope studies, electrochemical and spectral analyses, and DFT calculations, reveal a synergistic catalysis effect between Cu center and PW12. The introduction of PW12 not only facilitates electron transfer, improving FF conversion, but also changes the rate-determining step, favoring the formation of HDF. Under turnover conditions, the Cu-PW12 catalyst is initially reduced and then FF is reduced by the Cu center to ketyl radical after protonation on the electrode surface. Finally, the self-coupling of two ketyl radicals in solution leads to the generation of HDF.

Selectivity control of supported metal catalysts, which are most widely utilized in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, is of great scientific significance to obtaining the desired chemical product in a multipath reaction but has remained a grand challenging issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation from CH4 to CO can be tuned by a robust and unique support doping strategy by changing the reduction activity of H species over M/Ce1–xPrxO2−δ (M = Ru, Rh) in which metal (M) nanoclusters showed the same existence form on differently doped ceria nanorod supports. The CH4 selectivity of the catalyst decreased with an increase in the Pr content in the support. The selectivity of CH4 on Ru/CeO2 was higher than 90%, while on Ru/Ce0.2Pr0.8O2−δ, the selectivity of CO reached 80%. A variety of techniques, including steady-state isotope transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) type in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)–mass spectrum (MS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), had been applied in this work to analyze the structure–activity relationship between the doping of Pr and the selectivity of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru sites were not directly involved in the hydrogenation of carbon-containing intermediate species (including bicarbonate and formate) during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The active H species on the support sites, which are incorporated in RE3+–OH, directly contacted and reacted with the carbon-containing intermediate species. The introduction of Pr in the support weakened the reducing ability of the support, thus decreasing the reducing ability of H species on the surface of the catalyst, which further hindered the conversion of formate into CH4, resulting in the declined CH4 selectivity. Our study clearly revealed the important role of support in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction and proposed a strategy to modulate the reaction selectivity via support doping. By changing the redox performance of the support, the activity of H species on the support can be adjusted. Thus, the conversion of important reaction intermediates (such as formate) can be affected, so as to achieve precise regulation of the reaction products. We have provided a broader perspective for the selective catalyst design of heterogeneous catalysis and the reaction mechanism study of supported metal catalysts.
