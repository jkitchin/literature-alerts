Exploring visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for photocatalytic lignocellulosic biomass-to-H2 conversion remains a glamorous but challenging goal because the photogenerated holes cannot directly transfer to biomass owing to the absence of a charge transfer channel. Herein, we design ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with abundant sulfur vacancy (VS-ZnIn2S4) as visible light responsive photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production from lignocellulosic biomass in the presence of MoS2 as the cocatalyst. In this smartly designed photocatalysts, the sulfur vacancy in ZnIn2S4 reduces the energy barrier of •OH generation reaction and results in the fast dynamics for the generation of •OH, which acts as the crucial species for the oxygenolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. As expected, the H2 generation rate of the optimized MoS2/VS-ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst in α-cellulose and bamboo powder aqueous solution achieves 1572 and 133 μmol·g–1·h–1, respectively. This study validates the feasibility of sulfur vacancy to boost visible light photocatalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into H2 fuel.

The biological formation of nitrogen–nitrogen (N–N) bonds represents intriguing reactions that have attracted much attention in the past decade. This interest has led to an increasing number of N–N bond-containing natural products (NPs) and related enzymes that catalyze their formation (referred to in this review as NNzymes) being elucidated and studied in greater detail. While more detailed information on the biosynthesis of N–N bond-containing NPs, which has only become available in recent years, provides an unprecedented source of biosynthetic enzymes, their potential for biocatalytic applications has been minimally explored. With this review, we aim not only to provide a comprehensive overview of both characterized NNzymes and hypothetical biocatalysts with putative N–N bond forming activity, but also to highlight the potential of NNzymes from a biocatalytic perspective. We also present and compare conventional synthetic approaches to linear and cyclic hydrazines, hydrazides, diazo- and nitroso-groups, triazenes, and triazoles to allow comparison with enzymatic routes via NNzymes to these N–N bond-containing functional groups. Moreover, the biosynthetic pathways as well as the diversity and reaction mechanisms of NNzymes are presented according to the direct functional groups currently accessible to these enzymes.

Buchwald–Hartwig (BH) aminations are crucial for synthesizing arylamine motifs in numerous bioactive molecules and fine chemicals. While homogeneous palladium complexes can be effective catalysts, their high costs and environmental impact motivate the search for alternative approaches. Heterogeneous palladium single-atom catalysts (SAC) offer promising recoverable alternatives in C–C cross-couplings. Yet their use in C–N couplings remains unexplored, and mechanistic insights into amine coupling with aryl halides over solid surfaces that could guide catalyst design are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that palladium atoms coordinated to well-defined heptazinic cavities of graphitic carbon nitride (Pd1@C3N4) deliver practically relevant yields for BH couplings across various aryl halides and amines, exhibiting persistent activity and negligible leaching over several cycles. Notably, Pd1@C3N4 shows comparable or superior activity with certain aryl chlorides to bromides, alongside high chemoselectivity for amines over amides. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses supported by density functional theory simulations identify the concerted role of the ligand and the C3N4 host in determining the performance, with a Pd(II) nominal oxidation state observed under all coupling conditions. Complementary structural and kinetic studies highlight a distinct reaction mechanism than that typically reported for homogeneous catalysts. These findings offer key insights for designing recyclable SAC for BH coupling, setting the basis for extending the scope toward more complex industrial targets.

Iron plays a central and critical role in the water oxidation mechanism and the activity of transition-metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides. Tracking Fe dynamics (deposition/dissolution/electrolyte transport) and unraveling the chemistries of various Fe active sites under oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) conditions are important for catalyst design, particularly for applications in alkaline electrolysis. Here, we use CoOxHy thin films as a platform to investigate Fe transport and reactivity at the catalyst-electrolyte interface and its impact on OER activity. We find that the deposition/dissolution of the surface-absorbed Fe species is governed by the transport of soluble Fe species and applied potential. Soluble Fe species in the electrolyte adsorb on CoOxHy under stirred electrolyte conditions. Accelerated Fe desorption is observed with a more-positive OER potential. The surface-localized Fe sites generated by absorption from soluble Fe species have a higher OER turnover frequency (TOFFe) compared to Fe in codeposited CoFeOxHy films. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows structural similarity between reference Fe oxyhydroxides and surface Fe sites on CoOxHy, contrasting with Fe sites within the CoOxHy structure made by codeposition, where Fe shows a different apparent X-ray absorption edge energy. The OER activity of the surface-absorbed Fe decreased by Fe desorption but was recoverable by redepositing Fe species under non-OER conditions.

Aryl aldehydes are key synthetic intermediates in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients. They are generated on scale (>1000 kg) through the palladium-catalyzed formylation of aryl bromides using syngas (CO/H2). The best-in-class catalyst system for this reaction employs di-1-adamantyl-n-butylphosphine (cataCXium A), palladium(II) acetate, and tetramethylethylenediamine. Despite nearly 20 years since its initial report, a mechanistic understanding of this system remains incomplete. Here, we use automation, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations to develop a mechanistic model for this best-in-class catalyst. We suggest that a combination of the migratory insertion step and dihydrogen activation step is likely involved in the turnover-limiting sequence. The reaction kinetics are responsive to the nature of the substrate, with electron-rich aryl bromides reacting faster and more selectively than their electron-poor counterparts due to the influence of electronics in the migratory insertion step. Our findings add additional insight into the proposed mechanism of palladium-catalyzed formylation of aryl bromides.

A Ni-catalyzed enantioconvergent cross-coupling between β-bromostyrenes and secondary Grignard reagents is reported. This C(sp2)–C(sp3) cross-coupling is applicable to a broad range of electrophilic and nucleophilic partners and affords the products in good to high levels of enantio-induction. Experimental mechanistic investigations revealed an unexpected binding mode of the chiral (P,N) ligand and support a radical rebound mechanism involving in-cage radicals. Kinetic experiments provide evidence for an off-cycle resting state featuring dinuclear species. Computational analyses are in line with this hypothesis and coherent with a catalytic cycle proceeding via a Ni(I)/Ni(III) manifold. They further suggest an enantio-determining radical capture event and shed light on the origin of the Dynamic Kinetic Resolution process.

Hydrothermal stability is a vital performance criterion considered in the design of heterogeneous metal catalysts for practical applications because of the widespread presence of moisture in the reaction feeds or the products. In this work, we substantially promote the hydrothermal stability of the Pt-zeolite catalyst by incorporating Sn into the zeolite framework. Pt species are stabilized as small nanoparticles, and the MFI zeolite structure is well preserved even after hydrothermal treatment at 850 °C in a mixed atmosphere (CO + O2 + H2O). Adding Sn into Pt-MFI not only heals the defect sites in pure-silica MFI zeolite to promote its structural stability during hydrothermal treatment but also stabilizes the mobile PtOx species via the Sn–O–Pt interaction. The remarkably high stability of the Pt particles encapsulated in the Sn-promoted MFI zeolite is reflected in the CO oxidation reaction in which Pt particles stabilized in the Sn-promoted MFI zeolite exhibit much higher stability than the nonpromoted Pt-MFI catalyst. The stabilization effect of Sn is further extended to a Pd-MFI zeolite catalyst in which the average size of the Pd particles remains below 2 nm after the harsh hydrothermal treatments at 850 °C.

The reaction microenvironment plays a key role in dictating the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, understanding the chemical nature of this microenvironment under operating conditions remains a substantial challenge. We employed attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) in operando for simultaneous measurements of reaction kinetics and concentrations of reactants and intermediates at the reaction interface, all under controlled mass transport conditions. These operando measurements enable direct correlations between the reaction microenvironment, mass transport, and kinetics for a Cu electrocatalyst, such as higher local concentrations of CO2 under faster mass transport corresponding to higher rates of CO2 reduction. We observed that faster mass transport decreased the *CO coverage at less negative potentials (−0.6 VRHE) and increased the *CO coverage at more negative potentials (−1.1 VRHE). We developed a transport-coupled kinetic model that captures these spectroscopic observations and provides insight into the processes controlling interfacial concentrations of reactants and intermediates, aiding future efforts toward tailoring reaction microenvironments.

Manganese oxides have emerged as promising catalysts for the low-temperature activation of molecular oxygen (O2), crucial for the catalytic oxidation and removal of gaseous pollutants. However, the undesired Jahn–Teller (J-T) effects associated with the Mniv/Mniii redox couple, particularly under SO2 poisoning, led to the effectiveness of Mn oxides in applications. Herein, we construct a highly covalent Seiv-O-Mniii structure via the introduction of selenium into α-MnO2. Such a structure features high-valence Seiv anchored on the oxygen-terminated (110) plane of α-MnO2, facilitates the generation of more active oxygen species, and maintains the continuous cycling of oxygen-linked Mniv/Mniii. Such dynamics are pivotal for stabilizing manganese activation and mitigating the J-T effect. Through a combination of experimental investigations and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the Seiv-O-Mniii configuration, characterized by a high degree of Mn–O hybridization, significantly enhances CO oxidation, NH3 oxidation, and elemental mercury (Hg0) removal performances, and exhibits resistance to SO2. This study paves the way for the development of efficient low-temperature O2 activation processes for the removal of gaseous pollutants in real-world applications.

Adsorbates can trigger surface reconstruction on metal surfaces, a common yet highly important phenomenon in heterogeneous catalysis that has not been fully explored. Here, we develop a reliable Cu–C–O machine learning force field (MLFF) with ab initio accuracy, providing insights into the reconstruction mechanism and distribution of active sites on the Cu surface under a CO atmosphere through state-of-the-art deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD). Combining statistical cluster analysis with microkinetic modeling, we establish a strategy to quantitatively assess the turnover frequency (TOF) of catalyst surfaces during the dynamic catalytic process. Our findings reveal that edge Cu atoms undergo rearrangement, ejection, diffusion, and aggregation under a CO atmosphere, leading to the formation of cluster active sites. These small clusters in dynamic equilibrium are identified as the origin of the high catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts for a low-temperature water–gas shift reaction (WGSR). This work not only elucidates intrinsic activity in metal catalysis and the dynamic catalysis theory but also offers valuable insights for computational catalysis methods to identify effective catalysts for practical applications.

Despite the widespread use of hexafluoropropanol (HFIP) as a "magic" solvent or additive in organic synthesis, its fundamental mechanisms lag far behind. This study presents mechanistic insights into the puzzling alcohol additive effects observed in Ishihara's conformationally flexible C2-symmetric iodoarene-catalyzed asymmetric phenolic dearomatization through density functional theory calculations. The results reveal that due to the "booster effect" of fluorinated alcohols, HFIP assembles a trimeric hydrogen bond cluster that displaces a ligand from the active iodine(III) catalyst and forms a low-barrier hydrogen bond with the substrate, which significantly enhances the oxidizing power of the iodine(III) center, thus facilitating the dearomatization of electron-deficient phenols. Conversely, methanol is found to promote the dearomatization of electron-rich phenols via a formally similar yet distinct mechanism, thus highlighting the unique role of HFIP as an additive. The insights gained from this investigation advance our molecular-level understanding of the synergistic interactions between catalysts and additives, potentially guiding the design of catalytic systems that exploit these effects for broader applications.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is of great importance to produce valuable chemicals. In conventional alkaline and "acid + salts"-based CO2RR, the aqueous electrolyte normally needs to be refreshed due to the gradually more neutral feature of pH during electrolysis operation. Therefore, both solutes and deionized (DI) water in electrolytes are required to be regenerated regularly. In this work, acidic seawater (pH < 2) was used as a low-cost but efficient electrolyte for CO2RR without salt addition. The Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and partial current densities of C2+ on typical copper in the "H2SO4 in raw seawater" electrolyte are comparable with those for conventional "KOH in DI water" and much higher than those for "H2SO4 + salts" systems. Moreover, single-pass carbon efficiencies (SPCEs) in acidic seawater are significantly higher than the values in alkaline DI water. Such an abnormal phenomenon was also demonstrated for CO and HCOOH generation on typical silver and tin catalysts, respectively. In situ Raman spectroscopy and controlled experiments revealed that metal (denoted as M) cations in seawater ensure a higher concentration of M·H2O species, which improve interactions with *CO2–, while Cl– anions enhance the adsorption strength of key CO2RR intermediates (namely, *CO on copper, *COO– on silver, and *OCHO on tin). Through these interactions with water molecules and CO2RR intermediates, such free but functional ions in seawater play a highly important role in promoting selectivity and activity for CO2RR, as well as SPCE in acidic seawater. Furthermore, using acidic seawater as an alternative CO2RR electrolyte has significant economic and ecological benefits compared with traditional alkaline DI water electrolytes.

Electrochemical C–N coupling between CO2 and N-containing small molecules is a promising strategy to close both the carbon and nitrogen loops to support the establishment of a net-zero carbon economy. However, the intricate reaction network and the contentious C–N coupling mechanism hinder the development of efficient electrocatalysts for industrial applications. Herein, we develop a graph-based approach to enable autonomous analysis of the C–N coupling mechanism for coreduction of CO2 and NO3– on single-atom catalysts (SACs). 1400 potential intermediates and 2490 C–N coupling modes are investigated based on the Cu-N4-C prototypical catalyst. We demonstrate that N-containing species with a higher reduction degree are more likely to undergo C–N coupling and the initial coupling of the C–N bond tends to occur on CO2. It is revealed that the hydrogenation energies of *NH2 and CO2, as well as their coupling energies, can serve as key indicators for catalyst recommendation. Using this approach, SACs with Mo, W, or Sb metal centers are identified as promising electrocatalysts for C–N coupling. This work presents a paradigm for automatically exploring the mechanisms of complex electrocatalytic reactions and offers a strategy for predicting highly active and selective SACs.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile class of materials that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. A growing number of studies aim to identify potential new SACs or to describe their structure and reactivity through ab initio quantum chemical simulations. While many computational studies primarily address reactions involving small molecules, such as water splitting or CO2 reduction, the application scope of SACs is rapidly broadening to include the production of fine chemicals and the conversion of biomass-derived platform molecules, processes that involve larger, more complex reactants. Using density-functional theory (DFT) simulations, we demonstrate that, while an approximate treatment of entropy is acceptable for molecules with up to three atoms, it introduces substantial errors in reactions involving more complex molecules. Our results reveal a linear correlation between the entropy of adsorbed molecules and that of the corresponding isolated species, mirroring trends observed on extended catalytic surfaces. For the largest systems investigated in this study, the entropy of the free molecule is reduced by approximately 10–20% upon adsorption; for small molecules, this reduction can range from 50 to 70%. This disparity arises because, on SACs, the translational entropy is effectively zero, the rotational entropy is minimal, and the vibrational entropy increases with the size of the molecule. Moreover, the entropy of adsorbates scales linearly with the number of atoms in the molecule, allowing for the prediction of entropic contributions of adsorbates on SACs without additional computational cost. Using propyne hydrogenation as a test, we demonstrate that the reaction energy profile computed with current approximate approaches for estimating the entropy of adsorbates differs significantly from the profile where entropy is explicitly included. These findings highlight the importance of considering adsorbate entropy for accurately predicting the catalytic activity of SACs, particularly for reactions involving complex molecules.

Arsinothricin (AST) is a broad-spectrum arsenic-containing antibiotic with promising pharmaceutical properties. In this study, we report the one-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis of AST starting from methylarsenate, a commonly used agricultural herbicide. Although a single point mutation in the C-terminal region of ArsL completely abolished its activity toward the natural substrate inorganic arsenite, this mutation unexpectedly enhanced its activity toward methylarsenate by over 50-fold, enabling subgram scale production of AST in a cell-free system. These findings offer valuable mechanistic insights into ArsL and highlight the significant potential of manipulating the radical SAM superfamily enzymes in synthetic applications.

Oxidative homocoupling of arenes is a challenging but attractive method for converting nonactivated aromatics into biaryl compounds. Applications and the mechanistic understanding of bimetallic nanocatalysts for arene C–H bond activation are limited at present. In this study, we found that a Pd–Ru bimetallic catalyst supported on Al2O3 showed remarkably high catalytic activity for the oxidative homocoupling of arenes owing to the synergistic effect between Pd and Ru. Structural analyses by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the Pd nanoparticles were decorated by partially oxidized Ru clusters. Mechanistic studies indicated that the arene C–H bond cleavage was the rate-determining step and proceeded by a concerted metalation–deprotonation mechanism. It was proposed that the role of Ru is promoting the C–H activation step by generating electron-deficient Pd sites, which was supported by DFT calculations. The Ru-decorated Pd nanoparticles showed large turnover numbers for simple arenes.

The orbital hybridization between metal and oxygen of perovskite catalysts can lower the overpotential and enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. This study combines density functional theory with experiments to clarify how Sr/Fe codoping modulates orbital hybridization and enhances OER catalytic activity of LaCoO3. The as-prepared La0.50Sr0.50Co0.75Fe0.25O3 shows remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm–2 current density and a 107.03 mV dec–1 Tafel slope, outperforming most state-of-the-art perovskite-based OER electrocatalysts. The experimental results confirm that Sr/Fe codoping enhances the expansion of Co–O–Co bond angles and strengthens the covalency of the Co–O bond in LaCoO3, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, increasing Sr doping reduces the distance between the Co 3d/O 2p center and the Fermi level, decreasing the energy difference between them and enhancing the degree of orbital hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p. As the degree of Co 3d/O 2p orbital hybridization increases, a higher charge transfer was found between the active center and intermediate product, OOH, reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step while lowering the overpotential. This study provides thorough insight into the rational design of OER catalysts based on orbital hybridization.

A catalytic asymmetric intermolecular benzylic C–H amination was achieved under paddle-wheel diruthenium catalysis. A chiral diruthenium catalyst incorporating (S)-TPPTTL (tetraphenylphthaloyl-(S)-tert-leucine) ligand exhibited notable enantioselectivity, and aminated products were obtained with up to 99% ee. Unique chemoselectivity of the chiral diruthenium catalyst was also found for allylbenzene and alkyl-naphthalene substrates, demonstrating the complementary synthetic utility of chiral paddle-wheel Ru(II)–Ru(III) catalysts to Rh(II) counterparts.

Organohalides are crucial in modern organic synthesis, thanks to their robust and versatile reactivity in cross-coupling and other key transformations. However, catalytic asymmetric methods for producing enantioenriched organohalides, particularly axially chiral vinyl halides, remain underdeveloped. Here, we present a Cu(I)-catalyzed, highly enantioselective radical alkyne 1,2-halofunctionalization, utilizing custom-designed tridentate anionic N,N,N-ligands with bulky peripheral substituents. This method efficiently employs (hetero)aryl and alkyl sulfonyl chlorides, as well as α-carbonyl alkyl bromides, as radical precursors and utilizes a diverse range of 2-amino and 2-oxy aryl terminal alkynes as substrates to produce highly enantioenriched axially chiral vinyl halides. The reaction is scalable to gram quantities, and the vinyl halides can be further transformed into axially chiral thiourea, pyridyl carboxamide, and quinolyl sulfonamide compounds, some of which show significant potential in asymmetric catalysis. Both experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies support an enantioselective halogen atom transfer mechanism. This method opens an avenue for accessing axially chiral organohalides, facilitating their broad applications in various related fields.

Herein, we demonstrate a one-pot sol–gel-assisted procedure to prepare a defect-rich Li2WO4/Mg6MnO8 catalyst having surface oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the adsorption of O2 molecules to generate active oxygen species (O2–, O22–) by incorporating Li and W into the Mg6MnO8 lattice. These active oxygen species serve as primary active sites, selectively dissociating CH4 into CH3• and promoting CH3• coupling into C2H6, while hindering excessive oxidation of CH3• into COx. Various analytical methods such as XPS, O2-TPD, EPR, CH4-TPSR, in situ DRIFTS, and in situ Raman spectroscopy studies demonstrated that surface reactive oxygen species are more active and selective than lattice oxygen toward the formation of C2 products. The controlled addition of Li and W plays a crucial role in stabilizing surface Li species through the formation of Li–O–W bonds by forming the Li2WO4 phase, ensuring stable catalyst performance up to 100 h. DOS analysis shows a positive shift in the p-band center, which effectively promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies. Analytical studies confirmed that surface active oxygen species are more active and selective than lattice oxygen in forming C2 hydrocarbons. The Li2WO4/Mg6MnO8 catalyst exhibited superior performance, achieving ∼82% C2 selectivity and ∼25% C2 yield at 700 °C. We found that the stable formation of active oxygen species (O2–) and a high Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio over the surface are the key factors for achieving high C2 selectivity and yield during OCM. DFT results show that the concentration of oxygen defect sites is higher on the surface of the Li2WO4/Mg6MnO8 catalyst, which synergistically binds Li2WO4 and Mg6MnO8, in comparison with pure Mg6MnO8 surfaces. Furthermore, DFT calculations also indicate that oxygen vacancies are energetically more favorable on the surface of the Li2WO4/Mg6MnO8 catalyst rather than in its subsurface. In situ XRD and in situ Raman analysis demonstrated that Li2WO4 undergoes a reversible phase change, transitioning into a molten state at higher temperatures, potentially forming Li2O2 species that may serve as active centers during the reaction.

Regioselective C–H functionalization of fatty acids and alcohols is a challenging reaction, especially in-chain/midchain hydroxylation. These hydroxy fatty acids or diols offer a synthetic route to valuable δ- and γ-lactones. Although terminal and subterminal hydroxylation of fatty acids and alcohols by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases have been extensively explored, the molecular determinants of in-chain hydroxylation are unknown. Here we performed ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) of the subfamily of CYP505Es, able to perform in-chain hydroxylation, together with their closest related subterminal hydroxylases. Three ancestors were resurrected, which represented the in-chain and subterminal hydroxylases, as well as their common ancestor, which displayed little regioselectivity. Mutations were introduced to investigate the divergence in regioselectivity observed in the natural evolution. Whereas subterminal hydroxylation appears to be through multiple additive mutations in the active site, in-chain hydroxylation was greatly affected by the BC-loop. ASR provides not only insight for directed evolution studies but also more promiscuous ancestors as templates for the starting point for laboratory evolution.

Rare-earth-promoted zeolites have broad applications in the petrochemical industry because modifying zeolites with rare-earth elements can remarkably improve hydrothermal stability and tune the physicochemical properties of the acid sites, resulting in substantial promotion in catalytic selectivity and long-term stability. However, for a specific reaction, it remains a challenge to elaborate the coordination environment of rare-earth elements within the zeolite structure and establish the structure–reactivity of rare-earth-promoted zeolite catalysts. In this work, we have employed multiple spectroscopy and electron microscopy techniques to elucidate the spatial location and coordination environment of atomically dispersed La species in MCM-22 concertedly. In particular, we have attempted to clarify the variation of the chemical nature of the acid sites in MCM-22 zeolite in response to the introduction of La promotor. By appropriately controlling the spatial distribution and chemical nature of the acid sites, we have obtained a La-modified MCM-22 catalyst with high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability (>800 h) for alkylation of 2-methylnaphthalene with methanol for the production of 2,6-dimethyl-naphthalene under industrially relevant conditions.
