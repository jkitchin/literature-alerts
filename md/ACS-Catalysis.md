SOZ2– (Z = 3–4)-functionalized metal vanadates vary with the type of metal cations (Mn+) for the Mn+-O2–-V5+ channels that fragment to impart Brönsted acidic bonds (BA–-H+; SOZ2–-H+) and labile/mobile oxygens (OL/OM) with distinct populations and affinities for NOX/O2/H2O/SO2. SOZ2–-modified Mn+-O2–-V5+ fragments bind with NH3 to activate Eley–Rideal (ER)-type selective catalytic NOX reduction (SCR), yet, hardly enable OL coordination with NOX and are often hydrophilic, thereby limiting the activities of SCR or ammonium (bi)sulfate (AS/ABS) fragmentation, as gauged by the NOX consumption (-rNOX) and AS/ABS degradation rates (-rAS/ABS), respectively. Here, we justified the use of nonreducible La3+-containing La3+-O2–-V5+ channels, whose merits in accelerating SCR and AS/ABS fragmentation were found to be more pronounced for SOZ2–-modified LaV3O9 (LaV3O9-S) than for conventional/polymorphic LaVO4 analogues (LaVO4-S). Besides activating the ER-type SCR, LaV3O9-S bound with NO and activated Langmuir–Hinshelwood-type SCR, as opposed to LaVO4-S. The pre-exponential factor (k′APP,0) and -rNOX were thus higher for LaV3O9-S than for LaVO4-S and were coupled with the greater amount of OM in the former, leading to superior SCR performance under wet gases. Moreover, compared to LaV3O9-S, its Sb2O5-promoted analogue (LaV3O9-Sb2O5-S) provided a larger number of NH3-accessible BA–-H+ bonds to achieve higher k′APP,0/-rNOX alongside higher OM mobility. Furthermore, the LaV3O9-S and Sb2O5-S of LaV3O9-Sb2O5-S elevated the hydrophobicity and number of ABS-accessible BA–-H+ bonds, respectively. LaV3O9-Sb2O5-S thus revealed a lower energy barrier and higher k′APP,0 in AS/ABS pyrolysis than a commercial control (V2O5-WO3-S), resulting in a higher -rAS/ABS for the former. Consequently, LaV3O9-Sb2O5-S displayed superior SCR performance and greater hydrothermal resistance under SO2-containing wet gases in comparison with V2O5-WO3-S.

Nowadays, the assembling of hybrid water electrolysis using a hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) instead of a slow anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been established as a favorable technology for efficient hydrogen (H2) production. Nevertheless, it is still critical to develop highly effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR. In this work, we propose a facile approach for the design and synthesis of single-Pd-nanoparticles-decorated bimetallic NiCo2O4 nanoplates as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and HzOR. Initially, the NiCo2O4 nanoplates are synthesized by a combination of hydrothermal reaction and high-temperature calcination. Subsequently, single-Pd nanoparticles with varying proportions are decorated on NiCo2O4 nanoplates via facile pulsed laser irradiation (PLI), leading to the formation of Pd/NiCo2O4 composites. The optimized Pd/NiCo2O4 composite shows a remarkable electrocatalytic ability with a low overpotential of 294 mV for the HER and an ultrasmall working potential of −6 mV (vs RHE) for the HzOR at 10 mA cm–2 in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Thus, an overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer with the Pd/NiCo2O4∥Pd/NiCo2O4 system presents the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm–2 at respective low cell voltages of 0.35 and 0.94 V. Notably, in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy confirms the surface formation of α-Co(OH)2 during the HER and γ-NiOOH during the HzOR. Furthermore, the density function theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the decoration of Pd onto NiCo2O4 facilitates the optimization of both the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) and enhancement of hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. This work introduces a facile strategy for fabricating bifunctional electrocatalysts, potentially useful in energy-saving H2 production.

Substituted cyclic alcohol is one of the pharmaceutically essential scaffolds. Here, we report photoredox/cobalt-catalyzed reductive cyclization of alkynals using H2O for the catalyst turnover. This method was applied to aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes for five-, six-, and seven-membered (heterocyclic) ring formation with various substitutions on alkyne units. This H2O-added protocol was further developed into a one-pot transformation from acetals through in situ generated aldehydes, which shortened the synthetic path of the reaction.

Identifying functional enzymes for the catalysis of specific biochemical reactions is a major bottleneck in the de novo design of biosynthesis and biodegradation pathways. Conventional methods based on microbial screening and functional metagenomics require long verification periods and incur high experimental costs; recent data-driven methods apply only to a few common substrates. To enable rapid and high-throughput identification of enzymes for complex and less-studied substrates, we propose a robust enzyme’s substrate promiscuity prediction model based on positive unlabeled learning. Using this model, we identified 15 new degrading enzymes specific for the mycotoxins ochratoxin A and zearalenone, of which six could degrade >90% mycotoxin content within 3 h. We anticipate that this model will serve as a useful tool for identifying new functional enzymes and understanding the nature of biocatalysis, thereby advancing the fields of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and pollutant biodegradation.

The effective microbial conversion of syngas into medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) is limited by factors such as restricted gas–liquid mass transfer efficiency, the toxicity of CO to microorganisms, and energetic constraints. In a recent study by Liu et al. [ ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 5834−5845], a hybrid system was introduced, combining a heterogeneous catalyst and microbiome to enable efficient MCFAs production from CO under mild conditions. The authors extended the chemical synthesis of various compounds, including fuels, light olefins, and oxygenates, which traditionally occur in the gaseous phase at high temperatures and pressures, to this new hybrid system operating in the aqueous phase at 35 °C and with interfering biomass. They claimed that “in the hybrid system, inorganic carbon fixation into organic carbon (adsorbed pyruvic acid) was achieved by the heterogeneous Pt/Fe2O3 catalysts, and the adsorbed pyruvic acid was subsequently metabolized by the anaerobic microbiome.” Our perspective raises questions about the conversion of inorganic carbon (CO) into pyruvic acid by the heterogeneous Pt/Fe2O3 catalysts in this hybrid system (operating in the aqueous phase at 35 °C with interfering biomass). We find this claim lacks strong support from existing literature and the experimental evidence provided by the authors. Instead, considering that the biological system alone (without the presence of heterogeneous Pt/Fe2O3) produced MCFAs when supplied with inorganic carbon (CO) and acetate, we propose that the observed enhancement might be attributed to the stimulating effects of heterogeneous Pt/Fe2O3 serving as a biocarrier for the microbiome, rather than the direct chemical synthesis of pyruvic acid.

A series of modified carbon nitride with a controlled amount of carbon vacancies is prepared successfully by simple acid treatment, and the performances of the corresponding Pd/CN-X catalysts in phenol-selective hydrogenation are investigated. It is found that the Pd/CN-30 catalyst exhibits the highest activity, while Pd/CN-60 shows a very low activity. The characterization of powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra, temperature-programmed desorption of phenol and cyclohexanone, phenol adsorption experiments, and isotope experiment show that the high catalytic activities and selectivity of Pd/CN-30 are related to its relatively high Pd dispersity, high phenol adsorption capacity, and proper hydrophilicity. However, the much lower activity of Pd/CN-60 can be attributed to the existence of competitive adsorption of phenol and water molecules on the catalyst surface and its low hydrogen activation ability due to the support over modification that results in the much stronger hydrophilicity and the near atomic Pd dispersion. In addition, the stability of Pd/CN-X is positively correlated with the carbon vacancy contents due to the strong interaction between the Pd species and the support.

Biomass photorefining is a promising strategy to address the energy crisis and transition toward carbon carbon-neutral society. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of direct cellulose photorefining into arabinose by a rationally designed oxygen-doped polymeric carbon nitride, which generates favorable oxidative species (e.g., O2–, •OH) for selective oxidative reactions at neutral conditions. In addition, we also illustrate the mechanism of the photocatalytic cellulose to arabinose conversion by density functional theory calculations. The oxygen insertion derived from oxidative radicals at the C1 position of glucose within cellulose leads to oxidative cleavage of β-1,4 glycosidic linkages, resulting in the subsequent gluconic acid formation. The following decarboxylation process of gluconic acid via C1–C2 α-scissions, triggered by surface oxygen-doped active sites, generates arabinose and formic acid, respectively. This work not only offers a mechanistic understanding of cellulose photorefining to arabinose but also sets up an example for illuminating the path toward direct cellulose photorefining into value-added bioproducts under mild conditions.

Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycoestrogenic polyketide produced by Fusarium graminearum and other phytopathogenic members of the genus Fusarium. Contamination of cereals with ZEN is frequent, and hydrolytic detoxification with fungal lactonases has been explored. Here, we report the isolation of a bacterial strain, Rhodococcus erythropolis PFA D8–1, with ZEN hydrolyzing activity, cloning of the gene encoding α/β hydrolase ZenA encoded on the linear megaplasmid pSFRL1, and biochemical characterization of nine homologues. Furthermore, we report site-directed mutagenesis as well as structural analysis of the dimeric ZenARe of R. erythropolis and the more thermostable, tetrameric ZenAScfl of Streptomyces coelicoflavus with and without bound ligands. The X-ray crystal structures not only revealed canonical features of α/β hydrolases with a cap domain including a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad but also unusual features including an uncommon oxyanion hole motif and a peripheral, short antiparallel β-sheet involved in tetramer interactions. Presteady-state kinetic analyses for ZenARe and ZenAScfl identified balanced rate-limiting steps of the reaction cycle, which can change depending on temperature. Some new bacterial ZEN lactonases have lower KM and higher kcat than the known fungal ZEN lactonases and may lend themselves to enzyme technology development for the degradation of ZEN in feed or food.    

    

## Catalytic Enantioselective Construction of an α-Thio-Substituted α-Aminonitriles-Bearing Tetrasubstituted Carbon Center

Chiral unnatural amino acids (UAAs) are important structural units that are commonly found in a wide range of natural products and bioactive molecules. Chiral α-aminonitriles, which are one of the most important precursors for chiral α-amino acid synthesis, are widely accessible via the asymmetric Strecker reaction. However, the construction of α-heteroatom-substituted α-aminonitriles presents a challenge due to the lack of reactivity of electrophiles (ester, amide, thioamide, etc.) and their ability as leaving groups. Therefore, a practical and robust approach to their enantioselective synthesis is highly desirable. We herein describe an efficient method for the preparation of chiral α-heteroatom-substituted α-aminonitriles containing a tetrasubstituted stereogenic carbon center. This protocol displayed a broad substrate scope for both reactants in high yield and with high enantioselectivity. Several mechanistic studies revealed that the presence of nitrile is crucial for enhancing the reactivity and controlling the selectivity of the reaction. This work not only provides N,S- and N,Se-ketal motifs but also a powerful strategy for overcoming the limitation of synthesizable α-aminonitriles.

The chemical transformation of aromatic amino acids has emerged as an attractive alternative to nonselective lysine or cysteine labeling for the modification of biomolecules. However, this strategy has largely been limited by the scope of functional groups and the biocompatible reaction conditions available. Herein, we report the implementation of near-infrared-activatable photocatalysts, TTMAPP and n-Pr-DMQA+, capable of generating fluoroalkyl radicals for peptide functionalization and protein labeling within simple and complex biological systems. At the peptide level, a diverse set of iodoperfluoroalkyl reagents were used in the functionalization and stapling of tryptophan residues. Using this photoredox catalyzed perfluoroalkylation technology, we achieved biotinylation of intracellular proteins in live cells. Notably, given the inherent tissue penetrant nature of near-infrared light, we further demonstrated the utility of this technology to achieve photocatalytic protein fluoroalkylation in patient-derived normal and tumor tissue for downstream confocal imaging and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.

Interfacial water is an important participant in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR), directly affecting the kinetics of hydrogenation steps occurring in the CO2RR and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, its structural composition and dynamic evolution are difficult to investigate due to bulk water interference and the bias dependence. Herein, we adopt electrochemical in situ vibration spectroscopy combined with molecular dynamics simulations to probe the dynamic change of interfacial water structure on an electrified hydrophobic electrode surface and further explore the mechanism origin of suppressed HER activity and enhanced multicarbon products’ selectivity. We reveal that interfacial water near the hydrophobic electrode surface exhibits rigid intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction, and the degree of which increases with a bias potential. The strong intermolecular hydrogen bond makes it hard for water reorientation leading to a longer metal–H distance, which inhibits water dissociation and decreases *H coverage. Moderate *H coverage not only inhibits hydrogen evolution but also ensures hydrogenation of intermediates realizing promoted C–C dimerization. A faradaic efficiency of 75.2% for CO2 reduction to multicarbon products was ultimately achieved. Our results provide insights into understanding the role of interfacial water structure in controlling reaction selectivity in CO2RR.

Nanoporous structures facilitate the exposure of active sites and allow a high ratio of the space charge region to the bulk in water-splitting photoelectrodes. However, unfavorable surface defects may develop on nanoporous photoelectrodes, which deteriorate the band bending (built-in electric field) and trigger serious charge carrier recombination. To maximize the advantages of nanoporous structures in photoelectrodes, one common strategy is the introduction of ultrathin overlayers to passivate undesirable surface defects and traps, which usually require advanced deposition technologies such as atomic layer deposition. In this study, a process of drop-casting followed by O2 plasma treatment is employed to realize ultrathin and conformal TiOx overlayers on WO3 photoelectrodes. Notably, the ultrathin TiOx overlayer demonstrates dual effects of surface trap passivation and heterojunction formation on WO3 photoelectrodes, which result in suppressed surface charge recombination and enhanced band bending. The as-derived TiOx-modified WO3 photoanode shows an increase in water-splitting photocurrent (increased by 81% at 1.6 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode), along with a 160 mV cathodic shift in photocurrent onset potential. The proposed approach here provides valuable insights into the room-temperature fabrication of uniform and ultrathin overlayers for nanostructure modification.

Ruthenium (Ru) has been considered as a promising candidate for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, the hydrogen adsorption on Ru needs to be optimized to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Strain engineering is an effective method to regulate the hydrogen adsorption, while the systematic study of the strain effect over hydrogen adsorption of Ru remains a challenge. Herein, Ru-incorporated nickel–chromium-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets with different levels of compressive strain are constructed to tune the hydrogen adsorption. The strain-engineered Ru-NiCr LDH exhibits a low overpotential of 30 mV at 100 mA cm–2 and good stability over 10,000 potential cycles for HER. When the cathode catalysts are assembled in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE), the cell delivers high current densities of 640 and 1940 mA cm–2 at 1.8 V when fed with pure water and 1 M KOH solution, respectively. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of Ru-NiCr LDH is attributed to the weakened hydrogen adsorption caused by a downshift of the d-band center, which is induced by the strain effect. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of strain engineering in designing active catalysts for hydrogen production.

The crystal facet effect is a critical factor for catalytic reactions on metal oxides due to the different atomic arrangements and physicochemical properties of diverse facets. Based on a series of combined experimental and theoretical measurements, this work investigates facet-dependent oxygen mobility and reaction pathways for the oxidation dehydrogenation (ODH) of 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene on Bi2MoO6, which exposes the {001} and {010} facets (BMO-001 and BMO-010). The results show that the oxygen mobility of BMO-001 overwhelmingly outperforms that of BMO-010, reflecting the better capacities for selective abstraction of H from 1-butene, oxygen replenishment, and bulk lattice oxygen migration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the rate-determining step on the {001} facet is the abstraction of the first H in 1-butene and the abstraction of the second H on the {010} facet. The existence of the [Bi2O2]2+ layer provides a favorable channel with a low-energy barrier for bulk lattice oxygen migration toward the {001} facet. Besides, complex side reactions occur on the {010} facet, including the nonselective oxidation of 1-butene, aromatization of 1-butene, and the generation of CO and subsequent formates. The total oxidation and decomposition of byproducts result in extra CO2 formation pathways. Lattice and gaseous oxygen play different roles in the above reactions. The superior oxygen mobility contributes to the high 1,3-butadiene yield for BMO-001, while the extra CO2 formation pathways lead to an abnormally high CO2 yield for BMO-010. The generated aromatic coke and formates affect the catalytic stability of BMO-010. The facet-dependent oxygen mobility and reaction pathways result in a distinct catalytic performance for 1-butene ODH.

Carbon dioxide hydrogenation to value-added fuels and chemicals has been studied widely as a means to recycle the most-troublesome greenhouse gas. The reaction produces hundreds of different chemicals, and therefore, selectivity control toward specific desired products is of paramount importance. In this study, a hybrid catalyst system consisting of Na/ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) and a CHA-zeolite (SSZ-13 or SAPO-34) is developed to maximize C2–C4 light hydrocarbon production. Utilizing the compact 3.8 Å pore size of CHA-zeolites, the Na/ZnFe2O4 catalyst-produced long-chain hydrocarbons are efficiently shortened to C2–C4 hydrocarbons with over 55% selectivity in the hybrid systems. Notably, ZFO + SAPO-34 shows a preference for light olefins, while ZFO + SSZ-13 uniquely enhances selectivity for C3 products. The difference is attributed to the much stronger acid sites present in SSZ-13 than in SAPO-34, which promote hydrogenation of olefins and the ethylene-to-propane conversion reaction in particular. Further modification of SSZ-13 with steam treatment leads to the dealumination of its framework and an enhanced activity of the ethylene-to-propane reaction, yielding 32.8% of C3-selectivity. Accordingly, a hybrid catalytic system combining a CO2 Fischer–Tropsch catalyst with a CHA-zeolite is a promising route to produce light hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation more selectively than single catalysts. This work also demonstrates that acidity control could be a powerful tool to manipulate the reaction pathway that occurs on zeolite catalysts.

Oxidation of unactivated alkanes, which requires substantial energy for conversion to valuable organic chemicals, is a major challenge in both industry and academia. Herein, we describe how solvents affect and improve the catalytic oxidation ability of a mononuclear copper(II)–alkylperoxo complex, [CuII(iPr3-tren)(OOC(CH3)2Ph)]+ (1, iPr3-tren = tris[2-(isopropylamino)ethyl]amine), toward hydrocarbon substrates. 1 was prepared by adding cumene hydroperoxide and triethylamine to the solution of [Cu(iPr3-tren)(CH3CN)]2+, which was characterized using various physicochemical methods. Product analyses, along with theoretical calculations, indicate that homolytic O–O bond cleavage occurs during the thermal decomposition of 1 at 60 °C in various solvents such as CH3CN, CH3COCH3, C6H5CF3, and C6H6. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported variations in the catalytic activity of 1 depending on solvents. In CH3CN and CH3COCH3, 1 activates weak C–H bonds (bond dissociation energy (BDE) ≤ ∼81.6 kcal mol–1), while 1 in C6H5CF3 and C6H6 can oxidize slightly stronger C–H bonds with a BDE of up to 84.5 kcal mol–1. In supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), 1 can oxidize alkanes with strong C–H bonds, such as cyclohexane (99.5 kcal mol–1). The enhanced C–H bond oxidation of 1 in C6H5CF3, C6H6, and SC-CO2 was generally attributed to two different factors: (a) the nonpolarity of the solvent and (b) the absence of C(sp3)–H bonds in the solvent. Interestingly, in CH2Cl2, a nonpolar solvent with C(sp3)–H bonds, 1 exhibited similar reactivity to that in C6H5CF3, indicating that nonpolar solvents enhance the catalytic ability of copper(II)–cumylperoxo complex to abstract hydrogen atoms from substrates, regardless of the presence of C(sp3)–H bonds in solvent molecules. DFT calculations employing an implicit solvent model further supported the enhanced reactivity, without the need to account for the presence of a C(sp3)–H bond. The reactivity of the different possible reactive intermediates arising from the catalytic oxidation was also explored using DFT calculations. This study provides a perspective on how solvents can be utilized to modulate the catalytic effects on C–H bond activation.

Protein biomaterials would have the potential to address global challenges in health and environment. Numerous production methods of the biomaterials exist, with sortase-mediated ligation (SML) being one of the representative technique. SML facilitates the site-specific conjugation of two compounds: donor peptides or proteins with a cell wall sorting signal at their C-terminus and nucleophiles that have oligoglycine at their N-terminal. In our research, we reconstructed an ancestral sortase E, named AcSE5, through a combination of sequence data mining and ancestral sequence reconstruction. AcSE5, a Ca2+ independent sortase, recognizes donors with LAETG at their C-termini and can employ both peptides bearing GGG- or GAA-at N-terminus and straight-chained alkylamines as nucleophiles. The enzyme can achieve efficient peptide conjugation, exceeding 70% under optimal conditions. With AcSE5, we synthesized two protein conjugates: Venus-conjugated shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) and dual-conjugated VNAR via poly(ethylene) glycol diamine. Direct enzyme immobilization to amino-terminated polystyrene beads was also achieved using AcSE5. The resultant beads, when conjugated with hyper-thermostable ancestral l-amino acid oxidases (HTAncLAAO2), can be employed for deracemization of various racemic amino acids into d-form. For three of phenylalanine derivatives, preparative-scale (100 mg scale) deracemization can be achieved. This process provides high enantiopurity (>99% ee) and isolation yields (>64%) through chemoenzymatic reactions. The immobilized HTAncLAAO2 showed complete resistance to 10 repeated reactions for a total of 240 h. AcSE5 is an excellent enzyme for SML applications.

The adenosine 5′-monophosphate-mimicking nucleoside sulfamates are pharmaceutically important compounds that target aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and other adenylate-forming enzymes. Ascamycin (1) is a unique naturally occurring alanyl adenosine sulfamate isolated from Streptomyces sp. 80H647. In this study, we successfully enhanced the in vivo conversion of dealanylascamycin (2) to ascamycin by constitutively expressing an extra copy of bldA and adpA regulatory genes. More importantly, we performed gene expression analysis and protein structure–function prediction to identify alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS)-like enzymes: AcmF and AcmD. AcmF efficiently catalyzes the aminoacylation reaction during ascamycin biosynthesis, and this reaction is dependent on the Ala-tRNAAla supplied by AcmD. AcmF is a truncated AlaRS-like enzyme containing only the aminoacylation and tRNA recognition domains, whereas AcmD has an intact AlaRS-like architecture that efficiently supports AcmF activity by exhibiting resistance to the AcmF-produced ascamycin. In addition, we have produced the glycyl- and seryl-derivatives of ascamycin using the AcmD-AcmF enzyme pair. The mechanistic study identified Glu232 and several residues that play important roles in AcmF catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, AcmF is a representative class II aaRS-like enzyme catalyzing tRNA-dependent aminoacylation during natural product biosynthesis. These findings provide a potential chemoenzymatic approach for the synthesis of aminoacyl nucleoside sulfamates.

Electron delocalization is a versatile method to tune the electronic structure of materials for maximizing their maximizing performances. Herein, TPBD covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with controlled electron-delocalization characteristics (denoted as TPBD-R-COF, R = H, F, CN, and NO2) were synthesized by molecular engineering to systematically investigate the effect of electron delocalization on photocatalytic performance. We found that the photocatalytic performance can be enhanced by modulating local electron delocalization in COFs. The photocatalytic activity of TPBD-CN-COF is more than 12 times greater than that of TPBD-H-COF in oxidative coupling of amines to imines, where the yield of product was increased from 8 to 99%. The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that TPBD-CN-COF with the optimal electron-attracting group of −CN shows the highest charge separation efficiency and electron transport rate, while excessive electron delocalization is not better for such properties. Our findings provide a strategy to design and optimize the photocatalytic performance of COF-based catalysts.
