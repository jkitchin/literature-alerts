Incorporating metal oxides is a sensible strategy for enhancing the efficiency of precious metals. Upon the introduction of molybdenum oxide, diverse coordination structures were formed on the support surface depending on the concentration used. This modified surface architecture orchestrates consequential alterations in the electronic and geometric configurations of the active metal, concurrently influencing the catalytic performance. In this study, MoOx species were introduced into Pd in a controlled manner to substantially enhance the dehydrogenation activity of the N-heterocyclic liquid organic hydrogen carrier system. Pd−MoOx/Al2O3 catalyst─featuring an optimal 0.18 wt % Mo loading─demonstrated noteworthy improvement in activity, surpassing Pd/Al2O3 by factors of 1.57 and 1.24, accompanied by enhanced recyclability in two distinct LOHC systems. Integrated characterization and theoretical calculations elucidated the modification of the electronic properties of both Pd and Al2O3 upon MoOx introduction and the corresponding adsorption behavior of the reactants, highlighting the charge transfer phenomenon from Pd to MoOx.

The evolution of a promiscuous enzyme for its various activities often results in catalytically specialized variants. This is an important natural mechanism to ensure the proper functioning of natural metabolic networks. It also acts as both a curse and blessing for enzyme engineers, where enzymes that have undergone directed evolution may exhibit exquisite selectivity at the expense of a diminished overall catalytic repertoire. We previously performed two independent directed evolution campaigns on a promiscuous designer enzyme that leverages the unique properties of a noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) para-aminophenylalanine (pAF) as catalytic residue, resulting in two evolved variants which are both catalytically specialized. Here, we combine mutagenesis, crystallography, and computation to reveal the molecular basis of the specialization phenomenon. In one evolved variant, an unexpected change in quaternary structure biases substrate dynamics to promote enantioselective catalysis, while the other demonstrates synergistic cooperation between natural side chains and the pAF residue to form semisynthetic catalytic machinery.

Transition metal-catalyzed reductive coupling chemistry has been recognized as a powerful tool for the synthesis of diverse organic molecules. However, despite enormous progress in this field, there is no precedent for the tandem reductive coupling of widely accessible nitriles with electrophiles that contain σ- and π-type (σ/π-type) electrophilic functional groups simultaneously. Herein, we have established a unique cobalt catalysis system, enabling the chemoselective reductive coupling/tandem cyclization reaction of aryl halides (Br, Cl, I) bearing carbonyl moiety with a variety of aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl nitriles via the carbocobaltation of nitriles that is unknown yet. The protocol allows for the modular synthesis of structurally diverse isoquinolines with wide substrate scope (>60 examples), good functionalities tolerance, and good chemoselectivity.
