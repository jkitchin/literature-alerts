Highly enantioselective [1,3] sigmatropic rearrangement represents a grand challenge in asymmetric organocatalysis. Herein, we disclose a chiral phosphoramide (R)-NPA-Cy mediated [1,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 2-alkoxy indoles to access a diverse array of highly enantio-enriched oxindoles. The catalyst displayed good to high chiral control (89–99% ee) while maintaining a high efficiency (up to 99% yield). More than 60 examples were demonstrated. Mechanistic and computational studies revealed that the C–O bond cleavage of indole ether substrates can generate contact ion pairs stabilized by (R)-NPA-Cy via noncovalent interactions. Different catalyst–substrate noncovalent interactions were observed in the competing transition states leading to enantiomeric oxindoles, serving as the major factor determining enantioselectivity. In addition, this reaction was applied to the total syntheses of both enantiomers of (−)- and (+)-fusaspoid A in only five steps and reassigned their rotation values, correcting the original misassignments.

Suppressing the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the critical prerequisite for efficient nucleophile oxidation in electrochemical biomass upgrading coupled with hydrogen production. Herein, Cu91Ni9 aerogels with atomically dispersed Ni are designed as effective nucleophile electrooxidation catalysts with significantly suppressed water activation performance, exhibiting a remarkable 99.3% Faradaic efficiency in the conversion of methanol to formic acid. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu support promotes the formation of Ni–O–Cu active pockets, where Ni3+ behaves as the main adsorbed sites and electrophilic lattice oxygen in Ni–O–Cu serves as a hydrogen acceptor, thus accelerating the electrochemical catalyst dehydrogenation reaction and the spontaneous nucleophilic dehydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, Cu integration exhibits weaker OER competition by inactivating the deprotonation capacity of OH* to O*, promoting the Faradaic efficiency of formic acid. This work paves the way for the development of advanced catalysts to achieve highly efficient biomass upgrading by modulating the OER activity.

A facile method for the preparation of precious metal-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) from lignin, dicyandiamide, and transition metal salts is presented. Magnesium acetate was employed as a precursor for a sacrificial template, enhancing the porous structure of the catalysts. Iron content in the catalyst materials was optimized and a bimetallic catalyst containing Fe and Co was also prepared. The physicochemical analysis revealed uniform dispersion of various nitrogen moieties and transition metal centers on sheet-like carbon structures, along with some carbon-encapsulated metal-rich nanoparticles. Rotating disc electrode tests in an alkaline solution demonstrated the dependence of the ORR performance of the catalysts on their iron content and confirmed the high stability of both iron and bimetallic catalysts over 10,000 potential cycles. Anion-exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) studies revealed that the bimetallic catalyst outperforms the Fe-containing material, achieving a very promising peak power density of 675 mW cm–2 at 60 °C and 833 mW cm–2 at 80 °C.

The precise regulation of lattice oxygen is crucial for many redox reactions, but it still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile strategy to induce generation of bulk phase defects in hematite (α-Fe2O3) by ultrasonic treatment, thus achieving exclusive lattice oxygen activation without additional alternation of surface adsorbed oxygen species. This kind of unique lattice oxygen activation afforded negligible disturbance of NH3 adsorption but significant influence on NO2 generation via accelerated oxygen diffusion, resulting in enhanced activity contribution from the Fast-SCR reaction pathway. Particularly, the generation of bulk-phase defects was also found to be conducive to create thermally instable and chemically reactive surface nitrate species, which played a decisive role in activating NO reactant. Accordingly, a triple increment in the deNOx performance of the α-Fe2O3 catalyst for the reaction of selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 (NH3–SCR) was achieved.

The direct reductive functionalization of alkynes under mild conditions presents a promising yet challenging avenue for accessing value-added molecules. Alkyne radical anions represent a distinct class of reactive intermediates characterized by both a charge and an unpaired electron, thus holding great potential for facilitating diverse bond formations, particularly in alkyne reductive functionalization. However, the synthetic utility of alkyne radical anions is limited, primarily due to the difficulty in their generation and the formation of highly unstable vinyl radical intermediates. In this study, we accomplished the direct generation of alkyne radical anions from aryl alkyne feedstocks via single electron transfer (SET) reduction with photogenerated CO2 radical anion (CO2•–), enabling reductive hydroalkylation, arylalkenylation, and hydrocarboxylation of aryl alkynes. Our photocatalytic strategy features metal-free catalysis, mild reaction conditions, employment of a traceless reductant, good functional group compatibility, step- and atom-economy, and high regioselectivity. This study not only paves the way for leveraging the underexplored alkyne radical anions but also catalyzes the ongoing exploration of the bifunctional CO2•– species in synthetic chemistry.
