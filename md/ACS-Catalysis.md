Redox enzymes, mostly equipped with metal or organic cofactors, can vary their reactivity with oxygen by orders of magnitude. Understanding how oxygen reactivity is controlled by the protein milieu remains an open issue, with broad implications for mechanistic enzymology and enzyme design. Here, we address this problem by focusing on a widespread group of flavoenzymes that oxidize phenolic compounds derived from microbial lignin degradation, using either oxygen or cytochrome c as an electron acceptor. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis revealed conserved amino acid motifs in the flavin-binding site. Using a combination of kinetic, mutagenesis, structural, and computational methods, we examined the role of these residues. Our results demonstrate that subtle and localized changes in the flavin environment can drastically impact oxygen reactivity. These effects are afforded through the creation or blockade of pathways for oxygen diffusion. Substrate binding plays a crucial role by potentially obstructing oxygen access to the flavin, thus influencing the enzyme's reactivity. The switch between oxidase and dehydrogenase functionalities is thereby achieved through targeted, site-specific amino acid replacements that finely tune the microenvironment around the flavin. Our findings explain how very similar enzymes can exhibit distinct functional properties, operating as oxidases or dehydrogenases. They further provide valuable insights for the rational design and engineering of enzymes with tailored functions.

Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs), usually the melon phase, have been extensively applied as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction; however, their performance is still unsatisfactory. The condensed allotrope, namely, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) with extended conjugation and a crystallized structure, indeed holds more favorable compositional and structural advantages for photocatalytic CO2 reduction but remains to be fully exploited. Herein, hexagonal prism-shaped PTI crystals were synthesized and developed as a high-performance photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. With Co(bpy)32+ as a cocatalyst, the PTI crystals exhibit a CO evolution rate of 44 μmol h–1 (i.e., 1467 μmol g–1 h–1) with 93% selectivity, markedly superior to that of the melon counterpart. Moreover, PTI crystals manifest an apparent quantum efficiency of 12.9% at 365 nm, representing the state-of-the-art value by PCN photocatalysts for CO2-to-CO reduction without using noble metals. The surface pyridine N species of PTI are exposed as active sites to dominate CO2 activation and conversion, which, together with the high crystallinity to facilitate charge separation and transport, endows high CO2 reduction efficiency. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy determines the key intermediates during the CO2 reduction reaction and, consequently, constructs the possible reaction mechanism.

The hydrogenation of CO2 into high-value chemistry is seen as one of the viable strategies for solving the energy crisis of the future. Light olefins have attracted considerable attention as basic feedstocks in the industry. In this work, a series of Fe–Co bimetallic active site catalysts were constructed by a typical sol–gel strategy. The synergistic regulation layout of the Fe–Co bimetallic active site catalyst constructed highly active interfaces and exhibited high conversion (56.9%) of CO2, low CO selectivity (3.6%), high selectivity (40.5%) of light olefins, and remarkable light olefins yield (22.2%). The results of the associated characterization analysis indicate that the high activity interfaces formed by the synergistic regulation layout of the Fe–Co bimetallic active sites are the fundamental reason for the high yield of light olefins. The high activity interfaces formed by the introduction of cobalt drive the RWGS reaction forward (Le Chatelier's Principle), which further enhances the CO2 conversion. In addition, the dynamic evolution of the physical phase structure, elemental composition and valence, CO2 and H2 adsorption ability, and the formation process of light olefins during the reaction of Fe–Co bimetallic catalysts were analyzed by in situ DRIFT spectra and other characterizations, and a potential mechanism for the high selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins is further proposed. This work provides an effective and rational design strategy for the synergistic regulation layout of Fe–Co bimetals with highly active interfaces to promote efficient hydrogenation of CO2 for the oriented synthesis of light olefins.

Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), a predominant technology for large-scale industrial hydrogen production, faces limitations in commercialization owing to the inadequate catalytic activity and stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. This study introduces a NiFeAl self-supported electrode characterized by high activity and stability for the OER and outlines a rational design strategy for NiFe (oxy)hydroxide-based self-supported electrodes. The introduction of Al, a ternary dopant with relatively low electronegativity and a small ionic radius, into the NiFe electrode effectively controls the adsorption energy of O-intermediates and facilitates the deprotonation of adsorbed OH*, thereby accelerating the OER. Remarkably, the NiFeAl self-supported electrode demonstrates approximately 50% enhanced operational activity (0.71 A cm–2 at 1.8 V) compared to NiFe alongside exceptional stability (>72 h at 0.6 A cm–2) in OER within an AWE single cell. These findings highlight the significant potential of the NiFeAl electrode for application in AWE for efficient, large-scale hydrogen production.

High deuteration yields are difficult to attain with conventional chemical synthesis methods. In this work, we demonstrate that deuterated chemicals can be produced using electrochemical CO2 reduction in the presence of D2O. The absence of H2O enables deuteration yields over 99% for products such as ethanol-d6 and formate-d. With a D2O solvent, the competing D2 evolution reaction is completely suppressed at low current densities while being kept <10% at a higher 300 mA/cm2.

TiO2-supported Au nanocatalysts are highly attractive for the water gas shift (WGS) reaction due to their high catalytic activity at low temperatures. Herein, the (Au/TiO2–x)OP catalyst synthesized by the combination of warm and cold plasmas exhibits a high WGS reaction rate of 1.63 mol·gAu–1·h–1 at 120 °C, being one of the highest WGS rates among Au/TiO2 catalysts. The warm plasma generates a large amount of oxygen vacancies, while the cold plasma treatment generates small Au nanoparticles and interfacial sites. The (Au/TiO2–x)OP catalyst features two kinds of abundant active sites including Auδ+-Oδ−-Ti4+ and Au0-Ov-Ti3+, which accelerate the WGS reaction simultaneously along the intermediate and redox reaction pathways, respectively.

This study describes a photoredox/cobalt dual-catalyzed asymmetric Grignard-type addition reaction, enabling the synthesis of axially chiral hexatomic (six–six) N-heterobiaryls bearing the extra chiral secondary alcohol unit via an efficient dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of racemic N-heterobiaryl triflate substrates. The conversion facilitated via both photoredox and classical reductive reaction conditions exhibits good functional group tolerance, a broad substrate scope, and satisfactory stereoselectivity. Furthermore, control experiments and density functional theory calculations provide preliminary mechanistic insights.

N-Heterocyclic primary amines are highly valuable and recurrent synthons in the pharmaceutical industry. Amine dehydrogenase (AmDH)-catalyzed direct asymmetric reductive amination of the readily available N-heterocyclic ketones represents a promising approach for synthesizing N-heterocyclic primary amines. However, the limited substrate acceptance of AmDHs restricts their application in reductive amination. In this endeavor, we unlocked the substrate acceptance of phenylalanine amine dehydrogenase from Bacillus badius (F-BbAmDH) to access a panel of N-Boc-substituted heterocyclic ketones with a broad range of structural features. Based on the combination of a reverse substrate design strategy and structural-guided steric hindrance mutagenesis, two active F-BbAmDH mutants with expanded N-heterocyclic ketone specificity toward N-Boc-3-piperidone were generated, and two rounds of additional iterative site mutagenesis further increased the catalytic activity by 143.4-fold. The optimal triple mutant M3-2 displayed a significantly extended scope of N-Boc-substituted heterocyclic ketones, and its practical asymmetric synthesis performance was confirmed in the gram-scale synthesis of the key intermediate of alogliptin, (R)-1-Boc-3-piperidinamine, achieving >99% ee, 86% conversion, and 80% (4.0 g) isolated yield. This work lays the foundation for the biocatalytic synthesis of structurally diverse N-heterocyclic primary amines and gives referable guidance for engineering oxidoreductases sharing an analogous pocket into versatile biocatalysts.

Thiolase is essential in the first step of synthesizing many value-added biochemicals. However, only a few feasible THLs have been reported, and a limited understanding of these enzymes has restricted their broader application in valuable production processes. In this study, biochemical and structural analysis identified the specific properties of THLs belonging to three groups for synthesizing medium- to long-chain fatty acids, polyketide, and dicarboxylic acid, represented by adipic acid. We further demonstrated that hydrolysis activity, considered a rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic process, can be alleviated through flux balance and site-directed mutagenesis. Notably, we discovered two THLs with strong biosynthetic abilities and low hydrolysis: PaTHL4, effective for medium- to long-chain fatty acids and polyketides, and PaTHL7, tailored for adipic acid production. This study provides valuable insights into tailored THLs for specific biochemical production.

Aspartate ammonia lyases catalyze the reversible amination of fumarate to l-aspartate. Recent studies demonstrate that the thermostable enzyme from Bacillus sp. YM55–1 (AspB) can be engineered for the enantioselective production of substituted β-amino acids. This reaction would be attractive for the conversion of acrylic acid to β-alanine, which is an important building block for the preparation of bioactive compounds. Here we describe a bioinformatics and computational approach aimed at introducing the β-alanine synthesis activity. Three strategies were used: First, we redesigned the α-carboxylate binding pocket of AspB to introduce activity with the acrylic acid. Next, different template enzymes were identified by genome mining, equipped with a redesigned α-carboxylate pocket, and investigated for β-alanine synthesis, which yielded variants with better activity. Third, interactions of the SS-loop that covers the active site and harbors a catalytic serine were computationally redesigned using energy calculations to stabilize reactive conformations and thereby further increase the desired β-alanine synthesis activity. Different improved enzymes were obtained and the best variants showed kcat values with acrylic acid of at least 0.6–1.5 s–1 with KM values in the high mM range. Since the β-alanine production of wild-type enzyme was below the detection limit, this suggests that the kcat/Km was improved by at least 1000-fold. Crystal structures of the 6-fold mutant of redesigned AspB and the similarly engineered aspartase from Caenibacillus caldisaponilyticus revealed that their ligand-free structures have the SS-loop in a closed (reactive) conformation, which for wild-type AspB is only observed in the substrate-bound enzyme. AlphaFold-generated models suggest that other aspartase variants redesigned for acrylic acid hydroamination also prefer a 3D structure with the loop in a closed conformation. The combination of binding pocket redesign, genome mining, and enhanced active-site loop closure thus created effective β-alanine synthesizing variants of aspartase.

Sulfoxides and sulfones are pivotal pharmacophores and versatile functional groups in drug design; however, they are rarely found in natural products. In this study, we developed a chemo-biosynthetic strategy for the site-specific introduction of sulfoxides and sulfones into polyketide frameworks. This method involves integrating hydrophobic sulfide-extender units into the polyketide structure, followed by sequential oxidation with hydrogen peroxide to convert the sulfides into polar sulfoxides and sulfones. This approach addresses the challenge that polar groups face in being recognized by the natural hydrophobic pockets of biosynthetic enzymes. The sulfide-extender units were synthesized using a permissive acyl-CoA synthetase (UkaQFAV) and an acyl-CoA carboxylase (Arm13-ACC), which is specific to medium- to long-chain acyl-CoA substrates. The crystal structure of Arm13 was resolved to 1.6 Å, enabling the development of the mutant Arm13V157I, which exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency for short-chain acyl-CoA substrates. By incorporating these units into a deacyl antimycin (DA)-producing strain and feeding it sulfur-containing substrates, followed by oxidation, we successfully generated nine representative sulfone and sulfoxide-DAs. This work not only paves the way for the development of sulfur-containing polyketides but also provides an effective strategy for introducing polar functionalities into polyketide frameworks.

Dynamic structural changes in the reactive environment often lead to catalyst deactivation in the thermal-catalysis field. Taking advantage of the dynamic changes in bulk phases, interfaces, and surface structures to design highly active catalysts is a unique but important strategy. Herein, we report a supersaturated ceria solid solution catalyst enabling a styrene yield of 91.8% over extended redox cycles at 430 °C in the redox oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene. In-situ characterizations reveal that the oxygen anions (O2–) and transition-metal cations (Fe and Mn) reversibly shuttle through a ceria solid solution (bulk ↔ surface) in a K–Ce0.47Fe0.2Mn0.33O2−δ catalyst during the redox ODH process. The ceria solid solution acts as a dynamic transition-metal cations/oxygen reservoir, creating atomic interfaces of K–Fe–O/K–Mn–O and an oxygen gateway for efficient ethylbenzene ODH. The findings concerning the formation of a supersaturated ceria solid solution and cations, lattice oxygen migration, and the coupling between oxygen donation and catalytic reactions offer new strategies for designing high-performance dynamic catalysts.

The CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is of great technical importance and enables the use (and thus removal from the atmosphere) of CO2, a greenhouse gas, in a value-adding process. Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts are a promising alternative to more active but toxic chromium oxide catalysts. Despite its common use, TiO2 has not been investigated as a support material for VOx in the CO2–ODH of propane. In this study, we elucidate the interaction between titania (P25) and vanadia in the reaction mechanism by analyzing the reaction network and investigating the catalyst using X-ray diffraction (XRD), multiwavelength Raman, UV–vis and diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. Besides direct and indirect ODH reaction pathways, propane dry reforming (PDR) is identified as a side reaction, which is more prominent on bare titania. The presence of VOx enhances the stability and the selectivity toward propylene by participating in the redox cycle, activating CO2 and leading to a higher rate of regeneration. Additionally, VOx catalyzes the conversion of anatase to rutile, which facilitates CO2 activation, thereby leading to an encapsulation of vanadium. At higher loadings, reducible VOx oligomers are present on the surface, facilitating some PDR, but less than on bare P25. As the main deactivation mechanisms of the catalyst system, we propose the reduction of the titania lattice and the consumption of vanadium, while carbon formation appears to be less relevant. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing the CO2–ODH reaction network and applying a multispectroscopic approach to obtain a detailed mechanistic understanding of CO2-assisted propane ODH over supported VOx catalysts.

The design and development of supporting ligands have significantly propelled the discovery of new catalytic reactions and the improvement of existing ones. Among these, axially chiral biphenols and 1,1′-binaphthalene-2,2′-diol (BINOL) are some of the most privileged ligands used in a wide array of enantioselective reactions. Despite the well-established benefits of structural modifications to biphenol and BINOL scaffolds, particularly at their 3,3′-positions─for enhancing reactivity and stereofidelity in catalytic asymmetric transformations─only a limited number of 3,3′-bis-functionalized biphenols and BINOLs are currently available. Here, we report a unified strategy to rapidly access a range of axially chiral 3-monosilyl and 3,3′ bis-silyl-substituted and biphenols and BINOLs as well as their corresponding 3-monosilyl and 3,3′ bis-silyl BINOL-based phosphoramidites. This approach involves traceless acetal-directed, catalytic two-fold C–H silylation of axially chiral biaryls, coupled with selective monoprotodesilylation, expanding the versatility of catalytic C–H functionalization in ligand design and development. Scope studies on the augmentation of the topological space of potentially stereoselectivity-amplifying 3,3′-bis-silyl substituents in axially chiral biphenols and BINOLs were achieved through C–H silylation of biphenols and BINOLs using various dihydrosilanes, as well as the derivatization of 3,3′-silanes, leading to functionalized silane-substituted biphenols and BINOLs. Lastly, the phosphoramidation of newly synthesized 3-monosilyl and 3,3′ bis-silyl BINOL and biphenols with dichlorophosphinamine provided a series of 3-monosilyl and 3,3′ bis-silyl BINOL-based phosphoramidites. The efficiency of this synthetic approach is underscored by its short synthetic steps, expedited reaction times, and minimal purification, making it versatile for the synthesis of a wide array of organosilicon-functionalized axially chiral biaryls and phosphoramidites.
