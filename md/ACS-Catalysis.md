The discovery of acid-stable and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in the quest for high-performance water-splitting technologies. Herein, a heterostructured RuO2–CeO2 electrocatalyst was constructed by using a lattice-matching strategy. The interfacial Ru–O–Ce bridge structure provided a channel for electron transfer between Ru and Ce, creating a lattice stress that distorts the local structure of RuO2. The resulting RuO2–CeO2 catalyst exhibited attractive stability with negligible decay after 1000 h of the OER in 0.5 M H2SO4, along with high activity with an overpotential of only 180 mV at 10 mA cm–2. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to reveal that the interface and noninterface RuO2 sites enabled an oxide path mechanism (OPM) and the enhanced adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM-plus), respectively, during the OER. The simultaneous and independent OER pathways accessible by lattice matching guides improved electrocatalyst design for the OER in acidic media.

Cyclohexanone oxime is an important precursor for Nylon-6 and is typically synthesized via the nucleophilic addition–elimination of hydroxylamine with cyclohexanone. Current technologies for hydroxylamine production are, however, not environment-friendly due to the requirement of harsh reaction conditions. Here, we report an electrochemical method for the one-pot synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime under ambient conditions with aqueous nitrate as the nitrogen source. A series of Zn–Cu alloy catalysts are developed to drive the electrochemical reduction of nitrate, where the hydroxylamine intermediate formed in the electroreduction process can undergo a chemical reaction with the cyclohexanone present in the electrolyte to produce the corresponding oxime. The best performance is achieved on a Zn93Cu7 electrocatalyst with a 97% yield and a 27% Faradaic efficiency for cyclohexanone oxime at 100 mA/cm2. By analyzing the catalytic activities/selectivities of the different Zn–Cu alloys and conducting in-depth mechanistic studies via in situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the adsorption of nitrogen species plays a central role in catalytic performance. Overall, this work provides an attractive strategy to build the C–N bond in oxime and drive organic synthesis through electrochemical nitrate reduction, while highlighting the importance of controlling surface adsorption for product selectivity in electrosynthesis.

Herein, we reported the enantioconvergent Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling reaction with 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) derivatives via photoredox/nickel dual catalysis to access chiral products with good yield and enantioselectivity. The operationally simple reaction was carried out under mild conditions with good functional group tolerance. Due to the use of a stoichiometric equivalent of aryl/alkenyl halides as coupling partners, the sequential and iterative synthesis could be achieved smoothly in one pot for the synthesis of position isomers and stereoisomers. In the proposed mechanism, kinetic experiments and mechanistic studies indicated that the radical generation, depended on the excited photocatalyst and DHP, was the rate-determining step.

The design and construction of highly efficient catalytic active sites for promoting hydrogen spillover are of great significance for improving hydrocracking (HCK) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) performance in slurry-phase hydrogenation of vacuum residue (VR) but are still challenging. Herein, we report a carbon-supported MoCo dual-atomic site catalyst (MoCo DAC/C) and propose an oxygen-vacancy-induced built-in electric field (BIEF) regulation mechanism for promoting hydrogen spillover in HCK and HDS. It was found that the coordination structure of the MoCo dual-atomic was reconstructed and formed O vacancies in situ during hydrogenation process. The formation of O vacancies not only provided macromolecular adsorption sites but also broke the electronic balance and formed a weak BIEF between the Mo and Co atoms. Meanwhile, H2 was activated at the Mo sites to form active hydrogen species. The formation of BIEF promoted the active hydrogen spillover from Mo to Co sites by a Mo–C–Co bridging bond, thus improving the hydrogenation performance greatly. In HCK of VR, the MoCo DAC/C demonstrates remarkable catalytic hydrogenation activity with TOFT calculated for total metals up to 0.77 s–1 (two times enhancement than that of Mo single atoms (SAs)/C), the per pass conversion of VR of 76 wt %, liquid product yield of 92 wt %, and coke content of only 0.55 wt %. It also shows robust HDS performance with dibenzothiophene (DBT) conversion of 70 wt %. Density functional theory reveals that the formation of the O vacancies leads to the discrepancy of Bader charge between Mo and Co atoms, and the resulting local electric field can favor the diffusion of the positively charged (+0.10 e−) H atom. This work proposes an oxygen-vacancy-induced BIEF regulation mechanism from an atomic scale for enhancing the catalytic reaction process by promoting hydrogen spillover, which provided novel insights for the design and development of high-performance hydrogenation catalysts.

The unique low level of the ionization potential of indium(0) to indium(I) makes it an appealing metal for organic synthesis. Here, we present an indium-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling between chlorophosphines (R2PCl) or dichlorophosphines (RPCl2) with acyl chlorides (RCOCl). This one-pot approach, using indium-catalysis followed by oxidation, generates a variety of mono- or bis-acylphosphine oxides in good yields. Additionally, this protocol offers a convenient pathway to obtain the photoinitiators, Luricin TPO and IRGACURE 819, that are widely used in the industry. Experimental and computational studies indicate the intermediacy of phosphorus-based radical species that dimerize to diphosphines, which then couple with acyl chlorides through a four-membered transition state. Furthermore, we also explore indium-catalyzed reductive homocoupling of R2PCl or RPCl2, which provides facile access to various P–P bond formations.

Au nanoparticles catalyze the activation and conversion of small molecules with rates and kinetic barriers that depend on the dimensions of the nanoparticle, composition of the support, and presence of catalytically culpable water molecules that solvate these interfaces. Here, molecular interpretations of steady-state rate measurements, kinetic isotope effects, and structural characterizations reveal how the interface of Au nanoparticles, liquid water, and metal oxide supports mediate the kinetically relevant activation of H2 and sequential reduction of O2-derived intermediates during the formation of H2O2 and H2O. Rates of H2 consumption are 10–100 fold greater on Au nanoparticles supported on metal oxides (e.g., titania) compared to more inert and hydrophobic materials (carbon, boron nitride). Similarly, Au nanoparticles on reducible and Lewis acidic supports (e.g., lanthana) bind dioxygen intermediates more strongly and present lower barriers (<22 kJ mol–1) for O–O bond dissociation than inert interfaces formed with silica (>70 kJ mol–1). Selectivities for H2O2 formation increase significantly as the diameters of the Au nanoparticles increase because differences in nanoparticle size change the relative fractions of exposed sites that exist at Au–support interfaces. In contrast, site-normalized rates and barriers for H2 activation depend weakly on the size of Au nanoparticles and the associated differences in active site motifs. These findings suggest that H2O aids the activation of H2 at sites present across all surface Au atoms when nanoparticles are solvated by water. However, molecular O2 preferentially binds and dissociates at Au–support interfaces, leading to greater structure sensitivity for barriers of O–O dissociation across different support identities and sizes of Au nanoparticles. These insights differ from prior knowledge from studies of gas-phase reactions of H2 and O2 upon Au nanoparticle catalysts within dilute vapor pressures of water (10–4 to 0.1 kPa H2O), in which catalysis occurs at the perimeter of the Au–support interface. In contrast, contacting Au catalysts with liquid water (55.5 M H2O) expands catalysis to all surface Au atoms and enables appreciable H2O2 formation.

Technologies to improve the applicability of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are gaining considerable interest; one such approach is the immobilization of these biohybrid catalysts on support materials to enhance stability and enable their retention, recovery, and reuse. Here, we describe the immobilization of polyhistidine-tagged ArMs that allow the redox-controlled replacement of catalytic cofactors that have lost activity, e.g., due to poisoning or decomposition, on immobilized metal affinity chromatography resins. By using periplasmic siderophore-binding protein scaffolds that originate from thermophilic bacteria (GstCeuE and PthCeuE) in combination with a siderophore-linked imine reduction catalyst, reaction rates were achieved that are about 3.5 times faster than those previously obtained with CjCeuE, the analogous protein of Campylobacter jejuni. Upon immobilization, the GstCeuE-derived ArM showed a decrease in turnover frequency in the reduction of dehydrosalsolidine by 3.4-fold, while retaining enantioselectivity (36%) and showing improved stability that allowed repeat recovery and recycling cycles. Catalytic activity was preserved over the initial four cycles. In subsequent cycles, a gradual reduction of activity was evident. Once the initial activity decreased to around 40% of the initial activity (23rd recycling cycle), the redox-triggered artificial cofactor release permitted the subsequent recharging of the immobilized protein scaffold with fresh, active cofactor, thereby restoring the initial catalytic activity of the immobilized ArM and allowing its reuse for several more cycles. Furthermore, the ArM could be assembled directly from protein present in crude cell extracts, avoiding time-consuming and costly protein purification steps. Overall, this study demonstrates that the immobilization of redox-reversible ArMs facilitates their “catch-and-release” assembly and disassembly and the recycling of their components, improving their potential commercial viability and environmental footprint.

Hydrogenolysis of plastic waste using Ru-based catalysts is promising for deconstructing polyolefins into lower molecular weight products. Yet, the effect of catalyst atomic structure and size on activity and product selectivity is poorly understood. Herein, we expose the effect of metal particle size and atomic structure on isotactic-polypropylene (i-PP) hydrogenolysis over Ru supported on carbon. Despite similar molecular weight distributions of solid and liquid products, their physical properties are distinct due to different chain regio-irregular CH3 sequences of steric pentads containing racemo configurations. We propose that i-PP hydrogenolysis entails an interplay of C–C bond scission and stereoisomerization. The active site’s local electronic environment and structure dictate the former, whereas polymer–catalyst surface interactions creating suitable polymer conformations control the latter. C–C scission and stereoisomerization are structure-sensitive. Small, disordered nanoclusters are effective in C–C bond scission, whereas larger metal nanoparticles promote stereoisomerization. We hypothesize that a heterogeneous distribution of metal active sites is essential for deconstruction and product (lubricant base oil) quality control.

Copper oxide (Cu2O) is considered a promising catalyst that can effectively reduce the overpotential of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 RR) and increase the selectivity for C2+ products. However, developing high-performance and stable of CO2-to-ethanol (C2H5OH) based-Cu2O electrocatalysts remains challenging. In this work, Cu2O@Cu2S twin heterojunction catalysts with multitwin boundaries are designed to afford C2H5OH productivity at low potential through the electrocatalytic CO2 RR, and the C2H5OH selectivity is highly dependent on the facet of Cu2O@Cu2S with nanocubes outperforming octahedra. Detailed electrochemical experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ infrared spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of Cu2S boosts the high coverage of *CO, which can easily spillover to the twin boundaries to generate C2H5OH through the *CHOH_*CO coupling reaction pathway. A C2H5OH production begins at an ultralow potential of −0.45 V vs RHE and reaches 34 and 43.9% Faradaic efficiencies (FE) at −0.65 V vs RHE in an H-cell and a flow cell, respectively. Meanwhile, this heterojunction constructed with an interface coherent structure and suitable band structure can facilitate electron transfer from Cu2O to Cu2S, leading to the stability of Cu+ valence states. This work provides an avenue to precisely design C2H5OH production catalysts by regulating the interface configuration.

SOZ2– (Z = 3–4)-functionalized metal vanadates vary with the type of metal cations (Mn+) for the Mn+-O2–-V5+ channels that fragment to impart Brönsted acidic bonds (BA–-H+; SOZ2–-H+) and labile/mobile oxygens (OL/OM) with distinct populations and affinities for NOX/O2/H2O/SO2. SOZ2–-modified Mn+-O2–-V5+ fragments bind with NH3 to activate Eley–Rideal (ER)-type selective catalytic NOX reduction (SCR), yet, hardly enable OL coordination with NOX and are often hydrophilic, thereby limiting the activities of SCR or ammonium (bi)sulfate (AS/ABS) fragmentation, as gauged by the NOX consumption (-rNOX) and AS/ABS degradation rates (-rAS/ABS), respectively. Here, we justified the use of nonreducible La3+-containing La3+-O2–-V5+ channels, whose merits in accelerating SCR and AS/ABS fragmentation were found to be more pronounced for SOZ2–-modified LaV3O9 (LaV3O9-S) than for conventional/polymorphic LaVO4 analogues (LaVO4-S). Besides activating the ER-type SCR, LaV3O9-S bound with NO and activated Langmuir–Hinshelwood-type SCR, as opposed to LaVO4-S. The pre-exponential factor (k′APP,0) and -rNOX were thus higher for LaV3O9-S than for LaVO4-S and were coupled with the greater amount of OM in the former, leading to superior SCR performance under wet gases. Moreover, compared to LaV3O9-S, its Sb2O5-promoted analogue (LaV3O9-Sb2O5-S) provided a larger number of NH3-accessible BA–-H+ bonds to achieve higher k′APP,0/-rNOX alongside higher OM mobility. Furthermore, the LaV3O9-S and Sb2O5-S of LaV3O9-Sb2O5-S elevated the hydrophobicity and number of ABS-accessible BA–-H+ bonds, respectively. LaV3O9-Sb2O5-S thus revealed a lower energy barrier and higher k′APP,0 in AS/ABS pyrolysis than a commercial control (V2O5-WO3-S), resulting in a higher -rAS/ABS for the former. Consequently, LaV3O9-Sb2O5-S displayed superior SCR performance and greater hydrothermal resistance under SO2-containing wet gases in comparison with V2O5-WO3-S.

Nowadays, the assembling of hybrid water electrolysis using a hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) instead of a slow anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been established as a favorable technology for efficient hydrogen (H2) production. Nevertheless, it is still critical to develop highly effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR. In this work, we propose a facile approach for the design and synthesis of single-Pd-nanoparticles-decorated bimetallic NiCo2O4 nanoplates as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and HzOR. Initially, the NiCo2O4 nanoplates are synthesized by a combination of hydrothermal reaction and high-temperature calcination. Subsequently, single-Pd nanoparticles with varying proportions are decorated on NiCo2O4 nanoplates via facile pulsed laser irradiation (PLI), leading to the formation of Pd/NiCo2O4 composites. The optimized Pd/NiCo2O4 composite shows a remarkable electrocatalytic ability with a low overpotential of 294 mV for the HER and an ultrasmall working potential of −6 mV (vs RHE) for the HzOR at 10 mA cm–2 in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Thus, an overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer with the Pd/NiCo2O4∥Pd/NiCo2O4 system presents the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm–2 at respective low cell voltages of 0.35 and 0.94 V. Notably, in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy confirms the surface formation of α-Co(OH)2 during the HER and γ-NiOOH during the HzOR. Furthermore, the density function theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the decoration of Pd onto NiCo2O4 facilitates the optimization of both the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) and enhancement of hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. This work introduces a facile strategy for fabricating bifunctional electrocatalysts, potentially useful in energy-saving H2 production.

Substituted cyclic alcohol is one of the pharmaceutically essential scaffolds. Here, we report photoredox/cobalt-catalyzed reductive cyclization of alkynals using H2O for the catalyst turnover. This method was applied to aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes for five-, six-, and seven-membered (heterocyclic) ring formation with various substitutions on alkyne units. This H2O-added protocol was further developed into a one-pot transformation from acetals through in situ generated aldehydes, which shortened the synthetic path of the reaction.

Identifying functional enzymes for the catalysis of specific biochemical reactions is a major bottleneck in the de novo design of biosynthesis and biodegradation pathways. Conventional methods based on microbial screening and functional metagenomics require long verification periods and incur high experimental costs; recent data-driven methods apply only to a few common substrates. To enable rapid and high-throughput identification of enzymes for complex and less-studied substrates, we propose a robust enzyme’s substrate promiscuity prediction model based on positive unlabeled learning. Using this model, we identified 15 new degrading enzymes specific for the mycotoxins ochratoxin A and zearalenone, of which six could degrade >90% mycotoxin content within 3 h. We anticipate that this model will serve as a useful tool for identifying new functional enzymes and understanding the nature of biocatalysis, thereby advancing the fields of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and pollutant biodegradation.

The effective microbial conversion of syngas into medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) is limited by factors such as restricted gas–liquid mass transfer efficiency, the toxicity of CO to microorganisms, and energetic constraints. In a recent study by Liu et al. [ ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 5834−5845], a hybrid system was introduced, combining a heterogeneous catalyst and microbiome to enable efficient MCFAs production from CO under mild conditions. The authors extended the chemical synthesis of various compounds, including fuels, light olefins, and oxygenates, which traditionally occur in the gaseous phase at high temperatures and pressures, to this new hybrid system operating in the aqueous phase at 35 °C and with interfering biomass. They claimed that “in the hybrid system, inorganic carbon fixation into organic carbon (adsorbed pyruvic acid) was achieved by the heterogeneous Pt/Fe2O3 catalysts, and the adsorbed pyruvic acid was subsequently metabolized by the anaerobic microbiome.” Our perspective raises questions about the conversion of inorganic carbon (CO) into pyruvic acid by the heterogeneous Pt/Fe2O3 catalysts in this hybrid system (operating in the aqueous phase at 35 °C with interfering biomass). We find this claim lacks strong support from existing literature and the experimental evidence provided by the authors. Instead, considering that the biological system alone (without the presence of heterogeneous Pt/Fe2O3) produced MCFAs when supplied with inorganic carbon (CO) and acetate, we propose that the observed enhancement might be attributed to the stimulating effects of heterogeneous Pt/Fe2O3 serving as a biocarrier for the microbiome, rather than the direct chemical synthesis of pyruvic acid.

A series of modified carbon nitride with a controlled amount of carbon vacancies is prepared successfully by simple acid treatment, and the performances of the corresponding Pd/CN-X catalysts in phenol-selective hydrogenation are investigated. It is found that the Pd/CN-30 catalyst exhibits the highest activity, while Pd/CN-60 shows a very low activity. The characterization of powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra, temperature-programmed desorption of phenol and cyclohexanone, phenol adsorption experiments, and isotope experiment show that the high catalytic activities and selectivity of Pd/CN-30 are related to its relatively high Pd dispersity, high phenol adsorption capacity, and proper hydrophilicity. However, the much lower activity of Pd/CN-60 can be attributed to the existence of competitive adsorption of phenol and water molecules on the catalyst surface and its low hydrogen activation ability due to the support over modification that results in the much stronger hydrophilicity and the near atomic Pd dispersion. In addition, the stability of Pd/CN-X is positively correlated with the carbon vacancy contents due to the strong interaction between the Pd species and the support.

Biomass photorefining is a promising strategy to address the energy crisis and transition toward carbon carbon-neutral society. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of direct cellulose photorefining into arabinose by a rationally designed oxygen-doped polymeric carbon nitride, which generates favorable oxidative species (e.g., O2–, •OH) for selective oxidative reactions at neutral conditions. In addition, we also illustrate the mechanism of the photocatalytic cellulose to arabinose conversion by density functional theory calculations. The oxygen insertion derived from oxidative radicals at the C1 position of glucose within cellulose leads to oxidative cleavage of β-1,4 glycosidic linkages, resulting in the subsequent gluconic acid formation. The following decarboxylation process of gluconic acid via C1–C2 α-scissions, triggered by surface oxygen-doped active sites, generates arabinose and formic acid, respectively. This work not only offers a mechanistic understanding of cellulose photorefining to arabinose but also sets up an example for illuminating the path toward direct cellulose photorefining into value-added bioproducts under mild conditions.

Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycoestrogenic polyketide produced by Fusarium graminearum and other phytopathogenic members of the genus Fusarium. Contamination of cereals with ZEN is frequent, and hydrolytic detoxification with fungal lactonases has been explored. Here, we report the isolation of a bacterial strain, Rhodococcus erythropolis PFA D8–1, with ZEN hydrolyzing activity, cloning of the gene encoding α/β hydrolase ZenA encoded on the linear megaplasmid pSFRL1, and biochemical characterization of nine homologues. Furthermore, we report site-directed mutagenesis as well as structural analysis of the dimeric ZenARe of R. erythropolis and the more thermostable, tetrameric ZenAScfl of Streptomyces coelicoflavus with and without bound ligands. The X-ray crystal structures not only revealed canonical features of α/β hydrolases with a cap domain including a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad but also unusual features including an uncommon oxyanion hole motif and a peripheral, short antiparallel β-sheet involved in tetramer interactions. Presteady-state kinetic analyses for ZenARe and ZenAScfl identified balanced rate-limiting steps of the reaction cycle, which can change depending on temperature. Some new bacterial ZEN lactonases have lower KM and higher kcat than the known fungal ZEN lactonases and may lend themselves to enzyme technology development for the degradation of ZEN in feed or food.    

    

## Catalytic Enantioselective Construction of an α-Thio-Substituted α-Aminonitriles-Bearing Tetrasubstituted Carbon Center

Chiral unnatural amino acids (UAAs) are important structural units that are commonly found in a wide range of natural products and bioactive molecules. Chiral α-aminonitriles, which are one of the most important precursors for chiral α-amino acid synthesis, are widely accessible via the asymmetric Strecker reaction. However, the construction of α-heteroatom-substituted α-aminonitriles presents a challenge due to the lack of reactivity of electrophiles (ester, amide, thioamide, etc.) and their ability as leaving groups. Therefore, a practical and robust approach to their enantioselective synthesis is highly desirable. We herein describe an efficient method for the preparation of chiral α-heteroatom-substituted α-aminonitriles containing a tetrasubstituted stereogenic carbon center. This protocol displayed a broad substrate scope for both reactants in high yield and with high enantioselectivity. Several mechanistic studies revealed that the presence of nitrile is crucial for enhancing the reactivity and controlling the selectivity of the reaction. This work not only provides N,S- and N,Se-ketal motifs but also a powerful strategy for overcoming the limitation of synthesizable α-aminonitriles.

The chemical transformation of aromatic amino acids has emerged as an attractive alternative to nonselective lysine or cysteine labeling for the modification of biomolecules. However, this strategy has largely been limited by the scope of functional groups and the biocompatible reaction conditions available. Herein, we report the implementation of near-infrared-activatable photocatalysts, TTMAPP and n-Pr-DMQA+, capable of generating fluoroalkyl radicals for peptide functionalization and protein labeling within simple and complex biological systems. At the peptide level, a diverse set of iodoperfluoroalkyl reagents were used in the functionalization and stapling of tryptophan residues. Using this photoredox catalyzed perfluoroalkylation technology, we achieved biotinylation of intracellular proteins in live cells. Notably, given the inherent tissue penetrant nature of near-infrared light, we further demonstrated the utility of this technology to achieve photocatalytic protein fluoroalkylation in patient-derived normal and tumor tissue for downstream confocal imaging and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.

Interfacial water is an important participant in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR), directly affecting the kinetics of hydrogenation steps occurring in the CO2RR and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, its structural composition and dynamic evolution are difficult to investigate due to bulk water interference and the bias dependence. Herein, we adopt electrochemical in situ vibration spectroscopy combined with molecular dynamics simulations to probe the dynamic change of interfacial water structure on an electrified hydrophobic electrode surface and further explore the mechanism origin of suppressed HER activity and enhanced multicarbon products’ selectivity. We reveal that interfacial water near the hydrophobic electrode surface exhibits rigid intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction, and the degree of which increases with a bias potential. The strong intermolecular hydrogen bond makes it hard for water reorientation leading to a longer metal–H distance, which inhibits water dissociation and decreases *H coverage. Moderate *H coverage not only inhibits hydrogen evolution but also ensures hydrogenation of intermediates realizing promoted C–C dimerization. A faradaic efficiency of 75.2% for CO2 reduction to multicarbon products was ultimately achieved. Our results provide insights into understanding the role of interfacial water structure in controlling reaction selectivity in CO2RR.
