## Unraveling the Effect of Dopants in Zirconia-Based Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol   

OpenAlex: https://openalex.org/W4401631981

The doping of zirconia to enhance its activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has been studied intensively in experiments, but a thorough theoretical understanding of the factors that decide whether a dopant has a positive or negative influence on the reactivity is lacking. In this work, we conduct a mechanistic investigation using density functional theory and microkinetic modeling, considering the ZrO2(101) surface doped with 16 different metals. This analysis elucidates the following two criteria for enhanced reactivity. One, the ability of the surface to facilitate the dissociation of H2 and provide the H* species necessary for the catalytic reaction is deemed a necessary but not sufficient criterion. Two, dopants that are thermodynamically stable under reaction conditions in a 2+ or 3+ oxidation state are beneficial, since this entails the introduction of O vacancies, which stabilize O-containing reaction intermediates such as formate and lower key transition states. We construct linear scaling relations that can reliably predict transition state energies in terms of less computationally costly adsorption energies. It is revealed that dopants that are stable in the 4+ state (e.g., Ti), and thereby lack O vacancies, follow a different scaling relation with a higher intercept for formate formation, which can explain their reduced reactivity. Overall, our microkinetic models can successfully predict the trends for dopants that have been found active in experiments (Zn2+, Cd2+, Ga3+, In3+) and not. Together with the established reactivity criteria, this paves the way for computational screening of oxides for the important CO2-to-methanol process.

None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c03960.
    
A general method for the light-driven intermolecular anti-Markovnikov hydroamination of alkenes with primary sulfonamides, sulfamides, and sulfamates is presented. The reaction is mediated by a ternary catalyst system composed of an iridium(III) chromophore, a fluorinated alkoxide base, and a thiol H-atom donor. We hypothesize that the reactions proceed via a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism wherein implementation of the alkoxide base imparts additional thermochemical driving force for the homolytic activation of strong N–H bonds that were previously inaccessible using this methodology. This furnishes electrophilic N-centered radicals that subsequently interface with a wide range of unactivated alkenes for C–N bond formation. This protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope and great functional group tolerance, further highlighting the advantages of excited-state PCET as a platform for catalytic radical generation from common organic functional groups.

A comprehensive understanding of the intricate surface environments of practical nanocatalysts at the atomic level is essential for advancing our knowledge of catalytic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate PtCu octahedral nanoparticles with varying microstrains engineered by Cu dispersion. A detailed analysis of the atom configuration and corresponding microstrain is conducted. The intimate mixing of Cu and Pt results in increased randomness in atom displacement within the lattice and a more pronounced distribution of alternating microstrain on the surfaces. Specifically, we observe that the PtCu concave octahedral nanoparticles with alternating microstrain demonstrate a substantial oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of 3.95 mA cm–2 in area-specific activity. The significant impact of shear microstrain is further underscored, as evidenced by an 86.9% decrease in the ORR activity upon the removal of the alternating shear microstrain. This study sheds light on the effects of microstrain toward the ORR and provides valuable insights into designing advanced Pt-based electrocatalysts.

Dual-atom catalysts have garnered widespread attention for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet achieving an in-depth comprehension of the reaction mechanism and the structure–activity relationship remains challenging. Herein, carbon nanosheets with FeCo–N6 active sites (FeCo-NCNS) are prepared via a straightforward self-sacrificing template and cascade anchoring strategy. Delicate structural control enables hierarchical porosity, providing adequate active site density (2.5 × 1019 sites g–1) and fast mass transfer, as revealed by in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy. Moreover, the structural and chemical origin of the dual-atom site for enhanced ORR activity is uncovered. FeCo–N6 can be spontaneously transformed to an oxygen-bridging structure (FeCo–N6–O) in the KOH electrolyte, triggering improved charge polarization, downshifted d-band center, and optimized adsorption behavior for oxygen-intermediates, thereby reducing the free energy barrier. Therefore, the FeCo-NCNS exhibits enhanced ORR activity regarding the half-wave potential (0.90 V), mass specific kinetic current density (9.54 A g–1), turnover frequency (2.35 e– site–1 s–1), and improved stability. This work not only provides an effective methodology to construct efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversation but also highlights the dynamic structural evolution and charge polarization in improving the electrocatalytic activity of dual-atom sites.

Arylamines are common structural motifs in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and materials precursors. While olefin aminofunctionalization chemistry can provide entry to arylamines, classical polar reactions typically afford Markovnikov products. Nitrogen-centered radical intermediates provide the opportunity to access anti-Markovnikov selectivity; however, anti-Markovnikov arylamination is unknown in large part due to the lack of arylamine radical precursors. Here, we introduce bidirectional electron transfer processes to generate arylamine radical intermediates from N-pyridinium arylamines: Single-electron oxidation provides arylamine radicals that engage in anti-Markovnikov olefin aminopyridylation; single-electron reduction unveils arylamine radicals that engage in anti-Markovnikov olefin aminofunctionalization. The development of bidirectional redox processes complements classical design principles for radical precursors, which typically function via a single redox manifold. Demonstration of both oxidative and reductive mechanisms to generate arylamine radicals from a common N-aminopyridinium precursor provides complementary methods to rapidly construct and diversify arylamine scaffolds from readily available radical precursors.

The eukaryotic translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and its analogue actiphenol (APN) feature a glutarimide moiety and a six-membered carbocyclic ring system. The biosynthesis of CHX and APN is not yet fully understood, particularly with respect to the mechanism of formation of the fully reduced cyclohexanone ring in CHX and the aromatic phenol ring in APN. In this work, a combination of gene inactivation, chemical synthesis, and in vitro biochemical experiments highlighted an ensemble of three tailoring redox enzymes as being responsible for the biosynthesis of the six-membered carbocyclic ring systems. Specifically, two redox enzymes (ChxJ and ChxI) alone can generate an active intermediate that undergoes a cascade of non-enzymatic transformations to create APN, while a reductive enzyme (ChxG) acts as a gatekeeper, directing the same intermediate down a different pathway toward CHX. Finally, the full nature of each biosynthetic pathway was established in detail, including the formation mechanisms of six-membered carbocyclic rings.

Mass transport in conventional microporous zeolite catalysts can be enhanced by introducing secondary mesopores during hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). However, the impact of the macropore architecture with intrinsic mass transfer advantages over mesopores on HDO performance remains elusive. In this study, a macroporous zeolite monolith catalyst without a template and binder was synthesized using a crystal space-confined growth method. This catalyst exhibited a 1.3 times higher macropore volume (0.566 m3/g) than a conventional zeolite catalyst, while the microporous structure was similar. Moreover, the high degree macropore connectivity was directly visualized and quantified with an advanced nanocomputed tomography technique. The macroporous catalyst achieved a higher guaiacol conversion rate of 93% and better coke resistance (3.2 wt % coke) than the conventional zeolite catalyst, which showed a 90% guaiacol conversion rate and 5.6 wt % coke. This improvement was primarily due to faster diffusion rates and an increased number of acid sites in the macropores.

The Wacker reaction gives access to carbonyls from olefins and is traditionally relying on metals, mostly palladium. Here, unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are spotlighted as palladium-free biocatalysts for asymmetric anti-Markovnikov Wacker-type oxidation of styrenes, moving them beyond their traditional role in C–H oxidation and stereoselective epoxidation. Screening 53 wild-type UPOs for the oxidation of styrene and derivatives revealed examples of high reaction selectivity leading mostly to the epoxide with an epoxide selectivity of up to >99%. For selected UPOs and styrene derivatives, aldehyde formation was found with an aldehyde selectivity of up to 86%. Conversions of up to 89% were reached (preferring epoxidation). Stereocomplementary UPOs were identified for the epoxidation, giving access to the (R)- and (S)-epoxides with ee values of up to 94%. Also, for the anti-Markovnikov Wacker-type oxidation of α-methylstyrene, stereocomplementary enzymes were identified, leading to an excess of either the (R)- or (S)-enantiomer of 2-phenylpropanal. Most interestingly, it was found that the absolute configuration of the aldehyde formed does not necessarily correlate with the absolute configuration of the epoxide; thus, aldehyde and epoxide may have the same or the opposite absolute configurations.

Gallium nitride nanowires (GaN NWs) have shown great potential in applications to photocatalysis, including photocatalytic hydrogen evolution for solar energy storage. Previous studies have shown that GaN NWs can undergo self-improvement under light irradiation, which is attributed to surface oxidation, forming gallium oxynitride (GaON). However, the exact oxidation pathways and the effect of surface oxidation on catalytic performance remain to be understood at the molecular level. In this study, we combine computational modeling at the density functional theory (DFT) level with linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometric measurements to investigate the photoinduced surface oxidation of GaN NWs. We find that the oxidation of GaN to GaON is competitive with water oxidation. The oxidized surface shows almost no change in its water oxidation capabilities, although the potential required for hydrogen evolution is significantly reduced. Oxidation of the surface also leads to changes in the electronic structure, shifting the valence band edge states toward the surface adsorbed hydroxide, making hole localization there more likely. Calculations are consistent with the observation of shifts in the onset potential for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution toward more positive potentials over an extended 18 h period. The reported findings on the mechanism of photoinduced surface oxidation of GaN NWs and the effect of surface oxidation on hydrogen evolution provide valuable insights for the development of more efficient GaN NW-based photocatalytic surfaces for hydrogen evolution.

The orthorhombic Mo3VOx (MoVO) crystal catalyst has a crystal structure analogous to that of the industrial catalyst for propane ammoxidation. However, it has been observed that MoVO exhibits poor selectivity for the formation of acrylonitrile (AN). Here, we found that a higher AN yield was attainable over the MoVO heat-treated at higher temperatures (600 °C) in a pure nitrogen stream. Structural analyses revealed that high-temperature heat treatment caused local structural changes through the migration and the segregation of VO2+ without altering the basic crystal structure of MoVO. This resulted in the change in the chemical formula from Mo30.66V11.34O114 to Mo30.66V7.22O104. The kinetic analysis revealed that the local structure after the segregation of VO2+ exhibited improved catalytic activity for the ammoxidation of propylene as the primary product for this reaction, resulting in a high AN yield in the propane ammoxidation. The obtained results offer a new insight into the catalytically active structure of the Mo–V-based mixed metal oxide for the ammoxidation of propane.

The enantioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of alkynes and α-aliphatic nitrones has long been recognized as an important challenge, while considerable progress has been made for the alkenes and aromatic nitrones. We herein report an example of an earth-abundant iron-catalyzed enantioselective click-approach 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nonterminal alkynyl imides and α-aliphatic nitrones, and highly functionalized chiral 4-isoxazolines having a 3-alkyl-substituted stereogenic carbon center are modularly generated in up to >99% yield and 98% ee (54 examples). Although the steric bulk substituent on the nitrone plays a key role in achieving effective enantiocontrol, the challenge of steric bias differentiation between linear alkyl chain (Me, Et, etc.) and H of nitrones is also successfully overcome. The enantioface discrimination is presumably rooted in the well-defined octahedral mononuclear ferrous complex containing dual tridentate ligands (L*·Fe(OTf)2·L*, L* = (R,R)-DBFOX-Ph) and possible dual-mode σ,π-binding activation, which is evidenced by ESI-HRMS and single crystal X-ray analysis, as well as the L*/Fe ratio effect and DFT calculations. Arguably, the most interesting aspect is that the chiral iron complex can induce a superpositive nonlinear effect and the chiral bisoxazoline ligand with a low enantiopurity of 22% ee results in an 84% ee for the cycloadduct. Practicability and utility are demonstrated by the gram-scale synthesis and ready downstream functionalization based on the chiral 4-isoxazoline core and imide functional group.
