The C–C triple bond of phenylacetylene undergoes the anti-Markovnikov addition of the Rh–H bond of RhH{κ3-P,O,P-[xant(PiPr2)2]} (1; xant(PiPr2)2 = 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diisopropylphosphino)xanthene) to give Rh{(E)–CH═CHPh}{κ3-P,O,P-[xant(PiPr2)2]} (2), which reacts with a second alkyne molecule to produce Rh(C≡CPh){κ3-P,O,P-[xant(PiPr2)2]} (3) and styrene before the transformation from 1 to 2 is complete. The metal center of 3 undergoes the oxidative addition of the C(sp)–H bond of another alkyne molecule to produce RhH(C≡CPh)2{κ3-P,O,P-[xant(PiPr2)2]} (4), which also reacts with more phenylacetylene before completing the transformation from 3 to 4. The reaction leads to Rh{(E)–CH═CHPh}(C≡CPh)2{κ3-P,O,P-[xant(PiPr2)2]} (5), which reductively eliminates (E)-1,4-diphenyl-1-buten-3-yne to regenerate 3. Complexes 3, 4, and 5 constitute a cycle for head-to-head dimerization of phenylacetylene. Consequently, complex 1 promotes the catalytic homocoupling of terminal alkynes to (E)-enynes, including the dimerization of α-hydroxyacetylenes to (E)-enyne-diols. The rate-determining step of the couplings depends on the nature of the alkyne, being the insertion of the C–C triple bond into the Rh–H bond of a bis(acetylide)-rhodium(III)-hydride intermediate for phenylacetylenes and the reductive elimination of the product (E)-enyne-diol for α-hydroxyacetylenes. In support of the latter, complex Rh{(E)–CH═CHC(OH)Ph2}{C≡CC(OH)Ph2}2{κ3-P,O,P-[xant(PiPr2)2]} (6) has been isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Complex 1 also effectively promotes the formation of compounds of the type (E)-5-phenyl-2-penten-4-yn-1-ol, by cross-coupling between phenylacetylenes and α-hydroxyacetylenes. These reactions take place through two cycles similar to the cycle that produces the homocouplings, the rate-determining step being the reductive elimination of (E)-enyn-ol for both. The catalytic performance of 1 provides good efficiency in homocoupling and cross-coupling reactions involving progestin-type compounds such as ethisterone.

Copper-exchanged chabazite (Cu-CHA) zeolites are the preferred catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3. The low temperature (473 K) SCR mechanism proceeds through a redox cycle between mobile and ammonia-solvated Cu(I) and Cu(II) complexes, as demonstrated by multiple experimental and computational investigations. The oxidation step requires two Cu(I) to migrate into the same cha cage to activate O2 and form a binuclear Cu(II)-di-oxo complex. Prior steady state and transient kinetic experiments find that the apparent rate constants for oxidation (per Cu ion) are sensitive to catalyst composition and follow nonmean-field kinetics. We develop a nonmean-field kinetic model for NOx SCR that incorporates a composition-dependent Cu(I) volumetric footprint centered at anionic [AlO4]− tetrahedral sites on the CHA lattice. We use Bayesian optimization to parameterize a kinetic Monte Carlo model against available experimental composition-dependent SCR rates and in situ Cu(II) fractions. We find that both rates and Cu(II) fractions of a majority of catalyst compositions can be captured by single oxidation and reduction rate constants combined with a composition-dependent Cu(I) cation footprint, highlighting the contributions of both Cu and Al densities to steady-state SCR performance of Cu-CHA. The work illustrates a pathway for extracting robust molecular insights from the kinetics of a dynamic catalytic system.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to formate is an attractive carbon emissions mitigation strategy due to the existing market and attractive price for formic acid. Tin is an effective electrocatalyst for CO2R to formate, but the underlying reaction mechanism and whether the active phase of tin is metallic or oxidized during reduction is openly debated. In this report, we used grand-canonical density functional theory and attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to identify differences in the vibrational signatures of surface species during CO2R on fully metallic and oxidized tin surfaces. Our results show that CO2R is feasible on both metallic and oxidized tin. We propose that the key difference between each surface termination is that CO2R catalyzed by metallic tin surfaces is limited by the electrochemical activation of CO2, whereas CO2R catalyzed by oxidized tin surfaces is limited by the slow reductive desorption of formate. While the exact degree of oxidation of tin surfaces during CO2R is unlikely to be either fully metallic or fully oxidized, this study highlights the limiting behavior of these two surfaces and lays out the key features of each that our results predict will promote rapid CO2R catalysis. Additionally, we highlight the power of integrating high-fidelity quantum mechanical modeling and spectroscopic measurements to elucidate intricate electrocatalytic reaction pathways.

Coronavirus 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) are critical for viral replication and provide targets for antiviral drugs. Using the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model, we determined the crystal structure of an inactive PEDV 3CLpro variant (C144A) in complex with a peptide of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO227–233). Structural characterization showed that the conformational change to PEDV 3CLpro S1′ pocket conferred tolerance for nonconventional P1′-Val from a NEMO peptide substrate, indicating strong substrate accommodation. Using a combination of classical and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, we explored the free-energy landscapes associated with the acylation step of PEDV 3CLpro with regard to various substrates. The P1′ site plays a key role in the thermodynamics and kinetics of proteolysis, and the S1′ pocket might affect the free-energy cost of the acylation reaction. Our study provides structural insight into coronavirus 3CLpro-mediated cleavage and will inform the development of anti-coronavirus drugs.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide (COR) holds significant promise as an ecofriendly approach for producing valuable chemicals, such as acetate. However, the current unsatisfactory activity and selectivity of this process hinder its future implementation. In this study, we develop and study a catalyst composite comprising lanthanum fluoride (LaF3) crystal support and copper (Cu) as the active phase. Under typical COR conditions, the LaF3–Cu electrocatalyst demonstrates remarkable selectivity, exceeding 40% at −0.95 V vs. RHE, with a partial current density of over 280 mA cm–2 for acetate production. In contrast, the pristine Cu catalyst achieves only 56 mA cm–2 at −1.12 V vs. RHE with a low selectivity of <10%. Through detailed kinetic and computational studies, we attribute this remarkable enhancement in both selectivity and activity toward acetate formation to the stabilization of the ethenone intermediate at the LaF3/Cu interface during COR. Inspired by this finding, we extended this substrate effect to a bimetallic copper–silver catalyst, which led to a notable increase in acetate selectivity (>66%) under the same conditions. Overall, our findings introduce a universal strategy based on substrate effects for the development of selective and active COR catalysts.

Silver is one of the most studied electrode materials for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, a product with many industrial applications. There is a growing number of reports in which silver is implemented in gas diffusion electrodes as part of a large-scale device to develop commercially relevant technology. Electrochemical models are expected to guide the design and operation toward cost-efficient devices. Despite decades of investigations, there are still uncertainties in the way this reaction should be modeled due to the absence of scientific consensus regarding the reaction mechanism and the nature of the rate-determining step. We review previously reported studies to draw converging conclusions on the value of the Tafel slope and existing species at the electrode surface. We also list conflicting experimental observations and provide leads to tackling these remaining questions.

## Modulating Activity and Selectivity of CO2 Electroreductions at Au–Water Interfaces via Engineering Local Cation Condition

The mechanistic understanding of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under electrochemical conditions is crucial for optimizing the overall catalytic performance. While electrolyte ions have received considerable attention, it remains unclear how the condition of interfacial cations modulates the CO2RR and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we explore the CO2 activation and Volmer step representing the critical first electron transfer during the CO2RR and HER, respectively. This investigation involves manipulating the cation identity (K+, Li+, and H+) and concentration at Au–water interfaces, which is carried out via the slow-growth sampling approach integrated with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that the high local alkali metal cation (AM+) concentration facilitates the CO2RR following the order of 2K+ > 1K+ > 2Li+ > 1Li+ > 0AM+, and the highly promoted CO2 activation kinetics originate from the short-range coordination between alkali metal cations and reaction intermediates. However, the interfacial HER behaves very differently with the kinetic order of 1Li+ > 0AM+ > 1K+ > 2Li+ > 2K+, closely related to the interfacial water structures, which are affected by both cation identity and local concentrations. Overall, the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR at the Au–water interface can be enhanced by increasing the local cation concentration (K+ > Li+). These findings highlight the critical roles of alkali metal cations and reaction microenvironments in modulating interfacial reaction kinetics.    

    

## Controlling the Selectivity of Chlorine Evolution Reaction by IrTaOx/TiO2 Heterojunction Anodes: Mechanism and Real Wastewater Treatment

This study investigated the effects of varied loadings of TiO2 overlayers in heterojunction with conventional Ir0.7Ta0.3Ox (IrTaOx) anodes on chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) and real (waste)water treatment at circum-neutral pH. With an optimized design of IrTaOx/TiO2, elevated ClER selectivity was attained by more facile chemisorption of chloride ions to a thin TiO2 layer on IrTaOx. The current efficiency (CE) of ClER in galvanostatic electrolysis of 50 mM NaCl solutions (at 30 mA cm–2) was maximized to ∼80% by a heterojunction architecture with ∼605 μg cm–2 of IrTaOx and ∼265 μg cm–2 of TiO2 after specific rounds of drop casting. Further increases in loading resulted in escalated film-pore resistance or deterioration of ClER selectivity. The observed CE values were correlated with experimental descriptors, such as potential of zero charge and flat band potential, demonstrating that the weaker metal–oxygen bond strength on TiO2 could enhance the ClER selectivity compared to bare IrTaOx. We concluded that ClER primarily occurs on TiO2 near the junction owing to the nanoporous nature of the TiO2 layer, while IrTaOx serves as ohmic contact. The optimized IrTaOx/TiO2 anodes effectively improved the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate, but phosphate ions in livestock wastewater caused adverse effects due to complexation on TiO2. The heterojunction architecture effectively tunes the surface charge density for selective generation of oxidants, which can facilitate electrochemical water treatment with reduced use of the precious metals.

Identical location scanning electron microscopy (IL-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) are used to follow the degradation of the cathodic catalytic Pt/C electrode layer in a real proton-exchange membrane fuel cell under operation. During an accelerated stress test, mimicking start-up/shutdown conditions, the IL-SEM analysis reveals the formation and growth of cracks in the electrode layer, which expose the underlying membrane, leading to the creation of isolated islands of the electrode layer that tend to delaminate from the membrane. This is found to correlate with a 2- to 4-fold increase of the cell resistance. Nanoscale IL-TEM imaging shows that the diameter of the primary particles of the carbon support shrinks by on average 20%. Consequently, the Pt particles on the support agglomerate and grow by 63% contributing to an observed 65% loss in the electrochemically active surface area. The corrosion of the structural weak points of the carbon support leads to structural collapse. This collapse of the porous structure and weakening of connective points within the cathodic catalyst layers coincide with increased cell and mass transport resistance, resulting in large performance losses. While similar effects have been indicated before, the IL microscopy analysis provides a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the connection between morphological changes and fuel cell performance losses.

A ligand-controlled regioreversed 1,2-arylalkylation of alkenes via photoredox/nickel dual catalysis is reported. In contrast with previous reports on photoredox/nickel-catalyzed 1,2-alkylarylation reactions that initiate from the Giese addition of an alkyl radical to alkene, this three-component conjugate coupling process occurs through nickel-catalyzed aryl radical addition to alkene, thereby leading to a complementary regioselectivity to conventional 1,2-alkylarylation. An ortho-substituted bipyridyl ligand is the key to tune the regioselectivity, which was found to be dictated by the reactivity of alkene-coordinated LnNi(0) complexes that trigger the formation of aryl radicals via halogen-atom transfer (XAT). This regioreversed transformation allows a concise entry to structurally abundant β-amino acid derivatives, including ORL1-receptor antagonists.

Dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) represent a unique family of heme peroxidases that exhibit significant biotechnological promise. DyPs resemble classical peroxidases and operate through the peroxidative cycle, but they differ in structure and function and are ubiquitous in bacterial genomes, particularly in gut-associated species. Nonetheless, the metabolic capabilities and physiological roles of DyPs within the intestine remain unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a Lactobacillus fermentum-derived DyP (LfDyP) with the unexpected property of directly converting indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) into indole-3-aldehyde (IAld) and indole-3-carbinol (I3C). To elucidate the underlying mechanism, protein crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted. LfDyP was found to catalyze the one-electron oxidative decarboxylation of IAA to the skatole radical and its resonance via a long-range electron transfer (LRET) mechanism in the presence of O2. This catalysis initiates the IAA catabolic network, which is further formed through the formation of peroxyl radicals, dimerization, and tetraoxide decomposition. In summary, this study demonstrates the (bio)chemical basis for the catabolism of IAA by the intestinal microbiota into multiple indole-based signaling molecules.

Multicomponent reactions such as ammoxidation are highly desirable for chemical synthesis. The complicated reaction network and catalytic active sites involved, however, make it rather challenging for extensive structure–performance relationship investigations and subsequent rational design of an efficient catalyst. In this work, efficient VOx/TiO2 catalysts with concise components and exquisite structure design demonstrated 95% selectivity at 98% conversion under 2070 h–1 for 3-picoline ammoxidation. After clarifying that the oxidative dehydrogenation process is rate-limiting, we assumed that the abundance of reactive surface lattice oxygen at the interface of vanadium–titanium is the key to high productivity and suppression of oxidation side reactions since low reaction temperature is beneficial for enlarging the difference in rates of different energy barriers. In addition, rather than applying the traditional neutralization method with alkaline components, in situ formed V2O5 crystallite was subtly to cover the strong acid sites on VOx/TiO2 catalysts in that the strong adsorption of pyridine nitrogen in 3-cyanopyridine on strong acid sites can lead to severe hydrolysis side reactions.

Ga ions dispersed on alumina catalyze propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Their reactivity has been attributed to the presence of isolated Ga sites, while aggregation to GaOx oligomers and reduction to GaI are reported to be responsible for catalyst deactivation. In this study, we present the preparation and characterization of a highly active and stable single-site catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, consisting of fully dispersed GaIII ions on γ-alumina. The catalyst was synthesized using a surface organometallic chemistry route. Grafting [Ga(OtBu)3]2 onto Al2O3–500 results in the formation of monopodal [(AlsO)Ga(OtBu)2] (I). The controlled thermal treatment of (I) at 300 °C removes the alkoxide ligands and converts (I) into tetracoordinated [(AlsO)3Ga(AlsO-X), X = Als or H] (II). The structures of the intermediate species (I) and the active species (II) were confirmed through elemental analysis, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), solid-state NMR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Material (II) was tested in PDH at 540 °C and exhibited high activity and stability compared to its silica-supported counterpart [(≡SiO)3Ga], suggesting that the isolated nature and robust attachment of (II) onto γ-alumina limit its deactivation.

Atomically dispersed transition-metal catalysts have received increasing research interest in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the nature of the real active phase, specifically how the oxidation state of active species may affect the catalytic performance, remains elusive. In this work, ab initio molecular dynamics and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on neural network potentials have been employed to assess the structural stability of 52 single- and dual-atom catalysts with transition metals including Mn–Cu, Ru–Ag, and Os–Au embedded in the metal or oxygen vacancies on the defective TiO2 surface. On the thermodynamically stable surfaces, microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations indicates the metal atoms stabilized in the Ti vacancies with a positive oxidation state generally promote propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with the assistance of adjacent O sites, whereas those in the O vacancies exhibiting metallic properties act as a sole active site for C–H bond activation. The scaling relations established show that the adsorption energies of H and H&H can be used as two simple but effective PDH activity descriptors across both positively charged and metallic metal-doped surfaces. The calculated TOF under the realistic experimental conditions reaches a maximum at a slightly negative oxidation state, implying the Pt and Ir in the metallic state would dominate the kinetics of PDH. Moreover, a high selectivity toward propylene may be attained because the scaling relation between the activation energies for the C–H bond breaking in propane and propylene is broken in the absence of multiple metallic metal–metal sites on the atomically dispersed catalysts. An understanding of this structure–activity relationship is of vital importance for the rational design and optimization of heterogeneous catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation.

The controlled fabrication of metal nanocluster-based catalysts with high catalytic performance and stability is currently a research hotspot, while it is still a research challenge. Herein, nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (CS-N) with a regular and open structure were precisely designed and prepared. Pd nanoclusters with an average size of 1.44 nm were highly dispersed and stably confined in the radial mesoporous structure of CS-N, forming Pd/CS-N catalysts. The obtained Pd/CS-N catalysts showed high catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone and hydrogenation of benzoic acid to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (yield of almost 99%) under mild reaction conditions, outperforming most reported Pd nanoparticle-based catalysts. Theoretical calculation illustrates that the Pd nanocluster exists as an electron-deficient state on Pd/CS-N, thus can efficiently facilitate reactant preadsorption and activation, and also reduce the Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining step of the hydrogenation reactions. Moreover, the Pd/CS-N catalyst exhibited good reusability and stability. Thus, this work will promote the precise construction of stable metal nanocluster-based catalysts, enabling highly efficient catalytic hydrogenation reactions.

Catalytic dehydrogenative borylation of alkenes is arguably the most straightforward approach for synthesizing alkenyl boronates, as it eliminates the need for alkene or boranes prefunctionalizion. While transition-metal catalysis has conventionally been employed for this transformation, competitive side reactions including hydroborylation, overborylation, and regioisomer formation always exist. In this study, we present a radical approach for catalytic dehydrogenative borylation, which involves the synergistic merger of photoredox/HAT/cobalt catalysis, thereby circumventing the necessity for noble metals, sacrificial hydrogen acceptors, and high temperatures. This method employs stable and cost-effective amine borane reagents as feedstocks, resulting in the sole byproduct of H2. This dehydrogenative borylation methodology facilitates the conversion of a diverse array of functionalized alkenes into valuable organoboron reagents. Furthermore, the late-stage borylation of complex molecules demonstrates high levels of site selectivity.

Bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (BMOFs) have shown a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, attributed to the synergistic effects of dual metal sites. However, the significant role of these dual-metal synergies in the OER is not yet fully understood. In this study, we employed density functional theory to systematically investigate the OER performance of NiAl- and NiFe-based BMOFs by examining all possible spin states of each intermediate across diverse external potentials and pH environments. We found that the spin state featuring a shallow hole trap state and Ni ions with a higher oxidation state serve as strong oxidizing agents, promoting the OER. An external potential-induced spin crossover was observed in each intermediate, resulting in significant changes in the overall reaction and activation energies due to altered energy levels. Combining the constant potential method and the electrochemical nudged elastic band method, we mapped the minimum free energy barriers of the OER under varied external potential and pH by considering the spin crossover effect for both NiAl and NiFe BMOFs. The results showed that NiFe exhibits better OER thermodynamics and kinetics, which is in good agreement with experimentally measured OER polarization curves and Tafel plots. Moreover, we found that the improved OER kinetics of NiFe not only is attributed to lower barriers but also is a result of improved electrical conductivity arising from the synergistic effects of Ni–Fe dual-metal sites. Specifically, replacing the second metal Al with Fe leads to two significant outcomes: a reduction in both the band gap and the effective hole mass compared to NiAl, and the initiation of super- and double-exchange interactions within the Ni–F–Fe chain, thereby enhancing electron transfer and hopping and leading to the improved OER kinetics.
