Two-dimensional metal-containing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been employed as electrocatalysts. However, the metal sites were stacked within the layers with strong interactions, which hindered mass transport to them in the catalytic process. Herein, we constructed a pore-confined catalyst in a vinylene-linked COF for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via the Katritzky reaction. By anchoring the catalytic sites along the pore walls with covalent bonds, the catalytic units were well-exposed during the catalytic process and retained crystallinity and porosity, facilitating mass access to the metal sites. In addition, the electron/charge transported from the framework to the metal units modulated the electronic states, thus improving the catalytic activity. The catalytic COF exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.85 V and a mass activity of 109.7 A g–1, which are better than those of other reported COFs. Theoretical calculations revealed that the interaction between the framework and metal sites contributed to the easy formation of OOH* and OH*, resulting in high activity. This work provides insights into designing catalytic COFs based on C═C linkages.

The production of syngas from light hydrocarbons is a viable way of converting under-utilized hydrocarbon sources into valuable products until a full transition to renewable energy sources is achieved. However, current heterogeneous catalysts for syngas production suffer from deactivation, either by coking or oxidation. Here, we report on the behavior of model nickel catalysts within the context of ethylene partial oxidation and observe the catalyst-environment interaction as a function of reactant feed and temperature. Using a combination of operando microscopy and spectroscopy and focusing on a reaction regime characterized by synchronized self-sustained oscillatory dynamics, we are able to gain additional insights into the dynamic interplay between reactive species and active catalyst surfaces of varying reactivity. Real-time secondary electron imaging coupled with online mass spectrometry and thermal data shows that the oscillatory behavior is characterized by a highly active half-period during which the surface of the nickel catalyst is metallic and a less active half-period during which the surface is oxidized. Complementing the direct surface imaging, operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provides missing information about the alternating chemical state of the catalyst surface in the oscillating reaction regime. It reveals that changes in the gas phase composition (C2H4/O2 ratio) alter the population of reaction intermediates (e.g., carbides) on the nickel surface, which in turn drives the selectivity of the reaction toward different products. The observed chemical dynamics involve changes in gas-phase composition, rate-dependent heat of reaction, the chemical state of the catalyst, and the formation of reaction products, all of which are interconnected. Ultimately, the complex oscillations and catalytic behavior are attributed to a multistep mechanism that involves complete ethylene oxidation, dry and wet reforming of ethylene, and the reverse water gas shift reaction.

Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3–R) presents a promising pathway for carbon-neutral ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Enhancing NH3 selectivity through a tandem process can be achieved by combining Cu with a secondary metal, which allows for an adjustable binding energy between the bimetallic catalyst and key nitrogen intermediates. Herein, we developed a biphasic Ag–Cu heterostructure with a controllable elemental composition, which significantly improved NH3 production through tandem NO3–R. In-situ infrared spectroscopy and finite element simulations revealed that Ag serves as the active site for converting NO3– to NO2–, leading to a high localized concentration of NO2–, which is subsequently reduced to NH3 on adjacent Cu sites. Density functional theory calculations further confirmed the critical role of the Ag–Cu biphasic interface in promoting tandem NH3 production. This work offers valuable insights into the tandem NO3–R pathway in bimetallic heterostructures, providing a foundation for optimizing catalysts and advancing large-scale sustainable NH3 synthesis.

A series of shape-persistent bis-[C(sp3)-chelating] Ti2 (plus Zr2 and Hf2) complexes with a rigid linker component (xanthene or dibenzofuran) are presented. These structurally diverse assemblies display limited yet different conformational flexibility, and crucially, such geometric constraints confer access to a range of intermetallic separations and orientations to potentially enhance catalytic activity and cooperative effects. For ethylene polymerizations, the Ti2 catalysts (in conjunction with trityl borate) exhibit greater efficiencies and produced polymers with higher Mw than mononuclear controls, which is significant considering the more crowded environment for cofacial bimetallic sites. Proficient 1-hexene incorporations were observed for ethylene-(α-olefin) copolymerization reactions. The F-substituted m-aryl/dibenzofuran-linked catalyst (5), which is revealed by NMR analysis to be conformationally dissimilar to its F-absent congener, produced copolymers with higher Mw and elevated 1-hexene incorporation levels (up to 44%), when compared with its mono-Ti control (19%). These results suggest that catalyst frameworks with suitably adjustable conformations and Ti···Ti distances can facilitate bimetallic enchainment interactions with α-olefin substrates and their insertion.

As one of the cleanest fossil fuel resources, methane is also the second largest greenhouse gas after CO2 owing to its strong greenhouse effect. The direct emission of large quantities of trace and unburned methane causes a serious energy loss and greenhouse effect. Catalytic methane combustion is a promising strategy in eliminating methane slip to address the urgent environmental issue. However, the current methane abatement catalysts still face great challenges in thermal stability, water resistance, and sulfur tolerance. In this review, we focus on the popular noble metal-based catalysts, discuss the distinct reaction mechanisms including the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, Eley–Rideal model, Mars–van Krevelen model, and two-term mechanisms. The deactivation mechanisms induced by sintering, sulfur, and water on popular Pd-based catalysts are then analyzed. Then, we outline the promotion strategies from two aspects, i.e., construction of a core–shell structure and electronic engineering of the active phase to improve thermal stability and poisoning resistance. Finally, a summary and prospects with an emphasis on the newly developed oxide-metal interfaces and photothermal catalysis for highly efficient methane combustion are addressed.    

    

## Photoelectrochemical Synthesis of Benzo[b]phosphole Oxides via Sequential P–H/C–H Bond Functionalizations

Benzo[b]phosphole oxides are important P-heterocycles that find applications in optoelectronics due to their inherent photophysical properties. Traditional routes for the synthesis of such molecules from readily available precursors require stoichiometric amounts of transition metal salts, bases, oxidants, and additives, thereby lacking efficiency. Photochemical pathways still need a terminal oxidant to complement the photocatalytic cycle, whereas electricity may be a viable oxidant. Hence, photoelectrochemistry (PEC), combining photocatalysis and synthetic organic electrochemistry, was used to simplify the synthetic protocols. We use the potency of 4CzIPN for the consecutive P–H/C–H bond functionalizations for preparing benzo[b]phosphole oxides from secondary phosphine oxides and nonactivated internal alkynes with up to 93% yields and with good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations confirm an intermolecular electron transfer between 4CzIPN and aryl secondary phosphine oxides upon photoexcitation. The photocatalyst is regenerated by anodic oxidation.

The asymmetric addition of allylic boronates to electrophiles is a powerful method for preparing chiral molecules bearing synthetically valuable allylic moieties. While effective catalytic methods exist, they have so far been limited to the enantioselective allyl- and crotyl-boration of carbonyl compounds and imines, thereby forming C–C bonds. Here, we present a strategy that expands the scope of this catalytic asymmetric platform to include the stereoselective formation of C–N bonds. We have identified an inexpensive and readily available chiral diol that catalyzes the addition of allylic boronates to azodicarboxylates, affording chiral allylic hydrazides with high stereocontrol. This electrophilic amination chemistry shows a broad substrate scope and requires mild conditions, proceeding at ambient temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral diol catalyst facilitates the formation of a chiral allylic boronate through the reversible exchange of the boron's achiral alkoxy ligand. By coordination with the electrophilic azodicarboxylate, the substrates mutually activate each other, allowing for the stereoselective transfer of the allyl group.

A metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) structure is an attractive interfacial structure for efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting reactions. However, developing a cost-effective and highly active photoelectrode for the PEC water-splitting reaction is still a major challenge. In this study, we use an easy-to-operate and economical UV/ozone (UV/O3) oxidation process to prepare ultrathin SiOx oxide as an insulating layer, which is integrated with the bilayer non-precious-metal collector Al/Ni serving as the catalyst and the p-Si semiconductor to obtain a cost-effective and efficient MIS structure photocathode. The outcomes demonstrate that the ultrathin SiOx insulation layer significantly improves the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), through comparing the photovoltage and photocurrent density of the MIS system. The inner metal Al in the bilayer collector Al/Ni regulates the degree of band bending at the semiconductor–metal interface. Additionally, the presence of the ultrathin Al2O3 insulation layer effectively reduces Fermi-level pinning, which promotes the efficient transfer of photoelectrons to electrolytes. These were confirmed through photoelectric performance testing of the MIS system. The generation of a photocurrent of 15 mA cm–2 at a potential level of 0 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) has been obtained by optimizing the thickness of the SiOx and bilayer non-precious-metal collector. This study presents an economical and efficient strategy for enhancing PEC-HER performance in silicon-based photocathodes using an MIS structure.    

    

## {TiO2/TiO2(B)} Quantum Dot Hybrids: A Comprehensible Route toward High-Performance [>0.1 mol gr–1 h–1] Photocatalytic H2 Production from H2O

Industrial-scale photocatalytic H2 production from H2O is a forward-looking aim in research and technology. To this end, understanding the key properties of TiO2 as a reference H2 production photocatalyst paves the way. Herein, we explore the TiO2 nanosize limits, in conjunction with the TiO2(B) nanophase, as a strategy to enhance the photocatalytic H2 production at >150 mmol/g/h. We present a targeted engineering realm on the synthesis of quantum dots (QDs) of TiO2 consisting of an anatase core (3 nm) interfaced with a nanometric shell of the TiO2(B) phase, synthesized through a modified flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) process. The {TiO2-anatase/TiO2(B)} core–shell QDs, with high specific surface area SSA = 360 m2/gr, achieve a milestone H2 production yield of 156 mmol/g/h and solar-to-H2 efficiency nSTH = 24.2%. We demonstrate that diligent control of the TiO2-anatase/TiO2(B) heterojunction, in tandem with lattice microstrain, are key factors that contribute to the superior H2 production, i.e., not only the high SSA of the QDs. At these quantum-size limits, the formation of lattice dislocations and interstitial Ti centers enhances photon absorption at ∼2.3 eV (540 nm), resulting in the generation of midgap states around the Fermi energy. EPR spectroscopy provides direct evidence that the photoinduced holes are preferentially localized on the TiO2(B) shell, while the photoinduced electrons accumulate on the anatase nanophase. Combined electrochemical and photocatalytic analyses demonstrate that the presence of an optimal TiO2(B) phase is significant for the photoactivity of TiO2 in all QD materials. High SSA does contribute to enhanced photocatalytic H2 production; however, its role is not the key-determinant. TiO2 lattice-dislocations in QDs provide extra DOS that can additionally assist in the photon utilization efficiency. Overall, the present work reveals a general concept, that is, at the quantum-size scale, lattice microstrain engineering and interstitial-states' formation are spontaneously facilitated by nanolattice physics. Diligent optimization of these properties offers a pathway toward high-end photocatalytic efficacy.

Alcohol dehydrogenation catalysts in an aerobic atmosphere are often inspired by biological cofactors, which play a major role in controlling the redox chemistry. A large body of work mimicking quinone-containing cofactors established two major mechanistic routes, addition–elimination or transamination. Both of these pathways are completely regulated by two-electron processes, despite the possibility of the cofactor motif being reduced by one electron. In stark contrast to the established mechanisms, we demonstrate a one-electron pathway in quinone catalysis toward dehydrogenating alcohols. The described pyrene dione molecule is efficient in catalytic dehydrogenation of primary, secondary, and aliphatic alcohols. The process starts with the photoexcitation of the dione motif which becomes photoreduced by KOtBu to generate a persistent semiquinonate radical. The substrate alcohol interacts with the quinone backbone to forge a hydrogen-bonded intermediate, which leads to a crucial hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step, to accomplish the dehydrogenation reaction. A series of kinetic experiments including Bell–Evans–Polanyi correlation with the bond dissociation enthalpy firmly establish HAT to be rate-determining during dehydrogenation reactions. A kinetic isotope effect measured for the dehydrogenation process at 30 °C is 7.7 ± 0.9. Interception of a series of intermediates by a radical quencher in conjunction with a radical-probe substrate further affirms the radical-mediated, one-electron pathway to be operative that is in striking contrast to two-electron-driven quinone catalysis established so far.

NiMo-based alloys and NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) are the most promising nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) under alkaline conditions. However, the ready leaching of Mo and Fe during electrolysis may cause dynamic variation of the surface composition and structure of the catalysts. Here, we developed a NiMoFe heterostructure consisting of NiMoFe alloy and MoO42–-intercalated NiFe-LDH (NiMoFe HI), which enables self-optimization of HER and self-healing of OER through the dynamic exchange of MoO42– species. During the HER process, the leaching and readsorption of MoO42– optimizes the electronic structure of NiFe-LDH, facilitating H2O adsorption and dissociation. Simultaneously, the repulsion of OH– by accumulated MoO42– in the electric double layer can more rapidly drive the transfer kinetics of *OH + e ⇌ OH– to promote the desorption of *OH from the active sites, thus continuously enhancing the HER activity. During the OER process, the dynamic equilibrium of MoO42– facilitates the readsorption of active Fe(OH)x species on the NiFeOOH surface and reduces the energy barrier of the OER rate-determining step, achieving self-healing of the OER activity. Benefiting from the self-optimization and self-healing properties for HER and OER, NiMoFe LDH exhibits promising performance in alkaline water splitting, with a low cell voltage of 1.528 V at 10 mA·cm–2 and stable operation at a high current density of 100 mA·cm–2 for 150 h.

The site-selective functionalization of carbon(sp3)–hydrogen bonds in saturated amines remains a persistent challenge owing to their intrinsic electronic deficiency, particularly in activating the α and β positions simultaneously for annulation reactions. Herein, we report a copper(I)-catalyzed dehydrogenation and [2 + 3] cycloaddition of commercially available amines with diaziridinone, which facilitated the direct synthesis of highly valuable imidazolidone derivatives. Operationally simple methodology has a broad substrate scope and convenient scalability, providing an effective and complementary platform for the rapid incorporation of N-heterocycles into amine molecules. Furthermore, comprehensive mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicated the pathway of the radical-type hydrogen atom transfer and [2 + 3] cycloaddition, which were promoted by a four-membered copper(III) species.

Nitrate ion is a common pollutant in surface and groundwater. Hence, its catalytic conversion into ammonia at ambient conditions by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical pathways is an attractive alternative to current ammonia production from the energy-intensive and high-carbon-featuring Haber-Bosch process. As such, developing highly active and product-selective catalysts with good durability and cost-effectiveness is highly desired. In this work, exfoliated MoS2-x is reported as a highly active and selective electrocatalyst and a photoelectrocatalyst for nitrate reduction to ammonia. Exfoliation via the acid treatment of bulk MoS2 results in exfoliated MoS2-x, which is only a few layers thick and has a high degree of sulfur vacancies (ca. 12−13%). Electrochemical studies and electrolysis product analysis reveal promising nitrate reduction activity, which is found to be highly enhanced by the application of visible light illumination. The exfoliated MoS2-x achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 69% with an ammonia yield rate of 5.56 mmol gcat–1 h–1 in the absence of a light source, which is enhanced to 80% with an ammonia yield of 7.48 mmol gcat–1 h–1 upon visible light illumination. DFT calculations support the binding of nitrate and other NOx species to the sulfur vacancies, resulting in the formation of *N, which is then reduced to ammonia.

Uridine/guanosine diphosphate-mannose (UDP/GDP-Man) is the major mannosyl donor in producing mannose-containing oligo/polysaccharides. Its acquisition is greatly limited by its complex and costly synthetic process, which requires multiple substrates and enzymes. The natural UDP/GDP-glucose 2-epimerase functioning C2 epimerization between UDP/GDP-Glc and UDP/GDP-Man remains unreported which is the main hurdle to realize concise production of UDP/GDP-Man. Here, the UDP-glucose 2-epimerase (Glc2E), which behaves like a naturally evolved enzyme, is created and exhibits high-efficient catalysis in producing UDP-Man. Multidimensional engineering, including redesigning the nucleobase recognition region, displacement of the substrate tunnel entrance, and expansion of space for sugar ring rotation, is employed to develop Glc2E from CDP-tyvelose 2-epimerase. Glc2E converts 55.63% of UDP-Glc to UDP-Man, a trace value for the initial enzyme, stTyvE, and its aptitude for GDP-Glc epimerization evolves from unobserved activity to 23.94% conversion. Coupling sucrose synthase with Glc2E achieves the theoretical synthase–epimerase route for UDP/GDP-Man production from inexpensive sucrose. The space-time-yield of UDP-Man is maximized to 8.05 g/L/h within 2.5 h, with a final titer of 22.54 g/L, demonstrating competitive application potential. Moreover, the GDP-Man is synthesized successfully at a titer of 3.49 g/L. Our work inspires the enzyme engineering for epimerases and glycosyltransferases that catalyze nucleotide sugars. The application of Glc2E in the synthase–epimerase route unlocks a concise and feasible synthetic approach for producing cost-competitive mannosyl donors.

Supporting ligands limit the degree of electrophilic activation for any substrate because they also reduce the Lewis acidity of the transition metal ion. Here, we temporarily mask the Lewis acidity of dicationic Pd(II) by using "shapeshifting" bidentate pyrimidine/olefin ligands L1 and L2. These ligands delocalize/relocalize charge via reversible C–N bond formation. So, although ligated dicationic Pd compounds [1]2+ and [2]2+ appear charge separated (distributed across Pd and ligand), they react comparably to a solvated Pd(II) dication. Despite reacting like strong Lewis acids, the complexes are tolerant of polar functional groups (Lewis bases that often inhibit electrophilic catalysis). We propose that this property originates from the installation of a more nucleophilic (charge separated) state. This case study suggests that catalysts featuring reversible dynamics can be advantageous relative to their structurally static counterparts.

The effects of the electrical double layer (EDL), which pertain to the compositions and interactions among electrolyte species, significantly impact the catalytic process. There is a pressing need to investigate the role of electrolyte components and to deepen our understanding of EDL effects. In this study, we tune the water activity within a range of anionic surfactants featuring different functional groups to adjust H2 evolution activity and CO2 reduction selectivity. We demonstrate that these anionic surfactants are active in the local reaction environment under a cathodic potential. The enhanced selectivity of CO2 to CO can be attributed to the robust interfacial hydrogen-bonding network reformed by the anionic surfactants. This network diminishes the water dissociation activity and promotes the hydrogenation step in CO2 reduction. Notably, the electrolyte incorporating anionic surfactants improves the CO2 reduction performance, registering CO Faradaic efficiencies of 89.7% (RSO3–, SDS), 97.5% (RSO4–, SLS), 98.4% (RPO42–, SMP), and 98.9% (RCOO–, SL) at −1.2 V versus RHE, thereby outperforming the blank KHCO3 electrolyte (53.1%). This research underscores the crucial influence of anionic additives in the CO2RR.

Halloysite clay nanotubes (HNTs) are emerging nanomaterials for numerous environmental applications, including catalysis and biomass valorization. The efficacy of halloysite as a nanoplatform for the catalytic conversion of biomass can be accurately evaluated by combined approaches based on experimental investigations and computational modeling. Recently, many efforts have been made to properly describe the most peculiar features of halloysite by focusing on its structural and interfacial features through computational studies, which are challenging for natural clay nanoparticles yet crucial for the design of novel catalysts to be exploited in biomass conversion. Within this framework, this review critically and extensively discusses recent advancements related to the use of halloysite in different catalytic processes, such as enzymatic reactions, precious- and nonprecious-metal- and alloy-catalyzed reactions, and acid-activated mechanisms. The research gap on the computational modeling of biomass chemical conversion occurring on halloysite surfaces is highlighted throughout this review, together with the latest experimental achievements. To optimize the catalytic efficiency of halloysite-based materials for biomass valorization, future efforts should focus on the implementation of experimental data with calculations provided by proper models in a synergistic approach.
