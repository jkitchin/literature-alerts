Electronic perturbation induced by the microenvironment regulation adjacent to the FeN4 sites anchored on metal–N–C materials will accelerate its oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, we report a fine-tuning in the charge configuration of FeN4 sites through a defect-rich N/S-doped carbon nest derived from the chemically cross-linked pyrrole/thiophene copolymer (CCPPT) with a sp3-hybridized cross-linker. Compared with the pyrrole/thiophene copolymer (PPT) without the cross-linker, CCPPT with a knitted three-dimensional (3D) network delivers higher defect density and ∼2-fold sulfur retention after pyrolysis. The structural characterizations combined with theoretical calculations suggest that adjacent vacancy defects (Cvd) and FeN4/S2 moiety together induce the charge redistribution of the FeN4 sites on the resultant CC-Fe1/NSC from CCPPT, reducing the adsorption strength of the oxygen-containing intermediates and the energy barrier of ORR. As expected, CC-Fe1/NSC shows an impressive half-wave potential of ∼0.91 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing both the PPT-derived Fe1/NSC (0.88 V) and the commercial Pt/C (0.86 V). This work provides a distinctive path to manipulate the adjacent microenvironment of the single-atom catalysts toward ORR or even beyond.

Transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are essential in modern organic synthesis, facilitating the rapid creation of complex molecular structures. Traditionally, these reactions rely heavily on conventional bases, with only a few exceptions reported. Recently, we developed adaptive dynamic homogeneous catalysis (AD-HoC), a method that enables C(sp2)–S cross-couplings without needing traditional ligands, bases, or additives. Given the growing demand for protocols compatible with acidic conditions in metal-catalyzed cross-couplings, we revisited AD-HoC to pioneer acid-facilitated transition metal-catalyzed thioetherification. Our method enables the swift synthesis of thioethers using nickel and visible light, with a substoichiometric amount of Brønsted acid acting as an enabler. NMR kinetic studies indicate that in the absence of acid, the system displays an induction period characteristic of autocatalysis. Introducing the acid as a simple additive eliminates this induction period and significantly accelerates the reaction. Moreover, the protocol has been successfully scaled to gram-level synthesis using continuous flow technology, achieving productivities of over 100 g per hour in a commercially available lab-scale photoreactor. This highlights the method's robustness and scalability, making it a powerful tool for large-scale applications.

The electrochemical methods for asymmetric indolization are still elusive and pose a significant challenge. Taking advantage of 2-alkynylanilines as electrochemically compatible indolyl equivalents, we herein represent a mild and highly enantioselective electrocatalytic process for tandem C–H indolization to form 2,3′-biindolyl atropisomers along with hydrogen evolution reaction. Integrated experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that a sequential C–H metalation/nucleophilic cyclization/reductive elimination/anodic oxidation sequence involving a RhIII–RhI–RhIII catalytic cycle accounts for the established transformation.

## Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methanol on Pt(111) Modified with a Pd Monolayer

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to value-added, highly reduced chemicals such as methanol (CH3OH) is a promising possibility for producing renewable fuel and simultaneous CO2 recycling. However, this process remains a challenge, with only a few selective electrocatalysts known. Here, we present a study of a palladium monolayer on a platinum (111) single crystal (PdML/Pt(111)) as an electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion to CH3OH. A custom-made setup was employed in order to detect and quantify gaseous and liquid CO2 reduction products in sufficient concentrations despite the limitations of working with a single-crystalline electrode. Under ambient reaction conditions, a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 1.5% at −0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was obtained while using CO2 as the reactant. Other reaction intermediates, carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were subsequently used as reactants, leading to FEs of 1.8 and 2.5%, respectively, whereas formic acid is not reduced. The corresponding mechanism concluded from our work is compared to the literature. The electrocatalyst introduced here, with a highly well-defined structure for CO2 conversion to CH3OH, opens up possibilities for further catalytic explorations.

Axially chiral biaryl benzylamines are present in numerous natural products, pharmaceuticals, chiral ligands, and catalysts. However, the direct catalytic synthesis of these functional molecules using a robust strategy remains a formidable challenge. Reductive amination desymmetrization of biaryl dialdehydes offers a powerful approach for the construction of axially chiral biaryl benzylamines but suffers from extensive undesirable side reactions. Herein, we engineered ancestral imine reductases to enable reductive amination desymmetrization of biaryl dialdehydes, allowing the construction of a wide range of axially chiral biaryl benzylamines with up to 99% conversion and 99% enantiomeric excess (ee). The ratio of the product to byproducts was up to 97:3 and over 90:10 in most cases. This work presents an alternative strategy for accessing axially chiral biaryl benzylamines and will stimulate the development of associated bioactive molecules and catalysts/ligands.

The evolution of a promiscuous enzyme for its various activities often results in catalytically specialized variants. This is an important natural mechanism to ensure the proper functioning of natural metabolic networks. It also acts as both a curse and blessing for enzyme engineers, where enzymes that have undergone directed evolution may exhibit exquisite selectivity at the expense of a diminished overall catalytic repertoire. We previously performed two independent directed evolution campaigns on a promiscuous designer enzyme that leverages the unique properties of a noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) para-aminophenylalanine (pAF) as catalytic residue, resulting in two evolved variants which are both catalytically specialized. Here, we combine mutagenesis, crystallography, and computation to reveal the molecular basis of the specialization phenomenon. In one evolved variant, an unexpected change in quaternary structure biases substrate dynamics to promote enantioselective catalysis, while the other demonstrates synergistic cooperation between natural side chains and the pAF residue to form semisynthetic catalytic machinery.
