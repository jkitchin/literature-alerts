Selective semihydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene in ethylene-rich gas streams is a significant industrial process for obtaining high-quality polyethylene products. The conventional thermal hydrogenation route requires high temperature (>100 °C), excess H2, and noble metal Pd to achieve satisfactory conversion efficiency. Therefore, the development of a more efficient and economical low-energy method for acetylene semihydrogenation is greatly desired yet challenging. Here, we report a noble-metal-free molecular system consisting of a bioinspired [CoII(N4S2)](ClO4)2 catalyst and a copper photosensitizer, which achieves photocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene with over 96% selectivity and 96–99.9% conversion under ambient conditions for both pure acetylene and industrially relevant ethylene cofeed (containing 1% acetylene) conditions using water as a proton source. In addition, our catalytic system in deuterium oxide exhibits ability for deuterated ethylene production, which is an important building block for various deuterated polyolefins and chemicals.

The treatment of SARS-CoV-2 can be accomplished by effective suppression of its 3CL protease (3CLpro), also known as the main protease (Mpro) and nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5). Covalent inhibitors can irreversibly and selectively disable the protease, particularly when they are highly exothermic. Herein we investigated the distinct kinetic behaviors exhibited by two covalently linked SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. One of these inhibitors features a nitrile reactive group, while the other has this group replaced by an alkyne group, a less reactive electrophile. Our investigations involve the assessment of the free energy surfaces of the key feasible mechanisms: that is, direct and water-assisted mechanisms involved in the rate-determining proton-transfer nucleophilic attack step through the utilization of both ab initio and empirical valence bond (EVB) simulations. The calculated free energy profiles show that substituting the nitrile group with alkyne increases the chemical barrier but leads to very exothermic reaction energy and is an irreversible process as opposed to nitrile, which is moderately exothermic and reversible. We also examine the time dependence of IC50 inhibition by applying an innovative kinetic simulation approach, which is particularly important in studies of covalent inhibitors with a very exothermic bonding step. Our computational approach provides a good agreement between the calculated and observed values of the time dependence results for the nitrile and alkyne inhibitors. Our approach, which is rather unique in combining calculations of the chemical barriers and the binding energy is likely to be very effective in studies of the effectiveness of other covalent inhibitors related cases.

Methane (CH4) activation and conversion under mild reaction conditions are a great challenge for the chemical industry. Photocatalysis is attractive for activating inert C–H bonds of CH4 at room temperature. Specifically, photocatalytic nonoxidative coupling of CH4 (NOCM) is a promising process to produce ethane (C2-hydrocarbon) and H2. Different oxide-based photocatalysts have been used for room-temperature NOCM, and TiO2 is a potential photocatalyst with a bandgap that can capture photons in the UV region. However, a fundamental understanding of the NOCM mechanism on TiO2 is still missing. Herein, we apply multiscale modeling, combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to investigate the photocatalytic NOCM on a rutile TiO2(110) surface. DFT calculations revealed that the photogenerated holes mediate the homolytic activation of CH4 via the formation of methyl radicals with an activation barrier that is 70% lower than that of the conventional thermocatalytic route. The generated methyl radicals further recombine to form ethane. The detailed reaction pathway energetics investigated with DFT-based kMC simulations revealed that ethane can be formed at 315.15 K, but the dissociated hydrogens poison the catalyst surface. Further thermocatalytic simulations revealed that increasing the temperature by thermal heating (ca. 690.15 K) facilitated H2 formation and catalyst regeneration. Importantly, we demonstrate how photo- and thermocatalytic modes can be combined, facilitating NOCM on TiO2 and a route to enable dynamic catalysis simulations through multiscale modeling, opening alternative avenues in computational catalyst discovery.

Cytochromes P450 (P450s) commonly catalyze hydroxylation but can also be responsible for dehydrogenation reactions, important in drug metabolism and biosynthesis; the mechanism of the latter transformation remains poorly understood. The well-characterized bacterial CYP199A4 catalyzes both hydroxylation and dehydrogenation of p-alkylbenzoic acids and thus provides an ideal model system in which to investigate the mechanism of P450-catalyzed aliphatic dehydrogenation. Through use of enantioselectively deuterated probes, metabolite analysis, protein crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM (ONIOM) modeling, CYP199A4-catalyzed dehydrogenation was found to be completely enantioselective and postulated to occur through an asynchronous proton coupled electron transfer. No definitive evidence of a cationic intermediate was uncovered but instead, the positioning of the substrate was postulated to be key in directing the chemoselectivity of the reaction i.e., dehydrogenation versus hydroxylation. This knowledge could be exploited to control dehydrogenation in other P450s and helps explain the common occurrence of P450-desaturated drug metabolites alongside hydroxylated ones.

Redox enzymes, mostly equipped with metal or organic cofactors, can vary their reactivity with oxygen by orders of magnitude. Understanding how oxygen reactivity is controlled by the protein milieu remains an open issue, with broad implications for mechanistic enzymology and enzyme design. Here, we address this problem by focusing on a widespread group of flavoenzymes that oxidize phenolic compounds derived from microbial lignin degradation, using either oxygen or cytochrome c as an electron acceptor. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis revealed conserved amino acid motifs in the flavin-binding site. Using a combination of kinetic, mutagenesis, structural, and computational methods, we examined the role of these residues. Our results demonstrate that subtle and localized changes in the flavin environment can drastically impact oxygen reactivity. These effects are afforded through the creation or blockade of pathways for oxygen diffusion. Substrate binding plays a crucial role by potentially obstructing oxygen access to the flavin, thus influencing the enzyme's reactivity. The switch between oxidase and dehydrogenase functionalities is thereby achieved through targeted, site-specific amino acid replacements that finely tune the microenvironment around the flavin. Our findings explain how very similar enzymes can exhibit distinct functional properties, operating as oxidases or dehydrogenases. They further provide valuable insights for the rational design and engineering of enzymes with tailored functions.

Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs), usually the melon phase, have been extensively applied as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction; however, their performance is still unsatisfactory. The condensed allotrope, namely, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) with extended conjugation and a crystallized structure, indeed holds more favorable compositional and structural advantages for photocatalytic CO2 reduction but remains to be fully exploited. Herein, hexagonal prism-shaped PTI crystals were synthesized and developed as a high-performance photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. With Co(bpy)32+ as a cocatalyst, the PTI crystals exhibit a CO evolution rate of 44 μmol h–1 (i.e., 1467 μmol g–1 h–1) with 93% selectivity, markedly superior to that of the melon counterpart. Moreover, PTI crystals manifest an apparent quantum efficiency of 12.9% at 365 nm, representing the state-of-the-art value by PCN photocatalysts for CO2-to-CO reduction without using noble metals. The surface pyridine N species of PTI are exposed as active sites to dominate CO2 activation and conversion, which, together with the high crystallinity to facilitate charge separation and transport, endows high CO2 reduction efficiency. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy determines the key intermediates during the CO2 reduction reaction and, consequently, constructs the possible reaction mechanism.

The hydrogenation of CO2 into high-value chemistry is seen as one of the viable strategies for solving the energy crisis of the future. Light olefins have attracted considerable attention as basic feedstocks in the industry. In this work, a series of Fe–Co bimetallic active site catalysts were constructed by a typical sol–gel strategy. The synergistic regulation layout of the Fe–Co bimetallic active site catalyst constructed highly active interfaces and exhibited high conversion (56.9%) of CO2, low CO selectivity (3.6%), high selectivity (40.5%) of light olefins, and remarkable light olefins yield (22.2%). The results of the associated characterization analysis indicate that the high activity interfaces formed by the synergistic regulation layout of the Fe–Co bimetallic active sites are the fundamental reason for the high yield of light olefins. The high activity interfaces formed by the introduction of cobalt drive the RWGS reaction forward (Le Chatelier's Principle), which further enhances the CO2 conversion. In addition, the dynamic evolution of the physical phase structure, elemental composition and valence, CO2 and H2 adsorption ability, and the formation process of light olefins during the reaction of Fe–Co bimetallic catalysts were analyzed by in situ DRIFT spectra and other characterizations, and a potential mechanism for the high selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins is further proposed. This work provides an effective and rational design strategy for the synergistic regulation layout of Fe–Co bimetals with highly active interfaces to promote efficient hydrogenation of CO2 for the oriented synthesis of light olefins.

Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), a predominant technology for large-scale industrial hydrogen production, faces limitations in commercialization owing to the inadequate catalytic activity and stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. This study introduces a NiFeAl self-supported electrode characterized by high activity and stability for the OER and outlines a rational design strategy for NiFe (oxy)hydroxide-based self-supported electrodes. The introduction of Al, a ternary dopant with relatively low electronegativity and a small ionic radius, into the NiFe electrode effectively controls the adsorption energy of O-intermediates and facilitates the deprotonation of adsorbed OH*, thereby accelerating the OER. Remarkably, the NiFeAl self-supported electrode demonstrates approximately 50% enhanced operational activity (0.71 A cm–2 at 1.8 V) compared to NiFe alongside exceptional stability (>72 h at 0.6 A cm–2) in OER within an AWE single cell. These findings highlight the significant potential of the NiFeAl electrode for application in AWE for efficient, large-scale hydrogen production.

High deuteration yields are difficult to attain with conventional chemical synthesis methods. In this work, we demonstrate that deuterated chemicals can be produced using electrochemical CO2 reduction in the presence of D2O. The absence of H2O enables deuteration yields over 99% for products such as ethanol-d6 and formate-d. With a D2O solvent, the competing D2 evolution reaction is completely suppressed at low current densities while being kept <10% at a higher 300 mA/cm2.

TiO2-supported Au nanocatalysts are highly attractive for the water gas shift (WGS) reaction due to their high catalytic activity at low temperatures. Herein, the (Au/TiO2–x)OP catalyst synthesized by the combination of warm and cold plasmas exhibits a high WGS reaction rate of 1.63 mol·gAu–1·h–1 at 120 °C, being one of the highest WGS rates among Au/TiO2 catalysts. The warm plasma generates a large amount of oxygen vacancies, while the cold plasma treatment generates small Au nanoparticles and interfacial sites. The (Au/TiO2–x)OP catalyst features two kinds of abundant active sites including Auδ+-Oδ−-Ti4+ and Au0-Ov-Ti3+, which accelerate the WGS reaction simultaneously along the intermediate and redox reaction pathways, respectively.

This study describes a photoredox/cobalt dual-catalyzed asymmetric Grignard-type addition reaction, enabling the synthesis of axially chiral hexatomic (six–six) N-heterobiaryls bearing the extra chiral secondary alcohol unit via an efficient dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of racemic N-heterobiaryl triflate substrates. The conversion facilitated via both photoredox and classical reductive reaction conditions exhibits good functional group tolerance, a broad substrate scope, and satisfactory stereoselectivity. Furthermore, control experiments and density functional theory calculations provide preliminary mechanistic insights.
