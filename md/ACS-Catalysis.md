The structural elucidation of chiral rare-earth-based catalysts in asymmetric reactions holds significant importance as it is crucial for comprehending their operational mechanisms and for broadening their applications in the realm of asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a LaIII/(L3-RaMe3)2 complex was identified to be more active and enantioselective than LaIII/L3-RaMe3 in the asymmetric formal substitution of racemic 3-bromo-3-substituted oxindoles with TMSCN. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations disclosed that the partial dissociation of the chiral N,N′-dioxide ligand was involved in the catalytic process with LaIII/(L3-RaMe3)2. These insights provided a rationale for the remarkable effect of catalyst structures on the results and nonlinear effect observed in the current reaction system. This protocol offers a straightforward and efficient pathway to synthesize various chiral 3-cyano-3-substituted oxindoles (53 examples, up to 99% yield, 98% ee). In addition, the synthesis of a bioactive compound CRTH2 receptor antagonist and obvious inhibitory effect of several products on the viability of cancer cells demonstrate the potential utility of this methodology.

Elucidating the relationship between electrocatalytic activity and surface strain is pivotal for designing highly efficient electrocatalysts for the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, a general correlation is currently absent due to the lack of ideal catalytic materials platforms with well-defined structures and components. Herein, we select L10 and L12 Pt-based intermetallic compounds as model materials to construct a series of core–shell catalysts with strained Pt skins (IMC@Pt) and establish the correlation between surface strain and HER performance. Density functional theory calculations were performed to determine the surface strain degree, d-band center, and key descriptor ΔGH* of the catalysts for HER. By combining theoretical and experimental data, we propose a volcano-type trend between surface strain and the HER activity of IMC@Pt with an apex at 4% compressive strain. In addition, we demonstrate a class of highly active and durable IMC@Pt catalysts for acidic HER. Among them, the Pt3V@Pt catalyst exhibits the highest intrinsic HER activity with a specific activity of 4.24 mA cmPt–2 at an overpotential of 20 mV, which is 4 times higher than that of Pt. This work provides a solid understanding of the essential nature of PtM alloy catalysts and can guide the design of high-performance HER catalysts for water electrolyzers.

Terpenoids are an intriguing class of natural products with diverse structures and biological activities whose complexity stems in large part from terpene synthases (TPSs). These enzymes catalyze carbocationic cascade reactions wherein the groups responsible for quenching the final carbocation are generally not well-known. IrKSL3a and IrTPS2 from Isodon rubescens share 98% sequence homology but use distinct quenching strategies, with IrKSL3a catalyzing direct deprotonation to generate the olefin isopimaradiene while IrTPS2 adds water to yield the hydroxylated nezukol. In this work, we discovered a threonine and serine that hydrogen-bond the water to be added in IrTPS2. Site-directed mutagenesis and multiscale QM/MM simulations of modeled structures further reveal that the binding of this water is blocked by the introduction of a β-methyl-containing side chain in a neighboring residue. From these insights, it was then possible to engineer IrKSL3a to generate nezukol, with other new hydroxylated products also observed. Inspired by these mechanistic insights into the functional plasticity of IrKSL3a and IrTPS2, we explored the plausible evolutionary relationship of these kaurene synthase-like (KSL) TPSs, as well as prospective utilization of these plasticity sites discovered in IrTPS2/IrKSL3a. Such experiments with a variety of more phylogenetically distant KSLs demonstrated that these residues are necessary but not sufficient to efficiently introduce such an addition of water, emphasizing the selective pressure underlying the extended evolutionary process for the production of nezukol by IrTPS2.

Photoreforming of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) wastes to high-value-added chemicals is an emerging and promising approach. Nonetheless, a major obstacle is the harsh alkaline pretreatment (COH– = 5–10 M) to depolymerize PET, resulting in a surge in processing costs and also posing great challenges to subsequent photocatalytic devices, catalysts, and photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we introduce a tandem process of chemical depolymerization and photoreforming of waste PET plastics. Depolymerization of PET to monomers is achieved through an intramolecular hydrolysis mechanism on a binuclear zinc catalyst under mild conditions (COH– ≤ 0.1 M and T ≤ 60 °C). Compared with the traditional harsh alkali pretreatment, the depolymerization rate can be increased by nearly an order of magnitude due to the proximity effect of the bimetallic sites. Technoeconomic analysis shows that processing 50,000 tons of plastic annually can save 15.2 million USD. The photoreforming of PET to formic acid and H2 with an impressive production rate of 2000 μmol gcat–1 h–1 was achieved on an ultrasmall carbon nitride nanosphere photocatalyst, which is nearly 5-fold higher than the corresponding strong alkali pretreatment system. Mechanism research reveals high photocatalytic activity thanks to the mild PET pretreatment and the efficient electron–hole separation caused by the ultrasmall carbon nitride nanosphere size structure and the electron capture effect of metal Pt. We also demonstrate a gram-scale integrated process for real-world PET plastic wastes including water bottles, clothing fibers, towels, carpets, and mixed plastics containing PET. Our study establishes a new concept of tandem catalysis to reduce the harsh pretreatment of PET by using a synthetic catalyst in polyester plastic photoreforming technology.

In 1954, Mars and van Krevelen proposed the famous “redox” mechanism to rationalize the oxidation of hydrocarbons (HCs) over vanadium oxide catalysts. According to this mechanism, the reduction of oxide catalysts (hydrogen abstraction, dehydroxylation, and metal–oxygen bond cleavage) are kinetically relevant in most cases, and oxides with high reducibility can be made into catalysts with high activity for HC (deep) oxidation. Such a framework, however, cannot explain the fact that Pr6O11 with the most liable lattice oxygen among lanthanide oxides is a worse low-temperature propylene oxidizer than CeO2. In this article, by comparing the kinetic/isotopic performance and the reduction/reoxidation behavior of rod-like CeO2 and Pr6O11 counterparts during lean propylene catalytic combustion, it was suggested that both these lanthanide oxides ignited propylene via a classical redox mechanism, while the reactive oxygen species involved in their following reactions were quite different. Specifically, the reactions over Pr6O11 were limited by the replenishment of lattice oxygen─the consistent workhorse reactive phase of this catalyst, and could be effectively accelerated at elevated temperature with a drastic dropping in the apparent activation energy (Eaapp, from 75.9 to 60.1 kJ/mol). In contrast, due to the relatively low electrochemical reduction potential of Ce4+/Ce3+ (1.74 eV) than that of Pr4+/Pr3+ (3.2 eV), the propylene-induced defective sites (e.g., Ce3+–VO) on CeO2–x readily donated Ce3+ 4f1 electrons to adsorbed O2 during the reoxidation steps in the redox cycles, giving rise to adsorbed oxygen species like O22– and O–. These electrophilic Oxn– species played active roles in the following reduction steps. Benefited from the “shallow” reactive region and therefore multiplied redox cycles of CeO2, such an “Oxn–-assisted” Mars–van Krevelen mechanism led to low Eaapp (∼43 kJ/mol) values close to those obtained on platinum catalysts.

Selective acetylene partial hydrogenation in an ethylene-rich stream plays a crucial industrial role in removing acetylene impurities from ethylene produced through hydrocarbon cracking. In this study, we investigated the distinct promotional effects of Ag and amorphous polyphenylene sulfide (Am-PPS) on Pd catalysts. The addition of Ag increased the electron density of Pd and reduced the size of the Pd ensemble, effectively inhibiting undesired side reactions, such as the overhydrogenation of ethylene to ethane and the hydro-oligomerization of acetylene into C4 and heavier paraffins (green oil). However, alloying with inactive Ag resulted in a reduced number of surface-exposed active Pd atoms, leading to a significant decrease in catalytic activity. On the other hand, surface modification of Pd with Am-PPS was very effective in suppressing ethylene overhydrogenation without compromising acetylene hydrogenation activity. Furthermore, it facilitated the removal of green oil from the catalyst surface before its transformation into coke, significantly retarding the catalyst deactivation. This can be attributed to the rapid cleaning of ethylene and green oil from the Pd surface through the competitive adsorption of the Am-PPS polymer chains. The advantages of each promoter can be synergistically combined through dual promotion. The resulting catalyst exhibited moderate activity, along with exceptionally high ethylene selectivity, and suppressed formation of carbonaceous deposits (both green oil and coke). These findings demonstrate the unique potential to design advanced selective hydrogenation catalysts by leveraging the advantages of both inorganic and organic promoters.

Regulating the spatial twist angle of flexible geometry is an effective strategy to enhance the spatial overlap in organic semiconductors and provide transfer channels for electron transfer. However, the internal migration rates of macromolecular polymers with flexible geometries and complex compositions are severely restricted, making them elusive and easily overlooked. Here, different configurations of donor–acceptor (D–A)-based perylene diimide (PDI) polymers have been elaborately designed and prepared. In fact, the high crystallinity and molecular polarity of coplanar semiconductors lead to a differentiated charge distribution and carrier transfer site, which opens the prelude for charge transfer and exciton dissociation. More importantly, the unique π-conjugated D–A configuration not only provides a smooth carrier transfer channel for promoting intermolecular electron transfer rates but is also conducive to the adsorption, diffusion, and charge exchange and activation of nitric acid as well as reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier. Ultimately, the coplanar configuration of PDI-connected 3,3-diaminobenzidine polymers (D-PDI) exhibited efficient photocatalytic nitrate reduction activity without the use of a cocatalyst and sacrificial agent. Our work provides fresh insights into molecular structure regulation to develop efficient photocatalysts for solving environmental problems.

Although the transition metal-catalyzed radical fluorine atom transfer (FAT) strategy has emerged as a powerful tool for the construction of C–F bonds, to our knowledge, this approach has rarely been applied to the formation of S–F bonds. Here, we report that 4-methoxypyridine 1-oxide can serve as an inexpensive and simple yet effective ligand and thus promote the transformation of the copper-mediated challengeable radical FAT to sulfonyl radicals, paving the way for the assembly of an FSO2 group. Based on this concept, three Cu(I)-catalyzed protocols involving site-selective intra- and intermolecular fluorosulfonylation of inert C(sp3)–H bonds and 1,2-aminofluorosulfonylation of inactivated alkenes have been developed, enabling the preparation of C(sp3)-rich aliphatic sulfonyl fluorides that cannot be easily synthesized by known methods. These practical and operationally simple methods result in high functional group tolerance under mild conditions and can be applied to the modification of bioactive derivatives and preparation of highly valued molecules. Detailed mechanistic studies indicate the unique role of the 4-methoxypyridine 1-oxide ligand in facilitating the formation of such rare radical FATs via an outer-sphere pathway.

The reconstruction of ancestral sequences can offer a glimpse into the fascinating process of molecular evolution by exposing the adaptive pathways that shape the proteins found in nature today. Here, we track the evolution of the carbohydrate-active enzymes responsible for the synthesis and turnover of mannogen, a critical carbohydrate reserve in Leishmania parasites. Biochemical characterization of resurrected enzymes demonstrated that mannoside phosphorylase activity emerged in an ancestral bacterial mannosyltransferase, and later disappeared in the process of horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication in Leishmania. By shuffling through plausible historical sequence space in an ancestral mannosyltransferase, we found that mannoside phosphorylase activity could be toggled on through various combinations of mutations at positions outside of the active site. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that such mutations can affect loop rigidity and shield the active site from water molecules that disrupt key interactions, allowing α-mannose 1-phosphate to adopt a catalytically productive conformation. These findings highlight the importance of subtle distal mutations in protein evolution and suggest that the vast collection of natural glycosyltransferases may be a promising source of engineering templates for the design of tailored phosphorylases.

Nucleosides are ubiquitous to life and are required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and other molecules crucial for cell survival. Despite the notoriously difficult organic synthesis of nucleosides, 2′-deoxynucleoside analogues can interfere with natural DNA replication and repair and are successfully employed as anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial compounds. Nucleoside 2′-deoxyribosyltransferase (dNDT) enzymes catalyze transglycosylation via a covalent 2′-deoxyribosylated enzyme intermediate with retention of configuration, having applications in the biocatalytic synthesis of 2′-deoxynucleoside analogues in a single step. Here, we characterize the structure and function of a thermophilic dNDT, the protein from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis (CtNDT). We combined enzyme kinetics with structural and biophysical studies to dissect mechanistic features in the reaction coordinate, leading to product formation. Bell-shaped pH-rate profiles demonstrate activity in a broad pH range of 5.5–9.5, with two very distinct pKa values. A pronounced viscosity effect on the turnover rate indicates a diffusional step, likely product (nucleobase1) release, to be rate-limiting. Temperature studies revealed an extremely curved profile, suggesting a large negative activation heat capacity. We trapped a 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxyarabinosyl-enzyme intermediate by mass spectrometry and determined high-resolution structures of the protein in its unliganded, substrate-bound, ribosylated, 2′-difluoro-2′-deoxyribosylated, and in complex with probable transition-state analogues. We reveal key features underlying (2′-deoxy)ribonucleoside selection, as CtNDT can also use ribonucleosides as substrates, albeit with a lower efficiency. Ribonucleosides are the building blocks of RNA and other key intracellular metabolites participating in energy and metabolism, expanding the scope of use of CtNDT in biocatalysis.

Understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and activity is crucial to advancing catalytic processes such as CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. In this study, we investigated the impact of various synthesis conditions on the structural properties and catalytic activity of ZnO–ZrO2 solid solution (ZnZrOx) catalysts. By systematically adjusting the drying method, calcination temperature, postsynthesis ball-milling time, and use of additives, we synthesized a series of ZnZrOx catalysts with varying surface area (4.5–106 m2 g–1) and surface oxygen content [O/(Zn + Zr) = 1.60–2.04] and similar surface Zn content [Zn/(Zn + Zr) = ca. 0.20]. Our experimental and computational studies revealed that methanol synthesis over ZnZrOx catalysts is structure-sensitive and that area-normalized activity is positively correlated with the oxygen content on the catalyst surface. The surface lattice oxygen (O2–) played a crucial role in H2 activation, which is the rate-determining step for methanol formation; therefore, oxygen-rich regimes serve as the main active sites for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. From a fundamental point of view, this study highlights the importance of surface oxygen content for catalytic activity, which has been previously overlooked. From an engineering standpoint, our investigations suggest that ZnZrOx catalysts bearing oxygen-rich surfaces combined with high surface areas can exhibit desirable catalytic activity, thus guiding the rational synthesis strategy to the development of oxide-based hydrogenation catalysts.

The effectiveness of surface synergetic oxygen vacancy (SSOV) on a catalyst has been proposed in the selective reduction of NO to N2 by CO. In this work, we prepared fresh CuMn2O4 spinel catalyst using the freeze-assisted sol–gel method, and then engineered SSOVs through CO pretreatment (CO–CuMn2O4) at 250 °C. The catalytic performance of the CO–CuMn2O4 catalyst showed significant improvement, attributed to the presence of SSOVs, in comparison to that of the fresh CuMn2O4 sample. Additionally, our findings elucidated the limited reactivity of surface oxygen vacancies (SOVs) on a single metal oxide, emphasizing the crucial role played by SSOVs. Experimental results, including NO temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectrometry and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, provided further insights by suggesting that SSOVs facilitate the formation of N2O and its subsequent decomposition into N2. Density functional theory calculations have unveiled the pivotal role of SSOV in stabilizing the nitrogen atom derived from gaseous NO, facilitating the NO + CO → N* + CO2 reaction. Notably, the energy barrier for this process is only 0.54 eV, which is the rate-determining step of the NO + CO reaction. In stark contrast, this reaction scarcely occurs on the SOVs of single CuO and Mn2O3 surfaces. Furthermore, the presence of SSOVs considerably lowers the energy barrier for the conversion of N2O to N2, with a minimal barrier of 0.12 eV. In contrast, the reduction of N2O by CO without SSOV assistance necessitates a significantly higher energy barrier of 2.77 eV. Extending our investigation, we engineered SSOVs on the CuFe2O4 spinel catalyst and observed similar SSOV-mediated effects in the NO + CO reaction. Our research offers a comprehensive understanding of atomic-level role of SSOV, thereby offering valuable insights for the design of efficient NO + CO catalysts.

Developing high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative in facilitating large-scale production of hydrogen. Herein, we develop an atomically dispersed catalyst, Ir–Ni2P/CPDs, in which iridium single atoms are dual-anchored by both carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) and Ni2P. CPDs serve as electronic bridges, which facilitate the construction of high-density oxygen bridge structures, leading to high loading of isolated Ir atoms that act as the principal active sites for HER and OER. The resultant Ir–Ni2P/CPD catalyst demonstrates low overpotentials of only 25 ± 1 and 240 ± 2 mV at 10 mA cm–2 for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively, surpassing those of commercial Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts. Moreover, it exhibits robust long-term catalytic stability. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the bonding environment of dual-anchored isolated Ir sites plays an essential role in optimizing the adsorption and desorption kinetics of hydrogen/oxygen intermediates. This work extends a strategy for the design of high-loaded metal single-atom electrocatalysts for greatly facilitating HER and OER activities.

The unmatched chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of enzymes renders them powerful catalysts in the synthesis of chiral active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Inspired by the discovery route toward the LPA1-antagonist BMS-986278, access to the API building block (1S,3R)-3-hydroxycyclohexanecarbonitrile was envisaged using an ene reductase (ER) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to set both stereocenters. Starting from the commercially available cyclohexene-1-nitrile, a C–H oxyfunctionalization step was required to introduce the ketone functional group, yet several chemical allylic oxidation strategies proved unsuccessful. Enzymatic strategies for allylic oxidation are underdeveloped, with few examples on selected substrates with cytochrome P450s and unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs). In this case, UPOs were found to catalyze the desired allylic oxidation with high chemo- and regioselectivity, at substrate loadings of up to 200 mM, without the addition of organic cosolvents, thus enabling the subsequent ER and ADH steps in a three-step one-pot cascade. UPOs even displayed unreported enantioselective oxyfunctionalization and overoxidation of the substituted cyclohexene. After screening of enzyme panels, the final product was obtained at titers of 85% with 97% ee and 99% de, with a substrate loading of 50 mM, the ER being the limiting step. This synthetic approach provides the first example of a three-step, one-pot UPO-ER-ADH cascade and highlights the potential for UPOs to catalyze diverse enantioselective allylic hydroxylations and oxidations that are otherwise difficult to achieve.

The absence of a synthetic catalyst that can selectively oxidize methane to methanol motivates extensive study of single-site catalysts that possess a high degree of tunability in their coordination environments and share similarities with natural enzymes that can catalyze this reaction. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), in particular doped graphitic SACs, have emerged as a promising family of materials due to their high atom economy and scalability, but SACs are yet to be exhaustively screened for methane-to-methanol conversion. Modulating the coordination environment near single metal sites by means of codopants, we carry out a large-scale high-throughput virtual screen of 2048 transition metal (i.e., Mn, Fe, Co, and Ru) SACs codoped with various elements (i.e., N, O, P, and S) in numerous spin and oxidation (i.e., M(II)/M(III)) states for the challenging conversion of methane to methanol. We identify that the ground-state preference is metal- and oxidation-state-dependent. We observe a weak negative correlation between the oxo formation energy (ΔE(oxo)) and the energy of hydrogen atom transfer (ΔE(HAT)), thanks to the high variability in the coordination environment. Therefore, codoped SACs demonstrate flexible tunability that disrupts linear free energy relationships in a manner similar to that of homogeneous catalysts without losing the scalability of heterogeneous catalysts. We identify energetically favorable catalyst candidates along the Pareto frontier of ΔE(oxo) and ΔE(HAT). Further kinetic analysis reveals an intermediate-spin Fe(II) SAC and a low-spin Ru(II) SAC as promising candidates that merit further experimental exploration.

Near-infrared light occupies 54.3% of the solar spectrum and has greater penetration depth, and its effective utilization is of great significance in the practical application of photocatalysis on a larger scale. However, the development of catalysts that can directly utilize near-infrared light is still a huge challenge. This paper proposes a strategy to directly utilize near-infrared light (excitation wavelength extending to 850 nm) by creating carbon material doped with a high-spin-state Co(II)-Nx single-atom site. In the near-infrared-light-irradiated photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene, the yield of juglone can reach 45% without a significant decrease, even when the catalytic volume is increased by 20 times, which was much higher than that irradiated by 460 nm wavelength (reduced by about 23%). Our study sets the stage for fabricating stable NIR photocatalysts and provides a solution to directly enhance NIR photooxidation in a large-scale manner.

Controlling the electrochemical CO2 reduction process for multicarbon production is challenging. Ethanol is typically produced with lower selectivity compared to ethylene. In addition, ill-defined catalytic active sites and elusive mechanisms of C–C coupling further hinder the enhancement of ethanol generation. Here, we carefully regulated the quantity of the Cu atoms and deposited them onto a Ag inverse-opal structure (AgIOs) using the pulse-electrodeposition method. Subnanometer Cu clusters demonstrated a 2.5 times higher Faradaic efficiency for ethanol production compared to that for ethylene at −1.05 V vs RHE. Conversely, as the size of Cu increased to nanometers, ethylene became the dominant product. Excessive adsorption of CO on Cu clusters, which migrates from the Ag surface, is attributed to the improved ethanol production. Abundant Ag/Cu boundaries and adjacent spacing between Ag and Cu clusters may enhance the surface migration of CO. In contrast, the preferential site-selective CO adsorption on large Cu nanoparticles is associated with solution-mediated CO migration. Operando shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) revealed a high coverage of the CO on the Cu clusters. The initial intermediate *OCCOH by C–C coupling appeared for both Cu clusters and nanoparticles. However, Cu clusters accommodated more carbonaceous intermediates, highlighting the critical role of CO and intermediate coverages on Cu in ethanol production.

Metal hydrides (MHs) are featured for their reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption properties, which are conventionally used as hydrogen storage materials. MHs can also be used for catalysis, particularly for chemical reactions that involve hydrogen. This Review summarizes the historical and recent progress in the catalytic application of MHs. The focus topic is how the reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of MHs enable their catalytic effect in hydrogen involving chemical reactions. We start with the basic properties of MHs, and their applications in hydrogen storage and related fields. The application of MHs in four important catalytic reactions: olefin hydrogenation, reversible hydrogen storage in liquid organic hydrogen carriers, CO2 hydrogenation, and NH3 synthesis are discussed. Finally, we compare MH-based catalysts with their analogues, including hydrogen spillover, oxyhydrides, mixed-anion hydrides, and electrides in catalysis. The Review demonstrates the inherent relationship between MH catalysis and their intrinsic hydrogen absorption and desorption properties, providing insights into diverse applications of MHs beyond hydrogen storage.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction on Cu is a promising approach to produce value-added chemicals using renewable feedstocks, yet various Cu preparations have led to differences in activity and selectivity toward single and multicarbon products. Here, we find, surprisingly, that the effective catalytic activity toward ethylene improves when there is a larger fraction of less active sites acting as reservoirs of *CO on the surface of Cu nanoparticle electrocatalysts. In an adaptation of chemical transient kinetics to electrocatalysis, we measure the dynamic response of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) cell when the feed gas is abruptly switched between Ar (inert) and CO. When switching from Ar to CO, CO reduction (COR) begins promptly, but when switching from CO to Ar, COR can be maintained for several seconds (delay time) despite the absence of the CO reactant in the gas phase. A three-site microkinetic model captures the observed dynamic behavior and shows that Cu catalysts exhibiting delay times have a less active *CO reservoir that exhibits fast diffusion to active sites. The observed delay times and the estimated *CO reservoir sizes are affected by catalyst preparation, applied potential, and microenvironment (electrolyte cation identity, electrolyte pH, and CO partial pressure). Notably, we estimate that the *CO reservoir surface coverage can be as high as 88 ± 7% on oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) at high overpotentials (−1.52 V vs SHE) and this increases in reservoir coverage coincide with increased turnover frequencies to ethylene. We also estimate that *CO can travel substantial distances (up to 10s of nm) prior to desorption or reaction. It appears that active C–C coupling sites by themselves do not control selectivity to C2+ products in electrochemical COR; the supply of CO to those sites is also a crucial factor. More generally, the overall activity of Cu electrocatalysts cannot be approximated from linear combinations of individual site activities. Future designs must consider the diversity of the catalyst network and account for intersite transportation pathways.
