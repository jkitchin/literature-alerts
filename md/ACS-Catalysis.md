The nanomaterial-catalyzed oxidation of glucose can produce H2O2 or H2O as the oxygen reduction products. However, the theoretical model predicting the selection between H2O2 and H2O products is still lacking, which limits the rational design of aerobic glucose oxidation nanocatalysts for H2O2-targeted applications in disease diagnoses and therapies. In this work, a mechanism-driven prediction model that can predict whether a nanocatalyst preferably undergoes the 2e-catalysis to produce H2O2 or the 4e-catalysis to produce H2O is developed. The development of the model is first based on the reaction thermodynamics, and then a correction constant is introduced in conjunction with experimental reports to compensate to some extent for the lack of consideration of other influencing factors such as the reaction kinetics. The predictive power of the model is verified by density functional theory investigations on the mechanisms and kinetics of the experimentally reported noble metal nanocatalysts. Using the model, binary alloy nanomaterials, which preferably undergo 2e-catalysis to produce H2O2, have been predicted. This work provides theoretical guidelines for the rational design of aerobic glucose oxidation nanocatalysts capable of producing H2O2 and facilitates their application in H2O2-targeted biomedicine.

Chemical looping oxidative coupling of methane (CL-OCM) presents a promising route for light olefin production, offering a simpler alternative to conventional methane steam reforming approaches. The selection of the redox catalyst used in CL-OCM is critical since it must achieve high C2+ yields (>25%) while maintaining longevity in harsh reaction environments. We present a comprehensive performance evaluation and characterization of an understudied, yet highly effective redox catalyst capable of achieving and maintaining a C2+ yield of 26.8% at 840 °C. Through extensive ex situ and in situ analyses, including X-ray diffraction, near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), and Raman spectroscopy, we have characterized the catalyst and identified two distinct bulk, crystalline phases: cubic LixMg6–xMnO8 and orthorhombic Mg3–xMnx(BO3)O2. Calcination at 1200 °C, as opposed to a typical calcination temperature of 900 °C, increased the orthoborate oxide phase to ∼45 wt % while reducing the BET surface area by 65%. By investigating performance differences between these catalysts in their "sintered" and "presintered" states, we have unveiled surprising cooperative effects between the two phases. Experiments with physical mixing of these two phases (granular stacking and mortar mixing) revealed that observed differences in CL-OCM efficacy cannot be solely due to sintering-induced loss of surface area but are also the result of synergistic, dual-phase interactions that enhance overall C2+ yield. H2-temperature programmed reduction measurements and ex situ XPS analysis demonstrate that the sintered catalyst has a lower average Mn-oxidation state, enabling more selective lattice oxygen release and limiting overoxidation to COx species. Additionally, NAP-XPS and in situ Raman characterization suggest that boron–oxygen coordinated sites (BOx) may also play a role in improving selectivity. Leveraging insights from our phase mixture CL-OCM performance tests, steady-state experiments with cofed O2, and corroborative in situ characterizations, we propose that the synergistic interplay between LixMg6–xMnO8 and Mg3–xMnx(BO3)O2 may be the result of facile oxygen release from the more redox-active LixMg6–xMnO8 phase combined with Li+ migration to the orthoborate oxide phase.    

    

## Unraveling the Effect of Dopants in Zirconia-Based Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol

The doping of zirconia to enhance its activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has been studied intensively in experiments, but a thorough theoretical understanding of the factors that decide whether a dopant has a positive or negative influence on the reactivity is lacking. In this work, we conduct a mechanistic investigation using density functional theory and microkinetic modeling, considering the ZrO2(101) surface doped with 16 different metals. This analysis elucidates the following two criteria for enhanced reactivity. One, the ability of the surface to facilitate the dissociation of H2 and provide the H* species necessary for the catalytic reaction is deemed a necessary but not sufficient criterion. Two, dopants that are thermodynamically stable under reaction conditions in a 2+ or 3+ oxidation state are beneficial, since this entails the introduction of O vacancies, which stabilize O-containing reaction intermediates such as formate and lower key transition states. We construct linear scaling relations that can reliably predict transition state energies in terms of less computationally costly adsorption energies. It is revealed that dopants that are stable in the 4+ state (e.g., Ti), and thereby lack O vacancies, follow a different scaling relation with a higher intercept for formate formation, which can explain their reduced reactivity. Overall, our microkinetic models can successfully predict the trends for dopants that have been found active in experiments (Zn2+, Cd2+, Ga3+, In3+) and not. Together with the established reactivity criteria, this paves the way for computational screening of oxides for the important CO2-to-methanol process.    

    

## Intermolecular Anti-Markovnikov Hydroamination of Alkenes with Sulfonamides, Sulfamides, and Sulfamates

A general method for the light-driven intermolecular anti-Markovnikov hydroamination of alkenes with primary sulfonamides, sulfamides, and sulfamates is presented. The reaction is mediated by a ternary catalyst system composed of an iridium(III) chromophore, a fluorinated alkoxide base, and a thiol H-atom donor. We hypothesize that the reactions proceed via a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism wherein implementation of the alkoxide base imparts additional thermochemical driving force for the homolytic activation of strong N–H bonds that were previously inaccessible using this methodology. This furnishes electrophilic N-centered radicals that subsequently interface with a wide range of unactivated alkenes for C–N bond formation. This protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope and great functional group tolerance, further highlighting the advantages of excited-state PCET as a platform for catalytic radical generation from common organic functional groups.

A comprehensive understanding of the intricate surface environments of practical nanocatalysts at the atomic level is essential for advancing our knowledge of catalytic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate PtCu octahedral nanoparticles with varying microstrains engineered by Cu dispersion. A detailed analysis of the atom configuration and corresponding microstrain is conducted. The intimate mixing of Cu and Pt results in increased randomness in atom displacement within the lattice and a more pronounced distribution of alternating microstrain on the surfaces. Specifically, we observe that the PtCu concave octahedral nanoparticles with alternating microstrain demonstrate a substantial oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of 3.95 mA cm–2 in area-specific activity. The significant impact of shear microstrain is further underscored, as evidenced by an 86.9% decrease in the ORR activity upon the removal of the alternating shear microstrain. This study sheds light on the effects of microstrain toward the ORR and provides valuable insights into designing advanced Pt-based electrocatalysts.

Dual-atom catalysts have garnered widespread attention for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet achieving an in-depth comprehension of the reaction mechanism and the structure–activity relationship remains challenging. Herein, carbon nanosheets with FeCo–N6 active sites (FeCo-NCNS) are prepared via a straightforward self-sacrificing template and cascade anchoring strategy. Delicate structural control enables hierarchical porosity, providing adequate active site density (2.5 × 1019 sites g–1) and fast mass transfer, as revealed by in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy. Moreover, the structural and chemical origin of the dual-atom site for enhanced ORR activity is uncovered. FeCo–N6 can be spontaneously transformed to an oxygen-bridging structure (FeCo–N6–O) in the KOH electrolyte, triggering improved charge polarization, downshifted d-band center, and optimized adsorption behavior for oxygen-intermediates, thereby reducing the free energy barrier. Therefore, the FeCo-NCNS exhibits enhanced ORR activity regarding the half-wave potential (0.90 V), mass specific kinetic current density (9.54 A g–1), turnover frequency (2.35 e– site–1 s–1), and improved stability. This work not only provides an effective methodology to construct efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversation but also highlights the dynamic structural evolution and charge polarization in improving the electrocatalytic activity of dual-atom sites.

Arylamines are common structural motifs in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and materials precursors. While olefin aminofunctionalization chemistry can provide entry to arylamines, classical polar reactions typically afford Markovnikov products. Nitrogen-centered radical intermediates provide the opportunity to access anti-Markovnikov selectivity; however, anti-Markovnikov arylamination is unknown in large part due to the lack of arylamine radical precursors. Here, we introduce bidirectional electron transfer processes to generate arylamine radical intermediates from N-pyridinium arylamines: Single-electron oxidation provides arylamine radicals that engage in anti-Markovnikov olefin aminopyridylation; single-electron reduction unveils arylamine radicals that engage in anti-Markovnikov olefin aminofunctionalization. The development of bidirectional redox processes complements classical design principles for radical precursors, which typically function via a single redox manifold. Demonstration of both oxidative and reductive mechanisms to generate arylamine radicals from a common N-aminopyridinium precursor provides complementary methods to rapidly construct and diversify arylamine scaffolds from readily available radical precursors.

The eukaryotic translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and its analogue actiphenol (APN) feature a glutarimide moiety and a six-membered carbocyclic ring system. The biosynthesis of CHX and APN is not yet fully understood, particularly with respect to the mechanism of formation of the fully reduced cyclohexanone ring in CHX and the aromatic phenol ring in APN. In this work, a combination of gene inactivation, chemical synthesis, and in vitro biochemical experiments highlighted an ensemble of three tailoring redox enzymes as being responsible for the biosynthesis of the six-membered carbocyclic ring systems. Specifically, two redox enzymes (ChxJ and ChxI) alone can generate an active intermediate that undergoes a cascade of non-enzymatic transformations to create APN, while a reductive enzyme (ChxG) acts as a gatekeeper, directing the same intermediate down a different pathway toward CHX. Finally, the full nature of each biosynthetic pathway was established in detail, including the formation mechanisms of six-membered carbocyclic rings.
