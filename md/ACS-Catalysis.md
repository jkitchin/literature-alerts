The high conductivity and low decomposition potential of LiOH as the discharge product in Li–O2 batteries have garnered significant attention. However, challenges remain in developing LiOH-based Li–O2 batteries and promoting efficient generation/decomposition of LiOH. Here, we propose a strategy to build a binder-free cathode for Li–O2 batteries by embedding atomically dispersed Ru onto the surface of MnCo2O4 (RuSA-MnCo2O4) through defect engineering and adsorption–deposition methods, harnessing the synergistic benefits of spinel and a single atom in terms of catalytic activity and physical structure. The embedding of Ru leads to slight lattice distortion of MnCo2O4 and electron enrichment near Co, breaking the long-range ordered and symmetrical structure of spinel and transforming the symmetrical Mn/Co low-activity centers into asymmetrical Ru–O–Co high-activity centers. Compared to that of MnCo2O4, the d-band center of RuSA-MnCo2O4 is positioned further away from the Fermi level, resulting in an increased occupancy of antibonding orbitals. This leads to more moderate adsorption energies for LiO2* and LiOH*, as well as a reduction in the reaction barrier for LiOH formation, thereby optimizing the kinetics of the redox reactions. Thanks to the catalytic active center regulated by RuSA, the electrochemical performances were greatly improved, which also provides a clever approach for the development of catalysts for LiOH-based Li–O2 batteries.

In the recently burgeoning field of asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloaddition, a challenging hurdle lies in achieving a multilevel control of chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities in cross-coupling photoreactions, which often result in chaotic outcomes when partners show similar electronic and optical properties. Here, we introduce a biomimetic cage-pocket confined photocatalytic protocol that can effectively realize bimolecular recognition and manipulate excited triplet-state dynamics through stereochemical confinement. This approach allows for highly selective synthesis of heterocoupled [2 + 2] syn-HH (head-to-head) enantiomers from two photoactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, which are typically difficult to access via conventional strategies due to competitive pathways. We find that the cooperative heteromolecular binding dynamics plays a critical role in initial chemoselective and successive stereoselective photoreactions. Notably, the open pockets of the cage reactor display tolerable guest–host match but products–host mismatch for a wide scope of substrates, overcoming common limitations associated with enzyme-mimicking cage reactors such as guest specificity and product inhibition against catalytic generality and turnover.

The application of selective catalytic reduction with ammonia (NH3-SCR) technology urgently requires catalysts with good performance to control nitrogen oxide (NOx, x = 1, 2) emissions, and structural analysis of such catalysts is necessary and crucial to elucidate the performance of catalytically active sites. Thus, we prepared molybdenum (Mo)-doped CeO2 catalysts to achieve a substantial leap in catalytic performance. The results revealed that the emergence of Ce3+–O–Ce3+ structural units induced by Mo doping achieved the low-energy barrier activation of the NH3 molecule, which transformed the dominant reaction mechanism in the catalytic reaction and thus led to a much better SCR performance. Furthermore, we designed tungsten (W)-doped CeO2 catalysts with the same doping amount as Mo and found that the catalysts exhibited almost the same activity trend as the Mo-doped CeO2 catalysts, which further confirmed the pivotal role of the Ce3+–O–Ce3+ structural units. This study provides a basic theoretical foundation for the design of ceria-based SCR catalysts with efficient catalytic performance for NOx removal.

Homogeneous catalysts─organometallic complexes but also organocatalysts or nanoparticle catalysts─display attractive features that are of high academic and industrial interest. Various concepts have been established for their integrated recycling in the realization of industrial processes with metal complexes to achieve quasistationary operation. With the constant development of novel synthetic tools and improved catalyst structures, innovative methods for their effective recycling remain an important and thoroughly investigated research objective. However, recycling experiments of homogeneous catalysts on a laboratory scale need to be carried out using reliable and generalized methods to collect valuable data that allow for conclusive comparison of different approaches. In this Perspective, we first analyze and categorize the industrial applied techniques for recycling of organometallic catalysts and then present and evaluate performance indicators of recycling methods on the research stage. As a conclusion, a best practice for planning and conducting experimental studies is suggested to generate and present comparable results across different laboratories and disciplines.

Reduction of oxides of carbon (CO and CO2) to fixed forms of carbon is desirable to achieve sustainable and clean energy. Carbon monoxide (CO), an intermediate product in CO2 reduction, is challenging to reduce, which in turn jeopardizes the direct reduction of CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ to products like CH3OH and CH4. Iron porphyrins can efficiently reduce CO2 to CO by 2e–/2H+, but further reduction is halted by the rapid dissociation of CO from the reduced iron center. This work shows that CO can indeed be reduced upon inclusion of a pendent pyridine in the second coordination sphere of an iron porphyrin complex efficiently and selectively to CH4 using water or phenol as the proton source. In situ spectro-electrochemistry supported by theoretical calculations indicates that the pendent pyridine moiety imposes a hydrogen bonding interaction between the bound CO and water, which stabilizes two low-valent CO adducts, i.e., Fe(I)–CO and Fe(0)–CO, of iron porphyrins, allowing its complete reduction, via a Fe(II)–CHO species, to CH4. The ability to activate and reduce CO by ne–/nH+ via a second-sphere hydrogen bonding interaction in a mononuclear iron porphyrin opens newer pathways to valorize both CO and CO2 to valuable C1 products.

PtlD, a multifunctional mononuclear nonheme iron and α-ketoglutarate-dependent (NHFe/α-KG) dioxygenase involved in neopentalenoketolactone biosynthesis, catalyzes hydroxylation, desaturation, and olefin epoxidation reactions. Investigating desaturation reactions of nonactivated carbons mediated by NHFe/α-KG enzymes is intriguing, especially for understanding the fate of the substrate radicals formed after hydrogen atom abstraction by FeIV═O species. Here, we investigate the desaturation reaction mechanism of PtlD using two distinct substrates: neopentalenolactone D (1) features a lone pair-containing oxygen atom adjacent to the olefin-forming carbon atoms, whereas pentalenolactone D (7) harbors a carbonyl group at the corresponding position. For substrate 1, our isotope effect measurement and protein mutagenesis experiments suggest the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which is subsequently deprotonated by a base to generate the desaturation products. Residue K288 serves as the base, while Y113 likely stabilizes the carbocation via a π-cation interaction. For substrate 7, oxygen incorporation patterns indicated that a carbocation intermediate is also formed but is unstable, leading to hydroxylation due to H2O quenching. Notably, substrate 7's desaturation exhibits a temperature-dependent large kinetic isotope effect (KIE) and an inverse solvent isotope effect (SIE), suggesting that hydrogen tunneling contributes to the electron–proton transfer (EPT) process. These findings collectively reveal the cases of NHFe/α-KG enzymes, where distinct desaturation mechanisms switch with different substrates.

Dehydration of alcohols into alkenes is a key reaction for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass. However, the mechanism of these reactions is highly questionable, hindering the rational optimization of efficient catalysts. In the present work, the formation of linear butenes starting from isobutanol catalyzed by proton-exchanged zeolites is unraveled by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). Comparison with static calculations done for a gas phase reaction catalyzed by a proton and for the prototypical chabazite zeolite framework shows that AIMD estimations of the free energy barriers are significantly different from the static ones. Moreover, a common transition state (TS) is found for two competing reactions, namely, the isomerization of isobutanol into butan-2-ol (the dehydration of the latter yielding linear butenes) and the synchronous dehydration and isomerization of isobutanol into products related to linear butenes in a single step. The existence of a post-TS bifurcation prevents a traditional estimation of rates by transition state theory. To circumvent this problem, we quantify relative transmission coefficients using the Bennett–Chandler theory, which shows a clear tendency for decrease of relative frequency for isobutanol isomerization and increase of that for synchronous dehydration and isomerization when switching from 100 to 500 K. This work represents a step forward for the accurate determination of rates for key reactions in alcohol dehydration reactions.

FeN4 active sites have been studied as non-Pt group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The authors recently developed Fe(II) 1,14:7,8-ditethenotetrapyrido-[2,1,6-de:2′,1′6′-gh:2″,1″,6″-na][1,3,5,8,10,12] hexaazacyclotetradecine (Fe-14MR) as an FeN4 complex incorporating a 14-membered ring. This complex exhibited higher ORR activity and greater durability than Fe phthalocyanine, a conventional FeN4 complex having a 16-membered ring. In the present study, the ORR activity and durability of this Fe-14MR complex supported on C (Fe-14MR/C) were enhanced through modification of the active site structure by heating at 600 °C and removing protons on amine groups in the Fe-14MR. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Fe-14MR/C structure generated by heating resulted in oxygen species absorption energies close to optimal values for the ORR. The improved durability of the heat-treated Fe-14MR/C was attributed to reduced distortion of the FeN4 sites. The results suggest that designing Fe-14MR structures can be a promising approach to developing non-PGM catalysts.

We investigate an approach to tune the d-band center and enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt material without relying on foreign metals or the process of alloying/dealloying. It is known that Pt exhibits suboptimal ORR catalytic activity due to its strong binding to oxygen, therefore requiring a downshift in the d-band center by approximately 0.2 eV to weaken the Pt-O binding energy and boost ORR kinetics. We found that the d-band center can be tuned by inducing microstrain in the Pt electrodeposit, simply achieved by introducing polymer into the electrodeposition bath. Pt electrodes (Pt-P1 and Pt-PLA) prepared with the addition of poly-N-(6-aminohexyl)acrylamide (P1) or poly-l-arginine (PLA) exhibit improved ORR activity compared to Pt electrodeposited without polymer addition (Pt-alone) in both acidic and basic environments, with the order of activity being Pt-P1 > Pt-PLA > Pt-alone. Pt-P1 exhibits a positive shift of E1/2 by 90 mV vs Pt-alone in basic solution, comparable to other reported high-activity ORR catalysts. Scanning electron microscopy shows the presence of agglomerates with diameters between 5 and 20 μm and tip-splitting growth structure due to diffusion-limited aggregation on Pt-P1 and Pt-PLA. Characterization using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, combined with Rietveld refinement analysis reveal a trend of downshifted d-band center, increased microstrain, and slightly increased compressive strain as the ORR activity increased among the three catalysts. The presence of more defective sites on Pt-P1 and Pt-PLA is the cause of the increased microstrain, which further leads to the downshift of the Pt d-band center and enhancement of ORR activity.

Electrocatalysts play a critical role in energy technologies, but the development of active, efficient, and durable catalysts is impeded by the lack of methodologies to deconvolute the complex interplay between various aspects influencing the activity of the catalysts, e.g., the number of active sites, turnover frequency, and the reaction pathways. Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) is an emerging tool for the analysis of electroactive species and has been successfully applied to a variety of reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and hydrogen oxidation reaction. The harmonics generated from FTacV measurements neatly detect underlaying processes not visible by other, more commonly employed techniques for analysis of electrocatalysts, such as the rotating disc electrode and dc voltammetry. The harmonic components enable separating overlapping processes based on differences in kinetics or linearity of response. This paper presents a review of FTacV applied for the analysis of electrocatalysts. It highlights the importance of determining the electrochemically active site density (EASD) to decipher the intrinsic activity of a catalyst and discusses the use of FTacV in dynamic determination of the EASD over the course of a catalyst's working life, as well as the use of FTacV to understand intricate catalytic processes.

Catalysts with noble metals deposited as single atoms on metal oxide supports have recently been studied extensively due to their maximized metal utilization and potential for performing difficult chemical conversions owing to their unique electronic properties. Understanding of the reaction mechanisms on supported single-metal atoms is still limited but is highly important for designing more efficient catalysts. In this study, we report the complexity of the CO oxidation reaction mechanism on Pt single atoms supported on anatase TiO2 (PtSA/a-TiO2) by coupling density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis with kinetic measurements, in situ/operando infrared, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. Starting from the adsorbed PtSA occupying an O vacancy induced by reductive pretreatment, we show that CO oxidation follows a complex mechanism consisting of initiation steps to reorganize the active site and multibranch reactive cycles, with the PtSA/a-TiO2 catalyst not returning to its initial configuration. The initiation step consists of CO and O2 adsorption healing the O vacancy, followed by CO oxidation using gas-phase CO to form Pt(CO). The reactive cycle alternates O2 adsorption and dissociation to oxidize the catalyst to Pt(O)(O)(CO) and branching pathways of competing Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH)- or Eley–Rideal (ER)-type CO oxidation steps to reduce it again to Pt(CO). In situ/operando infrared experiments, including cryogenic CO adsorption and isotopic CO exchange, confirm the combined involvement of strongly adsorbed CO and gas-phase CO in an Eley–Rideal step along the reaction cycle. Microkinetic modeling shows that Pt single atoms are present in a mixture of Pt(CO), Pt(CO)(O2), Pt(O)(CO)(O2), and Pt(CO)(CO3) structures as the main intermediates during steady-state CO oxidation, all having the C–O vibrational stretch close to the experimentally observed value of 2115 cm–1. Microkinetic modeling also shows that the fractional orders of CO and O2 measured experimentally originate from multiple steps with a high degree of rate control and not from a simple competitive adsorption. The results demonstrate the complex reaction pathways that even CO oxidation on a simple single-atom system can follow, providing mechanistic insights for designing efficient Pt-based single-atom catalysts. We further show that microkinetic modeling results are sensitive to changes in energies of intermediate and transition states within errors of density functional theory, which can ultimately lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the reaction pathways and most abundant reaction intermediates if not accounted for by experiments.
