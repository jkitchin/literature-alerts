## Traces Used For Calibration Of Npb Lu With Smpi / Simgrid

These traces were used to calibrate the NAS NPB Benchmark LU with SMPI. The archives contain the traces for 12 cores, all run on 1 single node (that contained 12 cores). The extracted size should be around 7 GB for the MPI one and 600 MB for SMPI. The .org-file contains the analysis used to obtain the required input files for SimGrid. You can load them in org-mode and then execute via "C-c C-v b" the whole buffer. Make sure to extract the archives in /tmp/ or change the paths accordingly.
