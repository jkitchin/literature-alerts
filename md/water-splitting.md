Abstract Solar hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production has garnered increased research interest owing to its safety, cost‐effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and sustainability. The synthesis of H 2 O 2 relies mainly on renewable resources such as water, oxygen, and solar energy, resulting in minimal waste. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) stands out among various oxide semiconductors for selective H 2 O 2 production under visible light via direct two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and two‐electron water oxidation reaction (WOR) pathways. Significant advancements have been achieved using BiVO 4 ‐based materials in solar H 2 O 2 production over the last decade. This review explores advancements in BiVO 4 ‐based photocatalysts for H 2 O 2 production, focusing on photocatalytic powder suspension (PS) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems, representing the main approaches for heterogenous artificial photosynthesis. An overview of fundamental principles, performance assessment methodologies, photocatalyst and photoelectrode development, and optimization of reaction conditions is provided. While diverse strategies, such as heterojunction, doping, crystal facet engineering, cocatalyst loading, and surface passivation, have proven effective in enhancing H 2 O 2 generation, this review offers insights into their similar and distinct implementations within the PS and PEC systems. The challenges and future prospects in this field are also discussed to facilitate the rational design of high‐performing BiVO 4 ‐based photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for H 2 O 2 generation under visible light.

Abstract The NiFe‐oxy/hydroxides (NiFeO x H y ) have emerged as promising candidates for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but suffer from irreversible metal dissolution to pose a great challenge to long‐term stability. Here, a self‐supported electrode of NiFeO x H y /FeNiO x /SS‐A (substrate‐etched stainless steel, SS‐A; interlayer‐amorphous Fe 3 Ni 1 O x oxide; catalytic layer‐amorphous Ni 3 Fe 1 O x H y ) is fabricated and presents rare self‐healing property of surface cracks, as well excellent activity and stability. It is found that crack repair is driven by the redeposition of dissolved Fe and Ni ions from the amorphous interlayer involved in the OER process because no similar behavior is observed in Fe‐free and crystalline interlayer‐supported NiFeO x H y . Moreover, the repair performance is dependent on current density and electrolysis time, with 71% of surface cracks being repaired after 72 h operated on an industrial level of 500 mA cm −2 . It needs to be emphasized that the irreversible dissolution of Fe and Ni from the catalytic layer of NiFeO x H y still occurs but is effectively suppressed. It is demonstrated that the construction of an amorphous FeNiO x oxide interlayer in self‐supported electrodes plays an important role in improving the stability and is expected to open up an opportunity for the design and develop highly efficient and durable alkaline OER catalytic electrodes.

Abstract Rutile RuO 2 is recognized for its outstanding acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and notable cost advantage compared to iridium oxide for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, the unsatisfactory stability of RuO 2 hinders its practical application. Here, we report a lattice modulation strategy to enhance both the OER activity and stability of RuO 2 . Interestingly, the newly synthesized Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 ‐RuO 2 , with Mo doped first and then Nb, presents the greatest lattice spacing and possesses an overpotential of merely 205 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , which significantly outperforms Nb 0.05 Mo 0.15 ‐RuO 2 (239 mV), where Nb was doped first followed by Mo, as well as the initial RuO 2 (323 mV). Remarkably, Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 ‐RuO 2 requires only 1.76 V to achieve 1 A cm −2 and exhibits exceptional stability in PEMWE testing, with a voltage rise of only 58 mV at 200 mA cm −2 for more than 80 h.

Abstract Spin configuration and coordination environment changes have emerged as promising strategies to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. However, achieving the precise and gradual regulation of both spin states and coordination environment to elucidate the structure-activity relationship remains a key priority and is rarely reported. In this work, we successfully induce the gradual transition of spin states of Fe sites from low spin state to a medium spin state and ultimately to high spin state by meticulously adjusting coordination environment within NiFe-MOF, while the Ni sites still keep a low spin state. Experimental and theoretical calculations confirm the precise regulation of spin polarization and electrons migration from the Fe-t2g to the Fe-eg orbitals with a reduced coordination saturation, which optimizes the spin orbital exchange interactions between Fe and Ni ions and facilitates adsorption of reaction intermediates. The NiFe-MOF-D3 with unique NiO6-FeO4 geometric structure exhibits low overpotential of 328 mV@1 A cm-2 and 365 mV@1.5 A cm-2 in alkaline medium. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline electrolyzer also presents remarkable activity (1.77 V@500 mA cm-2) and lower cost ($ 0.94) than the target of U.S. Department of Energy ($ 2.00).

Abstract Developing stable and cost‐effective electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting is essential for advancing sustainable hydrogen production. In this work, CuBP microparticle clusters (MPCs) electrocatalyst is demonstrated on a Ni foam substrate, fabricated by using a one‐pot hydrothermal approach followed by post‐annealing treatment. The optimized CuBP electrode exhibits impressive activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), showing overpotentials of 49 and 220 mV at 50 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH, which are comparable to benchmark Pt/C and RuO 2 electrodes. The bifunctional CuBP achieves a cell voltage of 1.52 V at 50 mA cm −2 , outperforming the Pt/C||RuO 2 systems and also demonstrating excellent stability over 120‐h operations. At 2000 mA cm −2 , a voltage of 3.12 V is required in CuBP||CuBP configuration whereas the hybrid Pt/C||RuO 2 design exhibits a significantly lower cell voltage of 2.25 V at 2000 mA cm −2 . The superior catalytic behavior of the CuBP electrode can be attributed to the high active surface area due to the micro‐particle topology, the optimal balance of Cu, B, and P, and the enhanced conductivity achieved through vacuum annealing. Overall, the CuBP electrode is highly efficient and has significant potential to replace traditional RuO₂ electrodes.

ABSTRACT One of the most mature technologies for green hydrogen production is alkaline water electrolysis. However, this process is kinetically limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Improving the OER kinetics requires electrocatalysts, which can offer superior catalytic activity and stability in alkaline environments. Stainless steel (SS) has been reported as a cost‐effective and promising OER electrode due to its ability to form active Ni‐Fe oxyhydroxides during OER. However, it is limited by a high Fe‐to‐Ni ratio, leading to severe Fe‐leaching in alkaline environments. This affects not only the electrode activity and stability but can also be detrimental to the electrolyzer system. Therefore, we investigate the effect of different Ni‐coatings on both pure Ni‐ and SS‐supports on the OER activity, while monitoring the extent of Fe‐leaching during continuous operation. We show that thin layers of Ni enable enhanced OER activities compared to thicker ones. Especially, a less than 1 µm thick Ni layer on an SS‐support shows superior OER activity and stability with respect to the bare supports. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals traces of oxidized Fe species on the catalyst surface after OER, suggesting that Fe from the SS may be incorporated into the layer during operation, forming active Ni‐Fe oxyhydroxides with a very low Fe leaching rate. Utilizing inductively coupled plasma‐optical emission spectroscopy, we prove that thin Ni layers on SS decrease Fe leaching whereas the Fe from the uncoated SS‐support dissolves into the electrolyte during operation. Thus, OER active and stable electrodes can be obtained while maintaining a low Fe concentration in the electrolyte. This is particularly relevant for application in high‐performance electrolyzer systems.

Mixed-metal nickel-iron, NixFe materials draw attention as affordable earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here nickel and mixed-metal nickel-iron metal-organic framework (MOF) composites with the carbon materials ketjenblack (KB) or carbon nanotubes (CNT) were synthesized in situ in a one-pot solvothermal reaction. As a direct comparison to these in situ synthesized composites, the neat MOFs were postsynthetically mixed by grinding with KB or CNT, to generate physical mixture composites. The in situ and postsynthetic MOF/carbon samples were comparatively tested as (pre-)catalysts for the OER and most of them outperformed the RuO2 benchmark. Depending on the carbon material and metal ratio the in situ or postsynthethic composites performed better, showing that the method to generate the composite can influence the OER activity. The best material Ni5Fe-CNT was synthesized in situ and achieved an overpotential (η) of 301 mV (RuO2 η = 354 mV), a Tafel slope (b) of 58 mV/dec (RuO2 b = 91 mV/dec), a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 7 Ω (RuO2 Rct= 39 Ω) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95% (RuO2 FE = 91%). Structural changes in the materials could be seen through a stability test in the alkaline electrolyte and chronopotentiometry over 12 h showed that the derived electrocatalysts and RuO2 have a good stability.

Abstract Transition metal‐based tellurides (TMTs) with excellent electrical conductivity are expected to be ideal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. However, compared to transition metal sulfides and selenides, the reported applications of TMTs in overall water splitting are fewer. Herein, the NiTe/FeTe/Fe 3 O 4 /FF carnation flower‐like with a semi‐coherent interface is successfully constructed to enhance the electrochemical overall water splitting performance. Specifically, it achieves low overpotentials of 54 and 176 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. What's more, the electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of 1.5 V to sustain a current density of 10 mA cm −2 and maintains remarkable stability for an extensive duration of 450 h even at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 . Semi‐coherent interface engineering and vacancy engineering not only improve the OH⁻ adsorption capacity of catalysts but also promote the desorption of adsorbed hydrogen (H ads ). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that FeOOH and NiOOH formed by NiTe/FeTe/Fe 3 O 4 /FF during the OER are the genuine active sites. This study provides a promising approach for the electrochemical water splitting of TMTs by combining semi‐coherent interface engineering and vacancy engineering.

Abstract This study reports an effective strategy for designing 3D electrocatalyst via the deposition of ZIF67‐derived Co–CN shell layer over CuO nanoarrays to form a CuO@Co–CN hybrid, followed by incorporation with p ‐block Sb single atoms (CuO@Co–CN/Sb) to obtain highly activated catalytic behaviors. Inheriting both the excellent intrinsic catalytic activity of the components and their synergy, the CuO@Co–CN/Sb material serves as a high‐efficiency multifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting and zinc (Zn)–air batteries. The material yields a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at a low overpotential of 72 and 250 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Furthermore, an electrolyzer based on CuO@Co–CN/Sb shows remarkable performance with a derived current density of 0.5 A cm −2 at low cell voltage of 2.67 V and good stability for 50 h continuous operation at a high current density of 0.5 A cm −2 . Simultaneously, Zn–air battery using the CuO@Co–CN/Sb material as air cathode yields a high open circuit voltage of 1.455 V and a discharge power density of 131.07 mW cm −2 .

Abstract Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with the alternative glycerol electro‐oxidation reaction (GER) provides a promising strategy to enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production via water electrolysis while co‐generating high‐value chemicals. However, obtaining low‐cost and efficient GER electrocatalysts remains a big challenge. Herein, a self‐supported N‐doped Co 2 NiO 4 nanoflakes (N‐Co 2 NiO 4 NF) is proposed for efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of glycerol to formate. The synergistic effect induced by the interaction of the layered Co 2 NiO 4 nanostructures on the 3D‐printed Nickel‐Yttria‐stabilized zirconia (Ni‐YSZ) substrate and the amorphous nitrogen‐doping promotes the anodic GER. The N‐Co 2 NiO 4 NF exhibits low potentials of 1.07 and 1.18 V ( vs . RHE) for GER to drive 10 and 50 mA cm −2 , respectively. The constituted two‐electrode electrolyzer (N‐Co 2 NiO 4 NF//NiS‐Co‐NiP) displays excellent activity that only requires ultralow cell voltages of 1.24 and 1.55 V to afford 10 and 200 mA cm −2 , respectively, with a high FE (97%) for formate production and an excellent durability (120 h). This study provides a versatile approach for manufacturing high‐performance Ni‐based electrocatalyst for GER, paving the way for the energy‐saving and environmentally‐friendly co‐production of value‐added chemicals and hydrogen.

Abstract Noble metal‐based electrocatalysts are impractical for large‐scale manufacture due to their high cost, limited availability, and poor long‐term stability in performing several functions. Hence, an alternative is the need of the hour that emphasizes blending metals and ceramic property materials with compelling electroconductivity. In this research, we synthesized two bare materials, Nb 2 AlC MAX (Nb‐MX) phase and graphitic carbon‐nitride (GCN) sheets using the calcination method which is then converted into a composite (Nb‐MX/GCN) material through wet impregnation technique. The electrochemical investigations were conducted to assess the catalytic efficacy of the composite material. The synthesized Nb‐MX/GCN electrocatalyst exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic efficiency for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline environment. The catalyst exhibits a significantly low overpotential of just 66 mV and 450 mV for the HER and OER performance, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in a 1.0 M KOH solution. In addition, the catalytic activity exhibited no change over 24 h which indicated the excellent stability of the material. This performance surpassed the previously reported electrocatalysts.

The development of highly efficient, stable, and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of water splitting, but it still remains a huge challenge. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) self-supported Cr-doped Ni3N (Cr–Ni3N) nanosheet arrays were synthesized successfully on the carbon cloth by the hydrothermal method and subsequent nitridation process. Cr–Ni3N displays a superior alkaline OER performance with a low overpotential of 290 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm–2, a small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec–1, and robust electrochemical stability, which is much better than those of bare Ni3N and commercial RuO2. The calculation of density functional theory reveals that electron-rich Cr atoms transfer electrons to electron-deficient Ni and N atoms, effectively adjust the surface electron configuration of the Cr–Ni3N catalyst, and optimize the H2O adsorption in the 1 M KOH solution during the OER process. Additionally, the partially oxidized Cr6+ during the OER can optimize the electronic structure and enhance the stability of NiOOH active sites by the strong electron withdrawing ability. This work can provide a pathway to rationally design efficient transition metal nitride-based OER electrocatalysts.

Although hydrogen generation by water electrolysis is the cheapest of all other available sources, water splitting still occurs with sluggish kinetics. It is a challenging barrier for H2 production on a large scale. Moreover, research is still underway to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and design the catalysts with improved OER performance. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and OER performance of iron-doped copper oxide (CuO) as low-cost catalysts for water oxidation. The OER occurs at about 1.49 V versus the RHE with a Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential of 338 mV at 10 mA/cm2 is among the lowest compared with other copper-based materials. The catalyst can deliver a stable current density of >10 mA/cm2 for more than 10 hours. Additionally, wastewater treatment, particularly synthetic dye wastewater, is vital for preventing water scarcity and adverse effects on human health and ecotoxicology. The as-synthesized catalysts are also utilized for Fenton-like photo-degradation under low-power visible household LED lights toward the most commonly industrially used simulated Methylene blue dye wastewater. Almost complete degradation of the MB dye has been achieved within 50 minutes of visible light irradiation with a first-order rate constant of 0.0973/min. This dual functionality feature can open new pathways as a non-noble, highly efficient, and robust catalyst for OER and wastewater treatments.

Oxygen redox chemistries at high voltage have materialized as a revolutionary paradigm for cathodes with high-energy density; however, they are plagued by the challenges of labile oxygen loss and rapid degradations upon cycling, even after concerted endeavors from the research community. Here we propose a multi-concentration stratagem propelled by entropy reinforcement to enhance the electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation states for impeding undesired oxygen mobility and ensuring controlled oxygen activity, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. The increased disorder strengthens the reversible electrochemistry of lattice oxygen redox, leading to effectively suppressed P-O structural evolution and highly stable localized TMO6 octahedral environments, as demonstrated by soft/hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, we reveal that a high-entropy state induced by cationic disordering has capacity to perturb cationic redox boundaries, significantly restraining the formation of detrimental P3' phases. As a consequence, the high-voltage cycling stability has been greatly enhanced, up to 4.4 V versus Na+/Na, with an impressive 90.1% capacity retention at 1C over 100 cycles and 76.1% capacity retention at 2C over 300 cycles. The resilient oxygen redox, enabled through the control of ESD, broadens the horizons for entropy engineering and lays the foundation for advancements in high-energy, long-cycling, safe batteries.

Abstract A promising next‐generation high‐energy cathode material, LiNiO 2 (LNO) has failed to realize commercialization due to severe capacity degradation during cycling. The dual mechanisms of surface oxygen evolution due to anion redox and anisotropic volume change upon delithiation synergistically pulverize and degrade the material. Detailed Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling and analysis of the anisotropic structural changes associated with crack formation in LiNiO 2 (LNO) reveals the link of mechanical behavior to charge transfer and oxygen redox activity upon deep charge cycling (>4.2 V vs Li/Li + ). In the two‐phase region and H2–H3 transition from 66% to 100% delithiation, oxygen of [NiO 6 ] octahedra is discovered to undergo redox in growing the Li‐deficient regions, causing c‐lattice mechanical weakening and collapse as the Li‐slab becomes depleted. Li‐site dopants are investigated to locally compensate against anion redox, resulting in enhanced coulombic repulsion and supporting the interslab layer thickness even at 100% depth of charge. Ionic size and oxidation state of M in Li x‐y M y NiO 2 are found to fundamentally impact stabilization capability, moderating the anisotropic strain and volume expansion asynchronously. Optimization of mixed doping composition may then enable “zero strain” high‐Ni Li(Ni,Co,Mn)O 2 (NCM) or LNO.

The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver-based electrocatalysts (Ag-x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x = 0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver-based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag-10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and 456 mV at 100 mA cm-2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag-10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (-111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag-O-O-Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide-based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.

Metal synergy can enhance the catalytic performance, and a prefabricated solid precursor can guide the ordered embedding, of secondary metal source ions for the rapid synthesis of bimetallic organic frameworks (MM’-MOFs) with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. In this paper, Co-MOF-1D containing well-defined binding sites was synthesized by mechanical ball milling, which was used as a template for the induced introduction of Fe ions to successfully assemble the ordered bimetallic Co1Fe1-MOF-74@2 (where @2 denotes template-directed synthesis of MOF-74). Its electrocatalytic performance is superior to that of the conventional one-step-synthesized Co1Fe1-MOF-74@1 (where @1 denotes one-step synthesis of MOF-74), and the ratio of the two metal sources, Co and Fe, is close to 1:1. Meanwhile, the iron valence states (FeII and FeIII) in Co1Fe1-MOF-74@2 were further regulated to obtain the electrocatalytic materials Co1Fe1(II)-MOF-74@2 and Co1Fe1(III)-MOF-74@2. The electrochemical performance test results confirm that Co1Fe1(II)-MOF-74@2 regulated by valence state has a better catalytic performance than Co1Fe1(III)-MOF-74@2 in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. This phenomenon is related to the gradual increase in the valence state of Fe ions in Co1Fe1(II)-MOF-74@2, which promotes the continuous improvement in the performance of the MOF before reaching the optimal steady state and makes the OER performance reach the optimum when the FeII/FeIII mixed-valence state reaches a certain proportion. This provides a new idea for the directed synthesis and optimization of highly efficient catalysts.

Abstract Dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) possess tunable electronic structures and efficient atom utilization, making them highly promising for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER). However, achieving high catalytic activity and stability for both ORR and OER in DACs remains a challenge. Herein, a flexible membrane of porous carbon fiber anchored with atomically scattered CoN 4 /FeN 4 dual sites and adjacent Co 2 Fe 2 /Fe 5 nanoclusters (Co, Fe‐DACs/NCs@PCF) is synthesized. The local geometry and electronic structure of the CoN 4 /FeN 4 sites, which act as reaction centers for ORR/OER, are finely regulated by the neighboring Co 2 Fe 2 /Fe 5 nanoclusters. This unique structure imparts Co, Fe‐DACs/NCs@PCF with exceptional activity and durability toward ORR/OER, outperforming the performance of single‐atom catalysts containing only CoN 4 or FeN 4 sites, as well as commercial Pt/C and RuO 2 catalysts. Zinc–air battery employing a Co, Fe‐DACs/NCs@PCF cathode exhibits outstanding stability, maintaining cyclability for over 1500 h, outperforming a Pt/C + RuO 2 air cathode. Theoretical calculations highlight distinct synergies between Fe 5 (Co 2 Fe 2 ) clusters and FeN 4 (CoN 4 ) sites, which optimize the coupling strength of Fe(Co)─OH at the potential‐determining steps and thus improve ORR (OER) catalytic kinetics. This study lays a theoretical and practical foundation for rational design of heterostructure catalysts featuring coexisting DACs and nanoclusters within porous carbon fibers.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting represents a highly promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion and storage, paving the way for a future hydrogen-based society. This approach necessitates the development of durable and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the OER. In this study, we report the as-synthesized NiFe-based high-entropy compound grown on nickel foam via direct electrochemical deposition. Remarkably, electrodeposition onto 1×1 cm2 nickel foam was optimized by strategically varying critical parameters. Subsequently, the fabricated electrodes underwent evaluation for comprehensive water splitting within the identical flow cell under alkaline conditions. The best-performing sample, NiFe-2:1, required relatively low overpotentials of 232 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the OER. The NiFe-2:1 hydroxides exhibit high entropy, which optimizes the flat-band potential (Efb) and carrier concentration (NA) in high-entropy NiFe-based electrocatalysts. This enhancement facilitates sensitive electron transfer, thereby reducing the kinetic barrier for the OER. Furthermore, this review thoroughly discusses potential degradation mechanisms of active sites and outlines corresponding mitigation strategies. It also offers insights into the discrepancies between research and the design of non-precious metal-based catalysts for the OER, as well as their implementation in practical devices.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) stands as a pivotal electrochemical process, playing a crucial role in various cutting-edge renewable energy technologies such as water-splitting and metal-air batteries. However, its inherent sluggish kinetics necessitate a substantial overpotential to drive the OER, which significantly constrains the widespread application of these devices. Consequently, a range of efficient, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts, including carbon-based materials, metals, and metallic compounds, have been engineered to reduce the OER overpotential and enhance energy efficiency. In this section, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the recent intriguing advancements in metallic compounds for the OER, with a deep exploration of the catalytic mechanisms and the underlying structure–performance relationships. Specifically, we systematically delve into metal oxides, hydroxides, and their supported single-atom/nanoparticle materials, showcasing their superiority in driving the OER. Finally, we offer some new insights into the remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of metallic compounds.

Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their high surface area, tunable pore structures, and abundant active sites. Ligand engineering is an important strategy to optimize their performance. Here, we report the synthesis of NiFe‐MOFs based on three different ligands: 1,4‐terephthalic acid (BDC), 2,4‐thiophene dicarboxylic acid (TDC), and 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDC), to investigate the effects of heteroatom‐based aromatic rings on OER performance. It is revealed that by incorporating electronegative sulfur and oxygen atoms into the ligands, the electron density at the metal sites is reduced, leading to enhanced metal‐oxygen covalency and improved charge transfer kinetics. The NiFe‐FDC/NF catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA·cm‐2 and stable performance over 1300 hours at 1 A·cm‐2. In situ infrared spectroscopy reveal minimal structural reconstruction in NiFe‐FDC/NF, contributing to its superior stability. The NiFe‐FDC/NF were then subjected to 3600 hours of OER operation and it’s metal elution was monitored. These findings offer a novel approach to ligand design for high‐performance MOF‐based OER catalysts, highlighting the potential of furan‐based ligands for MOF ligand engineering.

Iridium oxides are the leading oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, improving iridium utilization is crucial due to its high cost and scarcity. Crystalline rutile-type iridium dioxide (IrO2) offers superior stability in acidic OER conditions compared to amorphous iridium oxide (IrOx), but the high synthesis temperatures required for crystalline phase formation reduce OER activity by decreasing active surface area. Herein, we present a novel perchlorate fusion–hydrothermal (PFHT) synthesis method to produce nano-crystalline rutile-type IrO2 nanoparticles with exceptional OER performance. This low-temperature approach involves calcination 300 °C in the presence of a strong oxidizing agent, sodium perchlorate, followed by hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C, yielding ~2 nm IrO2 nanoparticles. The catalyst achieved a high mass-specific OER activity of 95 A gIr–1 at 1.525 VRHE in ex situ glass-cell testing. Notably, the PFHT-synthesized IrO2 demonstrated remarkable stability under harsh accelerated stress test conditions, outperforming commercial catalysts. The exceptional activity of the catalyst was confirmed with in situ PEMWE single-cell evaluations. This demonstrates that the PFHT synthesis method leverages the superior intrinsic properties of nano-crystalline IrO2, effectively overcoming the typical trade-offs between OER activity and catalyst stability, making it a promising approach for advancing PEMWE technologies.

Abstract It is of great significance for the development of hydrogen energy technology by exploring the new‐type and high‐efficiency electrocatalysts (such as single atom catalysts (SACs)) for water splitting. In this paper, by combining interface engineering and doping engineering, a unique single atom iron (Fe)‐doped carbon‐coated nickel sulfide (Ni 3 S 2 ) quantum wires (Ni 3 S 2 @Fe‐SACs) is prepared as a high‐performance bi‐functional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Theoretical calculation and experimental results show that the addition of atomic Fe species can effectively adjust the electronic structure of sulfide, the interfacial electron transfer modulates the d‐band center position, optimizing the transient state of the catalytic process and adsorption energy of hydrogen/oxygen intermediates, and greatly accelerates the kinetics of HER and OER. The results show that the Ni 3 S 2 @Fe‐SACs core‐shell quantum wires array exhibit overpotentials of 46 and 219 mV for HER and OER at 10 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH, respectively. In addition, the two‐electrode electrolyzer assembled by the Ni 3 S 2 @Fe‐SACs requires a voltage as low as 1.465 V to achieve alkaline overall water splitting of 10 mA cm −2 .

Developing highly efficient, cost‐effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large‐scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal‐air batteries. Herein, a new ternary‐atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2‐N6 and Ni‐N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen‐doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as‐synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in an alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2‐N6 or Ni‐N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2‐N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d‐band centers by the Ni‐N4 sites. This ternary‐atom catalyst may be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt‐ and Ru‐based catalysts to drive both ORR and OER in rechargeable zinc‐air batteries and other related applications.

Metal phosphate-type compounds have been utilized in diverse applications, and their distinctive chemical properties have recently opened avenues for their use as catalysts. Metal phosphates have previously demonstrated significant electrocatalytic activity for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical water splitting. However, the critical factors influencing OER electrocatalysis on Ni-based phosphates have been insufficiently explored. We herein demonstrate nickel (Ni)-based phosphates-monoclinic Ni

To alleviate the increasingly serious energy issues, it is essential to develop highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we employed density functional theory to investigate a broad spectrum of transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ag, W, Ir, and Pt) atoms supported on N-terminated diamond (100) surface (TM@ND) as single-atom catalysts for their OER and ORR performances. TM atoms (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, and Ir) show large binding energy with substrate and thermal stability, which is advantageous for electrocatalytic reactions. Especially, Ir@ND demonstrates high efficacy as an OER electrocatalyst, and Mn@ND is identified as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst, exhibiting the theoretical overpotentials smaller than 1 V. Consequently, it suggests that diamond-based catalysts could serve as promising candidates for energy conversion and storage applications.

Abstract Efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction play an important role in realizing hydrogen economy. In this study, the multi‐heterogeneous interfacial catalyst, Ni 2 P@FeP@Co 2 P (denoted as NFC), with an asymmetric built‐in electric field is successfully designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the double charge balance effect, NFC exhibits superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity. Importantly, the NFC‐assembled anion‐exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer exhibits enhanced performance and remarkable stability at industrial current densities and high temperatures, reaching a current density of 1000 mA cm −2 at the small voltage of 1.95 V. The results of the dynamic X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests indicate that the self‐reconfiguration of the NFC during OER provides additional active sites for the reaction. The density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the asymmetric built‐in electric field (BIEF) induces an adaptive distribution of charge, which optimizes the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen/oxygen intermediates during the reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic kinetics of the overall water splitting process. This work presents novel strategies for the design of highly active catalysts in the field of energy conversion.

Optimizing the composition and structure of nanocatalysts is an efficient approach to achieving the top electrocatalytic performance. However, the construction of hollow nanocomposites composed of metal phosphides and highly conductive carbon to promote the electrocatalytic performance of metal phosphide-based catalysts is rarely reported. Herein, a CoFeP/C nanobox nanocomposite consisting of Co-Fe mixed-metal phosphides and N-doped carbon was successfully fabricated through an ion-exchange phosphidation strategy derived from ZIF-67 nanocubes. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between multiple components and the unique hollow structure, CoFeP/C nanoboxes can catalyze the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high activity and stability. Furthermore, in the construction of an alkaline water electrolyzer using CoFeP/C nanoboxes as both OER and HER catalysts, they were capable of efficiently splitting water with a current density of 10 mA cm

Abstract Achieving large‐scale coupling of organic electrooxidation and the hydrogen evolution reaction, while understanding the competition between organic electrooxidation and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a significant challenge. In this study, using Ni 3 N‐MoN/NF, an efficient heterojunction electrocatalyst as both anode and cathode in a 50 cm 2 continuous flow reactor, we achieved a total current of ~20 A at 2.6 V. This resulted in the highest single‐pass 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural conversion efficiency (0.049 mmol cm −2 min −1 ) and gram‐level production of 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid. Theoretical studies revealed that MoN accelerated *OH formation and increased its deprotonation energy barrier, leading to *OH accumulation, effectively promoting organic electrooxidation and inhibiting OER. We anticipate that our foundation in understanding the reaction mechanism and catalyst design strategy can be extended to a wider range of anodic oxidation reactions.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an indispensable anode reaction for sustainable hydrogen production from water electrolysis, yet overreliance on metal-based catalysts featured with vibrant d-electrons. It still has notable gap between metal-free and metal-based electrocatalysts, due to lacking accurate and efficient p-band regulation methods on non-metal atoms. Herein, a molecular modularization strategy is proposed for fine-tuning the p-orbital states of series metal-free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for realizing OER performance beyond benchmark precious metal catalysts. Optimized combination of benzodioxazole/benzodiimide-based building blocks achieves an impressive applied potential of 1.670 ± 0.004 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 1.735 ± 0.006 V versus RHE to deliver enhanced current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A cm

Photosystem II (PSII) splits water in oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth. The structure and function of the C 4 S 4 M 2 -type PSII-LHCII (light-harvesting complex II) megacomplexes from the wild-type and PsbR-deletion mutant plants are studied through electron microscopy (EM), structural mass spectrometry, and ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy [time-resolved fluorescence (TRF)]. The cryo-EM structure of a type I C 4 S 4 M 2 megacomplex demonstrates that the three domains of PsbR bind to the stromal side of D1, D2, and CP43; associate with the single transmembrane helix of the redox active Cyt b 559 ; and stabilize the luminal extrinsic PsbP, respectively. This megacomplex, with PsbR and PsbY centered around the narrow interface between two dimeric PSII cores, provides the supramolecular structural basis that regulates the plastoquinone occupancy in Q B site, excitation energy transfer, and oxygen evolution. PSII-LHCII megacomplexes (types I and II) and LHC aggregation levels in Arabidopsis psbR mutant were also interrogated and compared to wild-type plants through EM and picosecond TRF.

Side reactions of water decomposition and capacitive reactions occur concomitantly in aqueous supercapacitors. To improve the energy density, integrated design modifications to address the impact of these two aspects on the reaction kinetics are theoretically effective. Herein, a two-step modification strategy for introducing binary functional species is designed to regulate the chemical environment and electronic structure of the metal active sites and further optimize the electrochemical kinetics comprehensively. For promoting the capacitive reactions, Ag nanoparticles were loaded to decrease the corresponding energy barriers. For suppressing the oxygen evolution side reaction, preintercalation of K+ ions was realized to increase the corresponding energy barriers. The assembled supercapacitor device shows an ultrahigh energy density of 143.2 Wh kg–1. Uniquely, in situ techniques, DFT calculations, and overpotential tests are combined to verify the suppression mechanism. This work provides valuable guidance for coordinating designs and studies on the electrochemical kinetics of transition-metal-based electrode materials.

Abstract This study presents the correlation between electrolyte pH, surface morphology, chemical speciation and electro‐catalytic oxygen evolution activity of additive‐free electrodeposited NiFe catalysts for application in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis. Spherical morphologies were identified at pH 0, shifting towards honey‐combed structures at pH 4 with increasing surface area, especially at pH 3. Further, the electrolyte pH was found to influence the NiFe composition and electro‐catalytic activity. Enhanced OER activity was noted at pH 2 with overpotentials of 214 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and 267 mV at 100 mA cm −2 . The results reveal that the electrolyte pH is a parameter not only influencing the morphology but also tailoring the surface area, Fe oxide and Fe hydroxide composition and consequently the catalytic activity. Further, the outcomes highlight the electrolyte pH as a key process parameter that should be adjusted according to the application, and may substitute the addition of electrolyte‐additives, proposing a simpler method for improving catalyst electrodeposition.

Degradation tests represent a significant bottleneck in electrochemical technology development, occasionally requiring tens of thousands of hours. Thus, reliable degradation forecasting in a short time frame is a game-changer in accelerating the establishment of future electrochemical devices. Herein, we show a multidimensional kinetic model for electrocatalyst degradation by quantifying the relationship among potential, current, and time, applicable under various conditions. Aiming to predict reliable degradation behaviors in shorter experimental timeframes and inspired by modern weather forecasting methods, we integrated Bayesian data assimilation with our model to expedite multidimensional parameter optimization. Consequently, we achieved accurate and robust forecasting of electrocatalyst lifetime by employing oxygen evolution reaction as a representative system: it takes just 300 h to obtain the final lifetime of close to 1000 h even with environmental noise. This data-driven approach can accelerate our understanding of the microscopic electrochemical mechanisms and simultaneously directly bridge this understanding to develop next-generation energy technologies.

Hydrogen is renewable, efficient energy carrier that can contribute to solve the climate change problem when paired with sustainable electricity and water electrolysis. While PEM electrolysis is outstanding in producing high purity of hydrogen, the AWE electrolysis has been Versatile in meeting several industrial purposes. AEM technology is considered as more cost effective than the existing technologies which uses highly costly metal catalysts such as Pt, Au, Ru, etc. However, water electrolysis which is a sustainable method for hydrogen production supplies only 4% of the global hydrogen due to high costs. Unfortunately, the use of precious metals constrains the prospect of scale-up; nevertheless, automation-based naked-metal electrocatalysts can be advanced as cost-effective yet conductive and electrocatalytically active solutions. But much more work has to be done to improve their characteristics and stability. In the context of this paper, the major developments and problems in water electrolysis are discussed based on the outlook for the effective and inexpensive catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. To this end, it seeks to overcome these barriers in order to provide direction to future studies and facilitate the development of cost-effective water electrolyzers for sustainable hydrogen generation.

Abstract The electrocatalytic oxidation of solketal (SOR) as the anodic reaction can be used to enhance hydrogen production efficiency due to its lower overpotential compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Additionally, solketal oxidation yields besides formate also high‐value C 3 products, providing an advantage over the typical alternative reaction for OER, glycerol oxidation. The multi‐metal CoNiFeCu (1:1:1:0.5) catalyst is employed as electrocatalyst for SOR and different activation procedures are explored. The pre‐conditioning of the catalyst in the presence of solketal supports a current density of 10 mA cm −2 to be recorded at only 1.405 ± 1 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) during SOR, while promoting glyceric acid synthesis with 40% faradaic efficiency. Operando attenuated total reflection Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR‐FTIR) confirms that the activation of the catalyst contributes to an increased formation of products. However, most importantly, through utilizing the single‐particle‐on‐the‐nanoelectrode with identical‐location transmission electron microscope (IL‐TEM), it is unveiled that solketal suppresses Cu leaching and oxyhydroxide formation. Moreover, the structural transformations are correlated with the increased activity toward SOR.

ABSTRACT Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are ionic layered compounds characterized by anion‐containing intermediate regions within positively charged brucite‐like layers. LDHs have shown high electrochemical activity in energy conversion systems such as batteries and fuel cells. In this study, we developed a hierarchically porous nanostructure derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework‐67, which was subsequently transformed into an LDH structure with varying Ni concentrations. We precisely controlled the Ni‐to‐Co ratio within the LDH structure and investigated how different mole fractions of Co and Ni influence catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR). LDH structures with low Ni content (up to 40%) demonstrated high activity and selectivity for O 2 due to their structural instability and the predominant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) originating from ZIF‐67. In contrast, LDHs with high Ni content (over 60%) supressed OER and exhibited enhanced activity for UOR. The resulting hollow structure with an expanded electrochemically active surface in LDHs with high Ni content could improve mass transport and diffusion at the electrode interface, leading to better reaction kinetics and higher current densities. These findings provide a foundational design guideline for metal–organic framework‐derived nanostructure in UOR. image

In order to study the dynamic evolution of the “three zones” of spontaneous combustion and the distribution characteristics of oxygen concentration under different advancing distances in the compound goaf of shallow coal seam, through the field measurement of oxygen concentration in the goaf and the analysis of the development law and air leakage mechanism of the overlying rock fractures in the goaf, the calculation model of the compound goaf of shallow coal seam was established by using fluent simulation software. The depth, width, and dynamic evolution of the oxidation zone and oxygen concentration were obtained as the advancing distance increased in the lower and upper goaf, respectively. The results indicate that: in the secondary mining stage, with the increase of the advance distance, the oxidation zones on both sides of the overlying goaf and the lower goaf gradually extend backward, and finally form a “high on both sides, low in the middle” oxygen concentration distribution pattern within 100 m to 500 m of the goaf. At the same position, the width of the oxidation zone in the overlying goaf is less than that in the lower goaf, and the risk of spontaneous combustion is less than that in the lower goaf. After the advancing distance is greater than 100 m, the width of the oxidation zone at the air inlet side of the overlying goaf decreases with the increasing of the advancing distance, and the width of the oxidation zone at the air return side increases, and the width of the oxidation zone at both sides finally tends to be the same, The width of oxidation zone on both sides of the lower goaf increases first and then decreases with the increase of distance. The research results indicate that the evolution law of “three zones” of spontaneous combustion in the composite goaf during the mining process of shallow buried coal seams, and provide reference for preventing and controlling the spontaneous combustion caused by air leakage in the composite goaf in shallow buried depth.

Temperature and oxygen levels drive the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and physiological traits in marine invertebrates, including crustaceans. Environmental conditions are also expected to prompt the adaptive evolution of mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCGs), which are vital for energy production via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. We formally tested for adaptive evolution in mitochondrial protein-coding genes in representatives of the decapod infraorder Achelata, including two spiny lobsters, Panulirus echinatus and Panulirus interruptus , for which we sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes (15,644 and 15,659 bp long, respectively). A phylomitogenomic analysis based on all 13 mitochondrial PCGs for 24 species belonging to the infraorder Achelata, plus an outgroup representing the infraorders Caridea and Nephropidae, supported the monophyly of the genus Panulirus , the families Palinuridae and Scyllaridae, and the infraorder Achelata. Over the strong negative selection background observed for mitochondrial PCGs in the Achelata, signatures of positive selective pressure were detected within PCGs in equatorial Panulirus spp. and deepwater Scyllaridae. In Panulirus spp. inhabiting equatorial latitudes with consistently high temperatures, the Datamonkey analysis RELAX suggested intensified purifying selection strength in 9 of the 13 PCGs and relaxation in purifying selection strength in atp6, while aBSREL, BUSTED, and MEME recovered signatures of positive selection on PCGs within Complex I, III, and IV PCGs. Likewise, in Scyllaridae species inhabiting depths with low oxygen levels, RELAX indicated relaxed selection strength in 6 of the 13 PCGs, while aBSREL, BUSTED, and MEME recovered signatures of positive selection on PCGs within Complexes I, III, IV, and V. Adaptive evolution likely retains mutations that improve protein stability at sustained temperatures and enhance mitochondrial capacity for energy metabolism in low oxygen conditions. These mutations likely optimize the ability of Complex I to pump protons into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, improve electron transfer and proton translocation in Complex III, boost the efficiency with which Complex IV transfers electrons to oxygen to form water, and refine the ability of Complex V to produce energy via oxidative phosphorylation. The newly assembled mitochondrial genomes of P. echinatus and P. interruptus represent new genomic resources to aid the conservation and management of lobsters targeted by major fisheries through applications such as bioprospecting using eDNA sampling and species identification via DNA barcoding. This study also contributes to our understanding of how environmental conditions drive adaptive evolution in spiny and slipper lobster mitochondrial PCGs and supports the notion that mitochondrial protein-coding genes can and do experience adaptive evolution to optimize mitochondrial function in a wide variety of organisms. Further research is needed to clarify which and how environmental conditions influence the adaptive evolution of mitochondrial PCGs in other crustacean lineages and beyond.

Abstract The mechanisms underpinning the evolution of ectotherm body size across temperature and latitude remain an enduring mystery. Oxygen limitation in warmer aquatic environments is often invoked to explain steeper temperature–size relationships of aquatic species across latitude, but the role of aquatic environments on body size evolution of aquatic species that respire primarily in air is unclear. We tested the generality of intraspecific temperature–size responses in Testudines, assessing whether turtles generally follow Bergmann’s Rule, and whether aquatic versus terrestrial turtles exhibit different temperature–size responses. Using a global dataset of turtle body sizes, we found that turtles generally show decreasing body size with increasing temperature. However, we also found that aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial turtles respond similarly to temperature. Our study affirms the possibility that temperature–size relationships are driven partly by oxygen limitation in other ectotherms, but casts doubt on hypotheses related to oxygen limitation for groups that respire primarily in air. We formalize and explore a hypothesis that temperature–size responses in turtles are a result of heat balance, arguing small size in warm environments reduces overheating risk, and large size in cool environments minimizes heat loss. Ultimately, we provide new insight and direction in the study of ecogeographic clines.

Anionic redox has emerged as a transformative paradigm for high-energy layered transition-metal (TM) oxide cathodes, but it is usually accompanied by the formation of anionic redox-mediated oxygen vacancies (OVs) due to irreversible oxygen release. Additionally, external factor-induced OVs (defined as intrinsic OVs) also play a pivotal role in the physicochemical properties of layered TM oxides. However, an in-depth understanding of the interplay between intrinsic and anionic redox-mediated OVs and the corresponding regulation mechanism of the dynamic evolution of OVs is still missing. Herein, we disclose the strong interrelationship between these OVs and demonstrate that the presence of intrinsic OVs in the TMO

Abstract. Understanding the composition and evolution of atmospheric organic vapors is crucial for exploring their impact on air quality. However, the molecular and seasonal characteristics of organic vapors in urban areas, with complex anthropogenic emissions and high variability, remain inadequately understood. In this study, we conducted measurements in urban Beijing during 2021–2022, covering four seasons, using improved proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (Vocus-PTR-MS). During the measurement period, a total of 895 peaks were observed, and 512 of them can be assigned to formulas. The contribution of CxHyOz species is most significant, composing up to 54 % of the number and 74 % of the mixing ratio of total organics. With enhanced sensitivity and mass resolution, various species with multiple oxygens (≥ 3) or at a level of sub-parts per trillion (ppt) were observed, with 44 % of the number measured at sub-ppt level and 38 % of the number containing three–eight oxygen atoms. Organic vapors with multiple oxygens mainly consist of intermediate/semi-volatile compounds, and many formulae detected were reported to be the oxidation products of various volatile organic precursors. In summer, the fast photooxidation process generated organic vapors with multiple oxygens and led to an increase in both their mixing ratio and proportion, while, in other seasons, the variations in organic vapors with multiple oxygens were closely correlated with those of organic vapors with 1–2 oxygens, which could be substantially influenced by primary emissions. Organic vapors with low oxygen content (≤ 2 oxygens) are comparable to the results obtained by traditional PTR-MS measurements in both urban Beijing and neighboring regions.

Vascular plants and metazoans use selective proteolysis of transcription factors to control the adaptive responses to hypoxia, although through distinct biochemical mechanisms. The reason for this divergence is puzzling, especially when considering that the molecular components necessary to establish both strategies are conserved across the two kingdoms. To explore an alternative evolutionary scenario where plants sense hypoxia as animals do, we engineered a three-components system aimed to target proteins for degradation in an oxygen dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. Applying the synthetic biology framework, we produced a hypoxia-responsive switch independent of endogenous pathways. When applied to control transcription, the synthetic system partially restored hypoxia responsiveness in oxygen-insensitive mutants. Additionally, we demonstrated its potential to regulate growth under flood-induced hypoxia. Our work highlights the use of synthetic biology to reprogram signalling pathways in plants, providing insights into the evolution of oxygen sensing and offering tools for crop improvement under stress conditions.

Abstract Most massive stars in our universe are born in binary systems, and yet their fates are quite uncertain, due to a poor understanding of their evolution. It is well known, however, that the density profile of a collapsing core, particularly at the interface between silicon and oxygen shells, is important when determining the explodability of a star. While this has been studied for single stars, it has been rarely studied for binary stars. In this note, we explore the explodability of single and binary stars using self-consistent supernova simulations. We study the differences in the silicon–oxygen interface and compactness of the progenitor stars and how they affect the explodability. We find that binary-stripped stars with initial masses above 37 M ⊙ are not as explodable as their single-star counterparts.

Microbial populations are often exposed to long-term abiotic disturbances, which can reduce population viability and cause local extinction. Eco-evolutionary theory suggests that spatial refuges can facilitate persistence and evolutionary rescue. However, one drawback of spatial refuges is reduced exposure to nutrients such as carbon and oxygen, suggesting the protective effect of refuges depends on the interplay between environmental conditions and the degree of stress. Here, we test this general idea using mathematical modelling, and experimental evolution of the model bacterium

The link between the chemistry of the protoplanetary disk and the properties of the resulting planets have long been a subject of interest in the effort to understand planet formation. These connections have generally been made between mature planets and young protoplanetary disks through the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. In a rare number of systems, young protoplanets have been found within their natal protoplanetary disks. These systems offer a unique opportunity to directly study the delivery of gas from the protoplanetary disk to the planet. In this work we post-process 3D numerical simulations of an embedded Jupiter-mass planet in its protoplanetary disk to explore the chemical evolution of gas as it flows from the disk to the planet. The relevant dust to this chemical evolution is assumed to be small co-moving grains with a reduced dust-to-gas ratio indicative of the upper atmosphere of a protoplanetary disk. We find that as the gas enters deep into the planet's gravitational well, it warms significantly (up to $ 800$ K), releasing all of the volatile content from the ice phase. This change in phase can influence our understanding of the delivery of volatile species to the atmospheres of giant planets. The primary carbon, oxygen, and sulphur carrying ices (CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and H$_2$S) are released into the gas phase and along with the warm gas temperatures near the embedded planets lead to the production of unique species such as CS, SO, and SO$_2$ compared to the protoplanetary disk. We compute the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, CS, and H$_2$CS in our model and find that their values are consistent with previous observational studies.

Herein, we report the rational synthesis of porous g-C3N4 co-modified with oxygen (O) and fluorine (F) for the first time. Incorporating colloidal SiO2 during thermal polymerization introduces lattice oxygen, forming C–O bonds, while post-treatment with NH4·HF2 establishes C–F bonds. The dual incorporation of O and F elements extends visible light absorption and effectively promotes the separation and transport of photoexcited charge carriers. Consequently, the co-modified g-C3N4 (O,F-g-C3N4) achieves a 13.2-fold increase in H2 evolution rate compared to pristine g-C3N4. This synthesized O,F-g-C3N4 is then dispersed in waterborne polyurethane (WPU) to create an anti-corrosive coating for Q235 carbon steel substrates. Water resistance, mechanical property, and electrochemical characterization analyses reveal that the O,F-g-C3N4/WPU composite coating exhibits remarkable corrosion resistance with a high protection efficiency of 90.23%. This work offers a straightforward approach for developing highly efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts and corrosion-resistant coatings.

Abstract The possibility of reducing energy costs during hydrogen release was realized using a system in which the anodic process of oxygen release was replaced by the process of dissolution of an electronegative metal (aluminum alloy). The rate of hydrogen release on aluminum, among other equal conditions (temperature and concentration of the electrolyte), depends on the polarization of hydrogen release. On aluminum - a metal of the third group of the periodic table of elements, it is high. The dissolution (corrosion) rate of aluminum can be increased by short-circuiting with an electrode with a low hydrogen evolution polarization, such as nickel. The ratio of hydrogen evolution currents on aluminum and nickel was estimated. The effect of alkali concentration and temperature on the current density, polarization and polarizability of electrodes made of aluminum alloy containing Cu, Mg, Mn and Fe was determined. It was shown that in a 0.1 mol l− 1 NaOH solution at a temperature of 20°C, the polarization resistance of hydrogen release on nickel is lower than on aluminum, and the hydrogen release rate on Ni is higher. At high temperatures and sodium hydroxide concentrations, the polarizability of metal dissolution and hydrogen release on aluminum increases sharply and exceeds those on nickel.

The formation of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) presents challenges such as efficiency losses and fine dust emissions in practical iron combustion systems, highlighting the need for deeper understanding of the formation mechanisms and thermochemical conditions. This study combines experiments and multi-scale simulations to analyze NP clouds generated by single iron particles burning in high-temperature oxidizing environments. The ambient gas conditions were provided by a laminar flat flame burner, with post-flame oxygen mole fractions varied between 20, 30, and 40 vol% at a constant temperature of ~1800K. High-speed in-situ diagnostics were used to measure particle size, NP initiation, NP cloud evolution, and microparticle surface temperature history. The experimental setup utilized three 10kHz imaging systems: one for two-color pyrometry and two for diffusive-backlight illumination (DBI), targeting particle size and NP measurements. The findings showcase the powerful capabilities of multi-physics diagnostics in quantifying NP initiation time and temperature, which depend on particle size and ambient oxygen concentration. CFD simulations revealed enhanced convection velocity driven by increased Stefan flow, which transported NPs toward parent iron particles under high-oxygen conditions. This delayed the detection of NP clouds, leading to higher microparticle temperatures at NP initiation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations uncovered FeO2(g) as a key NP precursor, forming when Fe atoms dissociate from the liquid phase. The initial temperature significantly influenced the resulting nanocluster composition, with Fe(II) dominating at higher temperatures and Fe(III) at lower temperatures. This integrated approach enhances understanding of NP formation in iron combustion, offering insights into the conditions affecting nanoparticle characteristics.

ABSTRACT The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis during the Archean (4–2.5 Ga) required the presence of complementary reducing pathways to maintain the cellular redox balance. While the timing of the evolution of superoxide dismutases (SODs), enzymes that convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and O 2 , within bacteria and archaea is not resolved, the first SODs appearing in cyanobacteria contained copper and zinc in the reaction center (CuZnSOD). Here, we analyse growth characteristics, SOD gene expression (qRT‐PCR) and cellular enzyme activity in the deep branching strain, Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367, previously demonstrated to release significantly more O 2 under anoxic conditions. The observed significantly higher growth rates ( p < 0.001) and protein and glycogen contents ( p < 0.05) in anoxically cultured Pseudanabaena PCC7367 compared to control cultures grown under present‐day oxygen‐rich conditions prompted the following question: Is the growth of Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367 correlated to atmospheric p O 2 and cellular SOD activity? Expression of sodB (encoding FeSOD) and sodC (encoding CuZnSOD) strongly correlated with medium O 2 levels ( p < 0.001). Expression of sodA (encoding MnSOD) correlated significantly to SOD activity during the day ( p = 0.019) when medium O 2 concentrations were the highest. The cellular SOD enzyme activity of anoxically grown cultures was significantly higher ( p < 0.001) 2 h before the onset of the dark phase compared to O 2 ‐rich growth conditions. The expression of SOD encoding genes was significantly reduced ( p < 0.05) under anoxic conditions in stirred cultures, as were medium O 2 levels ( p ≤ 0.001), compared to oxic‐grown cultures, whereas total cellular SOD activity remained comparable. Our data suggest that increasing p O 2 negatively impacts the viability of early cyanobacteria, possibly by increasing photorespiration. Additionally, the increased expression of superoxide‐inactivating genes during the dark phase suggests the increased replacement rates of SODs under modern‐day conditions compared to those on early Earth.

The PBR with layered dielectric spheres is simulated by using the model, indicating that the inner sides of the first layer and the second layer of dielectric spheres are not the main regions for reactions such as CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation; instead, the main regions are along the streamer propagation path and the outer side of the first layer of dielectric sphere. In this work, the propagation of streamers in an electric field is investigated, highlighting the influence of anode voltage rise and dielectric polarization on local electric field enhancement. This enhancement leads the electron density and temperature to increase, which facilitats streamer propagation and the formation of filamentary microdischarges and surface ionization waves. This work provides a detailed analysis of the local electric field evolution at specific points within the PBR, and a further investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of spatial and surface charges, revealing that negative charges concentrate in the streamer and on the dielectric surface, with density being significantly higher than that of positive charges. The positive charge distribution is closely related to the streamer path, and with time going by, the charge distribution becomes dominated in the discharge space. This work also explores the surface charge deposition on the dielectric spheres, and discusses the evolution trend of the distribution. Additionally, this work discusses the temporal and spatial evolution of key plasma species, including ions and radicals, and their contributions to the overall discharge characteristics. The production mechanisms of carbon monoxide particles, carbon dioxide ions, and oxygen ions are analyzed, with a focus on their spatial distribution and correlation with electron density. Finally, the energy deposition within the PBR is examined by integrating the spatial energy deposition of electrons and major positive ions. The results indicate a total energy deposition value of approximately 1.428 mJ/m, with carbon dioxide ions accounting for 8.8% of this value.

Abstract Giant viruses (GVs; Nucleocytoviricota) impact the biology and ecology of a wide range of eukaryotic hosts, with implications for global biogeochemical cycles. Here, we investigated GV niche separation in highly stratified Lake A at the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. This lake is composed of a layer of ice-covered freshwater that overlies saltwater derived from the ancient Arctic Ocean, and it therefore provides a broad gradient of environmental conditions and ecological habitats, each with a distinct protist community and rich assemblages of associated GVs. The upper layer (mixolimnion) had measurable light and oxygen, and contained diverse GVs linked to photosynthetic protists, indicating adaptation to surface biotic and abiotic conditions. In contrast, the saline lower layer (monimolimnion), lacking oxygen and light, hosted GVs associated with predicted heterotrophic protists, some of which are known for a predatory lifestyle, and with several viral genes suggesting adaptation to deep-water anaerobic conditions. Our observations underscore the coupling between physical and chemical gradients, microeukaryotes and their associated GVs in Lake A, and provide insight into the potential for GVs to directly and indirectly impact host metabolism. There were similarities between the genetic composition of GVs and the metabolic processes of their potential hosts, implying co-evolution and niche-adaptation within the lake habitats. Notably, we found a greater presence of viral rhodopsins in deeper water layers, suggesting an evolutionary relationship with potential hosts capable of supplementing their energetic needs to thrive in low energy, anoxic conditions.

We report transport measurements of infinite-layer cuprate Sr$_{1-x}$Eu$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ films with controlled electron (by trivalent europium) and hole (by interstitial apical oxygen) carriers grown on SrTiO$_3$(001) with molecular beam epitaxy. An unusual enhancement of superconductivity upon moderate electron-hole coexistence in the films is found, which spans over the whole superconducting phase diagram and becomes more prominent in the underdoped regime. The superconductivity exhibits a two-dimensional nature with a thickness of approximately 5.2 nm, irrespective of the varying carriers, confirmed by angle-resolved magnetoresistance measurements and the Berzzinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Nevertheless, the electron-hole coexistence enlarges the thermal activation energy of vortex motion that deviates obviously from the usual logarithmic evolution with the magnetic field. Our results offer a promising perspective to understand and enhance the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates.

Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong SN-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).

Understanding the structure evolution of nanoalloys under reaction conditions is vital to the design of active and durable catalysts. Herein, we report an operando measurement of the dynamic lattice strains of dual-noble-metal alloyed with an earth-abundant metal as a model electrocatalyst in a working proton-exchange membrane fuel cell using synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction coupled with pair distribution function analysis. The results reveal an interfacial reaction-triggered oscillatory lattice strain in the alloy nanoparticles upon surface dealloying. Analysis of the lattice strains with an apparent oscillatory irregularity in terms of frequency and amplitude using time-frequency domain transformation and theoretical calculation reveals its origin from a metal atom vacancy diffusion pathway to facilitate realloying upon dealloying. This process, coupled with surface metal partial oxidation, constitutes a key factor for the nanoalloy's durability under the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction condition, which serves as a new guiding principle for engineering durable or self-healable electrocatalysts for sustainable fuel cell energy conversion.

Abstract The formation process plays a key role in developing long life and high energy density materials, during which the phase transition, strain evolution, and structural self‐adaption interact rationally with each other to produce a qualified electrode for Li‐ion batteries (LIBs). Taking the layered LiNi 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 cathode as an example, the substantial structural changes, both in the bulk and at the surface are thoroughly documented during the formation cycle. Upon initial charging, different phases emerge continuously, resulting in lattice mismatches, inhomogeneous strain, and microstructural distortions. The irreversible loss of lattice oxygen, combined with the spontaneous cation mixing and the formation of rock‐salt phase at the surface, contributes to the initial capacity loss. As a self‐adjustment process, this initial capacity loss facilitates the development of a robust Li x Ni 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 electrode by relieving internal strain and stabilizing the rippled layered structure, thereby ensuring highly reversible electrochemical behavior in subsequent cycles. These findings lay a solid foundation for the design and optimization of layered cathodes for rechargeable batteries.

Elemental abundances, particularly the C/O ratio, are seen as a way to connect the composition of planetary atmospheres with planet formation scenario and the disc chemical environment. We model the chemical composition of gas and ices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5\,Myr since its formation to study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth, and phase transitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code FEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution and turbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving component interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation and advection of four volatile species: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. We demonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures on the distribution of volatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one species, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total C/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We identify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for planet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide range of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much narrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value of 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that transiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety of disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with directly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk regions. We show that the ice-phase C/O$\approx0.2-0.3$ between the CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines corresponds to the composition of the Solar system comets, that represent primordial planetesimals.

This case involves a 21-year-old male healthcare student with a medical history of HIV-1 infection for two years and anxiety disorder. He presented to the emergency department with hemoptysis and dyspnea of sudden onset. A thoracic CT scan revealed multiple bilateral nodular ground-glass opacities suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, noninvasive ventilatory support was initiated. A bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the presence of blood. He also showed an elevated troponin I, peaking at 2,915 ng/mL, with no electrocardiographic or echocardiographic abnormalities. Assuming an immune etiology, high-dose corticosteroids were initiated, with three days of methylprednisolone 1 g. However, the entire etiological study for DAH turned out negative. During a follow-up clinical interview, the patient admitted to having self-administered 1 mg of intravenous adrenaline shortly before the onset of symptoms. The patient showed a favorable evolution, with no recurrence of symptoms, allowing for oxygen therapy weaning. A follow-up chest CT on the ninth day of hospitalization showed no significant alterations. This case highlights the importance of a thorough history in determining the etiology of a potentially fatal disease, adding intravenous epinephrine as a potential trigger of hemoptysis due to exogenous agents.

Abstract The early evolution of eukaryotes and their adaptations to low-oxygen environments are fascinating open questions in biology. Genome-scale data from novel eukaryotes, and particularly from free-living lineages, are the key to answering these questions. The Parabasalia are a major group of anaerobic eukaryotes that form the most speciose lineage of Metamonada. The most well-studied are parasitic parabasalids, including Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus, but very little genome-scale data are available for free-living members of the group. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome of Pseudotrichomonas keilini, a free-living parabasalian. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that P. keilini possesses a metabolism and gene complement that are in many respects similar to its parasitic relative T. vaginalis and that in the time since their most recent common ancestor, it is the T. vaginalis lineage that has experienced more genomic change, likely due to the transition to a parasitic lifestyle. Features shared between P. keilini and T. vaginalis include a hydrogenosome (anaerobic mitochondrial homolog) that we predict to function much as in T. vaginalis and a complete glycolytic pathway that is likely to represent one of the primary means by which P. keilini obtains ATP. Phylogenomic analysis indicates that P. keilini branches within a clade of endobiotic parabasalids, consistent with the hypothesis that different parabasalid lineages evolved toward parasitic or free-living lifestyles from an endobiotic, anaerobic, or microaerophilic common ancestor.

The stability of a nanoparticle catalyst during electrochemical reaction is crucial for its application. Despite increasing interest in multi-metallic alloy nanoparticles, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs), for electrocatalysis and emerging models for their catalytic activity, there is limited work on frameworks that can predict the metastability of these alloys under reaction conditions, including stability against electrochemical surface dissolution. Incorporating electrochemical stability in multi-objective optimization would advance HEAs as a catalyst discovery platform. To address the knowledge gap on electrochemical stability, we propose a methodology for simulating the dissolution of n-element alloy nanoparticles comprised of density functional theory and machine learning regression to calculate the dissolution potentials of the surface atoms. We demonstrate the methodology for the Ag-Au-Cu-Ir-Pd-Pt-Rh-Ru HEA system with the conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction. We investigated trends in stability against dissolution through a compositional grid search for the octo-metallic composition space, uncovering two alloying strategies to increase stability against electrochemical surface dissolution: Alloying with a noble metal or a metal with high relative surface energy. In the simulations, stabilization ensues from forming a protective surface layer, and consequently, the dissolution of persistent alloyed nanoparticles results in core-shell structures. The model enables tracing the evolution of the surface and dissolved composition during electrochemical dissolution, forming paths of dissolution and revealing unretainable surface compositions.

Abstract Phosphorus (P) availability throughout geologic time has likely impacted the co-evolution of life and Earth’s environments. Phylogenetic data suggest that phosphate was the primary P-source for microbial life during the Archean, but phosphite, a reduced form of P, became relatively more important leading up towards the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) in the Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic. However, seawater phosphite concentrations during this time, and the potential processes driving this shift in P utilization, are unknown. Here, we performed laboratory experiments simulating the precipitation of banded iron formations (BIFs) as hydrous ferric oxyhydroxides (HFO) in deionized water, diluted seawater, and seawater containing phosphate and phosphite. We also measured phosphite concentrations in BIF samples from four Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic formations. Our results indicate a weaker removal of phosphite compared to phosphate by HFO irrespective of solution chemistry. Paired with measurements of phosphite (up to 0.05–250 ppm) in BIFs, we estimate that seawater phosphite concentration at the onset of the GOE could have reached up to 0.01–0.17 µM. We propose that the preferential removal of phosphate relative to phosphite by HFO, coupled with microbial competition for P facilitated by oxygenic photosynthesis, might have created phosphate-depleted environments, prompting life to exploit alternative P sources such as phosphite.

Abstract Investigations of the metabolic capabilities of anaerobic protists advances our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic life on Earth and for uncovering analogous extraterrestrial complex microbial life. Certain species of foraminiferan protists live in environments analogous to early Earth conditions when eukaryotes evolved, including sulfidic, anoxic, and hypoxic sediment porewaters. Foraminifera are known to form symbioses as well as to harbor organelles from other eukaryotes (chloroplasts), possibly bolstering the host’s independence from oxygen. The full extent of foraminiferal physiological capabilities is not fully understood. To date, evidence for foraminiferal anaerobiosis was gleaned from specimens first subjected to stresses associated with removal from in situ conditions. Here, we report comprehensive gene expression analysis of benthic foraminiferal populations preserved in situ on the euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) bathyal seafloor, thus avoiding environmental alterations associated with sample recovery, including pressure reduction, sunlight exposure, warming, and oxygenation. Metatranscriptomics, metagenome-assembled genomes, and measurements of substrate uptake were used to study the kleptoplastidic foraminifer Nonionella stella inhabiting sulfur-oxidizing bacterial mats of the Santa Barbara Basin, off California. We show N. stella energy generation under dark euxinia is unusual because it orchestrates complex metabolic pathways for ATP production and carbon fixation through the Calvin cycle. These pathways include extended glycolysis, anaerobic fermentation, sulfide oxidation, and the presence of a membrane-bound inorganic pyrophosphatase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes inorganic pyrophosphate to actively pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane.

Abstract Globular clusters (GCs) are sites of extremely efficient star formation, and recent studies suggest they significantly contributed to the early Milky Way’s stellar mass build-up. Although their role has since diminished, GCs’ impact on the Galaxy’s initial evolution can be traced today by identifying their most chemically unique stars—those with anomalous nitrogen and aluminum overabundances and oxygen depletion. While they are a perfect tracer of clusters, be it intact or fully dissolved, these high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] GC-origin stars are extremely rare within the current Galaxy. To address the scarcity of these unusual, precious former GC members, we train a neural network (NN) to identify high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] stars using low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra. Our NN achieves a classification accuracy of approximately $\approx 99~{{\%}}$ and a false positive rate of around $\approx 7~{{\%}}$, identifying 878new candidates in the Galactic field. We validate our results with several physically-motivated sanity checks, showing, for example, that the incidence of selected stars in Galactic GCs is significantly higher than in the field. Moreover, we find that most of our GC-origin candidates reside in the inner Galaxy, having likely formed in the proto-Milky Way, consistent with previous research. The fraction of GC candidates in the field drops at a metallicity of [Fe/H]≈−1, approximately coinciding with the completion of spin-up, i.e. the formation of the Galactic stellar disk.

Underground reservoirs were used to purify water through filtration, adsorption, and biodegradation methods in coal mines. However, their effects on the composition and metabolism of microbial communities in mine water remain unknown. In this study, influent and effluent samples from underground reservoirs in seven coal mining areas were analyzed to compare their microbial community compositions and metabolites. The results indicate that the underground reservoirs can significantly reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels of mine water (values range from 7.79 to 8.50 for influent and 7.40 to 8.50 for effluent) and regulate water chemistry characteristics such as pH (values range from 7–1980 for influent and 5–20 for effluent). Since COD reflects the quantity of reducing substances in water, while total dissolved solids (TDS) indicates the total amount of dissolved solids, both parameters directly influence the physicochemical properties of water. This, in turn, affects microbial growth and metabolic pathways. Consequently, changes in these factors can lead to variations in microbial community composition as well as decreases in the Chao1 and Shannon indices. Underground reservoirs decreased the relative abundance of phyla Actinomycetota and Spirochaetota, and the decreased microbial groups were mainly belonging to phylum Bacillota. In addition, higher concentrations of metabolites, including lipids and lipid-like molecules, mixed metal/nonmetal compounds, hydrocarbon derivatives, nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues were detected in the effluent samples, and most of them were related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, selenocompound metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, and the citrate cycle. In summary, this study provided theoretical and experimental support for the evolution mechanism of mine water quality in coal mine underground reservoirs.

Abstract. Within the oligotrophic subtropical oceans, summertime DIC drawdown despite nutrient limitation in surface waters and subsurface oxygen consumption in the absence of Redfieldian stoichiometric nitrate release are two phenomena still awaiting a full mechanistic characterization. The distribution, intensity and seasonality of these phenomena are identified with preformed nitrate as a tracer, where negative preformed nitrate (NPN) anomalies below the euphotic zone correspond to oxygen consumption without Redfieldian NO3- release, and positive performed nitrate (PPN) anomalies found within the upper 100 m occur where O2 is produced without stoichiometric NO3- drawdown.  Many processes that may contribute to these anomalies including N2 fixation, non-Redfieldian DOM cycling, vertically migrating phytoplankton, heterotrophic NO3- uptake and vertical NO3- injection events have been measured or modelled, yet generally cannot fully account for the magnitudes of preformed nitrate anomalies and excess DIC drawdown observed in many oligotrophic subtropical waters. One other candidate process that may contribute to both phenomena is the formation of carbon-rich transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie-stainable particles (CSP) from dissolved organic precursors in surface waters and their subsequent remineralization below the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). However, few data exist to quantify exopolymer production and vertical distributions in oligotrophic oceans over an annual cycle, which is necessary to understand their potential role in the evolution of seasonal preformed nitrate anomalies and DIC drawdown. To investigate the significance of exopolymer formation and export to North Pacific subtropical gyre biogeochemistry, we undertook a multi-year time-series (Jan 2020 – Sep 2022) analysis of TEP, CSP and total dissolved polysaccharides concentrations at Station ALOHA (22° 45’,158° W), and along a transect from 22° 45’ to 31° N to measure latitudinal variability in June 2021.  Exopolymer C:N stoichiometry at Station ALOHA varied between 16.4 – 34.3, with values being more carbon-rich in summer; ratios were higher (32–38) toward the gyre centre at 31° N. TEP concentrations were consistently elevated in surface waters through Spring–Autumn (4–8 µM C after carbon conversion) at Station ALOHA with lower concentrations (~1.5–3 µM C)  and more uniform vertical distribution during winter, indicating that TEP accumulated in surface waters may vertically sink and be exported with winter mixing. The accumulation of TEP in surface waters through Spring–Autumn and its subsequent export may account for 6.5–20 % of net community production (NCP), helping reduce the estimated imbalance of N supply and N demand at this site to <10 %. The upper ocean TEP cycle may explain 22–67 % of the observed PPN/NPN anomalies, helping to close the C, N, and O2 budgets at station ALOHA, while leaving room for significant contributions from other processes such as vertically migrating phytoplankton and heterotrophic nitrate uptake to be further validated. These results suggest that exopolymer production and cycling may be more important to open ocean carbon biogeochemistry than previously expected, with considerable seasonality and spatial variability influenced by physical processes and phytoplankton activity.

In the quest for novel cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, we studied a family of Li-substituted P2 layered oxides with nominal stoichiometry Na5/6LiyNi5/12-3y/2Mn7/12+y/2O2 (y = 2/18, 3/18, 4/18, 5/18). We explored the consequences of Li substitution, as well as the challenge of elevating the Na content in the pristine materials through solid-state synthesis. By in situ temperature-resolved x-ray diffraction (XRD) we observed the synthesis process, clearly showing the formation of an intermediate Li2MnO3 structure with increasing Li content. Structurally, honeycomb ordering is observed in all samples, while we show that Li induces the loss of Na+/vacancy ordering hence it leads to more disordered Na positions. Electrochemically, this family of materials exhibits an increasing trend of polarized hysteresis in the first cycle, suggesting the contribution of oxygen redox. We coupled semi-simultaneous operando x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and XRD to appreciate the structural evolution and redox behavior during this process. We verified that Li in the transition metal site eliminates phase transitions at high voltage and modifies the activation of O-redox. As confirmed by our XANES analysis and by Density Functional Theory calculations, the Li-free sample already surprisingly show anionic redox despite the residual availability of Ni-redox, due to the peculiar density of states dominated by Ni-O hybridized states at high state of charge. On the other hand, Li-containing samples have O non-bonding states that lead to increasing O-redox contribution as expected due to the limited Ni content. One composition (Na0.745(6)Li0.164(4)Ni0.238(1)Mn0.599(3)O2) proves to have the lowest proportion of O-redox among all samples, coupled with reduced phase transitions, disordered occupancy of Na sites, and small volume change during cycling (4.8%). This material hence delivers the best balance of cycling stability (∼92% after 100 cycles in half cells), capacity (> 100 mAh/g) and rate capability. Determining this optimal compositional range is a promising starting point for further development of P2 layered oxides as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries and can be generalized to other families of Na-based layered oxides with redox-inactive dopants.

A 39-year-old woman underwent bilateral sequential lung transplantation for fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis in May 2022. Her immunosuppression treatment included prednisolone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate. She received one dose of Comirnaty (Pfizer) pre-transplant and tixagevimab–cilgavimab in June 2022. Her first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was diagnosed on 14 December 2022 and she was treated with molnupiravir for five days. On Day 11 of illness, she presented to hospital in respiratory distress with hypoxia (SpO2; 73% on room air). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a cycle threshold of 21.8 (cobas SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A/B, Roche). A chest computed tomography scan demonstrated extensive bilateral ground-glass opacification (Box 1). She required intensive care unit admission for high-flow nasal oxygen (FiO2 60%, flow rate 50 litres) and received tocilizumab, ten days of remdesivir, increased prednisolone, and piperacillin–tazobactam. Three days of pulsed methylprednisolone was prescribed for possible transplant rejection. Despite clinical improvement, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable with a cycle threshold of 16.2 (VIASURE SARS-CoV-2, flu and RSV, Certest Biotec) and SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a cell culture.1 Whole genome sequencing identified Omicron BR.2 (variant of concern B.1.1.529) lineage, with molnupiravir-associated mutational signatures,2 (sequence available on GISAID [Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data]; 26/12/22: hCoV-19/Australia/NSW_ICPMR_40135/2022 and 03/03/23: hCoV-19/Australia/NSW_ICPMR_43136/2023). The patient was transferred to a high acuity respiratory ward after three weeks, but over the ensuing six weeks, became severely deconditioned and continued to require high-flow nasal oxygen (FiO2 30–35%, 35 litres). Chest imaging was stable, demonstrating fibrosis but minimal progressive inflammation. The persistent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 by culture (Box 2) from upper respiratory tract samples prevented participation in enhanced inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation beyond her single room, as per local infection prevention guidelines and hospital policy.3 The policy, based on national guidelines,3 dictated that for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) de-isolation, immunocompromised hosts need to be 21 days post-infection, asymptomatic, and without detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In individuals with persistent RNA detection, a cycle threshold greater than 30 with either positive spike antibody, negative rapid antigen test (RAT) or culture is sufficient for de-isolation. CT = cycle threshold; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The patient received a further dose of tixagevimab–cilgavimab, regular intravenous immunoglobulin and ten further days of remdesivir. Repeat whole genome sequencing did not identify infection with another SARS-CoV-2 lineage nor genomic markers of antiviral resistance.4 Convalescent plasma was not available and administration of virus-specific T-cells was deemed too high risk due to the patient's compromised immune system and fragile respiratory status. The patient received further remdesivir and molnupiravir and was weaned to 1–2 litres of oxygen (FiO2 24–28%). At this point, the patient had been in isolation for 16 weeks as per the de-isolation protocol, requiring dedicated psychosocial input. A novel clearance strategy was subsequently implemented with twice weekly PCR and extended viral culture tests. De-isolation criteria were modified to require two negative cultures, irrespective of cycle threshold value. A decision was made to de-isolate at 25 weeks when no viable virus was isolated after 98 days of diagnosis, and imaging was stable. Coincidentally, PCR cycle threshold was persistently greater than 30. Following rehabilitation, she was discharged after seven months of illness. Persistent viral shedding is increasingly recognised in COVID-19, with recent data suggesting the median duration of viable SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised hosts is four weeks5 in contrast to immunocompetent hosts where SARS-CoV-2 is rarely isolated after ten days.6 Up to 7% of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients shed virus for more than 30 days.7 Although relatively common, there is limited data to guide de-isolation of immunocompromised hosts, impacting infection control, allied health, and resource use.6 Treatment options are also limited, with molnupiravir no longer recommended for treatment in SOT recipients, due to concerns regarding the promotion of viral escape and evolution.2 Further, logistical difficulties in administering outpatient remdesivir, and nirmatrelvir–ritonavir in the context of drug–drug interactions have limited their use. Additionally, this and other novel Omicron strains have been increasingly resistant to sotrovimab and although tixagevimab–cilgavimab retains some in vitro activity, neutralisation is reduced.8 Existing COVID-19 diagnostics, including PCR cycle threshold values and culturable virus, are imperfect surrogates for infectivity.9 Although there is decreased likelihood of isolating replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 from samples with cycle threshold values greater than 30, correlation in immunocompromised hosts with protracted shedding is less established. Moreover, there is variability among immunocompromised hosts, with SOT recipients less likely to shed viable virus than haematological transplant recipients.10 Heterogeneity in this patient population might be further influenced by differences in immunity following infection or vaccination.11 In immunocompromised hosts with persistent shedding, RATs may be a useful clearance test as the negative predictive value increases from 48% to 92% after 20 days,5 and as a collective approach, PCR, viral culture and RATs can be useful in complex cases. De-isolation strategies vary across Australia, with national guidelines potentially leading to long periods of isolation.3, 12 The exclusion of immunocompromised hosts from many studies on which these recommendations are based means it is difficult to extrapolate data to this cohort.11 To mitigate this, individual patient assessment by multidisciplinary teams to determine timing for de-isolating immunocompromised hosts with persistent SARS-CoV-2 detection is practised at some transplant centres. Contemporaneous resources on vaccination regimens, immunosuppressant modulation and updated de-isolation guidelines have since been released, reflecting the changing requirements for immunocompromised hosts with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation.12 Ultimately, this case highlights the difficulty in managing protracted SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant recipients, emphasising the need for patient-specific therapeutic management and adaptable approaches to infection control in complex immunocompromised hosts.

quality was proposed. This model revealed favorable lithofacies in deltaic sand bodies could form lithologic traps, which have important exploration and development value for lithologic hydrocarbon reservoirs.proposed an improved stacked model with a gate network module to predict the permeability of tight sandstone reservoirs. The GNS model can automatically evaluate the impact of various logging parameters and significantly improve the prediction accuracy, which helps to enhance the reliability of tight reservoir evaluation parameters.He et al. established a data-driven fracture propagation model and fracture channeling identification method, successfully explains the reason for cross-well fracture channeling, and its conclusion aligns with the actual monitoring results.Shi et al. proposed a method to characterize the regional distribution of complex multi-layer migration pathways for oil and gas in the paleo-slope zone outside petroliferous basins' source kitchens. This study established a method creatively for determining the threshold for oil and gas migration along sandbodies and faults, and it improves the exploration efficiency of petroleum in areas with similar geological conditions like eastern basins in China.Zhang et al. study the dynamic loss process and the molecular changes of hydrocarbons in preserved shale samples exposed in open air for different time, and reveal that there is a large amount of oil loss of about 42% to 78% for samples with maturity %Ro between 1.01 and 1.53. The oil loss is mainly contributed by free oil, while adsorbed oil remains unchanged. NMR T1-T2 mapping can be an important method to estimate in-situ fluid saturation without sample crushing.Dong et al. employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) to analyze the descriptive topological and geometric features of carbonate samples from the Gaoshitti-Moxi area of the Sichuan Basin, compared the corresponding experimental results, and developed a novel comprehensive characterization approach for its parameters, which is conducive to characterizing the pore structure of carbonate rock.Zhou et al. characterized the source rocks and the structural evolution history is restored by using 2D-Move software. The characteristics of reservoirs and caps are clarified, and the controlling factors of reservoir formation are summarized. The sandstone reservoir has fracture and dissolution porosity, which provide storage space for oil accumulation. Faults and unconformities provide pathways for oil migration. The dense basalt is a good cap layer to preserve the reservoir. The research results are of great significance to guide future oil and gas exploration in the Liaohe Basin.Li et al. revealed the main controlling factors of reservoir heterogeneity in the Jiaxian area through thin rock sections, scanning electron microscopy, high-pressure mercury intrusion, and conventional property analysis. The multi-stage metamorphic hydrocarbon expulsion process in coal seams enriched the organic-inorganic interactions in coal-bearing strata, adding some reservoir capacity.Zhang et al. proposed a new method for dynamic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing of shale gas by borehole-to-surface Transient Electromagnetic Methods (BSTEM). By combining field-based shale gas fracturing monitoring models, the response patterns of the borehole-to-surface transient electromagnetic field under different fracturing stages are analyzed, which can guide importance for the application of borehole-to-surface transient electromagnetic methods in monitoring hydraulic fracturing of shale gas.Wang et al. constructed a three-dimensional model using hydraulic fracturing software based on the discrete lattice theory and synthetic rock mass method. The effect of a relatively short cluster spacing (5 m or less) on fracture propagation behavior was investigated through a series of case studies, considering operational parameters (injection rate, the number of fractures) and reservoir parameters (reservoir Young's modulus, stress anisotropy, principal stress direction).Wang et al. employed a well-seismic fusion method, incorporating RGB seismic attribute fusion technology, to classify and detail the sedimentary architecture of thin-layer beach-bar sand bodies in Niger's G oilfield. By integrating seismic attributes and well-logging data, it identifies the spatial distribution and connectivity of sand bodies, presenting a comprehensive architecture classification. These findings enhance the fine characterization of thin-layer beach-bar reservoirs, supporting efficient reservoir development and offering an important methodological reference for similar geological settings.He et al. explored the necessity of switching from water injection to natural gas injection in the fault-controlled fracture-cavity reservoir in Shunbei. They studied the optimization of natural gas injection parameters and methods, analyzed the natural gas displacement mechanism, optimized well pattern layout and injection-production parameters, and constructed an evaluation system for natural gas injection. This improves reservoir development efficiency and oil production rate, reduces the risk of gas channeling, and provides technical support for oil and gas field development.Li et al. based on a systematic study of the noble gas and stable isotope characteristics of normally-pressured shale gas samples, revealed the origin of noble gas from normally-pressured shale gas reservoirs and discussed the accumulation and expulsion mechanisms of normally-pressured shale gas in the tectonically complex margin of the southeastern Sichuan Basin. The result can provide insights into the enrichment mechanism of shale gas reservoirs and the prediction of shale gas production capacity in other structurally complex regions of the world.Wang et al. analyzed the Carboniferous Dawuba and Cambrian Niutitang shales in the Upper Yangtze Platform, South China, revealing their paleoenvironmental conditions and gas potential. Dawuba shales formed in warm, arid, reducing conditions, while Niutitang shales experienced cooler, arid climates. Both have high gas generation potential, with Dawuba featuring Type II2 kerogens and Niutitang Type I. Despite low gas content, promising exploration areas include the Qiannan Depression's Shangyuan and Zongdi regions.Fu et al. investigated the influence of extensional strike-slip fault systems on hydrocarbon accumulation in the Bohai Bay Basin's Huanghekoudong and Miaoxi'nan sub-sags. Utilizing three-dimensional seismic data, new sequence stratigraphic frameworks, and advanced analysis techniques, they develop a model detailing how these systems shape sub-sag evolution and trap formation. This research enhances understanding of structural trapping dynamics, providing crucial insights for exploration strategies in similar geological settings globally.Yuan et al. proposed a method for the identification of complex lithology of tight marl reservoir based on logging data. Lithological identification of 2D and 3D plots is established using sensitive GR, DEN, and RT. Corresponding identification standards are built in two hierarchies. The lithological characteristics of vertical, horizontal, and plane are discussed in the research area, which may aid in understanding the complex marl reservoir in the Leikoupo Formation 32 Submember of the Sichuan Basin, China.Meng et al. found that the factors that influence the CO 2 injectivity are CO 2 injection rate, reservoir pressure, formation water saturation, and permeability, respectively. The oil recovery is mainly influenced by CO 2 injection rate and formation permeability, and the influences of reservoir pressure and water saturation on oil recovery are smaller. To improve the CO 2 injectivity, the threshold values for radial perforation and fracture half-length are 25 m and 50 m. The different provenance controls the distribution of sedimentary facies in the vertical and lateral directions, which in turn controls the spatial distribution of the grain size and clastic composition. The study of provenance analysis and sediment transport can integrate tectonics, climate, provenance lithotypes, transport dynamics, and burial diagenesis, which can provide a comprehensive understanding of unconventional reservoirs. Wang et al. studied the seasonal deltaic deposits in the Cretaceous red bed of the Tarim Basin. As seasonal deltaic deposits were still not well studied in previous research, a concept depositional model about seasonal deltaic deposits was proposed in this research. This model revealed different types of distributary channels in Cretaceous arid paleoclimate, which have important value for both delta sedimentology and deltaic hydrocarbon reservoir exploration. Lan et al. used the Jurassic asphalt found in the QD1 well, combined with the source rocks of drilling cores and outcrops, and explored the possible hydrocarbon source and forming process in the Ruoqiang Sag using oil-source correlation and hydrocarbon accumulation geochronology methods. Peng et al. analyzed beach-bar reservoirs in Qinghai Lake, NW China, linked to unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs. It highlights the influence of lake-level fluctuations, wind wave dynamics, sediment provenance, and terrain gradient on beach bar formation and morphology. Large-scale fluctuations set initial conditions, while small-scale ones refine features. Wind dynamics define depth zones, affecting morphology. Beach bars are categorized by sediment provenance: bedrock, alluvial fan, and braided river systems. Terrain gradients under 0.7 degrees favor formation, aiding hydrocarbon exploration and sedimentary geology. Wang et al. spectral analysis and wavelet transform are used to study the high frequency Milankovitch sedimentary cycle in Fengcheng Formation. A high resolution astronomical age scale is established, and the 2-stage sedimentary cycle and 8-layer sweet spot are identified. Qi et al. take the Chang 6 lobate delta in the Wuliwan area of the Jing'an Oilfield in the Yishan Slope of the Ordos Basin as an example, this study sets parameters including sediment grain size, hydraulic conditions, and slope gradient similar to those underground to simulate the evolution of the shallow-water delta in the research area through flume experiments, dissect its internal configuration characteristics, establish a sedimentary model, and provide guidance for water flooding adjustments in the oilfield. Dong et al. based on the observation and description of drilling cores, carbon and oxygen isotope tests, inclusion analysis, logging data analysis, and seismic data interpretation, they depict the filling architecture, analyze the stages of collapse-filling, and discuss the differential evolution process and associated filling mechanism of typical paleounderground rivers.Machine learning and artificial intelligence are of great value to the research of unconventional reservoirs. Wei et al. presented a hybrid feature selection method that integrates hyperspectral data with machine learning for precise estimation of dolomite content in carbonate rocks. This non-destructive approach improves the accuracy of field-based mineral identification and facilitates more detailed geological surveys, offering practical significance for oil resource assessment and exploration.
