Abstract Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were sandwiched into interlayers between ZIF‐8 and ZIF‐67 to form ZIF‐Co 3 O 4 @ZIF precursors. Pyrolysis of ZIF‐Co 3 O 4 @ZIF yielded an urchin‐like hierarchically porous carbon (Co@CNT/NC), the thorns of which were carbon nanotubes embedded Co nanoparticles. With large specific surface area and hierarchically porous structure, as‐prepared Co@CNT/NC exhibited excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performances. It has good ORR performance with E 1/2 of 0.85 V, which exceeds the Pt/C half‐wave potential (E 1/2 =0.83 V). In addition, Co@CNT/NC has an OER performance close to that of RuO 2 . To further demonstrate the effect of Co modifying on the properties, the samples were subjected to acid washing treatment. Co‐based nanoparticles were proved to After acid washing, there was obvious loss of Co particles in Co@CNT/NC, resulting in poor oxygen electrocatalysis. So, the pyrolysis products of ZIF‐8‐Co 3 O 4 @ZIF‐67 retained large specific surface area and porous structure can be retained, and on the other hand, the carbon tube structure and original polyhedron framework. Besides, existence of Co nanoparticle@carbon nanotube provided more active sites and improved the ORR and OER performances.

Abstract The development of bifunctional catalysts with subtle structures, high efficiencies and good durabilities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for overall water splitting. In this work, a multicomponent S-doped NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe micronano flower electrocatalyst was synthesized rapidly on foam copper using a simple one-step constant current electrodeposition method. The introduction of S leads to the transformation of the microsphere structure of the Ni-Fe alloy into a cauliflower-like morphology and induces changes in the surface electronic structure, significantly enhancing the catalytic performance for the HER and OER. The S-NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe alloy/CF showed low overpotentials of 220 mV and 66 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH for the OER and HER, respectively. High durability OER and HER performances were demonstrated through 60 h of chronopotentiometry and 6000 CV cycles test. Excellent overall water splitting electrocatalytic activity was observed in the S-NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe alloy/CF‖S-NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe alloy/CF two-electrode system. In particular, active-phase NiOOH, a highly active substance for OER, can be controllably formed in the reaction process owing to the nanoflower structure of multi-layer sulfur which slows down the dissolution of NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe alloy. These results suggest that this composite structure is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst.&#xD;

Abstract Precisely modulating the Ru-O covalency in RuO x for enhanced stability in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is highly desired. However, transition metals with d -valence electrons, which were doped into or alloyed with RuO x , are inherently susceptible to the influence of coordination environment, making it challenging to modulate the Ru-O covalency in a precise and continuous manner. Here, we first deduce that the introduction of lanthanide with gradually changing electronic configurations can continuously modulate the Ru-O covalency owing to the shielding effect of 5 s /5 p orbitals. Theoretical calculations confirm that the durability of Ln-RuO x following a volcanic trend as a function of Ru-O covalency. Among various Ln-RuO x , Er-RuO x is identified as the optimal catalyst and possesses a stability 35.5 times higher than that of RuO 2 . Particularly, the Er-RuO x -based device requires only 1.837 V to reach 3 A cm −2 and shows a long-term stability at 500 mA cm −2 for 100 h with a degradation rate of mere 37 μV h −1 .

Reducing iridium (Ir) catalyst loading for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical strategy for large-scale hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. However, simultaneously achieving high activity, long-term stability, and reduced material cost remains challenging. To address this challenge, we develop a framework by combining density functional theory (DFT) prediction using model surfaces and proof-of-concept experimental verification using thin films and nanoparticles. DFT results predict that oxidized Ir monolayers over titanium nitride (IrO

Abstract The cycling stability of LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 under high voltages is hindered by the occurrence of hybrid anion‐ and cation‐redox processes, leading to oxygen escape and uncontrolled phase collapse. In this study, we propose an interfacial engineering strategy involving a straightforward mechanical ball milling and low‐temperature calcination, employing a Se‐doped and FeSe 2 &Fe 2 O 3 ‐modified approach to design a stable Ni‐rich cathode. Se 2− are selectively adsorbed within oxygen vacancies to form O‐TM‐Se bond, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen, and preventing structural distortion. Simultaneously, the Se‐NCM811//FeSe 2 //Fe 2 O 3 self‐assembled electric field is activated, improving interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, FeSe 2 accelerates Li + diffusion and reacts with oxygen to form Fe 2 O 3 and SeO 2 . The Fe 2 O 3 coating mitigates HF erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, limiting the outward migration of oxygen anions. Impressively, the modified materials exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 79.7% after 500 cycles at 1C under 4.5 V. Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 94.6% in 3 – 4.25 V after 550 cycles in pouch‐type full battery. This dual‐modification approach demonstrates its feasibility and opens new perspectives for the development of stable lithium‐ion batteries operating at high voltages.

Abstract Earth‐abundant metal oxides are usually considered as stable but catalytically inert towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their unfavorable hydrogen intermediate adsorption performance. Herein, a heavy rare earth (Y) and transition metal (Co) dual‐doping induced lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy is proposed to boost CeO 2 towards robust alkaline HER. The induced lattice compression and increased oxygen vacancy (O v ) concentration in CeO 2 synergistically improve the water dissociation on O v and sequential hydrogen adsorption at activated O v ‐neighboring sites, leading to significantly enhanced HER kinetics. Meanwhile, Y doping offers stabilization effect on O v by its stronger Y−O bonding over Ce−O, which endows the catalyst with excellent stability. The Y,Co‐CeO 2 electrocatalyst exhibits an ultra‐low HER overpotential (27 mV at 10 mA cm −2 ) and Tafel slope (48 mV dec −1 ), outperforming the benchmark Pt electrocatalyst. Moreover, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporated with Y,Co‐CeO 2 achieves excellent stability of 500 h under 600 mA cm −2 . This synergistic lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy sheds new light on the rational development of efficient and stable oxide‐based HER electrocatalysts.

Abstract Technically viable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) must be both active and stable under the harsh conditions at an electrolyser anode. While numerous highly active metal‐oxide catalysts have been identified, only very few are sufficiently stable, with iridium oxides being the most prominent. In this perspective, we draw insights from OER mechanisms to circumvent the activity‐stability conundrum generally plaguing the development of OER catalysts. In the commonly considered OER mechanisms, one or several metal‐oxygen (M−O) bonds are required to be broken along the OER pathway, providing a mechanistic link between the OER and oxide decomposition. However, a recently discovered mechanism on crystalline iridium dioxide provides a new OER pathway without M−O bond breakages, thus enabling the combination of sufficient activity and stability.

Using renewable steam-exploded poplar (SEP) as carbon source, nickel metal doped carbon hybrid materials were designed to synthesize catalysts (Ni/SEP) with certain oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties and were compared with nickel catalysts supported on metal organic framework structure (ZIF67-Ni). The roles of SEP support in Ni-based catalyst were considered. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images confirmed that the fiber could better hinder the aggregation of metal particles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) indicated the presence of surface OH groups after the reduction process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the major form of metallic Ni in the resulting Ni catalysts. Carbon materials as carriers, the synergetic effect of Ni-doped, and carbon carrier played an important role in facilitating the kinetics of OER, which was similar to the carrier of metal-organic frame material. Notably, the Ni/SEP (11.3 mF/cm-2) and ZIF67-Ni (37.2 mF/cm-2) with better OER performance exhibited a smaller double layer capacitances (Cdl), suggesting the intrinsic OER catalytic activity of the Ni/SEP and ZIF67-Ni were much higher in comparison to the ZIF67-Ni/SEP. Moreover, the inferior performance of Ni/SEP further indicated that the synergistic effect between carbon and Ni/NiO contributes to the enhanced OER activity.

The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal‐organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni‐based MOFs. Through an artificial‐intelligence (AI) data‐mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d‐band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3‐5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in‐depth understanding of structure–activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni‐based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF‐based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.

Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor represents a promising approach to industrial‐level H2O2 production, while it is hampered by the lack of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts in acidic medium. Herein, we present a strategy for the specific oxygen functional group (OFG) regulation to promote the H2O2 selectivity up to 92% in acid on cobalt‐porphyrin molecular assembled with reduced graphene oxide. In‐situ X‐ray adsorption spectroscopy, in‐situ Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy combined with theoretical calculation unravel that different OFGs exert distinctive regulation effects on the electronic structure of Co center through either remote (carboxyl and epoxy) or vicinal (hydroxyl) interaction manners, thus leading to the opposite influences on the promotion in 2e‐ ORR selectivity. As a consequence, the PEM electrolyzer integrated with the optimized catalyst can continuously and stably produce the high‐concentration of ca. 7 wt% pure H2O2 aqueous solution at 400 mA cm‐2 over 200 h with a cell voltage as low as ca. 2.1 V, suggesting the application potential in industrial‐scale H2O2 electrosynthesis.

Ni‐rich cathodes have been intensively adopted in Li‐ion batteries to pursuit high energy density, which still suffering irreversible degradation at high voltage. Some unstable lattice O2‐ species in Ni‐rich cathodes would be oxidized to singlet oxygen 1O2 and released at high volt, which lead to irreversible phase transfer from the layered rhombohedral (R) phase to a spinel‐like (S) phase. To overcome the issue, the amphiphilic copolymers (UMA‐Fx) electrolyte were prepared by linking hydrophobic C‐F side chains with hydrophilic subunits, which could self‐assemble on Ni‐rich cathode surface and convert to stable cathode–electrolyte interphase layer. Thereafter, the oxygen releasing of polymer coated cathode was obviously depressed and substituted by the Co oxidation (Co3+→Co4+) at high volt (>4.2V), which could suppressed irreversible phase transfer and improve cycling stability. Moreover, the amphiphilic polymer electrolyte was also stable with Li anode and had high ion conductivity. Therefore, the NCM811//UMA‐F6//Li pouch cell exhibited outstanding energy density (362.97 Wh/kg) and durability (cycled 200 times at 4.7V), which could be stalely cycled even at 120℃ without short circuits or explosions.

Abstract Alkaline zinc‐iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are well suited for energy storage because of their good safety, high cell voltage, and low cost. However, the occurrence of irreversible anodic parasitic reactions results in a diminished coulombic efficiency (CE), unbalanced charge state of catholyte/anolyte and subsequently, a poor cycling performance. Here, we report a universal CE compensation strategy centered around the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodic side. This strategy aims to equalize the charge state of the [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3‐/4− ‐based catholyte and counteract pH fluctuations. The OER process can be implemented either directly on the electrode through electrochemical reaction or in an external catalytic reactor column via a redox‐mediated process. This innovative approach effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3− in discharged catholyte and [Zn(OH) 4 ] 2− in charged anolyte by consuming the extra OH − during continuous cycling process. As a result, AZIFBs demonstrated exceptional cycling performance with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0128%/day (or 0.0005%/cycle) over 600 cycles at 80% state of charge (SOC). The proposed CE compensation strategy not only provides an effective way to address the CE loss issue for AZIFBs but can also be applied to diverse battery technologies encountering CE loss caused by water/oxygen‐induced parasitic reactions.

Herein, a self‐supported, robust, and noble‐metal‐free 3D hierarchical interface‐rich Fe‐doped Co‐LDH@MoS2‐Ni3S2/NF heterostructure electrocatalyst has been prepared through a controllable two‐step hydrothermal process. The resultant electrode shows low overpotential of ⁓95 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ⁓220 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the two‐electrode system requires only a cell voltage of ⁓1.54 V at 10 mA cm−2 current density, respectively. Extensive ab initio calculations were carried out to find out the overpotential for HER, orbital interaction through the determination of electron density of states and quantification of charge transfer by Bader charge analysis. The computed overpotential matched closely with the experimental data. The superior HER performance of the tri‐layer is enhanced due to the charge transfer (1.7444e) to Fe‐doped Co‐LDH from Ni3S2‐MoS2 hybrid. This research strategy paves an effective pathway for affordable green H2 production and future efficient non‐precious bifunctional electrocatalyst design for overall water electrolysis.

Abstract The potential of electrochemical water splitting to tackle energy and environmental issues has garnered substantial interest. In the present work, an effective ZnS/In 2 Te 3 has been constructed by hydrothermal support on a stainless‐steel strip and explored for oxygen evolution. The addition of ZnS modifies the band structure of In 2 Te 3 and enhances its specific conductivity and capacitance on an intrinsic level, making rapid ion transportation. The optimized ZnS/In 2 Te 3 displayed efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 228 mV and a Tafel slope of 111 mV dec −1 with cyclic activity up to 1000 cycles in 1 M KOH solution. ZnS/In 2 Te 3 has a large surface area (28 m 3 g −1 ) and a charge capacitance of (.037 mF), according to studies using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and double‐layer capacitance. Combining several strategies improves overall electrochemical performance of ZnS/In 2 Te 3 , making it a promising option for use in state‐of‐the‐art OER.

A series of monometallic Ni‐, Co‐ and Zn‐MOFs and bimetallic NiCo‐, NiZn‐ and CoZn‐MOFs M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M’)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, with the same pillar and layer linkers 4‐diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene‐1,4‐dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave‐assisted thermal conversion synthesis method within only 12 min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M’ was 4:1. The mono‐ and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic‐activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301 mV and Tafel slopes of 42 mV dec−1 on a glassy carbon electrode in 1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, NiCoMOF was in situ grown in just 25 min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) where overpotentials of 313 and 328 mV at current densities of 50 and 300 mA cm–2, respectively, were delivered and superior long‐term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27 mV dec−1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement (Rfar = 2 Ω), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite.

Despite the widespread investigations on the M‐N‐C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure‐property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well‐designed pH‐dependent metal leaching experiments and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M‐N‐C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni‐N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni‐O coordination. The formed Ni‐O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.

Antiferroelectric (AFE) ZrO2-based devices are anticipated to exhibit superior endurance properties in comparison to their ferroelectric (FE) counterparts. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of AFE devices remain elusive. In this study, guided by the dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies (Vo), we reveal three kinds of fatigue in AFE HfxZr1−xO2 (HZO) during uni-directional cycling. The first mechanism is related to the interfacial Vo charge trapping, which accelerates the switching from the P↓↑ state to the P↓↓ state, leading to extrinsic fatigue, and is demonstrated by electrical stress measurements. The other two mechanisms are Vo-related AFE to FE phase transition (PT) and Vo localization inside the HZO films, which are supported by the first-principles calculations. The highest polarization switching barrier occurs when Vo is localized at the tetra-coordinated oxygen sites inside HZO films. This means that tetra-coordinated Vo accumulation leads to less polarization switching, resulting in AFE to FE PT and Vo localization induced fatigue, i.e., intrinsic fatigue. This work reveals the dynamic evolution of Vo during cycling and its impact on AFE properties, paving the way for developing more durable AFE ZrO2-based devices and contributing to the emergence of diverse recovery methods in the future.

Although Ru‐based materials are among the outstanding catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the instability issue still haunts them and impedes the widespread application. The instability of Ru‐based OER catalysts is generally ascribed to the formation of soluble species through the over‐oxidation of Ru and structural decomposition caused by involvement of lattice oxygen. Herein, an effective strategy of selectively activating the lattice oxygen around Ru site is proposed to improve the OER activity and stability. Our synthesized spinel‐type electrocatalyst of Ru and Zn co‐doped Co3O4 showed an ultralow overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and a long‐term stability reaching to 100 hours at 10 mA cm‐2 for alkaline OER. The experimental results and theoretical simulations demonstrated that the lattice oxygen site jointly connected with the octahedral Ru and tetrahedral Zn atoms became more active than other oxygen sites near Ru atom, which further lowered the reaction energy barriers and avoided generating excessive oxygen vacancies to enhance the structural stability of Ru sites. The findings hope to provide a new perspective to improve the catalytic activity of Ru‐incorporated OER catalysts and the stability of lattice‐oxygen‐mediated mechanism.

Designing bifunctional catalysts to reduce the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) reaction barriers while accelerating the reaction kinetics is perceived to be a promising strategy to improve the performance of Zinc-air batteries. Unsymmetric configuration in single-atom catalysts has attracted attention due to its unique advantages in regulating electron orbitals. In this work, a seesaw effect in unsymmetric Fe-Co bimetallic monoatomic configurations is proposed, which can effectively improve the OER/ORR bifunctional activity of the catalyst. Compared with the symmetrical model of Fe-Co, a strong charge polarization between Co and Fe atoms in the unsymmetric model is detected, in whom the spin-down electrons around Co atoms are much higher than those spin-up electrons. The seesaw effect occurred between Co atoms and Fe atoms, resulting in a negative shift of the d-band center, which means that the adsorption of oxygen intermediates is weakened and more conducive to their dissociation. The optimized reaction kinetics of the catalyst leads to excellent performance in ZABs, with a peak power density of 215 mW cm

The generation of clean, zero-carbon, and renewable energy is a challenge for the development of a sustainable and egalitarian society. Hydrogen gas can be produced by water electrolysis and has been claimed as the most promising option to replace fossil fuels. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most energetically demanding step of the water splitting and requires the use of electrocatalysts to overcome the kinetic barrier. Iron oxide nanomaterials have been emerging as a low-cost and Earth-abundant OER electrocatalysts. The synthesis of iron oxide assisted by plant extract is an eco-friendly approach to obtain nanomaterials with unique properties. Herein, we investigated iron oxide synthesized with the assistance of Camellia sinensis extract, under different experimental conditions towards oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. Pure phases of iron oxide were obtained, ferrihydrite and maghemite showed overpotentials of 460 and 480 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 , respectively. After calcination, hematite was formed and the overpotential was raised to 610 and 810 mV, respectively. The lower overpotential of the amorphous materials could be related to the lower electron transfer resistance and faster reaction rate. On the other hand, the calcinated materials presented higher specific activity, stability and higher Faradaic efficiency.

The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal‐organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni‐based MOFs. Through an artificial‐intelligence (AI) data‐mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d‐band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3‐5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in‐depth understanding of structure–activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni‐based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF‐based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.

Despite the widespread investigations on the M‐N‐C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure‐property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well‐designed pH‐dependent metal leaching experiments and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M‐N‐C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni‐N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni‐O coordination. The formed Ni‐O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.

Ni‐rich cathodes have been intensively adopted in Li‐ion batteries to pursuit high energy density, which still suffering irreversible degradation at high voltage. Some unstable lattice O2‐ species in Ni‐rich cathodes would be oxidized to singlet oxygen 1O2 and released at high volt, which lead to irreversible phase transfer from the layered rhombohedral (R) phase to a spinel‐like (S) phase. To overcome the issue, the amphiphilic copolymers (UMA‐Fx) electrolyte were prepared by linking hydrophobic C‐F side chains with hydrophilic subunits, which could self‐assemble on Ni‐rich cathode surface and convert to stable cathode–electrolyte interphase layer. Thereafter, the oxygen releasing of polymer coated cathode was obviously depressed and substituted by the Co oxidation (Co3+→Co4+) at high volt (>4.2V), which could suppressed irreversible phase transfer and improve cycling stability. Moreover, the amphiphilic polymer electrolyte was also stable with Li anode and had high ion conductivity. Therefore, the NCM811//UMA‐F6//Li pouch cell exhibited outstanding energy density (362.97 Wh/kg) and durability (cycled 200 times at 4.7V), which could be stalely cycled even at 120℃ without short circuits or explosions.

N-regulated three-dimensional (3D) turf-like carbon material loaded with FeCoNi nanoalloys (F-CNS-CNT), composed of carbon nanotubes (CNT) grown in situ on carbon nanosheets(CNS), was synthesized using a low-temperature solution combustion method and organic compounds rich in pyridinic-N. This distinct structure significantly expands the effective electrochemical surface area, revealing an abundance of active sites and enhancing the mass transfer capability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations corroborate that the synergy between the FeCoNi nanoalloy and the highly pyridinic N-doped carbon substrate optimizes the adsorption and desorption-free energy of oxygen intermediates, resulting in a remarkable improvement of intrinsic ORR/OER activity. Therefore, the derived F-CNS-CNT electrocatalyst can present a favorable half-wave potential of 0.85 V (ORR) and a lower overpotential of 260 mV (corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm

The quality of in situ XAS of electrochemical systems is highly sensitive to electrode disturbances, such as gas evolution and gas consumption at an electrolyte / catalyst interface. A novel in situ spectro‐electrochemical X‐ray absorption spectroscopy cell is presented as a new tool for the characterisation of gas evolving and consuming electrocatalysts at high overpotentials. By utilising a thin, porous membrane with efficient electrolyte and gas circulating loops, an improved three phase interface that enabled efficient gas supply and minimised the interference from bubble formation. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted in fluorescence mode with three experiments selected to demonstrate the cell’s performance. The first two reactions; an in‐situ study of a highly active amorphous iridium oxide catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction and an in‐situ study of copper oxide during the carbon dioxide reduction reaction are used to exemplify the XAS data quality achieved under operational conditions. Thirdly, a detailed XAS investigation of a highly dispersed platinum catalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction is presented, along with comparative data in nitrogen. These measurements show the retention of oxygen on the surface of the platinum metal particles down to 0.48 V (vs. RHE), well below the platinum oxide reduction peak.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting offers an advancing approach to producing highly pure hydrogen and oxygen, motivated by the prevalence of a low‐carbon economy and the goal of a sustainable future. The customized modulation of electronic structures enables the electrocatalyst to directionally promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a promising shortcut to overall water splitting (OWS). Herein, 3D homologous WSeS/CoSeS heterojunction nanoarrays (WSeS/CoSeS NAs) and W‐doped CoSeS nanoarrays (W‐CoSeS NAs) are investigated. Abundant heterointerfaces within WSeS/CoSeS NAs facilitate HER kinetics, boosting mass diffusivity, and increasing carrier separation and transfer process. High‐valence W 6+ doping into CoSeS prevents phase separation and stabilizes Co sites by charge offset effect, leading to enhanced OER. Consequently, the WSeS/CoSeS NAs and W‐CoSeS NAs reach 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of 43.8 and 233.3 mV in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, when asymmetrically engaged as an electrolyzer, this configuration exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performances (cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm −2 ) with satisfying stability and mechanical robustness (over 1000 h at 1000 mA cm −2 ). The modulation and manufacture of reaction‐property‐oriented materials are experimentally and theoretically validated potential, illuminating the light of inspiration for multiple applications.

Abstract Owing to great energy density, eco-friendliness, safety and security, and cost-effectiveness, rechargeable metal-air batteries (MABs) have engrossed substantial devotion. The MABs signify one of the most feasible forthcoming alternatives to powering electric vehicles (EVs) and smart-grid energy storage. The progress of MABs has offered a solution benefitting from its much higher theoretical energy density than that of lithium-ion batteries (LIB). However, certain technical difficulties allied with metal-air batteries include sluggish electrochemical oxygen reaction kinetics that has yet to be fixed. The transition single metal and mixed metals sulfides (TMS) nanostructures have validated an advanced electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, due to their higher electronic conductivity and fast-charge transfer kinetics. The bifunctional electrocatalytic act of the TMSs can be enhanced by altering the electronic configuration, double layer structure and interface, valence state, and vacancies. In this minireview, the preparation, properties, and testing of electrode components of transition metal sulfides (TMS) nanomaterials towards different types of metal-air batteries (aqueous and non-aqueous), the fundamentals, configuration of battery, choice of electrode materials, electrolyte, and separator, current challenges as well as perspectives of the design of high-performance MABs are also discussed based on the existing execution.

Metal atom catalysts have been among the most important research objects due to their specific physical and chemical properties. However, precise control of the anchoring of metal atoms is still challenging to achieve. Cobalt and iridium atomic arrays formed sequentially ordered stable arrays in graphdiyne (GDY) triangular cavities depending on their intrinsic chemical properties and interactions. The success of this method was attributed to multifunctional integration of GDY, enabling selective growth from one to several atoms and various atomic densities. The bimetallic atom arrays show several advantages resulting from reducibility of acetylene bonds, space limiting effect, incomplete charge transfer between GDY and metal atoms, and sp‐C hybridized triple bond skeleton. This well‐designed system exhibits unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a mass activity of 2.6 A mgcat.–1 at a low overpotential of 300 mV, which is 216.6 times higher than the state‐of‐the‐art IrO2 catalyst, and long‐term stability.

Robust engineering of two-dimensional (2D) materials via covalent grafting of organic molecules has been a great strategy for permanently tuningtheir physicochemical behaviors toward electrochemical energy applications. Herein, we demonstrated that a covalent functionalization approach of graphitic surfaces including graphene by a graftable porphyrin (g-Por) derivative, abbreviated as g-Por/HOPG or g-Por/G, is realizable. The efficiency of this approach is determined at both the molecular and global scales by using a state-of-the-art toolbox including cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Consequently, g-Por molecules were proven to covalently graft on graphitic surfaces via C-C bonds, resulting in the formation of a robust novel hybrid 2D material visualized by AFM and STM imaging. Interestingly, the resulting robust molecular material was elucidated as a novel bifunctional catalyst for both the oxygen evolution (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in acidic medium with highly catalytic stability and examined at the molecular level. These findings contribute to an in-depth understanding at the molecular level ofthe contribution of the synergetic effects of molecular structures toward the water-splitting process.

Abstract Although lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs) hold great promise as future energy storage systems, they are impeded by insulated discharge product Li 2 O 2 and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution revolution (ORR/OER) kinetics. The application of a highly efficient cathode catalyst determines the LOBs performance. The d‐band modulation and catalytic kinetics promotion are important concept guidelines for the performance enhancement of cathode catalysts. In this work, the homogeneous in‐plane distortion‐derived synergistic catalytic capability of an Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 catalyst with modulated d‐band centers and promoted ORR/OER kinetics is demontrated. The uniform elongation of Ag─O bonds and compression of Mo─O bonds in (020) plane leads to d‐band splitting and d‐band center optimization and delivers improved adsorption behavior for high ORR/OER capability. Furthermore, the spatial and energy overlap of Ag d xz and O 2 anti‐bonding π * orbitals facilitate electron injection during ORR process and reduce the energy barrier for charge transfer and O 2 desorption during OER process, accelerating the ORR/OER kinetics. As a result, the (020) plane‐exposed Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 cathode exhibits ultralong cycle stability of 817 cycles at 500 mA g −1 and large specific discharge/charge capacities of 15898/15180 mAh g −1 . This work provides facile concept guidance for optimizing catalytic capability through controlled lattice distortion in cathode catalysts for LOBs.

Electrocatalytic water splitting driven by sustainable energy is a clean and promising water-chemical fuel conversion technology for the production of high purity green hydrogen. However, the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pose challenges for large-scale hydrogen production, limiting its efficiency and safety. Recently, the anodic OER has been replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with biomass as the substrate and coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has attracted great interest. Anode NOR offers faster kinetics, generates high-value products, and reduces energy consumption. By coupling NOR with hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production efficiency can be enhanced while yielding high-value oxidation products or degrading pollutants. Therefore, NOR-coupled HER hydrogen production is another new green electrolytic hydrogen production strategy after electrolytic water hydrogen production, which is of great significance for realizing sustainable energy development and global decarbonization. This review explores the potential of nucleophilic oxidation reactions as an alternative to OER and delves into NOR mechanisms, guiding future research in NOR-coupled hydrogen production. It assesses different NOR-coupled production methods, analyzing reaction pathways and catalyst effects. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of electrolyzers in industrialized NOR-coupled hydrogen production and discusses future prospects and challenges. This comprehensive review aims to advance efficient and economical large-scale hydrogen production. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

We have demonstrated a single‐crystal‐to‐single‐crystal (SCSC) transformation from a two‐dimensional noninterpenetrated layer to a microporous three‐dimensional fourfold interpenetrated MOF. The centrosymmetric [Co 2 (μ 2 ‐OH)(EIBA) 3 ] n ( SNUT‐25 ) transforms into a microporous [Co(EIBA) 2 ] n ( SNUT‐26 ), which is triggered by the reaction time with DMF that acts as a structure‐directing agent (HEIBA = 4‐(2‐ethyl‐1H‐imidazol‐1‐yl)benzoic acid; DMF = N,N′‐dimethylformamide). Despite the distinct structure and coordination arrangements of SNUT‐25 in contrast to SNUT‐26 , both Co‐MOFs were synthesized using the same ligand. Fascinatingly, upon introducing a specific quantity of DMF combined with a negligible proportion of nitric acid, SNUT‐25 will progressively and completely transform into SNUT‐26 . Under the synergistic induction of solvent molecules and temperature, SNUT‐25 changed from the original two‐dimensional layered structure to the three‐dimensional pore structure of SNUT‐26 . In addition, SNUT‐25 and SNUT‐26 are efficient photocatalysts for the degradation of organic dye methyl blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. Surprisingly, the degradation rates of both SNUT‐25 and SNUT‐26 can reach over 96%. In addition, SNUT‐25 and SNUT‐26 also exhibited high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.

Abstract The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) is of significance in regards of environmentally friendly issues and green ammonia production. However, relatively low performance with a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a challenge to overcome for the NO 3 RR. In this study, oxygen vacancy‐controlled copper oxide (CuO x ) catalysts through a plasma treatment are successfully prepared and supported on high surface area porous carbon that are co‐doped with N, Se species for its enhanced electrochemical properties. The oxygen vacancy‐increased CuO x catalyst supported on the N,Se co‐doped porous carbon (CuO x ‐H/NSePC) exhibited the highest NO 3 RR performance with faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87.2% and yield of 7.9 mg cm −2 h −1 for the ammonia production, representing significant enhancements of FE and ammonia yield as compared to the un‐doped or the oxygen vacancy‐decreased catalysts. This high performance should be attributed to a significant increase in the catalytic active sites with facilitated energetics from strategies of doping the catalytic materials and weakening the N─O bonding strength for the adsorption of NO 3 − ions on the modulated oxygen vacancies. This results show a promise that co‐doping of heteroatoms and regulating of oxygen vacancies can be key factors for performance enhancement, suggesting new guidelines for effective catalyst design of NO 3 RR.

Ultramassive white dwarfs with masses $M\gtrsim 1.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ probe extreme physics near the Chandrasekhar limit. Despite the rapid increase in observations, it is still unclear how many harbour carbon-oxygen (CO) versus oxygen-neon (ONe) cores. The origin of these white dwarfs and their strong magnetic fields - single stellar evolution or a stellar merger - is another open question. The steep mass-radius relation of the relativistic ultramassive white dwarfs shortens their crystallization time $t_{\rm cryst}$, such that the recently proposed crystallization dynamo mechanism may present an alternative to mergers in explaining the early appearance of magnetism in the observed population. However, the magnetic diffusion time from the convective dynamo to the white dwarf's surface delays the magnetic field's breakout time $t_{\rm break}>t_{\rm cryst}$. We compute $t_{\rm break}(M)$ for CO and ONe ultramassive white dwarfs and compare it to the local 40 pc volume-limited sample. We find that the breakout time from CO cores is too long to account for the observations. ONe crystallization dynamos remain a viable option, but their surrounding non-convective envelopes comprise only a few per cent of the total mass, such that $t_{\rm break}$ is highly sensitive to the details of stellar evolution.

Manganese, a 3d transition metal, with variable oxidation states(-3 to +7) is ubiquitous in earth’s crust, has low toxicity, and as a catalyst in cyanobacterial photosynthesis accumulated oxygen in the ocean which gradually escaped into the atmosphere displacing methane sometime between 2.4 – 2.1 billion years ago1. Cyanobacteria evolved from an anaerobic environment to produce oxygen which wiped out much of anaerobic life and gave rise to aerobic metabolism. Manganese thus plays a central role in evolution. Biophysical and biochemical studies of manganese as biocatalysts is described from a chemical and biological perspective in this chapter. The dissertation work done by the author dictates the choices in this chapter that are thus more like vignettes considering the vast amount of ongoing work in the area of Manganese bio catalysis. Manganese as a catalyst that produces hydrogen from water might turn out to be the key to a carbon neutral green economy of the future.

Using density functional theory (DFT), this work explores barium zirconate doped with nitrogen. In addition, we used density functional theory (DFT) to study the BaZrO$_3$'s electrical, optical, and structural properties, and we found that the BaZrO$_3$ has intrinsic vacancy defects by employing the supercell approach. Integrating testability into hardware devices is the goal of testing design, an approach to integrated circuit design that draws on density functional theory. This technology simplifies production testing and implementation. The study strategy incorporates the following methods: LSDA+U, Exchange Correlation Approximations, Hohenberg Kohn Theorem, and Local Spin Density Approximation. We tracked the evolution of barium zirconate's protonic, nitrogen ionic, and electronic conductivities using Density Functional Theory (DFT). We found low electrical conductivity despite the fact that nitrogen doping successfully lowered energy barriers for oxygen and proton ion migration. The conductivity of barium zirconate increased in proportion to the supercell's nitrogen content. Furthermore, we investigated the local arrangements of octahedral sites in Pm3m cubic frameworks and utilized Density Functional Theory to dope BaZrO$_3$. Nitrogen doping caused a lot of changes to oxygen sites, revealing three groups of oxygen atoms with different structural properties.

Abstract JWST observations of the seven-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will provide an excellent opportunity to test outcomes of stellar-driven evolution of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, including atmospheric escape, ocean loss, and abiotic oxygen production. While most previous studies use a single luminosity evolution for the host star, we incorporate observational uncertainties in stellar mass, luminosity evolution, system age, and planetary parameters to statistically explore the plausible range of planetary atmospheric escape outcomes. We present probabilistic distributions of total water loss and oxygen production as a function of initial water content, for planets with initially pure water atmospheres and no interior–atmosphere exchange. We find that the interior planets are desiccated for initial water contents below 50 Earth oceans. For TRAPPIST-1e, f, g, and h, we report maximum water-loss ranges of    8.0   − 0.9   + 1.3    ,    4.8   − 0.4   + 0.6    ,    3.4   − 0.3   + 0.3    , and    0.8   − 0.1   + 0.2    Earth oceans, respectively, with corresponding maximum oxygen retention of    1290   − 75   + 75    ,    800   − 40   + 40    ,    560   − 25   + 30    , and    90   − 10   + 10    bars. We explore statistical constraints on initial water content imposed by current water content, which could inform evolutionary history and planet formation. If TRAPPIST-1b is airless while TRAPPIST-1c possesses a tenuous oxygen atmosphere, as initial JWST observations suggest, then our models predict an initial surface water content of 8.2     − 1.0   + 1.5    Earth oceans for these worlds, leading to the outer planets retaining >1.5 Earth oceans after entering the habitable zone. Even if TRAPPIST-1c is airless, surface water on the outer planets would not be precluded.

Carbon deposits consisting of vertically oriented multilayer graphene sheets on metallic foils represent an interesting alternative to activated carbon in electrical and electrochemical devices such as super-capacitors because of the superior electrical conductivity of graphene and huge surface–mass ratio. The graphene sheets were deposited on cobalt foils by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using propane as the carbon precursor. Plasma was sustained by an inductively coupled radiofrequency discharge in the H mode at a power of 500 W and a propane pressure of 17 Pa. The precursor effectively dissociated in plasma conditions and enabled the growth of porous films consisting of multilayer graphene sheets. The deposition rate varied with time and peaked at 100 nm/s. The evolution of surface wettability was determined by the sessile drop method. The untreated substrates were moderately hydrophobic at a water contact angle of about 110°. The contact angle dropped to about 50° after plasma treatment for less than a second and increased monotonously thereafter. The maximal contact angle of 130° appeared at a treatment time of about 30 s. Thereafter, it slowly decreased, with a prolonged deposition time. The evolution of the wettability was explained by surface composition and morphology. A brief treatment with oxygen plasma enabled a super-hydrophilic surface finish of the films consisting of multilayer graphene sheets.

EPAS1HIF2a is the primary gene implicated in systemic hypoxia adaptation. Conversely, aberrantly activated EPAS1HIF2a acts as a tumor driver against which anti-tumor therapeutics are proven effective. We elucidated connections between adaptation to systemic hypoxia in high-altitude populations, such as Tibetans and Sherpas, and human tumors. Similar to the accelerated adaptability observed in high-altitude populations via genetic introgression, tumors from patients with hypoxia since birth exhibited impaired DNA repair and increased mutation burden. As in high-altitude dwellers, EPAS1HIF2a genetic variants were positively selected within sympathetic tumors developed under hypoxia, with a consistently high frequency of 90%. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing followed by in vitro studies have shown that hypoxia and EPAS1HIF2a gain-of-function tumor mutations induce COX4i2 expression and impair mitochondrial respiration, indicating that decreased cellular oxygen consumption may confer a proliferative advantage in hypoxia. Analyzing medical data from a patient cohort with hypoxia since birth who developed/did not develop tumors revealed tissue-specific and time-dependent tumorigenic effects of systemic hypoxia, which is limited to oxygen-sensitive and responsive cells, particularly during the postnatal period. This study supports connections between the EPAS1HIF2a genetic adaptation in human tumors developed under systemic hypoxia to populations living in high altitudes. The genetic adaptations in populations to different stressors can be explored further to understand tumorigenesis and tumor evolution.

Abstract Complex multi-element alloys are gaining prominence for structural applications, supplementing steels, and superalloys. Understanding the impact of each element on alloy surfaces due to oxidation is vital in maintaining material integrity. This study investigates oxidation mechanisms in these alloys using a model five-element equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn alloy, in a controlled oxygen environment. The oxidation-induced surface changes correlate with each element’s interactive tendencies with the environment, guided by thermodynamics. Initial oxidation stages follow atomic size and redox potential, with the latter becoming dominant over time, causing composition inversion. The study employs in-situ atom probe tomography, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure techniques to elucidate the oxidation process and surface oxide structure evolution. Our findings deconvolute the mechanism for compositional and structural changes in the oxide film and will pave the way for a predictive design of complex alloys with improved resistance to oxidation under extreme conditions.

Abstract Geological evidence indicates that a supernova within 100 parsecs of Earth occurs around once per million years. Such nearby supernovas can produce an intense gamma-ray burst and a 100-fold increase of cosmic rays, lasting several centuries. We find that the effect of a short burst of gamma rays is small since they are strongly attenuated before reaching the lower stratosphere. Intense cosmic radiation affects stratospheric ozone but, due to compensating effects in catalytic chemical cycles, ozone depletion is moderate and comparable to that from current anthropogenic emissions. This also holds for the low-oxygen atmosphere during early evolution of terrestrial life. We estimate the increase in aerosol and clouds from a 100-fold increase of cosmic rays exerts a radiative forcing comparable in magnitude but opposite in sign to current anthropogenic climate forcing. We conclude that Earth’s atmosphere is effective at shielding the biosphere from nearby supernovae.

Abstract Anthropogenic stressors can have an impact in a broad range of physiological processes and can be a major selective force leading to rapid evolution and local population adaptation. In this study, three populations of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii were investigated. They are geographically separated for at least 20 years, and live in different abiotic environments: a freshwater inland lake (Salagou lake) with no major anthropogenic influence and two other coastal wetlands regularly polluted by pesticides along the Mediterranean coast (Camargue region and Bages-Sigean lagoon). Collected adults were genetically characterized using the mitochondrial COI gene and haplotype frequencies were analyzed for genetic variability within and between populations. Results revealed a higher genetic diversity for these invasive populations than any previous report in France, with more than seven different haplotypes in a single population. The contrasting genetic diversity between the Camargue and the other two populations suggest different times and sources of introduction. To identify differences in key physiological responses between these populations, individuals from each population were maintained in controlled conditions. Data on oxygen consumption rates indicate that the Salagou and Bages-Sigean populations possess a high inter-individual variability compared to the Camargue population. The low individual variability of oxygen consumption and low genetic diversity suggest a specific local adaptation for the Camargue population. Population-specific responses were identified when individuals were exposed to a pesticide cocktail containing azoxystrobin and oxadiazon at sublethal concentrations. The Salagou population was the only one with altered hydro-osmotic balance due to pollutant exposure and a change in protease activity in the hepatopancreas. These results revealed different phenotypic responses suggesting local adaptations at the population level.

Life harnessing light energy transformed the relationship between biology and Earth-bringing a massive flux of organic carbon and oxidants to Earth's surface that gave way to today's organotrophy- and respiration-dominated biosphere. However, our understanding of how life drove this transition has largely relied on the geological record; much remains unresolved due to the complexity and paucity of the genetic record tied to photosynthesis. Here, through holistic phylogenetic comparison of the bacterial domain and all photosynthetic machinery (totally spanning >10,000 genomes), we identify evolutionary congruence between three independent biological systems-bacteria, (bacterio)chlorophyll-mediated light metabolism (chlorophototrophy), and carbon fixation-and uncover their intertwined history. Our analyses uniformly mapped progenitors of extant light-metabolizing machinery (reaction centers, [bacterio]chlorophyll synthases, and magnesium-chelatases) and enzymes facilitating the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (form I RuBisCO and phosphoribulokinase) to the same ancient Terrabacteria organism near the base of the bacterial domain. These phylogenies consistently showed that extant phototrophs ultimately derived light metabolism from this bacterium, the last phototroph common ancestor (LPCA). LPCA was a non-oxygen-generating (anoxygenic) phototroph that already possessed carbon fixation and two reaction centers, a type I analogous to extant forms and a primitive type II. Analyses also indicate chlorophototrophy originated before LPCA. We further reconstructed evolution of chlorophototrophs/chlorophototrophy post-LPCA, including vertical inheritance in Terrabacteria, the rise of oxygen-generating chlorophototrophy in one descendant branch near the Great Oxidation Event, and subsequent emergence of Cyanobacteria. These collectively unveil a detailed view of the coevolution of light metabolism and Bacteria having clear congruence with the geological record.

Ab initio calculations have achieved remarkable success in nuclear structure studies. Numerous works highlight the pivotal role of three-body forces in nuclear ab initio calculations. Concurrently, efforts have been made to replicate these calculations using only realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. A novel local chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) NN interaction, distinct due to its weaker tensor force, has recently been established. This paper applies this local NN interaction in ab initio frameworks to calculate the low-lying spectra of p-shell light nuclei, particularly 10B, ground-state energies and shell evolution in oxygen isotopes. Results are compared with calculations utilizing nonlocal chiral N3LO NN and chiral NN +3N interactions. The ab initio calculations with the local N N potential accurately describe the spectra of p-shell nuclei, notably the 10B. Additionally, the neutron drip line for oxygen isotopes, with 24O as the drip line nucleus, is accurately reproduced in ab initio calculations with the local NN interaction. Calculations with the local NN interaction also reproduce the subshell closure at N = 14 and 16, albeit with a stronger shell gap compared to experimental data. However, the calculated charge radii based on the local NN interaction are underestimated compared with experimental data, which is similar to results from the nonlocal NN interaction. Consequently, the present ab initio calculations further indicate significant spin-orbit splitting effects with the new local NN potential, suggesting that 3N forces remain an important consideration.

Vascular pathologies are prevalent in a broad spectrum of diseases, necessitating a deeper understanding of vascular biology, particularly in overcoming the oxygen and nutrient diffusion limit in tissue constructs. The evolution of vascularized tissues signifies a convergence of multiple scientific disciplines, encompassing the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into vascular cells, the development of advanced three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques, and the refinement of bioinks. These technologies are instrumental in creating intricate vascular networks essential for tissue viability, especially in thick, complex constructs. This review provides broad perspectives on the past, current state, and advancements in key areas, including the differentiation of hPSCs into specific vascular lineages, the potential and challenges of 3D bioprinting methods, and the role of innovative bioinks mimicking the native extracellular matrix. We also explore the integration of biophysical cues in vascularized tissues in vitro , highlighting their importance in stimulating vessel maturation and functionality. In this review, we aim to synthesize these diverse yet interconnected domains, offering a broad, multidisciplinary perspective on tissue vascularization. Advancements in this field will help address the global organ shortage and transform patient care.

Abstract This article describes a novel dataset on non‐diamondiferous eclogite and garnet pyroxenite xenoliths from four kimberlite pipes of the Ekati Diamond Mine (Central Slave Craton, Canada). Xenoliths brought to the surface by kimberlite eruptions are direct sources of information on the composition and evolution of the Earth's mantle. Eclogite and garnet pyroxenite xenoliths, specifically, are testimony of subduction into, and metasomatism of, the mantle beneath cratons. Furthermore, these rocks are major hosts for diamond and thus an important part of the deep carbon cycle. The sample suite consists of 41 small xenoliths (2–5 cm) recovered from drill cores. The dataset includes major and trace element concentrations for garnet, clinopyroxene and ilmenite, as well as stable oxygen isotope compositions of garnets. Strontium and neodymium isotopic compositions are reported for garnet and clinopyroxene for four samples which were large enough to allow for analysis. Overall, this dataset significantly expands and complements existing datasets on diamondiferous and non‐diamondiferous xenoliths from the Slave Craton in Canada, furthering our understanding of the composition of the Slave subcratonic lithosphere. The dataset includes several samples with rare mineral assemblages, including an olivine‐bearing eclogite as well as ilmenite and apatite‐bearing garnet‐pyroxenites, and thus provides data shedding light on rarely reported compositional nuances in xenolith suites found in kimberlites.

Abstract Proton exchange‐membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a clean and efficient type of energy storage device. However, the sluggish reaction rate of the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been a significant problem in its development. This review reports the recent progress of advanced electrocatalysts focusing on the interface/surface electronic structure and exploring the synergistic relationship of precious‐based and non‐precious metal‐based catalysts and support materials. The support materials contain non‐metal (C/N/Si, etc.) and metal‐based structures, which have demonstrated a crucial role in the synergistic enhancement of electrocatalytic properties, especially for high‐temperature fuel cell systems. To improve the strong interaction, some exciting synergistic strategies by doping and coating heterogeneous elements or connecting polymeric ligands containing carbon and nitrogen were also shown herein. Besides the typical role of the crystal surface, phase structure, lattice strain, etc., the evolution of structure‐performance relations was also highlighted in real‐time tests. The advanced in situ characterization techniques were also reviewed to emphasize the accurate structure‐performance relations. Finally, the challenge and prospect for developing the ORR electrocatalysts were concluded for commercial applications in low‐ and high‐temperature fuel cell systems.

Abstract Spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiters measure their emission spectra at multiple orbital phases, thus enabling detailed characterisation of their atmospheres. Precise constraints on the atmospheric composition of these exoplanets offer insights into their formation and evolution. We analyse four phase-resolved emission spectra of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, generated from a phase curve observed with the MIRI/LRS onboard the JWST, to retrieve its atmospheric properties. Using a parametric 2D temperature model and assuming a chemically homogeneous atmosphere within the observed pressure region, we simultaneously fit the four spectra to constrain the abundances of atmospheric constituents, thereby yielding more precise constraints than previous work that analysed each spectrum independently. Our analysis reveals statistically significant evidence of NH3 (4σ) in a hot Jupiter’s emission spectra for the first time, along with evidence of H2O (6.5σ), CO (3.1σ), and a non-detection of CH4. With our abundance constraints, we tentatively estimate the metallicity of WASP-43b at 0.6−6.5 × solar and its C/O ratio at 0.6−0.9. Our findings offer vital insights into the atmospheric conditions and formation history of WASP-43b by simultaneously constraining the abundances of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen-bearing species.

The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g‐C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z‐scheme photocatalyst through self‐assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g‐C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z‐scheme heterojunction formation between g‐C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z‐scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco‐benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.

Abstract The proliferation of microbial carbon fixation is a key control on the evolution of the biosphere and global carbon cycle. Most records of these metabolisms in ancient rocks come from organic matter or fossils, which are not always preserved. Here, we present a potential proxy for microbial carbon fixation (autotrophy) based on the isotopic composition of carbonate minerals. Autotrophs influence carbonate chemistry in the cellular microenvironment by decreasing CO 2 concentration and increasing the carbonate saturation state. This can induce rapid precipitation of carbonate minerals that are out of isotopic equilibrium with their environment. Recent work has identified disequilibrated dual clumped isotope compositions (∆ 47 and ∆ 48 ) in the skeletal fossils of marine calcifying organisms. Here we test whether the same is true of non‐skeletal carbonate fabrics associated with microbial autotrophs in modern and Eocene lakes. We found that microbial carbonate formed via autotrophic metabolism recorded lower ∆ 47 and higher ∆ 48 values (−∆ 47 /+∆ 48 ) than predicted for thermodynamic equilibrium mineral formation. Our findings are supported by models of dual clumped isotope kinetics in the DIC system, and disequilibrium in the oxygen isotope system. We hypothesize that the inverse trajectory away from the equilibrium line (+∆ 47 /−∆ 48 ) should be recorded by carbonates formed in association with alkalinizing heterotrophs, such as sulfate reducers. If so, carbonate dual clumped isotopes could be a powerful tool to identify the proliferation and rate of heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolisms in the carbonate rock record on Earth and (perhaps) other planets.

Optimizing electrosynthetic reactions requires fine tuning of a vast chemical space, including charge transfer at electrocatalyst/electrode surfaces, engineering of mass transport limitations, and complex interactions of reactants and products with their environment. Hybrid electrolytes, in which supporting salt ions and substrates are dissolved in a binary mixture of organic solvent and water, represent a new piece of this complex puzzle as they offer a unique opportunity to harness water as the oxygen or proton source in electrosynthesis. In this work, we demonstrate that modulating water-organic solvent interactions drastically impacts the solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes. Combining various spectroscopies with synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the size and composition of aqueous domains forming in hybrid electrolytes can be controlled. We demonstrate that water is more reactive for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous domains than when strongly interacting with solvent molecules, which originates from a change in reaction kinetics rather than a thermodynamic effect. We exemplify novel opportunities arising from this new knowledge for optimizing electrosynthetic reactions in hybrid electrolytes. For reactions proceeding first via the activation of water, fine tuning of aqueous domains impacts the kinetics and potentially the selectivity of the reaction. Instead, for organic substrates reacting prior to water, aqueous domains have no impact on the reaction kinetics, while selectivity may be affected. We believe that such a fine comprehension of solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes can be transposed to numerous electrosynthetic reactions.

Abstract. Within the oligotrophic subtropical oceans, summertime DIC drawdown despite nutrient limitation in surface waters and subsurface oxygen consumption in the absence of Redfieldian stoichiometric nitrate release are two phenomena still awaiting a full mechanistic characterization. The distribution, intensity and seasonality of these phenomena are identified with preformed nitrate as a tracer, where negative preformed nitrate (NPN) anomalies below the euphotic zone correspond to oxygen consumption without Redfieldian NO3- release, and positive performed nitrate (PPN) anomalies found within the upper 100 m occur where O2 is produced without stoichiometric NO3- drawdown. Many processes that may contribute to these anomalies including N2 fixation, non-Redfieldian DOM cycling, vertically migrating phytoplankton, heterotrophic NO3- uptake and vertical NO3- injection events have been measured or modelled, yet generally cannot fully account for the magnitudes of preformed nitrate anomalies and excess DIC drawdown observed in many oligotrophic subtropical waters. One other candidate process that may contribute to both phenomena is the formation of carbon-rich transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie-stainable particles (CSP) from dissolved organic precursors in surface waters and their subsequent remineralization below the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). However, few data exist to quantify exopolymer production and vertical distributions in oligotrophic oceans over an annual cycle, which is necessary to understand their potential role in the evolution of seasonal preformed nitrate anomalies and DIC drawdown. To investigate the significance of exopolymer formation and export to North Pacific subtropical gyre biogeochemistry, we undertook a multi-year time-series (Jan 2020 – Sep 2022) analysis of TEP, CSP and total dissolved polysaccharides concentrations at Station ALOHA (22° 45’,158° W), and along a transect from 22° 45’ to 31° N to measure latitudinal variability in June 2021. Exopolymer C:N stoichiometry at Station ALOHA varied between 16.4 – 34.3, with values being more carbon-rich in summer; ratios were higher (32–38) toward the gyre centre at 31° N. TEP concentrations were consistently elevated in surface waters through Spring–Autumn (4–8 µM C after carbon conversion) at Station ALOHA with lower concentrations (~1.5–3 µM C) and more uniform vertical distribution during winter, indicating that TEP accumulated in surface waters may vertically sink and be exported with winter mixing. The accumulation of TEP in surface waters through Spring–Autumn and its subsequent export may account for 6.5–20 % of net community production (NCP), helping reduce the estimated imbalance of N supply and N demand at this site to <10 %. The upper ocean TEP cycle may explain 22–67 % of the observed PPN/NPN anomalies, helping to close the C, N, and O2 budgets at station ALOHA, while leaving room for significant contributions from other processes such as vertically migrating phytoplankton and heterotrophic nitrate uptake to be further validated. These results suggest that exopolymer production and cycling may be more important to open ocean carbon biogeochemistry than previously expected, with considerable seasonality and spatial variability influenced by physical processes and phytoplankton activity.

Cancers can manifest large variations in tumor phenotypes due to genetic and microenvironmental factors, which has motivated the development of quantitative radiomics-based image analysis with the aim to robustly classify tumor phenotypes in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be particularly helpful in elucidating the metabolic profiles of tumors. However, the relatively low resolution, high noise, and limited PET data availability make it difficult to study the relationship between the microenvironment properties and metabolic tumor phenotype as seen on the images. Most of previously proposed digital PET phantoms of tumors are static, have an over-simplified morphology, and lack the link to cellular biology that ultimately governs the tumor evolution. In this work, we propose a novel method to investigate the relationship between microscopic tumor parameters and PET image characteristics based on the computational simulation of tumor growth. We use a hybrid, multiscale, stochastic mathematical model of cellular metabolism and proliferation to generate simulated cross-sections of tumors in vascularized normal tissue on a microscopic level. The generated longitudinal tumor growth sequences are converted to PET images with realistic resolution and noise. By changing the biological parameters of the model, such as the blood vessel density and conditions for necrosis, distinct tumor phenotypes can be obtained. The simulated cellular maps were compared to real histology slides of SiHa and WiDr xenografts imaged with Hoechst 33342 and pimonidazole. As an example application of the proposed method, we simulated six tumor phenotypes that contain various amounts of hypoxic and necrotic regions induced by a lack of oxygen and glucose, including phenotypes that are distinct on the microscopic level but visually similar in PET images. We computed 22 standardized Haralick texture features for each phenotype, and identified the features that could best discriminate the phenotypes with varying image noise levels. We demonstrated that “cluster shade” and “difference entropy” are the most effective and noise-resilient features for microscopic phenotype discrimination. Longitudinal analysis of the simulated tumor growth showed that radiomics analysis can be beneficial even in small lesions with a diameter of 3.5–4 resolution units, corresponding to 8.7–10.0 mm in modern PET scanners. Certain radiomics features were shown to change non-monotonically with tumor growth, which has implications for feature selection for tracking disease progression and therapy response.

Abstract The Paleozoic Aktogai Group in Kazakhstan ranks among the thirty largest porphyry Cu deposits globally. The Aktogai deposit is the largest one in the Aktogai Group and is characterized by intensive potassic alteration where the dominant orebody occurred. However, its mineralization processes remain unclear. Our investigation focused on the texture, trace elements, fluid inclusions, and in-situ oxygen isotopes of the quartz from the ore-related tonalite porphyry and associated potassic alteration at Aktogai to trace the deposit’s mineralization processes. Ti-in-quartz thermobarometry, fluid inclusion microthermometry, and geological characteristics indicate that the ore-related magma at Aktogai originated from a shallow magma chamber at ~1.9±0.5 kbar (~7.2±1.9 km) and intruded as the tonalite porphyry stock at ~1.7-2.4 km. The potassic alteration and associated Cu mineralization comprise five types of veins (A1, A2, B1, B2, and C) and two types of altered rocks (biotite and K-feldspar). Among them, nine types of hydrothermal quartz were identified from early to late: (1) VQA1 in A1 veins and RQbt in biotite altered rocks, (2) VQA2 in A2 veins and RQkfs in K-feldspar altered rocks, (3) VQB1 in B1 veins and VQB2E in B2 veins, and (4) quartz associated with Cu-Fe sulfides (VQB2L, VQBC, and VQC) in B and C veins. Titanium contents of the quartz decreased, while Al/Ti ratios increased from early to late. Fluid inclusion microthermometry and mineral thermometers reveal that VQA1, RQbt, and hydrothermal biotite formed under high-temperature (~470-560 °C) and ductile conditions. VQA2, RQkfs, VQB1, and hydrothermal K-feldspar formed during the transition stage from ductile to brittle, with temperatures of ~350-540 °C. The rapid decrease in pressure from lithostatic to hydrostatic pressure led to fluid boiling and minor involvement of meteoric water (~11-14 %) in the mineralizing fluid. Extensive recrystallization in VQA1 to VQB1 was associated with repeated cleavage and healing of the intrusion. With cooling, K-feldspar decomposition and hydrolysis increased. Fluid cooling and water-rock reactions resulted in the co-precipitation of Cu-Fe sulfides, white mica, chlorite, VQBC, and VQC, with temperatures of ~275-370 °C and brittle conditions. The Paleozoic Aktogai deposit exhibits formation depths and fluid evolution processes similar to Mesozoic and Cenozoic PCDs worldwide. The close association between Cu-Fe sulfides and later quartz formed under intermediate-temperature conditions at Aktogai implies that Cu-Fe sulfides are not precipitated during early high-temperature conditions in porphyry Cu deposits.
