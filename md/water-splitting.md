The discovery of acid-stable and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in the quest for high-performance water-splitting technologies. Herein, a heterostructured RuO2–CeO2 electrocatalyst was constructed by using a lattice-matching strategy. The interfacial Ru–O–Ce bridge structure provided a channel for electron transfer between Ru and Ce, creating a lattice stress that distorts the local structure of RuO2. The resulting RuO2–CeO2 catalyst exhibited attractive stability with negligible decay after 1000 h of the OER in 0.5 M H2SO4, along with high activity with an overpotential of only 180 mV at 10 mA cm–2. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to reveal that the interface and noninterface RuO2 sites enabled an oxide path mechanism (OPM) and the enhanced adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM-plus), respectively, during the OER. The simultaneous and independent OER pathways accessible by lattice matching guides improved electrocatalyst design for the OER in acidic media.

Intermediates in the overall water splitting on particulate photocatalysts were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap. In situ EPR spectra under ultraviolet light showed the exclusive formation of a hydroxyl radical adduct (•DMPO-OH) over Ga2O3 and NaTaO3:La without a Rh–Cr oxide cocatalyst. In contrast, the Rh–Cr oxide cocatalyst-loaded photocatalysts active for water splitting formed a 5,5-dimethyl-2-oxo-pyrroline-1-oxyl radical (•DMPOX). •DMPOX is suggested as an indicator of the surface peroxyl radical intermediate (M-OO•) in the oxygen evolution reaction pathway.

The large-scale production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis is hindered due to the higher overpotential required for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While commercial use of noble metal oxide OER catalysts suffer from poor stability and cost ineffectiveness, the development of non-noble metal-based OER catalysts is still a challenge to overcome. The compositional and structural flexibility of 3D perovskite oxides presents a distinct opportunity to design electrocatalysts that can overcome the kinetic sluggishness of OER and address its associated limitations. Herein, we have designed and synthesized a series of 3D perovskite catalysts, Ba3–xSrxMTiSbO9 (x = 1, 1.5 for Co and x = 2 for Mn/Co), by the conventional solid-state method. The Co analogues exhibit exceptional OER performance when compared with the manganese counterpart and a similar or comparable overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 (η10) but with a significantly lower overpotential at 100 mA/cm2 (η100) as compared to RuO2, benchmark electrocatalysts for OER. The Co compounds have also shown superior kinetics as compared to RuO2. The charge-transfer resistance across interfaces measured by operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at different potentials follow the activity order of the compounds. The higher electrocatalytic activity of Ba3–xSrxCoTiSbO9 originates from higher d-electron counts, close to unity filling of the eg-orbital electrons, structural factor, μ/t (μ = perovskite B-cation to O2– radius ratio and t = tolerance factor), and higher lattice oxygen participation. A plausible mechanism is also provided based on the pH-dependent OER study. The Co perovskite with the highest lattice oxygen participation and lowest μ/t exhibited the highest OER activity and fastest kinetics. The study demonstrates a nonconventional tool of A-cation manipulation in synthesizing non-noble metal-based 3D perovskites as efficient OER electrocatalysts despite the elusive nature of their active sites.

In this work, non-peripherally tetra 3-(4-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)phenoxy) substituted nickel(II) phthalocyanine (NiPc), cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc), zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc), copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and lead(II) phthalocyanine (PbPc) were synthesized. The structural characterization of the novel compounds was performed by a combination of instrumental methods. The electrochemical and in-situ spectroelectrochemical responses of the compounds were recorded and redox properties were illuminated. Graphitic carbon nitride(g-C3N4) was synthesized by thermal decomposition of urea and combined with metallophthalocyanines to avoid agglomeration of phthalocyanine, to obtain homogeneous microstructured catalyst and to provide synergistic effects between pyridinic N-metal bonds of g-C3N4 and metallophthalocyanines (MPcs). The synthesized compounds were electropolymerized onto g-C3N4 thanks to piperazin substitute groups. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of g-C3N4/Poly-MPcs was investigated in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). The g-C3N4/Poly-NiPc exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance with low overpotential and Tafel slope, respectively, 380 mV@ 10 mA cm−2 and 80 mVdec−1, which is superior to the g-C3N4. Moreover, g-C3N4/Poly-NiPc electrocatalyst exhibited ∼100 times higher current density than g-C3N4.

Noble metal electrocatalysts are highly preferred for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis cell (PEMWE) due to their exceptional catalytic activity and stability. This study proposes a novel thin electrode (NTE) design to enhance the performance of noble metal electrocatalysts for the OER in PEMWE. The NTE utilizes a thin porous transport layer for the direct deposition of Iridium (Ir). Unlike conventional gas diffusion electrodes with deep porous structures that underutilize the catalyst due to limited triple-phase boundary conditions, the flat NTEs with straight-through pores overcome this restriction. The paper compares two deposition methods, electroplating and sputter coating. The in-situ electrochemical properties of NTEs with varying Ir loadings (0.06–1.01 mg cm−2) are investigated. The electroplated NTE demonstrates excellent mass activity, achieving 5.05 A mg−1 at 1.6 V and 80 °C. The NTE exhibits a simple fabrication process and low cost while significantly improving catalyst mass activity. Additionally, the NTE reduces electrode thickness from hundreds of micrometers to only 25 μm. This concept holds great promise for the future advancement of compact and high-efficiency PEMWE electrodes, resulting in reduced cost, volume, and mass of both the electrode itself and the overall system.

Hydrogen has recently attracted a lot of attention as a clean as well as sustainable energy source. However, the vast bulk of industrial hydrogen is produced by converting natural gas into hydrogen. One of the primary goals of large-scale electrolysis is to find efficient, cost-effective, stable, and many other catalysts capable of producing hydrogen from water with minimal electrical bias. Using readily available electrocatalysts on Earth to facilitate the oxidation of water is one way to get closer to an effective method of splitting water to produce hydrogen. Here in the present work, CuWO4 was coated on the conducting polypyrrole (PPy) polymer via hydrothermal techniques to boost its catalytic performance. The fabricated PPy/CuWO4 composite is then utilized for water splitting to yield hydrogen in addition to oxygen. The PPy is able to raise the CuWO4 Fermi levels are separated, as a result, the PPy/CuWO4 produced a large number of strong and readily accessible charges, which led to the splitting of water into hydrogen, and demonstrated that at a potential of 1.470 V vs. RHE, the current density intended for CuWO4-3/PPY reached 10 mAcm−2, attaining an overpotential of 197 mV, with a Tafel plot slope of about 34.4 mVdec−1, and also with a charge transfer resistance of 2.3Ω for OER. Furthermore, the HER activity also attained lower overpotential (250 mV), with a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec−1 in order to reach a 10 mAcm−2 current density. In addition, the CuWO4 is completely encased by the PPy, facilitating charge transfer, allowing the particles to travel rapidly to the polymer's surface. Hence, this study demonstrates that the highly effective CuWO4-3/PPy nanocomposite is responsible for future energy-related applications.

This review aims to offer a comprehensive and insightful overview of the recent progress in the design of spinel‐type electrocatalysts for LOBs. This review exhaustively summarizes various modification strategies applied to spinel materials and emphasizes the influential role of catalytic descriptors in designing highly active spinel‐type catalysts.

Abstract Developing efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional electrocatalysts is attractive for rechargeable metal–air batteries. Meanwhile, single metal atoms embedded in 2D layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) have become a very promising catalyst. Recently, many attentions have been paid to the 2D ReS 2 electrocatalyst due to its unique distorted octahedral 1T’ crystal structure and thickness‐independent electronic properties. Here, the catalytic activity of different transition metal (TM) atoms embedded in ReS 2 using the density functional theory is investigated. The results indicate that TM@ReS 2 exhibits outstanding thermal stability, good electrical conductivity, and electron transfer for electrochemical reactions. And the Ir@ReS 2 and Pd@ReS 2 can be used as OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalysts with a lower overpotential for OER (η OER ) of 0.44 V and overpotentials for ORR (η ORR ) of 0.26 V and 0.27 V, respectively. The excellent catalytic activity is attributed to the optimal adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates coming from the effective modulation of the electronic structure of ReS 2 after Ir/Pd doping. The results can help to deeply understand the catalytic activity of TM@ReS 2 and develop novel and highly efficient OER/ORR electrocatalysts.

Electrochemical water‐splitting to produce hydrogen is potential to substitute the traditional industrial coal gasification, but the oxygen evolution kinetics at the anode remains sluggish. In this paper, sea urchin‐like Fe doped Ni3S2 catalyst growing on nickel foam (NF) substrate is constructed via a simple two‐step strategy, including surface iron activation and post sulfuration process. The NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2 obtains at temperature of 130 ℃ (NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130) features nanoneedle‐like arrays which are vertically grown on the particles to form sea urchin‐like morphology, features high electrochemical surface area. As oxygen evolution catalyst, NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130 exhibits excellent oxygen evolution activities, fast reaction kinetics, and superior reaction stability. The excellent OER performance of sea urchin‐like NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130 is mainly ascribed to the high‐vertically dispersive of nanoneedles and the existing Fe dopants, which obviously improved the reaction kinetics and the intrinsic catalytic properties. The simple preparation strategy is conducive to establish high‐electrochemical‐interface catalysts, which shows great potential in renewable energy conversion.

At this moment, non-aqueous rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) with extremely high energy density are regarded as the most viable energy storage devices to potentially replace petroleum. One of the most crucial impediments to their implementation has been ensuring facile oxygen availability. Moreover, as semi-sealed systems, LOBs have confronted challenges including oxygen impurities, product degradation, anode corrosion, frequent side reactions, and mediocre cycling performance. In this work, utilizing the physical adsorption of porous (micro-, meso- and macro-porous) solid carbon materials, we incorporate an oxygen storage layer (OSL) with reversible oxygen ad/desorption capabilities into a LOB to develop novel fully-sealed lithium-oxygen batteries (F-S-LOBs). The results demonstrate mesoporous carbons exhibit optimal oxygen adsorption/desorption kinetics, rendering them highly suitable for F-S-LOBs without developing complex oxygen-permeable membranes or carrying oxygen tanks. The OSL fabricated with mesoporous carbon can sustain battery charge/discharge at various current densities with exceptional cycling performance. Additionally, we provide approximate pore size guidelines for oxygen storage materials to aid future research. This study is anticipated to offer a new robust research direction for metal-air batteries and to forge a new path toward promoting the commercialization and development of this technology.

The advancement of extremely effective and long-lasting sustainable electrocatalysts developed from abundant earth elements is an emergence aspect in green energy generation. The greenly synthesised NCF-LDH has been shown that promising candidate for the OER process. Mechnochemical processes are often quick, inexpensive, and easily scalable to produce industrial quantities. In comparison with IrO2 (370 mV), the optimum NCF-LDH-X on GC electrode showed the modest required overpotential (240 mV) at 10 mA cm−2. Solar-assisted water oxidation at 1.57 V shows more expert efficacy of NCF-LDH-2 for solar to hydrogen generation. As an outcome, the greenly synthesised NCF-LDH outperformed the high-priced electrocatalysts. Consequently, low-cost industrial-scale H2 generation using commercial solar cells might be possible.

Understanding the function of individual elements in high-entropy perovskites is one of the critical issues for the design of inexpensive and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Here, we report our findings in boosting the electrochemical activity and durability of a high-entropy perovskite catalyst via sequential substitution of Sr2+ for the A-site elements. According to the Sr2+ localized tuned, the catalyst of (LaSmGdSrPr)0.2MnO3 has a half-wave potential of 0.786 V vs. RHE and an overpotential of 0.378 V and has better ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity than the Sr-free high-entropy perovskite catalyst (LaSmGdYPr)0.2MnO3.This is attributed to the local doping of Sr2+ activating the active center of the high-entropy perovskite catalyst (LaSmGdSrPr)0.2MnO3, modulating the adsorption energy of the oxygen-containing intermediates and the electronic structure of the transition metal at the B-site, which results in efficient oxygen electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the introduction of Sr2+ enhances the hybridization between Mn 2p and O 1 s and accelerates the adsorption and desorption kinetics of the intermediates, leading to both enhanced activity and durability of (LaSmGdSrPr)0.2MnO3. DFT theoretical calculations also demonstrate the key role played by Sr2+ in the high-entropy perovskite structure for the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity. This study provides new insights for designing high-entropy electrocatalysts for various potential applications.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical cathode reaction for hydrogen production from water splitting. However, due to the sluggish kinetics of OER, the water-splitting process is impeded. Thus, it is imperative to develop efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts that reduce the overpotential and improve the kinetics of OER. Herein, an in-situ synthesis strategy was applied to prepare the ionic liquid functionalized carbon nanotube (IL-CNT) that served as a metal-free electrocatalyst for OER. This powder material exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic activity for OER, with an overpotential of 335 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec-1. Then, it was found that catalytic activity was influenced by the IL anion. Moreover, this IL-CNT powder could self-assemble to form carbon film during preparation, exhibiting outstanding catalytic activity for OER (a low overpotential of 153 mV at 10 mA cm−2), which was highly beneficial for practical application. Based on the theoretical calculations and experimental results, these in-situ functionalization sites on CNT surface played a significant role in regulating their electron structure. This, in turn, promoted electron transfer and hydroxyl adsorption, resulting in a substantial increase in catalytic activity for the OER.

This work examines the cooperative effect between Zr doping and oxygen vacancy engineering in anodized TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) for enhanced oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Zr dopant and annealing conditions significantly affected the electrocatalytic characteristics of grown TNTs. Zr doping results in Zr4+ substituted for Ti4+ species, which indirectly creates oxygen vacancy donors that enhance charge transfer kinetics and reduce carrier recombination in TNT bulk. Moreover, oxygen vacancies promote the creation of unsaturated Ti3+(Zr3+) sites at the surface, which also boosts the ORR interfacial process. Annealing at reductive atmospheres (e.g., H2, vacuum) resulted in a larger increase in oxygen vacancies, which greatly enhanced the ORR activity. In comparison to bare TNTs, Zr doping and vacuum treatment (Zr:TNT–Vac) significantly improved the conductivity and activity of ORRs in alkaline media. The finding also provides selective hydrogen peroxide production by the electrochemical reduction of oxygen.

Persistent hypoxia in bone metastases induces an immunosuppressive environment, limiting the effectiveness of immunotherapies. To address chronic hypoxia, we have developed manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles with tunable oxygen production kinetics for sustained oxygenation in bone metastases lesions. Using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-stabilized MnO2 or poly(lactic[50]-co-glycolic[50] acid) (50:50 PLGA), poly(lactic[75]-co-glycolic[25] acid) (75:25 PLGA), and polylactic acid (PLA)-encapsulated MnO2 NPs, we demonstrate that polymer hydrophobicity attenuates burst oxygen production and enables tunable oxygen production kinetics. The PEG-MnO2 NPs resulted in rapid hypoxia reduction in spheroids, which was rapidly attenuated, while the PLA-MnO2 NPs exhibited delayed hypoxia control in cancer spheroids. The 50:50 PLGA-MnO2 NPs exhibited the best short- and long-term control of hypoxia in cancer spheroids, resulting in sustained regulation of the expression of HIF-1α and immunosuppressive genes. The sustained control of hypoxia by the 50:50 PLGA-MnO2 NPs enhanced the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells against cancer spheroids. In vivo, 50:50 PLGA-MnO2 showed greater accumulation in the long bones and pelvis, common sites for bone metastases. The NPs decreased hypoxia in bone metastases and decreased regulatory T cell levels, resulting in enhanced survival of mice with established bone metastases.

Water electrolysis is attracting increasing attention in becoming the main method for green energy production, which has long been hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and high cost of noble-metal (NM) containing electrodes. Template replication technique has been employed to fabricate porous CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy (HEA) bulk foams with > 95 % porosity. High entropy led to the formation of a single-phase solid solution of transition metals in the as-fabricated porous HEA bulk foam, and the lattice distortion brings about the outstanding OER performance that is close to that of the RuO2 reference sample. Effective electrochemically active surface area and amount of exposed active sites are increased by grinding into nanoparticles, which produced superior OER performance with a near-record low overpotential of ∼ 245 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm2, a low Tafel slope of 73.6 mV/dec, a double layer capacitance of 102.3 mF, and excellent long-term stability over 24 h. This work demonstrates a cost-effective way to fabricate NM-free HEA electrocatalyst with complex structure and excellent stability in OER, which could help in advancing the research for alkaline water electrolysis.

Multi‐principal element alloys (MPEAs) are gaining interest in corrosion and electrocatalysis research due to their electrochemical stability across a broad pH range and the design flexibility they offer. Using the equimolar CrCoNi alloy, we observe significant metal dissolution in a corrosive electrolyte (0.1 M NaCl, pH 2) concurrently with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the transpassive region despite the absence of hysteresis in polarization curves or other obvious corrosion indicators. We present a characterization scheme to delineate the contribution of OER and alloy dissolution, using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for OER‐onset detection, and quantitative chemical analysis with inductively coupled‐mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) and ultraviolet visible light (UV‐Vis) spectroscopy to elucidate metal dissolution processes. In‐situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC‐AFM) revealed that the transpassive metal dissolution on CrCoNi is dominated by intergranular corrosion. These results have significant implications for the stability of MPEAs in corrosion systems, emphasizing the necessity of analytically determining metal ions released from MPEA electrodes into the electrolyte when evaluating Faradaic efficiencies of OER catalysts. The release of transition metal ions not only reduces the Faradaic efficiency of electrolyzers but may also cause poisoning and degradation of membranes in electrochemical reactors.

Abstract Improving the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to realise energy systems based on water electrolysis. Many catalysts have been developed for the OER to date, with iridium‐based oxides being the most promising due to their relative stability towards corrosion in acidic electrolytes under oxidising potentials. In recent years, examples of catalysts adopting layered structures have been shown to have promising characteristics such as higher conductivity and higher electrochemically active surface area compared to highly crystalline metal oxides. Furthermore, such materials possess additional tuneable properties such as interlayer spacing, identity and concentration of the interlayer species, edge and interlayer active sites, and higher active surface area. Recent attention has focused on mono‐ and polymetallic lithium‐containing layered materials, where the presence of interlayer lithium cations, in situ delithiation processes and combinations of transition metal oxides result in enhanced catalytic properties towards OER. This review aims to provide a summary of the recent developments of such layered materials, in which lithium or other alkali metal ions occupy interlayer sites in oxides.

Abstract Hydroxides are the archetype of layered crystals with metal‐oxygen (M‐O) octahedron units, which have been widely investigated as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. However, the better crystallinity of hydroxide materials, the more perfect octahedral symmetry and atomic ordering, resulting in the less exposed metal sites and limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a glassy state hydroxide material featuring with short‐range order and long‐range disorder structure is developed to achieve high intrinsic activity for OER. Specifically, a rapid freezing point precipitation method is utilized to fabricate amorphous multi‐component hydroxide. Owing to the freezing‐point crystallization environment and chaotic M‐O (M = Ni/Fe/Co/Mn/Cr etc.) structures, the as‐fabricated NiFeCoMnCr hydroxide exhibit a highly‐disordered glassy structure, as‐confirmed by X‐ray/electron diffraction, enthalpic response, and pair distribution function analysis. The as‐achieved glassy‐state hydroxide materials display a low OER overpotential of 269 mV at 20 mA cm −2 with a small Tafel slope of 33.3 mV dec −1 , outperform the benchmark noble‐metal RuO 2 catalyst (341 mV, 84.9 mV dec −1 ) . Operando Raman and density functional theory studies reveal that the glassy state hydroxide converted into disordered active oxyhydroxide phase with optimized oxygen intermediates adsorption under low OER overpotentials, thus boosting the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity.

Active and stable oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are essential in increasing the efficiency of the water electrolyzers. The Ni2P/Fe(O)OH heterostructure nanoparticles are prepared via solvothermal phosphidization of Ni metal-organic frameworks (MOF) followed by immersing in Fe3+ aqueous solution. Characterizations reveal that the Ni2P/Fe(O)OH heterostructure nanoparticles are 12.83 nm in size averagely, and the heterointerface induces electron interactions between the Ni2P and Fe(O)OH phases. When used to catalyze OER in alkaline solutions, the Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/nickel foam (NF) is the most active and exhibits 240 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm-2 oxygen evolution (OER) current densities, which is significantly better than the Ni2P/NF. Lower apparent activation energy, charge transfer resistance, and Tafel slope, along with higher electron rate constant are observed at Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/NF, which suggests that the OER kinetics is more facile at the heterostructure surface. Both Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/NF and Ni2P/NF involve decoupled electron and proton transfer process, and higher degree of lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) participation is observed at Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/NF, which results from the increased acidity of the Ni3+ sites. Density functional theory calculations prove that the formation of heterostructure with Fe(O)OH alters the band structure and the OER intermediate adsorption energies, that lead to lower energy barrier in the rate-determining step. The Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/NF is also stable towards OER in alkaline solutions.

Abstract Designing robust and cost‐effective electrocatalysts for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in the field of water electrolysis. In this study, we introduce an electrochemical strategy to activate stainless steel (SS) electrodes for efficient OER. By cycling the SS electrode within a potential window that encompasses the Fe(II)↔Fe(III) process, we can greatly enhance its OER activity compared to using a potential window that excludes this redox reaction, decreasing the overpotential at current density of 100 mA cm −2 by 40 mV. Electrochemical characterization, Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectroscopy and operando Raman measurements demonstrated that the Fe leaching at the SS surface can be accelerated through a Fe → γ‐Fe 2 O 3 → Fe 3 O 4 or FeO → Fe 2+ (aq.) conversion process, leading to the sustained exposure of Cr and Ni species. While Cr leaching occurs during its oxidation process, Ni species display higher resistance to leaching and gradually accumulate on the SS surface in the form of OER‐active Fe‐incorporated NiOOH species. Furthermore, a potential‐pulse strategy was also introduced to regenerate the OER‐activity of 316‐type SS for stable OER, both in the three‐electrode configuration (without performance decay after 300 h at 350 mA cm −2 ) and in an alkaline water electrolyzer (ca. 30 mV cell voltage increase after accelerated stress test‐AST). The AST‐stabilized cell can still reach 1000 mA cm −2 and 4000 mA cm −2 at cell voltages of 1.69 V and 2.1 V, which makes it competitive with state‐of‐the‐art electrolyzers based on ion‐exchange‐membranes using Ir‐based anodes.

Nanotubes constructed from methylene-bridged cycloparaphenyleneas (MCPPs) are investigated using density functional theory. The dynamical stability is indicated by the real vibrational frequencies of the infrared spectra. MCPPs are semiconductors with an energy gap of ∼ 2.9 eV that significantly decreases in the finite nanotubes. This decrease is a result of the interactive molecular orbitals that are localized at the pentagonal rings linking MCPPs. The UV-vis spectra show that transitions from the highest occupied and neighbor orbitals to the lowest unoccupied orbital dominate the primary absorption peaks. Oxygen evolution reaction shows that all the reaction intermediates, HO, O, and HOO are adsorbed by the pentagonal active sites. The considered nanotubes show good catalytic performance but the best performance is observed in the wider nanotubes with an overpotential of 0.10 V. This remarkably low overpotential in addition to the abundant active sites makes finite nanotubes from MCPPs exceptional catalysts for oxygen evolution.

Electrochemical water splitting is a process that shows promise for the sustainable conversion, storage, and delivery of hydrogen energy. The support development of electrocatalysts that support hydrogen and oxygen evolution processes (HER/OER) without requiring precious metals and with superior activity and durability is crucial for the broad adoption of water electrolysis. Compared to the traditional powder-coated type, a freestanding electrode architecture exhibits superior stability and kinetics. In this study, the layered FeTe-PANI nanocomposite is designed for hydrogen generation. Various nanostructures of FeTe-PANI like nanorods and nanosheets by controllable expansion of surfactants such as hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) can be adjusted to agglomerations. The nanosheets combined with nanorods (FeTe-PANI) show remarkable electrocatalytic activity with 195 mV overpotentials at 10 mAcm−2 for OER. Additionally, FeTe-PANI employed in a 2-electrode electrolyzer as a cathodic electrode electrocatalyst in 1.0 Molar potassium hydroxide media, yields a cell voltage of 1.52 V at a current density of 10 mAcm−2 with a noteworthy 80 h sturdiness, making it an ideal electrocatalyst towards empirical deployment of water splitting electrolyzers.

Herein, we have synthesized silver zirconate using a co-precipitation method at room temperature. The synthesized Ag2ZrO3 (SZ) was then subjected to calcination at different temperatures (300 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C). The synthesized Ag2ZrO3 material was evaluated for its photocatalytic oxygen evolution, activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) ions, and antibacterial activity under visible light irradiation. Among the different samples, the SZ sample (Ag2ZrO3 synthesized at room temperature) exhibited the highest photocatalytic oxygen evolution rate (2175.02 μmolg-1h−1). This enhanced performance can be attributed to the higher surface area of SZ compared to the other samples. Furthermore, all four samples were tested for the photoactivation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) ions to assess their ability for the decontamination of organic pollutant. The SZ photocatalyst demonstrated complete degradation (100 %) of RhB dye (2.1 × 10-5 M) within 120 min of visible light irradiation in the presence of PMS. In contrast, without PMS, only 54.33 % degradation of RhB was recorded in 300 min. This result indicates that SZ effectively activates PMS ions for the degradation of organic pollutants. Additionally, SZ exhibited excellent bactericidal activity against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria, both in the dark and in the presence of visible light. The findings demonstrate the multifunctional properties of Ag2ZrO3, making it suitable for a wide range of environmental remediation applications.

NiO has attracted wide attention in the past decade as a cost-effective electrochemical catalyst for OER. However, its relatively poor performance and conductivity limit its commercial applications. Here, we highlight a unique ion irradiation method to enhance the catalytic activity of NiO. Benefiting from sulfate anchoring and the introduction of oxygen vacancies by He+ ion irradiation, the optimal catalyst (ir-S-NiO) exhibits an outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 269 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the fabricated Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) constructed by the ir-S-NiO is demonstrated to need a cell voltage of 1.72 V to reach a current density of 0.1 A cm−2 and shows remarkably long-term stability for 200 h without obvious attenuation at the current density of 0.5 A cm−2. This work provides a new method for the development of high-performance and stable OER electrocatalysts.
