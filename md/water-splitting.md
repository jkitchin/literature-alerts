This study aims to explore the n-FeO and p-α-Fe2O3 semiconductor nanoparticles in hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions and a combined full cell electrocatalyst system to electrolyze the water. We have observed a distinct electrocatalytic performance for both HER and OER by tuning the interplay between iron oxidation states Fe2+ and Fe3+ and utilizing phase-transformed iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs). The Fe2+ rich n-FeO NPs exhibited superior HER performance compared to p-α-Fe2O3 and Fe(OH)x NPs, which is attributed to the enhancement in n-type semiconducting nature under HER potential, facilitating the electron transfer for the reduction in H+ ions. In contrast, p-α-Fe2O3 NPs demonstrated excellent OER activity. An H-cell constructed using n-FeO||p-α-Fe2O3 NPs as cathode and anode achieved a cell voltage of 1.87 V at a current density of 50 mA/cm2. The cell exhibited remarkable stability after 30 h of activation and maintained the high current density of 100 mA/cm2 for 80 h with a negligible increase in cell voltage. This work highlights the semiconducting properties of n-FeO and p-α-Fe2O3 for the electrochemical water splitting system using the band bending phenomenon under the applied potential.

NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) are a type of catalyst known for their exceptional catalytic performance during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, citric acid was incorporated into the synthesis process of NiFe-LDH, resulting in the NiFe-LDH-CA catalyst with superior OER performance. The catalytic efficacy is evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), which demonstrates a significant reduction in the OER overpotential from 320 mV to 240 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm-2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) indicate that the distribution of nickel valence states showed no significant difference between two samples, yet the NiFe-LDH-CA has a significantly higher proportion of Fe3+ ions in its iron content. In-situ Raman spectroscopes reveal that Fe3+ broadens the redox potential of nickel and Pourbaix diagrams indicate that higher Fe3+ levels could facilitate the interaction with oxygen active sites. Based on the analysis of test data, we propose a hypothesis that the high proportion of Fe3+ in catalysts may accelerate the oxygen evolution process by modulating the redox potential of nickel and engaging with reactive oxygen species. This provides valuable insights into how to improve the reaction rate of nickel-based catalysts.

This study explores the influence of oxygen and nitrogen flow ratios on the microstructure and mechanical properties of AlCrTaTiZr high-entropy oxynitride films. Oxygen flow rates (0%–0.75%) were adjusted while maintaining a fixed nitrogen flow ratio (RN = 15%) to fabricate films with similar compositions. The results show that increasing oxygen flow enhanced hardness through solid solution strengthening and grain refinement, though excessive oxygen caused an amorphous structure and reduced hardness. After annealing at 900 °C, the hardness of all films was further increased. The film with a nitrogen flow ratio 40 times higher than oxygen exhibited the highest hardness of 21.8 GPa, along with superior mechanical performance. These findings highlight the potential of high-entropy oxynitride films for applications requiring high wear resistance and adhesion.

Abstract The replacement of oxygen evolution reactions with organic molecule oxidation reactions to enable energy‐efficient hydrogen production has been a subject of interest. However, further reducing reaction energy consumption and releasing hydrogen from organic molecules continue to pose significant challenges. Herein, a strategy is proposed to produce hydrogen and formic acid from formaldehyde using Ag/Co 3 O 4 interface catalysts at the anode. The key to improving the performance of Ag‐based catalysts for formaldehyde oxidation lies in the strong SMSI achieved through the well‐designed “spontaneous redox reaction” between Ag and Co 3 O 4 precursors. Nano‐sized Ag particles are uniformly dispersed on Co 3 O 4 nanosheets, and electron‐deficient Ag δ+ are formed by the SMSI between Ag and Co 3 O 4. Ag/Co 3 O 4 demonstrates exceptional formaldehyde oxidation activity at low potentials of 0.32 V versus RHE and 0.65 V versus RHE, achieving current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm −2 , respectively. The electrolyzer “Ag/Co 3 O 4 ||20% Pt/C” achieves over 195% hydrogen efficiency and over 98% formic acid selectivity, maintaining stable operation for 60 hours. This work not only presents a novel approach to precisely modulate Ag particle size and interface electronic structure via SMSI, but also provides a promising approach to efficient and energy‐saving hydrogen production and the transformation of harmful formaldehyde.    

    

## The fate of nitrogen in deep magma oceans

Nitrogen is important in planetary evolution because it is essential to life and the most abundant element in Earth’s atmosphere. Here, we investigate how core formation affects the distribution of N within accreting terrestrial planets. We conducted laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments (LH-DAC) over a wide range of high pressure-temperature-compositional (PTX) conditions (38-103 GPa, 2728-5609 K, -1.95 to -1.03 ∆IW, 0.5-3.7 NBO/T) to study nitrogen partitioning in metal-silicate systems. Combining our data with existing low and high PT results, we developed a nitrogen partitioning model applicable from early accretion to extreme PT stages associated with giant impacts. We test the robustness of our model by accurately predicting nitrogen partitioning in a multi-anvil experiment conducted independently at 15 GPa, 2573 K with oxygen fugacity of -2.5 ∆IW. Our model shows that increasing pressure, oxygen fugacity, and N concentration in the alloy make nitrogen more siderophile, while increasing temperature, oxygen and silicon contents in the alloy, and the SiO2 content of the silicate melt make nitrogen less siderophile. Application of our model to core formation conditions under oxidized and reduced scenarios suggest that nitrogen can be siderophile or lithophile under low PT conditions but exhibits a neutral partitioning at high PT conditions (&gt; 100 GPa, 5000 K) over a wide range of bulk planet compositions. Using our model, along with partitioning models for S and C, we examine how core formation scenarios can fractionate C/N and S/N ratios in the BSE. Our model suggests that backreaction of volatile rich cores from reduced, smaller impactors (sub-Mars-sized) within deep magma oceans can impart a wide range of C/N and S/N ratios on the magma ocean. We find that the amount of silicate entrainment has a strong control on elemental fractionations imparted to the magma oceans. Elevated C/N and S/N ratios are associated with larger degrees of silicate entrainment, and vice versa. Thus, Earth’s apparent depletion of N may relate to its volatiles being reprocessed within deep magma oceans, possibly during the end stages of accretion.
