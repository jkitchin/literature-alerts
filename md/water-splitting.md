Assembling a heterostructure is an effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of hybrid materials. Herein, CoFe-layered double hydroxide and Co-metal–organic framework (CoFe-LDH/Co-MOF) hollow heterostructure nanorod arrays are synthesized. First, [Co(DIPL)(H3BTC)(H2O)2]n [named as Co-MOF, DIPL = 2,6-di(pyrid-4-yl)-4-phenylpyridine, H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid] crystalline materials with a uniform hollow structure were prepared on the nickel foam. The CoFe-LDH/Co-MOF composite perfectly inherits the original hollow nanorod array morphology after the subsequent electrodeposition process. Optimized CoFe-LDH/Co-MOF hollow heterostructure nanorod arrays display excellent performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with ultralow overpotentials of 215 mV to deliver current densities of 10 mA cm–2 and maintain the electrocatalytic activity for a duration as long as 220 h, ranking it one of the non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for OER. Density functional theory calculations validate the reduction in free energy for the rate-determining step by the synergistic effect of Co-MOF and CoFe-LDH, with the increased charge density and noticeable electron transfer at the Co–O site, which highlights the capability of Co-MOF to finely adjust the electronic structure and facilitate the creation of active sites. This work establishes an experimental and theoretical basis for promoting efficient water splitting through the design of heterostructures in catalysts.

Dual-metal single-atom catalysts with heteronuclear active sites exhibit superior oxygen catalysis performance than their single-atom counterparts, facilitating the practical applications in advanced electrochemical energy devices. Herein, a Fe-Cu dual-metal single-atom catalyst with Fe-N6 and Cu-N1S2 coordination environment (FeCu-DSAs/NSC) is reported. Due to the synergism of bimetallic active sites and asymmetric heteroatom coordination, the resultant FeCu-DSAs/NSC displays better bifunctional catalytic performance (a small potential gap between the Eη10 and E1/2, ΔE=0.647 V) when compared with the counterparts (Pt/C+IrO2 and Cu-ISAs/NSC), as well as surpassing most of bifunctional metal atom-based catalysts reported to date. As expected, FeCu-DSAs/NSC based rechargeable zinc-air battery shows remarkable superiority than commercial Pt/C+IrO2 benchmark, resulting in a high peak power density (230.66 mW cm−2), open-circuit voltage (1.464 V) and long-term cycling stability (up to 350 h at 10 mA cm−2).

The design of implantable biomaterials involves precise tuning of surface features because the early cellular fate on such engineered surfaces is highly influenced by many physicochemical factors [roughness, hydrophilicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsiveness, etc.]. Herein, to enhance soft tissue integration for successful implantation, Ti substrates decorated with uniform layers of nanoceria (Ce), called Ti@Ce, were optimally developed by a simple and cost-effective in situ immersion coating technique. The characterization of Ti@Ce shows a uniform Ce distribution with enhanced roughness (∼3-fold increase) and hydrophilicity (∼4-fold increase) and adopted ROS-scavenging capacity by nanoceria coating. When human gingival fibroblasts were seeded on Ti@Ce under oxidative stress conditions, Ti@Ce supported cellular adhesion, spreading, and survivability by its cellular ROS-scavenging capacity. Mechanistically, the unique nanocoating resulted in higher expression of amphiphysin (a nanotopology sensor), paxillin (a focal adhesion protein), and cell adhesive proteins (collagen-1 and fibronectin). Ti@Ce also led to global chromatin condensation by decreasing histone 3 acetylation as an early differentiation feature. Transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing confirmed the chromatin remodeling, antiapoptosis, antioxidant, cell adhesion, and TGF-β signaling-related gene signatures in Ti@Ce. As key fibroblast transcription (co)factors, Ti@Ce promotes serum response factor and MRTF-α nucleus localization. Considering all of this, it is proposed that the surface engineering approach using Ce could improve the biological properties of Ti implants, supporting their functioning at soft tissue interfaces and utilization as a bioactive implant for clinical conditions such as peri-implantitis.

Abstract While surface defects and heteroatom doping exhibit promising potential in augmenting the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their performance remains unable to rival that of the costly Pt‐based catalysts. Yet, the concurrent modification of catalysts by integrating both approaches stands as a promising strategy to effectively address the aforementioned limitation. In this work, tungsten dopants are introduced into self‐supported CoFe‐layered double hydroxides (LDH) on nickel foam using a hydrothermal method, and oxygen vacancies (Ov) are further introduced through calcination. The analysis results demonstrated that tungsten doping reduces the Ov formation energy of CoFeW‐LDH. The Ov acted as oxophilic sites, facilitating water adsorption and dissociation, and reducing the barrier for cleaving HO─H bonds from 0.64 to 0.14 eV. Additionally, Ov regulated the electronic structure of CoFeW‐LDH to endow optimized hydrogen binding ability on tungsten atoms, thereby accelerating alkaline Volmer and Heyrovsky reaction kinetics. Specifically, the abundance of Ov induced a transition of tungsten from a six‐coordinated to highly active four‐coordinated structure, which becomes the active site for HER. Consequently, an ultra‐low overpotential of 41 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , and a low Tafel slope of 35 mV dec −1 are achieved. These findings offer crucial insights for the design of efficient HER electrocatalysts.

It is challenging to synthesize oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts that are highly efficient, affordable, and stable for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. To address this challenge, we developed a low platinum-loading (only 6.68% wt) ORR catalyst (PtCu1-NC), comprising CuPt nanoparticles (average size: 1.51 nm) supported on the N-doped carbon substrates. PtCu1-NC possesses a high specific surface area of 662 m2 g–1 and a hierarchical porous structure, facilitating efficient mass transfer. The synergistic effect from introduced copper and the electron effect from nitrogen modify the electronic structure of platinum, effectively accelerating the ORR reaction and enhancing stability. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the catalytic mechanism and further verify the synergistic effect. Electrochemical assessments indicate that PtCu1-NC exhibits specific activity and mass activity 5.3 and 5.6 times higher, respectively, than commercial Pt/C. The half-wave potential is 27 mV more positive than that of commercial Pt/C. The electrochemical active surface area value is 104.3 m2 g–1, surpassing that of Pt/C. Approximately 78% of current is retained after 10,000 s chronoamperometry measurement. These results highlight the effectiveness of alloying in improving the catalyst performance.

Hydrogen energy as the alternative to fossil fuel received wide attention. Among different methods of hydrogen production, water electrolysis is the cleanest and most promising method. However, its development is greatly limited by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop low-cost, high activity, and good stability of non-precious metal catalyst to replace the precious metal catalyst (Pt, RuO2), and to further reduce overpotential and power consumption. To date, great efforts have been made to develop transition metal compounds with electrocatalytic performance, such as sulfides, oxides, and carbides materials. Especially, transition metal sulfides play a very important role as catalysts and have attracted wide attention for their structural adjustability, high abundance, and mild preparation process. In this introduction, we focus on the role of transition metal sulfides in catalysts for water electrolysis, especially in a few most studied sulfides such as cobalt/molybdenum based sulfides and the recently reported homogeneous cobalt-molybdenum based sulfides, in which cobalt acts as a key element. Composition, morphology, and size are the most important factors that influence the intrinsic activity, electrical conductivity, and electronic structure of these transition metal sulfides. Besides, the effect of carbon nanomaterials as carrier materials is also discussed. The aim of this review is to emphasize the great potentials of cobalt and molybdenum based sulfides with high performance, and to help improve the performance of existing sulfides and explore new modification methods.

Water films on minerals under humid environment can be photocatalytic hotspots when exposed to sunlight or artificial sources of ultraviolet (and visible) radiation. In this study, we resolved the water film-mediated photocatalysis on a model system of oxalate and TiO2 by in situ infrared spectroscopy. We find that 0.5 to 4 monolayer- (ML) thick water films enhanced photodecomposition rates of oxalate under 21 kPa O2 through the combination of direct hole transfer, ligand-to-metal-charge transfer and the production of hydroxyl radical and reactive oxygen species. Rates were, however, substantially slower in the absence of O2 because charge recombination, together with water film-mediated charge localization, disrupted hole transfer and hydroxyl radical production. Our work adds insight into the impact of humidity on controlling important photocatalytic processes in nature (drying soils, atmospheric aerosols), and technology (water and air treatment).

Recently, surface reconstruction derived from Ir-based derivatives could achieve satisfactory oxygen evolution performance. Herein, ultra-long nanowire hollandite structured Rb0.17IrO2 was synthesized and a nano-amorphous layer with a thickness of ∼1.5 nm was achieved by interfacial oxidation treatment. The prepared catalyst exhibits outstanding water oxidation activity with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 330 mV for robust continuous operation in acidic media. Through the spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the nano-amorphous layers induced by interfacial oxidation on the one-dimensional (1D)-nanowire surface have enhanced O-2p centers and increased Ir-O hybridization compared to the bulk Rb0.17IrO2 phase, which essentially balances the adsorption energy of the intermediates. Effectively incorporating surface reconstruction behavior could significantly improve catalyst activity. This work effectively combines 1D Ir-based materials and surface reconstruction, which provides a strategy for the subsequent full utilization of Ir-based materials applied on OER process.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential for the development of excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts, which are key functions in clean energy production. The emphasis of this study lies in the rapid design and investigation of 153 MN4–graphene (Gra)/ MXene (M2NO) electrocatalysts for ORR/OER catalytic activity using machine learning (ML) and density functional theory (DFT). The DFT results indicated that CoN4–Gra/Ti2NO had both good ORR (0.37 V) and OER (0.30 V) overpotentials, while TiN4–Gra/M2NO and MN4–Gra/Cr2NO had high overpotentials. Our research further indicated orbital spin polarization and d-band centers far from the Fermi energy level, affecting the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and thus reducing the catalytic activity. The ML results showed that the gradient boosting regression (GBR) model successfully predicted the overpotentials of the monofunctional catalysts RhN4–Gra/Ti2NO (ORR, 0.39 V) and RuN4–Gra/W2NO (OER, 0.45 V) as well as the overpotentials of the bifunctional catalyst RuN4–Gra/W2NO (ORR, 0.39 V; OER, 0.45 V). The symbolic regression (SR) algorithm was used to construct the overpotential descriptors without environmental variable features to accelerate the catalyst screening and shorten the trial-and-error costs from the source, providing a reliable theoretical basis for the experimental synthesis of MXene heterostructures.

Developing efficient and robust noble-metal-free electrocatalysts capable of catalyzing water oxidation in acidic media is highly desirable for producing H2 while it remains a great challenge. Herein, a self-supported MnOx/MnN0.84/Mn electrode with a sandwich-like configuration was prepared by consecutive steps involving a nitridation treatment and an in situ electrochemical activation process. The electrode requires overpotentials of ca. 475 and 571 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm–2, respectively, for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M H2SO4. More impressively, the electrode remains stable for over 300 h of continuous operation at a current density of 100 mA cm–2, which is, as far as we know, among the best values reported for Mn-based materials in the field of acidic water electrolysis. It is found that the metallic MnN0.84 layer is not only the precursor for the formation of MnOx nanosheet electrocatalysts as the actual catalyst for the OER but also enables efficient charge transfer between the active sites at the surface and the substrate. Moreover, the anticorrosive MnN0.84 interlayer that acts as the binder between the Mn substrate and the MnOx catalyst can protect the Mn substrate from corrosion in acidic electrolytes, highlighting the importance of interlayer modification in stabilizing electrocatalysts in harsh reaction conditions.

The development of advanced electrolysis technologies such as anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is central to the vision of a sustainable energy future. Key to the realization of such AEMWE technology lies in the exploration of low‐cost and high‐efficient catalysts for facilitating the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite tremendous efforts in the fundamental research, most of today’s OER works are conducted under room temperature, which deviates significantly with AEMWE’s operating temperature (50–80 °C). To bridge this gap, it is highly desirable to obtain insights into the OER catalytic behavior at elevated temperatures. Herein, using the well‐known perovskite catalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) as a proof of concept, the effect of temperature on the variation in OER catalytic activity and stability is evaluated. It is found that the BSCF’s activity increases with increasing temperature due to enhanced lattice oxygen participation promoting the lattice oxygen‐mediated OER process. Further, surface amorphization and cation leaching of BSCF become more pronounced as temperature increases, causing a somewhat attenuated OER stability. These new understandings of the fundamental OER catalysis over perovskite materials at industrial‐relevant temperature conditions are expected to have strong implications for the research of OER catalysts to be deployed in practical water electrolyzers.

Nitrogen doped leather waste-derived carbon materials have been employed as eletrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. Low current densities and complex synthesis routes of other carbon-based materials limit their practical applicability. We present herein a simple and cost-competitive design of a metal free nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NCM). At 10 mA cm−2 of current density, the assembled NCM showed a low over potential of 330 mV. NCM provided 73 mV dec-1 of slope value according to Tafel analysis, with NCM slope value improved as compared to previously described electrocatalysts inclusive of graphene (113 mV dec−1) and carbon nanosheets (101 mV dec−1), under similar reaction conditions. Linear sweep voltamogram, stability test and electrochemical impedance spectra confirmed the potential of NCM in OER as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst.

Trimetallic catalysts exhibit potential for functional complementarity and synergistic interactions, rendering them promising for catalyzing reactions involving multi-intermediates. However, achieving a uniform dispersion of all three metal species at the single-atom level continues to pose a significant challenge. In this work, a metal encapsulation-interlayer stacking strategy is developed to prepare FeCoNi@NC triple single-atom catalysts. Benefiting from the synergistic interplay among the M-NX (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) active sites, the FeCoNi@NC TACs demonstrate superior bifunctional catalytic efficacy in alkaline solutions, with a half-wave potential reaching 0.878 V (vs. RHE) and a minimal overpotential of 285 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable ORR performance in acidic environments, achieving a half-wave potential of 0.814 V (vs. RHE). DFT calculations elucidate that an elevated d-band center enhances the adsorption of reactive intermediates at the Fe-N4 and Co-N4 sites, consequently augmenting ORR and OER activities. This study delineates a direct and effective methodology for the synthesis of high-performance and durable trimetallic single atom MNC ORR/OER catalysts for Zn-air batteries.

Abstract The discovery of non‐precious catalysts for replacing the precious metal of ruthenium in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a key step in reducing the cost of green hydrogen production. The 2D d ‐MHOFs, a new 2D materials with controllable oxygen vacancies formed by controlling the degree of coordination bridging between metal hydroxyl oxide and BDC ligands are synthesized at room temperature, exhibit excellent OER properties with low overpotentials of 207 mV at 10 mA cm −2 . High‐resolution transmission electron microscopy images and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the introduction of oxygen vacancy sites leads to a lattice distortion and charge redistribution in the catalysts, enhancing the OER activity of 2D d ‐MHOFs comprehensively. Synchrotron radiation and in situ Raman/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that part of oxygen defect sites on the surface of 2D d ‐MHOFs are prone to transition to highly active metal hydroxyl oxides during the OER process. This work provides a mild strategy for scalable preparation of 2D d ‐MHOFs nanosheets with controllable oxygen defects, reveals the relationship between oxygen vacancies and OER performance, and offers a profound insight into the basic process of structural transformation in the OER process.

Water electrolysis driven by “green electricity“ is an ideal technology to realize energy conversion and store renewable energy into hydrogen. With the development of proton exchange membrane (PEM), water electrolysis in acidic media suitable for many situations with an outstanding advantage of high gas purity has attracted significant attention. Compared with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kinetic sluggish process that needs a higher overpotential. Especially in acidic media, OER process poses higher requirements for the electrocatalysts, such as high efficiency, high stability and low costs. This review focuses on the acidic OER electrocatalysis, reaction mechanisms, and critical parameters used to evaluate performance. Especially the modification strategies applied in the design and construction of new‐type electrocatalysts are also summarized. The characteristics of traditional noble metal‐based electrocatalysts and the noble metal‐free electrocatalysts developed in recent decades are compared and discussed. Finally, the current challenges for the most promising acidic OER electrocatalysts are presented, together with a perspective for future water electrolysis.

Surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts is an effective strategy to modulate the space charge distribution to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. The p-n heterostructured FeP/CoP-2D octagonal nanoplates were successfully constructed by cation-exchange method. The space charge effect caused by the p-n heterojunction accelerated the electron transfer, optimized the electronic structure, and improved the activity of the active sites during the oxygen evolution reaction process. As a result, FeP/CoP-2D required only 247 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope as low as 68 mV dec-1. Density-functional theory calculations confirmed that the construction of p-n heterojunctions can enhance the adsorption of *OH in the active centers and optimize the Gibbs free energy of the OER reaction. This study provides an effective and feasible strategy for constructing p-n heterojunctions to modulate the space charge state for optimizing the OER performance of electrocatalysts.

Electrocatalysts with high activity and long-term durability are vital toward large-scale hydrogen production from electrocatalytic water splitting. Here, the self-supported electrode (FeOxHy@Ni3B/NF) with hierarchical heterostructure was simply prepared by using Ni3B chunks grown on nickel foam as substrate to in situ form vertical FeOxHy nanosheets. Such hybrid shows efficient oxygen evolution reaction activity with overpotentials as low as 267 and 249 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution and 30 wt% KOH solution, respectively. Meanwhile, it also exhibits excellent catalytic stability, sustaining catalysis at 500 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution for 200 h, and even for 200 h at 1000 mA cm−2 in 30 wt% KOH solution. Further experimental results reveal that the FeOxHy@Ni3B/NF is endowed with superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface properties, which not only provide more mass transport channels, as well as facilitated the diffusion of reaction intermediates and gas bubbles. Also, it holds faster reaction kinetics, more accessible active sites and accelerated electron transfer rates due to strong synergistic interactions at the heterogeneous interface.

Abstract Merely all transition‐metal‐based materials reconstruct into similar oxyhydroxides during the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), severely limiting the options for a tailored OER catalyst design. In such reconstructions, initial constituent p‐block elements take a sacrificial role and leach into the electrolyte as oxyanions, thereby losing the ability to tune the catalyst's properties systematically. From a thermodynamic point of view, indium is expected to behave differently and should remain in the solid phase under alkaline OER conditions. However, the structural behavior of transition metal indium phases during the OER remains unexplored. Herein, are synthesized intermetallic cobalt indium (CoIn 3 ) nanoparticles and revealed by in situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission microscopy that they undergo phase segregation to cobalt oxyhydroxide and indium hydroxide. The obtained cobalt oxyhydroxide outperforms a metallic‐cobalt‐derived one due to more accessible active sites. The observed phase segregation shows that indium behaves distinctively differently from most p‐block elements and remains at the electrode surface, where it can form lasting interfaces with the active metal oxo phases.
