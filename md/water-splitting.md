The electrochemical performances of an oxygen-evolving anode produced by the reactivation of waste Ti substrate by a typical IrO2-Ta2O5 coating are correlated to the textural (non)uniformities of the coating and its exhaustion state. Coating degradation is considered operational loss of the activity in a metal electrowinning process. It was found that (pseudo)capacitive performances can vary over the coating surface by 20–30% and depend on the type of dynamics of the input perturbation: constant through cyclic voltammetry (CV) or discontinuous time-dependent through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CV-EIS data correlation enabled profiling of the capacitive properties through the depth of a coating and over its surface. The correlation was confirmed by the findings for the analysis of coating activity for an oxygen evolution reaction, finally resulting in the reliable proposition of a mechanism for the operational loss of the anode. It was found that the less compact and thicker coating parts performed better and operated more efficiently, especially at lower operational current densities.

Abstract Constructing metal alloys/metal oxides heterostructured electrocatalysts with abundant and strongly coupling interfaces is vital yet challenging for practical electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, CoRu nanoalloys uniformly anchored on CoMoO 4 nanosheet heterostructured electrocatalyst (CoRu‐CoMoO 4 /NF) are synthesized via a self‐templated strategy by simply annealing of Ru‐etched CoMoO 4 /NF precursor in a reduction atmosphere. The dense and robustly coupled interface not only provides abundant active sites for water splitting but also strengthens the charge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the theoretical calculations unveil that the strong electronic interaction at CoRu‐CoMoO 4 interface can induce an interfacial electron redistribution and reduce the energetic barriers for the hydrogen and oxygen intermediates, thereby accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. The resultant catalyst only requires the overpotentials of 49 mV for HER and 209 mV for OER at 10 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the constructed CoRu‐CoMoO 4 ||CoRu‐CoMoO 4 two‐electrode cell achieves a cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm −2 , outperforming the benchmark Pt/C||IrO 2 . This work explores an avenue for the rational design of heterostructured electrocatalysts with abundant interfaces for practical water‐splitting electrocatalysis.

Abstract The covalency of the metal─oxygen (M─O) bond is significantly amplified in the transition metal sites with elevated oxidation states, thereby enabling the lattice oxygen‐mediated mechanism (LOM) to transcend the traditional linear scaling limitations of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, an innovative surface atom release speed‐mediated doping of Mo atoms in NiFe (oxy)hydroxides by controlled dissolution of Mo atoms from the Mo 2 N surface, which resulted in the formation of NiFeMo(OH) 2 with high valence Ni species for OER. Structural characterizations, coupled with in situ Raman and theoretical calculations, elucidate that the incorporation of Mo in NiFeMo(OH) 2 modulates the electronic configuration of the metal centers, thereby diminishing the formation energy of Ni 3+/4+ species. This modulation augments the M─O bond covalency, facilitating a shift in the OER pathway from the conventional absorbate evolution mechanism to the more efficient LOM. Consequently, the NiFeMo(OH) 2 displays a low overpotential of 236 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , along with long stability (>500 h) at 50 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, when integrated into an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it achieves a current density of 1.0 A cm −2 at a cell voltage of merely 2.27 V, underscoring its potential for practical applications.

Abstract While considerable efforts have been devoted to developing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in recent years, studies related to the investigation of the true catalytically active species for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain lacking in the field. In this work, the active species of a cobalt‐functionalized COF (TpBpy‐Co) is studied as electrochemical OER catalyst through a series of electrochemical measurements and post‐electrolysis characterizations. These results suggest that cobalt oxide‐based nanoparticles are formed in TpBpy‐Co from Co(II) ions coordinated to the COF backbone when exposing TpBpy‐Co to alkaline media, and these newly formed nanoparticles serve as the primary active species for oxygen evolution. The study thus emphasizes that caution is warranted when assessing the catalytic activity of COF electrocatalysts, as the pristine COF may act as the pre‐catalyst, with the active species forming only under catalyst operating conditions. Specifically, strong coordination between COFs and metal centers under electrochemical operation conditions is crucial to avoid unintended transformation of COF electrocatalysts. This work thus contributes to the rational development of earth‐abundant COF OER catalysts for the production of green hydrogen from renewable resources.

Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key for clean energy applications such as rechargeable metal‐air batteries. Highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts have been the focus of great attention by scientists. Here, an innovative and continuous growth method is established to fabricate integrated Janus structure Co3O4/CoNGDY catalyst, which can work for bifunctional oxygen catalytic conversion, achieving highly durable zinc‐air batteries. Embedded in the hydrangea‐shaped N‐doped graphdiyne (NGDY), the Co3O4/CoNGDY is self‐organized by CoNGDY at the NGDY contact sites and Co3O4 at the upper part, in which Co3O4 works as OER catalyst and CoNGDY acts as ORR catalyst. Due to the incomplete charge transfer within integrated structure, NGDY reduces the d‐band center of the Co sites, so the adsorption strength of intermediates is balanced, and the catalytic activity for ORR/OER is increased. The Co3O4/CoNGDY can serve as an efficient air electrode of rechargeable zinc‐air batteries. The rechargeable Co3O4/CoNGDY‐based aqueous zinc‐air batteries demonstrate excellent performance with a high specific capacity of 746.8 mAh g−1 and an extremely long lifetime of more than 5000 hours. The recoverable modularized cylindrical Co3O4/CoNGDY‐based solid‐state zinc‐air batteries with a power density of up to 167.6 mW cm−2 can be achieved.

Developing a low‐cost, robust, and high‐performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine‐linked isoindigo‐based covalent organic networks. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar 2D‐nanosheets covalent organic framework (I‐TTA COF), whereas its combination with ionic non‐planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (I‐TG COP) with a fibrous morphology. The sheet‐like crystalline I‐TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I‐TG COP. I‐TTA exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of ~134 mV for HER (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and ~283 mV for OER (in 1 M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I‐TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal‐free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24 hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. However, its performance is often hindered by low selectivity and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report an anthrazoline‐based supramolecular photocatalyst, SA‐SADF‐H+, featuring an unsymmetric protonation structure for H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air. The introduction of unsymmetric protonation disrupts the initial mirror symmetry of SADF, significantly enhancing the molecular dipole and facilitating efficient charge separation and electron transfer. Additionally, this modification increases the hydrophilicity of SA‐SADF‐H+, enabling the interaction of water and dissolved oxygen with the catalytic sites. The altered electron density distribution creates numerous dual active sites for Yeager‐type O2 adsorption, facilitating an efficient ORR towards H2O2 via a direct one‐step two‐electron pathway. Notably, SA‐SADF‐H+ achieves an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production at a rate of 4667 μmol L‐1 h‐1, with a remarkable solar‐to‐chemical conversion (SCC) of 1.35%, surpassing most organic photocatalytic systems. Furthermore, SA‐SADF‐H+ demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic antibacterial activity, achieving 100% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus within 60 min.

The development of efficient and stable photoelectrodes is essential for the advancement of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water‐splitting technologies, which hold promise for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER), necessary for sustainable hydrogen production. In this study, the synthesis of a ternary composite, In2S3/FeVO4/CNT has been reported, designed for highly efficient PEC oxygen evolution. The formation of In2S3/FeVO4 heterostructure enhances PEC performance significantly due to the type‐II band alignment, which minimizes electron‐hole recombination and improves charge separation The addition of CNTs further enhances performance by providing conductive pathways that improve electron transport and reduce charge transfer resistance. The resulting In2S3/FeVO4/CNT ternary composite achieves a current density of 14.70 mAcm−2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE, representing a notable increase in performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the ternary composite has the lowest charge transfer resistance, while Bode phase analysis indicates a longer carrier lifetime, emphasizing the synergistic effect of heterostructure formation and CNT inclusion. The ternary composite also demonstrates excellent stability and responsiveness during transient photocurrent cycling, maintaining performance under repeated illumination, making it a strong candidate for water‐splitting applications driven by visible light.

The coupling of lattice and heterostructure interfaces represents an effective strategy for disrupting the so-called scalar relationship and accelerating reactions involving multiple intermediates. In view of this, a lattice-heterostructure interfacial catalyst consisting of a crystalline Fe/Ni bimetallic MOF and amorphous Fe-MOF was designed in this paper for high-performance alkaline oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. The strongly coupled lattice-heterostructure interface induces a unique synergistic effect that promotes electron transfer of the catalyst. The resulting catalyst exhibits exceptionally high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media, the

It is crucial to utilize extremely efficient and economical catalysts for the energy-intensive and kinetically slow oxygen evolution process. Here, we fabricated a NiFeLDH coupled with the NiFe-MOF catalyst with a unique hierarchical structure using a facile and rapid electrodeposition and electrochemical activation strategy. With a low overpotential of about 187 mV at 10 mA cm–2, the NiFeLDH/NiFe-MOF/NF demonstrates exceptional stability for more than 1000 h. Additionally, the produced NiFeLDH/NiFe-MOF/NF could provide high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm–2 in 6 M KOH at relatively low overpotentials of 293 and 353 mV, respectively. The construction of heterojunctions provides abundant interfacial active sites and optimizes catalytic activity by adjusting the surface electronic structure and energy levels. This serves to enhance the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further prove that the construction of NiFeLDH regulates the band structure of metal sites, enhances the catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and lowers the intermediate medium's adsorption free energy.

The synthesis of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts that markedly reduce the overpotential over an extended period is crucial for electrolytic water splitting toward hydrogen production. A kind of Ni/Fe fluoride (hydroxide) nanocomposite OER catalyst is designed and prepared by a two‐step method for the first time. The nanocomposite with the optimal OER performance (Ni:Fe precursor ratio of 9:1) is observed to possess a nanoparticle morphology with size of about 100 nm. Each nanoparticle hosts extensive nanoregions of Ni4OHF7, NiFeF5∙2H2O and Fe1.9F4.75∙0.95H2O phases. The optimal nanocomposite (Ni:Fe precursor ratio of 9:1) exhibits OER overpotential of merely 208 mV and 349 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and 100 mA cm‐2 respectively, tafel slope of 53.1, and outstanding stability for 10 h duration at 100 mA cm‐2. The superior OER catalytic performance of the optimal nanocomposite after CV activation is mainly ascribed to the comprehensive catalytic effect of multiple Ni, Fe active sites from three phases, the smaller charge transfer resistance achieved at this particular Ni:Fe precursor ratio. The abundant resources of Ni, Fe, F elements and the superior OER properties of the Ni/Fe fluorides (hydroxide) nanocomposite, makes it a good OER catalyst candidate for electrolytic water splitting toward hydrogen production.

Abstract The development of cost‐effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical and challenging in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting for industrial applications. Herein, a series of cations (Fe, Ni, and Zn)‐doped Co‐based borophosphates with an anion skeleton (Na 2 CoB 3 P 2 O 11 (OH)· n H 2 O are prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, in which the cation dopants could be easily achieved via a simple cation exchange during the hydrothermal reaction process. Especially, the Fe dopant increases active sites, improves charge‐mass transfer, and tunes the electronic structures of the Co‐based borophosphate electrode. The optimal Fe‐doped NaCBPO (NaC 3 FBPO), with the cobalt to iron molar ratio of 3, shows a low overpotential of 289 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and it can be stable for 16 h at this current density. Above all, it has a fast reaction rate with a low Tafel slope of 84.25 mV·dec −1 . This work provides a promising transition metal‐based borophosphates materials with high efficiency and durability toward water splitting.

The edges of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) display an exceptionally efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity than the (001) basal plane as demonstrated by both theoretical calculations and experimental studies. However, a controllable synthesis method of LDHs with abundant edges has yet to be described. Herein, we report a strategy enabling the synthesis of nickel‐iron LDHs with abundant edges (NiFe LDHs‐E) based on the use of citrate anions as the structure‐directing agent. The edge density is characterized using spectroscopy techniques and its OER performance is compared with that of nickel‐iron LDHs with abundant basal planes (NiFe LDHs‐B). In alkaline electrolyte (1M KOH), NiFe LDHs‐E exhibits excellent OER activity with very low overpotential (235 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and current densities up to sixfold (at η = 320 mV) higher than those of NiFe LDHs‐B. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the high OER activities ascribed to the abundant side‐plane edges with optimal strength of binding of OER intermediates. Overall, a comprehensive investigation, employing both experimental and computational methodologies, yields new insights to fabricate superior catalysts meticulously designed with specific crystal planes and unveils the crucial structural attributes, thus unleashing the limitless potential of the catalytic domain.

Development of large-scale alkaline seawater electrolysis requires robust and corrosion-resistant anodes. Here we propose engineering NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based anodes by incorporating a series of anions into the LDH interlayers. The most optimal NiFe LDH anode with intercalated phosphates demonstrates stable operation at a high current density of 1.0 A cm−2 for over 1000 hours in a 2 W-scale alkaline seawater electrolyzer (ASWE). Fundamental studies indicate that the basicity, indicated by pKa values, of the intercalated anions in NiFe LDH governs its oxygen evolution reaction activity and corrosion resistance. Highly basic anions (i.e., phosphates) securely anchor Fe sites and facilitate proton transfer to boost both durability and activity. Notably, we demonstrate the proof-of-concept for the NiFe anode in an industrial 1 kW-scale ASWE stack (1,081.2 cm2 anode area in total). This unit achieves a stable operating current density of 0.5 A cm−2 at about 2.0 V, twice that of the commercial alkaline pure water electrolyzer, contributing to an economically competitive hydrogen production cost of US$ 1.96 kgH2−1. Large-scale alkaline seawater electrolysis demands robust anodes for efficient hydrogen production. Here, the authors report a NiFe layered double hydroxide anode with intercalated phosphates, achieving stable performance at 1.0 A cm−2 for over 1,000 hours, offering improved durability and activity.

Abstract Developing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in an efficient strategy, while maintaining high catalytic activity and stability under high current densities, remains a crucial problem. In this study, a bimetallic iron‐cobalt phytic acid complex loaded with polyaniline hollow structure (FCP@PAn) was successfully constructed, via a progress of selective etching and surface modification in one step without high‐temperature phosphating or carbonization. The as‐obtained FCP@PAn required only 329 and 385 mV overpotentials at high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm −2 , respectively, due to phytic acid and polyaniline incorporation and the coordinated effect of each component. Additionally, the FCP@PAn exhibited the lowest Tafel slope values of 44.6 mV dec −1 and was able to continuously operate for 120 h at 500 mA cm −2 , displaying high catalytic activity and stability. Hence, the hollow structure of the conductive polymer and MOFs composites provided a new surface modification strategy for transition metal‐based catalysts that are prone to dissolution or corrosion during the OER process, as well as for high current density applications.

The development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic media is vital for the commercialization of the proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. In this work, we successfully construct Ru–O–Ir atomic interfaces for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalysts achieve overpotentials as low as 167, 300, and 390 mV at 10, 500, and 1500 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, with the electrocatalyst showing robust stability for >1000 h of operation at 10 mA cm−2 and negligible degradation after 200,000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. Operando spectroelectrochemical measurements together with theoretical investigations reveal that the OER pathway over the Ru–O–Ir active site is near-optimal, where the bridging oxygen site of Ir–OBRI serves as the proton acceptor to accelerate proton transfer on an adjacent Ru centre, breaking the typical adsorption-dissociation linear scaling relationship on a single Ru site and thus enhancing OER activity. Here, we show that rational design of multiple active sites can break the activity/stability trade-off commonly encountered for OER catalysts, offering good approaches towards high-performance acidic OER catalysts. Efficient and stable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution are essential for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Here, the authors report Ru–O–Ir atomic interfaces that enable bridging oxygen-mediated deprotonation pathways, overcoming the activity/stability trade-off in acidic oxygen evolution.

Abstract The long‐term challenge in overall water splitting is the conflict in the pH condition of electrolytes for achieving efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the same time, in addition to the typical cost issue in catalysts. It hence raises an intense research interest in seeking cost‐efficient non‐noble metal electrocatalysts as well as compromising electrolyte conditions for electrocatalytic HER and OER. To tackle the problems, various approaches are demonstrated to engineer the electronic effect on the active sites of catalysts for enhancing the activities. In this work, the core‐shell CoS 2 ─Fe x Co 1‐x S 2 nanooctahedra is fabricated with a tunable Fe content over the surface and took them as the model catalyst for systematic studies in alkaline OER and HER. By various X‐ray spectroscopies as well as electron microscopy, the results showed that the shells of CoS 2 ─Fe x Co 1‐x S 2 nanooctahedra formed the {111} surfaces of Fe 0.9 Co 1.0 S 2 and Fe 0.25 Co 0.75 S 2 with and without the promotion by OH − anions during the syntheses. Catalyzed by the CoS 2 , Fe 0.25 Co 0.75 S 2 , and Fe 0.9 Co 1.0 S 2 {111} surfaces, the results of alkaline OER and HER indicated the Fe 0.9 Co 1.0 S 2 the most superior activities by virtue of the optimized Fe─Co electronic effect. From the predictions by density functional theory (DFT) calculations in reaction thermodynamics, the energy barriers in OER and HER both follow the order of Fe 0.9 Co 0.1 S 2 (111) < Fe 0.25 Co 0.75 S 2 (111) < CoS 2 (111). However, FeS 2 (111) is worse than Fe 0.9 Co 0.1 S 2 (111). From the confirmations by in‐situ X‐ray spectroscopies in reaction kinetics, the Co sites of Fe 0.9 Co 0.1 S 2 (111) on the core‐shell nanooctahedra exhibited much higher activities than those of CoS 2 (111) under the applied potentials for OER and HER, which reflected the electronic benefits from the existing Fe neighbors.

Abstract Nickel‐based electrocatalysts are promising for industrial water electrolysis, but the dense hydroxyl oxide layer formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits active sites accessibility and presents challenges in balancing structural stability with effective charge transfer. Based on this, an efficient in situ leaching strategy is proposed to construct grain boundary‐rich catalyst structure with high charge transfer ability and a deep catalytic active layer reached >200‐nm. Under OER conditions, stable sub‐nano Ni 3 Al particles are embedded in Ni(Fe)OOH, originating from leaching out the unstable Ni 2 Al 3 phase of the initial Ni 2 Al 3 /Ni 3 Al alloy doped with Fe. The structural evolutions are characterized using in situ Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy. The catalyst exhibits exemplary performance, evidenced by a low overpotential of 212 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , a minimal Tafel slope of 25.0 mV dec −1 . The catalyst maintains stable for >500 h at 500 mA cm −2 under industrial conditions. Furthermore, its performance in seawater electrolysis is notably superior, exhibiting an overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 37.5 mV dec −1 . The in situ high activity in the deep porous phase by leaching out unstable phases provides a new method for engineering high‐performance industrial catalysts.

Abstract Efficient and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for fuel cells, metal‐air batteries, and other energy technologies. Here, a highly stable, efficient bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst (FeNi‐NC@MWCNTs) is reported and demonstrated its integration and robust performance in an aqueous Zinc–air battery (ZAB). The catalyst is based on neighboring iron/nickel sites (FeNiN 6 ) which are atomically dispersed on porous nitrogen‐doped carbon particles. The particles are wrapped in electrically conductive multi‐walled carbon nanotubes for enhanced electrical conductivity. Electrocatalytic analyses show high OER and ORR performance (OER/ORR voltage difference = 0.69 V). Catalyst integration in a ZAB results in excellent performance metrics, including an open circuit voltage of 1.44 V, a specific capacity of 782 mAh g −1 (at j = 15 mA cm −2 ), a peak power density of 218 mW cm −2 (at j = 260 mA cm −2 ) and long‐term durability over 600 charge/discharge cycles. Combined experimental and theoretical (density functional theory) analyses provide an in‐depth understanding of the physical and electronic structure of the catalyst and the role of the FeNi dual atom reaction site. The study therefore provides critical insights into the structure and reactivity of high‐performance bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts based on atomically dispersed non‐critical metals.

Abstract Currently, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline seawater still faces problems such as low catalyst activity and Cl − poisoning of active sites. In this work, an electron transfer facilitator of oxygen vacancies is introduced as a driving force for electronic transmission, which enhances the electron‐metal‐support interactions (EMSI) effect while introducing a charge protective layer, realizing killing two birds with one stone. In situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the EMSI effect enhances the H * transfer step at the interface. At the same time, due to oxygen vacancies for the enhanced EMSI, Ru forms an electron‐rich layer, avoiding the poison of Cl − on active sites in seawater for HER. As a result, the Ru/Ni(OH) 2‐x has an overpotential of only 156 mV at a current density of 1.0 A cm −2 in alkaline seawater. After assembling anion‐exchange‐membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE), the Ru/Ni(OH) 2‐x has a flat efficiency of ≈70% at different current densities, low energy consumption and price of per gallon gas equivalent (GGE) H 2 produced. Owning to the well Cl − tolerance, the catalyst also maintains long‐term stability at 0.5 A cm −2 , indicating its great potential for industrial feasibility.

Developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is critical for advancing hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) for hydrogen production. Herein, we report a facile approach to fabricating a hierarchical catalyst featuring ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles uniformly integrated with nitrogen/oxygen co‐doped carbon nanotube aerogels (Ru‐NOCAs). Heteroatoms N and O‐modified CNTs can result in a negatively charged surface to effectively trap Ru3+ ions. Ru‐NOCAs exhibit a well‐defined hierarchical morphology facilitated by the self‐assembly of functional groups on the surface of CNTs, which enhances the interaction between Ru nanoparticles and CNTs. Due to the synergistic effect of hierarchical structure and strong interaction formation, Ru‐NOCAs show excellent catalytic activity and stability. Ru‐NOCAs catalyst demonstrates a remarkable overpotential of 41 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 with a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec‐1 in 1 M KOH and an overpotential of 68 mV with a Tafel slope of 65.8 mV dec‐1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. These results indicate superior catalytic efficiency and enhanced charge transfer kinetics compared to the control samples. This study highlights the effectiveness of incorporating hierarchical structures and tailored surface chemistries in electrocatalyst design, offering new avenues for optimizing HER performance and advancing hydrogen fuel technology.

Hematite is a well-known catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction on photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water-splitting cells. However, the knowledge of hematite-water interfaces and water oxidation mechanisms is still lacking, which limits improvements in photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance. Herein, we use the Fe-terminated hematite (0001) surface as a model and propose a comprehensive mechanism for the oxygen evolution reaction on both non-solvated and solvated surfaces. Key reaction intermediates are identified through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at the density functional theory level with a Hubbard U correction. Several notable intermediates are proposed, and the effects of water solvent on these intermediates and the overall reaction mechanisms are suggested. The proposed mechanisms align well with experimental observations under photoelectrochemical water oxidation conditions. Additionally, we highlight the potential role of O2 desorption in the oxygen evolution reaction on hematite, as O2 adsorption may block reaction sites and increases surface hydrophobicity, leading to an unfavorable pathway for oxygen evolution. Hematite is a promising material for photoelectrochemical water splitting, but its mechanisms are not well understood. Here, the authors report a detailed mechanism, identifying key reaction intermediates and highlighting the influence of solvent water and oxygen desorption on the reaction pathways.

Abstract The electrochemical two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) offers a compelling alternative for decentralized and on‐site H 2 O 2 production compared to the conventional anthraquinone process. To advance this electrosynthesis system, there is growing interest in optimizing the interfacial reaction microenvironment to boost electrocatalytic performance. This review consolidates recent advancements in reaction microenvironment engineering for the selective electrocatalytic conversion of O 2 to H 2 O 2 . Starting with fundamental insights into interfacial electrocatalytic mechanisms, an overview of various strategies for constructing the favorable local reaction environment, including adjusting electrode wettability, enhancing mesoscale mass transfer, elevating local pH, incorporating electrolyte additives, and employing pulsed electrocatalysis techniques is provided. Alongside these regulation strategies, the corresponding analyses and technical remarks are also presented. Finally, a summary and outlook on critical challenges, suggesting future research directions to inspire microenvironment engineering and accelerate the practical application of H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis is delivered.

Abstract The development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for advancing renewable hydrogen energy technology. However, the slow deprotonation kinetics of oxo‐intermediates, involving the four proton‐coupled electron steps, hinder the acidic OER progress. Herein, a RuTiO x solid solution electrocatalyst is investigated, which features bridged oxygen (O bri ) sites that act as proton acceptors, accelerating the deprotonation of oxo‐intermediates. Electrochemical tests, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory results reveal that the moderate proton adsorption energy on O bri sites facilitates fast deprotonation kinetics through the adsorbate evolution mechanism. This process effectively prevents the over‐oxidation and deactivation of Ru sites caused by the lattice oxygen mechanism. Consequently, RuTiO x shows a low overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm −2 geo and performance exceeding 1400 h at 50 mA cm −2 geo with negligible deactivation. These insights into the OER mechanism and the structure‐function relationship are crucial for the advancement of catalytic systems.

The pursuit of efficient and economical catalysts for water splitting, a critical step in hydrogen production, has gained momentum with the increasing demand for sustainable energy. Among the various electrocatalysts developed to date, cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its availability, stability, and catalytic activity. However, intrinsic limitations, including low catalytic activity and poor electrical conductivity, often hinder its effectiveness in electrocatalytic water splitting. To overcome these challenges, substantial efforts have focused on enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4 by synthesizing composites with conductive materials, transition metals, carbon-based nanomaterials, and metal–organic frameworks. This review explores the recent advancements in Co3O4-based composites for the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction, emphasizing strategies such as nanostructuring, doping, hybridization, and surface modification to improve catalytic performance. Additionally, it examines the mechanisms driving the enhanced activity and stability of these composites while also discussing the future potential of Co3O4-based electrocatalysts for large-scale water-splitting applications.

In recent years, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental remediation has become a topic of great interest. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), linked by covalent bonds, have emerged as promising materials in the field of electrocatalysis due to their well-defined structures, high specific surface areas, tunable pore structures, and excellent acid–base stability. However, the low conductivity of COF materials often limits their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. To enhance the catalytic performance of COF-based catalysts, various nanomaterials are integrated into COFs to form composite catalysts. The stable and tunable porous structure of COFs provides an ideal platform for these nanomaterials, leading to improved electrocatalytic activity. Through rational design, COF-based composite electrocatalysts can achieve synergistic effects between nanomaterials and the COF carrier, enabling efficient targeted electrocatalysis. This review summarizes the applications of nanomaterial-incorporated COF-based catalysts in hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. Additionally, it outlines design principles for COF-based composite electrocatalysis, focusing on structure–activity relationships and synergistic effects in COF composite nanomaterial electrocatalysts, as well as challenges and future perspectives for next-generation composite electrocatalysts.

Abstract Electrocatalysis plays a central role in clean energy conversion and sustainable technologies. However, the trade-off between activity and stability of electrocatalysts significantly hinders their practical applications, notably in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for producing hydrogen and solar fuels. Here we report a steam-assisted synthesis armed with machine learning screening of an integrated ruthenium-titanium-manganese electrode, featuring intrinsic metal-support interactions. These atomic-scale interactions with self-healing capabilities radically address the activity-stability dilemma across all pH levels. Consequently, our electrode achieved high mass activities, 48.5, 112.8 and 74.6 times those of benchmark ruthenium oxides in acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively; and stable operation for up to 3,000 hours, a multi-fold improvement in stability over the reported advanced catalysts. The breakthrough in activity-stability limitations highlights the potential of intrinsic metal-support interactions for enhancing electrolysis and other heterogeneous catalysis.

Abstract High‐entropy compounds (HECs) provide extensive possibilities for exploring distinctive properties and potential applications. However, most HECs reported so far are synthesized by an arduous high‐temperature treatment and special equipment, which is clearly not scalable for practical application. Here a scalable room‐temperature solution synthetic strategy is reported for a library of high‐entropy borates with arbitrary metal component numbers from 5 to 12 up to 3302 kinds in total and more than a hundred grams per operation within one minute. In conjunction with theoretical and in situ investigations, it is uncovered that the highly local concentration of protons at ethanol/aqueous interface is favorable to the creation of a stable thermodynamic microenvironment and a desirable kinetic miscibility reservoir, thus enabling a formation of single‐phase borates. With the FeCoNiMoCu high‐entropy borate, it is further shows that it functions as a highly active catalyst for catalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The work opens up opportunities for the scalable synthesis of HECs for energy storage and conversion applications.

Abstract Ruthenium (Ru)‐based catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives to Iridium (Ir) catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis cells due to their lower price and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. However, their stability is compromised by generation of unstable high‐valence Ru sites and oxygen vacancy in a lattice oxygen‐mediated (LOM) pathway. Here, a low‐load Ru site on a Barium (Ba)‐doped Co 3 O 4 (RuBa x Co 3–x O 4 ) catalyst is developed with abundant Ruthenium─Cobalt (Ru─Co) pairs for enhanced acidic OER activity. The incorporation of Ba can efficiently modulate the lattice of Co 3 O 4 , creating Ru─Co active pairs with optimized spacing through compression stress. In situ characterizations exhibit contractive Ru─Co pairs that promote the rapid and direct coupling of * O─O * radicals, bypassing the sluggish * OOH species and avoiding the oxygen vacancies, which can trigger the oxide path mechanism (OPM) for an efficient and stable OER process. As a result, the designed catalyst delivers a low overpotential of 219 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and also demonstrates excellent stability, maintaining performance over 50 h of continuous operation at a larger current density of 50 mA cm −2 . These findings highlight the potential of the RuBa x Co 3‐x O 4 catalysts for durable and efficient OER applications.

Replacing global depleting fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources that are affordable and environmentally-benign, is from the most pressing challenges for the future socio-economic developments. To that goal, electrochemical water splitting would provide green hydrogen fuel which is considered one of the most promising energy carriers. However, the viability of the process still hinges on the availability of robust earth-abundant electrocatalysts that catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In recent years, transition metal based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) electrocatalysts, with advantageous physio-chemical properties, can represent a promising outstanding research approaches to accelerate the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of these two half-reactions. Herein, we present brief explanations of the reaction mechanisms and the important parameters relating to the electrochemical water splitting along with the recent developments of different LDHs derived electrocatalysts towards the HER/OER performances. Furthermore, the innovative fabrication strategies of the LDHs systems and the subsequent evolution of the LDHs classes, including adopted modification strategies including cation/anion doping, defect engineering, exchanging interlayer anions, nanostructured morphology, designing hierarchical heterostructures or nanocomposites, etc. Finally, the current perspectives and challenges of some critical issues as well as the future opportunities for the developments of outstanding LDHs-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical water electrolysis are also provided.

Abstract In the present work, we investigates the potential of two dimensional (2D) Janus MoSH monolayer as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting using first-principles calculations. Our results shows that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits excellent structural stability and electronic properties, which are essential for efficient electrocatalysis. We find that the charge transfer mechanism between Mo and S atoms plays a crucial role in the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer. Due to the asymmetric structure of MoSH monolayer, it has intrinsic electric field with dipole moment of 0.24 D. Moreover, we demonstrate that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits high catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential 0.04 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotential 0.11 V, making it a promising candidate for overall water splitting. Our findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of 2D monolayered materials for renewable energy production. By providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of HER and OER on 2D Janus MoSH monolayer, our study paves the way for the development of efficient and sustainable electrocatalysts for water splitting. We hope that current work will be helpful in understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer and its potential applications in renewable energy production.

Abstract Electrolysis of seawater using anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) under neutral conditions, is an attractive method for hydrogen production. Unfortunately, competitive anodic chlorine evolution reaction together with sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics caused by insufficient OH − , significantly limit the system's current density and operational stability. Herein, Lewis base phosphate (PO 4 3− ) is used as a proton acceptor to accelerate the cleavage of OH−H bonds, which facilitates the accumulation of *OH. NiFeP nanosheets grown on pretreated nickel foam (NiS‐A) are used as the free‐standing electrode. During the OER process, the pre‐catalyst NiFeP spontaneously transforms into Lewis base‐PO 4 3− decorated Ni(Fe)OOH. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that Ni(Fe)OOH active phases adsorb H 2 O intermediates and synergize with the protophilic Lewis base PO 4 3− to favor the dissociation of water molecules (*H 2 O→*OH+H + +e − ), ensuring the timely supply of *OH in neutral media. Meanwhile, PO 4 3− also exhibits excellent ability to repel chloride ions in seawater splitting, achieving ≈98.2% oxygen Faradaic efficiency. The optimized NiFeP/NiS‐A delivers a low overpotential (280 mV at 10 mA cm −2 ) and long‐term OER durability (over 400 h at 500 mA cm −2 ). Integrating NiFeP/NiS‐A in a seawater‐based AEMWE can achieve an industrially required current density of 1.0 A cm −2 (60 °C) at 1.8 V and an operation stability over 220 h.

Developing a low‐cost, robust, and high‐performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine‐linked isoindigo‐based covalent organic networks. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar 2D‐nanosheets covalent organic framework (I‐TTA COF), whereas its combination with ionic non‐planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (I‐TG COP) with a fibrous morphology. The sheet‐like crystalline I‐TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I‐TG COP. I‐TTA exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of ~134 mV for HER (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and ~283 mV for OER (in 1 M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I‐TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal‐free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24 hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted much attention as an efficient alternative reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its low required overpotential. Despite significant progress in efficient nickel‐based catalysts, the fundamental issues regarding product selectivity control and dissociation mechanism during the UOR process have not been clarified. Here, we report that tuning the electron delocalization strength of Ni sites significantly affects the OH‐ binding sites, altering urea molecule dissociation patterns in alkaline systems. Using spinel NiCo2O4 as a model catalyst, the charge delocalization strength of nickel active centers is influenced by the degree of phosphorus‐substituted anions. Specifically, complete phosphorus‐substituted spinel enhances N2 selectivity to over 26.8% with a peak current density of 300 mA·cm‐2, while partial phosphorus‐substituted spinel achieves a Faraday efficiency of 78.1% for liquid products (NOx‐). Experiments and theory reveal that strong charge delocalization at Ni sites favors remote‐site attack on urea molecules by hydroxide ions, whereas weak delocalization prefers nearby‐site attack, enhancing UOR efficiency and suppressing OER in both pathways.

The activity of nickel-based electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is influenced by the presence of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte. Since the underlying mechanism is not fully resolved yet, we conducted a study combining Raman, FTIR, and photoelectron spectroscopies. We found that an improved OER activity correlates with structural changes of the catalyst. The cations are adsorbed in increasing amounts in the order Li+ < Na+ < K+ < Cs+, opening the layers of the NiOOH layered double-hydroxide structure and promoting a transition from a more β-like to a more γ-like NiOOH phase. In addition, the NiOOH surface gets increasingly deprotonated with increasing alkali cation size. We stabilized the activated catalyst materials in ultra-high vacuum and exposed them to controlled doses of H2O to analyse the catalyst-electrolyte interface in a quasi in-situ approach with photoelectron spectroscopy. Going from Li+ to Cs+, more OH groups are found on the surface after the exposure to H2O, demonstrating that such structural changes are facilitating the dissociation of H2O. As the dissociation of H2O is a crucial step in many OER mechanisms, its modified efficiency can be correlated with the observed trends in OER activity in LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and CsOH.

Abstract Rearranging the electronic orbitals of metal sites through interface engineering is the breakthrough for achieving high efficiencies in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) on bimetallic catalysts. Here, via a multistep liquid‐phase synthesis strategy, the crystalline‐amorphous (c‐a) interface is built by coating amorphous oxyhydroxide layer on the surface of crystallized copper(II) sulfide (CuS@MOOH, M = iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni)) with an internal cavity. For HER, c‐a interface facilitates the electron filling of the 3d orbitals of Cu, thereby enhancing the coordination between Cu sites (Cu 2+ /Cu + ) and *H and reducing the energy barrier for *H adsorption. For OER, c‐a interface triggers electronic rearrangement in the 3d orbitals of M sites, prompting electron transition from the t2g orbitals to the eg orbitals to achieve a half‐filled state, optimizing the oxygen‐intermediates adsorption on M sites (M 3+ /M 4+ ). Among CuS@MOOH, the as‐marked CuS@CoOOH‐6 exhibits the best activities with ultra‐low overpotentials of 62 mV (HER) and 136 mV (OER). Only 1.52 V is sufficient to power the electrolyzer with CuS@CoOOH‐6‐based cathode/anode, maintaining a ultra‐stable efficiency (96.9 %) over 72 h. Notably, CuS@CoOOH‐6 also exhibits impressive activity/durability for natural seawater electrolysis. This study enhances understanding of the properties and electronic structure of the c‐a interface for water splitting.

This study reports the patterns of electroplating a composite coating containing phases of nanocrystalline metallic nickel and cerium dioxide from an electrolyte based on a new generation of ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Currently, the use of DESs is an extremely promising direction for the electrochemical deposition of electrocatalytic coatings for electrochemical energy, particularly for "green" hydrogen energy. The electrolyte for deposition contained a liquid eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea (the so-called "reline", a typical representative of DESs), in which nickel (II) chloride (0.1 mol/dm³) and cerium (III) chloride (0.2–0.4 mol/dm3) were dissolved. According to the results of energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and XRD investigations, the composite coating contains approximately 12–16 at.% cerium, presumably in the form of cerium dioxide. A reaction scheme for the formation of the composite nanocoating, which includes a combination of chemical and electrochemical stages, is proposed. It was found that the incorporation of cerium oxide leads to a significant increase in electrocatalytic activity (compared to nickel coating) in the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction and anodic oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions. It is hypothesized that the observed enhancement in electrocatalytic effect is due to the formation of additional active catalytic sites on the surface containing cerium in different oxidation states (e.g., Ce(+4)/Ce(+3)), which can act as electron carriers in both cathodic and anodic reactions. A significant advantage of this composite is its bifunctionality as an electrocatalyst, meaning it can be used for both cathodic and anodic processes. The obtained results can be used in the development of new high-efficiency processes for the electrochemical synthesis of "green" hydrogen.

Sustainable energy materials for energy storage applications are crucial for a reliable energy transition. However, evaluating material sustainability in early stages of energy material research is a big challenge, as it is difficult to predict the final industrial process and supply chain of the investigated material. In this work we showcase that a sustainability evaluation can already be conducted in the early stage of electrocatalyst research. We provide a case study of two highly active alkaline oxygen evolution catalysts La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ with a thin film model catalyst approach. For the sustainability evaluation, we consider the material criticality, compare precursor prices, conduct an environmental impact analysis of the precursors based on life cycle assessment and provide a qualitative discourse for social impacts of raw material extraction. We find that La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ has a reduced environmental footprint, smaller precursor supply risk and 10 times lower precursor price compared to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ. However, for both perovskites the high environmental impact and high supply risk of lanthanum is of immediate concern towards larger scale application purposes. Sustainability evaluation in the early stages of energy material research can be a great chance to develop new material selection strategies leveraging sustainability in later stages of materials research for the energy transition.

Abstract The design of heterojunctions offers a crucial solution for energy conversion and storage challenges, but current research predominantly focuses on charge transfer benefits, often neglecting spin attribute regulation despite the increasing recognition of spin‐sensitivity in many chemical reactions. In this study, a novel magnetic heterostructure, CoFe 2 O 4 @CoFeMo 3 O 8 , is designed to simultaneously modulate charge and spin characteristics, and systematically elucidated their synergistic impact on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Experimental results and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the magnetic heterostructure exhibits both charge transfer and spin polarization. It is found that the charge‐transfer behavior enhances conductivity and adsorption ability through band structure regulation. Meanwhile, magnetically polarized electrons promote triplet O 2 generation and accelerate electron transport via spin‐selective pathways. Moreover, the heterostructure's effective response to external alternating magnetic fields further amplifies the spin‐dependent effect and introduces a magnetothermal effect, locally heating the active sites through spin flip, thereby boosting catalytic activity. Consequently, the OER activity of the magnetic heterostructure is improved by 83.8 times at 1.5 V compared to its individual components. This magnetic heterojunction strategy presents a promising avenue for advanced catalysis through synergistic regulating of charge‐transfer and spin‐ordering.

Due to the intricate composition and recalcitrant nature of coking wastewater, the biochemical effluent often fails to meet standards. This study explored the preparation of particle electrodes, utilizing activated carbon powder (PAC) loading single-element Fe, Co, and Ni, as well as dual-element Ni–Fe and Co–Fe as catalyst. The particle electrode system was integrated with persulphate (PS) activation to enhance its performance. The effects of potassium persulphate (KPS) dosages, currents, and Ni:Fe ratios were investigated. The results showed that bimetallic particle electrodes outperformed their monometallic particle electrodes. Among the five electrode materials, Ni–Fe/PAC achieved the best degradation efficiency of 84.4% and the lowest energy consumption of 19.73 kW·h·kg−1 COD. When the initial concentrations of TOC and COD were set at 300 and 280 mg L−1, the Ni–Fe/PAC with 5 mmol L−1 KPS achieved removal efficiencies of 61.7 and 84.4%, respectively. The metals on Ni/PAC and Co/PAC existed in the zero-valent state, while Fe on Fe/PAC was present as Fe2O3. Co–Fe/PAC exhibited the formation of CoFe2O4 oxides. Ni–Fe/PAC possessed the lowest hydrogen evolution reaction potential (−0.28 V), and the highest oxygen evolution potential (2.4 V), and reached an electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 236.3 cm2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves indicated that the direct redox reactions and indirect oxidation of pollutants occurred concurrently. Both •OH and ⋅SO4− radicals played crucial roles during the degradation processes. The degradation efficiency of organic matter was as follows: benzene compounds (88.4%) >heterocyclic compounds (75.3%) >polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (53.9%).

The dissolution of active atoms under operating potential will lead to a decline in their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, thus preventing the current highly active catalysts from being practically applicable in industrial water electrolysis. Here, we propose a sequential leaching strategy to utilize the dynamic restructuring and enhance the chemical bond strength for highly active and stable OER. Modeling on nickel-iron sulfides (NiFe-S), we introduced and utilized foreign Mo dopant preleaching as the sacrificial agent to alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial M─S bonds. Operando spectroscopic reveal that foreign Mo dopant leach from the matrix and then adsorb on the surface of NiFe O(S)OH as molybdate at lower OER potential. The crystal occupation hamiltonian population analysis uncovers that the charge transfer from molybdate into NiFe O(S)OH will enhance bond energy of M─S, thus preventing further S and Fe/Ni leaching. By manipulating ion leaching, the resulting active phase achieves an ultralow overpotential of 250 mV at 400 mA cm −2 and high stability of more than 3,700 h at 100 mA cm −2 . An industrial water electrolysis equipment using our catalysts delivered ultralow energy consumption of 4.30 kWh m −3 H2 and record stability over 250 h (2,300 h lifetime by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) under a high working current of 8,000 mA. The hydrogen production cost of US$2.46/kg H2 aligns with the green hydrogen cost target set by the European Commission for the coming decade.

Water-splitting technology is crucial for generating green hydrogen energy, a sustainable and clean fuel source that can significantly decrease reliance on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thereby helping to mitigate the global energy crisis. Renewable energy sources are expected to significantly replace fossil fuels, contributing to lowering greenhouse gas releases and helping to mitigate the energy crisis. The water-splitting process for generating green hydrogen energy is acknowledged as a promising approach toward achieving carbon neutrality. In this context, the attributes and features of electrocatalysts have a crucial part in shaping the reaction activity and selectivity of both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes involved in the water-splitting process. In addition to traditional noble-metal-based catalysts, carbon-based materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and porous carbons have proven effective for catalyzing these reactions. A highly effective strategy to enhance their electrical, physical, and chemical characteristics involves doping them with heteroatoms like nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), boron (B), and transition metals. These materials, renowned for their exceptional characteristics, have been extensively researched in both the academic and industrial sectors for diverse applications, like energy conversion and storage technologies. This chapter comprehensively reviews notable advancements in the progress of heteroatom-doped carbon allotropes materials and their utilization in overall water splitting, highlighting different synthesis methods and strategies like templating strategy, hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis, chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and high-temperature annealing aimed at achieving heteroatom-doped carbon allotrope materials with diverse types and quantities of dopants (both metallic and non-metallic), as well as multi-atoms. Additionally, the discussion underlines the structural and morphological characteristics that elucidate the structure-property relationship and improvements in the physicochemical features of heteroatom-doped carbon allotropes. It explores how heteroatom doping enhances different properties, such as conductivity, and optimizes surface adsorption for various reaction intermediates, as evidenced by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the chapter explores recent promising studies of heteroatom-doped carbon allotropes with excellent catalytic performance and reveals their future prospects for overall water splitting.

The impact of global warming on the ocean’s oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) is uncertain, partly because of a lack of data on past changes. We report monthly resolved records of coral skeleton–bound nitrogen isotopes (CS-δ 15 N) to reconstruct denitrification in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ over the last 80 years. The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability. ODZ evolution over the next century will depend on how global warming interacts with the decadal oscillations.

The addition of oxygen or nitrogen in refractory high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has been widely reported, but studies on boron-doped HEAs have mainly focused on the segregation of boron elements at grain boundaries. The changes in the microstructure and mechanical properties in TiZrNb-based HEAs remain enigmatic. In this work, boron-doped Ti35Zr30V10Nb25 (Ti35-xB) refractory HEAs were designed to elucidate their microstructural evolution and mechanical properties. Unlike oxygen and nitrogen, trace amounts of boron addition result in the formation of borides, and boron exhibits a strong repulsion towards Zr, leading to Zr-depleted borides. Borides distributed along the grain boundaries refine the grain size and dendritic structure. The borides and structural refinement effect enhance the strain-hardening capacity and uniform elongation, resulting in an over 15% uniform elongation for Ti35-0.25B.

High-altitude plants face extreme environments such as low temperature, low oxygen, low nutrient levels, and strong ultraviolet radiation, causing them to adopt complex adaptation mechanisms. Phenotypic variation is the core manifestation of ecological adaptation and evolution. Many plants have developed a series of adaptive strategies through long-term natural selection and evolution, enabling them to survive and reproduce under such harsh conditions. This article reviews the techniques and methods used in recent years to study the adaptive evolution of high-altitude plants, including transplantation techniques, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics techniques, and their applications in high-altitude plant adaptive evolution. Transplantation technology focuses on phenotypic variation, which refers to natural variations in morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, exploring their key roles in nutrient utilization, photosynthesis optimization, and stress-resistance protection. Multiple omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have revealed genes, regulatory pathways, and metabolic networks associated with phenotypic variations at the genetic and molecular levels. At the same time, the limitations and deficiencies of current technologies used to study plant adaptation to high-altitude environments were discussed. In addition, we propose future improvements to existing technologies and advocate for the integration of different technologies at multiple levels to study the molecular mechanisms of plant adaptation to high-altitude environments, thus providing insights for future research in this field.

Abstract Feedback processes that drove Earth's second major increase in ocean–atmosphere oxygen levels during the Neoproterozoic are poorly constrained. Variability in seawater redox over geological timescales is commonly linked to changes in the biogeochemical cycling of P and thus the rate of primary production and generation of photosynthetic oxygen. In the modern surface ocean, an important source of bioessential P and micronutrients (Fe, Cu, Co, Zn, Mo, Cr and Ni) is aeolian dust derived from deserts and arid, post‐glacial landscapes. It is interpreted herein that glacial retreat following the Sturtian ( ca 717 to 660 Ma) and Marinoan ( ca 650 to 635 Ma) snowball glaciations provided copious dust to the global ocean. Correlation of interglacial siltstone successions in palaeogeographical context suggests that such dust accumulation was diachronous and concentrated in the palaeo‐horse latitudes (30° N and 30° S). Delivery of this dust from continents is likely reflected in the steep increase in global radiogenic Sr isotope values ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) in post‐Sturtian carbonates, and changes in the δ 18 O signatures of Cryogenian zircons derived from subducted marine sediments. Accumulation of sedimentary organic matter also peaked during interglacial periods, suggesting a causal link between glaciation, aeolian dust and primary production. This relationship implies windblown dust was an important source of P and micronutrients for an evolving biological pump that stimulated primary production, enhanced burial of organic carbon and increased ocean–atmosphere oxygen concentrations. Thus, delivery of aeolian dust to the global ocean was likely critical for sustaining Earth's second major increase in oxygen. Sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 in organic‐rich siltstones and shales is also interpreted to have been an important negative feedback process, which together with silicate weathering, prevented runaway greenhouse conditions during interglacial periods. The oxygen produced by this aeolian marine biological pump may have helped pave the way for the evolution of multicellular animals in the Ediacaran.

Aim and objectives: This study aimed to explore insulin necessity in hospitalized patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) for the first six months after COVID-19 infection. A pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulative status probably contribute to the risk of worse outcomes in diabetes. Material and Methods: A number of 78 non-insulin necessitate diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection which needed oxygen therapy were included in the research. There were collected parameters routinely assessed to detect the possible predictors of diabetic patient evolution in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The evolution of insulin necessity for 78 patients with non-insulin-dependent DM at admission was towards transformation into insulin-dependent DM at 6 months after discharge in 30 cases (38.5%), while the rest of the patients remained on oral antidiabetic drugs (48 patients, 61.5%). Conclusions: At hospitalized diabetic patient with covid-19 infection under corticotherapy, statistically significant differences were noted in HbA1c and aPTT level at 3 and 6 months after discharge.

Abstract Large-scale fire tests at the University of Waterloo compare behaviour of a Canadian non-fire retardant faux leather couch and a UK fire-retardant faux leather couch of the same construction under ventilation limited conditions. Results reveal that both fuel loads reach maximum, but different, mass loss rates at minimum oxygen concentration in the environment. Following this, they document the rapid decay in fuel mass loss rate with consequent decrease in temperature through the burn structure. Time-varying volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide data show preferential increase in concentration as combustion efficiency decreases. The paper adds novel time varying, simultaneously collected fuel mass, temperature and concentration data with aim to provide new insight into the full evolution of compartment fires through transition from early growth to ventilation limited conditions and subsequent fire decay.

The Ordovician dolomite in the Ordos Basin is an important natural gas reservoir. Exploring dolomite genesis and the factors influencing reservoir characteristics is essential for deep carbonate rock exploration. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of dolomite evolution using methods such as thin-section petrography, isotope analysis, and trace and rare earth elements. The analysis shows that: Based on petrographic observations of the Majiagou Formation in the study area, the dolomite in the study area can be divided into residual oolitic dolomite of synsedimentary or metasomatic origin, micritic dolomite of secondary metasomatism or recrystallization origin, powder crystal dolomite, and fine crystal dolomite. Reservoir pores mainly develop intergranular pores, mold pores, dissolved pores, and fractures. Combined with the characteristics of major elements, trace elements, carbon and oxygen isotopes, rare earth elements, and inclusions in the study area, it can be concluded that the fifth member dolomite of the Majiagou Formation is of shallow–medium burial origin. The diagenetic evolution sequence from the penecontemporaneous period to the middle–deep burial period in the study area is penecontemporaneous dolomite, anhydrite dissolution → seepage silt filling, freshwater dolomite, calcite, and gypsum filling, pressure solution compaction, calcite partial dissolution → gypsum filling, karst cave, buried hydrothermal dolomite, dolomite partial dissolution → calcite complete dissolution, pore dissolution expansion, and quartz pyrite filling. In the early stage of compaction and pressure solution, the primary pores are rapidly reduced, and in the later stage, sutures are generated to provide channels for reservoir fluid migration. The recrystallization reduces the porosity during the middle–deep burial period.

Motivation: This abstract focuses on educating on how high-gradient MRI systems can utilize the multi-echo functional MRI (ME-fMRI) techniques. Goal(s): We explain the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal technique and how additional echoes can improve the signal fidelity. Approach: The ME-fMRI, using three or more echoes allow for the pixelwise T2* decay to be modeled, and as BOLD contrast is a function of T2* evolution over time, an experiment sampling the voxel-wise T2* signal decay can be used to separate BOLD from artifact signal constituents. Results: Gradient systems with ultra-rapid slew rates (&gt; 400 T/m/s) allow ME-fMRI to reduce artefacts from flow, motion, and susceptibility effects. Impact: MRI systems with ultra-high gradient systems can reduce artefacts from flow, motion, and susceptibility effects in the BOLD contrast technique using an ME-fMRI technique with three or more echoes to improve fidelity of fMRI.

Abstract Phosphorothioation serves as a DNA backbone modification mechanism, wherein a sulfur atom substitutes the nonbridging oxygen atom within the phosphodiester, facilitated by the gene products of dndABCDE or sspABCD. The combination of dndABCDE with dndFGH forms a bona fide defense system, where the DndFGH protein complex exhibits DNA nickase and DNA translocase activities to prevent phage invasion. In this study, we identified that dndI, co-transcribed with dndFGH, can independently couple with iscS-dndBCDE as an anti-phage defense system. Moreover, we resolved the crystal structure of DndI from Salmonella at a resolution of 3.10 Å. We discovered that its residue Y25, residing within a hydrophobic region of DndI, is involved in phosphorothioate (PT) sensing. Upon sensing PT modifications at 5′-GPSAAC-3′/5′-GPSTTC-3′, the ATPase activity of DndI is stimulated, which subsequently triggers a conformational transition, facilitating the dissociation of DndI from self-DNA, thereby allowing DndI to avoid cleaving self-DNA while restricting PT-deficient phage DNA. This research broadens the knowledge of the mechanistic diversity underlying PT-based defense systems and highlights their complexity in the course of evolution.

Abstract Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolic intermediate and the product of various natural and synthetic one-carbon (C1) assimilation pathways. While an efficient conversion of acetyl-CoA into other central metabolites, such as pyruvate, is imperative for high biomass yields, available aerobic pathways typically release previously fixed carbon in the form of CO 2 . To overcome this loss of carbon, we develop a new-to-nature pathway, the Lcm module, in this study. The Lcm module provides a direct link between acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, is shorter than any other oxygen-tolerant route and notably fixes CO 2 , instead of releasing it. The Lcm module relies on the new-to-nature activity of a coenzyme B 12 -dependent mutase for the conversion of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA into lactyl-CoA. We demonstrate Lcm activity of the scaffold enzyme 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase from Bacillus massiliosenegalensis , and further improve catalytic efficiency 10-fold by combining in vivo targeted hypermutation and adaptive evolution in an engineered Escherichia coli selection strain. Finally, in a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the complete Lcm module in vitro. Overall, our work demonstrates a synthetic CO 2 -incorporating acetyl-CoA assimilation route that expands the metabolic solution space of central carbon metabolism, providing options for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.

Plant respiratory burst oxidase homologs (Rbohs) are key enzymes that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which serve as signaling molecules regulating plant growth and stress responses. In this study, 39 TaRboh genes (TaRboh01–TaRboh39) were identified. These genes were distributed unevenly among the wheat genome’s fourteen chromosomes, with the exception of homoeologous group 2 and 7 and chromosomes 4A, as well as one unidentified linkage group (Un). TaRbohs were classified into ten distinct clades, each sharing similar motif compositions and gene structures. The promoter regions of TaRbohs contained cis-elements related to hormones, growth and development, and stresses. Furthermore, five TaRboh genes (TaRboh26, TaRboh27, TaRboh31, TaRboh32, and TaRboh34) exhibited strong evolutionary conservation. Additionally, a Ka/Ks analysis confirmed that purifying selection was the predominant force driving the evolution of these genes. Expression profiling and qPCR results further indicated differential expression patterns of TaRboh genes between heat and drought stresses. TaRboh11, TaRboh20, TaRboh22, TaRboh24, TaRboh29, and TaRboh34 were significantly upregulated under multiple stress conditions, whereas TaRboh30 was only elevated in response to drought stress. Collectively, our findings provide a systematic analysis of the wheat Rboh gene family and establish a theoretical framework for our future research on the role of Rboh genes in response to heat and drought stress.

Abstract Despite extensive investigation on the lattice oxygen redox (LOR) in Li‐rich cathodes, significant challenges remain in utilizing LOR activity without compromising structural and electrochemical stability. Related breakthroughs are hindered by the lack of understanding regarding how different LOR activity influences the structural evolution and electrochemical stability, and what is the optimal LOR activity. Herein, the degree of LOR activity is successfully regulated from 22% to 92% in Co‐free Li‐rich cathodes (Li 1+x Mn 0.62 Ni 0.18 O 2 ) by controlling local chemical disorder, and the relationship between LOR activity and cycling stability is revealed. Conventional consensus is challenged by new findings that the over‐suppressive LOR activity also undermines electrochemical/structural stability, and even causes more severe voltage fading compared to cases with excessive LOR. However, their failure mechanisms related to lattice strain present different characteristics. Based on the established understanding, the appropriate LOR activation is necessary to balance the maximum reversible LOR activity and good stability, and the optimal degree is identified as 86% in Li 1.18 Mn 0.62 Ni 0.18 O 2 (LR‐78). LR‐78 exhibits remarkable voltage retention of 96% after 400 cycles at 1 C, and superior high‐rate cyclability without capacity decay within 600 cycles at 5 C. These findings significantly broaden the understanding of LOR mechanisms and provide critical guidance for designing durable LOR‐based cathodes.

CaO‐Al 2 O 3 ‐B 2 O 3 ‐based slag is among the most promising “nonreactive” mold fluxes for continuous casting of high‐aluminum steel. However, CaO‐Al 2 O 3 ‐B 2 O 3 ‐based slag system exhibits a stronger crystallization ability compared to traditional mold fluxes. Herein, calcium oxide in CaO‐Al 2 O 3 ‐10%B 2 O 3 slag is partially replaced by the same mass of barium oxide (5 and 10 mass%) to adjust the crystallization ability. The crystallization of glassy slags is then investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter and their crystallization kinetics are analyzed using the Matusita–Sakka model. The structural evolution of glassy slags from room temperature to 1200 °C is also investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The kinetic analysis shows that the crystallization process of CaO‐Al 2 O 3 ‐B 2 O 3 ‐BaO glassy slags follows the surface crystallization mechanism. The predominant crystalline products are calcium monoaluminate (CaAl 2 O 4 ) and calcium borate (Ca 3 (BO 3 ) 2 ). The partial replacement of calcium oxide by barium oxide inhibits the growth of CaAl 2 O 4 in the slag by increasing the activation energy of crystal growth. The high‐temperature Raman spectroscopy study shows that the band between 700 and 900 cm −1 gets weaker relative to the band between 450 and 650 cm −1 at high temperatures. This indicates the strengthening of bending vibration of Al‐O‐Al, which is consistent with the precipitation of CaAl 2 O 4 with full oxygen bridging.

Background and Objectives: A large amount of recent evidence suggests that cellular inability to consume oxygen could play a notable part in promoting sepsis as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The latter could, in fact, represent a fundamental stage in the evolution of the “natural history” of sepsis. Following a study previously conducted by the same working group on heart samples, the present research project aims to evaluate, through an immunohistochemical study, the existence and/or extent of oxidative stress in the brains of subjects who died due to sepsis and define, after reviewing the literature, its contribution to the septic process to support the use of medications aimed at correcting redox anomalies in the management of septic patients. Materials and Methods: 10 cases of subjects who died in healthcare facilities with ante-mortem clinical-laboratory signs that allowed the diagnosis of septic shock were selected as case studies, and 1 case of a subject who died immediately following a road traffic accident was used as a negative control. Samples of the cerebral cortex were then taken, fixed in formalin, and subjected to sections on which an immunohistochemical study was performed using anti-NOX-2, NT, iNOS, and 8-OHdG antibodies. Results: The results emerging from the present study demonstrate that despite a variable expressivity for the NT, iNOS, and NOX2 markers, the brain samples demonstrated univocal and high positivity for the 8-OHdG marker. Conclusions: This would allow us to hypothesize how, regardless of the mechanism of production of ROS and NOS (iNOS or NOX2 mediated) and the pathophysiological mechanisms that are triggered during sepsis, oxidative damage to DNA represents the event to which this whole process leads and, in fact, in the literature, is directly correlated to sepsis-dependent mortality. Neurons, conversely, appear to be more sensitive to oxidative stress because of a low number of protective or scavenger molecules (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, GSH, or vitamin E). Therefore, despite reduced production, the manifestation of the damage remains high. This evidence, together with that of the previous study, can only support the introduction of substances with an antioxidant function in the guidelines for the treatment of sepsis.

Studies on cerium oxo clusters (CeOCs) are not only significant for understanding the redox and hydrolysis behaviors of Ce(III/IV) ions but also crucial for the rational synthesis of novel clusters and nanoceria with specific Ce(III)/Ce(IV) ratios. Here, two sets of reactions were conducted using cerium nitrate and H 2 O 2 -oxidized cerium nitrate, resulting in the formation of two distinct mixed-valent CeOCs [Ce III 4 Ce IV 10 O 14 (OH) 2 (PhCO 2 ) 22 (DMF) 6 ] (Ce 14 ) and [Ce III 2 Ce IV 22 O 28 (OH) 8 (PhCO 2 ) 30 (DMF) 4 ] (Ce 24C ). These two clusters exhibit different structures and Ce(III)/Ce(IV) ratios, demonstrating the critical role of cerium oxidation states and the occurrence of redox reactions in cluster formation. Ce 14 is the first tetradecanuclear CeOC with a novel structure, whereas Ce 24C differed in its Ce(III)/Ce(IV) ratio, protonation levels of O atoms, and ligands from previously reported 24-nuclear CeOCs. Furthermore, various techniques were employed to investigate the formation process of these two clusters. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) revealed that the white precipitates formed during the preparation of Ce 14 contain Ce(III) ions, while the reddish-brown precipitates formed during the preparation of Ce 24C contain a mixture of Ce(III) and Ce(IV) ions. These two precipitations were individually dissolved in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF). The evolution of solution color and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra over time revealed the gradual oxidation of partial Ce(III) ions by oxygen in the solution of the white precipitation. As Ce(IV) ions increased in this solution, time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data demonstrated the self-assembly of the Ce 14 clusters after 4 days. In contrast, SAXS data and UV-Vis spectra revealed the rapid assembly of Ce 24C clusters within 2 h due to the initial coexistence of Ce(IV) and Ce(III) ions in the DMF solution of the reddish-brown precipitation. The continued reduction of partial Ce(IV) ions in this solution does not affect Ce 24C clusters’ formation and stability. Our studies expand the family of CeOCs and enhance our understanding of the effects of cerium’s oxidation states on cluster formation.
