Abstract The development of bifunctional, non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through morphology and electronic engineering is highly attractive for efficient water splitting. Herein, hierarchical nanoarrays consisting of crystalline cobalt phosphide nanorods covered by amorphous Fe‐doped cobalt phosphide nanocuboids (CoP/FeCoP x ) are constructed as bifunctional catalysts for both HER and OER. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the catalysts exhibit balanced dual‐catalytic properties due to simultaneous introduction of Fe doping and phosphorus vacancies, leading to an optimized electronic structure of the CoP/FeCoP x . Furthermore, the hierarchical nanoarrays made of crystalline/amorphous heterostructures significantly enhance the performance of the electrocatalysts. As a result, the CoP/FeCoP x catalyst demonstrates remarkable performance in both HER and OER, with overpotentials of 74 and 237 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH, respectively, as well as a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm −2 for alkaline overall water splitting. This work integrates the morphology engineering involving design of hierarchical crystalline/amorphous nanoarrays and the electronic engineering through Fe doping and phosphorus vacancies for efficient water electrolysis. It may open a new route toward rational design and feasible fabrication of high‐performance, multifunctional, non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

Abstract In recent years, catalysts based on transition metal sulfides have garnered extensive attention due to their low cost and excellent electrocatalytic activity in the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. Here, the preparation of Fe‐doped Ni 3 S 2 via a one‐step hydrothermal approach is reported by utilizing inexpensive transition metals Ni and Fe. In an alkaline medium, Fe–Ni 3 S 2 exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability for the OER, and the current density can reach 10 mA cm −2 with an overpotential of 163 mV. In addition, Pt/C||Fe–Ni 3 S 2 is used as the membrane electrode of the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, which is capable of providing a current density of 650 mA cm −2 at a cell voltage of 2.0 V, outperforming the benchmark Ir/C. The principle is revealed that the doping of Fe enhances the electrocatalytic water decomposition ability of Ni 3 S 2 by in situ Raman and in situ X‐ray absorption fine structure. The results indicate that the doping of Fe decreases the charge density near Ni atoms, which renders Fe–Ni 3 S 2 more favorable for the adsorption of OH − and the formation of * OO − intermediates. This work puts forward an effective strategy to significantly improve both the alkaline OER activity and stability of low‐cost electrocatalysts.

A Z-scheme heterojunction photo(electro)catalyst was fabricated by coupling sulfonic acid-modified graphitic carbon nitride (SA-g-CN) with bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI). The SA-g-CN component was prepared via wet-impregnation, while BiOI was synthesized through a hydrothermal method. Comprehensive characterization elucidated the structural and morphological properties of the resulting composite. The SA-g-CN/BiOI exhibited exceptional performance in both photocatalytic degradation of tartrazine (TTZ) and photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, 98.26% TTZ removal was achieved within 60 min of irradiation, while an OER onset potential of 0.94 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and a high photocurrent density of 6.04 mA were recorded under AM 1.5G illumination. Band energy calculations based on Mott–Schottky measurements confirmed the formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction, which facilitated efficient charge separation and transfer, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. These findings establish the SA-g-CN/BiOI composite as a promising candidate for sustainable energy generation and environmental remediation applications.

Enabling high‐efficiency solar thermal conversion (STC) at catalytic active site is critical but challenging for harnessing solar energy to boost catalytic reactions. Herein, we report the direct integration of full‐spectrum STC and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene‐encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle. This catalyst exhibits a near‐complete 98% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97%, which is superior than previous solar thermal catalytic materials. It delivers a remarkable potential decrease of over 240 mV at various current densities for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination, which is practically unachievable via traditionally heating the system. The high‐efficiency STC is enabled by a synergy between the regulated electronic structure of graphene via CoNi‐carbon interaction and the multiple absorption of lights by the light‐trapping nanocage. Theoretical calculations suggest that high temperature‐induced vibrational free energy gain promotes the potential‐limiting O* to OOH* step, which decreases the overpotential for oxygen evolution.

Non‐iridium acid‐stabilized electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a strategy to modulate the stability of RuO2 by doping boron (B) atoms, leading to the preparation of a RuO2 catalyst with long‐range disorder (LD‐B/RuO2). The structure of long‐range disorder endowed LD‐B/RuO2 with a low overpotential of 175 mV and an ultra‐long stability, which can maintain OER for about 1.6 months at 10 mA cm‐2 current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 with almost invariable performance. More importantly, a PEM electrolyzer using LD‐B/RuO2 as the anode demonstrated excellent performance, reaching 1000 mA cm−2 at 1.63 V with durability exceeding 300 h at 250 mA cm−2 current density. The introduction of B atoms induced the formation of a long‐range disordered structure and symmetry‐breaking B‐Ru‐O motifs, which enabled the catalyst structure to a certain toughness while simultaneously inducing the redistribution of electrons on the active center Ru, which jointly promoted and guaranteed the activity and long‐term stability of LD‐B/RuO2. This study provides a strategy to prepare long‐range disordered RuO2 acidic OER catalysts with high stability using B‐doping to perturb crystallinity, which opens potential possibilities for non‐iridium‐based PEMWE applications.

Abstract Despite considerable efforts to develop electrolyzers for energy conversion, progress has been hindered during the implementation stage by different catalyst development requirements in academic and industrial research. Herein, a coherent workflow for the efficient transition of electrocatalysts from basic research to application readiness for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction is proposed. To demonstrate this research approach, La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 is selected as a catalyst, and its electrocatalytic performance is compared with that of the benchmark material NiFe 2 O 4 . The La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 catalyst with the desired dispersity is successfully synthesized by scalable spray‐flame synthesis. Subsequently, inks are formulated using different binders (Nafion®, Naf; Sustainion®, Sus), and nickel substrates are spray coated, ensuring a homogeneous catalyst distribution. Extensive electrochemical evaluations, including several scale‐bridging techniques, highlight the efficiency of the La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 catalyst. Experiments using the scanning droplet cell (SDC) indicate good lateral homogeneity for La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 electrodes and NiFe 2 O 4 ‐Sus, while the NiFe 2 O 4 ‐Naf film suffers from delamination. Among the various half‐cell techniques, SDC proves to be a valuable tool to quickly check whether a catalyst layer is suitable for full‐cell‐level testing and will be used for the fast‐tracking of catalysts in the future. Complementary compression and flow cell experiments provide valuable information on the electrodes' behavior upon exposure to chemical and mechanical stress. Finally, parameters and conditions simulating industrial settings are applied using a zero‐gap cell. Findings from various research fields across different scales obtained based on the developed coherent workflow contribute to a better understanding of the electrocatalytic system at the early stages of development and provide important insights for the evaluation of novel materials that are to be used in large‐scale industrial applications.

Abstract Efficient electrocatalysis at the cathode is crucial to addressing the limited stability and low rate capability of Li−O 2 batteries. This study examines the kinetic behavior of Li−O 2 batteries utilizing layered perovskite LaSrCrO 4 nanowires (NWs) composed of lower oxidation states. Layered perovskite LaSrCrO 4 NWs exhibited improved rate capability over a wide range of current densities and longer cycle life in Li−O 2 batteries than V‐based layered perovskite (LaSrVO 4 ) and simple perovskite (La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CrO 3 ) NWs. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical surface area analyses showed that the observed performance variations primarily stemmed from active sites such as oxygen vacancies. In situ Raman analysis showed that these active sites significantly modulate the kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution, which are related to LiO 2 intermediate adsorption. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the active sites in layered perovskite LaSrCrO 4 NWs contributed to their high charge transfer capability and reduced polarization. This study presents an appealing method for the precise fabrication and analysis of Cr‐based layered perovskites, aimed at achieving highly efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.

Abstract Efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts play a pivotal role in water electrolysis, notably for industrial high current densities (>1000 mA cm −2 ). Crystalline/amorphous heterostructure interfaces have proven to be advantageous for enhancing the OER activities of electrocatalytic materials. However, the constructing and tailoring for crystalline/amorphous interfaces still remain a great challenge due to the destruction of active substrates by intricate post‐treatment. Here, a strategy to tailor nanocrystalline/amorphous (N/A) interface and optimize the electrocatalytic performance of as‐cast N/A alloys by adjusting the size of nanocrystals is proposed. The N/A alloy fibers obtained based on this strategy exhibit superior OER performance with an overpotential of 227 mV (@10 mA cm −2 ), maintaining stability for over 1000, 600, and 240 h under high current densities of 500, 1000, and 1800 mA cm −2 , respectively. Theoretical calculations and material characterizations reveal that N/A interfaces, facilitated by appropriately sized nanocrystals possessing a loose atomic arrangement, favorable surface electronic structure, advantageous local coordination, and optimal O‐contained intermediate adsorption, can yield abundant active sites without compromising stability. This study not only provides a deeper understanding of the tailoring mechanism of N/A interfaces but also offers a new design perspective for the development of cost‐effective, industrial‐grade electrocatalysts.

Abstract This paper uses a common one-step hydrothermal method to prepare NiMn-LDH/NF (Layered Double Hydroxide, LDH) oxygen evolution catalyst with outstanding performance. The NiMn-LDH grows into a nanosheet array structure on nickel foam (NF) and it has a big surface area and exceptional ion transport function that could accelerate the diffusion rate of electrocatalytic products. It attempted to modulate the molar proportion of Ni and Mn to explore the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the NiMn-LDH/NF catalysts. It was found that when Ni:Mn=4:1 (molar ratio, hereinafter), the nanosheets grew more densely and had better OER performance and stability. The electrochemical test results show that the Ni 4 Mn-LDH/NF catalyst exhibits an overvoltage of 341 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and the Tafel slope is only 98.99 mV dec −1 .

The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be combined with various reactions to fabricate electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices while the slow kinetics and poor mass transfer capability at high current densities were the key constraints to its large‐scale application. Therefore, this review primarily focuses on design and optimization of mass transfer structures of TM‐metal‐based OER catalysts. Nanostructuring, porous design, and the creation of hierarchical architectures have been applied during catalyst synthesis to enhance the surface area and accessibility, thereby improving mass transfer and catalytic OER efficiency. Strategies including doping, substrate invitation, soft/hard templating has been utilized to accelerate mass transfer as well as the ion/electron conduction efficiency for the overall improvement of OER performance of the catalysts. These developments underline the critical role of advanced material design in achieving high‐performance OER catalysts and highlight the potential of TM‐based materials in cost‐effective and scalable applications.

In this paper, iron phthalocyanine nanowires on a nickel foam (FePc@NF) composite catalyst were prepared by a facile solvothermal approach. The catalyst showed good electrochemical oxygen evolution performance. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, 289 mV low overpotential and 49.9 mV dec−1 Tafel slope were seen at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The excellent electrochemical performance comes from the homogeneous dispersion of phthalocyanine nanostructures on the surface of the nickel foam, which avoids the common agglomeration problem of such catalysts and provides a large number of active sites for the OER reaction, thus improving the catalytic performance of the system.

Abstract The rational construction of a hierarchical noble metal–metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) structure is anticipated to yield enduring and highly efficient performance in alkaline electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a sandwich construction strategy is employed to enhance the stability, wherein active RutheniRu (Ru) nanosheets are incorporated onto nickel foam (NF) and subsequently covered with porphyrinic MOFs (PMOFs). In addition, activated PMOF‐NiOOH‐Ru 20 /NF‐C/A electrodes are obtained by electrochemical self‐reconstruction as cathode and anode, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the resulting PMOF‐NiOOH‐Ru heterointerface effectively facilitated electron transfer, enhanced H 2 O adsorption capacity, and optimized Δ G values for * H and * O to * OOH. Consequently, PMOF‐NiOOH‐Ru 20 /NF‐C/A exhibited low overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), accompanied by minimal Ru leakage. Furthermore, stable overall water splitting can be achieved with a low voltage of 1.456 V@10 mA cm −2 for over 120 h. Even when operated in simulated seawater, the prepared electrodes demonstrated similar activity and stability. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the regulation mechanism for the performance and stability of active sites in the electrocatalytic self‐reconstruction process.

Water electrolysis using renewable electricity is a promising strategy for high‐purity hydrogen production. To realize the practical application of water electrolysis, an electrocatalyst with high redox properties and low cost is essential for enhancing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, we fabricated Fe‐doped nickel oxalate (Fe‐NiC 2 O 4 ) directly grown on nickel (Ni) foam as an efficient electrocatalyst for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction using a facile one‐step hydrothermal method. Fe‐NiC 2 O 4 served as a precursor for obtaining highly active Fe‐doped Ni oxyhydroxide (Fe‐NiOOH) via in situ electrochemical oxidation. Consequently, 0.75Fe‐NiOOH was demonstrated to be the optimal electrocatalyst, exhibiting outstanding oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 20.5 mV dec −1 . Furthermore, Fe‐NiOOH maintained its oxygen evolution reaction activity without performance decay during long‐term electrochemical measurements, owing to the phase transformation from nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) to γ‐NiOOH (gamma nickel oxyhydroxide). These performances significantly surpass those of recently reported transition‐metal‐based electrocatalysts.

Abstract The ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) has attracted attention because ethylene glycol (EG), which exhibits large‐scale production and a low market price, can be reformed into valuable glycolic acid (GCA) with the cogeneration of high‐purity hydrogen gas during the reaction. In this study, a noble catalyst material of Pt nanoparticles supported on Se‐doped porous carbon (Pt/SePC) is prepared and investigated for the selective electrochemical oxidation of EG to GCA. Pt/SePC achieved a maximum EG conversion of 94.6% and GCA selectivity of 84.4% and maintained this high performance with negligible degradation during durability tests. Furthermore, the EGOR required lower overpotential rather than the oxygen evolution reaction, thus the EGOR coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction can reduce the cell overpotential to 0.60 V, which is much lower than that of water electrolysis (1.58 V). The effect of Se doping is investigated through experimental analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and they shows that Se modified the binding energy of Pt nanoparticles and the adsorption energy of reactants by lattice deformation and charge density modification. This study provides scientific insights and strategies for electrocatalyst design for the selective oxidation of polyols to value‐added chemicals via the cogeneration of hydrogen gas.

Abstract Under large current densities, the excessive hydroxide ion (OH) consumption hampers alkaline water splitting involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High OH concentration (≈30 wt.%) is often used to enhance the catalytic activity of OER, but it also leads to higher corrosion in practical systems. To achieve higher catalytic activity in low OH concentration, catalysts on magnetic frame (CMF) are built to utilize the local magnetic convection induced from the host frame's magnetic field distributions. This way, a higher reaction rate can be achieved in relatively lower OH concentrations. A CMF model system with catalytically active CoFeO x nanograins grown on the magnetic Ni foam is demonstrated. The OER current of CoFeO x @NF receives ≈90% enhancement under 400 mT (900 mA cm −2 at 1.65 V) compared to that in zero field, and exhibits remarkable durability over 120 h. As a demonstration, the water‐splitting performance sees a maximum 45% magnetic enhancement under 400 mT in 1 m KOH (700 mA cm −2 at 2.4 V), equivalent to the concentration enhancement of the same electrode in a more corrosive 2 m KOH electrolyte. Therefore, the catalyst‐on‐magnetic‐frame strategy can make efficient use of the catalysts and achieve higher catalytic activity in low OH concentration by harvesting local magnetic convection.

The surface engineering of electrocatalysts is one of the promising strategies to increase the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts. It generates anion/cation vacancy defects and increases the electrochemically active surface area. We describe the surface engineering of Ni2P to favorably tune the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity and the development of a rechargeable zinc‐air battery (ZAB). Ni2P encapsulated with N and P‐dual doped carbon (Ni2P@NPC) is synthesized using a single‐source precursor complex tris‐(2,2'‐bipyridine)nickel(II) bis(hexafluorophosphate). The surface engineering of the as‐synthesized Ni2P@NPC is achieved by the controlled acid treatment at room temperature. The surface engineering removes carbon debris and opens the pores, exfoliates the encapsulating carbon layer, increases the P‐vacancy in the crystal lattice, and boosts the electrochemically active surface area. The surface‐engineered catalyst exhibits enhanced bifunctional activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytically active sites of engineered catalysts are highly accessible for facilitated electron transfer kinetics. P‐vacancy favors the facile formation of defect‐rich OER active metal oxyhydroxide species. The rechargeable ZAB based on the engineered catalyst delivers a specific capacity of 770.25 mA h gZn‐1, energy density of 692 Wh kgZn‐1, and excellent charge‐discharge cycling performance with negligible voltaic efficiency loss (0.6 %) after 100 h.

Abstract Heterostructures of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and MXenes have shown great promise for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, owing to their complementary physical properties. Coupling LDHs with MXenes can potentially enhance their conductivity, stability, and OER activity. In this work, a scalable and straightforward in situ guided growth of CoFeLDH on Ti 3 C 2 T x is introduced, where the surface chemistry of Ti 3 C 2 T x dominates the resulting heterostructures, allowing tunable crystal domain sizes of LDHs. Combined simulation results of Monte Carlo and density functional theory (DFT) validate this guided growth mechanism. Through this way, the optimized heterostructures allow the highest OER activity of the overpotential = 301 mV and Tafel slope = 43 mV dec −1 at 10 mA cm −2 , and a considerably durable stability of 0.1% decay over 200 h use, remarkably outperforming all reported LDHs‐MXenes materials. DFT calculations indicate that the charge transfer in heterostructures can decrease the rate‐limiting energy barrier for OER, facilitating OER activity. The combined experimental and theoretical efforts identify the participation role of MXene in heterostructures for OER reactions, providing insights into designing advanced heterostructures for robust OER electrocatalysis.

Abstract Successful separation of photoexcited charge carriers and their effective utilization are crucial for overcoming the slow kinetics of the four-electron process for photocatalytic oxygen evolution. Herein, a novel strategy utilizing urea as a source of N-doping on Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets is adopted followed by the successful deposition of Co single atoms (Co-SAs) to achieve a synergistic effect. The presence of N-dopants and Co-SAs is validated via various experimental techniques. Besides, it is observed that the presence of N-doping contributed towards deposition of higher content of Co-SAs (0.21 wt%) in Ca2Nb3O10-xNx¬-CoSA nanosheets compared to 0.15 wt% for non-doped Ca2Nb3O10-CoSA. The optimized Ca2Nb3O10-xNx-CoSA nanosheets exhibited an impressive photocatalytic O2 evolution of ~727.22 µmol g-1 h-1 via the synergy of N-dopants and Co-SAs. As a result, O2 evolution response of Ca2Nb3O10-xNx-CoSA is 3.6 times higher than pristine Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets (201.26 µmol g-1 h-1), 2.24 times better than Ca2Nb3O10-xNx nanosheets (323.42 µmol g-1 h-1), and 1.77 times higher compared to Ca2Nb3O10-CoSA, (409.33 µmol g-1 h-1), clearly demonstrated the synergistic effect of N-dopants and Co-SAs in Ca2Nb3O10-xNx-CoSA nanosheets. Base on the finding of various characterization techniques, the co-presence of N-dopants and Co-SAs is observed to contribute towards better charge carriers separation, and utilization to achieve superior photocatalytic response. Thus, this work presents a novel approach for incorporating N-dopants and Co-SAs on Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets which can be extended to wide range of nanosheets produced by the soft chemical exfoliation method.

Active oxygen species (OH*/O*) derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds into high‐value chemicals, which can determine activity and selectivity, whereas the relationship between them remains unclear. Herein, using glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation as a model reaction, we systematically investigated the relationship between GLY oxidation activity and the formation energy of OH* (ΔGOH*). We first identified that OH* on Au demonstrates the highest activity for GLY electrooxidation among various pure metals, based on experiments and density functional theory, and revealed that ΔGOH* on Au‐based alloys is influenced by the metallic composition of OH* coordination sites. Moreover, we observed a linear correlation between the adsorption energy of GLY (Eads) and the d‐band center of Au‐based alloys. Comprehensive microkinetic analysis further reveals a volcano relationship between GLY oxidation activity, the ΔGOH* and the adsorption free energy of GLY (ΔGads). Notably, Au3Pd and Au3Ag alloys, positioned near the peak of the volcano plot, show excellent activity, attributed to their moderate ΔGOH* and ΔGads, striking a balance that is neither too high nor too low. This research provides theoretical insights into modulating active oxygen species from water electrolysis to enhance organic electrooxidation reactions.

Comprehensive microkinetic analysis further reveals a volcano relationship between GLY oxidation activity, the ΔGOH* and the adsorption free energy of GLY (ΔGads). Notably, Au3Pd and Au3Ag alloys, positioned near the peak of the volcano plot, show excellent activity, attributed to their moderate ΔGOH* and ΔGads, striking a balance that is neither too high nor too low. This research provides theoretical insights into modulating active oxygen species from water electrolysis to enhance organic electrooxidation reactions.

Abstract Transition metal chalcogenides are an important class of electrocatalysts with broad application prospects in alkaline oxygen evolution reactions. Many researchers are focusing on the in situ conversion of metal cations in catalysts, but have rarely considered the contribution of oxidation, leaching, and re‐absorption of chalcogenides to the catalytic activity. Herein, multiple characterization approaches are used to monitor the evolution mechanism and origin CoTe@CoS‐electrocatalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The research results reveal that the electro‐oxidative dissolution of Te and S on the electrode surface forms TeO 3 2− and SO 3 2− , which are adsorbed on the electrode surface. Moreover, TeO 3 2− and SO 3 2− species will further transform into TeO 4 2− and SO 4 2− . As expected, the extra addition of mixed tellurite and sulfate ions to the Co (OH) 2 electrolyte produces a synergistic effect that can significantly boost OER activity. Selenites reveal the analogous effect, indicating that the adsorption of chalcogenates the electrode surface has a universal effect on improving OER performance. The findings of this work provide unique insights into the species conversion of catalytic materials and the mechanism of enhancing catalytic activity during OER processes.

We present the results of a comprehensive theoretical investigation, based on state-of-the-art density functional theory simulations, of the structural and electrochemical properties of amorphous pristine and iron-doped nickel-(oxy)hydroxide catalyst films for water oxidation in alkaline solution, hereafter referred to as NiCat and Fe:NiCat. In the case of the structural properties, our simulations accurately reproduce the structural changes occurring in locally ordered units, reported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements when the catalyst films are activated by exposition to a positive potential. We have highlighted the crucial role in this process of a series of proton- coupled electron transfer events in the reversible oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III). Once assessed structural models of NiCat and Fe:NiCat in close agreement with experimental results, we used them to investigate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) atomistic mechanism, activated when the applied potential exceeds the overpotential required to oxidize water and produce molecular oxygen. We have quantitatively compared seven different pathways for the OER enrolled on both the proposed families of reaction mechanisms, namely the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the lattice-oxygen mediate mechanism (LOM), and we have rationalized the effect of iron in the huge enhancement of catalytic activity of Fe:NiCat with respect to NiCat. Regarding the competition between AEM and LOM mechanisms, our results support the idea that simple metal- oxygen-metal atomistic motifs, ubiquitous on the surface of all kinds of crystalline and amorphous metal (oxy)hydroxide catalyst films, are able to promote different mechanisms of both types, all compatible with the application of an external positive potential in the range of those used in real electrochemical devices performing the OER. Finally, our results suggest that the elusive role of iron is related to the significant difference between Ni(IV)-O and Fe(IV)-O bonds in two crucial reaction intermediates immediately preceding the formation of the O-O bond, with Fe ions able to lower the potential required to form such intermediates along most of the investigated reaction paths.

Abstract Strategies to control the size, shape, and lattice arrangement, introduce doping agents, and induce heterostructuring in electrocatalysts are strongly desirable to tailor their activities. Herewith, a one‐pot strategy utilizing polyacryloyl hydrazide (PAHz) as the composition directing agent and metallic Ni surface as the shape directing agent is employed to grow Co 3 O 4 doped NiCu alloy nanocuboids on Ni foam (NF) under hydrothermal conditions for electrocatalytic H 2 production. The resulting bi‐functional electrodes are suitable for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) coupled green H 2 production with effective energy efficiency. The low overall potential (MOR+HER) of 1.78 V to realize the current density ( j ) value of 100 mA cm −2 and extended durability (100 h@10 mA cm −2 ) along with the selective conversion of methanol to formate support the viability of the NF‐PAHz‐Co 3 O 4 @NiCu for the said operation. The electrode also displays efficacy toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and j OER value of 100 mA cm −2 is realized at a potential value of 1.65 V RHE with adequate durability. Overall, the synthetic strategy is general, scalable and may be extended to grow other metal oxide doped alloy nanostructures in the future.

Sunlight has long served as primary energy source on our planet, shaping the behavior of living organisms. Extensive research has been dedicated to unraveling the evolutionary pathways involved. When the formation of Earth atmosphere, it primarily consisted of small gas molecules, which are considered crucial for the emergence of life. Recent demonstrations have shown that these molecules can also be transformed into semiconductors, with the potential to harness solar energy and catalyze chemical reactions as photocatalysts. Building upon this research, this minireview focuses on the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. Initially, it examines key reactions, such as the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, various C‐N complexes in photocatalysts are explored, showcasing their roles in catalyzing chemical reactions. The conclusion and outlook provide a potential pathway for the evolution of Earth, shedding light on the significance of metal‐free photocatalysts in development of Earth.

We investigate the time evolution of ZnO thin film growth in oxygen plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry. The recently proposed dynamic-dual-box-model approach [Kilic et al., Sci. Rep. 10, 10392 (2020)] is used to analyze the spectroscopic data post-growth. With the help of this model, we explore the in-cycle surface modifications and reveal the repetitive layer-by-layer growth and surface roughness modification mechanisms during the ZnO ultrathin film deposition. The in situ complex-valued dielectric function of the amorphous ZnO thin film is also determined from the model analysis for photon energies of 1.7–4 eV. The dielectric function is analyzed using a critical point model approach providing parameters for bandgap energy, amplitude, and broadening in addition to the index of refraction and extinction coefficient. The dynamic-dual-box-model analysis reveals the initial nucleation phase where the surface roughness changes due to nucleation and island growth prior to film coalescence, which then lead to the surface conformal layer-by-layer growth with constant surface roughness. The thickness evolution is resolved with Angstrom-scale resolution vs time. We propose this method for fast development of growth recipes from real-time in situ data analysis. We also present and discuss results from x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy to examine crystallographic, chemical, and morphological characteristics of the ZnO film.

Abstract Cyanobacteria intricately regulate their metabolic pathways during the diurnal cycle to ensure survival and growth. Under dark conditions, the breakdown of glycogen, an energy reserve, in these organisms replenishes Calvin cycle intermediates, especially downstream glycolytic metabolites, which are necessary for photosynthesis initiation upon light irradiation. However, it remains unclear how the accumulation of these intermediates is maintained in the dark despite limited glycogen availability. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the regulation of downstream glycolytic metabolites of the Calvin cycle under dark and light treatment using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our results showed that during the dark period, low pyruvate kinase (Pyk) activity ensured metabolite accumulation, while endogenous Pyk overexpression significantly lowered the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. Remarkably, wild type Synechocystis maintained oxygen evolution ability throughout dark treatment for over 2 d, while Pyk overexpression resulted in decreased oxygen evolution after 16 h of dark treatment. These results indicated that limiting Pyk activity via darkness treatment facilitates photosynthetic initiation by maintaining glycolytic intermediates. Similarly, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PepC) overexpression decreased oxygen evolution under dark treatment; however, its effect was lower than that of Pyk. Further, we noted that as PepC overexpression decreased the levels of glycolytic intermediates in the dark, sugar phosphates in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle showed high accumulation, suggesting that sugar phosphates play important roles in supporting photosynthesis initiation. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of controlling the metabolic pathways through which glycolytic and CBB cycle intermediates are consumed (defined as cataplerosis of CBB cycle) to ensure stable photosynthesis.

Gas bubbles generated by the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction during water electrolysis influence the energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen production. Here, we survey what is known about the interaction of gas bubbles and electrode surfaces and the influence of gas evolution on practicable devices used for water electrolysis. We outline the physical processes occurring during the life cycle of a bubble, summarize techniques used to characterize gas evolution phenomena in situ and in practical device environments, and discuss ways that electrodes can be tailored to facilitate gas removal at high current densities. Lastly, we review efforts to model the behavior of individual gas bubbles and multiphase flows produced at gas-evolving electrodes. We conclude our review with a short summary of outstanding questions that could be answered by future efforts to characterize gas evolution in electrochemical device environments or by improved simulations of multiphase flows.

Abstract The development of highly conjugated metalloporphyrin assemblies is a crucial step to improve their catalytic activity for optimal energy conversion processes. Herein, di‐thienyl substituted nickel(II) porphyrin is used to form a highly conjugated porphyrin structure. The resulting porphyrin‐based conjugated polymer catalyst exhibited exceptional oxygen evolution reaction “OER” performances, featuring a low onset overpotential of 266 mV and high reaction kinetics (Tafel slope of 69.9 mV/dec) under alkaline pH conditions, achieving a current density of 4.5 mA/cm 2 . The remarkable OER catalytic activity of porphyrin‐based conjugated polymer catalyst is attributed to the enhancement of the conjugation, which occurs through a unique process involving direct fusion of the porphyrins followed by thienyl bridging of the fused porphyrin tapes, ultimately leading to the establishment of a highly cross‐linked porphyrinic network.

Hydrogen has the potential to decarbonize the energy and industrial sector in the future, mainly if it is generated by water electrolysis. Proton Exchange Membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) system is regarded as a propitious technology to produce green hydrogen from water using power supplied by renewable energy sources. It offers many benefits such as high performance, high proton conductibility, quick response, compact size, and low working temperature. Many conceptual and functional parameters influence the effectiveness of PEM, including temperature, pressure of anode and cathode regions, water content and wideness of layer, and cathode and anode exchange current density. In addition, the anodic half reaction (known as oxygen evolution reaction (OER)), and cathodic half reaction (known as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) perform an important function in the development of PEMWE. The current paper aims at presenting these parameters and discussing their impacts on the performance of PEM. Also, the PEM efficiency is presented. The different methods used to enhance the scattering of OER electrocatalyst and minimizing catalyst loading to minimize the price of PEMWE are also highlighted. Moreover, the alternative of noble metals that could be used as electrocatalyst in HER and OER to minimize the cost of PEM are reviewed and presented.

Developing efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the performance of rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). In this study, cobalt/cobalt oxides embedded in N-doped carbon nanofibers (Co/CoOx/NCNFs) were synthesized through a combination of electrospinning and annealing processes. The resulting Co/CoOx/NCNFs catalysts feature abundant CoNx and CoOx active species, leveraging the large specific surface area of nanofibers to facilitate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized Co/CoOx/NCNFs-0.1 achieved a half-wave potential (vs. RHE) of 0.82 V and required only 429 mV to reach 10 mA cm⁻² in a typical three-electrode system with 0.1 M KOH using an electrochemical workstation equipped with a pine instruments rotator, outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2. The assembled ZABs exhibited high specific capacity (771 mAh gZn-1), substantial power density (981.6 mWh gZn-1), and long-term stability (>325 h). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the electrocatalytic processes involve the redox activity of Co (II and III) species derived from abundant CoNx and CoOx, elaborating the origin of the catalysts' exceptional oxygen electrocatalysis performance. This work not only presents a straightforward and effective approach for producing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in ZABs but also sheds light on the catalytic mechanisms underlying ORR and OER for CoNx/CoOx-based oxygen electrocatalysts.

Abstract The quest for heightened energy efficiency is inextricably linked to advancements in energy storage and conversion technologies, wherein multifunctional catalysts play a pivotal role by mitigating the slow kinetics endemic to many catalytic reactions. The intricate synthesis and bespoke design of such catalysts, however, present notable challenges. Addressing this, the present study capitalizes on a novel dissolution manufacturing strategy to engineer self‐supporting, nanoporous multifunctional electrocatalysts, circumventing the prevalent issue of customizing catalytic functionalities upon demand. This innovative approach grants the flexibility to finely tune the incorporation of active species and metalloid binders, culminating in the creation of a self‐supporting nanoporous metal glass electrocatalyst doped with RuO 2 (NPMG@RuO 2 ) with outstanding performance in alkaline media. The catalyst showcases superior electrocatalytic activity, achieving low overpotentials of 41.50 mV for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction and 226.0 mV for Oxygen Evolution Reaction alongside sustained stability over 620 hours.These achievements are attributed to the distinct nanoporous architecture that ensures a high density of catalytic sites and mechanical strength, bolstered by the synergistic interplay between RuO 2 and Pt‐based metallic glass. The findings provide a versatile template for the development of nanoporous multifunctional catalysts, signifying a leap forward in the realm of energy conversion technologies.

Abstract In order to address imminent energy and environmental challenges, photocatalytic water splitting emerges as a promising way for harnessing solar radiation to generate clean chemical energy. 2D arsenene (β‐As) has notable catalytic activity in hydrogen production. Based on first principles calculations and non‐adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations, the β‐As/Ti 2 CO 2 heterojunction is predicted to be a promising Z‐scheme photocatalyst for overall solar water splitting. It has a desirable energy band structure with the valence band maximum of Ti 2 CO 2 and the conduction band minimum of β‐As well below and above the redox potentials of H 2 O. Both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can proceed spontaneously under light irradiation. NAMD simulations confirm that it is a Z‐scheme photocatalyst with fast electron–hole combination dynamics. Instead of by intrinsic electric field, such a fast electron–hole combination is driven by a large nonadiabatic coupling. The heterojunction exhibits strong optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet regions. The estimated solar‐to‐hydrogen (STH) efficiency limit of β‐As/Ti 2 CO 2 reaches 32%, which is the highest among all β‐As based junctions reported in the literature. These results suggest that β‐As/Ti 2 CO 2 is a promising photocatalyst for achieving overall water splitting.

Hydrogen energy, a clean and sustainable energy source, has received much attention recently. Water electrolysis combines the cathode’s hydrogen evolution process with the anode’s oxygen evolution reaction, which is a potential approach for producing hydrogen. High-grade energy is needed for advanced solar energy utilization technology such as electrolysis to provide the most compact, and efficient application. Electrical and thermal energy needs may be satisfied by concentrated solar power (CSP) technology. Utilizing CSP technology with parabolic reflectors has several advantages, including a proven track record of financial return on investment, a well-developed technology, and simplicity of integration with other renewable energy sources or fossil fuels. Given the world’s current environmental status and the continuing degradation of fossil fuel supplies, the direct use of potable water as a medium for hydrogen synthesis has emerged as a hot research issue. Because of its availability in the Philippines and how it can be produced by desalinating seawater, immediate use of potable water as the medium for water electrolysis can minimize the cost of hydrogen generation. Research on yielding hydrogen gas as an alternative energy source by an electrolysis system powered by sun-tracking CSP with parabolic reflectors was thoroughly done to gather data. Results show that green hydrogen gas can indeed be yielded and can be more effective with the use of sun-tracking CSP.

This study reports a combined electrochemical method for preparation of a titanium dioxide–suboxide composite with an electrochemically deposited non-continuous platinum layer on the surface, which can be used for cathodic protection of metal structures. Platinum significantly modifies the properties of TiO2, stabilizes the surface, and prevents the formation of a passive non-conductive layer. The coating has significant advantages compared to Ti/Pt, traditionally used for electrochemical protection, as the platinum content in the composite is significantly reduced. Unlike a continuous precious metal layer, this method of composite formation, particularly thermal treatment in an air atmosphere at 5000C, allows protecting the platinum, which is encapsulated in titanium oxides, and avoiding the creeping passivation typical of traditionally used materials. The surface of the coatings was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray microanalysis. Studies of the electrocatalytic properties, especially concerning the oxygen evolution reaction, revealed deviations of the Tafel slope from the theoretical value, which is explained by structural heterogeneity and the presence of a semiconductor component. The stability and corrosion resistance of the composites were studied. It was found that the properties remain unchanged even after prolonged exposure to a corrosive environment.

Developing efficient and durable electrocatalyst for seawater splitting is crucial in hydrogen production. Herein, a multi-scale design strategy was employed to fabricate ruthenium clusters modification carbon layer-encapsulated nickel-cobalt-phosphorus (Ru/C/NiCoP) nanoneedles electrocatalyst supported on nickel foam (NF). We demonstrated that Ru/C/NiCoP/NF exhibited exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances, with low overpotential, Tafel slope and superior stability. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic mechanism of Ru/C/NiCoP was elucidated through the combination of ex-situ and in-situ characterizations, along with comprehensive electrochemical tests. Strikingly, Ru clusters and the carbon layer engendered robust electronic interaction reaction, accelerated the charge transfer rate, provided more active sites, and enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity, thus substantially promoting the OER kinetics and HER reaction steps as well as stability. In addition, the two-electrode system constructed with Ru/C/NiCoP/NF achieved current density of 10 mA cm-2 in both pure water and seawater at ultra-low potential of 1.46/1.47 V, with Faraday efficiency close to 100%. Even at higher current density of 100 mA cm-2, the required driving voltage remained low at 1.75/1.77 V, maintaining stable operation for 150 h, outperforming most reported non-noble catalysts. This innovative strategy provides facile and versatile approach for developing advanced electrocatalysts in seawater electrolysis application.

Abstract Light‐induced water splitting (hν‐WS) for the production of hydrogen as a solar fuel is considered a promising sustainable strategy for the replacement of fossil fuels. An efficient system for hν‐WS involves a photoactive material that, upon shining light, is capable of separating and transferring charges to catalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution processes. Covalent triazine‐based frameworks (CTFs) represent an interesting class of 2D organic light‐absorbing materials that have recently emerged thanks to their tunable structural, optical and morphological properties. Typically, catalysts (Cat) are metallic nanoparticles generated in situ after photoelectroreduction of metal precursors or directly drop‐casted on top of the CTF material to generate Cat‐CTF assemblies. In this work, the synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic performance of a novel hybrid material, Ru‐CTF , is reported, based on a CTF structure featuring dangling pyridyl groups that allow the Ru‐tda (tda is [2,2′:6′,2′“‐terpyridine]‐6,6′”‐dicarboxylic acid) water oxidation catalyst (WOC) unit to coordinate via covalent bond. The Ru‐CTF molecular hybrid material can carry out the light‐induced water oxidation reaction efficiently at neutral pH, reaching values of maximum TOF of 17 h −1 and TONs in the range of 220 using sodium persulfate as a sacrificial electron acceptor.

Abstract Aim Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is one of the nitrogen sources for microalgal cultivation. An excessive amounts of NH4Cl are toxic for microalgae. However, combining mixotrophic conditions and excessive quantities of NH4Cl positively affects microalgal biomass and lipid production. In this study, we investigated the impact of NH4Cl on the growth, biomass, and triglyceride (TAG) content of the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii especially under mixotrophic condition. Methods and Results Under photoautotrophic conditions (without organic carbon supplementation), adding 25 mM NH4Cl had no significant effect on microalgal growth or TAG content. However, under mixotrophic condition (with acetate supplementation), NH4Cl interfered with microalgal growth while inducing TAG content. To explore these effects further, we conducted a two-step cultivation process and found that NH4Cl reduced microalgal growth, but induced total lipid and TAG content, especially after 4-day cultivation. The photosynthesis performances showed that NH4Cl completely inhibited oxygen evolution on Day 4. However, NH4Cl slightly reduced the Fv/Fm ratio indicating that the NH4Cl supplementation directly affects microalgal photosynthesis. To investigate the TAG induction effect by NH4Cl, we compared the protein expression profiles of microalgae grown mixotrophically with and without 25 mM NH4Cl using a proteomics approach. This analysis identified 1,782 proteins, with putative acetate uptake transporter GFY5 and Acyl-coenzyme A oxidase being overexpressed in the NH4Cl-treated group. Conclusion These findings suggested that NH4Cl supplementation may stimulate acetate utilization and fatty acid synthesis pathways in microalgae cells. Our study indicated that NH4Cl supplementation can induce microalgal biomass and lipid production, particularly when combined with mixotrophic conditions.

The integration of niobium (Nb) into emerging superconducting circuits can enhance their performance and function. However, growth of high purity Nb can be challenging due to its high reactivity with oxygen. Here, we examine the role of residual oxygen inside the growth chamber in transforming the structural, chemical, and superconducting properties of Nb films. We demonstrate that an increase in unintentional oxygen impurities lowers the superconducting critical temperature of Nb. This evolution coincides with the reduction of Nb crystal domains, which are separated by highly disordered oxygen-rich regions. Moreover, chemical analysis reveals the formation of niobium monoxide within the film during growth. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of how residual oxygen in the growth chamber can affect the properties of the Nb films. This study contributes to the materials science and engineering knowledge of superconducting Nb growth.

Petroleum reserves are increasingly depleting, causing a scarcity of petroleum fuel caused by the rapid progress of transportation and the manufacturing industry. This condition forces researchers to search for and develop new renewable energy source. The purpose of research is to understanding and determines role of north-south (U-S) and south-south (S-S) magnetic fields to blend waste cooking oil biodiesel-ethanol on flame evolution, flue gas emissions, and temperature during droplet combustion. Waste cooking oil biodiesel and ethanol were used in this research by adding variations in the direction of repulsive and attractive magnetic fields with an intensity of 11000 gauss. Diameter of droplets tested was 0.3 mm and was placed on a type K thermocouple wire with diameter of 0.1 mm. This research found the role of attractive magnetic field (U-S) in blend waste cooking oil biodiesel-ethanol 20% to produce the shortest flame evolution of 704 ms, lowest CO of 165 ppm, and highest temperature of 828.5 oC. This happens because ethanol has a low flash point and large oxygen content, causing the combustion reaction to occur rapidly. The attractive of magnetic field (U-S) plays a role on attracting oxygen around flame to enter combustion reaction, while the H2O resulting from combustion is pumped out of flame.

Abstract Lithium–oxygen (Li–O 2 ) batteries are an emerging energy storage alternative with the potential to meet the recent increase in demand for high‐energy‐density batteries. From a practical viewpoint, lithium–air (Li–Air) batteries using ambient air instead of pure oxygen could be the final goal. However, the slow oxygen reduction and evolution reactions interfere with reversible cell operation during cycling. Therefore, research continues to explore various catalyst materials. The present study attempts to improve the performance of Li–Air batteries by using porphyrin‐based materials known to have catalytic effects in Li–O 2 batteries. The results confirm that the iron phthalocyanine (FePc) catalyst not only exhibits a catalytic effect in an air atmosphere with a low oxygen fraction but also suppresses electrolyte decomposition by stabilizing superoxide radical ions (O 2 − ) at a high voltage range. Density functional theory calculations are used to gain insight into the exact FePc‐mediated catalytic mechanism in Li–Air batteries, and various ex situ and in situ analyses reveal the reversible reactions and structural changes in FePc during electrochemical reaction. This study provides a practical solution to ultimately realize an air‐breathing battery using nature‐friendly catalyst materials.

Abstract Piezocatalytic water‐splitting to simultaneously produce H 2 and H 2 O 2 has many potential advantages. However, the necessity to utilize materials having polar structures limits the choice of piezocatalysts. Herein, it is demonstrated that centrosymmetric BiOBr with oxygen defects can simultaneously produce H 2 and H 2 O 2 with ultrahigh efficiencies from pure and seawater without needing assistance from noble metals or scavengers. High‐pressure studies confirm that there are no non‐polar‐to‐polar phase transitions in BiOBr, though a novel isostructural phase is discovered. Computational studies reveal that oxygen vacancy distorts the BiOBr structure to induce charge‐localization and polarization. Furthermore, high pressure (i) reduces carrier effective masses and (ii) increases relative O‐2 p contribution in the valence band maximum to assist catalysis and improve stability. The role of oxygen vacancy is confirmed by changing its concentration, which proportionally affects H 2 evolution. The work paves the way for defect engineering to develop piezocatalysts from a large pool of non‐polar materials.

Microstructure of CaO-SiO2-based glassy samples with various Al2O3 contents were examined quantitatively by Raman spectroscopy and 27Al MAS NMR (magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance). Sequence of multiple cluster models of aluminosilicate system modified with Ca2+ and Na+ cations have been designed, and Raman spectra simulation were carried out after geometric optimisation by quantum chemistry (QC) ab initio calculation. The functional relationship between Raman scattering cross-section (RSCS) and stress index of silicon-oxygen tetrahedron (SIT) for aluminosilicates was established, which was applied to the calibration of experimental Raman spectra. Some five-fold coordinated aluminium (AlV, around 5 per cent) and less than 2 per cent six-fold coordinated aluminium (AlVI) were detected by 27Al MAS NMR, while most of aluminium remained in tetrahedral sites (AlIV). The hyperfine quantitative results of Raman spectroscopy and NMR showed a gradually production of AlIV with addition of Al2O3, along with the significant adjustment of Qi species distribution, in which Q1, Q2 reduced and fully polymerised Q4 increased while Q3 showed a non-monotonic variation and obtained the maximum at Al2O3 = 18 mol per cent. Furthermore, the effects of aluminium to bridging oxygen bond types (T-Ob, T = Si, Al) and the degree of polymerisation were also discussed in detail. The evolution of microstructure and its correlation with the viscosity of CaO-SiO2 based melts, incorporating various Al2O3 additives, have been investigated by employing in situ high temperature Raman spectroscopy at 1823 K and viscosity model. These structural features related to composition are essential theoretic foundation to understand their properties. The average Qi evolution culminates in an overall enhancement of the degree of polymerisation. Viscosity was determined utilising a rigorously selected viscosity model, elucidating a consistent upward trajectory as Al2O3 content is incrementally added. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of the relationship between viscosity and structure was conducted based on the average number of non-bridging oxygen per network-forming tetrahedron (NBO/T). It provides valuable insights for examining and predicting viscosity behaviour of aluminosilicate systems.

Ferpesto, an innovation that combines the properties of a pesticide and fertiliser. While the successful Ferpesto 1.0 project was focusing on the growth of the ground plants, we evolved the original Ferpesto to the upgraded version which now focuses on the aquatic plants. This evolution was made as we discovered that the concerns arose regarding eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems due to excessive nitrates. This led to harmful algae blooms depleting oxygen, releasing toxins, and elevating Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). In response, Ferpesto 2.0 prioritises the growth of aquatic plants, aiming to improve water quality by reducing BOD. Expanding on the original formula with watermelon rind, onion peel, fermented rice, and filtered water, Ferpesto 2.0 introduces a key addition which is hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). Observations show that polluted water treated with Ferpesto 2.0 took a longer time to decolorize the methylene blue, indicating the decrease in BOD compared to untreated water. From our survey, individuals that own aquatic ecosystems seek an alternative to maintain the water quality that is both sustainable and affordable. By reusing household wastes, Ferpesto 2.0 contributes to environmentally friendly practices, contributing a healthier and balanced ecosystem for current and future generations.

Ti-added ultra-low carbon (ULC) steel is produced by adding Al and Ti during the secondary refining process to deoxidise molten steel and to bind C and N which are detrimental to the deep drawing quality of the steel product. However, the production of Ti-added ULC steel faces challenges, including submerged entry nozzle clogging and surface defects on cold rolled coils. The troubles were often attributed to ‘Al-Ti complex inclusions’ in the molten steel. However, the evolution of oxide inclusions including their stability has been still unclear. In the present study, the evolution of these inclusions in Ti-added ULC steel was investigated by phase diagram measurement, CALPHAD thermodynamic modelling, high-temperature stability test for the oxides, and observation of transient behaviour of oxide inclusions in the steel. The phase diagram of the Al-Ti-O system was elucidated with an emphasis on oxygen potential, which significantly controls the stability of the oxides. CALPHAD thermodynamic models and a self-consistent database were developed. The transient behaviour of Al-Ti complex inclusions in Ti-added ULC steel was observed in situ using a confocal scanning laser microscope. This was additionally validated by the new thermodynamic model. The equilibrium phases of the oxide inclusions were investigated using a high-temperature resistance furnace, and were analysed using a secondary electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer, and electron back-scattered diffraction. By considering the morphology and crystal structure of these inclusions, the evolution of Al-Ti oxide inclusions was elucidated. Various behaviour of Al-Ti inclusions and their influence on steel cleanliness are discussed.

The phase equilibria in the Al2O3–TiOx system were investigated in wide ranges of temperature and oxygen partial pressure: 1300~1600°C and 10-16.6~10-8 atm, respectively. The equilibrium phases and their compositions were identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), respectively. Most noticeably, a wide range of pseudobrookite solid solution was found in equilibrium with almost pure alumina. At each temperature, the cationic ratio expressed as RTi = nTi/(nAl + nTi)) of the pseudobrookite solid solution showed a noteworthy dependency on the oxygen partial pressure. This resulted in the formation of a broad range of pseudobrookite solid solutions, ranging from Al2TiO5 (RTi = 1/3) to Ti3O5 (RTi = 1.0). Complete miscibility within the pseudobrookite solid solution was observed at 1600°C, with only a minor miscibility gap becoming evident below 1500°C. Based on the results obtained in the present study, the behaviours of Al2TiO5 pseudobrookite have implications in two key domains: (1) understanding changes in the physical properties of the materials, and (2) elucidating the evolution of Al–Ti complex oxide inclusions in liquid steel which can deteriorate the steel cleanliness.

In this paper, we analyze the auto-ignition process of hydrogen in a hot oxidizer stream composed of oxygen–nitrogen and oxygen–water vapor with nitrogen/water vapor mass fractions in a range of 0.1–0.9. The temperature of the oxidizer varies from 1100 K to 1500 K and the temperature of hydrogen is assumed to be 300 K. The research is performed in 1D mixture fraction space and in a forced homogeneous isotropic turbulent (HIT) flow field. In the latter case, the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method combined with the Eulerian Stochastic Field (ESF) combustion model is applied. The results obtained in mixture fraction space aim to determine the most reactive mixture fraction, maximum flame temperature, and dependence on the scalar dissipation rate. Among others, we found that the ignition in H2-O2-H2O mixtures occurs later than in H2-O2-N2 mixtures, especially at low oxidizer temperatures. On the other hand, for a high oxidizer temperature, the ignitability of H2-O2-H2O mixtures is extended, i.e., the ignition occurs for a larger content of H2O and takes place faster. The 3D LES-ESF results show that the ignition time is virtually independent of initial conditions, e.g., randomness of an initial flow field and turbulence intensity. The latter parameter, however, strongly affects the flame evolution. It is shown that the presence of water vapor decreases ignitability and makes flames more prone to extinction.

Abstract Understanding the chemical enrichment of different elements is crucial to gaining a complete picture of galaxy chemical evolution. In this study, we present a new sample of 46 low-redshift, low-mass star-forming galaxies at M * ∼ 10 8−10 M ⊙ along with two quiescent galaxies at M * ∼ 10 8.8 M ⊙ observed with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, aiming to investigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in the transition zone between Local Group satellites and massive field galaxies. We develop a novel method to simultaneously determine stellar abundances of iron and magnesium in star-forming galaxies. With the gas-phase oxygen abundance (O/H) g measured using the strong-line method, we are able to make the first-ever apples-to-apples comparison of α elements in the stars and the interstellar medium. We find that the [Mg/H] * –[O/H] g relation is much tighter than the [Fe/H] * –[O/H] g relation, which can be explained by the similar production processes of α elements. Most galaxies in our sample exhibit higher [O/H] g than [Fe/H] * and [Mg/H] * . In addition, we construct mass–metallicity relations (MZRs) measured as three different elements (Fe * , Mg * , O g ). Compared to the gas O-MZR, the stellar Fe- and Mg-MZRs show larger scatter driven by variations in specific star formation rates (sSFR), with star-forming galaxies exhibiting higher sSFR and lower stellar abundances at fixed mass. The excess of [O/H] g compared to stellar abundances as well as the anticorrelation between sSFR and stellar abundance suggests that galaxy quenching of intermediate-mass galaxies at M * ∼ 10 8−10 M ⊙ is primarily driven by starvation.    

    

## Younger age for the oldest magnetic white dwarfs

Sufficiently old white dwarfs cool down through a convective envelope that directly couples their degenerate cores to the surface. Magnetic fields may inhibit this convection by stiffening the criterion for convective instability. We consistently implemented the modified criterion in the stellar evolution code MESA, and computed the cooling of white dwarfs as a function of their mass and magnetic field $B$. In contrast to previous estimates, we find that magnetic fields can significantly change the cooling time $t$ even if they are relatively weak $B^2\ll 8\pi P$, where $P$ is the pressure at the edge of the degenerate core. Fields $B\gtrsim 1\textrm{ MG}$ open a radiative window that decouples the core from the convective envelope, effectively lowering the luminosity to that of a fully radiative white dwarf. We identified a population of observed white dwarfs that are younger by $\Delta t\sim\textrm{Gyr}$ than currently thought due to this magnetic inhibition of convection - comparable to the cooling delay due to carbon-oxygen phase separation. In volume-limited samples, the frequency and strength of magnetic fields increase with age. Accounting for magnetic inhibition is therefore essential for accurate cooling models for cosmic chronology and for determining the origin of the magnetic fields.

Agriculture, as an important activity on which human beings depend for their livelihood, brings serious environmental problems while meeting the needs of human survival, among which agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution is one of the most urgent environmental problems. This study quantitatively assessed the loading characteristics spatial and temporal evolution patterns of two agricultural NPS pollutants, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), from 2010 to 2020 in the Nansi Lake Basin as an example, and constructed a system dynamics (SD) simulation model to simulate and analyze agricultural NPS pollution under different development and treatment scenarios, based on an investigation of the regional prevention and control strategy of agricultural NPS pollution and the technological system. The results show that the current status of agricultural NPS pollution load in the Nansi Lake Basin is poor, and the level of pollution load is high, showing obvious geographical differences. In terms of temporal changes, the pollution loads of the two pollutants showed a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2020, among which the pollution load of NH3-N showed the largest change. Spatially, the spatial distribution of each type of pollutant has some similarities, with smaller pollution loads in Jining and Zaozhuang and relatively larger pollution loads in Heze and Ningyang. The main source of COD pollution in the Nansi Lake Basin is rural life, with an emission proportion of 52.85%, and the main sources of NH3-N pollution from agricultural NPS pollution in the area are rural life and livestock and poultry farming, with emission proportions of 47.55% and 35.36%, respectively. Under the status quo continuum scenario, the pollution load values for COD are consistently higher than those for NH3-N, so the relative impact of COD is greater. In this study, the principles and methods of SD in system science are adopted to deal with the agricultural NPS pollution of Nansi Lake Basin, and the evolution of its behavioral characteristics are simulated, forecasted, and predicted, and policy experiments are conducted, with a view to providing references for the prevention and control of agricultural NPS pollution in Nansi Lake Basin and further research.

Abstract Overcoming the trade‐off between the graphitization of the carbon substrate and enhanced electronic metal–support interaction (EMSI) and intrinsic activity of Pt‐C catalysts remains a major challenge for ensuring the durable operation of energy conversion devices. This article presents a hybrid catalyst consisting of PtFe nanoparticles and single Pt and Fe atoms supported on N‐doped carbon (PtFe NPs @PtFe SAs ‐N‐C), which exhibits improved activities in hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (HER and ORR, respectively) and has excellent durability owing to the high graphitization, rich edge defects, and porosity of the carbon in PtFe NPs @PtFe SAs ‐N‐C, as well as strong EMSI between the PtFe nanoparticles and edge‐defective carbon embedded with Pt and Fe atoms. According to theoretical calculations, the strong EMSI optimizes the H* adsorption–desorption and facilitates the adsorption OOH*, accelerating the HER and ORR processes. A novel flow seawater‐Al/acid hybrid fuel cell using the PtFe NPs @PtFe SAs ‐N‐C cathode can serve as a high‐efficiency energy conversion device that delivers a high power density of 109.5 mW cm −2 while producing H 2 at a significantly high rate of 271.6 L m −2 h −1 . Moreover, PtFe NPs @PtFe SAs ‐N‐C exhibits a remarkable performance (high power density of 298.0 mW cm −2 and long‐term durability of 1000 h) in a flow Zn–air battery.

Baoshan is a world-class skarn Cu-polymetallic deposit located at the junction of the Nanling and Qin-Hang metallogenic belts in China. While there has been extensive research on the mineralogy and geochemistry of skarn deposits, studies on the fluid characteristics and evolutionary history from the early to late skarn stages in such deposits are still limited. In this study, we analyzed garnet and pyroxene from the early skarn stage and scheelite from the late skarn stage of the Baoshan deposit. We distinguished two generations of garnet (Grt1 and Grt2), one generation of pyroxene, and three generations of scheelite (Sch I, Sch II, and Sch III) on the basis of mineral assemblages and microscopic characteristics. Grt1 appears coarse-grained, and Grt2 cuts through Grt1 as veinlets. In Grt1, the andradite end-member increases from the core to the rim, while the grossular portion decreases (Ad35–36Gr59–61Sp3–4 to Ad59–61Gr36–37Sp2–3), and in Grt2, the andradite end-member significantly increases (Ad41–73Gr25–55Sp2–3). Grt1 and Grt2 have similar trace element compositions, with enrichment in Zr and depletion in Nb and Hf, depletion in LREE, enrichment in HREE, and weak negative Eu anomalies. Pyroxene coexists with Grt1 and is similarly cut by Grt2, with its composition mainly being diopside (Di82–99Hd0.6–15Jo0–3.2). Sch I and Sch II appear as anhedral to subhedral grains, while Sch III is predominantly found in veinlets. In Sch I and Sch II, most REEs enter the scheelite lattice via the Na-REE coupled substitution mechanism, with a smaller portion substituting Ca vacancies. In Sch III, the substitution mechanism involving Ca site vacancies may dominate. During the early skarn stage, the oxygen fugacity of the fluid gradually decreased from Grt1 and pyroxene to Grt2. In the late skarn stage, fluid oxygen fugacity remains stable from Sch I and Sch II to Sch III in shallow parts but significantly decreases in deeper parts. The garnet and pyroxene from the Baoshan deposit align with typical skarn Cu deposit compositions, while scheelite in the late skarn stage shows Sch I, Sch II, and shallow Sch III as skarn-type and deep Sch III as vein-type scheelite. Early skarn stage fluids were weakly acidic. Sch I, Sch II, and Sch III originated from fluids related to the Baoshan granite porphyry, with Sch III also showing evidence of water–rock interaction. This study reconstructed the fluid evolution history from the early to late skarn stages at the Baoshan deposit, providing insights into the ore-forming processes of other skarn deposits.

Abstract Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor diagnosed in children. Outcomes for high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) have improved but causes of treatment-refractory disease and relapse are poorly understood. ANBL1531 is a Children’s Oncology Group phase 3 study that enrolled over 700 patients with HR-NB. Longitudinal liquid biopsy samples were collected to identify prognostic biomarkers and study patterns of tumor evolution that contribute to treatment resistance. Assessment of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) allows for non-invasive serial sequencing of the tumor genome using peripheral blood samples. We describe sequencing approaches and the progress of this ongoing work. Methods: Serial plasma samples were submitted to the Crompton lab for cell-free DNA sequencing by ultra-low passage whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) to estimate ctDNA content. To date, the Crompton lab has received 2,184 serial plasma samples. Samples with detectable ctDNA were also sequenced by whole-exome sequencing and a pan-cancer panel targeting 400 genes. We have performed deep pan-cancer panel sequencing on 188 longitudinal blood samples collected from 71 patients. Matched germline and primary tumor sequencing data are available for 56 and 49 of these patients, respectively. Paired baseline and relapse plasma samples with ctDNA &gt; 20% were also sequenced by whole genome sequencing to detect relapse-specific changes in nucleosome positioning. Results: ULP-WGS showed that 332/335 patients (99.1%) with a pre-treatment blood sample had detectable ctDNA ranging between 3-99% of total cell-free DNA. ctDNA remained detectable in 84%, 37%, 27%, 3.1%, 2.9% and 0.7% of cases at pre-induction and pre-cycle 2, 3, 4, end-induction, prior to post-consolidation therapy, and end post-consolidation respectively. Paired analysis of sequencing data revealed heterogeneity in the somatic variants detected between primary tumor and ctDNA samples. Five out of 47 patients assigned to a treatment arm for patients with ALK wild-type HR-NB with available tumor and pre-treatment ctDNA sequencing data had somatic mutations in the ALK gene, however, 3 of these mutations were only detectable in ctDNA. We also detected recurrent mutations in RAS/RAF pathway, DNA damage repair pathway, and NOTCH pathway genes. Signature analysis of pre-treatment and relapse samples revealed presence of mismatch repair deficiency and reactive oxygen species signatures. Using nucleosome positioning we detected recurrent changes in the activity of specific transcription factor programs in relapse samples. Functional validation of prioritized relapse-specific ctDNA variants is ongoing and will also be reported. Conclusions: In summary, this research project bridges critical gaps in understanding the primary resistance mechanisms of HR-NB by employing a non-invasive methodology and comprehensive analysis of genomic and translational contributors to tumor evolution. These data provide an opportunity for the discovery of new therapeutic targets that could improve the outcome for patients with HR-NB.

With the rapid progress of science and technology, the research and application in the fields of energy technology and materials science are increasingly in-depth, and experts and scholars around the world are committed to promoting the innovation and development in these areas. It is against this background that we welcomed the highly anticipated 2024 8 th International Conference on Energy Technology and Materials Science (ICETMS 2024). The conference was successfully held in Chongqing, China from May 31 st to June 2 nd , 2024, attracting the participation of almost 100 scholars, researchers and industry experts from all over the world. The convening of this conference has benefited from the active participation and enthusiastic support of experts and scholars around the world. We received a large number of high-quality paper submissions, covering New and Renewable Energy Technologies, Traditional Energy Transformation and Cleaner Production, Energy Storage Technologies and Battery Materials, Energy Security and Sustainable Development, Energy System Simulation and Optimization, and many other aspects. After a rigorous review process, excellent papers from different countries and regions were finally accepted, which fully demonstrated the latest research results and innovative ideas in these domains. In the course of the conference, we invited well-known experts and scholars at home and abroad to give keynote speeches and reports, and their wonderful speeches provided valuable academic inspiration and reflection for the participants. Among these, with the research Industrial Fabrication of Electrocatalysts for Green Hydrogen Production , Prof Hui Pan (University of Macau, China) introduced the design, synthesis and possible industrial production of novel electrocatalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER and OER). And his research demonstrated that multi-metal compound systems were catalytically active for OER and HER in electrochemical energy devices, which may find practical application in hydrogen-energy technologies. At the same time, we also organized a number of group discussions, providing participants with more in-depth communication and interaction opportunities. The successful holding of this conference not only promoted the academic exchanges and cooperation in the fields of energy technology and materials science, but also injected new vitality and impetus into the development of these domains. Finally, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks and high respect to all the experts and scholars who participated in this conference. At the same time, we would also like to thank the organizing committee for its hard work and selfless dedication, which has provided a strong guarantee for the success of the conference. We look forward to continuing to work with experts and scholars in the coming days to promote the development and progress of energy technology and materials science!
