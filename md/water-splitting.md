Electrocatalysis holds paramount significance in driving the progress of sustainable energy technologies, such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and batteries. The presence of various species on the electrode surface, such as reactants, intermediates, and products during electrocatalysis' usually gives rise to complex reaction pathways. A systematic understanding of various electrocatalytic processes in chemical reactions is required to untangle the complicated interaction of species on the catalyst's surface and their influence on the electrocatalytic process. Taking hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as examples, this chapter introduces electrocatalytic mechanisms, feasible reaction pathways, and fundamental concepts to readers and stimulates their interest in the various fields of electrocatalysts and their applications.

Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their high surface area, tunable pore structures, and abundant active sites. Ligand engineering is an important strategy to optimize their performance. Here, we report the synthesis of NiFe‐MOFs based on three different ligands: 1,4‐terephthalic acid (BDC), 2,4‐thiophene dicarboxylic acid (TDC), and 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDC), to investigate the effects of heteroatom‐based aromatic rings on OER performance. It is revealed that by incorporating electronegative sulfur and oxygen atoms into the ligands, the electron density at the metal sites is reduced, leading to enhanced metal‐oxygen covalency and improved charge transfer kinetics. The NiFe‐FDC/NF catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA·cm‐2 and stable performance over 1300 hours at 1 A·cm‐2. In situ infrared spectroscopy reveal minimal structural reconstruction in NiFe‐FDC/NF, contributing to its superior stability. The NiFe‐FDC/NF were then subjected to 3600 hours of OER operation and it’s metal elution was monitored. These findings offer a novel approach to ligand design for high‐performance MOF‐based OER catalysts, highlighting the potential of furan‐based ligands for MOF ligand engineering.

Sustainable energy societies demand rechargeable batteries using ubiquitous-material electrodes of geopolitical-risk-free elements. We aim to develop low-overpotential oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) catalysts that suppress carbon corrosion of gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to realize two-electrode rechargeable Zn-air batteries (r-ZABs). Herein, single-walled-carbon-nanotube (SWNT) thin films are used as a scaffold for a benchmark OER catalyst, doping-free NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFeLDHs), operating in r-ZABs using alkali aqueous electrolytes. Metal compositions of NiFeLDHs are controlled with an atomic-level quality using Prussian-blue-analog nanoparticles of Ni

Iridium oxides are the leading oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, improving iridium utilization is crucial due to its high cost and scarcity. Crystalline rutile-type iridium dioxide (IrO2) offers superior stability in acidic OER conditions compared to amorphous iridium oxide (IrOx), but the high synthesis temperatures required for crystalline phase formation reduce OER activity by decreasing active surface area. Herein, we present a novel perchlorate fusion–hydrothermal (PFHT) synthesis method to produce nano-crystalline rutile-type IrO2 nanoparticles with exceptional OER performance. This low-temperature approach involves calcination 300 °C in the presence of a strong oxidizing agent, sodium perchlorate, followed by hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C, yielding ~2 nm IrO2 nanoparticles. The catalyst achieved a high mass-specific OER activity of 95 A gIr–1 at 1.525 VRHE in ex situ glass-cell testing. Notably, the PFHT-synthesized IrO2 demonstrated remarkable stability under harsh accelerated stress test conditions, outperforming commercial catalysts. The exceptional activity of the catalyst was confirmed with in situ PEMWE single-cell evaluations. This demonstrates that the PFHT synthesis method leverages the superior intrinsic properties of nano-crystalline IrO2, effectively overcoming the typical trade-offs between OER activity and catalyst stability, making it a promising approach for advancing PEMWE technologies.

Developing highly efficient, cost‐effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large‐scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal‐air batteries. Herein, a new ternary‐atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2‐N6 and Ni‐N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen‐doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as‐synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in an alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2‐N6 or Ni‐N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2‐N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d‐band centers by the Ni‐N4 sites. This ternary‐atom catalyst may be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt‐ and Ru‐based catalysts to drive both ORR and OER in rechargeable zinc‐air batteries and other related applications.

Hematite photoanodes, a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, are far from reaching their theoretical photocurrent limit. Further designing high-performance hematite-based photoanodes requires an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of PEC water splitting. In situ and operando spectral characterizations facilitate the mechanism investigation, revealing the dynamic surface structures and intermediates of hematite photoanodes during the PEC water splitting process. Herein, in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques were applied for a mechanistic understanding of hematite-based photoanodes in the PEC water splitting system, such as UV–visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The recent progress on charge carrier dynamics and interfacial reaction intermediates of hematite photoanodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is summarized. An outlook on challenges and prospects of in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques for PEC water splitting is given. This review will inspire future mechanism investigation of photoanodes for PEC water splitting to achieve higher performance.

Abstract Spinel‐type nickel ferrite (Ni x Fe 3‐x O 4 , x≤1) is a widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the lower hybridization of metal‐ d and oxygen‐ p orbitals, the OER process on Ni x Fe 3‐x O 4 follows the sluggish adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Generally, activating the lattice oxygen to trigger the lattice‐oxygen‐mediated mechanism (LOM) can enhance the OER activity. Herein, to trigger the LOM pathway while maintaining high stability, iron foam (IF)‐supported Ni 0.75 Fe 2.25 O 4 (NiFeO) with geometrical defects of [NiO 6 ] (nickel cation coordinated with six oxygen anions) units and higher ratio of Fe to Ni cations in octahedral sites ( d ‐NiFe HR O/IF) is prepared by ion‐exchanging with polar aprotic solvent followed by annealing. As a result, as‐synthesized d ‐NiFe HR O/IF exhibits excellent activity (at 295 mV overpotential to achieve 100 mA cm −2 ), fast kinetics (Tafel slope of only 34.6 mV dec −1 ), and high stability (maintaining a current density of 100 mA cm −2 over 130 h) for the OER. The theoretical calculations reveal that the construction of octahedral defect in Ni x Fe 3‐x O 4 enhances the overlap of Fe‐ d and O‐ p orbitals, which can activate the lattice oxygen. Therefore, increasing the ratio of Fe to Ni will further improve the lattice oxygen redox activity, and thus trigger the fast LOM pathway, ultimately facilitating the OER process.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has a significant influence on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the electrocatalytic splitting of water/seawater, because of its sluggish reaction kinetics and complex mechanism. Additionally, in the case of seawater, the presence of chloride anions is harmful for the metallic electrocatalysts and their electrode surfaces, leading to oxidation and the generation of environmentally harmful chlorine gas or hypochlorite ion during the oxidation process, decreasing the efficiency for OER and hampering the overall electrolysis process. To tackle this problem, highly potent and advanced OER electrocatalysts needs to be designed for electrolyzing seawater. This paper presents a detailed discussion on the recent progress made in the research and development of OER electrocatalysts for the process of splitting seawater. It comprehensively explores the use of many types of catalysts, such as polymetallic and heterostructure phosphides, layered double hydroxide-based materials, transition-metal oxides, spinel and perovskite metal oxides, and nitride catalysts, in the process of seawater electrolysis. A summary of the overall seawater splitting performances of few recently reported catalysts falling in the above categories has been provided. An overview of the current state of affairs that includes the expenses, synthesis difficulties, activities, and electrocatalyst stability has been provided in order to aid in a more accurate assessment. The DFT calculations and in situ characterization methods that help in catalyst development are highlighted extensively in this article. Furthermore, a number of requirements that could come up during the electrochemical conversions have been covered, including high conductivity, corrosion resistance, and the ability to avoid aside oxidation and reduction processes. Additionally, the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties of the electrode have been incorporated. This particular property enhances the electrode's interaction with the electrolyte, increases mass transfer efficiency, and speeds up the removal of O2 bubbles during the electrocatalytic OER. Compared to freshwater electrolysis, a variety of challenges have been hampering the practical application of seawater electrolysis (SWE). This paper provides a thorough summary of all relevant data required to generate an effective and active catalyst for SWE.

Resolving the three-dimensional structure of transition metal oxide nanoparticles (TMO-NPs), upon self-restructuring from solution, is crucial for tuning their structure–functionality. Yet, this remains challenging as this process entails complex structure fluctuations, which are difficult to track experimentally and, hence, hinder the knowledge-driven optimization of TMO-NPs. Herein, we combine high-energy synchrotron X-ray absorption and X-ray total scattering experiments with atomistic multiscale simulations to investigate the self-restructuring of self-assembled Co-NPs from solution under dark or photocatalytic water oxidation conditions at distinct reaction times and atomic length-scales. Using the atomic range order as a descriptor, we reveal that dissolution of a Co-salt in BO3 buffer leads to a self-optimization route forming disordered oxyborate Co3BOx-NPs unveiling a high oxygen yield due to the formation of surface oxo/hydroxo adsorbates. Those Co3BOx-NPs further self-restructure into distorted Co3O4-NPs and, lastly, into distorted CoOOH-NPs through a rate-limiting step integrating Co3+-states during the course of a representative photocatalytic assay. Self-restructuring does not proceed from amorphous-to-ordered states but through stochastic fluctuations of atomic nanoclusters of ≈10 Å domain size. Our key insight into the structure-selection dynamics of TMO-NPs from solution offers a route for tuning their structure–function relationships for wide-ranging emergent technologies.

Abstract Defect engineering is widely regarded as a promising strategy to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts for water splitting. In this work, defective NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) with a high density of edge sites (edge‐rich NiFe LDH) is synthesized via a simple reduction process during the early stages of nucleation. The introduction of edges into oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts modulates the electronic structure of the active sites. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses revealed that the edges facilitated the formation of unsaturated Ni‐Ni coordination, which is crucial for promoting the deprotonation of the OH * intermediate. Consequently, the edge‐rich NiFe LDH exhibited a significantly lower overpotential of 228 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm⁻ 2 , compared to 275 mV for pristine NiFe LDH. The assembled membrane electrode can reach a current density of 1000 mA cm⁻ 2 at a cell voltage of 2.5 V. This study highlights the role of edge effects in defect engineering to enhance OER activity and provides valuable theoretical insights for the design of efficient electrocatalysts.

Abstract Effective first‐row transition metal‐based electrocatalysts are crucial for large‐scale hydrogen energy generation and anion exchange membrane (AEM) devices in water splitting. The present work describes that SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH nanosheets on nickel foam are used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and AEM water electrolyzer study. Tuning the Ni‐to‐Fe ratios in NiFe‐LDH and doping with Sm ions improves the electrical structure and intrinsic activity. SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH has higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, and TWS activity, achieving 10 mA cm⁻ 2 current density at lower overpotentials (230 mV, 95 mV, and 1.62 V, respectively). In AEMWE cells, SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH as a cathode and anode pair exhibits outstanding activity (0.9 A cm⁻ 2 at 2 V) and stability over 120 h. Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations reveal that the Sm doping in NiFe‐LDH surface enhances its bifunctional activity toward OER and HER. These findings emphasize the potential of non‐noble composites for long‐term water electrolysis in total water splitting and AEMWE applications.

Abstract Perovskite oxides have been considered promising oxygen catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), owing to structural and compositional flexibility, and tailorable properties. Ingenious B‐site ordered La 1.5 Sr 0.5 NiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 O 6 (LSNMF) double perovskite is strategically designed by simultaneously interposing Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 and Ni 0.5 Fe 0.5 into B′ and B″ sites. Controlling B‐site cation systematically tailors the electronic structure of the B‐site cation with a d‐band center (M d ) upshift close to the Fermi level, increasing the overlap of the M d center and O 2p center (O P ). The strong interaction of M d and O p facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and activates the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process, thereby enhancing the ORR and OER activity. For ORR, LSNMF exhibited an onset potential of 0.9 V along with a high limiting current of −8.05 mA cm −2 . At the same time, for OER at 1 m KOH, LSNMF effectively reached a maximum current density of 3000 mA cm −2 . Most importantly, the difference between E ORR (at −1 mA cm −2 ) and E OER (at 10 mA cm −2 ), ΔE is 0.69 V, which stands among the best of recently reported perovskites. The as‐designed LSNMF is stable, efficient, lucrative, and a promising candidate for practical application.

The catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon monoxide (CO) via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction offers a promising pathway toward a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the competing Sabatier reaction presents a significant challenge, underscoring the need for highly efficient catalysts. In this study, we developed a novel catalyst comprising cobalt-oxide-supported nickel-hydroxide nanoparticles (denoted as Co@Ni). This catalyst achieved a remarkable CO production yield of ~5,144 &mu;mol gcatalyst⁻&sup1; at 573 K, with a CO selectivity of 77%. These values represent 30% and 70% improvements over carbon-supported Ni(OH)2 (Ni-AC) and CoO (Co-AC) nanoparticles, respectively. Comprehensive physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses reveal that the exceptional CO yield of the Co@Ni catalyst stems from the synergistic electronic interactions between adjacent active sites. Specifically, cobalt-oxide domains act as electron donors to Ni sites, facilitating efficient H2 splitting. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies in cobalt oxide enhance CO2 adsorption and promote subsequent dissociation. These findings provide critical insights into the design of highly efficient and selective catalysts for the RWGS reaction, paving the way for advancements in sustainable carbon utilization technologies.

Iron plays a central and critical role in the water oxidation mechanism and the activity of transition-metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides. Tracking Fe dynamics (deposition/dissolution/electrolyte transport) and unraveling the chemistries of various Fe active sites under oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) conditions are important for catalyst design, particularly for applications in alkaline electrolysis. Here, we use CoOxHy thin films as a platform to investigate Fe transport and reactivity at the catalyst-electrolyte interface and its impact on OER activity. We find that the deposition/dissolution of the surface-absorbed Fe species is governed by the transport of soluble Fe species and applied potential. Soluble Fe species in the electrolyte adsorb on CoOxHy under stirred electrolyte conditions. Accelerated Fe desorption is observed with a more-positive OER potential. The surface-localized Fe sites generated by absorption from soluble Fe species have a higher OER turnover frequency (TOFFe) compared to Fe in codeposited CoFeOxHy films. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows structural similarity between reference Fe oxyhydroxides and surface Fe sites on CoOxHy, contrasting with Fe sites within the CoOxHy structure made by codeposition, where Fe shows a different apparent X-ray absorption edge energy. The OER activity of the surface-absorbed Fe decreased by Fe desorption but was recoverable by redepositing Fe species under non-OER conditions.

Lowering the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and promoting the catalytic activity of cobalt-based perovskite air electrodes is crucial for efficient solid oxide cells (SOCs) devices. However, the co-achievement of both merits has usually been largely compromised in most scenarios.

Perovskites are broadly considered a promising class of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. In particular, lanthanum-based perovskites, like La0.75Sr0.25MnO3-δ (LSMO), LaFeO3-δ (LFO), La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.98O3-δ (LSFO), La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ (LSCFO) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.99O3-δ (LSCO), have been researched as catalysts for the OER showing high catalytic activity. Stability assessment, on the other hand, is rarely carried out at industrial operating conditions, despite it being a precondition for industrial uptake. In this study, the material stability and intrinsic activity were evaluated at industrial alkaline water electrolysis conditions. LSMO showed high activity but instability due to Mn leaching. LSCFO and LFO demonstrated high activity at 75°C, but computational Pourbaix diagrams of both LFO and LSCFO predict instability at the operational potential window, which was confirmed during long-term stability testing. The overall findings highlight the importance of long-term testing at industrial operating conditions, as stability investigations at mild laboratory conditions are insufficient to qualify a candidate catalyst for industrial uptake.

The increase in the production of renewable electricity offers the opportunity to transition from the usage of fossil-based hydrogen to green hydrogen. While mass production of green hydrogen by water electrolysis demands substantial freshwater resources, the abundant availability of seawater provides a promising opportunity to directly use it as an electrolyte in a water electrolyzer. However, a major challenge in seawater electrolysis is the low selectivity for oxygen evolution compared to the chlorine evolution at the anode. To address this, we proposed a strategy to boost the selectivity for oxygen evolution by hydrated electrocatalysis, in which water is itself part of the catalyst. Water molecules that are coordinately bonded to the active catalytic sites play a significant role in enhancing oxygen evolution selectivity. This approach was demonstrated with Prussian blue analogue electrocatalysts in acidified simulated seawater electrolyte using rotating ring disk electrode voltammetry. Microkinetic modeling was employed to correlate the coverage by the reactants (H2O and Cl–) with selectivity. Notably, the crystal water coverage on hydrated electrocatalysts emerged as the partial descriptor for the selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction. To gain insights for coverage by crystal water and Cl–, the thermogravimetric analysis combined with Rietveld refinement and microkinetic Tafel analysis was performed. In a nutshell, we explored the question: if the reactant molecule (H2O) is an integral part of the catalyst, can it promote the corresponding electrochemical oxidation reaction (O2 evolution) over its competitor (Cl2 evolution)?

Abstract The rapid advancement of the green hydrogen industry has driven a surge in demand for devices that operate over a broad range of current density. Despite this, the development of stable iridium‐based catalysts for high‐current‐density applications in oxygen evolution reactions remains a significant challenge. In this study, directed electron modulation (DEM) of iridium oxide clusters on cobalt hydroxide nanosheets is achieved using a cyclic Joule heating strategy in pure water. The strategy achieves a rapid change of environmental energy during electronic modulation through Joule heating, which ensures strong electronic coupling between IrO 2 and Co(OH) 2 without significant changes in initial catalyst nanostructure and cluster size. Directed electron modulation optimizes the reactant adsorption ability of the active center (IrO 2 cluster) and corresponding reaction kinetics are improved, resulting in the catalyst (DEM‐IrO 2 @Co(OH) 2 ‐NF) showing excellent performance. The DEM‐IrO 2 @Co(OH) 2 ‐NF exhibits excellent catalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes with only 296 mV overpotential up to 1 A cm −2 and no significant degradation in 1000 h stability test at 1 A cm −2 . Additionally, the anion exchange membrane electrolyzer using DEM‐IrO 2 @Co(OH) 2 ‐NF||Pt/C requires only 1.68 V at 1 A cm −2 and remains stable for 200 h. This work will provide new directions for optimization of active centers.

Abstract Developing efficient and low‐cost electrocatalysts with exceptional durability and electrocatalytic activity for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a significant challenge, primarily owing to the irreversible dissolution of the electrocatalysts in acidic electrolytes. Here, a rutile‐structured (RuSnSbReF)O x high entropy solid solution is successfully fabricated on the substrate of corrosion‐resistant titanium via a high‐temperature sintering technique. The (RuSnSbReF)O x electrocatalyst for the OER achieves a super‐low overpotential of 156 mV and a small Tafel slope of 23.87 mV dec −1 at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in a 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution. A high‐stable operation potential is performed for the long‐term measurement of 213 h at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 . There is a lower energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (RDS) on the Ruthenium (Ru)‐Rhenium (Re) bridge site of the (RuSnSbReF)O x electrocatalyst in comparison with that of other sites for acidic OER. The reservoir‐like Re species in the (RuSnSbReF)O x can bestow/save the electrons to the Ru site through O‐bridges, favorably adjusting the electronic structure and the oxidation state. This investigation opens a feasible avenue to develop an efficient and durable Ru‐based electrocatalysts of rutile‐structured high entropy solid solution for the OER toward the practical applications of electrochemical industry in acidic media.

NiFe-based materials, especially NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), are recognized as the most promising non-precious metal electrocatalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the precisely designed distribution of active sites for enhancing activities is still significantly restricted due to the lack of reasonable modulation strategies.

The transition to sustainable green hydrogen production demands innovative electrocatalyst design strategies that can overcome current technological limitations. This study introduces a comprehensive data-driven approach to predicting and understanding catalytic performance for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) using advanced machine learning methodologies. By usimg a dataset of 16,226 data points from the Catalysis-hub database, we developed a novel stacking ensemble model that integrates Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression to predict Gibbs free energy of adsorption across diverse bimetallic alloy surfaces. Our innovative feature engineering strategy combined Matminer-based compositional analysis, Principal Component Analysis for adsorption site related features, and correlation screening to generate robust predictive descriptors. The machine learning model demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities, achieving R^2 values of 0.98 for HER and 0.94 for OER, with Mean Absolute Error values of 0.251 and 0.121, respectively. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis revealed critical insights into the complex interplay of compositional, structural, and electronic features governing catalytic performance. The research provides a powerful computational framework for accelerating electrocatalyst design, offering unprecedented insights into the fundamental properties that drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. By bridging advanced machine learning techniques with fundamental electrochemical principles, this study presents a transformative approach to developing cost-effective, high-performance catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

When the ejecta of supernovae interact with the progenitor star's circumstellar environment, a strong shock is driven back into the ejecta, causing the material to become bright optically and in X-rays. Most notably, as the shock traverses the H-rich envelope, it begins to interact with metal rich material. Thus, continued monitoring of bright and nearby supernovae provides valuable clues about both the progenitor structure and its pre-supernova evolution. Here we present late-time, multi-epoch optical and Chandra} X-ray spectra of the core-collapse supernova SN 1996cr. Magellan IMACS optical spectra taken in July 2017 and August 2021 show a very different spectrum from that seen in 2006 with broad, double-peaked optical emission lines of oxygen, argon, and sulfur with expansion velocities of $\pm 4500$ km s$^{-1}$. Red-shifted emission components are considerably fainter compared to the blue-shifted components, presumably due to internal extinction from dust in the supernova ejecta. Broad $\pm 2400$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\alpha$ is also seen which we infer is shocked progenitor pre-SN mass-loss, H-rich material. Chandra data indicate a slow but steady decline in overall X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the forward shock has broken through any circumstellar shell or torus which is inferred from prior deep Chandra ACIS-S/HETG observations. The X-ray properties are consistent with what is expected from a shock breaking out into a lower density environment. Though originally identified as a SN IIn, based upon late time optical emission line spectra, we argue that the SN 1996cr progenitor was partially or highly stripped, suggesting a SN IIb/Ib.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE) have garnered significant attention over the past decade among researchers worldwide due to their economical electrolyzer components, including bipolar plates, flow fields, electrocatalysts, and membrane materials. They represent a cost-effective alternative to high-performing yet expensive proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). The allure of AEMWE lies in their affordable cell hardware and components, albeit at the expense of somewhat reduced durability and overall performance compared to PEMWE systems. While AEMWE anodes may not match the activity levels of noble metal catalysts, their abundance and cost-effectiveness render them compelling options. Interest in this domain revolves around utilizing earth-abundant metal oxides, binary and ternary metal oxides featuring transition metals like iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), and other readily available materials boasting various oxidation states and coordination configurations. Among these, manganese-based oxides such as MnO 2 and its derivatives have been extensively explored for their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Intriguingly, the complexation of manganese with calcium (Ca) to yield CaMnOx electrodes mirrors the active site complexes found in natural metalloenzymes involved in facilitating OER processes, such as those seen in photosynthetic enzymes like photosystem II. These bioinspired electrocatalysts, mimicking nature's design, hold immense promise for integration into AEMWE setups as cost-effective, durable, and efficient OER catalysts [1], [2], [3], [4]. In this study, we investigate Ca x Mn y Ox z electrocatalysts with varying atomic ratios through comprehensive performance and durability evaluations via Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE), Gas Diffusion Electrode (GDE) half-cell, and Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) testing. In-house MEA stability testing out to 25 hours at 1 A/cm 2 demonstrated steady state voltages of 1.87 V and 1.90 V for CaMn 3 Ox and CaMn 4 Ox, respectively. Additionally, polarization curves at 0 h and 20 h reveal an improvement in performance from 1.9 V at 1 A/cm 2 down to 1.8 A/cm 2 for both Ca x Mn y Ox z catalysts, suggesting an activation of the Ca x Mn y Ox z with use. Our findings reveal that these CaMnOx-based anodes perform comparably to benchmarked commercially available NiFeOx counterparts for AEMWE applications, underscoring their potential as viable alternatives in the pursuit of sustainable hydrogen production.

Tackling climate change demands the deployment of sustainable technologies, among which alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) emerges as one of the pivotal solutions. In AWE, anode morphology plays a critical role in facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a key step in splitting water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas. OER performance can be enhanced by fine-tuning the morphology of the anodes [1, 2]. Therefore, there is a critical need to quantitatively comprehend surface morphology or coating quality quantitatively and define the relationships between these surface features and the activity of anodes. We have observed that conducting a quantitative analysis of the nanoscale structure of anodes produced via ultrasonic spray coating provides a reliable metric, serving as a descriptor to evaluate the quality of particle-based catalyst coatings [3, 4]. For this quantitative analysis, it is crucial to characterize the structure with high resolution. However, high-resolution techniques commonly employed such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) have a significant limitation. They cover only a small measurement area that may not represent the entire surface area. In response to this need, we have introduced multistage data quantification (MSDQ) technique as a full-scale surface extrapolation method. The MSDQ technique is a statistical approach that facilitates an impartial characterization of surfaces by optimizing the process of region selection (ROS) and feature extraction, as exemplified in Figure 1. We validated MSDQ through the characterization of anodes produced utilizing different spray coating processing parameters. AFM was employed to capture surface morphology. Through MSDQ, the following surface characteristics are extracted: the surface roughness indicates the variations of surface texture, measuring the peaks and valleys on the surface, the roughness factor refers to the total area covered by the electrode surface to the projected area, and the homogeneity score quantifies the uniformity of the surface structure, essential for assessing the consistency of catalyst coatings were extracted. For validation, in a first proof of principle, extrinsic surface features were correlated to electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. The anode that showed a consistent surface topography yielded uniform electrochemical activity, while the anode that displayed irregular surface characteristics also lead to a more wide-spread electrochemical activity. To validate the reliability of the MSDQ technique, we conducted independent ROS measurements and found that the measured features were consistent with the ranges previously predicted by MSDQ. This consistency underscores the effectiveness of MSDQ in accurately characterizing surface features of anode, further establishing its credibility as a robust tool for surface analysis. Taken together, the developed strategy exhibits high potential for adaptability across diverse electrochemical systems and their components. Moreover, it acts as a powerful approach for linking statistically backed-up surface characteristics, also beyond AFM, with electrochemical activity. This capability enhances our understanding of how surface nuances influence the overall electrochemical performance, offering valuable insights into optimizing material compositions and processing techniques for improved functionality.

Exploring efficient nonpyrolysis conductive metal organic frameworks with high intrinsic reactivity is critical for their application in the electrocatalytic field. Herein, we present electronically conductive π-d-conjugated Co and Fe bimetallic MOF-CoFe-hexahydroxytriphenylene (CoFe-HHTP) nanorods with atomically dispersed Co–O6 and Fe–O6 sites for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The introduction of Fe not only increases the electronic conductivity of Co-HHTP with an order of magnitude favoring the electronic transfer during OER catalysis but also tailors the electronic structure of Co, leading to a downshift of Co d-band center that weakens the adsorption of oxygen intermediates on Co sites. As a result, the as-prepared CoFe-HHTP exhibits a significantly improved OER activity showing a lower overpotential (316 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 in an alkaline electrolyte compared with pure Co-HHTP (370 mV), outperforming commercial RuO2 (329 mV). CoFe-HHTP also displays a superior electrochemical durability with only a slight change of potential after a 200 h test at 10 mA cm–2, outperforming pure Co-HHTP (140 h). The improved durability was due to the hindered dissolution of Co by suppressing structural transformation in the presence of Fe in the alkaline electrolyte. When CoFe-HHTP was used as the anode catalyst, a superior alkaline electrolyzer performance was obtained with a cell voltage of 1.821 V at 500 mA cm–2 and a stable operation of 50 h. This methodology offers insights into the design and synthesis of conductive MOF-based catalysts for efficient OER catalysis.

Iridium-based catalysts are important for increasing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency of water splitting, but their high cost and scarcity require the development of new electrodematerial structure. Alloyed nanoparticles have modified electrochemical structure for improved OER activity andstable support such as perovskite oxide can be applied due to its high oxygen transfer rate. This research focuses on developing iridium-transition metal alloy nanoparticles on a stable perovskite support to improve OER performance and durability. The changes in particle size, composition, and temperature-controlled structure are the main research topics, highlighting balancing activity and economics to produce hydrogen in an environmentally friendly way.

Abstract Achieving large‐scale coupling of organic electrooxidation and the hydrogen evolution reaction, while understanding the competition between organic electrooxidation and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a significant challenge. In this study, using Ni 3 N‐MoN/NF, an efficient heterojunction electrocatalyst as both anode and cathode in a 50 cm 2 continuous flow reactor, we achieved a total current of ~20 A at 2.6 V. This resulted in the highest single‐pass 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural conversion efficiency (0.049 mmol cm −2 min −1 ) and gram‐level production of 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid. Theoretical studies revealed that MoN accelerated *OH formation and increased its deprotonation energy barrier, leading to *OH accumulation, effectively promoting organic electrooxidation and inhibiting OER. We anticipate that our foundation in understanding the reaction mechanism and catalyst design strategy can be extended to a wider range of anodic oxidation reactions.

Producing hydrogen through water splitting often faces challenges of overpotential, stability, and expensive catalysts, which limit its efficiency and hinder the advancement of hydrogen production technologies. Nickel foam and nickel meshes have emerged as promising materials for electrolyzer electrodes due to their high surface area and the ability to produce electrolyzers with a very small gap between the anode and cathode. This study presents a simple method for coating Ni-based electrodes with a chiral Ni–Au film, using electroplating, thus enhancing its efficiency dramatically. We introduce chirality to the electroplating layer by incorporating an enantiopure chiral reagent into the electroplating solution. The chiral layer enhances the oxygen evolution reaction due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect. By optimizing the chiral electroplating process, we demonstrate the reduction of the overpotential and an increase in the reaction efficiency by 95% at 1 M KOH at room temperature.

Photosystem II (PSII) splits water in oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth. The structure and function of the C 4 S 4 M 2 -type PSII-LHCII (light-harvesting complex II) megacomplexes from the wild-type and PsbR-deletion mutant plants are studied through electron microscopy (EM), structural mass spectrometry, and ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy [time-resolved fluorescence (TRF)]. The cryo-EM structure of a type I C 4 S 4 M 2 megacomplex demonstrates that the three domains of PsbR bind to the stromal side of D1, D2, and CP43; associate with the single transmembrane helix of the redox active Cyt b 559 ; and stabilize the luminal extrinsic PsbP, respectively. This megacomplex, with PsbR and PsbY centered around the narrow interface between two dimeric PSII cores, provides the supramolecular structural basis that regulates the plastoquinone occupancy in Q B site, excitation energy transfer, and oxygen evolution. PSII-LHCII megacomplexes (types I and II) and LHC aggregation levels in Arabidopsis psbR mutant were also interrogated and compared to wild-type plants through EM and picosecond TRF.

Side reactions of water decomposition and capacitive reactions occur concomitantly in aqueous supercapacitors. To improve the energy density, integrated design modifications to address the impact of these two aspects on the reaction kinetics are theoretically effective. Herein, a two-step modification strategy for introducing binary functional species is designed to regulate the chemical environment and electronic structure of the metal active sites and further optimize the electrochemical kinetics comprehensively. For promoting the capacitive reactions, Ag nanoparticles were loaded to decrease the corresponding energy barriers. For suppressing the oxygen evolution side reaction, preintercalation of K+ ions was realized to increase the corresponding energy barriers. The assembled supercapacitor device shows an ultrahigh energy density of 143.2 Wh kg–1. Uniquely, in situ techniques, DFT calculations, and overpotential tests are combined to verify the suppression mechanism. This work provides valuable guidance for coordinating designs and studies on the electrochemical kinetics of transition-metal-based electrode materials.

Abstract Spinel oxides still exhibit unsatisfactory electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) given their low intrinsic activity, poor electronic conductivity, and limited exposure of reaction sites. Defect engineering has garnered intensive attention and become a promising strategy to enhance the reaction kinetics. In this work, spinel NiFe 2 O 4 nanospheres with rich nickel vacancies are prepared via simple one‐pot hydrothermal synthesis. Combined electrochemical measurements and in situ Raman characterization prove that a relatively higher degree of electrochemical surface reconstruction is realized after the introduction of nickel vacancies in NiFe 2 O 4 , in addition to boosted OER electrocatalytic performance. Further theoretical calculations also reveal that the cation‐vacancy‐induced effect can reduce the difficulty for surface reconstruction by increasing the octahedral nickel‐oxygen covalency in nickel ferrite. Contributed to the great structural flexibility and optimized electronic structure of the pre‐catalyst, the reconstructed electrocatalyst presents desirable OER performance, accompanied by long durability in alkaline solution. This work provides a sound strategy to intensify surface reconstruction on spinel oxides and design electrocatalysts with high efficiency toward water oxidation.

Abstract Photoelectrocatalysis has the capability to utilize solar energy to produce hydrogen and valuable chemicals; however, their conversion efficiency remains to reach practical thresholds. Here, a rapid‐ramping annealing strategy is reported to synthesize nanoporous Mo‐doped bismuth vanadate (MBVO) photoanodes with (001)‐preferred orientation. This approach leverages the enhanced carrier transport along the crystallographic [001] direction, optimizing the bulk photoelectrical properties of the MBVO photoanodes. By substituting the surface oxygen evolution reaction with the glycerol oxidation reaction, the photoconversion efficiency is significantly boosted, reaching a photocurrent density of 7.45 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus RHE and an incident photon‐to‐current conversion efficiency of ≈100% for hydrogen generation, accompanied by the production of value‐added products in a high rate (≈1700 mmol m −2 h −1 in total) with a total Faradaic efficiency up to 96%. These results shed light on the construction of practical photoelectrocatalysis systems by demonstrating the potential of bulk‐phase engineering coupled with surface reaction design.

Proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysers (PEMWEs) can directly produce hydrogen gas under pressurised conditions, which provides an attractive means to reduce post-electrolysis compression costs. Experimental studies have shown a lower-than-expected increase in PEMWE operation voltage under elevated pressure, but existing modelling approaches have difficulties to adequately explain these observations. Herein, a combined theoretical–experimental approach is presented to elucidate the effect of pressure on water electrolysis kinetics in a PEMWE. Experiments, performed under differential and balanced pressure changes, clearly demonstrate a sub-Nernstian response of the PEMWE polarisation curve to pressure increase at both the hydrogen and oxygen electrodes. The kinetic origin of the effect was revealed by a novel modelling strategy accounting for the distinct contributions of the oxygen evolution (OER), hydrogen evolution (HER), and hydrogen oxidation (HOR) reactions to the activation losses, which are defined on a fixed reference potential scale. By simultaneously fitting the experimental data at multiple operating pressures, the sub-Nernstian voltage response is accurately reproduced and shown to arise from the superimposed kinetics of the OER, HER, and HOR. Effectively, increasing the operating pressure thereby transforms part of the irreversible activation losses into useful compression energy, thus enhancing the energy efficiency of the process. The model further demonstrates that deviations from Tafel-line behaviour observed at intermediate current densities are due to a decreased influence of the HOR reverse reaction at the hydrogen electrode. This work is expected to give direction to future developments in high-pressure PEMWE modelling and performance analysis.

Water electrolysis, utilizing renewable energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, stands out as a promising avenue for generating and storing clean energy from sustainable sources. This study focuses on creating pore-filling anion exchange membranes (PFAEMs) employing an electrolyte monomer incorporating a quaternary ammonium group. Various cross-linker groups of different chain lengths were introduced, while porous polyethylene substrates were treated with surfactants to transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Evaluation of the anion exchange membrane conductivity was conducted in both in-plane and through-plane configurations at room temperature and 60 ℃. Additionally, comprehensive characterizations of the anion exchange membranes encompassing water uptake, swelling ratio, mechanical strength, contact angle, FTIR, SAXs, WAXs, DSC, and TGA analyses were carried out. Consequently, the PFAEM demonstrated notably high ion conductivity with minimal areal swelling ratio and exceptional chemical stability in a KOH solution for 500 hours. As a crucial component of AEMWE, the catalyst layer was prepared using catalyst inks, namely XB-7 ionomer-based and Nafion ionomer-based inks for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst layers, to assess impedance and I-V polarization curves.

Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts are pivotal for enhancing the performance of rechargeable zinc-air batteries, particularly in facilitating the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recent strides in electrostatic spinning technology have yielded notable progress in polymer-zinc-air battery systems. This study introduces two innovative methodologies for synthesizing self-supporting flexible bifunctional electrocatalysts featuring hierarchical structures and high catalytic activity through meticulous adjustment of electrostatic spinning parameters. The first approach integrates metal-organic frameworks with electrospinning technology to fabricate FeCoNi nanoparticle-decorated N-doped carbon hierarchical networks. These nanoparticles, originating from Fe 3+ /Co 2+ /Ni 2+ ions within the electrospun fibers, catalyze the pyrolysis of ZIF-67 on the fiber surface, thereby generating reticulated carbon microfibers. The second approach capitalizes on the characteristics of organic salts in polymer solutions via electrospinning to produce FeCoNi flexible carbon nanofibers. These catalysts undergo secondary growth of FeCoNi- and N-doped carbon nanotubes on fiber surfaces, yielding numerous metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) ORR active sites and FeCoNi alloy-based OER active sites. Both methodologies yield bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibiting outstanding ORR and OER activity, surpassing conventional Pt/C and RuO 2 catalysts. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries employing these catalysts demonstrate high peak power density and remarkable cycling stability, positioning them as promising contenders for next-generation energy storage solutions.

Abstract The electrocatalytic oxidation of solketal (SOR) as the anodic reaction can be used to enhance hydrogen production efficiency due to its lower overpotential compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Additionally, solketal oxidation yields besides formate also high‐value C 3 products, providing an advantage over the typical alternative reaction for OER, glycerol oxidation. The multi‐metal CoNiFeCu (1:1:1:0.5) catalyst is employed as electrocatalyst for SOR and different activation procedures are explored. The pre‐conditioning of the catalyst in the presence of solketal supports a current density of 10 mA cm −2 to be recorded at only 1.405 ± 1 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) during SOR, while promoting glyceric acid synthesis with 40% faradaic efficiency. Operando attenuated total reflection Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR‐FTIR) confirms that the activation of the catalyst contributes to an increased formation of products. However, most importantly, through utilizing the single‐particle‐on‐the‐nanoelectrode with identical‐location transmission electron microscope (IL‐TEM), it is unveiled that solketal suppresses Cu leaching and oxyhydroxide formation. Moreover, the structural transformations are correlated with the increased activity toward SOR.

Abstract To address the urgent need for sustainable energy processes, there is a growing demand for multifunctional materials that mimic natural photosynthetic enzyme functions, specifically light‐harvesting, efficient photoinduced charge separation, and integration of molecularly defined catalysts, synergistically interacting within these structures. Herein, the successful synthesis of an innovative Covalent Organic Framework ( COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ ) constructed from optically active triazine (TFPT) and isoquinoline units (IsoQ) as building blocks is reported. Post‐synthetic incorporation of a Ru(bda)‐based water oxidation catalyst (WOC) is achieved through the IsoQ moieties acting as coordinating sites. Leveraging the synthetic flexibility of the designed COF architecture featuring binding sites on its pore walls, various Ru@COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ systems at different Ru:COF ratios are synthesized and tested in the photoinduced (λ > 400 nm) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under sacrificial conditions. All synthesized Ru@COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ systems demonstrate efficiency in the photocatalytic OER, with the highest turnover number (TON) of 9.1 observed for the system where the Ru‐based WOC is incorporated every fourth COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ unit cell. This work provides valuable insights into the structural integration and catalytic behavior of Ru‐based complexes within COF architectures, highlighting the potential of Ru@COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ as a robust, efficient, and synthetically flexible multifunctional material for light‐induced water oxidation catalysis.

Abstract Iridium (Ir)‐based electrocatalysts have long been employed as the benchmark for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, but further to improve their catalytic activity still facing great challenges. Herein, alkali metal K is incorporated to induce the in situ construction of a core‐shell hybrid of K‐IrO x thin skin‐wrapped metallic Ir (K‐IrO x /Ir) to boost the acidic OER. The K‐IrO x /Ir exhibits exceptional catalytic performance with a long lasting stability of 3000 h operation and a low overpotential of 199 mV to reach the 10 mA cm −2 . Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies revealed that the enrichment of K in the low‐coordination IrO x shell induces a significant compressive strain, which regulates the Ir─O bond properties and further optimizes the adsorption energy of rate‐limiting intermediates, favoring of the enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, the surface IrO x active layer is well maintained during the OER process thanks to the mixed‐valence state and intensified electronic interaction in core‐shell hybrid that inhibit the overoxidation and dissolution of Ir, responsible for the outstanding stability. This work offers a novel strategy for developing high performance acidic OER catalysts by the design of favorable mesostructured architectures with mixed metal states to enable the intensified electronic interaction and strain effect.

Abstract Seawater electrolysis is an effective way for large‐scale green hydrogen. Nevertheless, the anode suffers from the severe corrosion of Cl − and Br − during oxygen evolution, which gives rise to the issues of narrow‐deep pits and shallow‐wide pits, respectively. Herein, an anti‐corrosion strategy is presented by self‐adapting oxyanion armor to prevent the high valence active sites from Cl − and Br − corrosion. The core–shell FeNi 2 Se 4 @NiFe‐Phy is reconstructed to active species NiFeOOH covered by an oxyanion layer composed of phosphoric and carbonate. The aimed anode exhibits remarkable efficiency, achieving current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm −2 at overpotentials of merely 220 and 277 mV, respectively. Notably, it shows unparalleled durability, enduring without any discernible degradation following rigorous testing for 400 h at 400–1000 mA cm −2 in alkaline simulated seawater, as well as natural seawater. A combination of density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations further confirms the bifunctional enhancement of oxyanion armor on NiFeOOH surface. At a current density of 200 mA cm −2 , the alkaline seawater electrolyzer has significant energy efficiency, consuming merely 4.61 and 4.27 kWh Nm −3 H 2 at room temperature and 80 °C, respectively. This work offers an efficacious surface corrosion resistance strategy for anode protection during seawater electrolysis.

Abstract Water oxidation, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is the anodic process in electrocatalytic production of hydrogen and further green fuels. Transition‐metal oxyhydroxides with bulk‐phase OER activity of the complete material or amorphized near‐surface regions are of prime application interest, but their basic electrochemical properties are insufficiently understood. Here the timescale of functional processes is clarified by time‐resolved X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for a thickness‐series of cobalt oxyhydroxides films (about 35–550 nm). At the outer material surface, an electric double‐layer is formed in microseconds followed by clearly cobalt‐centered redox‐state changes of the bulk material in the low millisecond domain and a slow chemical step of O 2 ‐formation, within hundreds of milliseconds. Conceptually interesting, the electrode potential likely controls the OER rate indirectly by driving the catalyst material to an increasingly oxidized state which promotes the rate‐limiting chemical step. Rate constants are derived for redox chemistry and catalysis from EIS data of low‐thickness catalyst films; at higher thicknesses, catalyst‐internal charge transport limitations become increasingly relevant. Relations between electrochemically active surface area, double‐layer capacitance, and redox (pseudo‐)capacitance are discussed. These results can increase the power of EIS analyses and support knowledge‐guided optimization of a broader class of OER catalyst materials.

Considering energy-related technologies including rechargeable batteries and water electrolysis, effective catalytic materials play a crucial role in the rise and unceasing development. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn attention due to their abundant and identical catalytic sites along the periodic network with tunable catalytic functionality and stability. Herein, structural information, catalytic sites, and their corresponding mechanistic pathways have been investigated by employing synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The framework stability, the accessible active sites related to pre-designed metal clusters, the alteration of oxidation state of, and the coordination geometry around the active metal centers evolving along the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are thoroughly revealed. In addition, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising energy storage systems due to their cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness. However, there are some limitations restricting their practical utilizations such as the high activity of water leading to Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution, along with the formation of dendrites on the Zn surface during repeated charge–discharge cycles. To limit parasitic side reactions, an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) protective layer made of a covalent organic framework (COFs) is an effective strategy. Herein, grazing-incidence XAS was employed to specifically characterize the Zn speciation on the electrode surface. According to XAS results, the protective COF-ASEI layer can retard the coordination of water at the electrolyte–Zn interface, improve Zn plating/stripping kinetics, and increase the stability of the Zn anode. This presentation highlights the significance of synchrotron characterizations in energy-related technologies.

Numerous electrochemical catalysts have been manufactured through various combiantions since the past, and they have been used in various fields. Among them, perovskite-based electrochemcial catalysts have high durability and electrochemical properties since they are composed of inorganic oxides. In addition, the electrochemical perovskite catalyst based on the transition metals shows comparable performance with high economic feasibility compared to the precious metal-based catalysts. In this study, double perovskite with a structure of A 2 BB’O 6 containing the existing transition metal in the b-site are utilized to carefully modify the electrochemical properties. In order to utilize tungsten that has excellent electrochemical property, double perovskite structure was used because it is difficult to dope tungsten in a general single perovskite with stable structure. Tungsten is normally equilibrium in the metallic phase, but the oxidation state changes from 4 + to 6 + in the oxide phase when electrons start to move rapidly, consequently boosting the electrochemical property. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a tungsten-based double perovskite catalyst by a solid-state method with calcium(Ca) doped into the b-site to stabilize the perovskite structure. An exsolution method is also applied to form a myriad of metals on the catalyst surface by breaking the meta-oxide bond in the perovskite structure. These metal nanoparticles formed on the surface can promote the activity of the electro chemical catalysts with improved electrochemical properties in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism. To analyze the physical and chemical characteristics, X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rietveld refinement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are carried out. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) system is utilized to confirm the electrochemical performance of the prepared samples. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements, oxygen involved reactions are performed to prove the possibility on the W-based double perovskite materials as an oxygen electrocatalyst for water electrolysis with low-price.

Constructing transition metal multiphase composites can improve the electrocatalytic efficiency of (sea)water splitting via interfacial interaction between adjacent active sites. Herein, the self-supporting NimSn-FeOx heterostructure is in situ grown on nickel foam (NF) through a corrosion engineering approach, which displays abundant dendritic array structures, endowing the material with abundant active sites and high electrocatalytic active area. The control of introducing Fe3+ and sulfur precursors can effectively trigger the phase transiting from Ni3S2 to Ni9S8, generating more S vacancies, which could reduce the reaction energy barrier and improve the electrocatalytic performance. Simultaneously, the presence of Fe–S bonding at the sulfide/oxide interface brings a strong electronic interaction, which enables the tuning of the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates and accelerates the catalytic reaction kinetics. As a result, the Ni9S8–FeOx/NF-Fe8.0 catalyst presents low overpotentials of 159 mV and 190 mV for oxygen evolution reaction at 100 mA cm–2 under 1 M KOH solution and simulated seawater conditions, respectively. The overall water splitting incorporating the Ni9S8–FeOx/NF-Fe8.0 as both anode and cathode provides the potential of 1.707 V in 1 M KOH and 1.794 V in simulated seawater at 100 mA cm–2. This research furnishes an efficient strategy toward the design of advanced transition metal heterogeneous composites with strong interfacial interaction for (sea)water splitting.

Abstract The robust immobilization and activity regulation of molecular catalysts on solid electrodes have remained persistent challenges in catalysis. Herein, cucurbituril (CB[7]) acts is first demonstrated as a bifunctional medium to firmly immobilize molecular catalyst CoTMPyP onto various metal oxide electrodes, including TiO 2 , BiVO 4 , α‐Fe 2 O 3 , and WO 3 , through host‐guest and electrostatic interactions. This approach not only secures stable attachment of the catalyst but also optimizes its electronic structure and catalytic activity. The CB[7]‐mediated supramolecular electrodes exhibit exceptional performance in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), ethanol oxidation reaction, hydrazine oxidation reaction, and photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. For instance, TiO 2 ‐CB[7]‐CoTMPyP electrode achieves a turnover frequency (TOF) of 5.30 s −1 at an overpotential of 600 mV for OER, and BiVO 4 ‐CB[7]‐CoTMPyP photoanode delivers a water oxidation photocurrent density of 6.00 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus RHE under simulated solar irradiation. Mechanistic studies reveal CB[7] plays a critical role beyond merely serving as a linker: it enhances charge accumulation around the cobalt sites, promotes reactants adsorption at these sites, reduces reaction energy barrier, and accelerates charge transfer rate, thereby significantly boosting catalytic activity. This work provides a groundbreaking pathway for the design and fabrication of cost‐effective, high‐performance molecular‐based electrodes for (photo)electrocatalytic reactions.

Advancements in anode development substantially reduce the cost and enhance the performance of water electrolysis. The strategic configuration of nano-sized catalyst materials on anode supports is a pivotal factor in the expansion of the production of catalyst layers and has a significant influence on their electrochemical performance [1–3]. Therefore, it is essential to understand the structure formation mechanisms during electrode fabrication. This contribution aims to explore the inherent drying mechanisms in the coating process and their subsequent influence on the morphological evolution of anodes, ultimately establishing a linkage between these morphological changes and electrochemical performance and stability metrics. The initial phase of the study involved a detailed characterization of commercial nickel cobalt oxide nanoparticles via advanced analytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy [4]. Subsequently, a stable ink was formulated by dispersing the catalyst alongside a binder in a solvent, which was then uniformly applied to a conductive nickel plate utilizing an ultrasonic spray coater. Prior to application, the catalyst inks underwent optimization based on the Hansen solubility parameters of catalyst materials [5, 6] and subsequent visualization of their stability and dispersibility characteristics through transmittogram analysis [7]. The drying process of the coating was conducted at two distinct temperatures, 50 °C and 150 °C, to investigate the effect of temperature on solvent evaporation. Morphological and structural analyses of the anodes were subsequently performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser scanning microscopy (LSM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), providing insight into the alterations induced by the drying process. The analyses conducted in this study elucidate significant modifications in the morphology of the layer structures attributable to variations in drying temperatures as illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, lower temperature resulted in reduced evaporation rates that facilitated the formation of larger, isolated regions/islands on the anode support. These are indicative of a non-uniform coating distribution. In contrast, a higher temperature promoted rapid evaporation, resulting in a quite homogeneous distribution of smaller islands accompanied by the emergence of voids within the anode layer. Electrochemical analysis revealed that these morphological changes are of vital importance: they govern the wetting behaviour and the dynamics of bubble formation which are important for the electrochemical performance and durability of the catalyst layers. Moreover, the insights gleaned from this study are instrumental in identifying optimal configurations of catalyst layer structures, i.e., features that should be maintained during scale-up. In conclusion, this study significantly advances the field by revealing novel principles governing the design and optimization of electrode structures for the oxygen evolution reaction. In particular, the complicated relationship between drying temperatures and morphological evolution, which significantly influences electrochemical performance is explained. References [1] V.

Nitrogenous compounds, such as NH 4 + /NH 3 and NO 3 - , are significant contaminants in water resources. An excess of NH 3 leads to eutrophication which poses a threat to aquatic organisms. Electrochemical oxidation has emerged as a promising water treatment technology, offering advantages such as simplicity, small-scale operation, and minimal reliance on additional chemicals. In this study, a nickel-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) was synthesized using 2-aminoterephthalic acid (BDC-NH 2 ) and nickel nitrate. The Ni-MOF was further carbonized to produce nickel oxide and nitrogen-enriched carbon composite, NiO x @NC. Ni ions recrystallized as core-shell nickel oxide/nickel within the 2D mesoporous carbon texture, which served as active sites for ammonia oxidation. Results of characterization showed that the Ni-MOF exhibited a hexagonal and flaky nanoparticle morphology. With increasing pyrolysis temperature, the electrochemical surface area of NiO x @NC significantly increased as to improve the rate of ammonia oxidation. The primary mediator of Ni(OH) 2 ⇌NiOOH phase transition occurred at +1.2 V, compared to oxygen evolution at +1.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO), thereby enhancing the Faradaic efficiency. Batch electrolysis was conducted under parameters, including pyrolysis temperatures, pH, current density, initial concentration, and electrode potential. Among these, NiO x @NC(700), treated at 700 °C, was the best electrode for decomposing ammonium nitrogen of 50 mg-N/L to below 1 ppm within 4 hours at 3 mA/cm 2 and pH 10. Oxygenated species, such as nitrate and nitrite, negligibly formed, with N 2 nitrogen selectivity surpassing 90% in a paired electrochemical cell assisted with a Cu/Ni cathode. Figure 1

Anthropogenic climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-based processes highlights the importance for alternative synthesis pathways for platform chemicals. Electrochemical CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution offer sustainable options for platform chemical synthesis. However, pairing of the reduction reactions is often done with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which consumes a major share of the total energy demand without contributing to value creation. In contrast, the partial methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is an energy-efficient alternative to OER, yielding formate as a valuable product. While MOR is often studied in terms of high Faraday efficiencies, little attention is paid to conversion and yield regarding paired processes. In this work, we investigate the oxidation of methanol to formate and examine the influence of different reaction parameters including current density, temperature, flow rate, and electrolyte to increase the yield and conversion towards industrially relevant levels. Hierarchically structured CuO foam electrodes (5x5cm²) were employed as the MOR anode. To this end, electrochemically deposited dendrites on a fine-pored copper foam were subsequently oxidized to provide a large surface area for the MOR. The electrode was positioned within an electrochemical cell to ensure continuous flow through the foam, thereby utilizing the high electrode surface area. A defined electrolyte volume was recirculated through the cell and product analysis was conducted via Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for calculation of methanol conversion and Faradaic efficiency (FE) to formate. Increasing the current density from 50 to 200 mA/cm² led to a decrease in the initial FE and final conversion from 92% to 76% and 88% to 85%, respectively. Conversely, elevating temperature from 25 °C to 55 °C increased FE from 83% to 93% and conversion from 74% to 83%. A raise of the electrolyte flow rate from 25 to 100 mL/min showed no impact on FE and conversion. Change in electrolyte composition revealed a negative correlation between KOH concentration and FE, decreasing from 91% to 64% with a rise from 1 M to 4 M KOH. Conversely, increasing MeOH concentration from 0.5 M to 2 M enhanced FE from 71% to 92%. Finally, MOR was paired with alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using two different membrane types, either a bipolar membrane (BPM) or an anion exchange membrane (AEM). Operating at optimized conditions resulting from the previous investigations (100 mA/cm², 55 °C, 50 mL/min, 2 M KOH, and 1 M MeOH), both setups achieved over 90% methanol conversion before the FE dropped to zero. The BPM approach exhibited slightly higher initial FE (over 95%) compared to the AEM approach (over 86%), with respective yields of 70% and 68% at anodic potentials of 1.49 V and 1.33 V. This study provides valuable insights into the influence of reaction conditions on methanol oxidation to formate regarding industrially relevant conversions. Furthermore, the study successfully demonstrates two concepts of pairing HER as the value-adding cathode reaction with MOR as an additional value-adding anode reaction for future applications.    

    

## Charting New Pathways to Form Wolf–Rayet Stars at Low Metallicities

Low-metallicity Wolf–Rayet (WR) populations, such as the one of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), are expected to be slightly influenced by metallicity-dependent effects, such as envelope inflation, which typically positions stars at cooler temperatures. Consequently, these populations should be easier to understand from a theoretical point of view. Yet, the observed bimodal temperature distribution of WR stars in the SMC cannot be explained by existing single-star or binary evolution models. To better understand the observed temperature distribution of WR stars in the SMC, the role of the evolutionary secondary and its response to mass transfer is studied here in detail. To achieve this, I calculated a small grid of binary evolution models at the SMC metallicity, that follows the evolution of both the primary and secondary stars in detail. The analysis of the new binary evolution models suggests that hot (T ≈ 100 kK), hydrogen-poor WN-type stars are the descendants of “ordinary” primary stars or secondaries that have accreted less than a few percent of their initial mass. In contrast, moderate-temperature (T ≈ 50 kK) WN stars can emerge through two channels: (i) as former accretors that underwent rejuvenation, altering their interior structure and leading to higher surface oxygen abundances (XO = 20×10−5) after mass-transfer, or (ii) as luminous stars experiencing envelope inflation, that exhibit surface oxygen abundances in accordance with the CNO-equilibrium value (XO = 2×10−5). The first observational evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from the WR star SMC AB 4, whose optical spectra can only be explained with a stellar atmosphere model having a surface oxygen abundance one order of magnitude higher than the CNO-equilibrium value. Following the binary evolution models, secondary stars that have accreted mass relatively conservatively and, thus, got rejuvenated will evolve at low metallicity into WN stars with moderate temperatures and should be accompanied by a compact object. This would imply that the WN-type star SMC AB 4 should have a so far unseen compact companion. Future spectroscopic surveys focusing on surface oxygen abundances and multiplicity among SMC WR stars are key to further understanding massive star evolution and the role of binarity in forming WR stars in low-metallicity environments.

In order to study the dynamic evolution of the “three zones” of spontaneous combustion and the distribution characteristics of oxygen concentration under different advancing distances in the compound goaf of shallow coal seam, through the field measurement of oxygen concentration in the goaf and the analysis of the development law and air leakage mechanism of the overlying rock fractures in the goaf, the calculation model of the compound goaf of shallow coal seam was established by using fluent simulation software. The depth, width, and dynamic evolution of the oxidation zone and oxygen concentration were obtained as the advancing distance increased in the lower and upper goaf, respectively. The results indicate that: in the secondary mining stage, with the increase of the advance distance, the oxidation zones on both sides of the overlying goaf and the lower goaf gradually extend backward, and finally form a “high on both sides, low in the middle” oxygen concentration distribution pattern within 100 m to 500 m of the goaf. At the same position, the width of the oxidation zone in the overlying goaf is less than that in the lower goaf, and the risk of spontaneous combustion is less than that in the lower goaf. After the advancing distance is greater than 100 m, the width of the oxidation zone at the air inlet side of the overlying goaf decreases with the increasing of the advancing distance, and the width of the oxidation zone at the air return side increases, and the width of the oxidation zone at both sides finally tends to be the same, The width of oxidation zone on both sides of the lower goaf increases first and then decreases with the increase of distance. The research results indicate that the evolution law of “three zones” of spontaneous combustion in the composite goaf during the mining process of shallow buried coal seams, and provide reference for preventing and controlling the spontaneous combustion caused by air leakage in the composite goaf in shallow buried depth.

Temperature and oxygen levels drive the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and physiological traits in marine invertebrates, including crustaceans. Environmental conditions are also expected to prompt the adaptive evolution of mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCGs), which are vital for energy production via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. We formally tested for adaptive evolution in mitochondrial protein-coding genes in representatives of the decapod infraorder Achelata, including two spiny lobsters, Panulirus echinatus and Panulirus interruptus , for which we sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes (15,644 and 15,659 bp long, respectively). A phylomitogenomic analysis based on all 13 mitochondrial PCGs for 24 species belonging to the infraorder Achelata, plus an outgroup representing the infraorders Caridea and Nephropidae, supported the monophyly of the genus Panulirus , the families Palinuridae and Scyllaridae, and the infraorder Achelata. Over the strong negative selection background observed for mitochondrial PCGs in the Achelata, signatures of positive selective pressure were detected within PCGs in equatorial Panulirus spp. and deepwater Scyllaridae. In Panulirus spp. inhabiting equatorial latitudes with consistently high temperatures, the Datamonkey analysis RELAX suggested intensified purifying selection strength in 9 of the 13 PCGs and relaxation in purifying selection strength in atp6, while aBSREL, BUSTED, and MEME recovered signatures of positive selection on PCGs within Complex I, III, and IV PCGs. Likewise, in Scyllaridae species inhabiting depths with low oxygen levels, RELAX indicated relaxed selection strength in 6 of the 13 PCGs, while aBSREL, BUSTED, and MEME recovered signatures of positive selection on PCGs within Complexes I, III, IV, and V. Adaptive evolution likely retains mutations that improve protein stability at sustained temperatures and enhance mitochondrial capacity for energy metabolism in low oxygen conditions. These mutations likely optimize the ability of Complex I to pump protons into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, improve electron transfer and proton translocation in Complex III, boost the efficiency with which Complex IV transfers electrons to oxygen to form water, and refine the ability of Complex V to produce energy via oxidative phosphorylation. The newly assembled mitochondrial genomes of P. echinatus and P. interruptus represent new genomic resources to aid the conservation and management of lobsters targeted by major fisheries through applications such as bioprospecting using eDNA sampling and species identification via DNA barcoding. This study also contributes to our understanding of how environmental conditions drive adaptive evolution in spiny and slipper lobster mitochondrial PCGs and supports the notion that mitochondrial protein-coding genes can and do experience adaptive evolution to optimize mitochondrial function in a wide variety of organisms.

Vascular plants and metazoans use selective proteolysis of transcription factors to control the adaptive responses to hypoxia, although through distinct biochemical mechanisms. The reason for this divergence is puzzling, especially when considering that the molecular components necessary to establish both strategies are conserved across the two kingdoms. To explore an alternative evolutionary scenario where plants sense hypoxia as animals do, we engineered a three-components system aimed to target proteins for degradation in an oxygen dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. Applying the synthetic biology framework, we produced a hypoxia-responsive switch independent of endogenous pathways. When applied to control transcription, the synthetic system partially restored hypoxia responsiveness in oxygen-insensitive mutants. Additionally, we demonstrated its potential to regulate growth under flood-induced hypoxia. Our work highlights the use of synthetic biology to reprogram signalling pathways in plants, providing insights into the evolution of oxygen sensing and offering tools for crop improvement under stress conditions.

We study the energy dependence of the total and diffractive neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus cross sections at very high energies. The calculation employs the QCD dipole model and the small-$x$ nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. We show the sensitivity of the nuclear effect quantification on the nuclear setup, and predict up to $\sim 10\%$ nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-oxygen scattering stemming from the nonlinear evolution. Diffractive contribution to the total scattering is small, which is only few percentage. The $\left|q\bar{q}g\right>$ componnent of the $W^{\pm}$ boson is found to contribute significantly to the diffractive process, which reaches up to $\sim 40\%$ of the diffractive cross section.

Lanthanum strontium ferrite (La0.85–xSr0.15AgxFeO3−δ x = 0; LSFO) and its silver-doped derivative (La0.85–xSr0.15AgxFeO3−δ x = 0.05; LASFO) are synthesized using mild conditions by a sol–gel method. Both oxides present a perovskite-like structure with orthorhombic symmetry due to octahedral tilting; thus, the incorporation of silver in the A-site does not significantly modify the perovskite structure. Exsolution of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from LASFO is induced under mild conditions, resulting in Ag@LSFO samples. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveal that the mechanism of exsolution involves the reduction of Ag+ and the concomitant release of oxygen, without altering the oxidation state of Fe, inducing the formation of oxygen vacancies in the perovskite matrix. Homogeneous distribution of AgNPs on the perovskite matrix is observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The thermal evolution of Ag@LSFO proceeds through the progressive increase in oxygen vacancies that become thermally disordered. The study clarifies the mechanism of silver exsolution and the structural changes in lanthanum–strontium ferrite perovskites, providing insights into their potential use in catalytic and energy-related applications.

## Using stable isotopes in deciphering climate changes from travertine deposits: the case of the Lapis Tiburtinus succession (Acque Albule Basin, Tivoli, Central Italy)

Quaternary stable isotope records of marine and lacustrine carbonate deposits as well as speleothems were extensively studied to reconstruct global and regional climatic evolution. This study demonstrates how stable isotope records of travertine provide fundamental information about climate and the consequences of its evolution on groundwater level fluctuations. The deposition of the Lapis Tiburtinus travertine succession occurred during the Late Pleistocene (150–30 ka), coeval with the last activity of the Colli Albani volcanic complex. Two boreholes (Sn1 and Sn2) were drilled into the Acque Albule Basin (23 km E of Rome), crossing the entire Lapis Tiburtinus succession. The Sn1 borehole in the central part of the basin crosscuts a travertine succession of 62.1 m in thickness, while the Sn2 borehole in the southern part of the basin is characterized by a travertine succession 36.3 m in thickness. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios were analysed on 118 samples (59 samples both for Sn1 and Sn2 boreholes) representative of the entire Lapis Tiburtinus travertine succession crossed by the boreholes. Values, measured and correlated in the two drilled boreholes, permitted determination of the sensitivity of the travertine depositional system to glacial and interglacial cycles, unravelling the complex oxygen and carbon cycle dynamic recorded in such sedimentary succession. Moreover, the results obtained correlated with available pollen curves of the Mediterranean area (from the Castiglione crater, 25 km E of Rome). Regional and global oxygen isotope continental and marine curves, calibrated with the stratigraphy of the Acque Albule Basin, and available U/Th dating allow the identification of at least three phases of the last interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 5-MIS5). The carbon isotope record, compared with CO2 flux reconstructed and associated with the volcanic activity of the Colli Albani volcanic complex, instead shows an influence from groundwater level changes. In particular, positive shifts that occurred during arid phases are associated with a lower groundwater level and increased CO2 degassing, inducing a major fractionation effect on carbon isotopes. Instead, the negative shifts occurring during more humid periods indicate the inhibition of CO2 degassing and increase in pressure, attesting to a rise in groundwater level. In this view, travertine deposits, frequently studied to define the tectonic setting and activity of the area where they develop, can thus also be used as a tool to understand climate changes and groundwater variations apparent in their stable oxygen and carbon isotope signature.

Abstract The possibility of reducing energy costs during hydrogen release was realized using a system in which the anodic process of oxygen release was replaced by the process of dissolution of an electronegative metal (aluminum alloy). The rate of hydrogen release on aluminum, among other equal conditions (temperature and concentration of the electrolyte), depends on the polarization of hydrogen release. On aluminum - a metal of the third group of the periodic table of elements, it is high. The dissolution (corrosion) rate of aluminum can be increased by short-circuiting with an electrode with a low hydrogen evolution polarization, such as nickel. The ratio of hydrogen evolution currents on aluminum and nickel was estimated. The effect of alkali concentration and temperature on the current density, polarization and polarizability of electrodes made of aluminum alloy containing Cu, Mg, Mn and Fe was determined. It was shown that in a 0.1 mol l− 1 NaOH solution at a temperature of 20°C, the polarization resistance of hydrogen release on nickel is lower than on aluminum, and the hydrogen release rate on Ni is higher. At high temperatures and sodium hydroxide concentrations, the polarizability of metal dissolution and hydrogen release on aluminum increases sharply and exceeds those on nickel.

The formation of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) presents challenges such as efficiency losses and fine dust emissions in practical iron combustion systems, highlighting the need for deeper understanding of the formation mechanisms and thermochemical conditions. This study combines experiments and multi-scale simulations to analyze NP clouds generated by single iron particles burning in high-temperature oxidizing environments. The ambient gas conditions were provided by a laminar flat flame burner, with post-flame oxygen mole fractions varied between 20, 30, and 40 vol% at a constant temperature of ~1800K. High-speed in-situ diagnostics were used to measure particle size, NP initiation, NP cloud evolution, and microparticle surface temperature history. The experimental setup utilized three 10kHz imaging systems: one for two-color pyrometry and two for diffusive-backlight illumination (DBI), targeting particle size and NP measurements. The findings showcase the powerful capabilities of multi-physics diagnostics in quantifying NP initiation time and temperature, which depend on particle size and ambient oxygen concentration. CFD simulations revealed enhanced convection velocity driven by increased Stefan flow, which transported NPs toward parent iron particles under high-oxygen conditions. This delayed the detection of NP clouds, leading to higher microparticle temperatures at NP initiation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations uncovered FeO2(g) as a key NP precursor, forming when Fe atoms dissociate from the liquid phase. The initial temperature significantly influenced the resulting nanocluster composition, with Fe(II) dominating at higher temperatures and Fe(III) at lower temperatures. This integrated approach enhances understanding of NP formation in iron combustion, offering insights into the conditions affecting nanoparticle characteristics.

Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong SN-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).

Electrocatalytic technology plays an important role in advancing green and sustainable energy. Various significant electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), have huge potential in green energy conversion. However, the conversion efficiency is limited by slow kinetic processes and high reaction overpotentials. Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity is of paramount importance. Based on density functional theory (DFT), theoretical calculations can not only analyze the electrocatalytic reaction processes from the perspective of molecular structure and energy but also provide an in-depth understanding of the electronic structures of the catalysts and establish the structure–activity relationships between catalysts and electrocatalytic reactions. Thus, DFT calculations can offer theoretical basis and guidance for the design and preparation of efficient electrocatalysts. In this chapter, we will introduce some DFT calculation methods and several electrocatalytic reactions, aiming to help readers understand how DFT calculations are applied to electrocatalytic energy conversion.

Abstract Several characterization techniques were performed on a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to relate the performance degradation induced by the membrane-targeted accelerated stress test (AST) to the evolution of electrochemical and physical properties of the electrode. This works investigated the ionomer structure and the proton transport properties. Electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering analysis provided access to the electrode’s nanoscale structure, the distribution of the platinum particle size, the structure of the 2-3 nm thick ionomer film, as well as the location of the water uptake by the electrode. A newly-developed technique using proton desorption under diluted O2 allows to distinguish effectively used active sites for oxygen reduction reaction. Proton transport and dioxygen diffusivity properties were measured using impedance spectroscopy and limiting current technique respectively. The Membrane-AST leads to an increase in the water uptake of the electrode due to a modification of the global structure of the electrode, a reduced platinum surface area, and corrosion of carbon particles. However, it does not alter the ionomer structure. The decrease in performance is partially attributed to the increase in proton resistivity, but mainly due to the limitation of dioxygen transport fostered by the electrode structure modifications.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis (WE) and fuel cells (FCs) stand out as promising technologies for hydrogen generation and utilization, leveraging renewable and sustainable energy sources. A pivotal element in both PEMFC and PEMWE is the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA), comprising catalyst layers (CLs) and a membrane. These CLs facilitate electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, crucial for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in PEMWE and PEMFC. The catalyst ink for CLs consists of electrocatalyst, ionomer dispersion, and additional solvents. Among these components, the choice of solvent significantly influences PEMFC and PEMWE performance, shaping the catalyst ink's properties. In this investigation, we formulated ionomer dispersions for CLs to enhance performance in PEMWE and PEMFC. We scrutinized the effects of solvents in terms of solvation energy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), particle size distribution (PSD), and electrochemical assessment.

Currently, most research on bio-corroded mortar focuses on cyanobacteria and microorganisms in the marine environment, but the specific mechanism of mortar performance at different stages of the specific biological system of marine dominant algae, Enteromorpha-diatom, is still lacking. Therefore, this paper investigates the growth characteristics of Enteromorpha-diatom proliferation organisms and their attachment evolution on mortar. First, the concentration of Enteromorpha spores over 0 to 15 days was studied. Subsequently, the effects of Enteromorpha-diatom on the properties of mortar at different growth stages over 0 to 360 days were investigated through changes in pH, DO (dissolved oxygen), microstructure, mineral composition, and microstructure in the culture medium. The results showed that Enteromorpha-diatom organisms significantly affected the pH and DO in water through photosynthesis and metabolic activities. Additionally, the adhesion of Enteromorpha-diatom organisms significantly impacted the mechanical properties of mortar, with compressive strength decreasing by 46.1% and flexural strength decreasing by 39.0% over 0 to 360 days. Furthermore, the formation of biofilm, deposition of CaCO 3 , and accumulation of organic and inorganic substances altered the microstructure of mortar, changing its electrochemical characteristics. The electric flux change rate was 46.1%, and the internal impedance decreased by 59% over 0 to 360 days.

This case involves a 21-year-old male healthcare student with a medical history of HIV-1 infection for two years and anxiety disorder. He presented to the emergency department with hemoptysis and dyspnea of sudden onset. A thoracic CT scan revealed multiple bilateral nodular ground-glass opacities suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, noninvasive ventilatory support was initiated. A bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the presence of blood. He also showed an elevated troponin I, peaking at 2,915 ng/mL, with no electrocardiographic or echocardiographic abnormalities. Assuming an immune etiology, high-dose corticosteroids were initiated, with three days of methylprednisolone 1 g. However, the entire etiological study for DAH turned out negative. During a follow-up clinical interview, the patient admitted to having self-administered 1 mg of intravenous adrenaline shortly before the onset of symptoms. The patient showed a favorable evolution, with no recurrence of symptoms, allowing for oxygen therapy weaning. A follow-up chest CT on the ninth day of hospitalization showed no significant alterations. This case highlights the importance of a thorough history in determining the etiology of a potentially fatal disease, adding intravenous epinephrine as a potential trigger of hemoptysis due to exogenous agents.

ABSTRACT The electrocatalytic oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) are key processes used in energy storage and conversion. We have developed a highly efficient MnCo 2 O 4 nanostructure anchored with functionalized carbon black (MnCo 2 O 4 / f ‐CB), which has been characterized by XRD, FT‐IR, Raman spectra, FE‐SEM, and HR‐TEM analyses as robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for both HER and OER. At a characteristic 10 mA cm −2 current density, the MnCo 2 O 4 / f ‐CB composite ECs exhibit low overpotentials of 330 mV for OER and 360 mV for HER, respectively. Furthermore, the MnCo 2 O 4 / f ‐CB composite ECs exhibit superior current density, the shortest Tafel slope, and admirable durable stability in OER and HER together. Due to the supported f ‐CB, the MnCo 2 O 4 composite catalyst has more active sites, effective charge transfer, and longer durability. A high‐efficiency dual electrocatalyst can be developed from these highly efficient and dual ECs, which are comparable to standard noble metal–based catalysts. The synergetic coupling effects of high‐activity f ‐CB and MnCo 2 O 4 composites with appropriate morphologies are critical factors for the enhanced catalytic performances of the MnCo 2 O 4 / f ‐CB composite.

Abstract This work used high velocity oxygen fuel spraying technology to prepare three types of ceramic-based self-lubricating sealing coating on C/SiC substrates, with Yttria-stabilized zirconia as the matrix and different mass fractions of Mo and Ag as lubricating phases. The compositions are S1(50%YSZ40%CaF 2 10%Mo), S2(50%YSZ40%CaF 2 10%Ag) and S3 (40%YSZ30%CaF 2 10%Mo10%Ag10%SiO 2 ). The friction coefficient and wear rate of the coating were examined at room temperature (RT), 400°C and 800°C. The effects of different lubricating phases on the tribological properties of the coating were compared. The wear mechanism of the coating under different temperature environments will be revealed by clarifying the evolution law of the microstructure of the coating. The results show that the addition of Ag can improve the lubricating ability of the coating. Ag element forms a continuous and smooth tribo-layer on the sliding surface to reduce the friction coefficient of the coating. In addition, the lubricating effect of Ag element is more significant at medium and low temperatures. At 800°C, the S3 coating with both Ag and Mo exhibited excellent tribological properties. The wear mechanism of the coating is that it starts with adhesive wear and gradually transitions to abrasive wear as friction continues. This work provides theoretical support and experimental evidence for the construction of ceramic-based self-lubricating sealing coating with a wide temperature range.

As an important phenomenon in the evolution of fire, the ghosting flame exhibits dynamic and irregular behavior in environments with limited ventilation. By ghosting flame, we mean the phenomenon where the flame separates from the fuel surface under certain conditions. This study investigates the combustion characteristics of the ghosting flame in pool fires within a coal mine dead-end roadway by small-scale experiments. Results indicate that the ghosting flame appears more readily and earlier when the fire source is closer to the heading face or when the oil pan size is larger. Additionally, the fire source's location significantly influences the type of ghosting flame observed. When the fire source is near the heading face, the flame predominantly exhibits horizontal-type ghosting flame; however, when the fire source is at the entrance of the roadway, only the edge-type ghosting flame occurs. Furthermore, dead-end roadway fires easily transition to ventilation-controlled conditions, leading to a continuous increase in the mass loss rate. The occurrence of a ghosting flame does not result in a sudden change in the mass loss rate. Moreover, the transient oxygen volume fraction when the ghosting flame occurs is related to the ghosting flame type and is also affected by ventilation conditions, fuel types, roadway structure, and the location of measurement points. Importantly, the root cause for the occurrence of the ghosting flame lies in the pressure differential generated by the temperature disparity between the two sides of the fire source.

Each cell in the human body is continually exposed to harmful external and internal factors. During evolution, cells have developed various defence systems, divided into enzymatic and non-enzymatic types, to which low-weight molecule antioxidants belong. In this article, the ionisation potential and electron affinity, as well as global reactivity descriptors of Vitamin C, Melatonin, Uric Acids, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, were theoretically investigated at the MP-2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory in the condensed (aqueous) phase. The vertical ionisation potential and electron affinity are discussed in terms of non-equilibrated and equilibrated solvent–solute interactions. Additionally, at the same theoretical level, the electronic properties of canonical and oxidised derivatives of guanine were analysed. The presented results indicate that the selected antioxidants for this study (Vitamin C, Uric Acid, NAC, and Melatonin) exhibit the highest adiabatic electron affinity, while guanine derivatives (Gua, OXOGua, Guo, dGuo, OXOGuo, OXOdGuo) are more prone to adiabatic radical cation formation. A red-ox balance (redox homeostasis) is crucial for intracellular signalling pathways that are reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RO/NS)-dependent. Should this gentle balance be disrupted, either by an overload or deficit of species, physiological consequences may result, which in turn lead to pathological outcomes. On the other hand, maintaining the stability of the above balance of antioxidants/radicals may result in the improved effectiveness and safety of anticancer radiotherapy/chemotherapy or combined therapies with a subsequent increase in a patient’s quality of life.

Abstract Investigations of the metabolic capabilities of anaerobic protists advances our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic life on Earth and for uncovering analogous extraterrestrial complex microbial life. Certain species of foraminiferan protists live in environments analogous to early Earth conditions when eukaryotes evolved, including sulfidic, anoxic, and hypoxic sediment porewaters. Foraminifera are known to form symbioses as well as to harbor organelles from other eukaryotes (chloroplasts), possibly bolstering the host’s independence from oxygen. The full extent of foraminiferal physiological capabilities is not fully understood. To date, evidence for foraminiferal anaerobiosis was gleaned from specimens first subjected to stresses associated with removal from in situ conditions. Here, we report comprehensive gene expression analysis of benthic foraminiferal populations preserved in situ on the euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) bathyal seafloor, thus avoiding environmental alterations associated with sample recovery, including pressure reduction, sunlight exposure, warming, and oxygenation. Metatranscriptomics, metagenome-assembled genomes, and measurements of substrate uptake were used to study the kleptoplastidic foraminifer Nonionella stella inhabiting sulfur-oxidizing bacterial mats of the Santa Barbara Basin, off California. We show N. stella energy generation under dark euxinia is unusual because it orchestrates complex metabolic pathways for ATP production and carbon fixation through the Calvin cycle. These pathways include extended glycolysis, anaerobic fermentation, sulfide oxidation, and the presence of a membrane-bound inorganic pyrophosphatase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes inorganic pyrophosphate to actively pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane.

Tuning active site electronic structures is crucial to the efficient interconversion of electrochemical energy. The recent discovery of flat electronic bands in stacked atomically thin layers of graphene has sparked unprecedented interest in moiré superlattices with small twist angles (0.22º < theta < 5º). 1 A recent work in electrocatalysis demonstrated enhancement of hydrogen evolution using Ru embedded in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) nanosheets. 2 In this talk, we explore moiré superlattice effects for applications in PGM-free fuel cell cathode catalysts, where molecular oxygen is electrochemically reduced at the catalyst-electrolyte interfaces (i.e., oxygen reduction reaction, ORR) to power polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The activity, stability, and affordability of catalysts are current bottlenecks at the materials level that prevent widespread adoption of PEFCs in the clean energy sector. Replacing rare and expensive Pt/C catalysts with graphene-based structures would greatly aid in addressing cost, but co-optimization in the activity and stability of such structures is required. We will discuss the theoretical and computational framework needed to unveil the mechanisms and merits of TBG as an effective material platform for realizing highly active and stable ORR precious metal free catalysts. This includes the feasibility of driving 4 electrons ORR pathways on TBG systems as a function of twist angle, which will provide us with an activity descriptor. For structures demonstrating feasible 4 electrons reduction pathway, we will further explore stability against metal dissolution. These efforts enable us to explore the existence of “magic angles” of TBG in ORR applications. This work will leverage our prior efforts in developing activity and stability descriptors for electrocatalyst and atomically dispersed systems. 3–6 We will also combine uncertainty quantification approaches with multi-objective Bayesian optimization to navigate the TBG structural-chemical material space and suggest new synthesis target structures exhibiting both high activity and stability.

Underground reservoirs were used to purify water through filtration, adsorption, and biodegradation methods in coal mines. However, their effects on the composition and metabolism of microbial communities in mine water remain unknown. In this study, influent and effluent samples from underground reservoirs in seven coal mining areas were analyzed to compare their microbial community compositions and metabolites. The results indicate that the underground reservoirs can significantly reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels of mine water (values range from 7.79 to 8.50 for influent and 7.40 to 8.50 for effluent) and regulate water chemistry characteristics such as pH (values range from 7–1980 for influent and 5–20 for effluent). Since COD reflects the quantity of reducing substances in water, while total dissolved solids (TDS) indicates the total amount of dissolved solids, both parameters directly influence the physicochemical properties of water. This, in turn, affects microbial growth and metabolic pathways. Consequently, changes in these factors can lead to variations in microbial community composition as well as decreases in the Chao1 and Shannon indices. Underground reservoirs decreased the relative abundance of phyla Actinomycetota and Spirochaetota, and the decreased microbial groups were mainly belonging to phylum Bacillota. In addition, higher concentrations of metabolites, including lipids and lipid-like molecules, mixed metal/nonmetal compounds, hydrocarbon derivatives, nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues were detected in the effluent samples, and most of them were related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, selenocompound metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, and the citrate cycle. In summary, this study provided theoretical and experimental support for the evolution mechanism of mine water quality in coal mine underground reservoirs.

In the context of climate change, reducing the environmental impact of agriculture has become increasingly critical. To ensure sustainable food production, it is essential to adopt cultivation techniques that maximize resource efficiency, particularly in water and nutrient usage. The Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) is one such hydroponic system, designed to optimize water and nutrient use, making it a valuable tool for sustainable agriculture. This bibliometric review examines the evolution of NFT research from 1977 to 2023, focusing on the growing interest in this method as a solution to the agricultural challenges posed by climate change. Through the analysis of 774 scientific documents, this review highlights an upward trend in NFT-related studies, with a noticeable shift from conference proceedings to peer-reviewed journal articles, particularly in recent years. Acta Horticulturae has been a leading journal in this field, underscoring the significance of early conference contributions. Lettuce and tomatoes have emerged as the primary crops studied in NFT systems, demonstrating the technique’s broad applicability. Research on lettuce has primarily focused on nitrate accumulation and biofortification, aiming to improve both the nutritional quality and safety of the crop. Studies on tomatoes have explored challenges related to oxygen concentration in the nutrient solution, where innovations such as the Nutrient Drip Technique (NDT) and the New Growing System (NGS) have shown promise in addressing these issues. Other key areas of NFT research include the effects of water salinity on crop growth and the integration of NFT with aquaponics systems, highlighting its potential for sustainable, water-efficient crop production. However, challenges such as nutrient imbalances and disease management persist. This review underscores the growing relevance of NFT in the pursuit of environmentally sustainable agriculture. Continued innovation and research are essential to optimizing nutrient management, refining environmental controls, and exploring new crop varieties, thereby enhancing the potential of NFT for sustainable farming systems.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a severe and debilitating complication that can occur in patients undergoing radiotherapy to treat head and neck cancers. Characterized by bone necrosis associated with radiation exposure, ORN results in chronic pain, persistent infections and, in severe cases, pathological fractures and disfigurement. Dental intervention plays a crucial role in both the prevention and treatment of ORN. Pre-radiotherapy dental assessment, including preventive dental procedures and the removal of compromised teeth, is essential to reduce the risk of ORN. During and after radiotherapy, continuous dental monitoring, strict maintenance of oral hygiene and the use of adjuvant therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, are essential to minimize the risk of developing ORN. Modern radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), have been shown to be effective in reducing the radiation dose to healthy tissues, reducing the incidence of ORN. Collaboration between oncologists, dental surgeons and other health professionals is crucial for the effective management of osteoradionecrosis. Early identification of signs and symptoms allows for faster interventions and improves the patient's prognosis. In addition, continuous patient education on oral care is essential for long-term prevention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of current practices and to the development of more effective approaches to the management of osteoradionecrosis, emphasizing the importance of the dental surgeon's role in the multidisciplinary team. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a literature review, which looked at articles published in the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline/Pubmed) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo) databases. Terms such as: "Dentistry"; "Osteoradionecrosis"; "Cancer"; "Head and neck cancer"; "Treatment protocols" were used, covering the period from 2019 to 2023. Ro 2023, resulting in a total of 35 articles using the Qualis Periódicos evaluation criteria. RESULTS: Based on the data collected, it is possible to observe that the dental surgeon has the role of minimizing or even combating the progression of oral diseases that spread the evolution of ORN, through appropriate oral hygiene guidance that precedes the start of radiotherapy. Prior dental practice is of great importance so as not to compromise the methodology of the cancer treatment prescribed to the patient. CONCLUSION: The researched studies show that the dental surgeon, as a member of the oncology team, should work early in radiotherapy, with the aim of reducing the progression of the disease through oral hygiene guidance, periodic visits to the dentist, avoiding the progression of periodontal diseases and exodontia during the period of radiotherapy treatment.

Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic had a widespread global impact and presented numerous challenges. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has changed transmission rates and immune evasion, possibly impacting the severity. This study aims to investigate the impact of variants on clinical outcomes in southern Brazil. Methods In total, samples from 277 patients, hospitalized and non-hospitalized, were collected between March 2020 and March 2021, before the vaccine was made widely available to the general population in Brazil. Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was performed and bioinformatics and biostatistics analyses were implemented on molecular and clinical data, respectively. Results The study identified significant demographic and clinical differences. The hospitalized group exhibited a higher proportion of males (51.9%) and an increased prevalence of comorbidities, including hypertension (66.0%), obesity (42.6%), and chronic kidney disease (23.6%). Patients were identified with twelve SARS-CoV-2 strains, predominantly B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 in the early 2020 first wave, and P.1 overlapping in the late 2020 and early 2021 second wave of COVID-19. Significant differences in hospitalization rates were found among patients infected with the different SARS-CoV-2 lineages: B.1.1.33 (46.0%), B.1.1.28 (65.9%), and P.1 (97.9%). Severity markers, such as pneumonia (62.5%, p=0.002), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 72.9%, p&lt;0.001), and oxygen support &gt;6 L/min O 2 (64.6%, p&lt;0.001), were more frequent in patients from the second wave. These findings highlight the impact of different variants on the clinical evolution and prognosis of COVID-19, especially when comparing the first and second waves of the pandemic. Conclusions The study underscores the association between SARS-CoV-2 strains and COVID-19 severity by integrating clinical and viral data for public health responses during different pandemic phases, highlighting the importance of adapting pandemic strategies as the pandemic evolves.

The Southern Ocean plays a key role in atmospheric CO2 sequestration, accounting for ~40-50% of the anthropogenic CO2 absorbed by the modern ocean (Landschützer et al., 2015;Gruber et al., 2019). The Southern Ocean also played a critical role in modulating variation in the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in the geologic past on both orbital and millennial timescales (Anderson et al., 2009;Sigman et al., 2010;Gottschalk et al., 2016).Moreover, the Southern Ocean influences atmospheric and oceanic circulation in the tropics remotely, including low-latitude atmospheric CO2 exchange (Sarmiento et al., 2004;Hendry and Brzezinski, 2014;Sigman et al., 2021). Thus, the Southern Ocean is a key component of the global climate system through its influence on atmospheric CO2 variations at a range of timescales (Fischer et al., 2010;Rae et al., 2018;Dong et al., 2024) processes. These articles can be classified into the three themes explored below.Li et al. analyzed sea-surface temperature (SST) data from the Southern Ocean since 1870 to resolve why SSTs have been cooling since 1980 despite a global warming trend (Yang et al., 2023). They found that three main modes (i.e., the Global Temperature Anomaly, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) can explain over 70% of SST variability. The negative phase of the AMO and the positive phase of the ENSO counteract the effects of global warming, resulting in a cooling trend in Southern Ocean SSTs since 1980.Zhang et al. identified strong seasonal variations of siliceous microplankton fluxes and radiolarian assemblages from a sediment trap, which are dominated by seasonality in sea ice cover and plankton community composition in Prydz Bay polynya, Antarctica. The results of this study provide new insights concerning the fluxes and assemblages of siliceous microplankton as carbon-cycle proxies in the geological past (Ragueneau et al., 2000;Tréguer et al., 2017).Fe (FeHR) and organic carbon in surface sediments from Prydz Bay and the adjacent Southern Ocean. They discovered that the FeHR to total Fe (FeT) ratios are lowest for the surface sediments in the global ocean due to weak bedrock weathering and slow glacier melting. They proposed that the influence of FeHR on sedimentary organic matter significantly varies across different sedimentary environments and sediment categories. high versus low FeHR/FeT, respectively), which are linked to lower Fe solubility and primary production in the water column and to greater carbonate dilution/dissolution at proximal versus distal sites. This study underscores the significance of Fe dynamics in regulating glacialinterglacial atmospheric pCO2 variation in multiple oceanic regions, particularly in the Southern Ocean, where variation in dust delivery on glacial-interglacial timescales is pronounced (Lamy et al., 2014;Martínez-García et al., 2014).The influence of the Southern Ocean on atmospheric pCO2 and global climate evolution is complicated, being related not only to the carbon cycle but also to the nitrogen and silicon cycles, sulfur and oxygen cycles, iron cycle, hydrological cycle, and icesheet/ice shelf dynamics. The articles collected on this Research Topic represent state-of-the-art investigations into the above-mentioned biogeochemical and dynamic processes at a range of timescales based on modern observations, paleoclimate data, and model simulations. These collective efforts are of great scientific significance in providing new insights concerning the role of the Southern Ocean in modulating variations in atmospheric pCO2 and global climate in the past, present and future. Despite the progress made by the studies in this Research Topic, key scientific issues remain incompletely understood and will require further investigation in the future in order to achieve a better understanding of the role of the Southern Ocean in global climate change from the perspective of the carbon cycle.

Geographical distribution of authors for the articles in the Applied Materials Portfolio Journals' Early Career Forum.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThis Forum highlights groundbreaking research and innovative ideas from the emerging authors in the scientific community. A broad range of topics are covered, among these, energy and biorelated research take center stage, with a significant number of papers dedicated to these fields. Given the diversity of the topics, it is challenging to single out individual contributions. Instead, I have approached this by analyzing the prevailing trends across the Forum.Energy research is undergoing a transformative phase, fueled by advancements in catalysts, photocatalysts, batteries materials, and fabrication techniques. These breakthroughs are driving innovations in energy storage, harvesting, and conversion technologies, offering sustainable and efficient solutions for the future. Multifunction catalysts and photocatalysts materials are unlocking new potential in applications such as zinc–air batteries, hydrogen production, and water splitting. (1−4)Progress in advanced photovoltaic materials, including perovskites and photonic nanomaterials, is accelerating renewable energy technologies. Thermoelectric materials enable the conversion of low-grade heat into usable energy, whereas lightweight, flexible materials, such as 2D structures and thin-film polymers, are paving the way for scalable solar films and stretchable thermoelectric generators. (5−7)In biomaterials, different types of nanoparticles are revolutionizing cancer therapy, imaging, and biosensor technologies. Stimuli-responsive materials are employed for targeted drug delivery and advanced medical applications. Meanwhile, bioinks and 3D-printed biomaterials are driving breakthroughs in tissue engineering and wound healing, combining biocompatibility with functional properties to support regenerative medicine. (8−12)I would like to highlight a few noteworthy articles in key themes such as energy, catalysis, and device technologies. In a perspective, Xin et al. discuss nonconventional electrochemical reactions in rechargeable lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, addressing the challenge of unstable polysulfide intermediates. The authors review innovative strategies to enhance battery stability and performance, focusing on modifications to sulfur allotropes, electrolyte composition, and electrode design. (13) In a related study, Shi et al. investigate the nucleation mechanisms of lithium pits and their morphological evolution across large electrode areas. Their findings reveal that overpotential is inversely related to pit radius and exponentially related to nucleation rate, offering new insights for predicting and controlling surface area and roughness in lithium electrodes under various stripping conditions (Figure 2). (14)Figure 2Figure 2. Selected graphics from ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces Early Career Forum, showcasing energy-related research, including studies on lithium–sulfur batteries and lithium pit nucleation.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideIn the rapidly growing area of electronics, two particularly exciting fields─optoelectronic synapses and heat harvesting─are showcased. Xu and co-workers present an organic optoelectronic synapse with multilevel memory, enabled by gate modulation. It mimics synaptic plasticity with both volatile and nonvolatile states, transitioning between short-term and long-term plasticity through gate voltage and light exposure. The device offers program/erase current ratios and stability, making it a promising candidate for neuromorphic systems in image processing and memory retention (Figure 3A). (15) In parallel, Cai et al. introduce a heat harvesting system that combines daytime radiative cooling with thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC). Using nanoporous polyethylene and MXene, the system passively generates a 35 °C temperature difference under sunlight, converting ambient heat into continuous electricity with a 50 mV cell voltage and over 20 mAh/g specific capacity, without external charging (Figure 3B).

Despite the challenges posed by vast geographical distances and relatively small populations (Australia: 26 million, New Zealand: 5 million), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) are renowned for their high quality innovative pediatric intensive care research. A strong culture of partnership across units led to the formation of the ANZ Intensive Care Society Paediatric Study Group (ANZICS PSG) in 2003, which has evolved since its formation into one of the leading international pediatric intensive care trial networks, along with two in the United States (1,2) and one in the United Kingdom (3). Here, we describe the factors leading to the growth of the ANZICS PSG, explore the current established research ecosystem, along with future plans to sustain success. ORIGINS OF ANZICS PSG The ANZICS PSG was established in 2003 as a working group of the ANZICS Clinical Trials Group (CTG), which had been in existence since 1993. This administrative change recognized the need for an organized research network of PICUs in ANZ. All PSG Member PICUs were based in specialist pediatric, nonprofit, public, university teaching hospitals. By 2003, ANZ already had established a centralized training body for pediatric intensive care medicine (initially as a Joint Faculty of the ANZ College of Anaesthetists and Royal Australasian College of Physicians started in 1998, and subsequently as a stand-alone College of Intensive Care Medicine in 2001). Recognition of the importance of clinical research for physicians in subspecialty training was underscored by the requirement that trainees had to carry out a research project. The College of Intensive Care Medicine set expectations and standards for ANZ PICUs, including recommendations for permanent Data Manager and Research Coordinator positions in all PICUs. Since the inaugural meeting of the ANZICS PSG in Sydney, New South Wales in 2003, representation was broadened to ensure inclusion of Research Coordinators and Nurse Researchers, as well as regional representatives. In 1998, the CTG had recognized the pivotal role of Research Coordinators in the design, management, and conduct of clinical trials in adult ICUs in ANZ. Soon after, it formed the Intensive Care Research Coordinators Interest Group to facilitate peer-led guidance necessary to support isolated individuals providing local clinical research infrastructure. In 2019, the PSG formally instituted a similar Paediatric Intensive Care Research Coordinator Interest Group. Between 2003 and 2023, the ANZICS PSG has endorsed more than 25 studies led by physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and statisticians. ANZICS PSG studies cover a range of research designs, recognizing the importance of a pipeline capable of bridging observational data on burden of disease, consumer engagement, and pilot studies to generate the necessary steps toward high-quality clinical trials (Fig. 1). In 2004 and 2005, the PSG carried out multicenter, prospective observational studies on prevalence of acute lung injury (4) and hyperglycemia (5), which established collaboration between PICUs and processes needed for centralized study management and data collection. Then, from 2006 to 2010, we used this organizational infrastructure to carry out our first phase II multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) of hypothermia therapy for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children (6). Invitation to the PSG to participate in the 2007–2011 phase III international "Cool Kids" (hypothermia vs. normothermia after severe TBI in children) RCT (7) followed and helped to establish the PSG as an international research partner.Figure 1.: Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Paediatric Study Group (PSG) research ecosystem strategy. ANZPICR = Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care Registry, ECR = Early Career Researcher, LTOs = long-term outcomes, MDT = multidisciplinary team.In recent years, like the U.S. and U.K. study groups (1–3), the ANZICS PSG membership has grown and diversified to include dieticians, pharmacists, and physiotherapists, as well as researchers from key academic partners. Working groups have been established to advance and coordinate the research focus and outcomes, the capacity given our population size, and the capability given our resources. We have also included consumer engagement, data science specialists, and new and early career investigators (Fig. 2).Figure 2.: Timeline of key milestones of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Paediatric Study Group (ANZICS PSG) and Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care Registry (ANZPICR). *Australian and New Zealand PICU trial run by a Paediatric Study Group member but not submitted for endorsement.

This provides a strong foundation for embedding the pediatric intensive care research agenda in the broader aims of the Society and its members. In 2003, the PSG found a natural home within the ANZICS CTG, which provided administrative and secretarial support as well as the opportunity to observe and collaborate with the adult intensive care scientific community, which was rapidly gaining a reputation for clinical trials relevant to real world practice. In recent years, exchange between pediatric and adult clinical trialists has helped facilitate the design and conduct of RCTs in children, by targeting the gap between adult ICU and PICU trials, which has enabled pediatric trials to occur even though, previously, they seemed unachievable. For example, in the period 2015 to 2021, adult ICU-inspired pediatric RCTs have investigated the role of vitamin C in sepsis (8), early adrenaline in sepsis (9), a comparison of dexmedetomidine to midazolam for sedation (10), and the use of high-flow during intubation (11). Seasoned CTG trialists provide mentorship, not only for the conduct of trials, but also for early career research development. The CTG has demonstrated that the path to sustainable, world-leading intensive care research is developed by network wide collaboration, a strong sense of partnership, dedication to fostering novice researchers, and regular face-to-face meetings. The annual CTG Scientific Meeting, conducted in Noosa (a resort town in Queensland, Australia), enables pediatric researchers to propose study designs, develop ideas, seek critical input and support for trials, and leverage the expertise of both adult and pediatric research groups to enhance research methodology. THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE REGISTRY The Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care Registry (ANZPICR) was founded in 1996. Its history has played an important part in the evolution of the PSG. It started with the development of the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM), a locally derived and validated prediction mortality score, requiring information from consecutive admissions to all seven specialist PICUs in Australia between 1994 and 1996 (12). This work was instrumental in enabling an international comparison between two models of PICU care: the distributed provision across Trent, United Kingdom, vs. the centralized model in Victoria, Australia (13). Based on 1994–1995 risk-adjusted mortality the authors demonstrated a possible excess mortality in the decentralized model of PICU organization. Subsequent iterations to PIM occurred in 2003 and 2013, PIM 2 (14) and PIM 3 (15), respectively. Now, the ANZPICR dataset is a health service mandatory requirement with central data quality checks that includes any and all ICUs admitting children. This process has fostered standardization of care, clinical collaboration, and benchmarking of practice. ANZICS PSG research using ANZPICR data has always been carried out as a collaborative undertaking between the PSG and ANZPICR. This activity has strengthened PSG productivity with observational studies in its early years and given ANZPICR clinicians' data to undertake secondary research. These investigations have assessed burden of disease (16), changes in therapies, diseases, and outcomes (17,18), and explored outcomes in specific diseases or populations (19–22). ANZPICR data are a frequently used and valuable resource for researchers providing accurate, contemporary, and population-based information about potential study participant numbers, use of individual therapies, and ICU and hospital outcomes. In recent years, the linkage of additional datasets with the comprehensive ANZPICR dataset, spanning more than 2 decades of PICU admission in ANZ, has uncovered in-depth insights into the risk factors and consequences of critical illness in children, which can inform future research and practice (23,24). Building on this extensive experience and sustainably funded registry, the focus of the ongoing PSG and ANZPICR partnership is now turning toward registry-embedded trials and how registry data and infrastructure might be used to collect short- and long-term outcomes for RCTs. As ANZPICR embarks on collection of long-term nonmortality outcomes (https://www.anzics.org/patient-reported-outcomes-and-experience-measures/), incorporation of core outcome sets to improve consistency and completeness of outcome data for clinical trials is gaining traction (25). EVOLUTION OF ANZICS PSG RCTs Over the past decade, the PSG has undergone an evolution in use of trial designs, marked by the transition from pilot studies, to traditional RCTs, with a more recent move toward incorporating digital and pragmatic trial strategies using innovative design (Fig. 2). This journey has been propelled by several success factors. First, the cultivation of a collective ethos, fostering collaboration and enthusiasm among multidisciplinary teams across ANZ PICUs and academic partners. Accordingly, in recent years, we have witnessed an increase in the diversity of professions leading ANZICS PSG studies. This has resulted in a balanced portfolio of studies addressing a more comprehensive range of clinical questions along the patient journey compared with earlier studies by our group. Second, our increasing familiarity with interventional trials has enabled confidence and a "can do attitude" that has led to increased sample sizes, and the ability to move from small-scale pilot studies to comprehensive trials that encompass diverse patient populations. Lessons gleaned from our catalogue of RCTs (6,8,11,26–28), and the timeline (Fig. 2), have not only provided invaluable insights into the development of robust trial methodologies, key criteria for successful collaboration, and utility of pilot work, but additionally fostered trust and collegiality in our collaborations, and created a spirit where performing RCTs in critically ill children is considered an essential component of PICU practice, rather than being burdensome. Third, the employment of pragmatic research designs (29) has facilitated empowerment and agency for PICU clinical teams and families, and has demonstrated feasibility of conducting interventional research in a high-risk context, such as acute cardiopulmonary bypass surgery where a consent rate of 73% was achieved (26). Fourth, we have benefited considerably from the implementation and research of alternative consent models, notably consent-to-continue (8,11,28), using similar approaches to studies led from the U.K. Paediatric Critical Care Society Study Group (3). By embracing novel consent frameworks, we have enhanced recruitment rates and streamlined trial processes while upholding ethical standards and safeguarding participant rights. However, consent-to-continue models remain challenged in some jurisdictions in ANZ, which represents an ongoing risk to the sustainability of effective interventional research in our setting. Finally, in the absence of a national trial unit comparable to the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre in the United Kingdom, we have sought to leverage each ANZICS PSG study to develop a more sustainable trial infrastructure, developing a comprehensive modular package of digital solutions, including a Research Electronic Data Capture-embedded platform for enabling high-quality data capture, optimizing efficiency in trial methodology and infrastructure. Additionally, the pandemic experience has underscored the importance of remote monitoring capabilities and propelled our methodological research investigating research monitoring practices (30,31). This research underpins innovation in best-practice approaches to risk-based research monitoring, can streamline ethical approval, facilitate effective interaction with Data Safety Monitoring Boards, and enhance reproducibility of trial data. These collective advances have strengthened streamlined data collection and standardization, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of our research endeavors. To enable more robust strategic planning and focus, in 2020, the PSG conducted a research prioritization exercise, to define key areas of research for children in intensive care in ANZ (32). A three-stage modified Delphi survey followed by face-to-face meeting with Hanlon prioritization was completed by 193 medical and nursing members aiming to rank key themes of research as well as important outcomes. Examples of key themes included fluid and vasoactive therapies, family experience, care of staff, respiratory therapies such as oxygen, and quality improvement initiatives. Key prioritized outcomes in terms of feasibility included short-term mortality, resource use (PICU and hospital length of stay, duration of ventilation), and, in terms of overall priority, long-term survival with good neurodevelopment and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as patient centered outcomes. This process provided the groundwork for developing a common framework for future research design and collaboration within the PSG. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER PICU: TOWARD LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP An increase in survival rates over the last 2 decades has seen a shift away from mortality as a primary outcome and inclusion of the longer-term impacts of critical illness (33). The identification of HRQoL and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes as critical for progressing research in the field, led to the formation of a PSG Long-term Outcomes Working Group (32). Currently, ANZ PICUs do not provide PICU follow-up services; recruitment into PSG research studies offering long-term follow-up is thus providing an emerging model of care to an underserved population. Accordingly, long-term outcomes have been included as secondary outcomes in most recent PSG trials where acute outcomes, such as ventilator-free days, are typically the primary outcome (8,26,34). In addition to HRQoL, we have developed a suite of validated questionnaires for follow-up by proxy incorporating more comprehensive domains under the post-intensive care syndrome-pediatrics framework such as adaptive/cognitive and behavioral function as well as family functioning and post-traumatic stress (35). As our understanding of the risk factors, biology, and long-term effects of interventions during critical illness remains incomplete, we are currently conducting a 5-year follow-up of the Nitric Oxide During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Improve Recovery in Infants with Congenital Heart Defects (NITRIC) trial population using annual surveys, followed by face-to-face neuropsychologic assessment (36). Complementary to the above studies, we have endeavored in recent years to conduct observational and interventional trials primarily focused on long-term outcomes; including surveys, cohort studies, data linkage, and clinical trials of follow-up models of care (23,24,36,37). Analyzing over 5000 PICU survivors, features related to socioeconomic status emerged as a key feature associated with long-term educational outcomes in addition to critical illness features in our population. While ANZ are considered high-income countries, inequalities persist and disproportionately affect the Indigenous populations of both countries, extending into worse health outcomes for critically ill children (21). A research agenda aiming to improve long-term outcomes for critically ill children in the ANZ setting thus needs to be optimized given the unique context of the ANZ population, geography, and consumer-identified needs to avoid recruitment and follow-up bias by social determinants of health. While parent-based questionnaires are not the gold standard of child development assessment, they provide the ability to collect the more nuanced outcomes of development that global assessments on HRQoL or overall function may miss, at a relative cost saving to the research budget (33). With growing evidence of significant premorbid impairments, our current studies to measure HRQoL and neurodevelopment at baseline aim to accurately determine the impact of the PICU admission and interventions above that already experienced by the child. INTEGRATING AND PRIORITIZING CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT In response to the increasing involvement of consumers in research development, design, implementation, and dissemination, the PSG Consumer Working Group was established in 2018. The group aims to encourage and support consumer involvement in PICU research by helping researchers to engage meaningfully with consumers and to identify the priorities and needs of patients and their families involved in PICU research. This process also provides an opportunity to build on previous experiences and iteratively improve the approach to consumer engagement, as well as avoiding uncoordinated contacts with families at risk of "consumer fatigue." This project has moved from a process of consultation with consumers on documentation and study videos (26) to their inclusion in study design, study oversight as members of Steering Committees (8), contributors to the critical care quality outcomes set (25), and follow-up design and conduct. The NITRIC follow-up study (35) has worked in partnership with consumers and consumer advocacy groups in elements of study design including development of study documentation and contact processes as well as designing the final aspects of the study aiming to explore families' experience of participation in the study. THE FUTURE: HOW ANZICS PSG WILL SUSTAIN AND GROW Four pillars form the core strategy of the ANZICS PSG for the coming years. These have been chosen to ensure ongoing growth in capacity and capability to deliver pediatric critical care research. First, to address trial costs. We are committed to pursuing digitalization of trials, including registry-embedded RCTs, from screening toward outcome capture. However, as healthcare infrastructure in ANZ remains heterogeneous in terms of electronic health records, achieving higher granularity of data (such as temporal resolution, details of treatment, and on pre- and post-ICU care) will require systems to enable reliable data extraction and linkage with ANZPICR. Second, we need to establish the infrastructure for platform and adaptive trials (38). We have successfully piloted a pediatric sepsis trial with elements of platform trial design, the Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Metabolic Resuscitation—A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study in the PICU (RESPOND PICU) (39). The study investigates early inotropes and metabolic resuscitation on overlapping populations, using a standard education package, and harmonized screening and data collection modules (8,9), and confirms the feasibility and benefit of this approach. These developments can underpin the framework to incorporate arising questions, for example, on artificial intelligence-decision support tools, in a more agile way than previously. Third, these designs will become even more relevant as we seek to develop and validate precision-medicine strategies for critically ill children. Seeking to decipher the heterogeneity of patients in terms of clinical behavior and underlying biological mechanisms (40), we have committed to biobanking in several trials which are currently undergoing multiomic analyses. This strategy places additional demands on recruiting sites, brings additional ethical challenges to families, and is reliant on additional funding and external partnerships. Finally, while ANZ has the advantage of relative homogeneity of clinical practice within a well-resourced context supported by solid research infrastructure, this setting is not generalizable to the global PICU populations and, increasingly, even such a network will not be able to power trials adequately to answer pressing questions. Thus, ANZICS PSG in recent years has sought to strengthen international partnerships. We are convinced that commitment toward a sustainable International PICU Trial Network is essential. We therefore look forward to contributing to the ongoing learning of the international PICU community as it delivers better outcomes for critically ill children and their families across the globe.
