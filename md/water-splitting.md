The application of transition metal oxides in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for generating pollution-free energy has received extensive attention; however, many challenges still hinder its commercial application. Herein, a carbon fiber paper (CFP) with high conductivity (σ = 176.72 S m–1) was prepared in our lab and used as a free-standing substrate for OER and LIB electrodes. The FeCoO nanosheets with a mesoporous structure are homogeneously anchored on the CFP by a hydrothermal method and air calcination oxidation. The nanosheet structure of FeCoO effectively mitigates the volumetric expansion of the FeCoO/CFP composite while cycling, preventing the collapse of FeCoO and ensuring the fabrication integrity of the electrode. Moreover, the high conductivity of CFP accelerates electron transport and enhances reaction kinetics. For OER, the prepared FeCoO/CFP composites achieve an overpotential of 258 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 with a long-term durability of about 50 h. For LIBs, the FeCoO/CFP composites possess a high reversible capacity of 715.2 mA h g–1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g–1. It is confirmed that the self-made CFP is a good substrate for freestanding electrodes, and the FeCoO/CFP composites show potential applications in OER electrocatalysts and LIB anode materials.

Hydrogen production from electrolyzed water has become an ideal new energy source for people to replace traditional fossil energy sources due to its high efficiency and low-carbon characteristics. Therefore, this paper presents preparation of a series of Fe/P co-doped MMoO4 (M=Co, Cu and Zn) catalyst loaded on nickel foam by simple hydrothermal and phosphorization process for the first time. After comparing different molybdate metal salts as precursors, it was demonstrated that the fabricated Fe/P co-doped CuMoO4 target catalysts possessed excellent catalytic performance with an overpotential of only 287 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm−2, faster reaction kinetics and a large active surface area for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the absorption energy of water and the electrical conductivity of the material are enhanced by the co-doping of the Fe and P. The doping of the Fe and P changes the electronic state and coordination environment of the active site, thus enhancing the catalytic activity of the electrode. The experimental results further prove that the doping of the Fe and P makes the active site more exposed and the resistance smaller, thus enhancing the conductivity and activation energy of the material. What is noteworthy is that the electrode also performed well in stability tests, which provided a fabrication solution of new catalyst for green hydrogen production.

The evolution of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a pivotal challenge in the realm of oxygen electrocatalysis. Recently, the proposition of regulating spin states has emerged as a novel avenue for enhancing the efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions. Presently, accurately modulating the metal active center into immediate spin (IS) remains a formidable challenge. Here, our research has achieved a breakthrough in precise spin state control and catalytic performance enhancement of Co3+ through the utilization of Ni-substituted LaCo1-xNixO3 perovskite. This achievement is primarily attributed to the fine regulation of both the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) and primary coordination sphere (PCS), i.e., Co6-y-[Co]-Niy (y = 0–6) and Co-O lengths, respectively. Our findings reveal that LaCo7/9Ni2/9O3 consisted of the SCS (y ≤ 2) with the eg1 fillings of IS Co3+ exhibits an optimal OER activity. Additionally, adjusting the Co-O bond length in PCS to approximately 1.89 Å proves to be more conducive to the transition of Co3+ spin states from high spin (HS) and low spin (LS) to IS. These discoveries present new approach to precisely modulating the spin state, offering promising prospects for the development of high-efficiency OER catalysts.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) two-electron water-oxidation reaction is a promising route for renewable and on-site generation of H2O2 as an alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. However, large overpotential, low product selectivity, and poor stability limit its practical applications of PEC producing H2O2. This review discusses the fundamental aspects of two-electron water oxidation toward H2O2 in a simple PEC device. It also presents the research background and all prevailing and recent breakthrough in the mechanisms of anodic H2O2 generation. Afterward, it comprehensively reviews the progress made so far in enhancing the Faradaic efficiency of H2O2 synthesis by tuning the thermodynamic energy barriers and reaction kinetics, facilitating the mass transfer of reactants and products, and stabilizing the products and catalytic surfaces. Finally, the critical challenges and opportunities for future development in this field are discussed. We believe that this review would stimulate further efforts to achieve highly efficient on-site H2O2 production and high-power-density fuel cells with H2O2 chemical utilization.

In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the selection of highly active catalysts is fundamental to curtail overpotentials and to enhance the typically sluggish kinetics characteristic of the reaction. Cobalt selenide (Co3Se4), with its optimally configured electronic structure of cobalt ions, is consistently hailed as a prospective electrocatalyst for the OER, making it highly efficient in facilitating the reaction. Despite the persistent challenges of the exposure of catalytic active sites and the limited electronic conductivity, our study unveils a breakthrough solution. We introduce a highly efficient Fe-doped Co3Se4 electrocatalyst for the OER, addressing these long-standing issues, and it has desirable compositional flexibility, formed Co3-xFexSe4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) selenides, by introducing Fe doping, the electronic structure of Co3Se4 is effectively regulated, resulting in a remarkable reduction in the overpotential of the OER under alkaline conditions. Simultaneously, the introduction of Fe induces the formation of highly active Co–O sites, ultimately establishing a highly active and stable catalytic surface for oxygen evolution. Consequently, this leads to a significant improvement in the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesized Co2.5Fe0.5Se4 catalyst exhibits lower overpotential (η10 = 220 mV) and Tafel slope (41.2 mV dec−1), which is superior to the general commercial RuO2 benchmark. In addition, Co2.5Fe0.5Se4 also exhibits exceptional structural integrity and sustained operational longevity, with a durability of up to 280 h at 100 mA cmgeo−2. Impressively, the Pt/C∥Co2.5Fe0.5Se4 water electrolysis cell only requires a battery voltage of 1.67 V to provide a current density of 100 mA cmgeo−2 and has excellent long-term stability.

Heterojunctions formed between semiconductors have been confirmed to efficiently enhance the separation of photogenerated carriers, thereby boosting the photocatalytic activity. However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterojunctions remains a challenge. In this study, g-C3N4 (CN) was positively charged by carefully adjusting the pH of the solution. Subsequently, it was precisely located on the (010) crystal facet of decahedral BiVO4 (BVO) under light irradiation, where photogenerated negative electrons accumulate on the (010) facet of BVO. This process results in the construction of a composite with a heterojunction between CN and the (010) facet of BVO. The optimal photocatalytic oxygen production activity of this composite reaches 2966.9 μmol/g/h, a remarkable 3.3 times better than that of BVO alone. This result shows that the heterojunction can significantly improve the oxygen production activity of the composite photocatalyst. By a combination of the Kubelka–Munk function, Mott–Schottky, and theoretical calculations, we found that the migration of photogenerated electrons from BVO to CN matches well with the S-scheme mechanism. This work provides valuable suggestions and guidance for the precise synthesis of heterojunction photocatalyst and is looking forward to being applied to other materials related to environmental and energy research.

Transition metal oxides (TMO), a non-noble element based oxides, establish remarkable potential in the realm of textile wastewater remediation and water splitting due to their sustainable catalytic performance. Highly functional TMO materials, in form of nanostrcutures, are of great interest owing to their robust photo and electro-catalytic activities for instituting sustainable development for the water and energy resource management framework. In the present article, we have reported catalytically active WO3 nano-pellets (NP) synthesized using microwave-assisted for photocatalytic wastewater remediation and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Promisingly, WO3 NP abetted degradation of the reactive black 5 (RB5) dye by almost 95 % in short time interval of 60 min in exposer of sun light. Present work includes the strategies to remove and observe the progression of reaction kinetics of dye degradation in neutral and alkaline media. By varying concentration of the catalyst (ranging from 250 mg/L to 1000 mg/L, in the step of 250 mg/L), we have prolifically verified that 750 mg/L turn out optimal dosage for 100% degradation in time interval of 120 min. Besides, WO3 NP has shown highest photocatalytic behaviour at 9 pH. The WO3 NP shows the electrocatalytic OER performance in an alkaline condition (1M KOH) with an overpotential of 418 mV to generate the geometric current density of 10 mA/cm² and Tafel slope of 178 mV dec⁻¹. Owing to robust nature, WO3 NP shows the almost similar photocatalytic response for ten cycles dye degradation and demonstrates the stable electrochemical charge transport for OER at 10 mA/cm2 for 50 hours.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is vital in electrocatalytic water-splitting. However, efficient non-precious metal electrocatalysts are required to improve the reaction efficiency. Therefore, this study aims to increase the OER activity of FeNi3 nanosheets using high-energy H+-ion irradiation to create multiple defects. The optimized sample (FeNi3-16) achieves a lower overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 than its pristine counterpart (FeNi3, 320 mV). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the multiple defects in Fe and Ni can synergistically reduce the d-band centres of the Fe and Ni sites, which improves the electron transfer efficiency during the OER. This ion-irradiation technique may be applied to other electrocatalysts for various energy device.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a promising technology merging the usage of intermittent renewable energy sources with the production of green hydrogen. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction remains the bottleneck of the efficiency of these devices due to sluggish reaction kinetics, high cost, and the scarcity of state-of-the-art catalytic materials. Though most research is focused on the discovery of new catalytic materials, understanding the effects of acid electrolyte anions is crucial to designing and optimizing existing electrocatalysts in diverse electrochemical microenvironments. Herein, we systematically study the effects of acid electrolytes on the IrO2(110) surface under OER reaction conditions using density functional theory. The potential-dependent anion adsorption results show that HPO42– adsorbs the strongest, followed by SO42–, NO3–, and ClO4– respectively at 1.6 V (vs RHE). HPO42– and SO42– block the Ir-active sites by competitively adsorbing with the OER intermediates while ClO4– does not interfere with OER performance. By evaluating dipole-field interactions, surface work function changes, Bader charges of adsorbed anions, and the effects of adsorbed electrolyte anions on the adsorption of the OER intermediates, we provide further insights into acid anion electrolyte effects under the OER conditions. This expansion of fundamental understanding of the effects of acid electrolyte anion adsorption on IrO2 assists in engineering better-performing catalysts with integrated electrolyte microenvironment for OER.

Due to the excellent activity and stability of MnCo2O4 toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic solution, a Pb–MnCo2O4 composite anode for zinc electrowinning was prepared by embedding dispersed MnCo2O4 particles into a Pb matrix in a powder metallurgy process. In this work, the phase structure, chemical composition, and morphology of the oxide layers formed on Pure-Pb and Pb–MnCo2O4 were analyzed by XRD, SEM, and EDS. Galvanostatic polorization, Tafel tests, and EIS measurements were performed to investigate the anodic potential variation and OER kinetics of the Pure-Pb and Pb–MnCo2O4 composite anodes. Compared with that on the Pure-Pb anode, the oxide layer on Pb–MnCo2O4 is thinner, more compact, and more stable in a 160 g L−1 H2SO4 solution containing 4 g L−1 Mn2+. Consequently, the Pb–MnCo2O4 composite anode exhibited a much lower anode slime production (8.7 mg) during 72 h of the simulated zinc electrowinning process. Despite the smaller surface area and lower PbO2 content of the oxide layer, the Pb–MnCo2O4 composite anode presented preferable OER kinetics with a lower OER charge transfer resistance (0.729 Ω cm2) and a smaller Tafel slope (90.74 mV dec−1), which contributed to a 70 mV reduction in the anodic potential compared with that of the Pure-Pb anode.

In the past few years, there has been a notable upswing in the excitement surrounding bifunctional materials, primarily due to their versatility in accommodating energy storage and conversion needs. One class of materials that garnered considerable attention is strontium ferrite nanoparticles (NPs), which are known for their remarkable electrochemical properties stemming from their exceptional physical and chemical characteristics. In this study, we have synthesized a novel, cost-effective, and highly efficient composite electrode designed for dual functionality in supercapacitor (SC) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) applications in alkaline environments. Herein, we prepared SrFe2O4@g-C3N4 composite through a coprecipitation and pyrolysis method, resulting in featuring a porous g-C3N4 matrix and strontium (Sr) spinel structure. The composite materials were thoroughly characterized using techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The SrFe2O4@g-C3N4 electrode exhibited outstanding pseudocapacitive behavior and delivered a specific capacitance of 1055 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Remarkably, it displayed a capacitance retention of 93% even after 5000 galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycles. Furthermore, in comparative assessments with bare SrFe2O4 or g-C3N4 electrodes, the SrFe2O4@g-C3N4 composite electrode displayed superior and stable electrocatalytic performance. It required minimal overpotentials (only 170 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm–2 during the OER. These results emphasize the substantial potential of Sr-based nanocomposites as auspicious materials for applications in supercapacitors and as stable electrocatalysts.

NiFe-(oxy)hydroxides are the most active transition metal oxide electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under the alkaline media. Herein, we controllably manipulated oxygen vacancy (VO)-tunable NiFe-(oxy) hydroxides that their OER performances possessed a volcano-type relationship with VO concentration, positively-correlated with Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio. Theoretical simulations further unearthed the enhanced activation and dissociation of H2O by the inserting of VO. As a result, the optimal sample featuring the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio of 30.3 % and VO of 23.8 % exhibited the overpotential of 243 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm–2, simultaneously lasting 120 h durability without any attenuation, exceding the most reported NiFe-(oxy)hydroxides. This work offers an innovative view to understand the OER performance using hypervalent Ni ratio induced by VO defects.

Iron-nitrogen-carbon single-atom catalysts derived from zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-8 (ZIF-8) have presented its great potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in Zn-air batteries (ZABs). However, due to insufficient active Fe-N sites, its ORR activity is inferior to Pt-based catalysts. Herein, a carboxylate (OAc) linker strategy is proposed to design a ZIF-8-derived FeNCOAc catalyst with abundant accessible Fe-N4 single-atom sites. Except that imidazole groups can coordinate with Fe ions, the OAc linker on the unsaturated coordination Zn nodes can anchor and coordinate with more Fe ions, resulting in a significant increase in Fe-N4 site density. Meanwhile, the corrosion of carbon skeleton by OAc oxidation during heat-treatment leads to improved porosity of catalyst. Benefitting from the highly dense Fe-N4 sites and hierarchical pores, the FeNCOAc endows superior performance in alkaline medium (E1/2 = 0.906 V), which is confirmed by density functional theory calculation results. Meanwhile, the assembled liquid ZAB delivers a favorable peak power density of 173.9 mW cm−2, and a high specific capacity of 770.9 mAh g−1 as well as outstanding durability. Besides, the solid-state ZAB also shows outstanding discharge performance.

## An Efficient Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution System with the Coupling of Polyoxometalates with Bismuth Vanadate

In this work, a coupling system consisting of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) and cobalt-based polyoxometalates (Co-POMs) was developed to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction. Crystallization-driven self-assembly and the wet chemical synthesis method were deployed in synthesizing Co-POMs and monoclinic–tetragonal mixed–phase BiVO4, respectively. The introduction of Co-POMs into a BiVO4-containing mixture significantly enhanced the water oxidation reaction, with a more than twofold increment in the total amount of oxygen evolved. For instance, 461.2 µmol of oxygen was evolved from the system containing 20 mg of Co-POMs compared to 195 µmol of oxygen produced from a pristine BiVO4 system. This extraordinary improvement in the oxygen evolution reaction indicates the existence of a positive synergic effect between BiVO4 and Co-POMs, in which Co-POMs could act as effective cocatalysts to extract photogenerated charge carriers generated by BiVO4 and improve the charge transfer process. However, the amount of oxygen produced was slightly reduced to 440.7 µmol with an increase in AgNO3 loading from 30 mg to 60 mg. This unforeseen phenomenon could be elucidated by the shielding effect of silver particles, in which a higher AgNO3 loading led to a more prominent shielding effect. The presence of silver nanoparticles on post-reaction BiVO4 was confirmed by TEM and XPS analysis. This newly established process scheme provides an insight into the development of an efficient photocatalytic oxygen evolution system in realizing future commercial applications toward green energy production.

Equimolar or nearly molar mixtures of five or more metals are used to create high-entropy oxides (HEOs). HEOs also possess the kinetic slow diffusion effect, structural lattice distortion, the thermodynamic high-entropy effect, and the cocktail effect. Consequently, a growing number of scientists are investigating high-entropy oxides. High active site density, low overpotential, and entropic stabilization effects are the main reasons why HEOs now show good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. However, the complexity of the elemental composition, organization, and surface morphology of high-entropy oxides limits the use of HEOs. The development of HEOs and the mechanisms behind OER are reviewed in this work, along with a description of the OER response pathways and evaluation standards. The OER performance of HEOs with diverse organizational structures is reviewed in this research because HEOs come in a variety of kinds. Additionally, when HEOs are utilized as carriers, the trend of OER performance is examined. Lastly, potential future development problems and opportunities for HEO electrocatalysts are discussed.

The potential of the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) to serve as a vital source of electrons for reducing water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia is an area of intense research. Among the numerous catalysts investigated for the OER, Ir compounds have emerged as particularly promising candidates. A notable highlight of this study is the concurrent OER activity of both Ir and Fe. Remarkably, Ir independently exhibits high OER activity, even at exceedingly low overpotentials, establishing its distinctiveness among other metal oxides. Under alkaline conditions, the presence of both Fe and Ir (hydr)oxides in OER systems introduces complexity, given that Fe (hydr)oxides are also known for their efficiency in the OER. This combination of elements creates a multifaceted reaction environment, where the unique properties of each component interact, influencing the overall OER process. In this study, the focus is on investigating the OER process on an Ir wire in an alkaline environment (with pH 13 and 14) in the presence of K2FeO4. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the reaction, various techniques, such as electrochemical methods, X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were employed. Following an in-depth investigation and detailed analysis of the interaction between K2FeO4 and an Ir wire, it was observed that the activity of the OER increased at overpotentials exceeding 320 mV. The observed improvement was limited to cases where Fe species had deposited on the surface of the Ir wire. The Tafel slopes were found to be 196.10 (149.20) and 102.16 (56.30) mV/decade for the Ir electrode in 0.10 M (1.0 M) KOH, in the absence and presence of K2FeO4, respectively. XAS analysis revealed the presence of the FeHyOx species on the surface of IrO2. These experiments indicate that Fe and Ir sites can independently catalyze the OER without exhibiting any synergistic interaction between them.

The study of non-precious metals to prepare catalytic materials with high performance and excellent stability is an important part of improving hydrogen production by electrolysis of water. In this work, we report on the preparation of direct composite Mo-CoFe LDH/NF as the working electrode of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using nickel foam as the substrate via one-step hydrothermal method. The direct growth in situ ensured the close contact between LDH and NF substrate, thereby reducing the charge transfer resistance and making the electrode have high electrocatalytic performance. At the current density of 10 mA·cm−2, the oxygen evolution overpotential of the Mo-CoFe LDH/NF catalytic material was 252 mV, the Tafel slope was 22.07 mV/dec, and the material could be maintained in alkaline solution for 10 hours, showing good stability. Therefore, this work proposed new ideas for the design and fabrication of low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst materials.

Molecular assemblies represent a classical type of active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while the practical application is limited by the relatively low electrical conductivity. Herein, a cobalt molecular assembly was synthesized and supported by a conductive phosphorus doped graphene. It served as a potential OER electrocatalyst by affording a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of 390 mV, and the turnover frequency of cobalt sites was increased by 21.5 times comparing to the assembly supported by the pristine graphene. Our observations unveil that the potential linking of oxidized phosphorus atoms in the carbon matrix is mainly responsible for the high activity of cobalt molecular assembly. The overall OER catalytic cycle was analyzed by in situ attenuated total reflectance-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, suggesting that the formation of *OOH species on the cobalt sites could be critical for the final evolution of oxygen. These results open a potential avenue into the exploration of highly active OER electrocatalysts toward replacing the noble metals based electrocatalysts.

Effective, sturdy and cheap electrocatalysts are extremely desirable for water electrolysis. In this work, transition metal molybdates (MMoO4, M = Fe, Co, Ni) with extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in basic electrolyte solution was reported. β-Fe2(MoO4)3 catalyst exhibits better electrocatalytic performance and robustness for both HER and OER compared to NiMoO4 and CoMoO4. Theoretical study (DFT calculation) disclose that the Fe atoms increase the energy states near the Fermi level in β-Fe2(MoO4)3 which makes it more conductive leading to superior OER and HER activity. Compared to CoMoO4 and NiMoO4, β-Fe2(MoO4)3 have well defined multiple Mo 4d orbitals at the conduction band. These are empty states in conduction band, ready to receive the electrons. Further, the computed overpotential values for NiMoO4, CoMoO4, and β-Fe2(MoO4)3 surfaces follow the trend, β-Fe2(MoO4)3 < NiMoO4 < CoMoO4, corroborating with the experimental results.

Abstract The reconstructed surface structure of Co‐based spinel oxides serves as the active site for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the structural complexity of spinel oxides and surface dynamics during the OER hinder the understanding of the reconstruction mechanism and electronic structure of the active site. In this study, spinel Co 3 O 4 @(CoFeV) 3 O 4 nanocube (CoFeV) is reported, a (001) facet‐defined spinel oxide comprising Co, Fe, and V deposited on the Co 3 O 4 nanocube template to exclude facet‐dependent factors. Introducing highly dissoluble V cations accelerates the reconstruction process to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. CoFeV exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity (266 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in 1 M KOH) and durability (maintained stable electrocatalytic activity during a 200 h chronopotentiometry (CP) test at 100 mA cm −2 ) with significantly enlarged electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that V dissolution during catalysis induced oxygen vacancies, accelerating the surface reconstruction to highly active oxyhydroxide. Consequently, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) of CoFeV as the anode exhibited a remarkable performance of 6.19 A cm −2 at 2.0 V cell in 1 M KOH and robust durability for 96 h at a constant current density of 500 mA cm −2 .

High entropy compounds were proven to exhibit excellent catalytic activity. Here, a series of amorphous CrMnFeCoNi Oxy-carbide films were successfully synthesized by one-step electrodeposition. As demonstrated, the film presented superior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. Uniquely, selective dissolution of Chromium (Cr) was observed, which increased the catalytic activity and showed high stability under a large current density of up to 400 mA/cm2. Cr dissolution not only increased the surface area but also improved the conductivity due to newly formed metal-metal bonding, promoting electron transfer and improving OER performance. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Cr-dissolution mediates the bonding of OER intermediates over surface active sites and ultimately reduces OER overpotential. The one-step electrodeposition method and the micro-dissolution mechanism provided a potential way to design and prepare high entropy compound electrodes, aiming to achieve efficient water electrolysis.

Metal–cation doping is a fundamental strategy for enhancing catalyst performance. Fe-doped Ni0.85Se/NF (Fe-Ni0.85Se/NF) nanoparticles were prepared at 80°C via Fe2+ etching method. The addition of Fe altered the coordination environment of the Ni species along with the catalyst's morphology, creating additional active sites. Notably, the synergistic interaction between the bimetallic components augmented the built-in activity and accelerated reaction kinetics. The Fe-Ni0.85Se/NF electrocatalysts demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an acceptable overpotential of 276 mV and a Tafel slope of 58.1 mV dec−1 at 100 mA cm−2. Moreover, they demonstrated exceptional durability. In situ Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses showed that the excellent OER performance stemmed from the reconstruction-induced hydroxyl oxide. This study offers a novel approach for streamlining the synthesis procedures and reducing the experimental costs for developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts.
