Abstract The design of electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a limitation of industrial hydrogen production by electrolysis of water. Excellent and stable OER catalysts can be developed by activating lattice oxygen and changing the reaction path. Herein, S and FeOOH on the Co(OH) 2 nanoneedle arrays are introduced to construct a heterostructure (S‐FeOOH/Co(OH) 2 /NF) as a proof of concept. Theoretical calculations and experimental suggest that the Co‐O‐Fe motif formed at the heterogeneous interface with the introduction of FeOOH, inducing electron transfer from Co to Fe, enhancing Co─O covalency and reducing intramolecular charge transfer energy, thereby stimulating direct intramolecular lattice oxygen coupling. Doping of S in FeOOH further accelerates electron transfer, improves lattice oxygen activity, and prevents dissolution of FeOOH. Consequently, the overpotential of S‐FeOOH/Co(OH) 2 /NF is only 199 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , and coupled with the Pt/C electrode can be up to 1 A cm −2 under 1.79 V and remain stable for over 120 h in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This work proposes a strategy for the design of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for industrial water electrolysis and promotes the commercialization of AEMWE.

Abstract In alkaline water electrolysis and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis technologies, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode is significantly constrained by a high energy barrier during the water dissociation step. This study employs a phase engineering strategy to construct heterostructures composed of crystalline Ni 4 W and amorphous WO x aiming to enhance catalytic performance in the HER under alkaline conditions. This work systematically modulates the oxidation states of W within the amorphous WO x of the heterostructure to adjust the electronic states of the phase boundary, the energy barriers associated with the water dissociation step, and the adsorption/desorption properties of intermediates during the alkaline HER process. The optimized catalyst, Ni 4 W/WO x ‐2, with a quasi‐metallic state of W coordinated by a low oxygen content in amorphous WO x , demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance (22 mV@10 mA cm −2 ), outperforming commercial Pt/C (30 mV@10 mA cm −2 ). Furthermore, the operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the optimized W atoms in amorphous WO x serve as active sites for water dissociation and the nearby Ni atoms in crystalline Ni 4 W facilitated the release of H 2 . These findings provide valuable insights into designing efficient heterostructured materials for energy conversion.

CoFe-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are emerging as prominent candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their tunable 3d orbital electronic structure but are still restricted by the strong adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates due to their high antibonding orbital relative to the Fermi level. Herein, we synthesized Ga-doped CoFe LDH (GaCoFe LDH) as a highly effective catalyst for alkaline OER. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the strong p–d orbital hybridization between Ga and Co/Fe atoms plays a critical role in boosting the OER performance. This hybridization not only effectively reduces the antibonding orbital energy levels due to an enhanced electronic filling degree in the antibonding orbital but also facilitates the dehydrogenation of *OH to *O, thereby boosting catalytic activity. Remarkably, GaCoFe LDH exhibits excellent OER performance, surpassing both CoFe LDH and RuO2/NF, with low overpotentials of 185 and 242 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm–2, respectively, while maintaining exceptional OER stability.

Hydrogen generation via photoelectrochemical (PEC) overall water splitting is an attractive means of renewable energy production so developing and designing the cost-effective and high-activity bifunctional PEC catalysts both for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been focused on. Based on first-principles calculations, we propose a feasible strategy to enhance either HER or OER performance in the monoclinic exposed BiVO4 (110) facet by the introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ovacs). Our results show that oxygen vacancies induce charge rearrangements, which enhances charge transfer between active sites and adatoms. Furthermore, the incorporation of oxygen vacancies reduces the work function of the system, which makes charge transfer from the inner to the surface more easily; thus, the charges possess stronger redox capacity. As a result, the Ovac reduces both the hydrogen adsorption-free energy (ΔGH*) for the HER and the overpotential for the OER, facilitating the PEC activity of overall water splitting. The findings provide not only a method to develop bifunctional PEC catalysts based on BiVO4 but also insight into the mechanism of enhanced catalytic performance.

The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key resistance limiting the efficiency of related technologies. CoFe-based compounds, mainly alloys and oxides, are recognized as effective OER catalysts, with amorphous metal oxides displaying unique properties. The catalytic activity of a catalyst is intricately linked to its surface reactivity. However, efforts to construct composites with interfaces between CoFe-based metal alloys and amorphous metal oxides to further enhance the OER activities have progressed relatively slowly. In this work, a composite catalyst, denoted Ag/CoFe/Fe2O3/NC, was fabricated by incorporating Ag into crystalline CoFe@amorphous Fe2O3 particles wrapped in graphitic N-doped carbon. The composite exhibited modulated electron density of Co active sites, promoted O2 release, and an enhanced electron transfer rate on the heterogeneous interface between crystalline CoFe and amorphous Fe2O3. Additionally, the introduction of highly conductive Ag improved the electrical conductivity. Consequently, the composite demonstrated excellent performance and stability for OER in 1 M KOH. Notably, the catalyst exhibited competitive performance, requiring overpotentials of only 166 and 282 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm–2, respectively. This places the catalyst among the most efficient, as far as we know. This work provides an excellent example of the rational design of electrocatalysts.

The chemical coupling of molybdenum carbide (Mo 2 C) to cobalt (Co) promotes oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics on the Co surface by making the surface more electrophilic. Here, to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of the surface electrophilic properties on the OER kinetics of Co and to obtain high OER activity, Fe and Ni are additionally incorporated into Co nanoparticles that are coupled with Mo 2 C nanoparticles (Co‐Mo 2 C). Considering the oxidation states of Fe (Fe 3+ ), Co (Co 2+ /Co 3+ ), and Ni (Ni 2+ ) ions, Fe and Ni are expected to affect the electronic structure of Co in the opposite direction. Lewis acidic Fe 3+ doping makes the Co surface oxide more electrophilic, promoting the formation of OER‐active CoOOH by strongly attracting hydroxide ions (OH − ). Thus, the OER kinetics is facilitated on the Co surface of Fe‐doped Co‐Mo 2 C, resulting in a significantly lower overpotential for the OER. On the other hand, the Ni 2+ doping makes the Co surface oxide less electrophilic, leading to an increase in the overpotential for the OER. Tailoring the electrophilic properties of the Co surface is presented as a key parameter in the design of a Co‐based OER catalyst for alkaline water electrolysis.

Abstract The development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to meet the practical demand for water splitting. In this study, an effective approach is proposed that simultaneously enhances interfacial interaction and catalytic activity by modifying Fe 2 O 3 /CoS heterojunction using Ru doping strategy to construct an efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution catalyst. The unique morphology of Ru doped Fe 2 O 3 (Ru‐Fe 2 O 3 ) nanoring decorated by CoS nanoparticles ensures a large active surface area and a high number of active sites. The designed Ru‐Fe 2 O 3 /CoS catalyst achieves a low OER overpotential (264 mV) at 10 mA cm −2 and demonstrates exceptional stability even at high current density of 100 mA cm −2 , maintaining its performance for an impressive duration of 90 h. The catalytic performance of this Ru‐Fe 2 O 3 /CoS catalyst surpasses that of other iron‐based oxide catalysts and even outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art RuO 2 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculation as well as experimental in situ characterization confirm that the introduction of Ru atoms can enhance the interfacial electron interaction, accelerating the electron transfer, and serve as highly active sites reducing the energy barrier for rate determination step.

Abstract Future energy loss can be minimized to a greater extent via developing highly active electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolyzers. Incorporating an innovative design like high entropy oxides, dealloying, structural reconstruction, in situ activation can potentially reduce the energy barriers between practical and theoretical potentials. Here, a Fd‐3m spinel group high entropy oxide is developed via a simple solvothermal and calcination approach. The developed (FeCoMnZnMg) 3 O 4 electrocatalyst shows a near equimolar distribution of all the metal elements resulting in higher entropy (ΔS ≈1.61R) and higher surface area. The self‐reconstructed spinel high entropy oxide (S‐HEO) catalyst exhibited a lower overpotential of 240 mV to reach 10 mA cm −2 and enhanced reaction kinetics (59 mV dec −1 ). Noticeably, the S‐HEO displayed an outstanding durability of 1000 h without any potential loss, significantly outperforming most of the reported OER electrocatalysts. Further, S‐HEO is evaluated as the anode catalyst for an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) in 1 m , 0.1 m KOH, and DI water at 20 and 60 °C. These results demonstrate that S‐HEO is a highly attractive, non‐noble class of materials for high active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts allowing fine‐tuning beyond the limits of bi‐ or trimetallic oxides.

Abstract The concept of photoelectrochemical conversion of biomass into industrially valuable chemicals presents a compelling strategy to supplant the lower‐value oxygen evolution typically associated with photoanodes. Here, a surface potential manipulation method by regulating the surface oxygen valence states is put forward, which is demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the selective photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone (DHA). This involves the concurrent establishment of a BiVO 4 /CoO x heterojunction and a BiVO 4 /Au Schottky junction, aiming to fine‐tune the BiVO 4 photoanode's surface potential and improve both its charge carrier separation and interfacial transfer kinetics. The BiVO 4 /CoO x /Au photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 6.15 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Meanwhile, selective glycerol oxidation efficiency achieves a DHA evolution rate of 339.74 mmol m −2 h −1 and a selectivity exceeding 60%. Experiments and theoretical analysis underscore the pivotal role played by the surface potential in mediating glycerol and DHA adsorption and desorption processes. Additionally, the diminished surface potential attributed to the CoO x and Au amendments is responsible for the decreased Gibbs free energy of the dehydrogenation's rate‐limiting step involving the intermediate carbon species. This work demonstrates a method to design glycerol oxidation catalysts by modulating the interfacial molecular adsorption/desorption by surface potential regulation.

Abstract Developing high‐efficiency durable electrocatalysts in wide pH range for water splitting is significant for environmentally‐friendly synthesis of renewable hydrogen energy. Herein, a facile method by dealloying designable multicomponent metallic glass precursors is reported to synthesize amorphous‐crystalline heterostructured nanoporous high‐entropy alloys (AC‐HEAs) of CuAgAuPtPd, CuAgAuIrRu, and CuAgAuPtPdIrRu, heaped up by nanocrystalline particles with an average size of 2‐3 nm and the amorphous glued phase. The synthesized AC‐HEA‐CuAgAuPtPd owns highly catalytic performances for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with 9.5 and 20 mV to reach 10 mA·cm −2 in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 and 1.0 m KOH, and AC‐HEA‐CuAgAuIrRu delivers 208 and 200 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, a two‐electrode electrolyzer made of the AC‐HEA‐CuAgAuIrRu bifunctional electrodes exhibit a low cell voltage of 1.48 and 1.49 V in the acidic and alkaline conditions at 10 mA·cm −2 for overall water splitting. Combining the enhanced catalytic activities from nanoscale amorphous structure and atom‐level synergistic catalyst in AC‐HEAs provides an effective pathway for pH‐universal electrocatalysts of water splitting.

The influence of anodic potentiostatic treatment of nickel surface in deep eutectic solvents, ethaline and reline (eutectic mixtures of choline chloride with ethylene glycol and urea, respectively), on the electrocatalytic activity in the electrochemical reactions of oxygen evolution and urea oxidation in an aqueous alkaline medium (1 M NaOH) was investigated for the first time. It was shown that, depending on the chosen treatment potential and the nature of the eutectic solvent used, a significant increase in the rate of the studied processes was observed. Specifically, after anodic treatment of nickel under certain conditions, the polarization of the oxygen evolution reaction at a current density of 0.1 A/cm2 could be reduced by approximately 150–200 mV, and the maximum current density of urea oxidation could be increased by an order of magnitude (from 0.012 A/cm2 to 0.131 A/cm2 at a urea concentration of 0.33 mol/dm3 in alkaline solution). The observed increase in electrocatalytic activity after anodic treatment of nickel in deep eutectic solvents is likely related to changes in surface morphology patterns and the nature and concentration of relevant electroactive sites on the electrode surface. The results obtained in this work can be used for the development of highly efficient electrode materials for green hydrogen energy.

Abstract Ruthenium dioxide (RuO₂) electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffer from mediocre activity and rather instability induced by high Ru-O covalency. Here, the tensile strained Sr0.1Ta0.1Ru0.8O2-x (TS-Sr0.1Ta0.1Ru0.8O2-x) nanocatalysts were synthesized via a molten salt-assisted quenching strategy. The TS spacially elongates the Ru-O bond and reduces covalency, thereby inhibiting the lattice oxygen participation and structural decomposition. The synergistic electronic modulations among Sr-Ru-Ta groups both optimize deprotonation on oxygen sites and intermediates absorption on Ru sites, lowering the OER energy barrier. Those result in a well-balanced activity-stability profile, confirmed by comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses. Our TS-Sr0.1Ta0.1Ru0.8O2-x electrode demonstrated an overpotential of 166 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and an order of magnitude higher S-number, indicating exceptional stability compared to bare Sr0.1Ta0.1Ru0.8O2-x. It exhibited degradation rates of 0.02 mV/h at 10 mA cm-2 over 1000 h and 0.25 mV/h at 200 mA cm-2 over 200 h. This study elucidates the effectiveness of tensile strain and strategic doping in enhancing the activity and stability of Ru-based catalysts for acidic OER.

Abstract Anionic redox allows the direct formation of O─O bonds from lattice oxygens and provides higher catalytic in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than does the conventional metal ion mechanism. While previous theories have predicted and experiments have suggested the possible O─O bond, it has not yet been directly observed in the OER process. In this study, operando soft X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) at the O K‐edge and the operando Raman spectra is performed on layered double CoFe hydroxides (LDHs) after intercalation with [Cr(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3− , and revealed a three‐step oxidation process, staring from Co 2+ to Co 3+ , further to Co 4+ (3d6L), and ultimately leading to the formation of O─O bonds and O 2 evolution above a threshold voltage (1.4 V). In contrast, a gradual oxidation of Fe is observed in CoFe LDHs. The OER activity exhibits a significant enhancement, with the overpotential decreasing from 300 to 248 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , following the intercalation of [Cr(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3− into CoFe LDHs, underscoring a crucial role of anionic redox in facilitating water splitting.

Understanding the influence of surface structural features at a molecular level is beneficial in guiding an electrode's mechanistic proposals for electrocatalytic reactions. The relationship between structural stability and catalytic activity significantly impacts reaction performance, even though atomistic knowledge of active sites remains a topic of discussion. In this context, this work presents scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results for the highly ordered arrangement of manganese porphyrin molecules on a Au(111) surface; STM allows us to monitor active sites at a molecular level to focus on long-standing issues with the electrocatalytic process, especially the exact nature of the real active sites at the interfaces. After water oxidation, manganese porphyrin rapidly decomposes into active catalytic species as bright protrusions. These newly formed active species drastically lost catalytic activity, up to 82%, through only acid treatment, one of the oxide removal methods, not by deionized water and acetone treatments. STM results of the obviated active species on the Au surface by an acidic solution support the forfeited catalytic activity. In addition, it shows a 67% decrement in catalytic activity by adsorption of phosphonic acid, one of the oxide's preferred adsorption materials, compared to the pristine one. Based on these observations, we confirm that the newly formed active species, as water oxidation catalysts, mostly consist of manganese oxides. Notable findings of our work provide molecular evidence for the active sites of Au and modified Au electrodes that spur the future development of water oxidation catalysts.

Transition metal oxides, particularly NiFe(OH)2, are recognized for their high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and structural stability. However, their performance in natural seawater electrolysis remains insufficiently studied. Manganese dioxide (MnO2), which is known for its multiple crystal phases and high OER selectivity, can be incorporated to enhance the catalytic properties. In this study, the OER catalytic performance of carbon cloth-supported manganese dioxide-modified nickel–iron bimetallic hydroxide (MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC) electrodes was explored in both alkaline and natural seawater. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode achieved overpotentials of 284 mV and 363 mV at current densities of 10 mA·cm−2 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively, with a Tafel slope of 68.6 mV·dec−1 in alkaline seawater. Most importantly, the prepared MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode maintained stable OER performance over 120 h of testing. In natural seawater, the MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode outperformed the NiFe-LDH/CC electrode by exhibiting an oxygen evolution selectivity of 61.1%. This study highlights the potential of MnO2-modified nickel–iron-based materials for efficient and stable OER in seawater electrolysis, which offers a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production in coastal desert regions.

A comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes at the catalyst/electrolyte interfaces is crucial for the development of advanced electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the chemical processes related to surface corrosion and catalyst degradation have not been well understood so far. In this study, we employ LiCoO 2 as a model catalyst and observe distinct OER activities and surface stabilities in different alkaline solutions. Operando X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and online mass spectroscopy (OMS) measurements prove the selective intercalation of alkali cations into the layered structure of LiCoO 2 during OER. It is proposed that the dynamic cation intercalations facilitate the chemical oxidation process between highly oxidative Co species and adsorbed water molecules, triggering the so‐called electrochemical‐chemical reaction mechanism (EC‐mechanism). The results of this study emphasize the influence of cations on OER and provide insights into new strategies for achieving both high activity and stability in high‐performance OER catalysts.

Abstract Oxygen redox in layered oxide cathodes for Na‐ion batteries is considered a promising approach for improving the energy density. However, oxygen‐redox‐based cathodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and undesirable structural change during charge/discharge, leading to poor electrochemical performances. Herein, introducing vacancies (□) in the transition metal layers enables the enhanced oxygen redox‐based electrochemical performances in the P3‐type Mn‐based layered oxide cathode is demonstrated. The vacancies can play a role of the local distortion buffers, resulting in the enhanced oxygen redox kinetics and the suppressed structural deformation such as P3‐O3(II) phase transition. The oxygen‐redox‐based P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 exhibits the large discharge capacity of ≈140.95 mAh g −1 at 26 mA g −1 with a high average discharge voltage of ≈3.54 V (vs Na + /Na). Even at 650 mA g −1 , its discharge capacity and average operation voltages delivered ≈122.06 mAh g −1 and ≈3.22 V, respectively. Especially, the small gap of average discharge voltage indicates both improves power‐capability and enhanced kinetics of oxygen redox in P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 . Moreover, the vacancy buffer in the transition metal layers results in the stable cycle‐performance of P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 with the capacity retention of ≈80.80% for 100 cycles, due to the suppressed P3‐O3(II) phase transition.

Abstract Surface reconstruction plays a pivotal role in enhancing the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in terms of the structural transformation from metal oxides to (oxy)hydroxides. Herein, a novel (oxy)hydroxide (FeCoNiCuMoOOH) with high entropy is developed by the electrochemical reconstitution of corresponding oxide (FeCoNiCuMoO x ). Significantly, the FeCoNiCuMoOOH exhibits much higher OER electrocatalytic activity and durability with an overpotential as low as 201 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and with a Tafel slope of 39.4 mV dec −1 . The FeCoNiCuMoOOH/NF presents high stability when testing under a constant current at 100 mA cm −2 within 1000 h. The surface reconstruction is a process of dissolution‐reprecipitation of Cu and Mo species and co‐hydroxylation of five metal species, which ultimately leads to the formation of FeCoNiCuMoOOH from FeCoNiCuMoOx. This study holds great significance in the realm of designing high‐entropy (oxy)hydroxides catalysts with exceptional activity and stability for OER.

Abstract Multinuclear metal clusters are ideal candidates to catalyze small molecule activation reactions involving the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, on constructing an unparalleled Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster within porphyrin‐based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and the electrocatalytic features of such Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is reported. The reaction of Co II sulfate and metal complexes of tetrakis(4‐pyridyl)porphyrin under solvothermal conditions afforded Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs (M═Co, Cu, and Zn). Crystallographic studies revealed that these Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs have the same framework structure, having the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters connected by metalloporphyrin units through Co─N pyridyl bonds. In the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster, the four Co II ions are chemically and symmetrically equivalent and are each coordinated with four sulfate O atoms to give a distorted cube‐like structure. Electrocatalytic studies showed that these Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs are all active for electrocatalytic OER and ORR. Importantly, by regulating the activity of the metalloporphyrin units, it is confirmed that the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster is active for oxygen electrocatalysis. With the use of Co porphyrins as connecting units, Co 4 ‐Co‐MOF displays the highest electrocatalytic activity in this series of MOFs by showing a 10 mA cm −2 OER current density at 357 mV overpotential and an ORR half‐wave potential at 0.83 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of two proximal Co atoms in the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster in OER by facilitating the formation of O─O bonds. This work is of fundamental significance to present the construction of Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters in framework structures for oxygen electrocatalysis and to demonstrate the cooperation between two proximal Co atoms in such clusters during the O─O bond formation process.

Abstract The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) from O 2 or H 2 O via the two‐electron (2e − ) oxygen reduction (2e − ORR) or water oxidation (2e − WOR) reaction provides a green and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, a paired‐electrosynthesis tactic is reported for concerted H 2 O 2 production at a high rate by coupling the 2e − ORR and 2e − WOR, in which the bifunctional oxygen‐vacancy‐enriched Bi 2 O 3 nanorods (O v ‐Bi 2 O 3 ‐EO), obtained through electrochemically oxidative reconstruction of Bi‐based metal–organic framework (Bi‐MOF) nanorod precursor, are used as both efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, achieving concurrent H 2 O 2 production at both electrodes with high Faradaic efficiencies. Specifically, the coupled 2e − ORR//2e − WOR electrolysis system based on such distinctive oxygen‐defect Bi catalyst displays excellent performance for the paired‐electrosynthesis of H 2 O 2 , delivering a remarkable cell Faradaic efficiency of 154.8% and an ultrahigh H 2 O 2 production rate of 4.3 mmol h −1 cm −2 . Experiments combined with theoretical analysis reveal the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in optimizing the adsorption of intermediates associated with the selective two‐electron reaction pathways, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of the 2e − reaction processes at both electrodes. This work establishes a new paradigm for developing advanced electrocatalysts and designing novel paired‐electrolysis systems for scalable and sustainable H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis.

Structural metamorphosis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) eliciting highly active metal-hydroxide catalysts has come to the fore lately, with much promise. However, the role of organic ligands leaching into electrolytes during alkaline hydrolysis remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the influence of organic carboxylate anions on a family of Ni or NiFe-based hydroxide type catalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction. After excluding interfering variables, i.e., electrolyte purity, Ohmic loss, and electrolyte pH, the experimental results indicate that adding organic anions to the electrolyte profoundly impacts the redox potential of the Ni species versus with only a negligible effect on the oxygen evolution activities. In-depth studies demonstrate plausible reasons behind those observations and allude to far-reaching implications in controlling electrocatalysis in MOFs, mainly where compositional modularity entails fine-tuning organic anions.

Abstract N-doped carbon materials, with their applications as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), have been extensively studied. However, a negletcted fact is that the operating potential of the ORR is higher than the theoretical oxidation potential of carbon, possibly leading to the oxidation of carbon materials. Consequently, the influence of the structural oxidation evolution on ORR performance and the real active sites are not clear. In this study, we discover a two-step oxidation process of N-doped carbon during the ORR. The first oxidation process is caused by the applied potential and bubbling oxygen during the ORR, leading to the oxidative dissolution of N and the formation of abundant oxygen-containing functional groups. This oxidation process also converts the reaction path from the four-electron (4e) ORR to the two-electron (2e) ORR. Subsequently, the enhanced 2e ORR generates oxidative H 2 O 2 , which initiates the second stage of oxidation to some newly formed oxygen-containing functional groups, such as quinones to dicarboxyls, further diversifying the oxygen-containing functional groups and making carboxyl groups as the dominant species. We also reveal the synergistic effect of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups by providing additional opportunities to access active sites with optimized adsorption of OOH*, thus leading to high efficiency and durability in electrocatalytic H 2 O 2 production.

Drawing inspiration from the structure of a starfish, we constructed a starfish-tentacle-like CoP/Co2Fe1P/CC heterostructure on a carbon cloth substrate using ZIF as the precursor. This design aimed to enhance the boundary electron transfer capability, providing more interface active sites and thereby accelerating proton transfer and transport. As anticipated, the CoP/Co2Fe1P/CC catalyst exhibited exceptional performance in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. It required only a 73 mV overpotential for hydrogen evolution and 253 mV overpotential for oxygen evolution at a current density of 10 mA cm–2. Notably, it achieved a low voltage of 1.49 V for sustained overall water splitting, surpassing most state-of-the-art transition metal phosphide-based catalysts.

In light of the intensifying global energy crisis and the mounting demand for environmental protection, it is of vital importance to develop advanced hydrogen energy conversion systems. Electrolysis cells for hydrogen production and fuel cell devices for hydrogen utilization are indispensable in hydrogen energy conversion. As one of the electrolysis cells, water splitting involves two electrochemical reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. And oxygen reduction reaction coupled with hydrogen oxidation reaction, represent the core electrocatalytic reactions in fuel cell devices. However, the inherent complexity and the lack of a clear understanding of the structure-performance relationship of these electrocatalytic reactions, have posed significant challenges to the advancement of research in this field. In this work, the recent development in revealing the mechanism of electrocatalytic reactions in hydrogen energy conversion systems is reviewed, including in situ characterization and theoretical calculation. First, the working principles and applications of operando measurements in unveiling the reaction mechanism are systematically introduced. Then the application of theoretical calculations in the design of catalysts and the investigation of the reaction mechanism are discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities are also summarized and discussed for paving the development of hydrogen energy conversion systems.

Electrochemical water splitting is a viable solution for producing clean energy sources. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and high overpotential restrict their further application in large-scale hydrogen generation. In this work, we prepared NiFeP catalysts by a hydrothermal reaction and phosphorization treatment and studied the effect of the reaction temperature on the morphology and properties of the samples. The prepared NiFeP-140 samples possess a specific surface area of 25.13 m2g−1, which provides many active sites for the electrochemical reaction. They show an overpotential of 93 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 233 mV @ 50 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Also, the samples show Tafel slopes of 79.24 mV dec−1 (HER) and 80.73 mV dec−1 (OER). This facile strategy can be extended to prepare other transition-metal electrocatalysts.

Abstract Crystalline perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, particularly for anodic oxygen evolution reactions, owing to their low cost and high intrinsic activity. Perovskite oxides with noncrystalline or amorphous characteristics also exhibit promising electrocatalytic performance toward electrochemical water splitting. In this review, a fundamental understanding of the characteristics and advantages of crystalline, noncrystalline, and amorphous perovskite oxides is presented. Subsequently, recent progress in the development of advanced electrocatalysts for water electrolysis by engineering and breaking the crystallinity of perovskite oxides is reviewed, with a special focus on the underlying structure–activity relationships. Finally, the remaining challenges and unsolved issues are presented, and an outlook is briefly proposed for the future exploration of next‐generation water‐splitting electrocatalysts based on perovskite oxides.

Abstract Developing effective descriptors for perovskite oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing clean energy technologies, which are often constrained by incomplete theoretical calculations. Herein, using step‐wise strained (−3–3%) NdNiO 3 as a model, the density functional theory (DFT) is employed, considering both bulk superlattice model (B‐model) and surface slab models (S‐model) to garner a set of electronic descriptors. The S‐model‐derived metal─oxygen orbital hybridization is found to agree with the X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results, which, however, are disentangled from the observed OER activity trend. Further detailed analysis discovers that the alignment of the calculated O 2p band position with the OER redox potential on an absolute scale can serve as a hitherto unexplored descriptor for comprehending the activity of lattice oxygen and its bonding strength to OH * . Combined DFT and XAS data reveals that excessive strain hinders surface oxygen exchange, slows down the rate‐determining step of OH * adsorption, and impairs the durability of the electrocatalyst by altering the random electron occupancy in frontier orbitals. The work sheds light on the rational design of cost‐effective, high‐performance perovskite‐based electrocatalysts.

Manganese oxide is a unique type of transition metal oxide that effectively functions as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, manganese oxide (MnOx) polymorphs are synthesized through electrochemical deposition and treated with an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). The APPJ surface treatment can generate numerous oxygen vacancies and modify the crystallinity of the MnOx films, which can enhance the long‐term stability of the MnOx films by stabilizing the Mn3+ content in the highly oxidizing environment. The increase in Mn3+ content and concentration of oxygen vacancies in the material synergistically increase the adsorption capacity of OH* and the electron‐transferring capacity of MnOx films in the OER process, making them more stable and effective for OER. MnOx films treated with APPJ exhibit significantly higher activity, better stability, and lower Tafel slopes for OER than untreated MnOx films. The MnOx films treated with APPJ can remain stable for up to 92 hours during OER with a current density of 10 mA cm‐2, with an onset overpotential of 310 mV. This strategy, which combines APPJ surface treatment techniques with electrodeposition methods, is innovative in the surface modification of manganese oxides with mixed valences to create OER catalysts with stable Mn3+ content.

Abstract Tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on intratumoral free radicals, while the limited oxygen source and the depletion of tissue oxygen may exacerbate the hypoxia. As the treatment progresses, there will eventually be a problem of insufficient free radicals. Here, it is found that Au@CeO 2 nano‐rods (Au@Ce NRs), assembled by gold nano‐rods (Au NRs) and ceria nanoparticles (CeO 2 NPs), can efficaciously absorb near‐infrared light (NIR) to promote the release of oxygen and free radicals. Au@Ce NRs exhibit a higher proportion of Ce 3+ (Ce 2 O 3 ) after oxygen release, while Ce 3+ is subsequently oxidized to Ce 4+ (CeO 2 ) by trace H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, Au@Ce NRs re‐oxidized by trace H 2 O 2 can re‐releasing oxygen and free radicals again upon NIR treatment, achieving oxygenation/oxygen evolution, similar to charging/discharging. This loop maximizes the conversion of limited oxygen source into highly cytotoxic free radicals. As a result, when B16‐F10 cells are treated by NIR/Au@Ce NRs, more tumor cells undergo apoptosis, consistent with the higher level of free radicals. Importantly, NIR/Au@Ce NRs successfully suppresses tumor growth and promotes the generation of epidermal collagen fibers in the transplanted tumor model. Therefore, the rod‐shaped Au@Ce NRs provide an ideal platform for maximizing the utilization of intratumoral oxygen sources and improving the treatment of melanoma.

To address issues of global energy sustainability, it is essential to develop highly efficient bifunctional transition metal-based electrocatalysts to accelerate the kinetics of both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, the heterogeneous molybdenum and vanadium codoped cobalt carbonate nanosheets loaded on nickel foam (VMoCoCOx@NF) are fabricated by facile hydrothermal deposition. Firstly, the mole ratio of V/Mo/Co in the composite is optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). When the optimized composite serves as a bifunctional catalyst, the water-splitting current density achieves 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 at cell voltages of 1.54 V and 1.61 V in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with robust stability. Furthermore, characterization is carried out using field emission scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (FESEM-EDS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the fabricated VMoCoCOx@NF catalyst synergistically decreases the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates, thus accelerating OER/HER catalytic kinetics. Benefiting from the concerted advantages of porous NF substrates and clustered VMoCoCOx nanosheets, the fabricated catalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance. This work presents a novel approach to developing transition metal catalysts for overall water splitting.

Photo-biocatalysts are one of nature's finest in transmuting inorganic carbon into complex organic molecules using solar energy through the photosynthetic machinery. Photosynthesis has been the governing factor for global sustenance, keeping the detrimental fluctuations caused by natural and man-made activities at bay. The photo-biocatalysts cluster encompasses microalgae, cyanobacteria, photobacteria, and plants, each of which is uniquely equipped with the potential to produce essential biocommodities and sequester CO2. The numerous applications of photo-biocatalysts include oxygen evolution, the foremost reason for life's existence, provide valuable resources to derive medicinal, edible, and biobased products, etc. Current photosynthetic research is rapidly progressing towards understanding the molecular mechanics, enhancing the light harvestation efficiency, and renewable energy production. This chapter elaborates on the carbon assimilation mechanism, the diverse range of products synthesized, and the versatility of the photo-biocatalysts to integrate with other bioprocesses which effectively collate into a biorefinery and further lead to a green bioeconomy.

This study first demonstrates the potential of organic photoabsorbing blends in overcoming a critical limitation of metal oxide photoanodes in tandem modules: insufficient photogenerated current. Various organic blends, including PTB7‐Th:FOIC, PTB7‐Th:O6T‐4F, PM6:Y6, and PM6:FM, were systematically tested. When coupled with electron transport layer (ETL) contacts, these blends exhibit exceptional charge separation and extraction, with PM6:Y6 achieving saturation photocurrents up to 16.8 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V RHE (oxygen evolution thermodynamic potential). For the first time, a tandem structure utilizing organic photoanodes has been computationally designed and fabricated and the implementation of a double PM6:Y6 photoanode/photovoltaic structure resulted in photogenerated currents exceeding 7 mA cm −2 at 0 V RHE (hydrogen evolution thermodynamic potential) and anodic current onset potentials as low as −0.5 V RHE . The herein‐presented organic‐based approach paves the way for further exploration of different blend combinations to target specific oxidative reactions by selecting precise donor/acceptor candidates among the multiple existing ones.

Abstract Lithium-air batteries (LABs) are gaining attention as a promising energy storage solution. Their theoretical energy density of 3,505 Whkg-1 exceeds that of conventional lithium-ion batteries (500–800 Whkg-1). The commercial viability and widespread adoption of lithium-air batteries face challenges such as poor cycling stability, limited lifespan, and unresolved side reactions. In this study, we synthesized spinel CoFe2O4-decorated on bio-based poly(2,5-benzimidazole) derived N-doped carbon for electrocatalysts. Notably, strong metal-substrate interaction (SMSI) was observed through various characterizations. The bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability toward oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction were significantly enhanced by the SMSI, The LAB demonstrated a high discharge capacity of 18,356 mAhg-1 at a current density of 200 mAg-1, maintaining a remarkable discharge capacity of 1,000 mAhg-1 even at a high current density of 400 mAg-1 for 200 cycles. CoFe2O4-decorated on bio-derived ABPBI holds promise as a practical air-breathing electrode for high-capacity rechargeable LABs.

Abstract Photoelectrically coupling water splitting at high current density is a promising approach for the acquisition of green hydrogen energy. However, it places significant demands on the photo/electrocatalysts. Herein, rare earth elements doping NiMoO 4 ‐based phosphorus/sulfide heterostructure nanorod arrays (RE‐NiMo‐PS@NF [RE = Y, Er, La, and Sc]) are obtained for solar‐enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting at high current densities. The results of the experiment and density‐functional theory studies illustrate that the Y element as a dopant not only makes the NiMoP 2 /NiMo 3 S 4 /NiMoO 4 heterostructure exhibit excellent solar‐enhanced electrocatalytic activity (hydrogen evolution reaction [HER]: η 1000 = 211 mV, oxygen evolution reaction [OER]: η 1000 = 367 mV) but also optimizes the heterostructure interfacial electron density distributions and HER free energy. In addition, Y‐NiMo‐PS@NF achieves 18.64% solar‐to‐hydrogen efficiency. This study not only provides a new way to synthesize heterostructure electrocatalysts but also inspires the application of solar enhancement strategies for high current density water splitting.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR), requiring less energy to produce hydrogen, is considered as a potential alternative to the traditional oxygen evolution reaction. Consequently, developing highly efficient UOR catalysts to facilitate H2 production has garnered widespread attention. A promising approach to enhancing the effectiveness of these electrocatalysts is defect engineering. By introducing structural defects, defect engineering can expose more active sites and optimize their electronic structure, thereby improving their activity. This work offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress in defect engineering of nickel-based electrocatalysts for the UOR. It summarizes various strategies for generating defects, including the creation of vacancies, doping, the incorporation of single atoms, amorphization, and achieving high refractivity. Furthermore, we discuss the advanced characterization techniques commonly used to identify the presence of defects in these electrocatalysts, as well as to determine their detailed structures. Finally, we outline the prospects and challenges associated with the systematic design and fabrication of novel UOR electrocatalysts with tunable defects, aiming to further enhance their efficiency and stability.

The electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction can reduce overpotential and can be connected in series with nonelectrochemical processes to achieve the preparation of more high-value compounds. Herein, Cu- and Co-incorporated nickel hydroxide (CuCo–Ni(OH)2) was synthesized and applied to the anodic benzylamine oxidation reaction, which is 280 mV lower than the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction to reach the current density of 50 mA cm–2. When the electrocatalytic oxidation of benzylamine and hydrogen evolution reaction are coupled to form an electrolytic cell, the potential to reach 10 mA cm–2 is reduced by 197 mV compared to the overall water splitting. The benzylamine is converted to benzamide with 99.3% conversion and 90.2% faraday efficiency under 1.45 V constant voltage electrolysis, and the catalytic performance remains at a high level after 4 cycles. The characterization and density functional theory calculations show that Cu and Co share the transfer charge from Ni, making it easy for CuCo–Ni(OH)2 to deprotonate Ni–O* sites. The formed Ni–O* sites exhibit lower energy barriers in the proton transfer of benzylamine to benzonitrile and hydration intermediates, resulting in a better catalytic performance of CuCo–Ni(OH)2 than Ni(OH)2 in the electrocatalytic oxidation of benzylamine to benzamide.

This study investigated the impact of acetone on the electrochemical behavior of polycrystalline platinum electrodes in 0.1 M NaOH solution, with respect to the kinetics of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) and indirectly to the underpotential deposition of hydrogen (UPDH). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were employed to analyze these processes for acetone concentrations ranging from 1.0 × 10−6 to 1.0 × 10−3 M. The addition of (CH3)2C=O enhanced the catalytic efficiency of alkaline water splitting, which was believed to be a result of a significant reduction in the surface tension phenomenon (due to mutual interaction of acetone and water molecules), thus considerably facilitating hydrogen bubble detachment from the Pt electrode. Key findings in this work are described with respect to facilitation of both the HER and the OER reactions’ kinetics by the presence of acetone (also undergoing Pt electroreduction over the potential range for UPDH) in the working solution, without an electrode surface poisoning effect. The latter implies significant opportunities for traces of organic additives into alkaline electrolyte to improve the industrial alkaline water electrolysis process.

Abstract Aiming to efficiently expedite alkaline overall water splitting (OWS) by addressing challenges such as sluggish kinetics and limited stability, a hollow Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 ‐NiS@Ni(OH) 2 nanorod array with surface nanosheets is devised, featuring a high‐index Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 (101)‐NiS(211) heterostructural interface and an upshifted d ‐band center. This nanoarchitecture intensifies the adsorption and interaction of H 2 O and OH − reactants on the electrocatalyst surface, suitably bonds the * H intermediate in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and accelerates electron movement of * H, minimizes the energy requirement of the rate‐limiting phase ( * OH → * O) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by facilitating O─H cleavage of * OH and optimally adsorbs * O, amplifies the exposure of surface‐active centers, and ultimately reduces the apparent activation energy. Consequently, the overpotentials are as low as 66.4 mV (HER) and 254.9 mV (OER) at 10 mA cm −2 , alongside high turnover frequencies of 142 s −1 (H 2 ) and 279 s −1 (O 2 ) at 100 and 300 mV, respectively, markedly outperforming direct‐electrodeposited analogues. When functioning as a bifunctional electrode in OWS, this material merely requires 1.57 V at 10 mA cm −2 and sustains an operation for 168 h, approaching Pt/C||RuO 2 benchmark.

Electrocatalysis has emerged as a pivotal field for sustainable energy and environmental solutions, fueling the development of diverse electrocatalysts over the past 2 decades. However, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamical processes governing electrochemical reactions remains elusive and is hampering efficient catalyst design. Surface-sensitive techniques like in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy are indispensable for characterizing these dynamic processes and guiding the development of novel catalysts. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in employing in situ/operando Raman techniques, with a particular emphasis on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), for probing various electrocatalytic systems. It discusses the development, advantages, and available configurations of these Raman techniques. Moreover, the review underscores the potential of in situ SERS in unraveling the intricate mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through innovative strategies and methodological advancements. Notably, leveraging SERS for novel OER catalysts, such as single-atom catalysts, metal–organic frameworks, and electrolyte–electrode interfaces, can unveil unexplored reaction pathways, guiding the development of superior catalytic materials. Overcoming challenges and harnessing SERS' capabilities can deepen our mechanistic understanding of the OER, enabling the rational design of efficient and durable electrocatalysts crucial for renewable energy advancement.

The precise regulation of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) with the desired local chemical environment is vital to elucidate the relationship between the SACs structure and the catalytic performance. The debate on the effect of the local coordination environment is quite complicated even for the SACs with the same composition and chemical nature, calling for increased attention on the regulation of second coordination shell. For oxide‐supported SACs, it remains a significant challenge to precisely manipulate the second coordination shell of single atoms supported on oxides due to the structural robustness of oxides. Here, Ir single atoms are anchored on NiO supports via different bonding strategies, resulting in the diverse Ir‐O‐Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. Specifically, Ir1/NiO, Ir1‐NiO, and Ir1@NiO SACs with increasing Ir‐O‐Ni coordination numbers of 3, 4, and 5 were synthesized, respectively. We found that the activity of the three samples towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibited a volcano‐shaped relationship with the Ir‐O‐Ni coordination number, with Ir1‐NiO showing the lowest overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm‐2. Mechanism investigations indicate that the moderate coordination number of Ir‐O‐Ni in Ir1‐NiO creates the higher occupied Ir dz2 orbital, weakening the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates and thereby enhancing the OER activity.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) frequently acts as a kinetic bottleneck in various energy storage and conversion systems. Effective electrocatalysts for the OER play a crucial role in reducing the reaction barrier and expediting the reaction. Multicomponent transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have garnered an extensive amount of attention as a result of their exceptional performance in the OER. Here, we present a direct method for preparing two intrinsic morphologies of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), barrel-like BMM-10 and pancake-like BMM-10(Ac), achieved by establishing a protonation/deprotonation equilibrium with varying NO3–/Ac– ratios. The BMM-10(Ac)-C catalyst was synthesized via heat treatment of the BMM-10(Ac) precursor, exhibiting superior OER performance. It realized an overpotential of 286 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2, with a Tafel slope of 111.17 mV decade–1 and a current retention of 98.03%. This improvement arises from the synergistic interaction between Ni3P/Ni nanoparticles and the partially graphitic carbon layer, augmenting the exposure of active sites. Furthermore, alterations in the morphological features of MOF-derived Ni3P/Ni carbon nanocomposites adjusted the active electrochemical surface area, thereby modulating the overall OER performance of the corresponding TMP carbon nanocomposites. This methodology can be extended to control the morphology of other MOFs and their derivatives, providing innovative avenues for the design and synthesis of new MOF-based TMP nanomaterials.

Eurypterids—Palaeozoic marine and freshwater arthropods commonly known as sea scorpions—repeatedly evolved to remarkable sizes (over 0.5 m in length) and colonized continental aquatic habitats multiple times. We compiled data on the majority of eurypterid species and explored several previously proposed explanations for the evolution of giant size in the group, including the potential role of habitat, sea surface temperature and dissolved sea surface oxygen levels, using a phylogenetic comparative approach with a new tip-dated tree. There is no compelling evidence that the evolution of giant size was driven by temperature or oxygen levels, nor that it was coupled with the invasion of continental aquatic environments, latitude or local faunal diversity. Eurypterid body size evolution is best characterized by rapid bursts of change that occurred independently of habitat or environmental conditions. Intrinsic factors played a major role in determining the convergent origin of gigantism in eurypterids.

Abstract Analyzing laser-produced plasmas (LPP) in a controlled oxygen-containing environment provides insight into the formation and evolution of molecular species through gas-phase oxidation. This study explores the role of ambient pressure and oxygen availability in forming SiO molecular species in laser ablation plumes. The self-emission emanating during the reactive ablation of Si targets was characterized by optical emission spectroscopy and optical time-of-flight techniques. Our results showed that the SiO species formation was greatly influenced by both the ambient pressure and oxygen availability. The intensity and the persistence of SiO emission bands are lower at higher oxygen concentrations, indicating they are depopulated by the formation of more complex silicon oxides. The oxygen partial pressure effects on plume chemistry showed that SiO formation is favored even with a minimal oxygen concentration in the environment.

Extensive research on transition metal perovskite oxides as electrodes in solid oxide cells (SOC) has highlighted the potential ability of Fe-based perovskite oxides to catalyze oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). The layered perovskite-type system YSr2Cu2FeO7+δ has been reported to possess attractive electrocatalytic properties. This work applies density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate oxygen ion diffusion in the YSr2Cu2FeO7+δ system. For δ = 0.5, it is found that in the most stable configuration, the oxygen vacancies in the FeO1+δ plane are arranged to form Fe ions in tetrahedral, square pyramid, and octahedral coordination. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations for YSr2Cu2FeO7.5 (δ = 0.5) yield an oxygen ion diffusion coefficient of 1.28 × 10−7 cm2/s at 500 °C (Ea = 0.37 eV). Complementary results for YSr2Cu2FeO7.2 (δ = 0.2) and YSr2Cu2FeO7.75 (δ = 0.75) indicate that the oxygen diffusion occurs in the FeO1+δ plane, and depends on the oxygen vacancies distribution around the Fe centers.

Low-oxygen (oxygen concentration below 18.5%) phenomena often occur in the top coal caving working face of ultrathick coal seams, posing a serious threat to the safety of workers. The characteristics of oxygen consumption and gas production at low-constant temperature and the corresponding functional group evolution of residual coal in goaf were studied by temperature-programmed and infrared spectrum experiments. The influence of different factors on the emission of low-oxygen gases was studied through numerical calculation. The results show that low-temperature oxygen consumption and gas production occurred when the coal was about 40 °C. When the temperature was constant, the oxygen consumption and gas production rate increased with the extension of time. In the early stage of coal oxidation, the aliphatic C–H components were attacked by oxygen molecules and reacted with them. The asymmetric methyl and methylene groups were more likely to oxidize and produce carbonyl compounds. With the increase of nitrogen injection, the overall width of the oxidation zone (oxygen concentration was defined as 10–18%) narrowed, and the range of the oxidation zone moved forward from the depth of the goaf. The oxygen concentration in the air return corner decreased gradually, and the low-oxygen area in the air return corner expanded gradually. The distance between the low-oxygen area of the working face and the air intake corner was gradually shortened. With the increase of air intake, the width of the oxidation zone increased and moved to the depth of goaf, and the degree of low oxygen in the air return corner increased. The research results are of great significance for the understanding and prevention of the low-oxygen phenomenon in ultrathick coal seams.

Abstract The inverse problem of reconstructing two space-varying coefficients in a system of one-dimensional (1-d) time-dependent advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equations is considered. The ADR system can be used as a water quality model which describes the evolution of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in a river or stream. The coefficients to be reconstructed represents the effect of the deoxygenation and superficial reaeration processes on the DO and BOD concentration in water. Hölder stability estimates for the coefficients of interest are established using the Carleman estimate technique.

Due to the strong reducibility and chemical activity of rare earths, the diffusion behavior and secondary oxidation of rare earths in the steel liquid will also have a significant impact on the modified products when rare earths are added to bearing steel, resulting in poor control of distribution behavior. Therefore, this paper studies the influence of time factors on the evolution of rare earth inclusions. The inclusion evolution behavior at different times when the bearing steel was treated with rare earths and subjected to secondary oxidation was simulated at 1873 K (1600 °C). At a cerium content of 0.012% in steel and a secondary oxidation of 0.0025%, the cerium content in steel and the total oxygen (T.O.) content in steel were determined at the 30 s, 3 min, 5 min, and 7 min after the addition and the inclusions were characterized by automatic scanning electron microscopy. The results demonstrated the formation of a cerium-enriched zone after the addition of the cerium alloy to the steel. As time progressed, a considerable number of inclusions were generated in the cerium-enriched zone, which subsequently disappeared. The trend in the composition of the inclusions can be described as Al2O3 → Ce2O2S + CeS → Ce2O2S. The final composition of the inclusions matches the thermodynamic phase diagram. Following the addition of the transient oxidant Fe2O3 to the molten steel, an oxygen-enriched zone was formed. As time progressed, a considerable number of inclusions were generated in the oxygen-enriched zone and subsequently disappeared. The trend of inclusions composition was as follows: Ce2O3 + CeAlO3 + Al2O3 → Ce2O3 + CeAlO3 → Ce2O2S + CeAlO3. The final inclusion composition coincides with the thermodynamic phase diagram.

Abstract Fewer layer graphene principally has a higher surface area to support more catalytic sites for energy conversion, but it is still challenging to synthesize monolayer graphene without oxidation from graphite at a low cost. Here, a method for synergistically thinning graphene layers and constructing catalytic sites to create a superior bifunctional oxygen catalyst through vapor intercalation of multi‐layer graphene or its derivatives is described. The synthesized small sheet sizes of 1–2 layer graphene‐supported FeN 4 and FeCo active sites exhibit superior reversible activity of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions with a low overall overpotential of 0.648 V. The sheet‐shaped catalyst is further used to fabricate flexible soft‐packed and wearable cable‐type quasi‐solid‐state zinc–air batteries, achieving high performances (>188 mW cm −2 , >450 cycles) and enabling smartphone charging. DFT calculations reveal that fewer layer graphene coupled with atomic FeN 4 and alloy FeCo sites enables lower Gibbs free energy for favorable OOH* intermediate adsorption/desorption benefiting superior oxygen redox process. This study introduces a strategy for scalable synthesis of 1–2 layer graphene from cheap microcrystalline graphite minerals for wearable and durable energy devices.

Metal-poor massive stars drive the evolution of low-mass galaxies, both locally and at high redshift. However, quantifying the feedback they impart to their local surroundings remains uncertain because models of stellar evolution, mass loss, and ionizing spectra are unconstrained by observations below 20% solar metallicity ($Z_\odot$). We present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager optical spectroscopy of three O stars in the nearby dwarf galaxies Leo P, Sextans A, and WLM, which have gas-phase oxygen abundances of 3-14% $Z_\odot$. To characterize their fundamental stellar properties and radiation-driven winds, we fit PoWR atmosphere models to the optical spectra simultaneously with Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra and multi-wavelength photometry. We find that all three stars have effective temperatures consistent with their spectral types and surface gravities typical of main-sequence dwarf stars. Yet, the combination of those inferred parameters and luminosity for the two lower-$Z$ stars is not reproduced by stellar evolution models, even those that include rotation or binary interactions. The scenario of multiple-star systems is difficult to reconcile with all available data, suggesting that these observations pose a challenge to current evolution models. We highlight the importance of validating the relationship between stellar mass, temperature, and luminosity at very low $Z$ for accurate estimates of ionizing photon production and spectral hardness. Finally, all three stars' FUV wind profiles reveal low mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities in tension with expectations from widely adopted radiation-driven wind models. These results provide empirical benchmarks for future development of mass-loss and evolution models for metal-poor stellar populations.

Magnetite, a common mineral in alkaline magmatic complexes hosting giant epithermal Au deposits, is examined to obtain insights into the magmatic evolution and ore fertility of alkaline systems. Textural and compositional analyses of magmatic magnetite from Cripple Creek, USA, and Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, reveal distinct magma sources and evolution paths. High HFSE concentrations and high La/Yb ratios in magnetite from Cripple Creek suggest relatively low-degree partial melting of lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle sources, whereas magnetite from Lihir Island indicates higher degree partial melting from subduction-modified mantle. Chromium concentrations track magma evolution, while V systematics record decreasing oxygen fugacity with magma differentiation. Sulfide saturation is observed at Cripple Creek, potentially affecting ore fertility. Magnetite itself bears the capability to scavenge Au from melts as indicated by Au concentrations of up to 40 ng/g. This might point towards elevated Au concentrations in the parental magmas, although experimental data on Au partitioning is lacking. Magnetite compositions overlap across different mineralization styles, challenging its reliability as an exploration tool but analysis of noble metals in magnetite and its inclusion cargo could offer promising alternative approaches. Overall, magnetite serves as a valuable tool for investigating ore deposit petrogenesis and holds potential for exploration.

Abstract. The Devonian is a warmer-than-present geological period spanning from 419 to 359 million years ago (Ma) characterized by multiple identified ocean anoxic/hypoxic events. Despite decades of extensive investigation, no consensus has been reached regarding the drivers of these anoxic events. While growing geological evidence has demonstrated a temporal correlation between astronomical forcing and anoxia during this period, underlying physical mechanisms remain unknown, hence questioning causality. Here, we perform multiple sensitivity experiments, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (cGENIE), to isolate the influences of specific Devonian climate and palaeogeography components on ocean oxygen levels, contributing to the better understanding of the intricate interplay of factors preconditioning the ocean to anoxia. We quantify the impact of continental configuration, ocean-atmosphere biogeochemistry (global mean oceanic PO4 concentration and atmospheric pO2), climatic forcing (pCO2) and astronomical forcing on background oceanic circulation and oxygenation during the Devonian. Our results indicate that continental configuration is crucial for Devonian ocean anoxia, significantly influencing ocean circulation and oxygen levels while consistently modulating the effects of other Devonian climate components such as oceanic PO4 concentration, atmospheric pO2 and pCO2, and orbital forcing. The evolution of continental configuration provides a plausible explanation for the increased frequency of ocean anoxic events identified during the Middle and Late Devonian periods, as it contributed to the expansion of oxygen-depleted zones. Our simulations also show that both the decreased atmospheric pO2 and increased oceanic PO2 concentration exacerbate ocean anoxia, consistent with established knowledge. The variation of pCO2 reveals a wide range of ocean dynamics patterns, including stable oscillations, multiple convection cells, multistability and hysteresis; all leading to significant variations of the ocean oxygen levels, therefore strongly impacting the preconditioning of the ocean to anoxia. Furthermore, multistability and important hysteresis (particularly slow ocean time response) offer different mechanisms to account for the prolonged duration of some ocean anoxic events. Finally, we found that astronomical forcing substantially impacts ocean anoxia by altering ocean circulation and oxygen solubility, with obliquity consistently emerging as the primary orbital parameter driving ocean oxygen variations.

For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory of photocatalysis or the screening charge effect of electrochemical catalysis. Due to the formation of different intermediate active‐species during two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro‐ and photo‐catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro‐, photo‐, and piezo‐catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB‐OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in‐situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo‐catalysis over BOB‐OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo‐catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo‐catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo‐catalysis rather than electro‐catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo‐catalysis.

For the treatment of wastewater, biological fuel cells (BFCs) using heterotrophic microorganisms have received much attention in the last 15 years. Lately, electrochemical devices such as BFCs using oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms (OPhM) that can simultaneously perform wastewater treatment, biomass synthesis, O2 evolution, and electricity generation have begun to receive special consideration. In this chapter we aim to summarize the main published results in this growing field of wastewater treatment, focusing on different BFCs that use OPhM in the anode or cathode compartment, as well as to propose some future trends. These trends are based on OPhM's already-proven abilities to donate electrons directly to the anode or to receive electrons directly from the cathode, with significant expectations from the appropriate genetic modification of living cells, as well as the modification of electrodes at the nanoscale level.

Abstract Li-rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathodes have been regarded as promising candidates for next-generation Li-ion batteries due to their exceptionally high energy density, which combines cationic and anionic redox activities. However, continuous voltage decay during cycling remains the primary obstacle for practical applications, which has yet to be fundamentally addressed. It is widely acknowledged that voltage decay originates from the irreversible migration of transition metal ions, which usually further exacerbates structural evolution and aggravates the irreversible oxygen redox reactions. Recently, constructing O2-type structure has been considered one of the most promising approaches for inhibiting voltage decay. In this review, the relationship between voltage decay and structural evolution is systematically elucidated. Strategies to suppress voltage decay are systematically summarized. Additionally, the design of O2-type structure and the corresponding mechanism of suppressing voltage decay are comprehensively discussed. Unfortunately, the reported O2-type LRLO cathodes still exhibit partially disordered structure with extended cycles. Herein, the factors that may cause the irreversible transition metal migrations in O2-type LRLO materials are also explored, while the perspectives and challenges for designing high-performance O2-type LRLO cathodes without voltage decay are proposed.

Abstract It is well known that the properties of a crystal evolve as it increases in size from a single atomic plane to that of the bulk. Such size‐dependent transitions can stem from many different origins and depend on minute changes to crystal bonding and composition. A model example is that of LaCoO 3 , which is non‐magnetic in the bulk but can display ferromagnetism at the nanoscale. Here, the evolution of structure‐property relationships is studied in the LaCoO 3−δ /SrTiO 3 (001) system as the thickness of LaCoO 3−δ is increased from a single plane to 10 unit cells. In situ synchrotron X‐ray studies are performed during and post‐deposition to probe changes in the interactions between structure, stoichiometry, and magnetic behavior. Structural quantification indicates that the oxygen octahedral rotation pattern evolves with thickness, due to inherent differences in crystal symmetry between the film and substrate. The change in rotation modifies the required energy barrier for the spin state transition via the Co–O bond length and Co–O–Co bond angle, affecting the appearance of ferromagnetism. Our results highlight the contributions of high spin Co 2+ and/or high spin Co 3+ to respective weak and robust ferromagnetism and the evolution of properties with size in ultrathin LaCoO 3−δ heterostructures.

BACKGROUND: The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) performance of individuals with subclinical and early stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have not been systematically studied. Improved understanding will inform the natural history of HCM and factors influencing well-being. METHODS: VANISH trial (Valsartan for Attenuating Disease Evolution in Early Sarcomeric HCM) participants with early stage sarcomeric HCM (primary analysis cohort) and subclinical HCM (sarcomere variant without left ventricular hypertrophy comprising the exploratory cohort) who completed baseline and year 2 HRQOL assessment via the pediatric quality of life inventory and CPET were studied. Metrics correlating with baseline HRQOL and CPET performance were identified. The impact of valsartan treatment on these measures was analyzed in the early stage cohort. RESULTS: Two hundred participants were included: 166 with early stage HCM (mean age, 23±10 years; 40% female; 97% White; and 92% New York Heart Association class I) and 34 subclinical sarcomere variant carriers (mean age, 16±5 years; 50% female; and 100% White). Baseline HRQOL was good in both cohorts, although slightly better in subclinical HCM (composite pediatric quality of life score 84.6±10.6 versus 90.2±9.8; P =0.005). Both cohorts demonstrated mildly reduced functional status (mean percent predicted peak oxygen uptake 73±16 versus 78±12 mL/kg per minute; P =0.18). Percent predicted peak oxygen uptake and peak oxygen pulse correlated with HRQOL. Valsartan improved physical HRQOL in early stage HCM (adjusted mean change in pediatric quality of life score +4.1 versus placebo; P =0.01) but did not significantly impact CPET performance. CONCLUSIONS: Functional capacity can be impaired in young, healthy people with early stage HCM, despite New York Heart Association class I status and good HRQOL. Peak oxygen uptake was similarly decreased in subclinical HCM despite normal left ventricular wall thickness and excellent HRQOL. Valsartan improved physical pediatric quality of life scores but did not significantly impact CPET performance. Further studies are needed for validation and to understand how to improve patient experience. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov ; Unique identifier: NCT01912534.

Abstract Intergranular oxidation (IGO) of the Ni-based superalloy Inconel 718 was studied at 650 °C, 700 °C and 900 °C. The oxidized samples were characterized by X -ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. For all the studied temperatures, the external scale was mainly composed of Cr 2 O 3 , while the oxides along the grain boundaries were rich in Al and, to a minor extent, Ti. This was consistent with thermodynamic computations. The time evolution of the maximum depth of IGO was found to be parabolic with an apparent activation energy of 164 kJ/mol. The results of this study confirm with three temperatures that IGO kinetics can be described using an extension of the Wagner’s theory of internal oxidation, as recently suggested in the literature at 850 °C. According to this description, the mechanisms controlling the IGO kinetics of Inconel 718 are the aluminum diffusion in the alloy matrix and the oxygen diffusion along the interface between the alloy matrix and the oxidized grain boundary.

Usually, deep oil and gas accumulation is often controlled by strike–slip faults. However, in the Tarim Basin, deep Ordovician oil and gas accumulations are also found in areas far from the fault zone. The process of oil and gas accumulation in deep reservoirs far from strike–slip fault zones is still unclear at present. The source and evolution of Ordovician fluids were analyzed using inclusion geochemical methods and the U–Pb dating technique. The analysis of rare earth elements and carbon–oxygen–strontium isotopes in the reservoirs showed that the reservoirs were weakly modified by diagenetic fluid. The fluid was derived from the fluid formation during the same period as the seawater, and no oxidizing fluid invaded the reservoir. The late oil and gas reservoirs had good sealing properties. The U–Pb dating results combined with homogenization temperature data revealed that the first-stage oil was charged during the Late Caledonian Period, and the second-stage natural gas was charged during the Middle Yanshanian Period. The evolution of the paleo-pressure showed that the charging of natural gas in the Middle Yanshanian was the main reason for the formation of reservoir overpressure. The strike–slip fault zone was basically inactive in the Middle Yanshanian. During this period, the charged natural gas mainly migrated to the reservoir along the unconformity surface and the open strike–slip fault zone in the upper part of the Ordovician reservoir. The source of the fluid shows that the reservoir in the late stage had good sealing properties, and there was no intrusion of exogenous fluid. The overpressure in the reservoir is well preserved at present.

Changes in the composition, structure, and thickness of riverbed sediments caused by riverbed clogging strongly affect the hydraulic connection, migration and transformation of nutrients between river water and groundwater in groundwater source areas. However, previous studies have not extensively investigated the mechanisms of river-aquifer disconnection and the migration and transformation processes of iron and manganese under non-time-varying and time-varying conditions of riverbed permeability. This study developed a model using the COMSOL Multiphysics platform to characterize the riverbed clogging-groundwater exploitation-disconnection process, considering microbial growth and related biogeochemical processes, and investigated feedbacks between the reactive migration of iron and manganese and physical clogging-groundwater exploitation processes or bioclogging processes. The research findings showed that under non-time-varying conditions of riverbed permeability, the evolution of river-aquifer disconnection was strongly affected by the thickness and permeability coefficient of riverbed sediments. The dissolved oxygen attenuation rate in the disconnection zone decreased by up to 88.8 %. Additionally, the Mn

Peatlands are highly sensitive ecosystems that respond to hydrological, climatic, and geomorphological changes. In this study, we investigate the origin and historical evolution of a peatland located in Northeastern Romania, on the Suceava plateau. Our approach includes the analysis of historical maps and physical characteristics of both the peat (grain size, LOI - loss on ignition) and water (pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity). Our findings suggest that the development of this peatland has been more prominent along the surface than the depth. The presence of gravel and sand at the base of the peat deposit, along with surface morphological evidence, supports the hypothesis that this peatland originated in an ancient paleomeander. pH analysis indicates that the peatland is mesotrophic, while granulometric and LOI analyses suggest a fluviogenic origin.The significant changes observed in the sedimentary structure of the peatland may be attributed to climate change, with potential anthropogenic influences over the past 50 years. Furthermore, our study contributes valuable insights to geomorphological research in the Suceava valley, revealing visible changes spanning the last 250 years.

Dopants can significantly affect the properties of oxide ceramics through their impact on the property-determined microstructure characteristics such as grain boundary segregation, space charge layer formation in the grain boundary vicinity, and the resultant microstructure features like bimodality due to abnormal grain growth. To support rational oxide ceramics design, we propose a multiphysics-based and defect-chemistry-informed phase-field grain growth model to simulate the microstructure evolution of oxide ceramics. It fully respects the thermodynamics of charged point defects (oxygen vacancies and dopants) in both the grain interior and boundaries and considers the competing kinetics of defect diffusion and grain boundary movement. The proposed phase-field model is benchmarked against well-known simplified bicrystal models, including the Mott-Schottky and Gouy-Chapman models. Various simulation results are presented to reveal the impacts of defect formation energy differences between the grain interior and the grain boundary core on the key microstructural aspects. In particular, simulation results confirm that the solute drag effect alone can lead to bimodal grain size distribution, without any contribution from grain misorientation and other anisotropy. Interestingly, abnormal grain growth simulations demonstrate that grain boundary potentials can vary substantially: grain boundaries of larger grains tend to have lower potentials than those of smaller grains. Such heterogeneous grain boundary potential distribution may inspire a new material optimization strategy through microstructure design. This study provides a comprehensive framework for defect-chemistry-consistent investigations of microstructure evolution in polycrystalline oxide ceramics, offering fundamental insights into in-situ processes during critical manufacturing stages.

Photocatalytic degradation of pollutants coupled with hydrogen (H2) evolution has emerged as a promising solution for environmental and energy crises. However, the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes limits photocatalytic activities. Herein, an S-scheme heterojunction carbon doped-TiO2 /ZnIn2S4 (C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4) was designed by substituting oxygen sites within C-TiO2 by ZnIn2S4. Under visible light irradiation, the optimal C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 exhibits a higher degradation efficiency (88.6%) of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), compared to pristine C-TiO2 (72.9%) and ZnIn2S4 (66.8%). Furthermore, the H2 yield of the C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 reaches 1526.9 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is 3.83 times and 2.87 times that of the C-TiO2 and ZnIn2S4, respectively. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that an internal electric field (IEF) informed in the C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction, accelerates the separation of photogenerated charge pairs, thereby enhancing photocatalytic efficiency of MC-LR degradation and H2 production. This work highlights a new perspective on the development of high-performance photocatalysts for wastewater treatment and H2 generation.

The paper delves deeply into crucial subjects spanning the birth of our solar system to humanitys ascendancy on Earth. It aims to enable humankind to gain a deeper understanding of our own origins and the Earths genesis and evolution. Given that Earth is our sole habitat, we must gain insights into the conditions necessary for it to sustain life or identify potential terrestrial planets suitable for human habitation. Throughout its history, Earth has weathered countless encounters with meteorites, comets, and asteroids, dating back to the formation of the solar system. These events, though rare, played a pivotal role in shaping our planets atmosphere, magnetic field, and unique environmental characteristics. Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of Earths history is the emergence of life itselfa true marvel. Starting with single-celled protists, life evolved into complex multicellular organisms. Yet, a pivotal moment in Earths history came with a momentous global extinction event triggered by the rise of oxygen. This event reshaped the planets natural ecosystem, leading to the extinction of many species and the emergence of new ones. Humanitys own journey, navigating the depths of history, eventually led to our dominance over the Earth.

In the metal matrix composites (MMCs) reinforced with nanoparticles, the enhancement of composite performance is often closely associated with the types of nanoparticles. It is vital to explore the influences and differences of various nanoparticles on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of highly alloyed aluminum-based composites. This study is the first to employ hot pressing for preparing Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite materials reinforced with SiC and Al 2 O 3 nano-ceramic particles, respectively. By employing hot extrusion and T6 heat treatment techniques, a systematic investigation was conducted on the effects of the addition of nano-ceramic particles on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composites, and a comparative analysis was performed on the two types of composite materials. The experimental results demonstrated that the Mg atoms in the α-Al matrix were consumed by the addition of SiC/Al 2 O 3 nano-ceramic particles, and thereby the grain size primary η’ (MgZn 2 ) strengthening phase was refined, leading to an enhanced overall mechanical performance of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite. In particular, the Mg 2 Si phase was generated by the addition of SiC nanoceramic particles, through the interfacial reactions, and thus with the synergistic effects of precipitation strengthening and Orowan strengthening, the ultimate compressive strength and compressibility of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite can be increased to 844 MPa and 27.5%, respectively. On the other hand, the addition of Al 2 O 3 nanoceramic particles can bring about the formation of an oxygen-rich phase and refined precipitates at grain boundaries. Accordingly, the elongation is increased to 43.5% while a high ultimate compressive strength in the composites can be maintained. It is anticipated that nanoceramic particle-reinforced Al-based metal composites have significant potential for achieving both high strength and exceptional ductility for the application in the industry field.

Abstract The metal‐free rocking chair type Zn‐ion batteries (ZIBs) provide a promising approach toward the promotion of the Zn‐based batteries by circumventing the challenges including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and surface corrosion. In order to sufficiently exploit the available capacity of this metal‐free batteries, it is necessary to effectively enhance the sluggish reaction kinetics of divalent zinc ions. Equally important is to achieve a balance in the kinetics between cathode and anode. Here, hetero‐valent doping and oxygen vacancy engineering are employed to effectively enhance the reaction dynamics of V 2 O 5 cathodes and MoO 3 anodes. Moreover, to the best of the knowledge, for the first time, the strategy of kinetics matching between the two electrodes is applied to the construction of rocking‐chair zinc ion batteries, enabling the cathode and anode to share similar zinc ion migration rates, and achieving a high energy density of up to 58.7 Wh kg −1 (based on the total electrode mass) as well as excellent cycling stability (90% after 500 cycles). This work demonstrates the importance of kinetics matching in zinc‐ion full‐cell performance and pave a benefitable avenue to for the pursuit of advanced multi‐valent metal‐ion batteries.

Abstract Modulating the electronic properties of transition metal sites in photocatalysts at the atomic level is essential for achieving high‐activity carbon dioxide photoreduction (CO 2 PR). An electronic strategy is herein proposed to engineer In‐d‐band center of InVO 4 by incorporating MnO x nanoparticles and oxygen vacancies (V O ) into holey InVO 4 nanobelts (MnO x /V O ‐InVO 4 ), which synergistically modulates the In‐d‐band center to a moderate level and consequently leads to high‐efficiency CO 2 PR. The MnO x /V O ‐InVO 4 catalyst with optimized electronic property exhibits a single carbon evolution rate of up to 145.3 µmol g −1 h −1 and a carbon monoxide (CO) product selectivity of 92.6%, coming out in front of reported InVO 4 ‐based materials. It is discovered that the modulated electronic property favors the interaction between the In sites and their intermediates, which thereby improves the thermodynamics and kinetics of the CO 2 PR‐to‐CO reaction. This work not only demonstrates the effective engineering of the d orbital of the low‐coordination In atoms to promote CO 2 PR, but also paves the way for the application of tuning d‐band center to develop high‐efficiency catalysts.

Understanding the similarities and differences between adding or removing electrons from a charge-transfer insulator may provide insights about the origin of the electron-hole asymmetry found in cuprates. Here we study with cellular dynamical mean-field theory the Emery model set in the charge-transfer insulator regime, and dope it with either electrons or holes. We consider the normal state only and focus on the doping evolution of the orbital character of the dopants and on the nature of the doping driven transition. Regarding the orbital character of the dopants, we found an electron-hole asymmetry: doped electrons mostly enter the copper orbitals, whereas doped holes mostly enter the oxygen orbitals. Regarding the nature of the doping driven transition, we found no qualitative electron-hole asymmetry: upon either electron or hole doping, there is a two-stage transition from a charge-transfer insulator to a strongly correlated pseudogap and then to a metal. This shows that a strongly correlated pseudogap is an emergent feature of doped correlated insulators in two dimensions, in qualitative agreement with recent experiments on ambipolar Sr$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ cuprate films. Our results indicate that merely doping with holes or electrons a charge-transfer insulator is not sufficient for explaining the electron-hole asymmetry observed in the normal state phase diagram of cuprates. Our work reinforces the view that actual hole-doped cuprates are more correlated than their electron-doped counterparts.

Abstract We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of ∼20 au that straddles the L–T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with on-axis host star spectra, which provides self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 ± 3 km s −1 and carbon monoxide and water mass fractions of logCO = −2.3 ± 0.3 and logH 2 O = −2.7 ± 0.2, respectively. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 ± 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 ± 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L–T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high v sin i and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures to which we are sensitive. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation to the breakup velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of >200 very low-mass objects ( M ≲ 0.1 M ⊙ ) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated low-mass field objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.

Abstract Statistically ion and electron densities are enhanced above strong crustal magnetic field regions according to measurements made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. Plasma created by ionization of neutrals in the lower ionosphere (where chemistry dominates) flows upward and becomes trapped on closed magnetic field loops. Enhanced ion density in the ionosphere (particularly O 2+) is associated with enhanced photochemical escape of atomic oxygen. This paper presents a quasi‐1D multi‐fluid time‐dependent model of the Martian ionosphere for nine ion species. Ionospheric temperatures are adopted but ion densities and velocities (along the field lines) are determined using a numerical solution of the continuity and momentum equations. Diurnal effects are explored by varying photoionization rates. Three crustal field cases are considered: a low altitude closed, a high altitude closed, and a high altitude open field line. Additionally, a case with no crustal field is modeled to provide a comparison between regions with and without crustal fields in the upper Martian ionosphere. Model results show higher ion and electron densities in the crustal field cases than in the purely induced field case. Additionally, we find that densities are generally higher on the closed field lines than on the open field lines, and ion velocities are generally up the field lines, away from the Martian surface. We also find that velocities are larger on the open field line case. We compare modeled density results to MAVEN data and find general agreement. Implications for atmospheric escape, particularly photochemical escape of O, are also discussed.

Abstract. Aerosol particles play critical roles in climate and human health. However, aerosol composition and evolution, particularly secondary organic aerosol (SOA), and aerosol interactions with clouds in high-altitude background areas in China remain less understood. Here, we conducted real-time measurements of submicron aerosols (PM1) using aerosol mass spectrometers at a forested mountain site (1128 m a.s.l.) in southeastern China in November 2022. The average (±1σ) PM1 mass concentration was 4.3±4.8 µg m−3, which was ubiquitously lower than that at other mountain sites in China. Organic aerosol (OA) constituted the largest fraction of PM1 (42.9 %) and was predominantly secondary, as indicated by the high oxygen-to-carbon (O / C) ratio (0.85–0.96) and carbon oxidation state (0.21–0.49). Notably, the remarkably enhanced PM1 concentrations observed during the daytime on cloudless days were identified to be likely to be produced from cloud evaporation. While more oxidized oxygenated OA was scavenged efficiently during cloud events, cloud evaporation was found to release a significant amount of less oxidized oxygenated OA from air masses transported from polluted regions. The distinct decrease in OA / ΔCO with the increase in O / C during the cloud evaporative period further demonstrates that OA remaining in cloud droplets is generally in a moderate oxidation state. Moreover, organic nitrates were also estimated and showed a higher contribution to the total nitrate during the cloudy period (27 %) than during the evaporative period (3 %). Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of SOA and the influences of cloud processes in regional mountain areas in southeastern China.

The African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) assumes significance in aquaculture, given its role as a farmed freshwater species with modified gill structures functioning as an air-breathing organ (ABO). To provide a scientific basis for further elucidating the air-breathing formation mechanism and deeply utilizing the genetic resources of Clarias gariepinus, we utilized the PacBio sequencing platform to acquire a comprehensive full-length transcriptome from five juvenile developmental stages and various adult tissues, including the ABO, gills, liver, skin, and muscle. We generated 25,766,688 high-quality reads, with an average length of 2,006 bp and an N50 of 2,241 bp. Following rigorous quality control, 34,890 (97.7 %) of the high-quality isoforms were mapped to the reference genome for gene and transcript annotation, yielding 387 novel isoforms and 14,614 new isoforms. Additionally, we identified 28,582 open reading frames, 48 SNPs, 5,464 variable splices, and 6,141 variable polyadenylation sites, along with 475 long non-coding RNAs. Many DEGs were involved with low oxygen GO terms and KEGG pathways, such as response to stimulus, biological regulation and catalytic activities. Furthermore, it was found that transcription factors such as zf-C2H2, Homeobox, bHLH, and MYB could underpin the African sharptooth catfish's developmental plasticity and its capacity to adapt its morphology and function to its environment. Through the comprehensive analysis of its genomic characteristics, it was found that the African sharptooth catfish has developed a series of unique respiratory adaptive mechanisms during the evolutionary process, These results not only advances the understanding of genetic adaptations to hypoxia in Clarias fish but also provides a valuable framework for future studies aimed at improving aquaculture practices,besides provide important references and inspirations for the evolution of aquatic organisms.

In this study, we synthesized pure and cobalt-doped NiTiO3 perovskite nanostructures using a sol–gel method and characterized them to investigate the impact of cobalt incorporation on their photocatalytic hydrogen production under UV light. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of the hexagonal ilmenite structure, with lattice parameters increasing with cobalt doping, indicating the substitution of larger Co2+ ions onto smaller Ni2+ sites. Raman spectroscopy revealed a decrease in the intensity of active modes, suggesting crystal structure distortion and oxygen vacancy generation. UV-vis spectroscopy showed a decrease in bandgap energy from 2.24 to 2.16 eV with cobalt doping up to 5%, enhancing UV light absorption. SEM and TEM images revealed nanoparticle agglomeration, while cobalt doping did not significantly alter particle size up to 5% doping. Photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed an initial increase in PL intensity for NiTiO3-1%Co, followed by a systematic decrease with higher cobalt concentrations, with NiTiO3-10%Co exhibiting the lowest intensity. Photocatalytic experiments demonstrated a remarkable improvement in hydrogen evolution rate with increasing cobalt doping, with NiTiO3-10%Co exhibiting the highest rate of 940 μmol∙g−1·h−1, a 60.4% increase compared to pure NiTiO3. This enhanced performance is attributed to the substitution of Co2+ on Ni2+ sites, the modification of electronic structure, the suppression of electron–hole recombination, and the creation of surface catalytic sites induced by cobalt incorporation. The proposed mechanism involves the introduction of Co2+/Co3+ energy levels within the NiTiO3 bandgap, facilitating charge separation and transfer, with the Co+/Co2+ redox couple aiding in suppressing electron–hole recombination. These findings highlight the potential of cobalt doping to tune the properties of NiTiO3 perovskite for efficient hydrogen production under UV light.

A rich inventory of complex organic molecules (COMs) has been observed in high abundances in the gas phase toward Class 0 protostars. These molecules are suggested to be formed in ices and sublimate in the warm inner envelope close to the protostar. However, only the most abundant COM, methanol (CH3OH), has been firmly detected in ices before the era of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Now it is possible to detect the interstellar ices of other COMs and constrain their ice column densities quantitatively. We aim to determine the column densities of several oxygen-bearing COMs (O-COMs) in both gas and ice for two low-mass protostellar sources, NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and B1-c, as case studies in our JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program. By comparing the column density ratios w.r.t. CH3OH between both phases measured in the same sources, we can probe into the evolution of COMs from ice to gas in the early stages of star formation. We are able to fit the fingerprints range of COM ices between 6.8 and 8.8 um in the JWST/MIRI-MRS spectra of B1-c using similar components as recently used for IRAS 2A. We claim detection of CH4, OCN-, HCOO-, HCOOH, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and CH3COCH3 in B1-c, and upper limits are estimated for SO2, CH3COOH, and CH3CN. The comparison of O-COM ratios w.r.t CH3OH between ice and gas shows two different cases. 1) the column density ratios of CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 match well between the two phases, which may be attributed to a direct inheritance from ice to gas or strong chemical links with CH3OH. 2) the ice ratios of CH3CHO and C2H5OH w.r.t. CH3OH are higher than the gas ratios by 1-2 orders of magnitudes. This difference can be explained by the gas-phase reprocessing following sublimation, or different spatial distributions of COMs in the envelope.

(1,2) The thermodynamic energy requirement to split water is 1.23 V, and when kinetic and ohmic losses are accounted for, around 1.6 V (±0.2 V) of photovoltage must be generated by the SC. (3−5) Naturally, higher efficiencies can be achieved using multiple SC light absorbers. (6) For example, a combination of two SCs with band gaps between 1 and 1.4 eV for the bottom SC, and 1.7–2.1 eV for the top SC, has a maximum solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of over 10%, which could be commercially viable for certain device architectures. (7,8) Silicon, with a band gap of ∼1.1 eV, has emerged as a viable candidate as a low-band-gap SC material, mainly due to its earth abundance and use in the solar cell industry. (9)One problem with using Si in photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices is its lack of stability under reaction conditions. (10,11) This is particularly the case for highly oxidizing OER conditions where the operating potential of the EC needs to be above ∼1.6 V vs RHE. Under these conditions, there is a strong thermodynamic driving force to oxidize the Si SC. (12) As shown in Figure 1a, similar issues impact a range of other optically attractive SCs with band gaps between 1.0 and 2.4 eV. In a large majority of cases, the SC light absorbers are thermodynamically or kinetically easier to oxidize than water. (13) As a result, the SC will either passivate to form a stable surface oxide or corrode to dissolve into the solution.Figure 1Figure 1. (a) Band edge positions (V vs NHE) at pH = 0 for common SCs used in photoelectrochemical devices. The conduction and valence band positions are shown in the bottom and top bars, respectively, with OER and HER thermodynamic potentials represented as blue and green dashed lines, respectively. The red and blue bars are the oxidation and reduction potentials of each SC. SC will self-oxidize if the oxidation potential is below the OER potential and self-reduce if the reduction potential is above the HER potential.

Data in panel (a) adapted from ref (13). Remaining data adapted from ref (49).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe high thermodynamic driving force to oxidize the SCs has practical consequences. (14) In Figure 1b, we show that in an EC/SC system that employs nanoparticles of Ni on Si (np-Ni/n-Si, where np- stands for nanoparticle), a Si oxide layer evolves on top of Si and the regions between the Ni catalysts and the Si SC are oxidized. The evolved SiO2 insulating layers protect the Si SC from further degradation. In addition, we measured (Figure 1d) that these oxidized np-Ni/Si photoelectrocatalysts generate significantly higher photovoltages under OER conditions compared to planar films of the identical ECs (Ni) covering the same Si SC (pf-Ni/n-Si, where pf- stands for planar film), shown in Figure 1c, which does not evolve interfacial SiO2 under reaction conditions due to the interface being screened from the electrolyte. (15−18)It is important to note that, while Si can be partially protected by the growth of the SiO2 layers, many other optically attractive SCs will oxidize and degrade by evolving oxidized species into the electrolyte. It has been shown that these unstable SCs can be somewhat protected against this oxidation by the introduction of protective layers of more stable materials. For example, it has been demonstrated that fabricating stable oxide insulator layers (e.g., TiO2, Al2O3, or HfO2) at the EC/SC interface and forming metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) junctions improves the system stability. (19−22)The focus of this Viewpoint is to discuss how the physical properties and atomistic features of the oxidized EC/SC interfaces impact the performance of these systems. Specifically, we aim to highlight common misconceptions present in the literature in the evaluation of these systems and in the description of underlying physical processes that govern their performance. We also provide guidelines on how to experimentally measure the physical properties of these systems, which are critical for our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the performance. We use Ni ECs on a Si light absorber as a model case study to illustrate the interplay between the physical and chemical phenomena present in these systems. Insights obtained from this system should be generalizable to other SC systems which form surface oxides under reaction conditions. Examples include InP, (23−25) GaAs, (26) GaxIn1–xP, (27,28) and BiVO4, (14,29) which are of great interest for practical photoelectrochemical applications. However, we note that specific EC/SC combinations will require detailed characterization to determine how system-specific oxidation processes will dictate their performance. Separating Electrocatalytic Activity and PhotovoltageWhen evaluating the performance of photoelectrochemical systems executing electrocatalytic half-reactions, the key macroscopic performance metrics are electrocatalytic activity and photovoltage. In principle, electrocatalytic activity quantifies the ability of the ECs to drive electrocatalytic half-reactions, and superior ECs will drive the reaction with lower overpotentials. (30) Photovoltage is a measure of the propensity of the SC to generate an electromotive force that is imparted on the ECs. (31,32) Photovoltage is a function of the inherent properties of the SC light absorber and the quality of the EC/SC interface. One critical objective of fundamental research has been to identify EC/SC systems with photovoltage and electrocatalytic activity as high as possible.It is somewhat challenging to evaluate these two performance metrics in functioning photoelectrocatalytic systems in a typical three-electrode experimental setup used to assess the rate of reaction (i.e., current density) as a function of voltage. Improvements in both electrocatalysis and photovoltage show up as a lower overpotential required to execute the reaction at a particular rate. We also note that while measuring current density alone without quantifying reaction products does not always lead to an accurate assessment of the desired product formation rate, OER on redox-active ECs (e.g., Ni) has consistently demonstrated high Faradaic efficiencies, and the OER rate can most often be equated to the measured oxidation current. (16,33)To illustrate the difficulty in deconvoluting photovoltage from catalytic activity, the data in Figure 2a show the performance of an illuminated np-Ni/n-Si sample, containing nanoparticles of Ni on planar n-Si SC under basic (i.e., 1 M KOH) OER conditions, measured in a classical three-electrode setup. The data show improvements in the OER onset potential as a function of oxidation/reduction cycling. Similar data have also been interpreted as improvements to the photovoltage of the EC/SC systems as a function of potential cycling. (15,34,35) The improvements in the photovoltage could be due to the gradual evolution of the EC/SC interface that leads to atomistic changes in junction characteristics that affect the photovoltage. For example, the oxidation of the metal EC could change the effective barrier height of the junction under reaction conditions. (36) This improvement in onset potential, however, could also be a consequence of the reaction-conditions-induced improvements in electrocatalysis. Improvements in electrocatalysis could be due to the reaction-induced changes in the surface area of the EC or incorporation of some impurities from the electrolyte into the EC or even the evolution of new sites (perhaps at the EC/SC interface) that could lead to an increase in the measured reaction rates. (37−42)Figure 2Figure 2. (a) Current density versus voltage (J–V) plots of the illuminated np-Ni/n-Si system over 10–30 cyclic voltammetry sweeps under OER conditions in a base. (b) Nanoparticle size distributions for the np-Ni/n-Si and np-Ni/p+-Si systems shown in panels (a) and (c). (c) Current density versus voltage plots (J–V) of dark np-Ni/p+-Si system over 10–30 cyclic voltammetry sweeps under OER conditions in a base. (d) Photovoltage as a function of cyclic voltammetry sweeps for pf-Ni/n-Si, pf-Ni/SiO2/n-Si, and np-Ni/n-Si, showing that the photovoltage remains nearly constant under the reaction conditions. Data adapted from ref (49).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideOne way to deconvolute the electrocatalytic activity from the photovoltage is to perform electrochemical measurements in the dark using an EC with a form factor (i.e., size distribution, coverage, and shape of metal nanoparticles) that is approximately equal to that of the photoelectrocatalytic system of interest. Ideally, this EC should be deposited on a SC degenerately doped with the opposite charge. If inverse doping of the SC is not possible, the EC could be deposited on an inert conductive support (e.g., FTO) using identical synthesis methods. In the above case of a Ni/Si system, this can be done by depositing Ni nanoparticles on a p+-type Si (np-Ni/p+-Si) substrate which provides a steady supply of holes for water oxidation (i.e., OER). The similarity between the systems used in the dark electrocatalytic and the light-on photoelectrocatalytic measurements (shown in Figure 2b) in principle supposes that reaction-induced changes to the ECs will be identical, allowing us to isolate the changes in photovoltage. For example, the data in Figure 2a,c show examples of illuminated and dark electrocatalytic OER measurements for np-Ni/n-Si and np-Ni/p+-Si, respectively, over 30 cycles. The data show similar trends in changes in the OER onset potential for both systems under reaction conditions. This indicates that the improvements seen in the photoelectrochemical behavior of np-Ni/n-Si (Figure 2a) are mainly due to the improvements in the electrocatalytic behavior of the system (Figure 2c) and not due to the improvements in photovoltage. This is shown in Figure 2d, where photovoltages for both planar and nanoparticle Ni/n-Si systems are plotted over 30 voltage sweeps. Here, we measured the photovoltage by comparing the onset potential at 1 mA cm–2 for illuminated n-Si and dark electrochemical p+-Si samples. The data show that the photovoltage is relatively constant for all systems when averaged over multiple samples.The data in Figure 2d show that for Ni/Si systems the photovoltage generated by the system does not change over multiple oxidation and reduction cycling steps and that the changes in the current–voltage data in Figure 2a can be attributed to the changes in the rates of electrocatalytic reactions on the Ni ECs. As we have mentioned, changes in the rates of electrocatalytic reactions can be a consequence of multiple variables, including the changes in the number of catalytically active sites and the changes in the inherent catalytic activity of the active sites. In the case of OER on Ni ECs, it appears that the number of active electrocatalytic sites increases over time as a consequence of oxidation/reduction cycling. This can be seen in the data in Figure 2a,c, which show that the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH oxidation and reduction peaks (observed just prior to the onset of OER) grow in magnitude for both illuminated and dark samples. This indicates an increase in the amount of catalytically active Ni sites during OER testing under basic conditions. (37,43,44) Furthermore, the data in Figure 2a,c also show a shift in the Ni oxidation peak to the right, closer to the onset of OER, indicating that the nature of the catalytic sites is changing. The shifting oxidation peak has been attributed to incorporation of Fe from the electrolyte, which has been shown to improve Ni catalytic activity as it integrates into the oxide shell. (43,45) Overall, this type of analysis demonstrates the need for detailed assessment of electrocatalytic activity in determining the performance of EC/SC photoelectrocatalysts. Impact of EC Coverage and EC/SC Interfacial Oxide Layers on PerformanceAnother critical complexity associated with np-EC/SC photoelectrocatalysts is that small changes in the atomistic features of the EC/SC interface can impact the system photovoltage. For example, oxide layers between the EC and the SC (Figure 1b) can influence the photovoltage. (46−48) This is supported by the data in Figures 1d and 2d which show that the np-Ni/Si OER photoelectrocatalyst (np- stands for nanoparticle) generates a higher photovoltage than the pf-Ni/Si and pf-Ni/SiO2/Si systems (pf- stands for planar film). We note that in one system (pf-Ni/Si), the Ni EC and n-Si SC are in direct contact with each other, with the Ni/Si interface protected from the aqueous electrolyte by the Ni EC. In the second system (pf-Ni/SiO2/Si), we grew a thin layer of SiO2 (∼1.6 nm) between planar Ni and n-Si, and in the third (np-Ni/Si), the Ni EC is in the form of nanoparticles on planar SiO2/n-Si. In the np-Ni/Si system, the SiO2 layer is formed in a self-limiting growth process as soon as the EC/SC system is introduced to the electrolyte (i.e., the oxidation of the top layers of Si takes place upon the interaction of Si with the water electrolyte). The data show that the generated photovoltage is higher for the systems that contain an interfacial SiO2 layer and that it is highly dependent on the atomistic features of the EC/SC interface.To understand the differences in the measured photovoltages of these three systems, we can write an equation that captures the relationship between photovoltage and current for a photoelectrochemical system. This equation is essentially a variation of the illuminated diode equation: (19,20,46,49−51)|Vph|=nkTq[ln(Jph−JnetJs+1)](1)where Vph is the photovoltage, which is the electromotive force developed across the SC under illumination at a given rate (given Jnet), Jph is the photo-limiting current (i.e., the current of photogenerated minority charge carriers toward the metal ECs), Js is the reverse saturation recombination current density, n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature (assumed to be 298 K), q is the elementary charge, and Jnet is the net current (i.e., the hole current plus the electron current). Under a given illumination intensity (i.e., fixed Jph), the photovoltage can be maximized by reducing the reverse saturation current, Js. The reverse saturation current is dominated by the thermionic emission recombination mechanism at the metal EC/SC interface, given as (52)Js=A*T2fcexp(−qϕbkT)(2)where fc is the interfacial EC/SC electrocatalyst coverage, A* is the Richardson's constant, and ϕb is the barrier height of the system.The use of eq 1 allows us to determine photovoltage across different systems as a function of operating conditions and system parameters by inputting Jph, Jnet, Js, and n for a given experimental system. We set the illumination intensity to AM 1.5 G 1-sun illumination intensity in all cases, except for when light intensity is varied for the measurement of the ideality factor. We experimentally measured system photovoltages by comparing the voltage difference between light and dark samples at 1 mA/cm2 (i.e., Jnet = 1 mA/cm2) under OER conditions. We can look at each of the variables that govern the saturation current to attempt to quantify their impact on the performance of EC/SC photoelectrocatalysts.It is clear from eq 2 that Js should be impacted by the coverage of the metal EC nanoparticles on the SC (more specifically the EC/SC contact area). The main reason for this is that the EC/SC contact area provides a path for the majority charge carriers to reach the EC and recombine with the minority charge carriers, thus leading to parasitic loss. (53) If this contact area for recombination is smaller, and all other variables are kept constant (we assume that Jph is not affected by the EC/SC contact area due to negligible changes in the degree of parasitic light absorption among different samples), the recombination current will decrease. (54) For the case of Ni on Si, using a combination of top-down (SEM) and cross-sectional (STEM) imaging, we showed that the Ni nanoparticles assemble on n-Si in a spherical shape, with Ni/Si having a contact area that is ∼50% of the top-down geometrically projected area of the Ni nanoparticle. We note that the ratio of the top-down projected and the interfacial contact areas is ultimately affected by the degree of wetting between the EC and SC, which is in turn governed by the adhesion energy between them and the surface energies of the EC. (55) For the case of the Ni/Si system, we showed that the photovoltage increases by ∼110 mV when the EC coverage decreases from a planar film (fc = 1) to Ni nanoparticles (fc = 0.11, corresponding to geometrically projected SEM coverage = 0.21) when all other variables are kept constant. While this contribution is significant, it does not account for the total photovoltage difference between np-Ni/n-Si and planar Ni/n-Si photoelectrocatalysts observed experimentally.As we described above, another feature of the illuminated np-Ni/n-Si is that an interfacial layer of SiO2 develops between the EC and SC due to the tendency of Si to oxidize under reaction conditions. These interfacial oxide layers (shown in Figure 3a), which are often insulating in nature, can significantly impact the photovoltage of the illuminated EC/SC photoelectrocatalysts since they modulate the flux of energetic electrons and holes from the SC to EC, and therefore the recombination currents. (19) Therefore, the mathematical expression for Js (eq 2 above) needs to be modified to include the impact of the interfacial oxide layer on the flux of charge carriers. For example, if the majority charge carriers need to tunnel through an insulator, the tunneling probability through the interfacial oxide layer needs to be included in the expression for the reverse saturation current: (56)Js=fcA*T2exp(−qϕbkT)Tt(3)Tt=exp(−αdϕe)(4)where Tt is the tunneling probability, ϕe is the potential barrier height for tunneling of the majority charge carriers from SC to EC, d is the insulator thickness, and α is a constant and is assumed to be unity (in Å–1/eV–1/2 units) in many cases. (20,47,57,58) The tunneling probability term describes the likelihood that an electron will tunnel through an oxide of thickness d and recombine with holes at the metal EC site, as illustrated in the band diagram in Figure 3b. The tunneling probability for a specific system can be measured independently or approximated based on the electronic structure of the SC and the insulating oxide. (50)Figure 3Figure 3. (a) High-resolution TEM cross section of the np-Ni/Si interface. (b) Illustration of the energy band diagram and the movement of charge carriers for a metal EC/insulator/SC interface in equilibrium with relevant physical parameters. Here, Esol is the solution Fermi level, Em is the metal EC Fermi level, Es is the SC Fermi level, ECB is the conduction band energy level, EVB is the valence band energy level, ϕb is the barrier height, ϕe is the potential barrier height for electrons, d is the thickness of the insulator, Vn is the difference between the SC Fermi level and the conduction band edge, Vfb is the flat band potential, Je is the electron current density, and Js is the reverse saturation current density. (c) Measured photovoltage as a function of the insulator thickness for pf-Ir/HfO2/n-Si and pf-Ni/HfO2/n-Si systems, with data adapted from refs (13) and (24).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideBased on the analysis above, it is evident that the thickness of the evolved interfacial oxide (d) at the np-EC/SC interface will have a strong impact on the performance, as it will directly affect the tunneling probability (Tt). We have demonstrated this relationship between the insulating layer thickness and performance in multiple contributions (see Figure 3c). (19,20,50) In general, we found, as shown in Figure 3c, that the photovoltage generated by EC/SC photoelectrocatalysts exhibits a volcano behavior with respect to the thickness of the insulator between the EC and SC. The observed volcano behavior is a consequence of the fact that, in the limit of overly thick insulators, the performance is limited by the inability of photogenerated minority charge carriers to reach the EC and execute the desired reactions. On the other hand, a very thin oxide layer is not able to impose a significant tunneling barrier for the majority charge carriers, resulting in large recombination losses. The specific value of the insulator thickness that maximizes photovoltage ultimately depends on the inherent properties of the EC and SC junctions and the insulator layer. (19) In the specific case of planar Ni or Ir ECs on Si, the optimal thickness of the protective HfO2 layer was found to be ∼2 nm. We note that the photovoltage generated in the absence of HfO2 is higher for the Ir system compared to the Ni system due to the difference in the electric work functions of the two materials (i.e., Ir has a higher work function and therefore leads to a higher as-fabricated direct metal EC/SC barrier height). Impact of Non-idealities on the Barrier Height of SystemsAs we have described in the previous section, the interfacial oxide layers will impact the flux of charge carriers from the SC to the EC and therefore the overall photovoltage. In addition, the interfacial oxide layers can also impact the overall Schottky barrier height (ϕb) of the system by, for example, changing the work function of the EC due to a change in its oxidation state under reaction conditions. (36) Also, defects and trap sites can evolve at the interface of these oxides with the SC and EC or within the oxide. (56,59) These states could add a level of complexity since they serve as recombination centers, which can lead to an electrical potential drop across the oxide layers. The presence of these defects leads to complex relationships between the ideality factor (n) and the Schottky barrier height (ϕb) (see eqs 1 and 2 for the description of these variables).Generally, an ideal system will have n = 1, while non-idealities will increase n to values greater than 1. There are often misconceptions in the literature related to the physical meaning and experimental evaluation of the barrier height and its relation to the ideality factor. In general, these misconceptions seem to be related to the way barrier height and ideality factor are measured in these systems. The barrier height for planar EC/SC systems is generally measured experimentally using the Mott–Schottky method. Specifically, the Mott–Schottky method uses electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over a wide range of applied potentials in a solution with a kinetically facile redox couple (e.g., ferri-/ferrocyanide (Fe(CN)63–/4–)) to measure the flat band potential (Vfb), which is then used to calculate the barrier height. This method extracts the barrier height in the form of what is known as the flat-band barrier height, which assumes an ideal case of n = 1. Physically, this flat-band condition refers to the situation when there is no electric field in the SC and the band energies of the SC at the interface are flat. Therefore, the non-idealities present at the interface (e.g., in the form of defects) will not be charged under flat-band conditions and will not contribute to the barrier height measured with the Mott–Schottky method. Consequently, the Mott–Schottky method measures the ideal barrier height (ϕb,ideal) with n = 1. This barrier height (ϕb,ideal) will always present an upper bound to the actual barrier height of the system (ϕb). ϕb is defined as the barrier height of the system at equilibrium when there is no applied voltage (i.e., zero bias). Under these conditions non-idealities will influence the system, and it is necessary to evaluate the ideality factor n to measure ϕb. If the ideality factor n is larger than 1, the barrier height ϕb will be lower than ϕb,ideal. Unfortunately, one can find mistaken assertions in the EC/SC photoelectrocatalytic literature suggesting that non-idealities at the interface (n > 1) can lead to higher barrier heights relative to the situations with no non-idealities (n = 1) and that these non-idealities improve the performance of systems.One approach to find ϕb is to measure n and ϕb,ideal and use these two variables to compute the barrier height. We can experimentally measure n by using the following equation to fit the open-circuit photovoltage to light intensity: (22,35,60)VOC≈nkTqln(Jph)−nkTqln(Js)(5)where VOC is the open-circuit photovoltage. Based on this equation, varying the light intensity (i.e., varying the Jph) will lead to changes in the measured VOC. As a result, the plot of VOC versus ln(Jph) under varying light intensity conditions will yield a straight line with a slope that can be used to evaluate n and an intercept that can be used to evaluate Js. This analysis using eq 5 assumes that Js is independent of changes in the light intensity and the condition Jph/Js ≫ 1 holds. These assumptions generally hold for the systems discussed here. The measured ideality factor (n) and ideal barrier height (ϕb,ideal) values (obtained using the Mott–Schottky method) can be used to determine the actual barrier height (ϕb) of the system under the reaction conditions using the following equation: (61)ϕb=ϕb,idealn+(n−1n)Vn(6)where Vn is the difference between the SC Fermi level and the conduction band edge, as illustrated in Figure 3b. Vn can be calculated using the following equation:Vn=kTqlnNCND(7)where NC is the effective density of states in the conduction band of the SC (this is an inherent property of the SC material) and ND is the doping density. ND is experimentally determined from the Mott–Schottky plot. (62)Data in Figure 4a show the actual barrier heights compared to the ideal barriers measured as described above for pf-Ni/n-Si and pf-Ni/SiO2/n-Si systems. The data show that the SiO2 interfacial layer lowers the actual barrier height, most likely due to the formation of defects and trap sites (i.e., non-idealities) at the additional interfaces introduced by the oxide layers.
