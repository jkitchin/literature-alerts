Single phase Mn rich Mn1-x RuxO2 conforming a highly disordered γ MnO2 with pyrolusite-like blocks dominating in the structure were prepared for low Ru content (0.15 ≥ x ≥ 0.30). All synthesized materials were electrochemically active in oxygen and chlorine evolution reactions in acidic conditions while varying the content of chlorides. The total activity increased with increasing Ru content in the structure as well as increasing concentration of chlorides in the solution. The selectivity towards oxygen evolution reaction was predominant for all chloride concentrations (from 0.02 to 0.3M), and its value was not dependent on the total Ru content in the material structure. The reaction mechanism with respect to chlorine evolution reaction was discussed on the basis of the determined order of reactions, which apparently increased with increasing Ru content.

Improving the kinetics of oxygen evolution is crucial for enhancing the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, this study utilizes a chemical self-growth method to grow NiFe tannic acid complex (NFTA) and Co(OH)2 on the surface of BiVO4 photoanode (BiVO4/NFTA/Co). As a result, the synergistic effects of NFTA and Co(OH)2 layers promote the efficiency and stability of BiVO4 photoanode towards PEC water oxidation. The photocurrent density of the obtained BiVO4/NFTA/Co photoanode reaches 4.97 mA cm-2, which is significantly greater than those of BiVO4/NFTA (4.36 mA cm-2), BiVO4/Co (2.51 mA cm-2), BiVO4 (1.34 mA cm-2), respectively. Detailed analysis confirms that NFTA could provide an efficient way to hasten the transfer of photo-generated holes on the photoanode surface and diminish the surface charge transfer resistance. In other hand, Co(OH)2 could be served as a cocatalyst to accelerate charge transfer for efficient oxygen evolution reaction as well as a protective layer to maintain the long-term stability of NFTA on the surface of BiVO4 during water oxidation. Such double oxygen evolution co-catalysts decoration strategy paves an effective pathway to enhance the PEC water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanode.

Abstract Transition metal silicates (TMSs) are attempted for the electrocatalyst of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their special layered structure in recent years. However, defects such as low theoretical activity and conductivity limit their application. Researchers always prefer to composite TMSs with other functional materials to make up for their deficiency, but rarely focus on the effect of intrinsic structure adjustment on their catalytic activity, especially anion structure regulation. Herein, applying the method of interference hydrolysis and vacancy reserve, new silicate vacancies (anionic regulation) are introduced in cobalt silicate hydroxide (CoSi), named SV‐CoSi, to enlarge the number and enhance the activity of catalytic sites. The overpotential of SV‐CoSi declines to 301 mV at 10 mA cm −2 compared to 438 mV of CoSi. Source of such improvement is verified to be not only the increase of active sites, but also the positive effect on the intrinsic activity due to the enhancement of cobalt‐oxygen covalence with the variation of anion structure by density functional theory (DFT) method. This work demonstrates that the feasible intrinsic anion structure regulation can improve OER performance of TMSs and provides an effective idea for the development of non‐noble metal catalyst for OER.

A significant challenge in direct seawater electrolysis is the rapid deactivation of the cathode due to the large scaling of Mg(OH)2. Herein, we synthesized a Pt-coated highly disordered NiCu alloy (Pt-NiCu alloy) electrode with superior solidophobic behavior, enabling stable hydrogen generation (100 mA cm–2, >1000 h durability) and simultaneous production of Mg(OH)2 (>99.0% purity) in electrolyte enriched with Mg2+ and Ca2+. The unconventional solidophobic property primarily stems from the high surface energy of the NiCu alloy substrate, which facilitates the adsorption of surface water and thereby compels the bulk formation of Mg(OH)2 via homogeneous nucleation. The discovery of this solidophobic electrode will revolutionarily simplify the existing techniques for seawater electrolysis and increase the economic viability for seawater electrolysis.

The development of affordable, highly active, and stable trifunctional electrocatalysts is imperative for sustainable energy applications such as overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn–air battery. Herein, we report a composite electrocatalyst with RuSe2 and CoSe2 hybrid nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (RuSe2CoSe2/NC) synthesized through a carbonization–adsorption–selenylation strategy. This electrocatalyst is a trifunctional electrocatalyst with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. An in-depth study of the effect of Se on the electrocatalytic process was conducted. Notably, the incorporation of Se moderately adjusted electronic structure of Ru and Co, enhancing all three types of catalytic performance (HER, η10 = 31 mV; OER, η10 = 248 mV; ORR, E1/2 = 0.834 V) under alkaline condition with accelerated kinetics and improved stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the (210) crystal facet of RuSe2 is the dominant HER active site as it exhibited the lowest ΔGH* value. The in situ Raman spectra unravel the evolution process of the local electronic environment of Co–Se and Ru–Se bonds, which synergistically promotes the formation of CoOOH as the active intermediate during the OER. The superior catalytic efficiency and remarkable durability of RuSe2CoSe2/NC as an electrode for water splitting and zinc–air battery devices demonstrate its great potential for energy storage and conversion devices.

PEMWE is considered a promising technology for coupling with renewable energy sources to achieve clean hydrogen production. However, constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic OER and the acidic abominable environment render the grand challenges in developing the active and stable OER electrocatalyst, leading to low efficiency of PEMWE. Herein, we develop the rutile‐type IrO2 nanoparticles with abundant grain boundaries and the continuous nanostructure through the joule heating and sacrificial template method. DFT calculations verified that grain boundaries can modulate the electronic structure of Ir sites and optimize the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, resulting in the accelerated kinetics. The 350‐IrO2 affords a rapid OER process with 20 times higher mass activity (0.61 A mgIr‐1) than the commercial IrO2 at 1.50 V vs. RHE. Benefiting from the reduced overpotential and the preservation of the stable rutile structure, 350‐IrO2 exhibits the stability of 200 h test at 10 mA cm‐2 with only trace decay of 11.8 mV. Moreover, the assembled PEMWE with anode 350‐IrO2 catalyst outputs the current density up to 2 A cm‐2 with only 1.84 V applied voltage, long‐term operation for 100 h without obvious performance degradation at 1 A cm‐2.

Abstract The exploitation of highly activity oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is critical for the application of electrocatalytic water splitting. Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is expected to provide a promising pathway to overcome the sluggish OER kinetics, however, effectively enhancing the involvement of lattice oxygen remains challenging. In this study, the fabrication of B, Fe co‐doped CoP (B, Fe─CoP) nanofibers is reported, which serve as highly efficient OER electrocatalyst through phosphorization and boronation treatment of Fe‐doped Co 3 O 4 nanofibers. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations reveal that simultaneous incorporation of both B and Fe can more effectively trigger the participation of lattice oxygen in CoFe oxyhydroxides reconstructed from B, Fe─CoP nanofibers compared to incorporating only B or Fe. Therefore, the optimized B, Fe─CoP nanofibers exhibit superb OER activity with low overpotentials of 361 and 376 mV at 1000 mA cm −2 in alkaline freshwater and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The present work provides significant guidelines and innovative design concepts for the development of OER electrocatalysts following the LOM pathway.

Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) has emerged as a kind of multi‐functional green oxidants with extensive industrial utility. Oxidized carbon materials exhibit promises as electrocatalysts in the two‐electron (2e − ) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for H 2 O 2 production. However, the precise identification and fabrication of active sites that selectively yield H 2 O 2 present a serious challenge. Herein, a structural engineering strategy is employed to synthesize oxygen‐doped carbon quantum dots (o‐CQD) for the 2e − ORR. The surface electronic structure of the o‐CQDs is systematically modulated by varying isomerization precursors, thereby demonstrating excellent electrocatalyst performance. Notably, o‐CQD‐3 emerges as the most promising candidate, showcasing a remarkable H 2 O 2 selectivity of 96.2% (n = 2.07) at 0.68 V versus RHE, coupled with a low Tafel diagram of 66.95 mV dec −1 . In the flow cell configuration, o‐CQD‐3 achieves a H 2 O 2 productivity of 338.7 mmol g catalyst −1 h −1 , maintaining consistent production stability over an impressive 120‐hour duration. Utilizing in situ technology and density functional theory calculations, it is unveil that edge sites of o‐CQD‐3 are facilely functionalized by C‐O‐C groups under alkaline ORR conditions. This isomerization engineering approach advances the forefront of sustainable catalysis and provides a profound insight into the carbon‐based catalyst design for environmental‐friendly chemical synthesis processes.

Climate change is showing its impacts now more than ever. The intense use of fossil fuels and the resulting CO 2 emissions are mainly to blame, accentuating the need to develop further the available energy conversion and storage technologies, which are regarded as effective solutions to maximize the use of intermittent renewable energy sources and reduce global CO 2 emissions. This work comprehensively overviews the most recent progress and trends in the use of transition metal-based electrocatalysts for three crucial reactions in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, namely, the oxygen evolution (OER), oxygen reduction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. By analyzing the state-of-the-art polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the performance of these two promising types of materials for OER, ORR, and HER is compared to that of more traditional transition metal oxides and alloy-based electrocatalysts. Both catalytic activity and stability are highly influenced by the adsorption energies of the intermediate species formed in each reaction, which are very sensitive to changes in the microstructure and chemical microenvironment. POMs and MOFs allow these aspects to be easily modified to fine-tune the catalytic performances. Therefore, their chemical tunability and versatility make it possible to tailor such properties to obtain higher electrocatalytic activities, or even to obtain derived materials with more compelling properties towards these reactions.

The phenomenon of friction increase in graphene coatings during prolonged treatment in an oxygen plasma environment has been widely recognized. In this study, we report a newly discovered oxidation state that leads to decreased friction during oxygen plasma treatment of vacancy graphene and propose a simple, clean, and efficient method for the controlled oxidation. Through density-functional theory calculations, we suggest the possibility of evolution from vacancies to oligo-oxygen and poly-oxygen structures during the oxygen plasma treatment, confirming sequential friction decrease and increase. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the oligo-oxygen structure exhibits excellent in-plane stiffness in addition to low surface friction, making it an ideal friction interface. Notably, conditional friction can induce the reverse evolution of the poly-oxygen structures back to the oligo-oxygen structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the friction of oligo-oxygen and poly-oxygen structures decreased by 30.6% and increased by 130.1%, respectively, compared to the initial graphene vacancy structures. Moreover, the induced friction by 0.1 N in the presence of hydrogen makes the friction performance of the induced poly-oxygen structures, especially in the initial friction phase, almost comparable to that of the oligo-oxygen structures. These findings reveal the structural evolution and reverse evolution laws of graphene coatings in high-energy oxygen plasma environments, which are of great significance for the lubrication of moving component devices in the oxygen plasma environment, including in the plasma industry and space.

The Ir-based electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have demonstrated remarkable durability. Enhancing the Ir-based electrocatalytic activity still remains crucial owing to the scarcity of iridium. Here, a high-temperature sintering technique is employed to fabricate a boron (B)-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 coating with an almost perfect rutile-type crystal structure on a corrosion-resistant titanium substrate, ensuring exceptional stability for the acidic OER. The B-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode fabricated in a mixed solution of 0.6 M H3BO3, exhibits an overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a lower Tafel slope of 34.2 mV dec−1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is far lower than the 272 mV overpotential and the 45.3 mV dec−1 of the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrode. The electrode possesses a minimal potential increase even after undergoing continuous OER for 400 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The incorporation of B species into IrO2-Ta2O5 effectively fine-tunes the electronic structure of Ir active sites, leading to a substantial enhancement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. This study provides promising prospects for reducing the energy consumption of noble IrO2-based electrocatalysts in the practical application of electrochemical industry for the acidic OER.

Abstract Hematite is a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical water‐splitting technology. However, the low current density associated with the low conductivity, low charge carrier mobility, and poor oxygen evolution catalytic activity is a challenging issue for the material. In this study, the challenge is addressed by introducing Germanium (Ge) doping, coupled with the use of FeCoNi‐B i as a co‐catalyst. Ge doping not only increases the conductivity and charge carrier concentration of the hematite photoanode, but also induces nanopores, thereby expanding its electrochemical reactive surface area to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction. In the meantime, the FeCoNi‐B i cocatalyst electrodeposited onto the surface of Ge‐doped hematite, improves the oxygen evolution reaction performance. As a result, the obtained photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 2.31 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V RHE , which is three times higher than that of hematite (0.72 mA cm −2 ). Moreover, a new analytical method is introduced to scrutinize both the positive and negative effects of Ge doping and FeCoNi‐B i cocatalyst on the photoanode performance by decoupling the photoelectrochemical process steps. Overall, this study not only enhances the performance of hematite photoanodes but also guides their rational design and systematic assessment.

Abstract The energy and environmental crisis pose a great challenge to human development in the 21st century. The design and development of clean and renewable energy and the solution for environmental pollution have become a hotspot in the current research. Based on the preparation of transition metal phosphates, transition metals were used as raw materials, Prussian blue-like NiFe(CN) 6 as a precursor, which was in situ grown on nickel foam (NF) substrate. After low temperature phosphating treatment, a bimetallic phosphide electrocatalyst (NiFe) 2 P/NF was prepared on NF substrate. Using 1 mol·L −1 KOH solution as a basic electrolyte, based on the electrochemical workstation of a three-electrode system, the electrochemical catalytic oxygen evolution performance of the material was tested and evaluated. Experiments show that (NiFe) 2 P/NF catalyst has excellent oxygen evolution performance. In an alkaline medium, the overpotential required to obtain the catalytic current density of 10 mA·cm −2 is only 220 mV, and the Tafel slope is 67 mV·dec −1 . This is largely due to: (1) (NiFe)2p/NF nanocatalysts were well dispersed on NF substrates, which increased the number of active sites exposed; (2) the hollow heterostructure of bimetallic phosphates promotes the electron interaction between (NiFe) 2 P and NF, increased the rate of charge transfer, and the electrical conductivity of the material is improved; and (3) theoretical calculations show that (NiFe) 2 P/NF hollow heterostructure can effectively reduce the dissociation barrier of water, promote the dissociation of water; furthermore, the kinetic reaction rate of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution is accelerated. Meanwhile, the catalyst still has high activity and high stability in 30 wt% concentrated alkali solution. Therefore, the construction of (NiFe) 2 P/NF electrocatalysts enriches the application of non-noble metal nanomaterials in the field of oxygen production from electrolytic water.

Electrocatalytic water splitting provides a sustainable method for storing intermittent energies, such as solar energy and wind, in the form of hydrogen fuel. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), constituting the other half-cell reaction, is often considered the bottleneck in overall water splitting due to its slow kinetics. Therefore, it is crucial to develop efficient, cost-effective, and robust OER catalysts to enhance the water-splitting process. Transition-metal-based coordination polymers (CPs) serve as promising electrocatalysts due to their diverse chemical architectures paired with redox-active metal centers. Despite their potential, the rational use of CPs has faced obstacles including a lack of insights into their catalytic mechanisms, low conductivity, and morphology issues. Consequently, achieving success in this field requires the rational design of ligands and topological networks with the desired electronic structure. This study delves into the design and synthesis of three novel conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs) by leveraging the full conjugation of terpyridine-attached flexible tetraphenylethylene units as electron-rich linkers with various redox-active metal centers [Co(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)]. The self-assembly process is tuned for each CCP, resulting in two distinct morphologies: nanosheets and nanorings. The electrocatalytic OER performance efficiency is then correlated with factors such as the nanostructure morphology and redox-active metal centers in alkaline electrolytes. Notably, among the three morphologies studied, nanorings for each CCP exhibit a superior OER activity. Co(II)-integrated CCPs demonstrate a higher activity between the redox-active metal centers. Specifically, the Co(II) nanoring morphology displays exceptional catalytic activity for OER, with a lower overpotential of 347 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm

Abstract Metal-organic cobalt hydroxide emerges as a cost-effective electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in energy conversion. However, the limited active sites and poor conductivity hinder their large-scale application. This study employed salicylate as a bridging ligand to synthesize iron-incorporated metal-organic cobalt hydroxide. The influence of Fe intercalation on Co(OH)(Hsal) (where Hsal denotes o -HOC 6 H 4 COO − ) was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fe 0.2 Co 0.8 (OH)(Hsal) demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic activity, displaying an OER overpotential of 298 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 57.46 mV dec −1 . This enhancement can be attributed to improved charge transfer kinetics and increased active sites. This work highlights the crucial role of Fe in improving the efficiency of Co-based oxygen-evolving catalysts (OECs) and its potential for boosting efficient hydrogen generation in alkaline environments.

Abstract Practical applications of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rely on the development of highly efficient, stable, and low‐cost catalysts. Tuning the electronic structure, morphology, and architecture of catalysts is an important way to realize efficient and stable HER electrocatalysts. Herein, Co‐doped Cu 3 P‐based sugar‐gourd structures (Co─Cu 3 P/CF) are prepared on copper foam as active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. This hierarchical structure facilitates fast mass transport during electrocatalysis. Notably, the introduction of Co not only induces a charge redistribution but also leads to lattice‐mismatch on the atomic scale, which creates defects and performs as additional active sites. Therefore, Co─Cu 3 P/CF requires an overpotential of only 81, 111, 185, and 230 mV to reach currents of 50, 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm −2 in alkaline media and remains stable after 10 000 CV cycles in a row and up to 110 h i–t stability tests. In addition, it also shows excellent HER performance in water/seawater electrolytes of different pH values. Experimental and DFT show that the introduction of Co modulates the electronic and energy level structures of the catalyst, optimizes the adsorption and desorption behavior of the intermediate, reduces the water dissociation energy barrier during the reaction, accelerates the Volmer step reaction, and thus improves the HER performance.

Developing the ecofriendly and high-fidelity electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to foster effective production of environmentally friendly hydrogen. Herein, we fabricated the highly efficient OER electrocatalysts of the activated carbon-decorated vanadium pentoxide (AC-V2O5) nanocomposites using a facile hydrothermal technique. The AC-V2O5 nanocomposites displayed an aggregated structure of the AC nano-sheet-anchored orthorhombic V2O5 nanorods. When performing the OER process in an alkaline electrolyte at 10 mA/cm2, AC-V2O5 exhibited the low overpotential (~230 mV), small Tafel slope (~54 mV/dec), and excellent stability. These substantial OER performances of AC-V2O5 could be ascribed to the synergistic effects from both the electrochemically active V2O5 nanorods and the highly conductive AC nanosheets. The results infer that the AC-V2O5 nanocomposites possess a substantial aptitude as a high-performance OER electrocatalyst for production of the future green energy source—hydrogen.

Notably, selenization by strong reducibility triggered the generation of abundant Co3+ active sites and heterogeneous structures, as well as improved electrical conductivity. The Co0·9Mo0.1-Se/Cu7Se4 electrocatalyst showed excellent OER activity, requiring only 202 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and the Tafel slope was only 78.91 mV dec−1. Overpotential of the catalyst did not change significantly during the 38 h stability test, indicating that the electrocatalyst had excellent long-term stability. Moreover, when Co0·9Mo0.1-Se/Cu7Se4 was used as the UOR electrode, the heterojunction required 1.29 V at 10 mA cm−2. The cost-effective bifunctional metal selenide heterojunctions introduced in this study provide a research strategy for the prepared green electrode materials for hydrogen production.

Magnetic field mediated magnetic catalysts provide a powerful pathway for accelerating their sluggish kinetics toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but remain great challenges in acidic media. The key obstacle comes from the production of an ordered magnetic domain catalyst in the harsh acidic OER. In this work, we form an induced local magnetic moment in the metallic Ir catalyst via the significant 3d–5d hybridization by introducing cobalt dopants. Interestingly, CoIr nanoclusters (NCs) exhibit an excellent magnetic field enhanced acidic OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and s long-term stability of 120 h under a constant magnetic field (vs 260 mV/20 h without a magnetic field). The turnover frequency reaches 7.4 s–1 at 1.5 V (vs RHE), which is 3.0 times higher than that without magnetization. Density functional theory results show that CoIr NCs have a pronounced spin polarization intensity, which is preferable for OER enhancement.

Water electrolysis plays a central role in the transition to a fossil‐free society, but there are significant challenges to overcome in order to increase its availability on a large scale. Alkaline water electrolysis is a mature and scalable technology, although it has several disadvantages compared to electrolyzers working in acidic environments. In particular, the use of highly alkaline aqueous electrolytes can lead to corrosion, and the achieved current densities are relatively low. This study addresses the latter limitation by introducing a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setup as a novel development tool that bridges the gap between research and practical applications in commercial devices such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. A high surface area Ni foam catalyst that can sustain exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current densities of up to 4 A cm −2 in a quasi‐steady‐state within our GDE setup operating in an alkaline environment is presented. The high performance of this Ni‐based benchmark catalyst is attributed to its deposition onto a mesh‐like porous transport layer (PTL) via hydrogen‐templated electrodeposition. This forms a porous foam‐like structure that augments the mass transport of the gaseous reactants at the GDE.

The stability of supported Ir-based catalysts in acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a pressing challenge, which hinders the commercial viability of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology. Herein, we propose a cerium doping strategy to enhance the stability of supported Ir-based catalyst toward OER. The Ce-doped supported catalysts, designated as Ce-IrOx/TiN, were synthesized using an organic colloidal method. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals highly dispersed IrOx nanoparticles averaging 1.5 nm on the TiN support. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) investigations further elucidate that Ce doping effectively stabilizes the Ir species predominantly in states below 4+, crucial for modulating the surface electronic structure and thereby improving both the activity and stability of the catalysts. Electrochemical characterization highlights the superior performance of the optimized catalyst, 6%-Ce-IrOx/TiN, with an impressively low overpotential of 242 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 57.5 mV dec−1, showcasing its significance in facilitating OER. Moreover, its mass activity surpasses that of commercial IrO2 by 5.1 times at 1.7 V. Prolonged constant current testing further demonstrates the exceptional stability of the catalyst, affirming the critical role of Ce doping as a pivotal strategy for enhancing the stability of supported Ir-based catalysts and advancing the prospects for robust OER performance in PEMWE systems.

Modulating the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst plays a vital role in boosting the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we introduced a one-step solvothermal method to fabricate 1,1-ferrocene dicarboxylic acid (FcDA)-decorated self-evolved nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) nanosheet arrays on a nickel foam (NF) framework (denoted as FcDA-Ni3S2/NF). Benefiting from the interconnected ultrathin nanosheet architecture, ligand dopants induced and facilitated in situ structural reconstruction, and the FcDA-decorated Ni3S2 (FcDA-Ni3S2/NF) outperformed its singly doped and undoped counterparts in terms of OER activity. The optimized FcDA-Ni3S2/NF self-supported electrode presents a remarkably low overpotential of 268 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm–2 for the OER and demonstrates robust electrochemical stability for 48 h in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. More importantly, in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveals the generation of catalytically active oxyhydroxide species (NiOOH) derived from the surface construction during the OER of pristine FcDA-Ni3S2/NF, contributing significantly to its superior electrocatalytic performance. This study concerns the modulation of electronic structure through ligand engineering and may provide profound insight into the design of cost-efficient OER electrocatalysts.

Electronic structure tuning in metal oxides is a facile and effective strategy on boosting their catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Here, we demonstrate the electronic structure tuning of CuCo2O4 by phosphorus (P) doping via in-situ diffusion method. The results found that due to more electrons transferred from P to the neighboring Co3+, the tuned Co was served as OER active sites, which contributes to an extraordinary OER performance. The synthesized P3.85-CCO/NF exhibits an overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and a Tafel slope of 27 mV dec-1, which performs an enhanced OER activity than that of IrO2/NF. Moreover, the P3.85-CCO/NF presents stable electrochemical performances upon long-time running for 30 h. Thus, the electronic structure tuning strategy by in-situ P diffusion method emerges as an effective approach on enhancing the catalytic OER performance for metal oxide electrocatalysts.

The reaction rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important factor restricting its application. In this work, we have systematic explorated of N, O coordination number on the catalytic performance for ORR and OER. Firstly, a variety of stability analysis methods show that most of the catalysts have excellent stability. Secondly, a series of excellent bifunctional catalysts are screened by volcanic maps, ORR overpotential (ηORR), OER overpotential (ηOER), and bifunctional index (BI), such as, RhN3O1-1 (ηORR = 0.28 V, ηOER = 0.34 V, BI = 0.62 V) and CoN3O1-1 (ηORR = 0.33 V, ηOER = 0.37 V, BI = 0.70 V). In particular, RhN3O1-1 has the smallest BI value, indicating that it has the best bifunctional catalytic activity. This study offers insights into how the coordination environment affects the activity of OER/ORR.

The combination of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can significantly improve their electrochemical performance. However, in most cases, chemical pre-treatment of MWCNTs is inevitable, which may compromise the ideal performance of the final composites. Herein, via a noncovalent functionalization method, PMo12@ZIF-67 was in situ grown on the surfaces of MWCNTs with the assistance of a new dispersant containing two triethylenetetramine (TETA) segments. In order to enhance the coordination of Co metal ions with the surface of MWCNTs, phenolic hydroxyl groups were incorporated into the dispersant through reaction with gallic acid (GA). After annealing, homogeneous CNT/Co6Mo6C2/Co composites were obtained, and they showed excellent performance on oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At a current density of 10 mA cm-2, the lowest overpotential is 263 mV, of which the performance is superior to that achieved by other in situ growth methods. The uniform distribution of coordination sites and subsequent in situ growth of MOFs on MWCNTs improved the electrical conductivity of the derivatives, thereby enhanced the utilization of catalytic active sites. This study presents a novel approach for synthesizing carbon-doped electrocatalytic materials, which demonstrates significant potential in various electrochemical applications.

The main obstacle for the electrocatalytic production of "green hydrogen" is finding suitable electrocatalysts which operate highly efficiently over extended periods of time. The topic of this study is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), one of the half-reactions of water splitting. It is complex and has intricate kinetics, which impairs the reaction efficiency. Transition metal oxides have shown potential as electrocatalysts for this reaction, but much remains unknown about the atomic scale processes. We have investigated structure-composition-reactivity correlations for Co

Commercial oxygen-free copper sheets were cold-rolled with reduction rates ranging from 20% to 87% and annealed at 400, 500 and 600 °C. The microstructure and texture evolution during the cold-rolling and annealing processes were studied using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD). The results show that the deformation textures of {123}<634> (S), {112}<111> (Copper) and {110}<112> (Brass) were continuously enhanced with the increase in cold-rolling reduction. The orientations along the α-oriented fiber converged towards Brass, and the orientation density of β fiber obviously increased when the rolling reduction exceeded 60%. The recrystallization texture was significantly affected by the cold-rolling reduction. After 60% cold-rolling reduction, Copper and S texture components gradually decreased, and the {011}<511> recrystallization texture component formed with the increase in annealing temperature. After 87% cold-rolling reduction, a strong Cube texture formed, and other textures were inhibited with the increase in annealing temperature. The strong Brass and S deformation texture was conducive to the formation of a strong Cube annealing texture. The density of the annealing twin boundary decreased with the increase in annealing temperature, and more annealing twin boundaries formed in the oxygen-free copper sheets with the increase in cold-rolling reduction.

Abstract Improving the catalytic activity and durability of platinum‐based alloy catalysts remains a formidable challenge in the context of renewable energy electrolysis applications. Herein, a facile and rapid photochemical deposition strategy for the synthesis of gold single atoms (Au SAs) anchored on N‐doped carbon is presented. These Au SAs serve as a charge redistribution support for Pt–Ni alloy nanoparticles (PtNi NPs /Au SA ‐NDC), creating an extended electron‐donating interface with Pt–Ni alloy sites. Consequently, the PtNi NPs /Au SA ‐NDC hybrid catalyst manifests exceptional catalytic performance and durability in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions. Specifically, in ORR, it exhibits a half‐wave potential (0.92 V vs RHE), with a mass activity 20.4 times superior to Pt/C at 0.9 V. In HER, PtNi NPs /Au SA ‐NDC demonstrates a notably reduced overpotential of 19.1 mV vs RHE at 10 mA cm −2 and a mass activity 38 times higher than Pt/C (at 0.25 mV). Furthermore, this hybrid catalyst displays outstanding durability, with only an 8.0 mV decay observed for ORR and a 6.9 mV decay for HER after 10 000 cycles. Theoretical calculations provide insight into the mechanism, demonstrating that isolated Au sites effectively modulate the electronic structure of Pt–Ni alloy sites, facilitating intermediate adsorption and enhancing reaction kinetics.

The lack of efficient and non-precious metal catalysts poses a challenge for electrochemical water splitting in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Here, we report on the preparation of growing Ni(OH)2 nanosheets in situ on a Ni and graphene hybrid using supergravity electrodeposition and the hydrothermal method. The obtained catalyst displays outstanding performance with small overpotentials of 161.7 and 41 mV to acquire current densities of 100 and 10 mA cm−2 on hydrogen evolution reaction, overpotentials of 407 and 331 mV to afford 100 and 50 mA cm−2 on oxygen evolution reaction, and 10 mA·cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.43 V for water splitting in 1 M KOH. The electrochemical activity of the catalyst is higher than most of the earth-abundant materials reported to date, which is mainly due to its special hierarchical structure, large surface area, and good electrical conductivity. This study provides new tactics for enhancing the catalytic performance of water electrolysis.

Abstract Although zinc‒air batteries (ZABs) are regarded as one of the most prospective energy storage devices, their practical application has been restricted by poor air electrode performance. Herein, we developed a free‐standing air electrode that is fabricated on the basis of a multifunctional three‐dimensional interconnected graphene network. Specifically, a three‐dimensional interconnected graphene network with fast mass and electron transport ability, prepared by catalyzing growth of graphene foam on nickel foam and then filling reduced graphene oxide into the pores of graphene foam, is used to anchor iron phthalocyanine molecules with atomic Fe‒N 4 sites for boosting the oxygen reduction during discharging and nanosized FeNi hydroxides for accelerating the oxygen evolution during charging. As a result, the obtained air electrode exhibited an ultra‐small electrocatalytic overpotential of 0.603 V for oxygen reactions, a high peak power density of 220.2 mW cm ‒2 , and a small and stable charge‒discharge voltage gap of 0.70 V at 10 mA cm ‒2 after 1136 cycles. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy together with theoretical calculations confirmed that phase transformation of FeNi hydroxides takes place from α‐Ni(OH) x to β‐Ni(OH) x to γ‐Ni (3+δ)+ OOH for the oxygen evolution reaction and Ni is the active center while Fe enhances the activity of Ni active sites.

In the anodic catalyst layer of a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer, the triple-phase boundary (TPB) is mainly distributed on the surface of ultrafine iridium-based catalysts encapsulated by the ionomer within the catalyst-ionomer agglomerate. It is found that the ionomer at the TPB acts as a barrier to mass transport and a buffer for the bubble coverage during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The barrier effect can decrease the OER performance of the catalysts inside the agglomerate by ≤23%, while the buffer effect can separate the bubble evolution sites from the OER sites, turning the instant deactivation caused by the bubble coverage into a gradual performance loss caused by local water starvation. However, this local water starvation still deteriorates the catalyst performance because of the affinity of the ionomer surface for bubbles. Introducing additional transport paths into the agglomerate can reduce the barrier effect and regulate the bubble behavior, reducing the overpotential by 0.308 V at 5 A cm

Hydrogen peroxide is a green oxidizing chemical with wide applications in industry. Its production heavily relies on the industrial anthraquinone process, which involves a large number of organic pollutants, challenging green and sustainable development. The recently developed pulsed electrochemical approach holds great potential for the green synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, but it is limited by the absence of highly efficient catalysts. Here, we report a strategy to improve the performance of Ni3S2 catalyst by tuning the content of Ni3+ species. The Ni3S2 catalyst exhibits good performance in oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction processes at the same time, leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. The enrichment of Ni3+ ensures the adsorption of reaction intermediates *O, *OH, and *OOH and promotes electron transfer during the reaction, thus facilitating hydrogen peroxide generation. By tuning the Ni3+ ratio in the Ni3S2 catalyst, the productivity of hydrogen peroxide was enhanced. The prepared hydrogen peroxide was used for propylene oxidation, resulting in pH-dependent products. This study highlights the significance of the design and rational synthesis of electrochemical catalysts for synthesizing hydrogen peroxide, which may be used for the electrochemical synthesis of chemicals.

Developing efficient, economical, and resource-abundant dual-function electrocatalysts for water splitting is crucial. In this study, uniform growth of NiSex nanocrystals on Fe-doped XC-72 carbon (NS/XC-Fe) was achieved through a solvothermal method, resulting in the formation of a composite material with outstanding performance. NS/XC-Fe exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (261 mV, 10 mA·cm−2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (275 mV, 10 mA·cm−2) under alkaline conditions, owing to the introduction of iron and the construction of heterogeneous interfaces. Additionally, NS/XC-Fe exhibited excellent stability during the 24 h polarization test. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the introduction of iron optimized the catalyst's H adsorption capability, while the construction of heterogeneous interfaces lowered the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This demonstrates the significant potential of NS/XC-Fe as an electrocatalyst, providing new insights for the design and synthesis of efficient bifunctional electrochemical water splitting catalysts.

The slow anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) significantly limits electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. We proposed the electrocatalyst for glucose oxidation by Ta-doping NiFe LDH nanosheets to simultaneously obtain glucaric acid (GRA) and hydrogen gas as a useful byproduct. Superior glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) activity is demonstrated by the optimized Ta–NiFe LDH, which has a low overpotential of 192 mV, allowing for a small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec–1 and a current density of 50 mA cm–2. The Ta NiFe LDH-oxidized glucose to GRA with a 72.94% yield and 64.3% Faradaic efficiency at 1.45 VRHE. Herein, we report the Ta NiFe LDH/NF electrode for the GOR&hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which exhibits a cell voltage of 1.62 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm–2, which is 250 mV lower compared to OER&HER (1.87 V). This study reveals that GOR is an energy-efficient and cost-effective method for producing H2 and valorizing biomass.

Developing electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes remains challenging. In this study, we synthesize a self-supported ruthenium-iron oxide on carbon cloth (Ru-Fe-Ox/CC) using solvothermal methods followed by air calcination. The morphology of the nanoparticle exposes numerous active sites vital for electrocatalysis. Additionally, the strong electronic interaction between Ru and Fe enhances electrocatalytic kinetics optimization. The porous structure of the carbon cloth matrix facilitates mass transport, improving electrolyte penetration and bubble release. Consequently, Ru-Fe-Ox/CC demonstrates excellent catalytic performance, achieving low overpotentials of 32 mV and 28 mV for HER and 216 mV and 228 mV for OER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Notably, only 1.48 V and 1.46 V are required to reach 10 mA cm−2 for efficient water-splitting in both mediums, exhibiting remarkable stability. This research offers insights into designing versatile, highly efficient catalysts suitable for varied pH conditions.

This study reported a multi–functional Co0.45Fe0.45Ni0.9–MOF/NF catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting, which was synthesized via a novel shape–preserving two–step hydrothermal method. The resulting bowknot flake structure on NF enhanced the exposure of active sites, fostering a superior electrocatalytic surface, and the synergistic effect between Co, Fe, and Ni enhanced the catalytic activity of the active site. In an alkaline environment, the catalyst exhibited impressive overpotentials of 244 mV and 287 mV at current densities of 50 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Transitioning to a neutral environment, an overpotential of 505 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was achieved with the same catalyst, showing a superior property compared to similar catalysts. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Co0.45Fe0.45Ni0.9–MOF/NF shows versatility as a bifunctional catalyst, excelling in both OER and HER, as well as overall water splitting. The innovative shape–preserving synthesis method presented in this study offers a facile method to develop an efficient electrocatalyst for OER under both alkaline and neutral conditions, which makes it a promising catalyst for hydrogen production by water splitting.

Nickel-molybdenum (NiMo) alloy has been widely concerned in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution because of its excellent hydrogen evolution performance, but at the same time, NiMo alloy also faces the problem of poor oxygen evolution activity and molybdenum dissolution. Unlike other processes involving high-temperature and high-pressure reactions, electrodeposition has the advantages of a simple preparation device, controllable synthesis conditions and a shorter synthesis time. Herein, NiMo alloys with different iron content were prepared by a simple one-step electrodeposition method. The results of XRD and TEM demonstrate the successful doping of Fe. Doping Fe affects the electronic structure of NiMo, accelerates electron transfer and increases the number of active sites. Fe0.2-NiMo shows the best catalytic performance with HER/OER overpotential of 85 mV and 269 mV respectively at 10 mA cm-2. Fe0.2-NiMo can also be applied in large current, and HER/OER overpotential is only 319 mV and 316 mV when the current density is 500 mA cm-2. The resulting cell requires only 1.9 V voltage to achieve a current density of 500 mA cm-2. This work proves that Fe doping strategy is an efficient and feasible strategy for designing bifunctional NiMo alloy based electrocatalysts with high activity.

The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect has garnered extensive attention in semiconductor photocatalysis for solar energy conversion, thanks to its remarkable optical properties. However, the majority SPR‐induced photocatalytic systems have been limited to achieving hydrogen evolution or oxygen evolution half reactions, and attaining overall water splitting on a SPR‐induced photocatalyst under visible light remains a formidable challenging. In this study, we employed a plasmonic photocatalyst Au/SrTiO3, and further enhanced its performance by doping aluminum (Al) into the SrTiO3 lattice (denoted as Au/SrTiO3:Al). By constructing reduction cocatalyst (RhCrOx) and oxidation cocatalyst (CoOOH), the Au/SrTiO3:Al photocatalyst successfully realizes photocatalytic overall water splitting with a stoichiometric ratio of H2 and O2 under visible light (λ ≥ 440 nm). We revealed that the introduction of Al species effectively modified the electronic structure of SrTiO3, thereby enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction in Au/SrTiO3:Al. Simultaneously, the RhCrOx and CoOOH cocatalysts synergistically capitalized on the short‐lived hot electrons and holes generated by the plasmonic Au/SrTiO3:Al photocatalyst, enabling to realize photocatalytic overall water splitting. This work offers a promising avenue for the rational design of plasmon‐induced overall water splitting photocatalysts through the integration of suitable cocatalysts and surface/interface engineering strategies.

Efficient and affordable electrocatalysts are a crucial part of rechargeable zinc air batteries (ZAB) to address the problems caused by the sluggish activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathode. Anchoring noble metals on transition-metal-based substances is a promising strategy to reinforce electrochemical activity and reduce the cost. Herein, we have developed a subsequent spontaneous-redox strategy to load Pt nanoparticles with 3.75% containing NiFe-LDH nanoflakes to boost the ORR activity. After that, NiFe-LDH@ Co9S8 is constructed as a rational design for bifunction catalysis. In the ORR process, the half-wave potential of the obtained catalyst, Pt-anchored NiFe-LDH@Co9S8, is 0.83 V vs RHE, showing better catalytic activity than Pt/C. In the OER process, the obtained catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 280 mV, which is superior to that of RuO2. Notably, aqueous ZAB and quasi-solid-state ZAB achieve peak power densities of 164.3 and 78.4 mW cm–2, respectively. Furthermore, quasi-solid-state ZAB exhibits a long cycle lifespan for 240 cycles in 80 h, and a remarkable stability after bending for 50 cycles. This work paves the way for the design of the NiFe-LDH nanostructure by vacancy engineering.

The development of water splitting catalysts for generating high-purity hydrogen in large-scale is still facing challenges in terms of improving efficiency and stability. Herein, Ni3S2-coated NiFe layered double hydroxides sub-nanosheets with a hierarchical heterostructure (NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2) were prepared on nickel foam (NF) by a strategy of continuous hydrothermal synthesis. The introduction of S2− broke the hydrogen bonds between NiFe-LDH layers and separated into sub-nanosheets with a thickness of only about 1 nm, which enlarged the active areas of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF by a factor of 5.7. The coexisting charge channels Ni-O-Ni and Ni-S-Ni in the material enhanced the electrochemical activity, resulting in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials as low as 179 mV and 116 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, after a 50-hour chronopotentiometry test at 50 mA cm−2, the overpotential for OER and HER decreased only 0.013 V and 0.059 V, respectively. Furthermore, under the conditions of simulating industrial hydrogen production with an electrolyte of 6.0 M KOH and a temperature of 75 °C, after a 140-hour test for durability, the current density decreased only 0.75% at the cell voltage of 1.70 V.

Abstract Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) stands out as an economical and prospective technology to replace oxygen evolution reaction for co‐producing high‐valued chemicals and hydrogen (H 2 ). Regulating the adsorption of glycerol (GLY) and hydroxyl (OH) species is of great significance for improving the GOR performance. Herein, a hierarchical p–n heterojunction by combining Co‐metal organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with CuO nanorod arrays (CuO@Co‐MOF) is developed to realize the optimization on GOR. Specifically, CuO@Co‐MOF electrode exhibits superior performance with a conversion of 98.4%, formic acid (FA) selectivity of 87.3%, and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.9%. The flow‐cell system with the bifunctional CuO@Co‐MOF electrode for pairing GOR with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reveals better energy conversion efficiency. Experimental results and theoretical calculations unravel the redistributed electric field by introducing Co‐containing species that contribute to the improved performance, which not only enhances the OH adsorption but also modulates the excessive GLY adsorption of CuO, thus reducing reaction energy barriers of FA desorption. Simultaneously, finite element analysis reveals that the novelty hierarchical structure can increase the concentration of OH − and facilitate the mass transfer of OH − in the solution.

Summary Woody plants display some photosynthetic activity in stems, but the biological role of stem photosynthesis and the specific contributions of bark and wood to carbon uptake and oxygen evolution remain poorly understood. We aimed to elucidate the functional characteristics of chloroplasts in stems of different ages in Fraxinus ornus . Our investigation employed diverse experimental approaches, including microsensor technology to assess oxygen production rates in whole stem, bark, and wood separately. Additionally, we utilized fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to characterize the relative abundance of photosystems I and II (PSI : PSII chlorophyll ratio) in bark and wood. Our findings revealed light‐induced increases in O 2 production in whole stem, bark, and wood. We present the radial profile of O 2 production in F. ornus stems, demonstrating the capability of stem chloroplasts to perform light‐dependent electron transport. Younger stems exhibited higher light‐induced O 2 production and dark respiration rates than older ones. While bark emerged as the primary contributor to net O 2 production under light conditions, our data underscored that wood chloroplasts are also photosynthetically active. The FLIM analysis unveiled a lower PSI abundance in wood than in bark, suggesting stem chloroplasts are not only active but also acclimate to the spectral composition of light reaching inner compartments.

Zinc–air battery as one of the new generations of battery system, its theoretical specific energy is as high as 1086 Wh kg−1, specific capacity up to 820 mAh/g, and zinc has the advantages of environmental friendliness, resource abundance, low cost and good safety, so it has attracted much attention. However, due to its slow reaction kinetic process, zinc–air battery will produce a large charging overpotential usually up to 2 V, it is far beyond the theoretical voltage of 1.65 V, so reducing the overpotential of zinc–air batteries is extremely necessary, and the most common way to solve this problem is to use excellent catalyst cathode to improve the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution kinetics of zinc–air batteries. So we developed a new photothermal assisted zinc–air battery system with Hollow carbon nanosphere@poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene)@CdS (HCN@PVTC@CdS) photocathode, the pyroelectric and photocatalysis effect can effectively promote the reaction kinetics and reduce the reaction overpotential. With the pyroelectric and photocatalysis synergistic effect, the zinc–air has displayed a high discharge potential of 1.33 V and a low charging potential of 1.5 V with good cycle stability. This multi-assist technology with built-in electric and light fields paves the way for the development of high-performance zinc–air batteries and other energy storage systems.

Hydrogen production by electrolysis of water is gradually becoming the main way to obtain green energy, but due to the scarcity of fresh water resources in the world, so the study of urea and seawater electrolysis has become an important work. In this experiment, different metal ions M (M=Co, Cr, Cu, Zn) doped Ni3S2/FeS were investigated as catalysts with good catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as in urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea electrolyte, and Co-Ni3S2/FeS and Cr-Ni3S2/FeS, which performed well in HER and UOR, were assembled into an electrolytic cell for the overall urea decomposition (1.50 V @ 10 mA cm−2). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that Co-Ni3S2 possesses a lower free energy for H, while FeS possesses a higher density of states (DOS) near the Fermi energy level, and such a composite structure promotes significantly the catalytic activity of HER. The catalytic effect of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was further investigated in the seawater electrolyte, and the results showed that the performance of Co-Ni3S2/FeS catalyst was better, and certain ions in seawater affected durability of the catalyst. The electronic structure of the catalyst was investigated through the characterization of the catalyst and combined with the special morphology jointly promote the catalytic reaction in electrolysis experiments, which provides a candidate catalyst for electrolysis of urea and seawater oxidation reaction.

In situ growth of nanoarrays on conductive substrates is an efficient strategy for designing electrocatalysts. However, preparing array with excellent catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a challenge. Here, we construct a novel hollow sugar gourd-like Ni-Co-S@NiMoO4·xH2O/NF nanocage array through MOF derivation strategy for stable solar-driven overall water splitting. Due to the hollow core–shell structure and multi-component advantages, the Ni-Co-S@NiMoO4·xH2O/NF presents high density of active sites and fast charge transfer rate. Therefore, Ni-Co-S@NiMoO4·xH2O/NF exhibits attractive electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes for HER (90 mV@10 mA cm−2) and OER (208 mV@10 mA cm−2, 245 mV@100 mA cm−2). The corresponding two-electrode electrolytic cell demonstrates small cell voltage (1.515 V @ 10 mA cm−2) and shows durability over 50 h at 10 mA cm−2, exhibiting excellent overall water splitting performance. It is worth noting that the solar-assisted electrolysis cell reaches a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion rate of 19.4 %. The construction of this unique hollow structure gives a fascinating method for improving the HER and OER performance of transition metal sulfide electrocatalysts.

Designing hybrid photoelectrodes with graphene capable of efficient charge-carrier transfer and excellent chemical stability is an effective strategy for developing high-performance photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. However, it remains unclear how the PEC properties are enhanced and how to control the junction properties in graphene/metal oxide heterojunction-based photoelectrodes. Here, we develop a deterministic junction to enhance PEC performance in graphene/tungsten trioxide (WO3)-based photoelectrodes by tuning the work function of graphene. It reveals that the band structure of graphene/WO3 heterojunctions can be modified by ultraviolet (UV) treatment on WO3 thin films. This modification is supported by the observation that a single-layer graphene/UV-treated WO3 photoelectrode exhibits significantly enhanced PEC activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (evidenced by features like a threefold increase in photocurrent, an onset potential shift, and improved stability), whereas the single-layer graphene/untreated WO3 electrode demonstrates improved properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, defects in the graphene layer formed during PEC water splitting contribute to high catalytic activities of the graphene/WO3 photoelectrode due to a decrease in the Gibbs free energy for OER and HER. These results emphasize that band structure engineering via work function tuning in graphene/WO3 heterostructures can provide multiple benefits for high PEC performance and long-term stability.

It is a pressing need to develop new energy materials to address the existing energy crisis. However, screening optimal targets out of thousands of materials candidates remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose and validate an alternative concept for highly effective materials screening based on dual-atom salphen catalysis units. Such an approach simplifies the design of catalytic materials and reforms the trial-and-error experimental model into a building-blocks-assembly like process. Firstly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on a series of potential catalysis units which were possible to synthesize. Then, machine learning (ML) was employed to define the structure-performance relationship and acquire chemical insights. Afterwards, the projected catalysis units were integrated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to validate the concept Electrochemical tests confirm that Ni-SalphenCOF and Co-SalphenCOF are promising conductive agent-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work provides a fast-tracked strategy for design and development of functional materials, which serves as a potentially workable framework for seamlessly integrating DFT calculations, ML, and experimental approaches.

Despite the potential of heterostructure construction and surface reconstruction strategies to significantly enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of transition metal compounds, integrating these approaches into a single material system remains a significant challenge. In this work, we report an efficient CoFe-LDH catalyst with multi-metal nitrides on the surface through simple and tunable N2-plasma treatment. Structural and chemical state characterization indicates a high concentration of defective sites in PL CoFe-LDH, which facilitates the exposure of a greater number of active N-Fe-O and N-Co-O centers. During the initial stage of the OER process, there is a rapid phase transition of Fe and Co, leading to the formation of metal (oxy)hydroxides. Meanwhile, Co3+ species gradually accumulate on the surfaces, which is responsible for the excellent OER catalytic activity. Then, the neighboring N atoms function as electron reservoirs, donating electrons to the Co sites to prevent overoxidation and dissolution of Co in the electrolyte, thus significantly enhancing the stability of the OER. The catalysts enable the achievement of ultralow OER overpotential, measuring 161.1 and 205.5 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 200 mA cm-2, respectively, while exhibiting exceptional stability.

There is a flurry of interest in enhancing the stability and efficiency of photoelectrocatalysts in water splitting at high current densities. In the present study, nickel–iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) was decorated with MIP-177-LT (Ti-metal organic framework (MOF)) to fabricate a heteroatom electrocatalyst (NiFe-LDH@Ti-MOF). The overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) turned out to be very low: 199 and 232 mV at current densities of 200 and 600 mA cm−2, in that order. Then, current densities of 1,000 mA cm−2 were applied to the modified electrode over a long period of 800 h, and this generated a higher stability than that of the commercial IrO2. Further, its mass activity proved ∼2 and 7 times as high as those of IrO2 and NiFe-LDH, in that order. Furthermore, for water splitting, the produced photoelectrocatalyst obtained a current density of 1,000 mA cm−2 using only 1.6 V, and this performance remained changeless for 800 h, which can be considered the most superb performance ever reported. The experimental characterization revealed that during the process of doping Ti-MOF on NiFe-LDH, symmetry breaking takes place in the atomic structure of the LDH surface, which increases the active sites in the photoelectrocatalyst. The presence of oxygen in the Ti-MOF active sites improves the efficiency of OER at high current densities and also contributes to the higher stability of multiple heteroatomic interfaces for water splitting. The propounded strategy enables the generation of oxygen and hydrogen from water splitting at high current densities on an industrial scale by changing the symmetry of the atomic structure of heteroatomic photocatalysts.

The goal of developing efficient electrocatalysts that can effectively accelerate both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is essential. Additionally, overcoming the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) also presents a considerable challenge for achieving energy-efficient hydrogen (H2) production. Herein, we report the synthesis of self-supported hierarchical FeOOH/Fe0.5CoCr0.5-LDHs as an advanced electrocatalyst by employing simultaneous engineering strategies for producing the formate from MOR at the anode while simultaneously generating H2 at the cathode. Both the experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate the superior charge transfer enabled by the in-situ formed heterostructure. Additionally, electronic modulation due to Cr intercalation, and the presence of a superhydrophilic hybrid surface morphology promote the remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability of the FeOOH/Fe0.5CoCr0.5-LDHs electrocatalyst. The overall water splitting process required a cell voltage of 2.01 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2, whereas a lower cell voltage of 1.76 V was sufficient for overall methanol oxidation. Remarkably, a solar-driven system prototype, consisting of a commercial Si cell combined with a methanol splitting electrolyzer comprising FeOOH/Fe0.5CoCr0.5-LDHs electrodes, achieved a photocurrent density of 8.1 mA cm-2 over 2h. This work demonstrates the capability of earth-abundant elements-based electrocatalysts for sustainable and selective electrochemical synthesis. As a result, it enables the energy-efficient generation of clean H2 and valuable chemicals byproducts.

Abstract Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) features a lower overpotential compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during electrolysis, facilitating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. The distribution of charge plays a pivotal role in promoting the adsorption and cleavage of chemical groups in urea molecules, which can be modulated by introducing a heterostructure. Herein, a CoS 1.097 /Ni 3 S 2 heterojunction grown on nickel foam is designed, serving simultaneously for UOR and HER. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the spontaneous charge transfer at the CoS 1.097 /Ni 3 S 2 heterointerface induces the formation of localized electrophilic/nucleophilic regions, intelligently adsorbing electron‐donating/electron‐withdrawing groups in urea molecules, activating chemical bonds, thereby triggering urea decomposition. CoS 1.097 /Ni 3 S 2 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for urea, requiring only a potential of 1.22 V (with an overpotential of 0.85 V) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm −2 in UOR, and potentials of 1.27 and 1.57 V to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm −2 , respectively, in a UOR//HER electrolysis cell, maintaining good stability at high current density for 60 h. Tests in real urine have demonstrated performance similar to that in urea electrolyte. This work represents nearly the best catalytic performance of transition metal‐based materials in UOR applications, promising for both efficient hydrogen production and urea decomposition.

A shift to alternate energy sources is needed at the present time to address rising environmental concerns. The current research work aims to use a chemical‐free and green route to synthesize nanocomposite for their application as an electrode in the generation as well as storage of energy. Subsequently, the green synthesis of Bi 2 O 3 ‐Sb 2 O 3 nanocomposite was carried out using the leaf extract of Amaranthus viridis . The synthesized nanocomposite revealed a well‐arranged pattern of spherical nanoparticles with a crystal size of 29.43 nm and a band gap value of 2.5 eV. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potentials of Bi 2 O 3 ‐Sb 2 O 3 were studied through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), whereas the energy storage studies were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) techniques. The synthesized nanomaterial showed promising results for HER with an overpotential value of 205 mV as compared with OER, where an overpotential value of 450 mV was observed. However, excellent cyclic stability was witnessed for both reactions up to 1000 cycles. CV studies revealed an outstanding capacitance value of 348 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s, whereas a specific capacitance of 269.5 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g was observed using GCD. The 15 h of electrode stability further endorsed the potential of synthesized material for energy‐based applications.

Photoelectrochemical hydrogen production technology holds promise for directly and swiftly generating green hydrogen, which is pivotal for human welfare; however, it faces challenges posed by the energetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Cobalt-based nitrides are considered excellent photoelectrochemical OER (PEOER) catalysts, and their conductivity and photoconversion efficiency remain relatively low. Additionally, the role of nitrogen elements in the OER process is often overlooked. This paper presents the fabrication of Ni-alloyed Co4N nanowire arrays on carbon cloth ((Co1-xNix)4N NWAs/CC) as PEOER catalysts. By analyzing advanced in-situ Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, we discovered that Ni not only enhances the conductivity of the catalyst but, more importantly, also creates more photoexcited Co2+ OER centers and favors its reconstruction to CoOOH to charge PEOER. Furthermore, nitrogen plays a critical role in transforming pyridinic nitrogen into other forms of nitrogen to stabilize the catalyst's structure. These advantages endow (Co0.7Ni0.3)4N NWAs/CC with remarkable PEOER enhancement (988%), which drives the standard current density of 10 mA cm-2 with only 283 mV overpotential along with good durability. This research provides insights into the PEOER mechanisms of cobalt-based transition metal nitrides, providing a way for designing next-generation PEOER catalysts.

Abstract Space charge transfer, which can be provided by heterogeneous structure, is the key to efficient electrocatalytic processes. However, difficulty in controlling the relative atomic diffusion rates due to different atomic radii and affinity makes heterogeneous nanostructures difficult to be accurately designed. Herein, an induced diffusion strategy based on affinity differences between elements is proposed to direct the separation/aggregation of different components in the precursor. The key to strategy in this study is the different affinity of Cu and Co to S/P in the precursor of CuCo Prussian blue analogue (PBA). By controlling the molar ratio of S and P during the phosphorization/vulcanization process, induced diffusion can be achieved and leads to directional separation/aggregation of Cu and Co species. As a result, a heterogeneous yolk‐shell Cu 2 S@CoP 2 ‐C‐N‐S structure is successfully synthesized with a reticular CoP2‐C‐N‐Cu‐S as the shell and a Cu 2 S nanocrystal as the core. The space charge effect of the semiconductor heterojunction resulting from component separation/aggregation significantly promotes oxygen evolution reaction, resulting in an ultralow overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA·cm −2 . This work not only provides a simple method for efficient separation of key components in gas‐solid systems but also provides a method for fine‐tuning the active site in an active‐site‐engineering approach.

Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GLYOR) could be a promising way to use the abundantly available glycerol for production of value-added chemicals and fuels. Completely avoiding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with GLYOR is an evolving strategy to reduce the overall cell potential and generate value-added chemicals and fuels on both the anode and cathode. We demonstrate the morphology-controlled palladium nanocrystals, afforded by colloidal chemistry, and their established morphology-dependent GLYOR performance. Although it is known that controlling the morphology of an electrocatalyst can modulate the activity and selectivity of the products, still it is a relatively underexplored area for many reactions, including GLYOR. Among nanocube (Pd-NC), truncated octahedron (Pd-TO), spherical and polycrystalline (Pd-PC) morphologies, the Pd-NC electrocatalyst deposited on a Ni foam exhibits the highest glycerol conversion (85%) along with 42% glyceric acid selectivity at a low applied potential of 0.6 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in 0.1 M glycerol and 1 M KOH at ambient temperature. Owing to the much favorable thermodynamics of GLYOR on the Pd-NC surface, the assembled electrolyzer requires an electricity input of only ∼3.7 kWh/m3 of H2 at a current density of 100 mA/cm2, in contrast to the requirement of ≥5 kWh/m3 of H2 with an alkaline/PEM electrolyzer. Sustainability has been successfully demonstrated at 10 and 50 mA/cm2 and up to 120 h with GLYOR in water and simulated seawater.

In the application of renewable energy, the oxidation–reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two crucial reactions. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on metal-doped graphene have been widely employed due to their high activity and high atom utilization efficiency. However, the catalytic activity is significantly influenced by different metals and local coordination, making it challenging to efficiently screen through either experimental or density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To address this issue, this study employed a combination of DFT calculations and machine learning (DFT-ML) to investigate rare earth-modified carbon-based (RENxC6–x) electrocatalysts. Based on computational data from 75 catalysts, we trained two ML models to capture the underlying patterns of physical properties and overpotential. Subsequently, the candidate catalysts were screened, leading to the discovery of four ORR catalysts, nine OER catalysts, and five bifunctional electrocatalysts, all of which were thoroughly validated for their stability. Lastly, by integrating the ML models with the SHAP analysis framework, we revealed the influence of atomic radius, Pauling electronegativity, and other features on the catalytic activity. Additionally, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of potential catalysts through DFT calculations. The revolutionary DFT-ML approach provides a crucial driving force for the design and synthesis of potential catalysts in subsequent studies.

Abstract The interfacial instability between PEO‐based solid electrolyte (SPE) and high‐voltage cathode materials inhibits the longevity of high‐energy‐density all‐solid‐state polymer lithium metal batteries (ASSPLBs). Herein, for the first time it is demonstrated, that contact loss caused by gas generation from interfacial side reactions between the high‐voltage cathode and solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) can also arise in ASSPLBs. To alleviate the interfacial side reactions, a LiNb 0.6 Ti 0.5 O 3 (LNTO) layer is well coated on LiNi 0.83 Co 0.07 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM83), denoted as (CNCM83). The LNTO layer with low electronic conductivity reduces the decomposition drive force of SPE. Furthermore, Ti and Nb in the LNTO layer spontaneously migrate inside the NCM83 surface to form a strong Ti/Nb─O bond, stalling oxygen evolution in high‐voltage cathodes. The interfacial degradation phenomena, including SPE decomposition, detrimental phase transition and intragranular cracks of NCM83, and void formation between cathode and SPE, are effectively mitigated by the LNTO layer. Therefore, the growth rate of interfacial resistance (R CEI ) decreases from 37.6 Ω h −0.5 for bare NCM83 to 2.4 Ω h −0.5 for CNCM83 at 4.2 V. Moreover, 4.2 V PEO‐based ASSPLBs achieve impressive cyclability with high capacity retention of 135 mAh g −1 (75%) even after 300 cycles at 0.5 C.

The growing issue of salinity is a significant threat to global agriculture, affecting diverse regions worldwide. Nitric oxide (NO) serves as an essential signal molecule in regulating photosynthetic performance under physiological and stress conditions. The present study reveals the protective effects of different concentrations (0–300 µM) of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a donor of NO) on the functions of the main complexes within the photosynthetic apparatus of maize (Zea mays L. Kerala) under salt stress (150 mM NaCl). The data showed that SNP alleviates salt-induced oxidative stress and prevents changes in the fluidity of thylakoid membranes (Laurdan GP) and energy redistribution between the two photosystems (77K chlorophyll fluorescence ratio F735/F685). Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the foliar spray with SNP under salt stress prevents the decline of photosystem II (PSII) open reaction centers (qP) and improves their efficiency (Φexc), thereby influencing QA− reoxidation. The data also revealed that SNP protects the rate constants for two pathways of QA− reoxidation (k1 and k2) from the changes caused by NaCl treatment alone. Additionally, there is a predominance of QA− interaction with plastoquinone in comparison to the recombination of electrons in QA QB− with the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The analysis of flash oxygen evolution showed that SNP treatment prevents a salt-induced 10% increase in PSII centers in the S0 state, i.e., protects the initial S0–S1 state distribution, and the modification of the Mn cluster in the OEC. Moreover, this study demonstrates that SNP-induced defense occurs on both the donor and acceptor sides of the PSII, leading to the protection of overall photosystems performance (PIABS) and efficient electron transfer from the PSII donor side to the reduction of PSI end electron acceptors (PItotal). This study clearly shows that the optimal protection under salt stress occurs at approximately 50–63 nmoles NO/g FW in leaves, corresponding to foliar spray with 50–150 µM SNP.

Facile template-free hydrothermal method was utilized for preparing CuO nanostructures (NSs) doped with Co element (Cu1-xCoxO (x=0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08)). A single-phase monoclinic crystal with changing in morphology from rod- to sphere-like nanoparticles was observed. . The temperature dependency of DC electrical conductivity revealed that the shallow and deep donor levels are responsible for the DC conduction in low and high temperature ranges, respectively. The Ac electrical conductivity, dielectric constant and dielectric loss were also measured as functions in frequency and temperature. The frequency dependence of the AC conductivity was well represented by the Jonscher's universal power law. The AC conduction was governed by the Correlated Barrier Hopping model where the inter-well and intra-well hopping mechanisms contribute to the electrical conduction in the low and high frequency ranges, respectively. The activation energies and the barrier height decreased while the dielectric constant and dielectric loss increased with increasing the Co content. The relaxation and deformational polarizations predominate and the overall behavior of dielectric constant fits well with the Koops' model. The Cole-Cole plots indicated a decrease in the sample resistance with increasing temperatures and Co concentrations. UV-vis absorption spectra exhibited two peaks at wavelengths 252 and 323 nm. The optical energy gap was calculated using Tauc's equation and decrease from 2.24 to 2.1 eV with increasing the Co concentrations. The effect of Co-doping on CuO was explored for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and found a decrease in the overvoltage (μ) about 50 mV at 0.08 ratios, which declares that the doping of Co element enhances the electrical conductivity and feasibility for further electrocatalytic improvement.

Dealloying is a proficient technique in the fabrication of nanostructured metals, particularly nanoporous materials, with promising potential for diverse applications. However, the development of robust and self-standing nanostructured metal foils through dealloying presents significant challenges. By generating an alloy layer on the surface of the metal foil, nanostructures can be generated on the metal foil surface through subsequent dealloying. This approach utilizes the inherent flexibility and ductility of the metal foil to ensure self-support. It also allows for the tailoring of the structure and composition of the dealloyed nanostructured metal by manipulation of the phase constitution in the surface alloy layer. In this study, we report a strategy for generating alloy layers on metal foil surfaces through the thermal evaporation of magnesium (Mg) followed by annealing. Upon dealloying the surface alloy layer, we successfully obtain self-supported nanostructured metal foils. Employing copper (Cu) as an example, we demonstrate that Mg can form a Mg–Cu alloy layer on the surface of a Cu foil, where the control over the alloy layer's phase composition and thickness is achieved by adjusting the annealing duration. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of this method on nickel (Ni) substrates, including Ni foils and Ni foams. Moreover, by further functionalizing the resulting nanostructured Ni foil, we transformed it into Ni(OH)2/Ni foil and explored its performance in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The resulting catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a potential of only 349 mV in a 1 M KOH solution, exhibiting a Tafel slope of 84.52 mV dec−1. Following 10 h of stability testing, the catalyst exhibited negligible degradation in performance. This study provides a convenient and versatile pathway for preparing self-supported nanostructured metals.

The rise of concentration resistance caused by bubble growth is a key factor affecting the photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency. In this research, we employed an electrochemical workstation, a synchronized measuring system, and a CCD camera to investigate the in-situ evolution of oxygen bubbles on the surfaces of TiO2-NTAs and C/TiO2-NTAs electrodes. The connection among the critical nucleation, growth and departure behavior of a single bubble on the photoanode surface and photocurrent curves at different solution pH (1–13) has been investigated. For TiO2-NTAs, it was found that strong alkalinity significantly reduces the voltage required for critical bubble nucleation. The photocurrent rises approximately 1.5 times when the control voltage is 0.10 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) by pH increasing from 1 to 13 and while the bubble evolution cycles decline by approximately 3.2 times. The photocurrent rises by 10.4 times compared with pH = 9 and by 7.3 times compared with pH = 13 when the control voltage is 0.71 V (vs. RHE), respectively. We also found that the oxygen bubble evolution of C/TiO2-NTAs is similar to TiO2-NTAs. When pH = 3–13, the average photocurrent of C/TiO2-NTAs electrode is higher than that of TiO2-NTAs, and the average bubble evolution cycles are lower than those of TiO2-NTAs at the same pH. According to the results, carbon films can rise the absorption capacity of TiO2-NTAs and significantly improve the effectiveness of photogenerated holes and electrons departure. Meanwhile, based on the oxygen bubble force balance model on the photoanode surface, the concentration Marangoni force rises with the increase of pH, which leads to the growth of bubble departure diameter. The outcomes demonstrate that oxygen bubbles on the photoanode surface can be successfully eliminated in strongly alkaline settings.

JWST observations of the 7-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will provide an excellent opportunity to test outcomes of stellar-driven evolution of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, including atmospheric escape, ocean loss and abiotic oxygen production. While most previous studies use a single luminosity evolution for the host star, we incorporate observational uncertainties in stellar mass, luminosity evolution, system age, and planetary parameters to statistically explore the plausible range of planetary atmospheric escape outcomes. We present probabilistic distributions of total water loss and oxygen production as a function of initial water content, for planets with initially pure water atmospheres and no interior-atmosphere exchange. We find that the interior planets are desiccated for initial water contents below 50 Earth oceans. For TRAPPIST-1e, f, g, and h, we report maximum water loss ranges of 8.0$^{+1.3}_{-0.9}$, 4.8$^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$, 3.4$^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$, and 0.8$^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ Earth oceans, respectively, with corresponding maximum oxygen retention of 1290$^{+75}_{-75}$, 800$^{+40}_{-40}$, 560$^{+30}_{-25}$, and 90$^{+10}_{-10}$ bars. We explore statistical constraints on initial water content imposed by current water content, which could inform evolutionary history and planet formation. If TRAPPIST-1b is airless while TRAPPIST-1c possesses a tenuous oxygen atmosphere, as initial JWST observations suggest, then our models predict an initial surface water content of 8.2$^{+1.5}_{-1.0}$ Earth oceans for these worlds, leading to the outer planets retaining $>$1.5 Earth oceans after entering the habitable zone. Even if TRAPPIST-1c is airless, surface water on the outer planets would not be precluded.

Perovskite oxygen carriers in a methane chemical looping partial oxidation process enable high reactivity over 850 °C. Lowering the reaction temperature helps to circumvent energy dissipation and couple the above-mentioned process with energy-efficient systems. This paper demonstrates the attractive oxygen-donating capacity of Fe–Ni-based perovskite oxygen carriers for methane partial oxidation. The aforesaid process exhibits more than 70% methane conversion and 6.71 mmol·g–1 unit syngas yield at 700 °C, using LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3. This impressive high reactivity mainly originates from the lowered lattice oxygen bonding strength and the spontaneously constructed active Ni-rich surface of perovskite oxides by Ni doping. In addition to the outward migration of lattice oxygen, active metal elements, such as Ni, continuously segregate to the surface with the reduction of perovskite oxides, promoting methane partial oxidation. We speculate that the chemical looping reaction pathway consists of consecutive competitive reactions based on analysis of the real-time product distribution and the dynamic evolution of oxygen carriers. Highly selective syngas production can be achieved on LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 by reducing reaction temperatures or increasing space velocity to balance methane dissociation and lattice oxygen release kinetics. Irreversible Ni segregation and phase-separation-induced inert La2O3 on the surface of perovskite oxides during redox cycles are responsible for the cyclic performance degradation of oxygen carriers. This work offers intriguing references to design perovskite oxygen carriers for intensifying the medium-temperature chemical looping partial oxidation process.

The chemical reactions and phase transitions at high voltages determine the electrochemical properties of high voltage layered cathodes such as Ni-rich rhombohedral materials. Here, we performed a comprehensive and comparative study of the cationic and anionic redox reactions, as well as the structural evolution of a series of industrial Ni-rich layered cathode materials with and without Al doping, which are being utilized in the cells made by LG Energy Solutions Co.. We combined the results from X-ray spectroscopy, operando electrochemical mass spectrometry, and neutron diffraction with electrochemical properties, and revealed the different oxygen activities associated with structural and electrochemical degradations. We show that Al doping suppresses the irreversible oxygen release thereby enhancing the reversible lattice oxygen redox resulting from the interplay between static (doped Al) and dynamic disorders (reversible oxygen redox). With this modulated oxygen activity, the Ni-rich cathode's notorious H2-H3 structural phase transition becomes highly reversible. Our findings disentangle the different oxygen activities during high-voltage cycling and clarify the role of dopants in the Ni-rich layered cathodes in terms of structural and electrochemical stability finally making all the cell makers get back to the fundamental investigation regarding whether high-Ni NCM chemistry (NCM811 or NCM 91/2 1/2) is substantially beneficial compared to its mid-Ni homologues (NCM622).

The article presents an overview of the research contributions in the field of Marine Micropaleontology and Paleoceanography, made by the Indian scientists during the last five years. Keeping pace with recent development in analytical techniques, significant contributions have been made in diversified research aspects: paleoceanographic proxy development, Asian monsoon variability and dynamics, Neogene-Quaternary evolution of the Indian Ocean in relation to the global climate change, carbonate cycle and ocean acidification, development of oxygen minimum zone and its variability through time. Although, the major emphasis is given to the Indian Ocean paleoceanographic studies, a few Indian research groups are also actively engaged in understanding ocean-climate evolution of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, inter-basinal connections and their implications on global ocean deep circulation and climate on tectonic to millennial time scales.

Photocatalytic water splitting by semiconductors is considered a promising and cost-effective method for achieving sustainable hydrogen production. In this study, a CF/SrTiO3/In2O3 photocatalytic material with a double-layer core–shell structure was developed. The experimental results indicated that the produced CF/SrTiO3/In2O3 composite fiber displayed superior photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, achieving a hydrogen evolution rate of approximately 320.71 μmol/g·h, which is roughly seven times higher than that of the CF/SrTiO3 fiber alone. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the CF/SrTiO3/In2O3 fiber can be attributed to the heterojunction structure enriched with oxygen vacancies. It was found that these oxygen vacancies created defective states that served as traps for photogenerated electrons, facilitating their migration to the surface defect states and enabling the reduction of H+ in water to produce hydrogen. Furthermore, the synergy between the heterojunction structure and the conductivity of the carbon fiber promoted the generation and migration of photogenerated electrons, reduced the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and ultimately improved photocatalytic hydrogen production. This study presents a new approach for designing efficient photocatalysts with surface oxygen vacancies on carbon fibers, providing new insights into the sustainable application of photocatalysts.

Many functional materials are applied in the form of nanosized particles.To follow their structural evolution during reactions, in situ X ray powder diffraction or in situ neutron powder diffraction can miss out on details due to this small particle size.In such cases, in situ 3DED (three dimensional electron diffraction) would allow to gather single crystal type information on the structural changes.However, currently there are still many open questions on how the results from in situ 3DED relate to ex situ results and results from bulk experiments.Using closed cell environmental holders (gas, liquid, electrochemistry), combined with heating and cooling holders, we have studied their structural evolutions during redox reactions during heating in O2 and H2 versus vacuum of a range of perovskite based materials and have systematically related the resulting reduced structures to those obtained by other techniques.For Sr2Fe2O5 (Pcmb), investigated for solid oxide fuel cells, chemical looping and heterogeneous catalysis, in situ XRD and in situ NPD in gas environments only observed transformations between brownmillerite and perovskite type (Pm-3m) structures, while in situ 3DED allowed to also observe an intermediate Cmmm phase known from ex situ and electrochemistry experiments before reaching the perovskite type phase.In situ 3DED also showed the manifestation of nanotwins upon oxidation.After reducing the oxidized phase again in hydrogen at 700°C, the ordering of the tetrahedral chains between planes was lost but the order within planes remained.Cooling instead the oxidized phase in oxygen resulted in an intergrowth of brownmillerite and perovskite.[1] The reduction of the Ruddlesden-Popper structure La0.5Sr1.5MnO4,also a candidate for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes, resulted in the creation of a perovskite layer at the surface which was not noticed before in bulk in situ experiments involving redox reactions in gas.Parallel ex situ reductions showed also faint superstructure reflections in the 3DED datasets pointing towards a surface reconstruction with ordered oxygen vacancies, which could not be detected in the in situ 3DED experiments.Differences in surface layers are important as they are the most active parts in catalytic reactions.Sr2MnO 4 could not be reduced using an in situ reaction with H2 into the supercell with oxygen-vacancy order from literature, while this did succeed during parallel ex situ reduction experiments as well as during in situ heating in vacuum.CaMnO3, a material for chemical looping applications, was successfully reduced using in situ reduction both by heating in hydrogen gas as well as by heating in vacuum, achieving not only the well characterized CaMnO2.5 phase, but also the intermediate CaMnO2.75, which was thus far not solved and had contradicting models in literature.Using the results from the in situ 3DED experiments, the CaMnO2.75 was solved in a Pmmm space group.These results were then compared to in situ 3DED results on the evolution of the Fe and Sr doped compounds which show better chemical looping properties.In situ 3DED in gas environments has thus already given new, complementary information to what was observed with in situ XRD and in situ NPD for each perovskite based material we have studied so far.We therefore believe that in future studies in situ 3DED will unlock a vast amount of new information on functional materials in general.

Abstract Defects can introduce atomic structural modulation and tailor performance of materials. Herein, it demonstrates that semiconductor WO 3 with inert electrocatalytic behavior can be activated through defect‐induced tensile strains. Structural characterizations reveal that when simply treated in Ar/H 2 atmosphere, oxygen vacancies will generate in WO 3 and cause defective structures. Stacking faults are found in defects, thus modulating electronic structure and transforming electrocatalytic‐inert WO 3 into highly active electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to calculate * H adsorption energies on various WO x surfaces, revealing the oxygen vacancy composition and strain predicted to optimize the catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Such defective tungsten oxides can be integrated into commercial proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser with comparable performance toward Pt‐based PEM. This work demonstrates defective metal oxides as promising non‐noble metal catalysts for commercial PEM green‐hydrogen generation.    

    

## Buoyancy control and air breathing in royal knifefish (Chitala blanci) and a new hypothesis for the early evolution of vertebrate air‐breathing behaviors

Abstract We present the first description of inspiration‐first air breaths in royal knifefish, Chitala blanci , a ray‐finned fish known to use four‐stroke air breaths. Four‐stroke breaths are used by nearly all ray‐finned fish species that use their gas bladder to breathe air and are the ancestral breath type of ray‐finned fishes. Interestingly, one such species, Amia calva , is known to perform two distinct breath types. Amia use four‐stroke breaths when they need more oxygen and performs inspiration‐first breaths to restore buoyancy. We observed that C. blanci also performs inspiration‐first breaths and tested whether the two breath types are performed for the same functions in C. blanci as they are in Amia . We recorded the frequency of each breath type when exposed to aquatic hypoxia and two conditions of oxygen availability. We found that C. blanci performed more four‐stroke breaths (81% ± 15% of total breaths) than inspiration‐first breaths when exposed to aerial normoxia but performed more inspiration‐first breaths (72% ± 40%) than four‐stroke breaths when exposed to aerial hyperoxia. These patterns match those described for Amia and indicate that C. blanci performs four‐stroke breaths in response to oxygen depletion and performs inspiration‐first breaths to maintain buoyancy. Few studies have examined the role of air‐breathing in buoyancy regulation. Decreasing buoyancy, rather than oxygen availability, to stimulate air breaths may reveal that inspiration‐first breaths are more common among fishes than we are aware. We consider this possibility and present a new hypothesis for the origin and early evolution of air breathing in vertebrates.

Despite neutrophil involvement in inflammation and tissue repair, little is understood about their inflammatory status in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with poor outcomes. Hence, we investigated the potential correlation between neutrophil inflammatory markers and the prognosis of ACS patients with/without diabetes and explored whether neutrophils demonstrate a unique inflammatory phenotype in patients experiencing an adverse in-hospital outcome. The study enrolled 229 ACS patients with or without diabetes. Poor evolution was defined as either death, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, Killip Class 3/4, ventricular arrhythmias, or mechanical complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to identify clinical and paraclinical factors associated with in-hospital outcomes. Neutrophils isolated from fresh blood were investigated using qPCR, Western blot, enzymatic assay, and immunofluorescence. Poor evolution post-myocardial infarction (MI) was associated with increased number, activity, and inflammatory status of neutrophils, as indicated by significant increase of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and, interleukin-6 (IL-6). Among the patients with complicated evolution, neutrophil activity had an important prognosis value for diabetics. Neutrophils from patients with unfavorable evolution revealed a pro-inflammatory phenotype with increased expression of CCL3, IL-1β, interleukin-18 (IL-18), S100A9, intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloprotease (MMP-9), of molecules essential in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production p22phox and Nox2, and increased capacity to form neutrophil extracellular traps. Inflammation is associated with adverse short-term prognosis in acute ACS, and inflammatory biomarkers exhibit greater specificity in predicting short-term outcomes in diabetics. Moreover, neutrophils from patients with unfavorable evolution exhibit distinct inflammatory patterns, suggesting that alterations in the innate immune response in this subgroup may exert detrimental effects on disease progression.

The first stars might have been fast rotators. This would have important consequences for their radiative, mechanical, and chemical feedback. We discuss the impact of fast initial rotation on the evolution of massive Population III models and on their nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields. We explore the evolution of Population III stars with initial masses in the range of 9 msol ini msol starting with an initial rotation on the zero-age main sequence equal to 70<!PCT!> of the critical one. We find that with the physics of rotation considered here, our rapidly rotating Population III stellar models do not follow a homogeneous evolution. They lose very little mass in the case in which mechanical winds are switched on when the surface rotation becomes equal to or larger than the critical velocity. The impact on the ionising flux appears to be modest when compared to moderately rotating models. Fast rotation favours, in models with initial masses above sim 20 msol the appearance of a very extended intermediate convective zone around the H-burning shell during the core He-burning phase. This shell has important consequences for the sizes of the He- and CO-cores, and thus impacts the final fate of stars. Moreover, it has a strong impact on nucleosynthesis, boosting the production of primary 14N. Fast initial rotation significantly impacts the chemical feedback of Population III stars. Observations of extremely metal-poor stars and/or starbursting regions are essential to provide constraints on the properties of the first stars.

The pursuit of precise and detailed kinetic characteristics continues to drive advancements in both modeling and measurement methodologies. A multiscale kinetic model was developed to analyze the redox behaviors of the hematite oxygen carrier (OC), characterized by a fluidized bed thermogravimetric analyzer (FB-TGA). This multiscale model integrates bulk diffusion of lattice oxygen, discrete growth of product islands, particle-scale gas diffusion, and interphase gas exchange, offering a comprehensive insight into the evolution of reaction rate and mass transfer. The investigation revealed that the surface diffusion rates of gas molecules are the crucial determinant in the Fe2O3 reactivity, with rapid surface diffusion delaying the formation of an enclosed product layer. The exceptional diffusion conditions and precise weight measurement capability of FB-TGA yielded faster reaction rate constants than conventional methods, facilitating transformative insights into rate-limiting factors. External diffusion and bulk lattice oxygen diffusion were identified as rapid and insufficient in imposing limitations on the overall reaction. Conversely, intraparticle diffusion emerged as the primary rate-limiting step in kinetic experiments even involving 0.1–0.15 mm hematite OC particles, especially during the initial oxidation of Fe3O4, where the mass transfer efficiency dropped below 85%. In actual chemical looping combustion environments utilizing 0.3–0.45 mm hematite OC particles, the resistance of intraparticle diffusion significantly intensified, inhibiting gas–solid reaction rates to an extent comparable to interphase mass transfer. Based on the insights derived from the multiscale model analysis, strategies for optimizing OC particle structure and reactor design have been proposed to enhance gas–solid reactions.

Although the Rare Earth (RE)2Fe14B type magnets were invented in the 1980s and are widely used worldwide. Yet, the phase formation and dissolution mechanisms are still not crystal clear. The reaction dynamics between rare earth elements (REE) and Iron enriched matrix is essential to understand the formation of hard magnetic REE-Fe-B phase or, conversely, phase dissociation and performance degeneration. The development of reaction mechanism is fundamentally important for process engineering and performance manipulation. This work investigates the interface reaction dynamics between REE and Iron enriched matrix via in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The Focused ion beam (FIB) procedure and in-situ STEM experiments are specifically designed to achieve both oxygen-involved and oxygen-free reaction mechanisms within one specimen. The reaction dynamics at high temperatures are frozen to room temperature (RT) by rapid quenching, preserving the solid-liquid interface dynamics between Fe23B6 and liquid phases. Serial atomic resolution STEM images depict lattice evolution while REE atoms embed into the Fe23B6 lattice. The presented work also demonstrates that combining advanced FIB procedure with in-situ annealing & quenching STEM is a powerful tool for investigating high-temperature reaction mechanisms and interface phenomena of the complex system.

Rational reuse of municipal sludge to produce electro-Fenton electrode can not only save resources, but also produce superior peroxide and degradation pollutants simultaneously. Herein, a novel electro-Fenton electrode derived from sludge biochar loaded on Ni foam (SBC@Ni) was constructed via high temperature pyrolysis and chemical coating for efficient H2O2 evolution and pollutant degradation. Systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations (DFT calculation) explained that the production of graphite C and graphite N during high-temperature pyrolysis of municipal sludge can greatly enhance the oxygen reduction reaction of SBC@Ni electrode and promote the evolution of H2O2. And the hybrid heterojunctions, such as FeP, also played a key role in electrocatalytic processes. Notably, the electrode still exhibited excellent performance after 1000 linear scans and 12 hours of continuous current stimulation, which demonstrated the excellent stability of the electrode. Moreover, SBC@Ni electrode can not only effectively oxidize 4-chlorophenol through the electro-Fenton effect, but also fully mineralize organic matter, indicating promising environmental application. The free radical quenching experiment also revealed that the ·OH is the main active species for 4-CP degradation in SBC@Ni electro-Fenton system.

Abstract The exceptional gold mineralisation in quartz pebble conglomerates of the Witwatersrand Basin is attributed to a combination of factors. These factors are linked to the co-evolution of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere, at a very specific time in Archaean geological history and the evolution of the Kaapvaal Craton. Following craton stabilisation and its subaerial emergence, intense chemical weathering and erosion of large volumes of granitoid-greenstone basement released detrital and dissolved gold. Shallow-marine reworking in a long-lived and slowly subsiding basin subjected to episodic compressional deformation and relative sea-level oscillations led to sedimentary concentration of detrital gold. The interaction between acidic, anoxic, and sulfurous surface runoff and more oxidizing marine waters in a near-coastal oxygen oasis supported microbially mediated diagenetic pyrite formation and incorporation of dissolved gold in the pyrite crystal lattice. Erosion and reworking of diagenetic pyrite gave rise to detrital pyrite that characterise most reefs. Abundance of detrital uraninite in conglomerates, derived from erosion of Mesoarchaean granites, and episodes of hydrocarbon migration through sedimentary strata during deep burial set the scene for further enhancement of gold grades in the reefs. Granular and seam pyro-bitumen formed by radiation-induced polymerisation of hydrocarbons around detrital uraninite. Gold dissolved in migrating hydrothermal fluids was then reduced and precipitated upon interaction with the reef pyro-bitumen during hydrothermal placer modification.

Abstract Rattus species are thought to live only at altitudes less than 2500 m, but the Asian house rat ( R. tanezumi ) (RT) has recently expanded to altitudes greater than 3500 m in China. Other Rattus species, especially brown rats ( R. norvegicus ) (RN), still reach only low altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau. Comparative genomics revealed the positive selection of hypoxia‐inducible transcription factors 1 and 2 (HIFs) in RT, with the rapid evolution of HIF pathway genes in RT and Mus musculus (MM) but not RN or R. rattus . Population genomics revealed that genes associated with energy metabolism and oxygen transport were positively selected in RT compared with the other four Rattus species, and two specific substitutions (arginine 31 serine and leucine 33 methionine) were identified in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) in RT. The above results suggested that RT possesses unique genetic adaptations to hypoxia, which was further confirmed by behavioral experiments on RT and RN. Normobaric hypoxia significantly reduced locomotion in RN but not in RT. Moreover, through intraspecific transcriptome analysis, the expression of Hbb and genes related to angiogenesis, oxygen transport, and glycolysis was upregulated, and the expression of genes associated with immunological functions in the liver, lungs, and/or sperm was downregulated in RT compared to those in RN. Interspecific transcriptome analysis further revealed that HIF‐1α plays a role in modulating the hypoxic adaptation of RT rather than RN. Our work provides genomic, behavioral, and physiological insights into why RT, but not other Rattus species, could invade the Tibetan Plateau.

Abstract Rhenium (Re) and uranium (U) are essential proxies in reconstructing past oceanic oxygenation evolution. However, their removal in continental shelf sediments, hotspots of early diagenesis, were previously treated as quantitatively unimportant sinks in the ocean. Here we examine the sedimentary reductive removal of Re and U and their coupling with organic carbon decomposition, utilizing the 224 Ra/ 228 Th disequilibria within the East China Sea shelf. We identified positive correlations between their removal fluxes and the rates of sediment oxygen consumption or organic carbon decomposition. These correlations enable an evaluation of global shelf reductive sinks that are comparable to (for Re) or higher than (~4-fold for U) previously established suboxic/anoxic sinks. These findings suggest potential imbalances in the modern budgets of Re and U, or perhaps a substantial underestimation of their sources. Our study thus highlights shelf sedimentary reductive removal as critical yet overlooked sinks for Re and U in the modern ocean.

Ni-rich LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2 (NCM) layered oxides are low-cost high-energy density cathode materials, but plagued by its poor thermal stability incurred safety concerns. The thermal failure process of the layered cathode is accompanied by heat generation and oxygen release, which drives the battery into thermal runaway (TR). Aiming to fully understand the TR process and the structure evolution, this work applies diverse characterization techniques onto a polycrystalline Ni-rich layered cathode (LiNi0.83Mn0.05Co0.12O2 (PCN83)) to comprehensively investigate its thermal failure process at multiple scales. From macro level, we validate that it is the cathode thermal failure that drives the battery from the heat accumulation stage into TR in adiabatic conditions. From micro level, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) verifies that the thermal failure of PCN83 starts from 150 °C, which is much lower than the TR temperature measured from macro level tests. We reveal that the PCN83 cathode experiences sequential phase transitions before the TR, where the phase transition mechanism is illustrated from the atomic scale and the pore evolution process is unraveled. In situ heating TEM further reveals that thermal failure is preferentially initiated from grain boundaries and defect regions. These findings provide an in-depth understanding of the whole thermal failure process of NMC-based layered cathode materials and sheds new lights on the rational design of Ni-rich cathode materials with improved thermal safety.

Among the advanced reactor designs of the fourth generation, the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) stands out as one of six distinct types. The corrosion caused by the liquid Lead-Bismuth Eutectic (LBE) on structural materials is recognized as a significant obstacle hindering the development of LFR. The corrosion kinetics of T91 steel in static LBE with 10-7 wt% oxygen at 500 ºC is analyzed in this study. The formed oxide scale consists of an outer (Fe, Cr)3O4 layer with a Fe-Cr spinel structure and an inner internal oxidation zone (IOZ). The thickness evolution of the oxide layers follows a parabolic rule, with rate constants determined for different layers. The dissolution rate of metals into the LBE decreases over time, indicating diminishing the concentration gradient of Fe across the oxide layer-LBE interface. The observed deviations from expected norms may be attributed to dynamic flow conditions and non-isothermal loop experiments, which accelerate Fe diffusion into LBE.

Discovering affordable, high-performance, and stable catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of clean hydrogen technology. In this study, we utilized a high-throughput screening approach combined with electronic structure descriptors to identify new intermetallic catalysts that minimize noble metal contents while maintaining high performance and stability. We screened 2,358 binary and ternary intermetallic compounds constructed from 31 common transition metal elements. From the 462 bulk compositions that are synthetically accessible, we enumerated all possible low-Miller-index surfaces (12,057 surfaces in total) with density functional theory calculations. Seven electronic-structure-based descriptors are then applied to pinpoint aqueously stable surfaces offering performance comparable to the renowned Pt (111) and Ir (111) surfaces. This process led to the identification of several previously known noble-metal-containing catalysts, as well as a selection of new intermetallic catalysts.

The air electrode with strontium and cobalt elements has the elemental diffusion or delamination issue on the air electrode/electrolyte interface in reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs). Hence the development of strontium and cobalt-free triple conducting (H+/O2-/e-) air electrodes with high electrochemical activity and stability is urgent. Here, we report a strontium and cobalt-free Ba0.8Ca0.2FeO3-δ (BCF82) air electrode with high catalytic activity and electrochemical stability for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. A RPCC with the BCF82 air electrode shows a high peak power density of 1.14 W cm-2 in the fuel cell mode and a current density of 3.49 A cm-2 under 1.3 V in the electrolysis mode at 700 °C. Furthermore, the cell demonstrates suitable stability in the fuel cell, electrolysis and reversible modes at 600 °C for hundreds of hours without elemental segregation and delamination issue. This work offers an efficient approach to develop low-cost and durable air electrodes for RPCCs.

Monocytes (Mos) are crucial in the evolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and immunometabolism studies have recently suggested targeting leukocyte bioenergetics in inflammatory diseases. Here, we reveal a peculiar bioenergetic phenotype in circulating Mos of patients with MASH, characterized by high levels of glycolysis and mitochondrial (mt) respiration. The enhancement of mt respiratory chain activity, especially complex II (succinate dehydrogenase [SDH]), is unbalanced toward the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is sustained at the transcriptional level with the involvement of the AMPK-mTOR-PGC-1α axis. The modulation of mt activity with dimethyl malonate (DMM), an SDH inhibitor, restores the metabolic profile and almost abrogates cytokine production. Analysis of a public single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset confirms that in murine models of MASH, liver Mo-derived macrophages exhibit an upregulation of mt and glycolytic energy pathways. Accordingly, the DMM injection in MASH mice contrasts Mo infiltration and macrophagic enrichment, suggesting immunometabolism as a potential target in MASH.

Abstract While understanding the competitive adsorption behavior of gas sensor is important, it is yet to be unraveled. Especially for the influence of water molecules to the gas adsorbed on 2D materials. This study explores the potential of layered 2D materials as a candidate material for gas sensing, employing non‐destructive measurement, and second harmonic generation (SHG). The investigation focuses on analyzing oxygen, ammonia, and water vapor adsorbed on a WS 2 surface by studying the evolutions in electric dipole and electric field. Leveraging the simplified bond hyperpolarizability model (SBHM), a foundation is established for gas sensors utilizing high‐quality 2D materials. This approach facilitates the detection of material modifications in response to environmental influences, including the inevitable water molecules. The obtained hyperpolarizability from SBHM exhibits remarkable consistency with Langmuir's adsorption model, confirming the physical adsorption in the system. In addition, the competitive effects between gases are explored by comparing experimental results with theoretical predictions based on Boltzmann distribution and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This highlights the effectiveness of SHG and SBHM in studying gas adsorption on layered van der Waals materials.

Millisecond pulsars with white dwarf companions have typical eccentricities $e\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-3}$. The eccentricities of helium white dwarfs are explained well by applying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to convective eddies in their red giant progenitors. We extend this theory to more massive carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs with asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitors. Due to the radiation pressure in AGB stars, the dominant factor in determining the remnant white dwarf's eccentricity is the critical residual hydrogen envelope mass $m_{\rm env}$ required to inflate the star to giant proportions. Using a suite of MESA stellar evolution simulations with $\Delta m_{\rm c}=10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ core-mass intervals, we resolved the AGB thermal pulses and found that the critical $m_{\rm env}\propto m_{\rm c}^{-6}$. This steep dependence causes the $e(m_{\rm c})$ relation to turn over, such that $e\sim 3\times 10^{-3}$ almost independently of the remnant CO white dwarf's mass $m_{\rm c}$. Nearly all of the measured eccentricities lie below this robust theoretical limit, indicating that the eccentricity is damped during the common-envelope inspiral that follows the unstable Roche-lobe overflow of the AGB star. Specifically, we focused on white dwarfs with median masses $m_{\rm c}>0.6\,{\rm M}_\odot$. These massive white dwarfs begin their inspiral with practically identical orbital periods and eccentricities, eliminating any dependence on the initial conditions. For this sub-sample, we find an empirical relation $e\propto P^{3/2}$ between the final period and eccentricity that is much tighter than previous studies - motivating theoretical work on the eccentricity evolution during the common envelope phase.

The roles of crack channel transitions and thermally grown oxides (TGO) in the failure of environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) should be clarified. Hence, in this study, the laws of penetration and delamination crack evolution were investigated using a virtual crack extension method for multilayer materials to gain insights into the transformation conditions with a framework for a coupled thermal/mechanical/chemical numerical model of TGO containing channel cracks developed based on this law. The framework integrates diffusion, TGO growth, and phase transformation of the oxides. A theoretical model for high-temperature gas corrosion of EBCs coupled with deformation, mass diffusion, and chemical reactions was proposed, with the results indicating that the cracks transitioned from vertical to exfoliation cracks in the ytterbium dibasic silicate (YbDS) layer. The coupling effect of cracks and stresses led to non-uniform growth of the TGO by affecting the oxygen diffusion and inflow rates. The y-direction stresses at the YbDS/TGO interface near the crack channel changed from compressive to tensile stresses after cooling, making the first location to undergo delamination failure. The proposed model can provide better guidance for designing EBCs systems and supporting the life prediction of EBCs in service environments.

Abstract:: In recent years, research and development efforts have been heavily focused on conductive diamond electrodes for electrochemical applications. Such initiatives may have been spurred by their broad potential window, low background current, chemical inertness, and mechanical robustness. Compared to other carbon-based materials, conducting diamond can oxidize several analytes before the breakdown of water in aqueous electrolytes. Since the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen does not obstruct the analysis, this is significant for the detection and/or identification of species in solution. As a result, conductive diamond electrodes expand the application of electrochemical detection and make it possible to use them for analytes that are incompatible with traditional electrode materials. Fabricating boron-doped diamond films via chemical vapor deposition on different substrates is of special interest. This article highlights the therapeutic and electroanalytical applications of boron-doped diamond electrodes in various aspects in addition to the synthetic strategies to obtain Boron Doped Diamond Electrodes (BDDE), the cost-effectiveness of BDD and its in-vivo compatibility that will help the analytical researchers to learn almost everything about the previous studies done on BDDE and encourage them to work more efficiently in this research field.

Aluminium is one of the most abundant metals in the universe and impacts the evolution of various astrophysical environments. Currently detected Al‐bearing molecules represent only a small fraction of the aluminium budget, suggesting that aluminium may reside in other species. AlO and AlOH molecules are abundant in the oxygen‐rich supergiant stars such as VY Canis Majoris, a stellar molecular factory with 60+ molecules including the prebiotic NC‐bearing species. Additional Al‐bearing molecules with N, C, O, and H may form in O‐rich environments with radiation‐accelerated chemistry. Here, we present spectroscopic identification of novel aluminium‐bearing molecules composed of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] from the reactions of Al atoms and HNCO in solid argon matrix, which are potential Al‐bearing molecules in space. Photoinduced transformations among six [Al, N, C, O, H] isomers and three [Al, N, C, O] isomers, along with their dissociation reactions forming the known interstellar species, have been disclosed. These results provide new insight into the chemical network of astronomically detected Al‐bearing species in space.

Developing a novel high-efficiency coal combustion technology with ultra-low NOx emission is urgently needed to sustain the good ecological environment. Here, the targeted regulation of local microenvironment around fuel-N, such as functional groups, radicals, molecular configurations, and reaction atmosphere, is realized by the selective oxidation. The molecular configurations, including pore networks and microcrystalline structure in coal, are well characterized through synchrotron radiation-induced SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) and WAXS (wide angle X-ray scattering) simultaneously. Furthermore, by combining density functional theory (DFT) and experiments, the effects of the local microenvironment on the nitrogen transformation and NO evolution during the thermal conversion are focused on. The results indicate that for the PPA oxidation, the H radicals attack the adjacent carbon to pyrrole/pyridine nitrogen, promoting the conversion of fuel-N to HCN. On the other hand, for the H2O2 oxidation, disrupting the π bond electron cloud by the CO and C = O on the ortho carbon of pyrrole/pyridine dominates the NH3 generation. Additionally, the increased La (average graphene layer extent), a3 (average interlayer spacing), σ3 (standard deviation of interlayer spacing) and σ1 (standard deviation of the first-neighbor distribution) induce massive smaller pores, promoting the generation of abundant reaction defects inside the particles. Importantly, the intensified adsorption on abundant active sites lead to the decreased HCN and increased NH3 evolution, which is adverse for the interaction between homogeneous and heterogeneous NO reduction. Interestingly, the PAA selective oxidation can reduce NO emission by 31.72 % - 34.30 % during the air combustion, which is far better than the H2O2 oxidation. Overall, the attack of free radicals on nitrogen-containing heterocycles promotes the conversion of fuel-N to HCN, the adsorption of which on char surfaces can further enhance the heterogeneous reduction in a lean oxygen atmosphere. The work here provides a novel route for developing high-efficiency and low-NOx combustion technologies.

Summary Some cyanobacteria can grow photoautotrophically or photomixotrophically by using simultaneously CO 2 and glucose. The switch between these trophic modes and the role of glycogen, their main carbon storage macromolecule, was investigated. We analysed the effect of glucose addition on the physiology, metabolic and photosynthetic state of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and mutants lacking phosphoglucomutase and ADP‐glucose pyrophosphorylase, with limitations in glycogen synthesis. Glycogen acted as a metabolic buffer: glucose addition increased growth and glycogen reserves in the wild‐type (WT), but arrested growth in the glycogen synthesis mutants. Already 30 min after glucose addition, metabolites from the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate shunt increased threefold more in the glycogen synthesis mutants than the WT. These alterations substantially affected the photosynthetic performance of the glycogen synthesis mutants, as O 2 evolution and CO 2 uptake were both impaired. We conclude that glycogen synthesis is essential during transitions to photomixotrophy to avoid metabolic imbalance that induces inhibition of electron transfer from PSII and subsequently accumulation of reactive oxygen species, loss of PSII core proteins, and cell death. Our study lays foundations for optimising photomixotrophy‐based biotechnologies through understanding the coordination of the crosstalk between photosynthetic electron transport and metabolism.

The conserved microRNA (miRNA) miR408 enhances photosynthesis and compromises stress tolerance in multiple plants, but the cellular mechanism underlying its function remains largely unclear. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the transcript encoding the blue copper protein PLANTACYANIN (PCY) is the primary target for miR408 in vegetative tissues. PCY is preferentially expressed in the guard cells, and PCY is associated with the endomembrane surrounding individual chloroplasts. We found that the MIR408 promoter is suppressed by multiple abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factors, thus allowing PCY to accumulate under stress conditions. Genetic analysis revealed that PCY elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the guard cells, promotes stomatal closure, reduces photosynthetic gas exchange, and enhances drought resistance. Moreover, the miR408-PCY module is sufficient to rescue the growth and drought tolerance phenotypes caused by gain- and loss-of-function of MYB44, an established positive regulator of ABA responses, indicating that the miR408-PCY module relays ABA signaling for regulating ROS homeostasis and drought resistance. These results demonstrate that miR408 regulates stomatal movement to balance growth and drought resistance, providing a mechanistic understanding of why miR408 is selected during land plant evolution and insights into the long-pursued quest of breeding drought-tolerant and high-yielding crops.

Titanium/steel joints are widely used in petrochemical, nuclear and aerospace industries. The lapped sequence of dissimilar metal lapped joints can considerably affect their mechanical and corrosion properties. In the study, the microstructure and corrosion behavior of pure titanium/galvanized steel dissimilar cold metal transfer welding joints with different lapped sequences were investigated using microscopic examination, immersion and electrochemical corrosion tests. Pure titanium/galvanized steel joints can be defined as Ti/steel joint (the Ti sheet on top of the steel sheet) or steel/Ti joint (the steel sheet on top of the Ti sheet). The results showed that the corrosion resistance of the Ti/steel joint was poorer than that of the steel/Ti joint in artificial seawater solution because of the formation of larger intermetallics in the weld metal of the Ti/steel joint. Galvanic corrosion occurred in both the Ti/steel and steel/Ti joints. The interface between the galvanized steel base metal and weld metal was the weakest zone in both joints. Moreover, the corrosion mechanisms of the Ti/steel and steel/Ti joints were similar, the reactions were the reduction of oxygen and the evolution of H2 at the cathode. Anodic reactions included the oxidation of metal ions, the formation of TiO2 oxide film and the oxidation of the intermetallics. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the corrosion behavior of titanium/steel lapped joints under artificial seawater conditions.

The tunability of the Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) properties has gained attention from numerous researchers due to their wide application in various fields including quantum technology. In the present work, WS2 has been deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and its properties have been studied systematically. These samples were irradiated using gamma radiation for various doses, and the effect on structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties has been reported. The crystallinity of the material is observed to be decreased, and the results are well supported by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy techniques. The increase in grain boundaries has been supported by the agglomeration observed in the scanning electron microscopy micrographs. The XPS results of WS2 after gamma irradiation show evolution of oxygen, carbon, C=O, W-O and SO42- peaks, confirming the addition of impurities and formation of point defect. The gamma irradiation creates point defects, and their density increases considerably with increasing gamma dosage. These defects crucially altered the structural, optical and electrical properties of the material. The reduction in the optical band gap with increased gamma irradiation is evident from the absorption spectra and respective Tauc plots. The I-V graphs show a 1000-fold increase in the saturation current after 100 kGy gamma irradiation dose. This work has explored the gamma irradiation effect on the WS2 and suggests substantial modification in the material and enhancement in electrical properties. .

Background: Acute leukemia is the result of clonal transformation and proliferation of a hematopoietic progenitor giving rise to poorly differentiated neoplastic cells. Reactive oxygen species play a role in maintaining the quiescence, self-renewal, and long-term survival of hematopoietic stem cells, but it is unclear how they would affect disease onset and progression. The aim is to evaluate, at the transcriptional and systemic level, the oxidative-inflammatory status in newly diagnosis acute leukemia patients. Methods: Seventy acute leukemia patients [26 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 13 Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), and 31 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)] and forty-one healthy controls were analyzed. Malondialdehyde and catalase activity were evaluated. Gene expression of NRF2, SOD, PRDX2, CAT, IL-6, and TNF-α was analyzed by real-time PCR. Results: Malondialdehyde concentration was similar in all groups studied. Catalase activity was significantly higher in AML and APL patients compared to controls, while ALL showed similar activity to the healthy group. NRF2, CAT, and PRDX2 expression levels were similar between groups, SOD expression was downregulated in all acute leukemia patients. TNF-α expression was lower in AML groups than in healthy individuals, and IL-6 mRNA expression was downregulated in ALL and APL. Conclusion: This is the first report that correlates transcriptional and systemic parameters associated with the oxidative inflammatory status in newly diagnosed acute leukemia. Some of the parameters evaluated could be used as biomarkers in the selection of an effective therapeutic strategy and will open new directions for the follow-up and evolution of this disease.

Human gut antibiotic resistome widely occur in anoxic environments characterized by high density of bacterial cells and frequent transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Such resistome is greatly diluted, degraded, and restrained in the aerobic habitats within most natural rivers (regarded as "terrestrial guts") connecting continents and the oceans. Here we implemented a large-scale monitoring campaign extending 5,200 km along the Yellow River, and provide the first integral biogeographic pattern for both ARGs and their hosts. We identified plentiful ARGs (24 types and 809 subtypes) and their hosts (24 phyla and 757 MAGs) in three media (water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment). Unexpectedly, we found diverse human gut bacteria (HGB) acting as supercarriers of ARGs in this oxygen-rich river. We further discovered that numerous microhabitats were created within stratified biofilms that surround SPMs, particularly regarding the aggregation of anaerobic HGB. These microhabitats provide numerous ideal sinks for anaerobic bacteria and facilitate horizontal transfer of ARGs within the stratified biofilms, Furthermore, the stratification of biofilms surrounding SPMs has facilitated synergy between human gut flora and denitrifiers for propagation of ARGs in the anoxic atmospheres, leading to high occurrence of human gut antibiotic resistome. SPMs play active roles in the dynamic interactions of river water and sediment, thus accelerating the evolution of riverine resistome and transmission of human gut antibiotic resistome. This study revealed the special contribution of SPMs to the propagation of ARGs, and highlighted the necessity of making alternative strategies for sustainable management of large rivers with hyper-concentrated sediment-laden flows.

The unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) from Cyclocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) can selectively oxidize C-H bonds using hydrogen peroxide as an oxygen donor without cofactors, which has drawn significant industrial attention. Many studies have made efforts to enhance the overall activity of AaeUPO expressed in Komagataella phaffii by employing strategies such as enzyme-directed evolution, utilizing appropriate promoters, and screening secretion peptides. Building upon these previous studies, the objective of this study was to further enhance the expression of a mutant of AaeUPO with improved activity (PaDa-I) by increasing the gene copy number, co-expressing chaperones, and optimizing culture conditions. Our results demonstrated that a strain carrying approximately three copies of expression cassettes and co-expressing the protein disulfide isomerase showed an approximately 10.7-fold increase in volumetric enzyme activity, using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as the substrate. After optimizing the culture conditions, the volumetric enzyme activity of this strain further increased by approximately 48.7%, reaching 117.3 U/mL. Additionally, the purified catalytic domain of PaDa-I displayed regioselective hydroxylation of R-2-phenoxypropionic acid. The results of this study may facilitate the industrial application of UPOs. KEY POINTS: • The secretion of the catalytic domain of PaDa-I can be significantly enhanced through increasing gene copy numbers and co-expressing of protein disulfide isomerase. • After optimizing the culture conditions, the volumetric enzyme activity can reach 117.3 U/mL, using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as the substrate. • The R-2-phenoxypropionic acid can undergo the specific hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by catalytic domain of PaDa-I, resulting in the formation of R-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionic acid.

Cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) play many important roles during plant development, including defense responses under both biotic and abiotic stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, callose deposition and programmed cell death (PCD). However, there are few studies on the involvement of the CRK family in male sterility due to heat stress in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, a genome-wide characterization of the CRK family was performed to investigate the structural and functional attributes of the wheat CRKs in anther sterility caused by heat stress. A total of 95 CRK genes were unevenly distributed on 18 chromosomes, with the most genes distributed on chromosome 2B. Paralogous homologous genes with Ka/Ks ratios less than 1 may have undergone strong purifying selection during evolution and are more functionally conserved. The collinearity analysis results of CRK genes showed that wheat and Arabidopsis ( A. thaliana ), foxtail millet, Brachypodium distachyon ( B. distachyon ), and rice have three, 12, 15, and 11 pairs of orthologous genes, respectively. In addition, the results of the network interactions of genes and miRNAs showed that five miRNAs were in the hub of the interactions map, namely tae-miR9657b-5p, tae-miR9780, tae-miR9676-5p, tae-miR164, and tae-miR531. Furthermore, qRT-PCR validation of the six TaCRK genes showed that they play key roles in the development of the mononuclear stage anthers, as all six genes were expressed at highly significant levels in heat-stressed male sterile mononuclear stage anthers compared to normal anthers. We hypothesized that the TaCRK gene is significant in the process of high-temperature-induced sterility in wheat based on the combination of anther phenotypes, paraffin sections, and qRT-PCR data. These results improve our understanding of their relationship.

Cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX) materials have recently garnered attention for their potential as cathodes in lithiumion batteries.These materials are lithium transition metal oxides which assume a rocksalt type structure with a disordering of the lithium and one or more transition metals on the cation sublattice.The disordering results in several desirable properties such as good lithium transport and small volume changes with cycling.Unlike layered transition metal oxides that are inherently unstable when significant lithium is removed, limiting practical compositions to combinations of cobalt, nickel, and manganese, DRX cathodes can also be synthesized with widely available transition metals to avoid expensive or critical materials.[1]Additional fluorine substitution for oxygen can increase stability for higher lithium content and improve long term capacity retention during cycling.[2,3]Solid-state synthesis, where solid precursors are mixed together, sometimes through ball-milling, then heated either in air or inert gas to high temperatures (typically ~1000˚C), has been one of the chief methods for fabricating disordered or partially disordered cathod e materials.For solid-state synthesis, the reaction can go through multiple intermediates before the reaction is completed.These intermediates are not always known and could be desirable end products in themselves, however, without in situ methods, only the endpoints of the synthesis can be studied.X-ray diffraction is a powerful approach for tracking crystalline structures in situ during solid state synthesis.At the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), we have used in situ X-ray diffraction to study the solidstate synthesis of disordered rocksalt cathode materials.After careful preparation of the precursor mixture, it is possible to monitor the reaction as the sample is heated to and held at the reaction temperature.From this data it is possible to monitor the phase evolution of the precursors and the formation of the disordered rocksalt product.This in situ data provides important mechanistic insight into the formation reaction of the disordered rocksalt material and allows for easy determination of the impact of changes to the precursor materials or the annealing process.In combination with detailed structural characterization of the product ex situ, we accurately determine the final product composition, level of order/disorder, and performance as a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a species of small freshwater fish native to South Asia belonging to the minnow family, Cyprinidae. Zebrafish are typically used as experimental organism due to its small size, short generation time and the availability of a well-characterized genome. In biomedical research, zebrafish are commonly employed as model organism due to their genetic similarities to humans (sharing 70-80% of their genes) and their rapid development. Zebrafish model have several advantages over other modeling of human diseases such as large-scale genetic mutants, therapeutic compounds screening, live imaging, and tissue specific transgenic animal generation. The zebrafish is an invaluable model for studying development and organogenesis due to external fertilization and the transparency of larvae is best suited for studying early stages of development (Carten et al. 2011, Li and Luo 2013b). The option to generate transgenic and mutant lines makes zebrafish suitable for studying the genetic and molecular basis of physiological processes such as metabolism, excretion and endocrinology. In addition, zebrafish has been used to study the effects of environmental pollutants and to investigate the effects of environmental stress on physiology, such as changes in temperature, pH and oxygen levels. Zebrafish is also a perfect model for studying the effects of natural selection and adaptation, as it is capable of rapid evolution in response to environmental change. Zebrafish larvae can be readily infected with a variety of bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens, making them useful for studying infection biology. In early 1980s, George Streisinger used zebrafish as the first biological model due to its simplicity over mouse models since they were easy to manipulate genetically (Streisinger et al. 1981). Zebrafish models are used to study a wide variety of human diseases, including developmental disorder, metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disorders, inflammation, cancer, ageing, and neurological disorders (Li and Luo 2013b, Rahman Khan and Sulaiman Alhewairini 2019, Fazio et al. 2020, Zanandrea et al. 2020, Choi et al. 2021).

We present determinations of the gas-phase and stellar metallicities of a sample of 65 star-forming galaxies at $z \simeq 3.5$ using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy from the VANDELS survey in combination with follow-up rest-frame optical spectroscopy from VLT/KMOS and Keck/MOSFIRE. We infer gas-phase oxygen abundances ($Z_{\mathrm{g}}$; tracing O/H) via strong optical nebular lines and stellar iron abundances ($Z_{\star}$; tracing Fe/H) from full spectral fitting to the FUV continuum. Our sample spans the stellar mass range $8.5 < \mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) < 10.5$ and shows clear evidence for both a stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that our O and Fe abundance estimates both exhibit a similar mass-dependence, such that $\mathrm{Fe/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.30\pm0.11}$ and $\mathrm{O/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.32\pm0.09}$. At fixed $M_{\star}$ we find that, relative to their solar values, O abundances are systematically larger than Fe abundances (i.e., $\alpha$-enhancement).We estimate an average enhancement of $\mathrm{(O/Fe)} = 2.65 \pm 0.16 \times \mathrm{(O/Fe)_\odot}$ which appears to be independent of $M_{\star}$. We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place a novel constraint on the strength of galactic-level outflows via the mass-outflow factor ($\eta$). We show that outflow efficiencies that scale as $\eta \propto M_{\star}^{-0.32}$ can simultaneously explain the functional form of of the stellar and gas-phase MZR, as well as the degree of $\alpha$-enhancement at fixed Fe/H. Our results add further evidence to support a picture in which $\alpha$-enhanced abundance ratios are ubiquitous in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, as expected for young systems whose interstellar medium is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae.

Abstract Funding Acknowledgements None. Background Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) are the leading cause of mortality in Spain. Further research is needed in order to know risk factors and outcomes in young patients so that medicians could optimize their management and prevention. Purpose Identifying risk factors, clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes in Acute Coronary Syndrome in patients aged 40 and under. Methods A retrospective analysis of patients under 40 years of age who were admitted for ACS, out of 3,859 ACS admissions in Cardiology Intensive Care Unit (CICU) in our hospital between 2012 and 2022. Results 67 patients (1.73%) were included, most of them were males (83.6%). Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. 77.6% had hypertension (HTA), 22.4% had diabetes (DM) and 34.3% had dyslipidemia (DLP). 79.1% were smokers, 9.1% had a history of alcoholism and 29.9% were cocaine users. None of them had a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF). Only 3% had ischemic heart disease. 68.7% of them were ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and inferior STEMI was the most common (38.7%). In anterior STEMI (22 patients), 15 had a severe lesion in the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD), and 6 in the left main stem (LM). Single-vessel disease was the most common (70.8%), with 3-vessel disease in 4.6%. 75.8% received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and 3% underwent bypass surgery. During admission, 10.5% progressed to Killip class III-IV. The ICU mortality was 1.5%. 9% received vasoactive drugs and 4.5% were intubated. Non-invasive ventilation was used in 3% and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in 5.3%. 3% received intra-aortic balloon pump support and 1.5% underwent dialysis or ultrafiltration. 4.5% received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), although none of them developed bundle branch block or atrioventricular node block, nor AF. After discharge, 11.1% had recurrent ACS, and up to 5.6% underwent PCI again, with a mortality rate of 11.8%. Conclusion Approximately 2% of ACS occur in people younger than 40 years of age. Substance abuse (smoking, cocaine and alcoholism) becomes more prevalent in this group. Prevalence of comorbidities (such as diabetes and nephropathy) are lower, making them less prone to short-term heart failure. However, they are more susceptible to recurrent ischemic events. There is a high incidence of inferior STEMI and LM-STEMI. For these reasons, medicians may need to find out a substance abuse in this group and further research into other risk factors, such as coronary disease family history.Basal characteristicsClinical evolution of patients

Nitrogen (N) is unique amongst the bioessential elements in that its major reservoir is in the atmosphere, as triple-bonded N2, which comprises 78% of the atmosphere. Breaking the extremely strong triple bond of N2 is challenging; in nature, only the microbial nitrogenase enzyme is known to be capable of this reaction, and nitrogenase is by far the dominant source of N2 fixation on the modern Earth. Abiotic N2 fixation is found only in extremely high energy situations, namely lightning bolts, and industrial N2 fixation for fertilizer production. Indeed, N is one of the elemental cycles most influenced by human activities; in a little over a century, humans have more than doubled fixed N2 in the environment due to industrial N2 fixation via the Haber–Bosch process. Excess fertilizer use and subsequent runoff contributes to eutrophication of waterways and emissions of greenhouse gases, namely nitrous oxide. While humans have radically changed the N cycle in the Anthropocene, it was single-celled microorganisms that established the nitrogen cycle and its enzymatic processes over Earth's history [1.Stüeken E.E. et al.The evolution of Earth's biogeochemical nitrogen cycle.Earth Sci. Rev. 2016; 160: 220-239Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. Once fixed into 'reactive' N (the term for all forms of N in the environment except N2), N cycles through dozens of inorganic and organic nitrogenous forms on the Earth's surface [2.Zhang X. et al.Global nitrogen cycle: critical enzymes, organisms, and processes for nitrogen budgets and dynamics.Chem. Rev. 2020; 120: 5308-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar]. With every passing year, it becomes clearer that the so-called N cycle, often drawn as a circle, is instead a tangled web. While relatively stable chemical species like nitrate and ammonium are often the focus of attention, highly reactive intermediates – such as nitric oxide, hydroxylamine, and even hydrazine (rocket fuel) – are increasingly recognized as the linchpins in the N web but often experience cryptic cycling due to their reactivity. Even more complexity is introduced when one considers the fact that the N web is woven by biotic–abiotic couplings, such as chemodenitrification, in which products of microbial metabolism react with ferrous iron to produce gaseous N. Biotic transformations in the N cycle are primarily catalyzed by metalloenzymes, many of which contain iron, molybdenum, and/or copper cofactors [3.Lycus P. et al.Structural biology of proteins involved in nitrogen cycling.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2023; 74102278Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. For instance, alternative forms of nitrogenase (vanadium–iron or iron–iron) have been detected, but they are rare in natural environments. Intriguingly, molybdenum–iron nitrogenase is by far the dominant form, even in environments in which vanadium is present at higher concentrations than molybdenum [4.Warren M.J. et al.Molybdenum-based diazotrophy in a sphagnum peatland in northern Minnesota.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2017; 83e01174–17Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar]. In some environments, such as the low-chlorophyll, high-nitrate regions of the oceans, scarcity of trace metals, particularly iron, limits photosynthesis and nitrate assimilation by phytoplankton. Scientific disciplines separate the N cycle/web into soil, freshwater, marine, and anthropogenic compartments; microbial life, of course, ignores all such designations and N freely flows across such artificial boundaries. While challenging, enhanced communication across disciplinary spheres is vital for expediting scientific discoveries and applications. Towards that end, Trends in Microbiology has joined forces with iScience to present a special issue on 'Nitrogen Cycling Across Environments' that explores microbial N processes across aquatic and terrestrial environments, with a focus on lessons that can be gained from cross-communication across the fields. The N cycle is replete with examples of how processes discovered in one environment have informed another. This is particularly common in the study of wastewater engineering, in which a large priority is conversion of reactive N from human and animal waste to N gas while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, also known as biological N removal [5.Winkler M.K. Straka L. New directions in biological nitrogen removal and recovery from wastewater.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2019; 57: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar]. Anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (anammox) was first characterized in samples of wastewater sludge but has since been discovered in soil as well. More recently, the pathway of complete nitrification, thus far restricted to terrestrial environments, was discovered in other samples from engineered, aquatic systems. Crosstalk between fields can also bring new ideas about potential interactions between species in the N cycle. Interactions between diazotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes in root nodules (e.g., in legumes and alder trees) have long been studied in soils but remained relatively unknown in the ocean until the discovery of UCYN-A unicellular cyanobacteria in symbiosis with haptophyte algae. Likewise, while non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs have long been known to be key for terrestrial N2 fixation, they were only relatively recently discovered in the ocean. The role of viruses in the nitrogen cycle remains understudied across ecosystems. Many technological challenges hinder progress, such as challenges cultivating and genetic systems for environmentally key species and applying limited rate measurements across scales. Methods for microbial cultivation and pathway characterization are increasingly complex, which poses problems for widespread access to study of the cycle. This special issue tackles these questions and more. Three of the articles focus on the entry of N into the cycle via N2 fixation catalyzed by nitrogenase. Chakraborty et al. discuss engineering N2-fixing bacteria to increase N yield to crops, Zehr and Capone highlight recent developments and challenges in marine N2 fixation research, and Rucker and Kaçar describe interconnections between metal cycles and N cycles. Bowen et al. highlight salt marshes as an interface between terrestrial and marine realms, both subject to anthropogenic disturbances, which remove excess N prior to its entry into marine habitats. Deutsch and colleagues tackle the temperature dependence of biological N2 fixation and uncover a relationship that is similar across terrestrial and marine environments. Beeckman et al. critically examine the role of nitrification inhibitors that are used to relieve the deleterious effects associated with excess nitrification, providing insights into their applicability in the field. Saghaï and Hallin review ammonifiers in terrestrial and aquatic environments. The article looks at enzymes involved in the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to ammonia with a particular focus on the widely used marker, NrfA. The special issue also highlights two recently published articles on the influence of tillage practices on the rhizosphere [6.Behr J.H. et al.Long-term conservation tillage with reduced nitrogen fertilization intensity can improve winter wheat health via positive plant–microorganism feedback in the rhizosphere.FEMS Microb. Ecol. 2024; 100fiae003Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar] and the identification of Methylomirabilis bacterium capable of methane-dependent complete denitrification [7.Yao X. et al.Methane-dependent complete denitrification by a single Methylomirabilis bacterium.Nat. Microbiol. 2024; 9: 464-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. Finally, our Microbe of the Month for this special issue is the diazotrophic Gram-negative bacterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum (diazoefficiens), covered by Ong and O'Brian. We would also like to draw your attention to the articles published in iScience that are part of this interdisciplinary collection (https://www.cell.com/cp/collections-microbial-nitrogen-transformation). Christensen and Rousk review global sources of N2O emissions, identifying those which are influenced by anthropogenic activities, and highlighting agricultural systems with the potential for mitigation. Derikvand and colleagues focus on the microbial ecology of engineered aquaponic systems, investigating microbial community dynamics and ammonia removal in response to ammonia-oxidizing inocula and changing pH. While dozens of microbial reactions in the N cycle have been discovered, many more exergonic and disproportionation reactions, and the enzymes that catalyze them, await unearthing [8.Kuypers M.M.M. et al.The microbial nitrogen-cycling network.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar]. Crystal structures of membrane proteins such as ammonia monooxygenase have been notoriously difficult to solve but are essential for mechanistic understanding of nitrogen cycle processes [9.Bradely B.T. et al.Integrated structural biology and molecular ecology of N-cycling enzymes from ammonia-oxidizing archaea.Environ. Microbiol. 2017; 5: 484-491Google Scholar]. Forms of oxygen-resistant enzymes previously thought to be extremely oxygen sensitive have also been discovered, such as the atypical form of nitrous oxide reductase, and surely many more remain to be found [10.Simon J. Klotz M.G. Diversity and evolution of bioenergetic systems involved in microbial nitrogen compound transformations.BBA-Bioenergetics. 2013; 2: 114-135Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar]. As we venture even further into the Anthropocene, the importance of studying N cycling across environments subject to global climate change becomes ever more important. Nitrogen is a bioessential element with an almost limitless supply from the atmosphere, yet conversion to reactive N currently relies on fossil fuels and results in eutrophication and greenhouse emissions. Harnessing insights from microbes that drive the N cycle to tackle these environmental challenges will be increasingly key going forward [11.Stein L.Y. Klotz M.G. The nitrogen cycle.Curr. Biol. 2016; 26: R94-R98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar].
