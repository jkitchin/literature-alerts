The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three‐dimensional (3D) nanoflower‐like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one‐step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O–O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO‐2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm–2, alongside exceptional long‐term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal‐based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO‐2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm–2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First‐principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.

This study explores the effect of Ni-Co-O anode layer microstructure on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Four anodes with similar Ni-Co-O loadings and chemical characteristics but distinct morphologies are fabricated by ultrasonic spraying catalyst inks of varying solvent composition (pure water vs a water-ethanol mixture) and drying temperatures (50 °C and 150 °C) on Ni plates. Upon varying solvent composition, particles in the water-based ink exhibited lower stability than particles in the water-ethanol-based ink, boosting the particle connectivity in the layers. This particle connectivity correlated with the mechanical strength of the layers, resulting in reduced contact resistance and enhanced activity. Our second observation is that at 50 °C, the surface morphology exhibited hill-like islands with higher roughness, while at 150 °C, concave hemispherical shapes with lower roughness were observed. From 2D-distribution data, we found that surface roughness correlated with the wettability with electrolyte. Roughness increased the lyophobicity and enhanced the activity through more accessible active sites and efficient bubble transport. Taken together, this work highlights how microstructure affects macroscopic layer properties, and how these in turn can enhance or diminish the performance of the OER compared to bare nickel, offering insights into the knowledge-based design of anode layers.

Abstract Efforts are underway to develop highly active catalysts to reduce the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Metal–organic frameworks or coordination polymers are promising candidates because of their tunable structures and high surface areas. In this study, Nickel and Cobalt trans ‐ cinnamate ( t‐ca ) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Their structures were analyzed and found to be isostructural. Both complexes exhibited superior electrocatalytic properties in the OER compared to those of IrO 2 , with overpotentials of 373 and 390 mV and Tafel slopes of 58 and 66 mV/dec. These excellent characteristics were attributed to the electron delocalization of the metal centers via interactions with π‐π delocalized organic ligands. Ni t‐ca , with stronger ligand interactions, displayed an enhanced OER catalytic performance, emphasizing the importance of metal–ligand interactions and suggesting that further exploration of diverse π–π delocalized organic ligands and metal centers may lead to further advancements in electrocatalytic activity.

Hydrogen production by water splitting is one of the low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is to develop inexpensive and highly active catalysts. Herein, we present the preparation of electrocatalysts based on cobalt-phosphorus (Co-P) coatings with different P contents for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The Co-P coatings were deposited on the copper (Cu) surface using the inexpensive and simple method of electroless metal deposition. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Co-P coatings deposited on the Cu surface were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), while their activity for HER and OER in 1 M KOH was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSVs) and chrono-techniques. It was found that the catalyst activity for both HER and OER depends on the P content of the catalyst and varies to the highest efficiency for each reaction. The Co-P coating with the 11 wt% of P exhibited the lowest overpotential value of –115.4 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 compared to the Co-P coatings with 8 wt% (–121.5 mV) and 5 wt% (–182.9 mV) of P. In contrast, the lowest OER overpotential (394 mV) was observed for the Co-P coating with the 8 wt% of P to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 as compared to the Co-P coatings with 5 wt% (416 mV) and 11 wt% (432 mV) of P. These results suggest that the obtained catalysts are suitable for HER and OER in alkaline media.

Abstract Zn–air batteries (ZABs) are promising next‐generation energy storage devices due to their low cost, intrinsic safety, and environmental benignity. However, the sluggish kinetics of the cathodic reactions severely limits the ZAB performances in practical use, calling for high‐efficiency bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution electrocatalysts. Herein, an ultrahigh‐active bifunctional electrocatalyst is developed with a record‐low Δ E of 0.56 V, significantly outperforming the noble‐metal‐based benchmark (Pt/C+Ir/C, Δ E = 0.77 V) and many other reported bifunctional electrocatalysts (mostly Δ E ≥ 0.60 V). The nanoscale composite of Fe‐based single‐atom sites and nanosized layered double hydroxides endows the bifunctional electrocatalyst with high conductivity and a large active surface that afford strengthened electron conduction and ion transport pathways. Furthermore, a remarkable improvement in stability is realized following the current division principle. ZABs with the bifunctional electrocatalyst deliver a high peak power density of 198 mW cm −2 and excellent cycling durability for over 6000 cycles. Moreover, ampere‐hour‐scale ZABs are constructed and cycled under 1.0 A and 1.0 Ah conditions. This work breaks the activity record for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and expands the potential of ZABs for sustainable energy storage.

The development and exploration of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting are in high demand and have garnered significant attention in recent years. Herein, by incorporating the advantages of catalytic‐active polyoxometalates (POMs) and structural stable metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), two POM@MOFs composite materials, Ni4Mo12@Fe and Co4Mo12@Fe, have been successfully prepared via the encapsulation of POMs anions [MoV12O30(µ2‐OH)10H2{NiII4(H2O)12}]∙14H2O (noted as Ni4Mo12) and [MoV12O30(μ2‐OH)10 H2{CoII(H2O)3}4]∙12H2O (noted as Co4Mo12) into the cavities of MOFs NH2‐MIL‐101(Fe), respectively. Compared to each individual components, Ni4Mo12@Fe and Co4Mo12@Fe composites, as heterogeneous electrocatalysts, both showed enhanced electrocatalytic capacities for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions with overpotentials of 332.64 mV for Ni4Mo12@Fe and 352.64 mV for Co4Mo12@Fe at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Additionally, the enhanced electrocatalytic capacities of these two composites could also achieve towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Such a POMs‐assisted strategy for the formation of POM@MOFs composites described here paves a new avenue for the development of highly economical, active non‐noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER.

Abstract Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial processes at the cathode of zinc‐air batteries. Developing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts at the air cathode is significant for the practical application of rechargeable zinc‐air batteries. Herein, N‐doped layered MX containing Co 2 P/Ni 2 P nanoparticles is synthesized by growing CoNi‐ZIF on the surface and interlayers of the two‐dimensional material MXene (Ti 2 C 3 ) followed by phosphating calcination. The growth of CoNi‐ZIF on the surface of MXene results in the attenuation of high‐temperature structural damage of MXene, which in turn leads to the formation of Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX with a hierarchical configuration, higher electron conductivity, and abundant active sites. The optimized Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX achieves a half‐wave potential of 0.85 V for the ORR and an overpotential of 345 mV for the OER. In addition, DFT calculations were adopted to investigate the mechanism at the atomic and molecular levels. The liquid zinc‐air battery with Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX as the cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 783.7 mAh g ‐1 and exceeds 280 h (840 cycles) cycle stability, superior to zinc‐air batteries constructed by the cathode of commercial Pt/C+RuO 2 and other previous works. Furthermore, a solid‐state battery synthesized with Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX as the cathode exhibits stable cycle performance (154 h/462 cycles).

Research drives development of sustainable electrocatalytic technologies, but efforts are hindered by inconsistent reporting of advances in catalytic performance. Iridium-based oxide catalysts are widely studied for electrocatalytic technologies, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but insufficient techniques for quantifying electrochemically accessible iridium active sites impede accurate assessment of intrinsic activity improvements. We develop mercury underpotential deposition and stripping as a reversible electrochemical adsorption process to robustly quantify iridium sites and consistently normalize OER performance of benchmark IrO x electrodes to a single intrinsic activity curve, where other commonly used normalization methods cannot. Through rigorous deconvolution of mercury redox and reproportionation reactions, we extract net monolayer deposition and stripping of mercury on iridium sites throughout testing using a rotating ring disk electrode. This technique is a transformative method to standardize OER performance across a wide range of iridium-based materials and quantify electrochemical iridium active sites.

Transition metal‐based electrocatalysts play a crucial role in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their heavy reliance on free electrons at the <i>d</i>‐band significantly limits the screening of potentially efficient, earth‐abundant alternatives. Despite extensive exploration of catalyst engineering through multi‐metal cooperation to modulate electron configuration by introducing additional transition metals, practical success remains elusive. Here, we present a straightforward electrodeposition method for preparing amorphous FeCoAl hydroxide catalysts. The introduction of Al contributes external free electrons, enabling a well‐defined electron configuration for intermediate adsorption. Al doping also adjusts the <i>d</i>‐band position of adjacent Co atoms, bringing them closer to the Fermi level and significantly enhancing intrinsic activity at the active sites. Furthermore, Al dopants facilitate rapid mass and charge transfer near the catalyst layer, promoting faster reaction kinetics. Leveraging these properties, the FeCoAl hydroxide catalyst achieves a large current density of 100 mA cm <sup>‐2</sup> at an overpotential of 340 mV, with a small Tafel slope of 29.1 mV dec <sup>‐1</sup>. Our work provides valuable insights for designing efficient electrocatalysts by leveraging free electron‐rich metal doping and expanding the parameter space for catalyst engineering.

Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting for green hydrogen production necessitates effective electrocatalysts. Currently, commercial catalysts are primarily platinum-based. Therefore, finding catalysts with comparable catalytic activity but lower cost is essential. This paper describes spinel-structured catalysts containing nickel cobaltite NiCo 2 O 4 , graphene, and additionally doped with heteroatoms. The structure and elemental composition of the obtained materials were analyzed by research methods such as TEM, SEM-EDX, XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical measurements showed that hybrid materials containing nickel cobaltite NiCo 2 O 4 doped with graphene are highly active catalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (Tafel slopes = 91 mV dec −1 , overpotential = 468 mV and onset potential = -339 mV), while in the oxygen evolution reaction (Tafel slopes = 51 mV dec −1 , overpotential = 1752 mV and onset potential = 370 mV), bare NiCo 2 O 4 without the addition of carbon has a worse activity (for HER: Tafel slopes = 120 mV dec −1 , overpotential - does not achieve and onset potential = -404 mV, for OER: Tafel slopes = 54 mV dec −1 , overpotential = 1796 mV and onset potential = 410 mV). In terms of stability, comparable results were obtained for each synthesized compound for both the HER and OER reactions.

Covalent organic frameworks with unique π architectures and pores could be developed as photocatalysts for transformations. However, they usually form π‐stacking layers, so that only surface layers function in photocatalysis. Here we report a strategy for developing vertically expanded frameworks to expose originally inaccessible active sites hidden in layers to catalysis. We designed covalently linked two‐dimensional cobalt(II) porphyrin layers and explored coordination bonds to connect the cobalt(II) porphyrin layers with bidentate ligands via a three‐component one‐pot polymerization. The frameworks expand the interlayer space greatly, where both the up and down faces of each cobalt(II) porphyrin layer are exposed to reactants. Unexpectedly, the vertically expanded frameworks increase skeleton oxidation potentials, decrease exciton dissociation energy, improve pore hydrophilicity and affinity to water, and facilitate water delivery. Remarkably, these positive effects work collectively in the photocatalysis of water oxidation into oxygen, with an oxygen production rate of 1155 µmol g−1 h−1, a quantum efficiency of 1.24% at 450 nm, and a turnover frequency of 1.39 h−1, which is even 5.1‐fold as high as that of the π‐stacked frameworks and ranks them the most effective photocatalysts. This strategy offers a new platform for designing layer frameworks to build various catalytic systems for chemical transformations.

Abstract Electrochemical water‐electrolysis for hydrogen generation often requires more energy due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work introduces a double‐layered nanoflower catalyst, NiFe‐LDH@S‐NiFeO x /NF, featuring a crystalline NiFe‐LDH coating on amorphous S‐NiFeO x on nickel foam. Strategically integrating a crystalline‐amorphous (c‐a) heterostructure leverages strain engineering to enhance OER activity with low overpotentials ( η 100 = 220 and η 500 = 245 mV) and stability (135 h at η 100 and 80 h at η 500 ). Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain can optimize the adsorption of oxygen‐containing intermediates to reduce the reaction energy barrier, thus improving the reaction kinetics and performance of OER. Moreover, its phosphated derivative, NiFeP@S‐NiFeO x /NF, exhibits high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance ( η 10 = 64 mV, η 100 = 187 mV). An alkaline water‐electrolysis cell of NiFeP@S‐NiFeO x /NF(−)||NiFe‐LDH@S‐NiFeO x /NF(+) requires only a cell voltage of 1.77 V at 100 mA cm −2 , demonstrating excellent stability over 110 h (at both 10 and 100 mA cm −2 ). This work highlights the benefits of integrating crystal‐amorphous interfaces and strain effects, offering insights into the understanding and optimizing catalytic OER mechanism and advancing water‐electrolysis technology.

Recently, the flexoelectric effect has triggered considerable interest in energy-related applications, such as flexo-actuation, flexo-photovoltaic, and flexo-catalysis, because of its ubiquitous feature allowing the creation of electric polarity, i.e., the flexoelectric polarization (Pflexo), in non-polar materials by strain gradient. Here, we show a flexoelectric strategy in electrocatalytic water splitting. Remarkably enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are achieved in strain-gradient LaFeO3 (LFO) thin-film heterostructures owing to the promotion of kinetic processes by Pflexo. The improved OER is demonstrated by increased current density of ∼300% in linear sweep voltammetry and lowered charge transfer resistance by two orders of magnitude in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These are ascribed to the flexoelectric-induced downward bending of the LFO band, as revealed by density functional theory calculations and band structure measurements. With Pflexo in the thin-film heterostructure catalysts, the adsorption of hydroxyl ions is strengthened on the polar LFO surface, and the transfer of electrons is accelerated from the reactants/key intermediates to the catalyst across the band-tilted LFO layer. These findings indicate the significance of flexoelectric effect in OER kinetics and open a new perspective for exploiting catalytic mechanisms and performances in water splitting.

Utilizing 2‐ethyl imidazole as an etching reagent and the Ostwald ripening process enabled the evolution of nanomesh formation with a precise pore size of inkbottle shape. Material characterization confirmed the evolution of pore structure from layered double hydroxide‐like structure to hierarchical slit‐pores to uniform ink‐bottle pores after 24 h of synthesis with limited pore shrinkage attributable to iron redeposition at the pore entrances. AFM showed a gradual reduction in nanomesh thickness with an increase in synthesis time up to 24 h, indicative of successful exfoliation. The best catalyst (Co0.8Fe0.2(OH)x‐24h) was developed after 24 h of synthesis, having 3.8 nm ink‐bottle‐shaped pores on the basal plane of nanosheets with only 3‐4 layers. Co0.8Fe0.2(OH)x‐24h exhibited the best catalytic performance, characterized by a 330 mV overpotential, a mass activity of 309.1 A/g, and a turnover frequency of 2.28 s‐1. An increased electrochemical surface area (70.74 cm²) and a high roughness factor of approximately 1010 underlined the importance of narrow mesopores in facilitating catalyst‐electrolyte interactions and improving mass transport.

Stable porous manganese oxide-based electrodes are essential for clean energy generation and storage because of their high natural abundance and health safety. This investigation focuses on mesoporous LiMn2–xMxO4 (where M is Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu and x is 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.67) electrodes and thin/thick films. The mesoporous electrodes and films are fabricated by coating clear and homogeneous ethanol solutions of the salts (LiNO3, [Mn(OH2)4](NO3)2, and [M(OH2)x](NO3)2) and surfactants (P123 and CTAB) and calcining at elevated temperature (denoted as F-LiMn2–xMxO4, G-LiMn2–xMxO4, and meso-LiMn2–xMxO4, respectively). The electrochemical properties, stability, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the F/G-LiMn2–xMxO4 electrodes are investigated in alkaline media using a three electrode setup. The F-LiMn1.33M0.67O4 electrodes (where M is Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) exhibit low Tafel slopes of 60, 43, 44, and 32 mV/dec, respectively. While all the Mn-rich and F-LiMn2–xFexO4 electrodes degrade via Mn(VI) disproportionation reaction, the 33% Co electrode shows high stability during the OER. The nickel-based electrodes are stable with as little as 15% Ni and display excellent OER performance over 25% Ni, albeit undergoing a transformation that accumulates Ni(OH)2 species on the electrode surface. Copper in the F-LiMn2–xCuxO4 electrodes is homogeneous at low Cu percentages but forms a CuO phase above 15% Cu, undergoes degradation, and displays a weak OER performance. In short, Co and Ni stabilize the F-LiMn1.33Co0.67O4 and F-LiMn1.7Ni0.3O4 electrodes, which display excellent OER performance.

Ruthenium (Ru)‐ and iridium (Ir)‐based nanomaterials have always been regarded as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes. Herein, we develop a facile dodecylamine‐assisted hydrothermal synthesis for producing carbon‐supported IrRu alloy nanoparticles with controllable Ir/Ru ratios and ultrafine sizes towards high‐efficiency OER and overall water electrolysis. In this strategy, the dodecylamine that serves as a capping and reducing agent enables the final IrRu alloy nanoparticles to possess average sizes < 3 nm and high degree of dispersion on carbon substrate. By combining high OER activity of Ru with high acidic robustness of Ir, the as‐prepared IrRu/C nanoparticles at a suitable Ir/Ru ratio of 1/3 show good activity and durability for the OER electrocatalysis and overall water splitting. In specific, the Ir1Ru3/C catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential of 302 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm‐2 and the highest mass activity of 120.5 mA mg‐1 at 1.532 V for OER in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, a two‐electrode acidic electrolyzer assembled with Ir1Ru3/C at anode and commercial Pt/C at cathode (Pt/C|| Ir1Ru3/C) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.44 V for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm‐2, along with a satisfied 20‐h durability.

Development of highly active and stable acidic oxygen evolution reaction catalyst is very important for efficient water splitting while remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly ordered RuO2/WO3 inverse opals (IOs) catalyst to address the bottleneck problem of see-saw relationship between activity and stability, in which the crystalline and corrosionresistant WO3 facilitates electron transport and stabilizes RuO2, whereas the lattice mismatch-induced amorphousdominated RuO2 provides abundant unsaturated coordination sites to enhance the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Consequently, the RuO2/WO3 IOs demonstrates outstanding acidic OER performance in terms of a low overpotential of 180 mV to reach 10 mA·cm–2, and excellent stability for maintaining 100 hours continuous test. Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that interface coupling between WO3 and RuO2 can enhance the spin polarization of electrons and increase the overlaps of the electronic projected density of states between the Ru d orbitals of active metal and the O p orbitals of oxygen intermediates, facilitating OER pathway to switch from lattice oxygen mechanism to adsorbate evolution mechanism, which significantly decreases the reaction energy barrier of OER process. Meanwhile, the rich oxygen vacancies and WO3 supports in the heterostructures could inhibit the over-oxidation of Ru species, so as to enhance the activity and stability simultaneously.

Abstract The interfacial electric field ( IEF ) between heterogeneous units plays an important role in the electronic modulation of active centers during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the weak electronic coupling between spatially separated IEF s limits the deep activation of metal sites on the surface of the catalyst. Herein, a proof‐of‐concept strategy is provided that imbed MS 2 (M = Ni 3 Fe) species with high spin Fe orbits into heterogeneous units to promote the electron penetrating between IEF s. By designing a Fe 2 O 3 @MS/MS 2 @MO y model catalyst, the electronic interaction between adjacent IEF s is effectively enhanced for the deep oxidation of bimetals on the surface, breaking the competing relationship between adsorbed evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) of catalysts during OER. As a result, the onset overpotential of the synthesized electrode is only 171 mV, and it maintains excellent stability for more than 2300 h at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte.

Electrolysis of water is one of low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is designing and developing low-cost and high-activity catalysts. Herein, we present a strategy to fabricate flexible electrocatalysts based on nickel-iron (NiFe) alloy coatings. NiFe coatings were plated on the flexible copper-coated polyimide surface (Cu/PI) using the low-cost and straightforward electroless metal plating method and morpholine borane as a reducing agent. It was found that Ni90Fe10, Ni80Fe20, Ni60Fe40, and Ni30Fe70 coatings were deposited on the Cu/PI surface, then the concentration of Fe2+ in the plating solution was 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM, respectively. Morphology, structure, and composition of NixFey/Cu/PI catalysts have been examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), whereas their activity has been investigated for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in 1 M KOH using linear sweep voltammetry (LSVs). It was found that the Ni80Fe20/Cu/PI catalyst exhibited the lowest overpotential value of –202.7 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm–2 compared to Ni90Fe10/Cu/PI (–211.9 mV), Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI (–276.3 mV), Ni30Fe70/Cu/PI (–278.4 mV), and Ni (−303.4 mV). On the other hand, the lowest OER overpotential (344.7 mV) was observed for the Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI catalyst to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm–2 as compared with the Ni30Fe70 (369.9 mV), Ni80Fe20 (450.2 mV), Ni90Fe10 (454.2 mV) coatings, and Ni (532.1 mV). The developed Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI catalyst exhibit a cell potential of 1.85 V at 10 mA cm−2. The obtained catalysts seem to be suitable flexible catalysts for HER and OER in alkaline media.

In the pursuit of utilizing renewable energy sources for green hydrogen (H 2 ) production, alkaline water electrolysis has emerged as a key technology. To improve the reaction rates of overall water electrolysis and simplify electrode manufacturing, development of bifunctional electrocatalysts is of great relevance. Herein, CoPBO/Co 3 O 4 is reported as a binary composite catalyst comprising amorphous (CoPBO) and crystalline (Co 3 O 4 ) phases as a high‐performing bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water electrolysis. Owing to the peculiar properties of CoPBO and Co 3 O 4 , such as complementing Gibbs free energy values for H‐adsorption (Δ G H ) and relatively smaller difference in their work functions (ΔΦ), the composite exhibits H 2 spillover (HS) mechanism to facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The outcome is manifested in the form of a low HER overpotential of 65 mV (at 10 mA cm −2 ). Moreover, an abundant amount of surface oxygen vacancies (O v ) are observed in the same CoPBO/Co 3 O 4 composite that facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well, leading to a mere 270 mV OER overpotential (at 10 mA cm −2 ). The present work showcases the possibilities to strategically design non‐noble composite catalysts that combine the advantages of HS phenomenon as well as O v to achieve new record performances in alkaline water electrolysis.

Abstract Interface engineering is an efficient strategy to create high‐performance electrocatalysts for water splitting. In the present work, CeO 2 @CoSe 2 nanoneedle on carbon cloth (CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC) demonstrates high efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water splitting. CeO 2 with abundant O vacancies facilitates the adsorption of OH − and boosts the reconstruction of CoSe 2 into CoOOH at lower potentials. The in situ generated active CeO 2 @CoOOH heterointerface upshifts the d‐band center of Co site, thereby decreasing the free energy of rate‐determining step (RDS) ( * O to * OOH) during the OER process. It delivers a low OER overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm −2 . CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC is also found to be active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 138 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 ), profiting from CeO 2 ‐facilitated * H 2 O dissociation and * H adsorption on CoSe 2 . The overall water splitting is achieved over the CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC bifunctional electrode with a low electrolysis voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm −2 . This work offers valuable insights into CeO 2 ‐assisted surface reconstruction as well as provides water electrolysis catalysts through interface engineering.

Perovskite oxides have been extensively investigated as active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. While the OER activity of some perovskite oxides is positively influenced by Fe ions in the electrolyte, the impact of other transition metal ions in the electrolyte remains unclear. In this study, we compared the influence of Co ions intentionally added to the electrolyte on the OER activities of two Fe‐based perovskite oxides (Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3−δ and LaFeO3). While the OER activity of Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3−δ is significantly enhanced by adding Co ions to the electrolyte, LaFeO3 showed little difference in the OER behavior between the Co‐free and Co‐containing electrolytes. In the case of Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3−δ, an amorphous layer was formed, and the Co ions from the electrolyte were incorporated on the surface as a result of OER cycling. On the other hand, Co ions were also detected on the surface of LaFeO3, but its crystalline structure remains unchanged during the OER. Our study suggests that synergistic interplay between the perovskite oxides undergoing a structural transformation at the surface and transition metal ions in the electrolyte can improve the OER activity.

The development of high-entropy materials as active and durable catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is important but challenging for hydrogen production from water electrolysis. In contrast to conventional synthesis strategies that usually involve high-temperature annealing, a novel poly(ethylene glycol)-barbituric acid deep eutectic solvent-assisted strategy was developed in this work to successfully synthesize high-entropy nitrides (HENs) (FeCoNiCuZn)N at a record low temperature of 473 K. Multiple analytical characterizations illustrate that dual entropic and enthalpic forces provided by the poly(ethylene glycol)-barbituric acid deep eutectic solvent play a critical role in the low-temperature synthesis of HENs. The prepared HENs have a microsphere structure consisting of five highly dispersed active metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) species, which are conducive to boosting oxygen evolution reaction performance in alkaline media, in terms of a low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm⁻² and sustained durability over 30 hours at 400 mA cm⁻². This work paves the way for the fabrication of high-entropy materials with excellent electrocatalytic properties for future energy conversion and storage applications.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a multistep proton-coupled four-electron process with sluggish kinetics, which seriously limits the hydrogen production efficiency, thus it is of great importance to develop an efficient and stable OER catalyst. In this study, a two-step differential pyrolysis strategy is employed to design a three-dimensional porous microstructured material consisting of RuOx nanoparticles coated by a thin-layer carbon, where the active particles were isolated in separate chambers and the RuOx nanoparticles mainly existed in the form of a heterogeneous interface between RuO2 and partial metallic Ru. The preparation parameters of the catalysts are optimized via combining transient and steady-state polarization properties, and the target catalyst Cat-500–1.5t shows the best OER catalytic performance after ca. 60 h of a chronopotentiometry test in an acidic medium with a much smaller performance change than other samples. The unique design of adopting a carbon layer to form separate reaction chambers largely mitigates the excessive oxidation loss of the active components under strong oxidation potential. The suitability of the catalyst with the loaded substrate and test media is explored, and in an acidic medium, the carbon paper is much better than the titanium fiber, while in an alkaline medium, the titanium fiber is obviously superior to the carbon paper. On both carbon paper and titanium fiber, the performance in an alkaline medium outperforms that in an acidic medium, and the possible reasons for the performance difference are analyzed. Herein, to obtain the actual electrocatalytic performance, the optimal design of the catalyst structure and matching suitable conductive substrate in a specific medium are quite necessary, which provides a feasible strategy for the acquisition of efficient and stable electrocatalysts and the desirable presentation of performance.

Abstract The efficient anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is challenging with low cell voltage and long‐term stability at large current density, due to the unstable anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fe‐based electrocatalysts are potential candidates for the anodic OER. In Fe‐based materials, iron oxides always show better stability in alkaline solution but lower OER activity. However, the catalysts in previous study are difficult to continuously and effectively activate iron oxides supported on carbon during electrocatalysis. Herein, a new class of electrocatalyst: bamboo‐like carbon nanotubes (B‐CNT)‐encapsulated Fe 2 C nanoparticles (NPs) supported Fe 2 O 3 nanoclusters (NCs), named Fe 2 O 3 /B‐CNT@Fe 2 C is reported. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that B‐CNT‐encapsulate Fe 2 C NPs activate Fe 2 O 3 NCs by the d‐p‐d orbital coupling, thereby weakening the adsorption of OOH* intermediate during OER process. The electrolyzer based on the electrocatalyst requires only 1.48 V to reach 1.0 A cm −2 and shows a long‐term stability at 1.0 A cm −2 for 1600 h, comparable to the best‐reported values for the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE).

Abstract We efficiently synthesize magnesium copper phosphate nanoparticles (MgCuPO4) doped with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) using a hydrothermal method for supercapattery and oxygen evolution reactions in KOH electrolyte. The GQDs-MgCuPO4 electrode has a high specific capacity (1188 Cg-1 at 1.0 Ag-1) and a high-rate capability (67%). The symmetric supercapattery (GQDs-MgCuPO4/GQDs-MgCuPO4) provides a staggering energy density of 46 Wh-kg-1, as well as a high-power density of 1300 W-kg-1 and a high cyclic stability of 93% after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, it demonstrates high efficiency in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with corresponding low overpotentials of 181 mV and 119 mV. The GQDs-MgCuPO4 stands out as a capable solution for various energy storage and conversion difficulties.

NiFe (oxy)hydroxide has been widely used as a benchmark anodic catalyst for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in alkaline water electrolysis devices; however, the energy saving actually takes contributions from both the anodic OER and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, we observe the catalytic promotion upon the in situ-derived NiFe (oxy)hydroxide from the NiFe alloy monolithic electrode and also point out that the coupled nickel cathode is contaminated, leading to the loss of HER activity and a reduction in overall efficiency. It is found that Ni2+ and Fe3+ cations are inevitably detached from the anode into the electrolyte and electrodeposited on the nickel cathode after the three-month industrial simulation. This research presents the significant enhancement of the oxygen evolution catalysis using an in situ aging process and emphasizes that the catalytic application should not only be isolated on the half reaction, but a reasonable coupled electrode match to get rid of the contamination from the electrolyte is also of great significance to sufficiently present the intrinsic catalytic yielding for the real application.

During the high-temperature oxygen evolution reaction for CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), the key elementary process of O2– transfer is restricted by the high anodic oxygen pressure thermodynamically, thus requiring a high external voltage [open-circuit voltage (OCV)] to drive the electrolysis reaction. Herein, electrochemical CH4 reforming is introduced to the SOEC anode, which remarkably lowers the anodic oxygen pressure and OCV, finally reducing the energy demand from 3.12 to 0.11 kW h per cubic meter of CO. Meanwhile, atomically dispersed Ru species is anchored on the anode surface due to the strong metal–support interaction, which exhibits superior CH4 reforming activity (90% of CO selectivity) and stability (300 h) to the infiltrated Ru nanoparticles and doped Ru species in the bulk lattice at 600 °C. This work proposes an efficient strategy to boost the SOEC performance thermodynamically and produce value-added chemicals at both the cathode and anode of SOEC simultaneously.

Rechargeable Zn-air batteries are considered to be an effective energy storage device due to their high energy density, environmental friendliness, and long operating life. Further progress on rechargeable Zn-air batteries with high energy density/power density is greatly needed to satisfy the increasing energy conversion and storage demands. This review summarizes the strategies proposed so far to pursue high-efficiency Zn-air batteries, including the aspects of the electrocatalysts (from noble metals to non-noble metals), the electrode chemistry (from the oxygen evolution reaction to the organic oxidation reaction), electrode engineering (from powdery to free-standing), aqueous electrolytes (from alkaline to non-alkaline) and the battery configuration (from liquid to flexible). An essential evaluation of electrochemistry is highlighted to solve the challenges in boosting the efficiency of rechargeable metal-air batteries. In the end, the perspective on current challenges and future research directions to promote the industrial application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries is provided.

The acid-base microenvironment of the metal center is crucial for constructing advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, the correlation between acidic site and OER performance remains unclear for cobalt-based catalysts. Herein, Lewis acid sites in hollow cobalt phytate micropolyhedra (M-CoPA, M = Cu, Sr) were synthesized by a cation-exchange strategy, and their OER performances were studied systematically. Experimentally, Lewis acid Cu2+ sites with stronger Lewis acidity exhibited superior intrinsic activity and long-term stability in alkaline electrolytes. The spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show Lewis acid sites in hollow cobalt phytate micropolyhedra can modulate the electronic distribution of the adjacent cobalt center and further optimize the adsorption strength of oxygenated species. This study figures out the effect of Lewis acid sites on the OER kinetics and provides an effective way to develop high-efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion systems.

The design and development of highly active non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for metal-air batteries. In this work, the electrocatalytic performance of different p-block metal (PM = Sn, Sb, Pb and Bi) atoms embedded in the g-CN monolayer (PMx@g-CN, x = 1–3) for the OER and ORR was systematically investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The strong interaction between PMx atoms and g-CN substrates indicates the good stability of PMx@g-CN catalysts. Among all the designed catalysts, Bi3@g-CN is found to be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the OER and ORR with the calculated overpotential ηOER and ηORR of 0.23 and 0.25 V, respectively. With the atomic active sites of PMx increasing from x = 1 to 3, the OER and ORR catalytic activity is enhanced. The correlations between the overpotentials of the OER/ORR and Bader charge values of the anchored PMx atoms of the catalysts were established. Our findings contribute to searching for noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts and shed light on the rational design of atomic active sites on electrocatalysts.

The interaction between interfacial water and transition metal oxides is a primary enabling step for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). RuO2 is a prototypical OER electrocatalyst whose ability to activate interfacial water molecules is essential to its OER activity. We image the dissociation of surface water into OH* and O* on RuO2(110), where * denotes adsorbed species, using atomic force microscopy. Starting from the surface-bound water molecules, which form a one-dimensional network along the rows of Ru surface sites, increasing the oxidative potential strips hydrogen away and transforms the water molecules into OH* and O*. This oxidative step changes the pattern of the adsorbates from one- to two-dimensional. First-principles calculations with interfacial polarization, capacitive charging, and adsorbate interactions attribute this evolution to the cooperative dehydrogenation of adsorbed water and OH* on RuO2. We use these results to map the surface phase diagram of RuO2(110) and provide a quantitative interpretation of its cyclic voltammetry. Our result provides the visualization of the water dissociation on a conductive oxide surface, a critical step in the OER, and demonstrates that the water activation is a collective phenomenon at RuO2(110) electrodes.

The practical application of rechargeable zinc-air batteries faces challenges stemming from inadequate bifunctional catalysts, contradictory gas-liquid-solid three-phase interfaces, and an ambiguous fundamental understanding. Herein, we propose a chameleon-like bifunctional catalyst comprising ruthenium single-atoms grafted onto nickel-iron layer double hydroxide (RuSA-NiFe LDH). The adaptive oxidation of RuSA-NiFe LDH to oxyhydroxide species (RuSA-NiFeOOH) during charging exposes active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction, while reversible reduction to NiFe LDH during discharge exposes active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction. Additionally, a hierarchical air cathode featuring hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers facilitates the reversible conversion between RuSA-NiFe LDH and RuSA-NiFeOOH, expedites oxygen bubble desorption, and suppresses carbon corrosion. Consequently, our zinc-air batteries demonstrate a high charge/discharge capacity of 100 mAh cm−2 per cycle, a voltage gap of 0.67 V, and an extended cycle life of 2400 h at 10 mA cm−2. We comprehensively elucidate the catalytic reaction thermodynamics and kinetics for the air cathode through electrode potential decoupling monitoring, oxygen bubble desorption tracking, and carbon content quantification. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries hold great promise for energy storage but face several challenges. In this study, the authors introduce a chameleon-like catalyst and a hierarchical air cathode, achieving a 2400-hour cycle life for these batteries.

The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three‐dimensional (3D) nanoflower‐like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one‐step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O–O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO‐2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm–2, alongside exceptional long‐term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal‐based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO‐2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm–2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First‐principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.

Designing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is crucial for green hydrogen production via the water‐splitting system. The bifunctional electrocatalyst offers a promising strategy due to the simplified preparation process and reduced expenses. However, the single‐component bifunctional catalysts often struggle to match the redox potential of water and to achieve proper adsorption/desorption of Gibbs free energy for both H and O intermediates simultaneously. Herein, through precisely controlling the topological transformation path of the RuNiOx precursor, we successfully prepared high‐performance RuNi/Ni and Ru/NiO heterostructure electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, respectively. The energy level matching between the fabricated electrocatalyst and water oxidation/reduction potential confirms the feasibility of HER and OER. The synergistic effect between the active sites ensures rapid, intermediate adsorption/desorption kinetics. As a result, the assembled alkaline overall water splitting setup achieves a current density of 1 A cm‐2 at 2 V and maintains stable operation at 100 mA cm‐2 for 100 hours.

Comprehensive Summary Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted significant attention due to their high atomic utilization and tunable coordination environment. However, the catalytic mechanisms related to the active center and coordination environment remain unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities of NiN 4 , NiN 3 , NiN 3 H 2 , NiN 4 X, NiN 3 X, and NiN 3 H 2 X (X denotes axial ligand) through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study unveils two distinct reaction pathways for ORR and OER, involving proton‐electron pairs adsorbed from both the solution and the catalyst surface. The overpotential is the key parameter to evaluate the catalytic performance when proton‐electron pairs are adsorbed from the solution. NiN 3 and NiN 3 H 2 show promise as pH‐universal bifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER. On the other hand, when proton‐electron pairs are adsorbed from the catalyst surface, the reaction energy barrier becomes the crucial metric for assessing catalytic activity. Our investigation reveals that NiN 3 H 2 consistently exhibits optimal ORR activity across a wide pH range, regardless of the source of proton‐electron pair (solvent or catalyst surface).

ABSTRACT It has been a long‐standing challenge to cultivate capable and resilient oxygen electrocatalysts with higher activity, low price, and long lifetime to replace the commonly used platinum group metals, i.e., Pt for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and RuO 2 /IrO 2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work presents a promising approach to address the challenges associated with oxygen electrocatalysis by introducing a cobalt phosphide/metallic cobalt (Co 2 P/Co) core wrapped in a nitrogen‐doped conductive carbon (CN) nano‐shell, demonstrated as Co 2 P/Co@NC. The strong chemical bonding between metallic cobalt and phosphorus, nitrogen and conductive carbon contributes to the enhanced conductivity and stability of the electrocatalyst. The nitrogen doping in the carbon shell provides additional Co–N active sites, which are crucial for ORR activity. Co 2 P/Co@NC demonstrates promising activity and stability compared to noble metals such as Pt for ORR in an alkaline medium. This suggests its potential as a cost‐effective alternative to Pt‐based catalysts. Further, due to factors such as strong cobalt‐phosphide bonding, high cobalt oxidation states and excellent conductivity of the nitrogen‐doped carbon shell, the Co 2 P/Co@NC outperforms noble metal oxides like iridium dioxide (IrO 2 ) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) for OER. Co 2 P/Co@NC exhibits a low potential difference of 0.63 V, which is among the lowest reported for bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of both ORR and OER. Overall, the described strategy offers a promising avenue for developing efficient, low‐cost and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reactions, which are crucial for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries.

Ti 3 C 2 , one typical MXene, has great potential to be coupled with various transition metals. Herein, a novel and effective catalyst is developed by synergistically loading VCoCO x onto Ti 3 C 2 ‐modified nickel foam (VCoCO x –Ti 3 C 2 @NF). Field emission scanning electron microscope and high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy are employed to characterize the morphology and structure. As expected, the catalyst optimized by response surface methodology attains overpotentials of 290 and 64 mV and Tafel slopes of 82 and 79 mV dec −1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. By using the bifunctional VCoCO x –Ti 3 C 2 @NF catalyst, the water splitting current density achieves 10 mA cm −2 in 1.0 mol L −1 KOH electrolyte at cell voltage of 1.52 V, comparable with the noble metal electrolyzer Pt@C@NF||RuO 2 @NF (1.57 V). Furthermore, the resulting catalyst exhibits excellent cycling durability after 120 h of continuous catalysis, which retains 103.8% and 105.4% of potential (V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for OER and HER, respectively. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the Gibbs free energy barriers for the OER and HER intermediates are reduced due to the integration of VCoCO x with Ti 3 C 2 @NF. The fabricated VCoCO x –Ti 3 C 2 @NF catalyst is a promising electrochemical material for clean energy production.

A promising potential new electrocatalyst for water splitting could be developed through the meticulous design and synthesis of diverse bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). These MOFs would use different or the same metals from the d and f blocks and could have different oxidation states. This study focuses on developing an efficient bimetallic electrocatalyst, based on the rare-earth lanthanide series element europium (Eu) and transition-metal copper (Cu) as the MOF using a one-pot hydrothermal method. As a result, a significant 4f–3d heterovalent heterobimetallic MOF was obtained, and its electrocatalytic activity toward water splitting was evaluated. Further, heterobimetallic MOFs with their mixed valence display an improved water-splitting performance through synergistic effects. Linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) studies reveal that the bimetallic Eu–Cu-MOF required an overpotential of 133 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 240 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 20 mA cm–2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, the long-term stability study exhibits a stable nature up to 20 and 16 h in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions, respectively. The incorporation of Eu synergistically increases the adsorption and desorption ability of OH– and O2 molecules toward OER, respectively. The bimetallic MOF displayed excellent stability under acidic as well as alkaline conditions, indicating an exciting future for Eu–Cu-MOF in the field of electrochemical water splitting.

Abstract Clean energy and environmental pollution are two key concerns of modern society and are pivotal necessities for the economic, social, and sustainable development of the world. Today around 80% of energy is generated using nonrenewable resources and fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal) which ultimately results in hazardous global emissions. As a clean substitute for fossil fuels, hydrogen has emerged as a promising and renewable energy resource. Utilization of this energy resource requires the development of active, stable, low‐cost environmentally friendly techniques. Water splitting electrolysis is a method for producing clean and efficient hydrogen using an environmentally benign technique that is currently at its most mature stage. Electrolysis is attracting ever‐increasing attention, as it is a promising electrochemical device for hydrogen production from water due to the high conversion efficiency and relatively low energy input required when compared to thermochemical and photocatalytic methods. This paper will outline the need, performance, and insight of anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer. Recent developments in the design and preparation of AEM. New strategies for activity, stability, and efficiency improvement of AEM. Membrane types, and factors affecting AEM performance in an electrolyzer. This review also discusses the effects, operating characteristics, and energy consumption of electrocatalysts in the AEM electrolyzer. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pathways and mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This study seeks to provide a detailed overview of recent accomplishments in the field of the hydrogen economy, particularly electrolysis, to inspire further research and development to address the technology's obstacles.

Abstract The development of a nonnoble metal‐based cost‐effective, efficient, and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst is crucial to achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. In this study, a structural and interfacial engineering approach is employed to design a 2D–2D hierarchical nickel MOF/nickel hydroxide‐derived nickel selenide/nickel telluride dual‐phase material through a single‐step selenotellurization process. The rational design of highly ordered nanoarchitectures provides well‐defined voids and ample pathways for ion diffusion. Furthermore, hierarchical nickel selenide/nickel telluride works synergistically at heterojunctions, providing a local ion enrichment mechanism for the catalytic process. As a result, Ni 0.85 Se/NiTe 2 @Ni‐NH@CC needs an overpotential of 69 and 240 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm −2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, with an outstanding stability observed for over 100 h. Moreover, the Ni 0.85 Se/NiTe 2 @Ni‐NH@CC (+, −) device exhibits excellent overall water‐splitting performance with a cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm −2 and can be operated steadily for >100 h at 100 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate favorable kinetics for H‐adsorption at the selenotelluride heterojunction, thereby promoting the HER. This work highlights a new approach for designing a unique nanoarchitecture of MOF/hydroxide‐derived selenotelluride heterojunctions for high‐efficiency energy conversion applications.

The primary obstacle in electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen (H2) production is the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, a promising approach to overcome this barrier involves replacing the OER with the more energetically favorable methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), providing a practical avenue for efficient and energy-saving H2 generation. This paper proposes a bifunctional electrocatalyst, successfully synthesizing a trimetallic hybrid NiCoMg-LDH composite via a one-step hydrothermal method supported on 3-DCF (carbon felt). Additionally, the stability of the electrolyzer was assessed by the statistical modeling and predictive time series analysis (LSTM) technique. The synthesized multimetallic self-supported NiCoMg-LDH composition formed porous hexagonal sheet-like structures, demonstrating outstanding bifunctional activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER, achieving low overpotentials of 0.185 and 0.161 V for HER and OER at an applied current density of 100 mA/cm2, respectively. Additionally, when employed parallel as the anode and cathode for total water splitting, it necessitated only 1.56 V to achieve 100 mA/cm2, surpassing the compared benchmark Pt/C∥RuO2 electrodes. Furthermore, the cell voltage of the NiCoMg-LDH∥NiCoMg-LDH-based methanol–water electrolyzer at 100 mA/cm2 was notably reduced by 250 mV compared to that of the OER alone at the anode. Therefore, from these results, the superior electroactivity of the trimetallic NiCoMg-LDH catalyst is primarily attributed to its high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), abundant active sites, and rapid electron transfer from the catalyst surface to the electrolyte. Therefore, this study represents a significant advancement in the design and development of stable, highly active, and economical hybrid catalysts for green energy harvesting applications.

Electrochemical water splitting required efficient electrocatalysts to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Here, we adopted greenway coprecipitation (GC) method to synthesize conducting polymer (CP) nanotunnel network affixed with luminal–abluminal CoNi hydroxides (GC-CoNiCP), namely, GC-Co1Ni2CP, GC-Co1.5Ni1.5CP, and GC-Co2Ni1CP. The active catalyst, GC-Co2Ni1CP/GC, has low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (307 mV) and a smaller Tafel slope (47 mV dec–1) than IrO2 (125 mV dec–1). The electrochemical active surface area (EASA) normalized linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve exhibited outstanding intrinsic activity of GC-Co2Ni1CP, which required 285 mV to attain 10 mA cm–2. At 1.54 V, the estimated turnover frequency (TOF) of GC-Co2Ni1CP/GC (0.017337 s–1) was found to be 3-fold higher than that of IrO2 (0.0014 s–1). Furthermore, the GC-Co2Ni1CP/NF consumed a very low overpotential (281 mV) with a small Tafel slope of 121 mV dec–1. The ultrastability of GC-Co2Ni1CP for industrial application was confirmed by durability at 10 and 100 mA cm–2 for the OER (GC/NF-8 h, 2.0%/100 h, 2.2%) and overall water splitting (100 h, 3.8%), which implies that GC-Co2Ni1CP had adequate kinetics to address the elevated rates of water oxidation. The effect of pH and addition of tetramethylammonium cation (TMA+) reveal that GC-Co2Ni1CP follows the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). The solar-powered water electrolysis at 1.55 V supports the efficacy of GC-Co2Ni1CP in the solar-to-hydrogen conversion. The environmental impact studies and solar-driven water electrolysis proved that GC-CoNiCP has excellent greenness and efficiency, respectively.

Abstract The rapid capacity loss attributed to irreversible phase reactions and structural instability has consistently affected the development of P2‐layered cathode materials. Moreover, the introduction of costly elements such as single or multiple dopants has failed to resolve the sustainability challenges in designing an optimal Mn‐based layered oxide cathode. This study proposes a Co‐Ni‐free, poly‐elemental doping strategy (Li, Mg, and Cu) combined with high sodium content for an Mn‐based P2‐layered cathode designed for Na + ion storage. In situ X‐ray diffraction analysis confirms the absence of P2 – O2 phase transitions during cycling for both NLMMC87 (Na 0.87 Li 0.1 Mg 0.1 Mn 0.7 Cu 0.1 O 2 ) and NLMMC77 (Na 0.77 Li 0.1 Mg 0.1 Mn 0.7 Cu 0.1 O 2 ). This can be attributed to the co‐substitution of the electronegative Cu element and the stabilizing dopants Li and Mg, which suppress oxygen evolution. Simultaneously, the high sodium content within the host structure promotes high reversible capacity, enhances structural stability, and minimizes internal stress due to volume changes. Moreover, NLMMC87 demonstrates a reversible capacity of 167.9 mA h g −1 at 0.1 C (97% Coulombic efficiency) and maintains excellent stability across various current rates. Further investigations into the practical application of NLMMC87 in a sodium full cell will be a critical step toward realizing an ideal cathode for sodium‐ion batteries.

Abstract Zn‐CO 2 batteries (ZCBs) are promising for CO 2 conversion and electric energy release. However, the ZCBs couple the electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECO 2 R) with the oxygen evolution reaction and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, which normally causes ultrahigh charge voltage and CO 2 conversion efficiency attenuation, thereby resulting in ~90% total power consumption. Herein, isolated FeN 3 sites encapsulated in hierarchical porous carbon nanoboxes (Fe‐HPCN, derived from the thermal activation process of ferrocene and polydopamine‐coated cubic ZIF‐8) were proposed for hydrazine‐assisted rechargeable ZCBs based on ECO 2 R (discharging process: CO 2 + 2H + → CO + H 2 O) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, charging process: N 2 H 4 + 4OH − → N 2 + 4H 2 O + 4e − ). The isolated FeN 3 endows the HzOR with a lower overpotential and boosts the ECO 2 R with a 96% CO Faraday efficiency (FE CO ). Benefitting from the bifunctional ECO 2 R and HzOR catalytic activities, the homemade hydrazine‐assisted rechargeable ZCBs assembled with the Fe‐HPCN air cathode exhibited an ultralow charge voltage (decreasing by ~1.84 V), excellent CO selectivity (FE CO close to 100%), and high 89% energy efficiency. In situ infrared spectroscopy confirmed that Fe‐HPCN can generate rate‐determining *N 2 and *CO intermediates during HzOR and ECO 2 R. This paper proposes FeN 3 centers for bifunctional ECO 2 R/HzOR performance and further presents the pioneering achievements of ECO 2 R and HzOR for hydrazine‐assisted rechargeable ZCBs.

LOCALIZED CORROSION OF ALUMINUM IN AERATED ENVIRONMENTS AND IN ENVIRONMENTS WITH LOW OXYGEN CONTENT: STUDY AND COMPARISON THROUGH POLARIZATION CURVES. In this study, the influence of deaeration on the electrochemical behavior of aluminum was studied by polarization techniques. The advantages of deaeration for the evaluation of localized corrosion on aluminum are discussed. The influence of the corrosive environment with low oxygen contents on the electrochemical response of aluminum was evaluated by anodic and cathodic potentiodynamic polarization curves. The polarization tests were carried out in chloride solutions followed by optical and scanning electron microscopy characterization. It was observed that deaeration of the solution significantly influences the electrochemical behavior of aluminum, as predicted by corrosion kinetics theories. For the cathodic curves, a decrease in the limiting current density for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was observed for low oxygen solutions, while the “apparent” initiation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was shifted to higher potentials. In the anodic curves, a common passive behavior was not observed in aerated conditions, however, at the corrosion potential, localized pitting was observed indicating that the material was already above the breakdown potential (Ebr). In the low oxygen content solution, however, a passive region with a breakdown potential, was observed on the anodic curves.

Abstract Lutao is an islet off the eastern coast of the main island of Taiwan and is composed of pyroclastic agglomerates, volcanic breccias, lava flows, and dykes. There have been no reports of SIMS zircon oxygen isotopic data from Lutao Island so far, which has significantly hampered further understanding of its magmatic processes, such as crystallization, evolution, and generation of magma. In this study, we use zircon U–Pb dating, Lu–Hf and O isotopic analysis to constrain the age, origin, and magmatic processes of the volcanic rocks from Lutao Island. Integration of our new U–Pb and Hf–O isotope data with available published data allows us to better assess the timing and magmatic processes of Lutao Island in the context of the northern Luzon arc system. This work is the first report of SIMS zircon oxygen isotopic data of volcanic rocks from Lutao island. This study shows that the volcanic rocks from Lutao Island were generated by mantle-derived magma associated with high-T° hydrothermal alteration by seawater-derived fluids.

This article presents a comprehensive study on the streamer propagation and electric field distribution within a two-dimensional fluid model of a packed bed reactor (PBR) filled with carbon dioxide, utilizing the PASSKEy simulation platform. The research delves into the spatiotemporal evolution of electron density, electric fields and key plasma species in the discharge process. The model simulates a PBR with layered dielectric spheres, indicates that the inner sides of the first and second layers of dielectric spheres are not the primary regions for reactions such as CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation; instead, the main regions are along the streamer propagation path and the outer side of the first layer of dielectric spheres. The study by examining the propagation of streamers in the presence of an electric field, highlighting the influence of anode voltage rise and dielectric polarization on local electric field enhancement. This enhancement leads to increased electron density and temperature, facilitating streamer propagation and the formation of filamentary microdischarges and surface ionization waves. The article provides a detailed analysis of the local electric field evolution at specific points within the PBR. The research further investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of spatial and surface charges, revealing that negative charges concentrate within the streamer and on the dielectric surface, with densities significantly higher than positive charges. The positive charges' distribution is closely related to the streamer's path, and over time, they come to dominate the charge distribution in the discharge space. The study also explores the surface charge deposition on the dielectric spheres, discusses the evolution trends of the distribution. Additionally, the article discusses the temporal and spatial evolution of key plasma species, including ions and radicals, and their contribution to the overall discharge characteristics. The production mechanisms of carbon monoxide particles, carbon dioxide ions, and oxygen ions are analyzed, with a focus on their spatial distribution and correlation with electron density. The study concludes with an examination of the energy deposition within the PBR, integrating the spatial energy deposition of electrons and major positive ions. The results indicate a total energy deposition value of approximately 1.428 mJ/m, with carbon dioxide ions accounting for 8.8% of this value.

Research leading to murburn (‘mured burning’) concept disclosed the previously ignored, yet unavoidable central physiological function of diffusible reactive (oxygen/sulfur/nitrogen) species (abbreviated as DRS or DROS/DRSS/DRNS) at low concentrations, namely that of coupling factors in numerous redox-processes, like oxidative-/photo-phosphorylation, leading to direct in fluid ATP synthesis by exergonic radical reactions. The formation of oxygen-centric anions/radicals near proteins/membrane surfaces leads to effective charge separation (ECS), serving as the origin of ‘cellular electrical activity’. The stochastic interactive chemical equilibriums of DRS with components in the fluid (ADP, Pi, and others) are characterized by an observable new type of stochastic, hormetic and idiosyncratic ‘outside active center’ mechanism/kinetics. In conjunction with coacervate organization, murburn could maintain discrete ion and solute differentials across ‘islets’ of different phases without ion-pumping or deterministic electron transport chains. Murburn-type reactions within pre-biotic coacervates afforded powering, coherence, homeostasis, electro-mechanical features and sensing/responding abilities (PCHEMS: the ‘instant’ functions of life), later supplemented and propagated by deterministic genetic means (central dogma) in cellular systems. As murburn (with ECS-DRS as core physiology) and coacervation rooted cellular PCHEMS since life’s origin (evidenced currently by the incorporation of convoluted lipid-membrane enriched structures of mitochondria and chloroplasts as the bioenergetic micro-organelles) and sustained it thereafter, normal aging, disease, evolution and termination must be understood in the new framework. Further, this write-up provides a viable thermodynamic rationale for DRS-radiation connectivity in routine/pathological cellular functions.

Some intervals of the Jurassic–Cretaceous strata of the Anabar-Lena sedimentary basin have a certain oil and gas production potential, which can be realized in the synchronous offshore horizons of the adjacent territories of the Arctic shelf. Among the most representative objects in this regard are the outcrops of Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous formations of the Nordvik Peninsula. The main data on the composition and structure of this section were obtained mainly at the beginning of the second half of last century. The results of complex mineralogical, petrographic, and lithochemical studies of the Urdyuk-Khaya and Paksa formations of Cape Urdyuk-Khaya of the Nordvik Peninsula presented in here enabled us to identify 10 boundaries for changing of sedimentation regimes of the paleobasin. It was found that the Urdyuk-Khaya Formation was formed mainly in the conditions of the shelf transition zone (moderate deep water) with low rates of terrigenous material intake, some depletion of oxygen in bottom waters, and a trend towards an increase in the depths of the basin. The basal stratum of the Paksa Formation was formed in offshore conditions with periodically occurring dioxic conditions in bottom waters and extremely low rates of terrigenous material intake. The overlying part of the formation was formed in various parts of offshore transition conditions with a gradual decrease in the depths of the basin, an increase in the oxygen content in the bottom layer of water, and the rate of terrigenous material intake. The main provenance area was igneous rocks of mafic, possibly intermediate composition. There was some influence of felsic igneous rocks, or ancient sedimentary rocks rich in quartz. The parent strata were subjected to moderate and severe chemical weathering, in a warm humid climate. The revealed features of the studied strata are similar to the characteristics of the same-age sediments of the lower reaches of the Anabar River, which determines their high correlation potential and allows us to judge the evolution of the western part of the Anabar-Lena basin.

Carbon, with its high electrical conductivity and large surface area, enables the efficient dispersion and utilization of catalytic entities, contributing to the cost-effective development of electrochemical systems for a future energy economy. However, the longevity of these systems is often compromised by carbon corrosion, the fundamental details of which unfortunately remain largely unknown. Here, we elucidate that carbon corrosion is initiated by a covalent addition reaction that chemically breaks the sp2 carbon network, prior to electrochemical oxidation steps. Online differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and post-mortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy unveil the pseudozeroth- and first-order reaction kinetics in the proton concentration and oxygen coverage on the carbon surface, respectively, allowing us to suggest acid-catalyzed hydration with carbocation formation as the initial step in carbon corrosion. The proposed mechanism is further evidenced by the decreased carbon corrosion rate in the presence of the carbocation scavenger, methanol, and by the evolution of the C18O16O product during the corrosion of carbon, pretreated in acid solution prepared with the 18O-isotope of water. Based on these findings, previous empirical understandings, pH-dependent and site-specific (defect, edge, etc.) carbon corrosion characteristics, can be successfully explained, bringing potential avenues for developing rational strategies to mitigate carbon corrosion.

Desert environments harbor unique microbial communities. This study focuses on Cellulosimicrobium funkei isolate RVMD1, isolated from rock varnish in the Ma’an Desert. Initial identification was achieved using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for comprehensive characterization. The genome comprises 4,264,015 base pairs (857 contigs) with a high G + C content of 74.59%. A total of 4,449 proteins were predicted. Comparative analysis utilizing OrthoANI, ANI, AAI, and dDDH metrics suggests that RVMD1 belongs to the C. cellulans group, with the highest similarity to C. funkei (97.71% ANI). Phylogenomic analysis of 43 Cellulosimicrobium genomes revealed significant heterogeneity within the genus. Our results challenge current systematics, with C. cellulans potentially representing up to 9 distinct genomospecies. Isolate RVMD1 shows genetic adaptations to its desert environment, including genes for denitrification, oxygen and sulfur cycling, and diverse hydrogen metabolism. Pangenomic analysis uncovered a considerable number of unique genes within RVMD1, highlighting its genetic distinctiveness. Gene family expansions suggest evolution in response to stressors like UV radiation and nutrient limitation. This study represents the first whole-genome analysis of a bacterium isolated from Jordanian rock varnish, emphasizing the value of WGS in understanding microbial diversity and adaptation in extreme environments.

Plant class III peroxidases (PRXs) catalyze generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidation of various compounds including lignin precursors. PRXs function in cell wall metabolism, defense, and stress responses. However, gene redundancy and catalytic versatility have impeded detailed functional characterization of PRX genes. The genome of the model moss Physcomitrium patens harbors a relatively small number (49) of PRX genes. Conserved architecture of four exons and three ‘001’ introns, found in some algal PRX genes and in the PpPRX family, suggests that this architecture predated divergence of the green algal and land plant lineages. The PpPRX family expanded mainly through whole-genome duplications. All duplicated pairs but one were under purifying selection and generally exhibited similar expression profiles. An expanded phylogenetic tree revealed a conserved land plant-wide clade that contained PRXs implicated in stress responses in non-lignifying cells, providing a clue to ancient functions of land plant PRXs. Functional clustering was not observed, suggesting convergent evolution of specific PRX functions (e.g., lignification) in different plant lineages. With its small complement of PRXs, P. patens may be useful for functional characterization of land plant PRXs. Several PpPRXs were proposed for further study, including PpPRX34 and PpPRX39 in the ancient land plant-wide clade.

Low-temperature stress significantly impacts plant growth, development, yield, and geographical distribution. However, during the long-term process of evolution, plants have evolved complicated mechanisms to resist low-temperature stress. The cold tolerance trait is regulated by multiple pathways, such as the Ca 2+ signaling cascade, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1)-C-repeat binding factor (CBF)-cold-reulated gene (COR) transcriptional cascade, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis regulation, and plant hormone signaling. However, the specific responses of these pathways to cold stress and their interactions are not fully understood. This review summarizes the response mechanisms of plants to cold stress from four aspects, including cold signal perception and transduction, ICE1-CBF-COR transcription cascade regulation, ROS homeostasis regulation and plant hormone signal regulation. It also elucidates the mechanism of cold stress perception and Ca 2+ signal transduction in plants, and proposes the important roles of transcription factors (TFs), post-translational modifications (PTMs), light signals, circadian clock factors, and interaction proteins in the ICE1-CBF-COR transcription cascade. Additionally, we analyze the importance of ROS homeostasis and plant hormone signaling pathways in plant cold stress response, and explore the cross interconnections among the ICE1-CBF-COR cascade, ROS homeostasis, and plant hormone signaling. This comprehensive review enhances our understanding of the mechanism of plant cold tolerance and provides a molecular basis for genetic strategies to improve plant cold tolerance.

The formation of H2 by introducing ultrasonic waves to liquid has been widely recognized as a way to provide a clean, efficient, and reliable source of H2, known as Sono-Hydro-Gen. H2 comes from the chemical effects of ultrasonic waves (sonochemistry) caused by the growth and collapse of acoustic cavitation bubbles. In this work, the effects of dynamic parameters (i.e., bubble temperature, the amount of water vapor trapped inside the bubble, and collapse time) in the evolution of cavitation bubbles on H2 production are studied numerically. For an oxygen bubble, computational simulations are performed for the wide range of acoustic amplitudes (1.5–3 atm), ultrasonic frequencies (140–515 kHz), and ambient radii (0.25–20 μm), considering 22 reversible chemical reactions and 10 chemical species inside the bubble. The numerical results show that the amount of water vapor has a significant effect on the bubble collapse temperature. At low excitation amplitudes, the amount of water vapor is not enough to cause the bubble to form a strong collapse. Nevertheless, at high excitation amplitudes, the amount of water vapor is too much to reduce the bubble temperature. There exist optimal values of bubble temperature and amount of water vapor for H2 production. The optimal bubble temperatures are 5267, 4813, 4626, and 3856 K, corresponding to H2 productions of 4.21 × 10−18, 1.29 × 10−18, 2.61 × 10−19, and 8.48 × 10−20 mol, respectively, at ultrasonic frequencies of 140, 213, 355, and 515 kHz. No matter what the excitation parameters are, the optimal water vapor fraction is 0.78 ± 0.04 for H2 production. The obtained results of the present work can provide guidelines for H2 production in acoustic cavitation.

Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) is highly toxic to microbes. However, the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and metabolic regulation within anaerobic guilds remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of environmentally relevant levels of polypropylene (PP)-MPs/NPs on oxidative stress and microbial ecology during anaerobic digestion (AD). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that PP-MPs/NPs elevated the concentrations of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and derived hydroxyl radicals (•OH). EPFRs were identified as the primary contributors to •OH generation, as evidenced by a high Spearman correlation coefficient (r = 0.884, p < 0.001) and free radical-quenching studies. The formation of •OH enhanced ROS production by 86.2–100.9%, resulting in decreased cellular viability and methane production (by 37.5–50.5%) at 100 mg/g TS PP-MPs/NPs. Genome-centric metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses suggested that PP-MPs/NPs induced the reassembly of community structures, re-evolution of functional traits, and remodeling of interspecies interactions. Specifically, PP-MPs/NPs induced a shift in methanogen consortia from hydrogenotrophic Methanofollis sp. to acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic Methanothrix soehngenii, primarily because of the latter's diverse ingestion patterns, electron bifurcation complexes, and ROS-scavenging abilities. Downregulation of genes associated with antioxidative defense systems (i.e., sodN, katA, and osmC) and ROS-driven redox signal transduction pathways (c-di-AMP and phosphorylation signaling pathways) provided insights into the mechanisms underlying ROS-induced microbial metabolic dysregulation. Our findings enhance the understanding of microbial ecological and metabolic traits under MPs/NPs stressors, facilitating the control of MPs/NPs toxicity and the stabilization of AD processes.

ABSTRACT A novel catalyst material named Pd/UiO‐66(Zr)‐2OH was successfully developed and applied in a hydrogen‐promoted Fenton system for the efficient catalytic oxidation of the widely used antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP). The UiO‐66(Zr)‐2OH, as the carrier of catalyst in this work, was synthesized through a solvothermal method. The Pd 0 nanoparticle, as the active center of the catalyst, was loaded onto its surface by the “ship‐in‐a‐bottle” strategy. The results showed that the composite Pd/UiO‐66(Zr)‐2OH demonstrated excellent catalytic performance during the reaction, achieving over 97% of TMP removal efficiency within 180 min under optimal conditions under the condition of only trace of iron without adding H 2 O 2 . This may be attributed to the fact that the [H], as a clean and efficient reducing agent, can be utilized to accelerate the regeneration of Fe 2+ in the Fenton reaction, as well as in the in‐situ regeneration of H 2 O 2 . The key parameters affecting the removal efficiency of TMP, including the initial pH and concentration of Fe 2+ , the dosage of the synthesized material, the flow rate of H 2 and the stirring speed were investigated systematically. The Pd/UiO‐66(Zr)‐2OH exhibited high stability and reusability, maintaining over 82% of its initial degradation efficiency of TMP after six reaction cycles. The mechanistic insight revealed that the system primarily relied on the generation of hydroxyl radical (·OH) and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) for the degradation of TMP, which was verified through quenching experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR). The degradation pathway of TMP was elucidated by analyzing intermediates and the reduction in total organic carbon (TOC). This research offers novel conceptual insights into the evolution and application of advanced oxidation technologies, efficient degradation of emerging pollutants, and expansion of pathways for hydrogen resource utilization.

(1−3) Professor Haoshen Zhou from Nanjing University, China, has been selected as the 2024 PIER in the field of batteries and energy storage for his outstanding contribution to the area of high energy density secondary battery materials and systems. (4) We are honored to have the opportunity to celebrate his outstanding contributions in this special issue (SI).Professor Haoshen Zhou received his bachelor's degree in semiconductor physics from the Department of Physics at Nanjing University in 1985, master's degree in 1988 from the Nanjing Institute of Electronic Devices, and Ph.D. in chemical engineering in the School of Engineering at The University of Tokyo, Japan, in 1994. After his Ph.D. study, he pursued a further 3 years of postdoctoral training at RIKEN in Japan. In 1997, Professor Haoshen Zhou joined the Energy Interface Department of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, to pursue energy-related scientific research. He was promoted to a professor-level senior researcher in 2004 and became the chief senior researcher in AIST's Energy Department in 2011. During his tenure in Japan, Professor Zhou led numerous projects funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and the Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO). In 2012, he joined Nanjing University's College of Engineering and Applied Sciences as a full professor. Professor Zhou established the Department of Energy Science and Engineering and Center of Energy Storage Materials & Technology, where he served as their inaugural chairs. He was also appointed as a Yangtse Distinguished Professor by the Chinese Ministry of Education (2010). He held concurrent appointments as a special professor at The University of Tokyo and University of Tsukuba in Japan. Professor Zhou has served as an associate editor of Science Bulletin and Energy Storage Materials as well as an expert in charge of the National Key R&D Program's "Smart Grid Key Project" in China. During 2014–2018, he was the chief scientist for China's National Key Research Program in Nanotechnology. Professor Zhou received the "Lihua Yi" Chemical Innovation Award from the Chinese Chemical Society (2023) and the First Prize from the Chinese Materials Research Society (2024). Over his career, Professor Zhou has mentored more than 80 postdoctoral fellows and doctoral students, of which many have grown into emerging leaders in their respective research areas.Professor Haoshen Zhou has long been dedicated to the innovation and engineering of new high-energy-density battery systems and key materials. He established the reaction theory for high-capacity air electrodes, invented solid-state batteries based on sieving electrolytes, and developed and expanded the combined electrolyte battery system. As a corresponding author, he has published over 500 research papers and is a holder of over 80 authorized patents. Professor Zhou is a pioneer in the field of lithium–oxygen batteries, proposed a comprehensive mechanism for oxygen anion redox energy storage, and designed new high-energy-density lithium batteries. (5−9) Zhou and his team creatively introduced the "Li2O–Li2O2" oxygen anion redox process for charge storage, offering advantages such as high coulombic efficiency, good reversibility, and mild stability for the battery system. (6) He also discovered the critical role of trace amounts of H2O in enhancing the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) processes in organic electrolytes, proposing a synergistic catalytic mechanism between H2O molecules and Ru/SP/MnO2 cathodes, leading to breakthrough in lithium–air batteries. (7) Building upon the oxygen anion redox energy storage mechanism, he designed various highly efficient catalysts (e.g., Ir and Ni) to expand the reversible capacity of the cathode and suppress oxygen evolution. (6,8) Professor Zhou also proposed a concentrated dual-salt LiFSI–LiNO3/DOL electrolyte to improve the high-rate performance of lithium metal anodes, delivering stable operation for 240 cycles at 8.0 mA cm–2 and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.14%. (9) He also invented a closed lithium–oxygen battery with a lithium metal anode and high-capacity Li2O cathode, achieving a practical specific energy of 513 Wh kg–1 and a charge–discharge cycle life exceeding 200 cycles. (8) Professor Zhou summarized the essential criteria for redox mediators (RMs) to function as catalysts in lithium–air batteries and revealed the catalytic mechanism of these soluble catalysts during the charging process: (1) 2RM– + 2e– = 2RM+ and (2) 2RM+ + Li2O2 = 2Li+ + O2 + 2RM. (10) This theory led to his pioneering use of trichloroethyl chloroformate (TCCF) as a soluble catalyst for not only significantly reducing the overpotential of the OER but also greatly enhancing the reaction rate of the oxygen electrode. (11) The innovation improved the rate performance of lithium–oxygen batteries by over 10 times, with the cathode achieving a discharge specific capacity of 2005 mAh g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1.Professor Haoshen Zhou has also made groundbreaking contributions to the study of lithium–carbon dioxide (Li–CO2) batteries, high-energy-density batteries without lithium anodes, and development of new battery systems. He introduced in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to the study of CO2 electrode reactions, proposing the reaction mechanism for the reversible reduction and evolution of CO2 at the air electrode interface: 3CO2 + 4e– + 4Li+ = 2Li2CO3 + C. (12) He further introduced molten salt electrolytes, which verified the reversible reaction pathway of CO2 at the air electrode, reduced the electrode overpotential, and significantly improved the energy storage efficiency of the battery. (13) Professor Zhou and his team were the first to propose a lithium supplementation mechanism based on the OER of Li2O, successfully addressing the issue of capacity degradation caused by lithium loss during charge and discharge cycles. (14) A prototype anode-free lithium-ion battery with a layered transition metal oxide cathode was designed and operated, achieving a specific energy of 320 Wh kg–1 and a cycle life of 300 cycles. Professor Zhou also creatively introduced the concept of a combined electrolyte, constructed from "organic electrolytes", "lithium-ion solid electrolytes", and "aqueous electrolytes", integrating the characteristics of two or more electrolytes to design multiple energy conversion systems, leading to the invention of a high-capacity lithium–air battery and a technology for directly extracting elemental lithium from seawater. (15) The pioneering concept of combined electrolytes further led to the demonstration of an electrolytic cell system that has achieved both lithium extraction from seawater (or brine) and conversion of electrical energy into the chemical energy of lithium as a new energy storage solution. (16)Professor Zhou and his team further expanded the concept of combined electrolytes to integrate molecular sieves or framework compounds with organic electrolytes for successfully mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions on the anode surface, enhancing the stability of high-capacity lithium secondary batteries at high voltages (greater than 5.2 V versus Li/Li+) and elevated temperatures (100 °C). (17) This achievement is significant for expanding the application scenarios of electrolytes in high-output voltage systems and improving the energy density of various battery configurations. Professor Zhou then introduced the Cu3(BTC)2 metal–organic framework (MOF) as a selective electrolyte in lithium–sulfur battery systems for effectively preventing polysulfide ions from shuttling to the lithium metal side, significantly reducing capacity loss with an average capacity decay of only 0.019% over 1500 cycles. (18) He also invented a polypropylene ultrathin membrane modified with MOFs that greatly enhances the cycle life of lithium metal battery systems while increasing energy density, achieving a specific energy of 354 Wh kg–1 and 80% retention of its initial capacity after 200 cycles.

(29) Bai et al. demonstrated an in situ self-assembly strategy where metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) grew on a polypropylene separator. This MOF-based separator achieves permselective ion transport and regulation behavior, which effectively suppresses the nucleation and growth of Li dendrites. (30)Sodium-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 7 papers (3 reviews and 4 articles) are on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). SIBs have great potential for large-scale energy storage devices due to the high abundance, wide distribution, and non-toxicity of the resource. Li et al. reviewed the phase transition in layered oxide cathodes, pointing out the intrinsic causes and degradation mechanisms of phase transition for SIBs. They summarize the mainstream strategies to inhibit the phase transition, such as elemental doping, surface coating, and structural modification as well as the novel strategy of introducing anionic redox, providing new comprehension in understanding the phase transition of layered oxides. (31) Wang et al. presented a thorough discussion of the current research progress on layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) beginning with an explanation of the structure characteristics of P- and O-phase cathode materials. Three primary modification strategies are outlined to address the challenges faced by LTMOs: element doping, surface coating, and structure design. (32) Li et al. collated recent advances and fundamental design principles of organic electrolytes in terms of sodium salts, solvents, and functional additives. They also discuss the crucial challenges for SIBs, including high operating voltage, wide working temperature range, and fast charge rate.

(37)Zinc-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 3 papers (1 review and 2 articles) are on zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). ZIBs are viewed as promising grid-level energy storage solutions due to their high theoretical specific capacity (820 Ah kg–1 and 5855 Ah L–1), low electrochemical potential, ample geological resources, and compatibility with water. Zhang et al. comprehensively overviewed the functional role of the electrolyte additive in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs), including regulating the solvation structure, altering the H-bond network, forming an adsorption layer, generating an electrostatic shielding effect, and constructing a solid electrolyte interphase. The development prospects and existing problems of additives are also presented. (38) Wang et al. introduced certain MnSO4 into the ZnSO4 + K2SO4 hybrid electrolyte (Zn0.5K0.25) to improve the AZIBs. MnSO4 in the hybrid electrolyte facilitates the porous MnO2 electrodeposition on PBAs, resulting in an increased contact area at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics. (39) Yu et al. introduced a cost-effective copper sulfate additive, enabling the creation of a multifunctional Cu–Zn alloy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the zinc anode.

The sulfur content in dense molecular regions is highly depleted in comparison to diffuse clouds. The reason for this phenomenon is unclear, and it is therefore necessary to carry out observational studies of sulfur-bearing species toward dense regions, mainly in early evolution stages. In this context, the analysis of sulfur-bearing molecules in a large sample of dense starless molecular cores is of great importance to help us uncover the early sulfur chemistry in these regions. From the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data archive, we selected a project in Band 7 (275--373 GHz), which contains the emission of several sulfur-bearing species. The observations were performed toward a sample of 37 dense cores that are embedded in the most massive infrared-quiet molecular clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. The lines of 34SO, SO$_ $, NS, SO, SO$^ $, and H$_ $CS were analyzed, and the column densities of each molecular species were obtained. Based on the continuum emission and two CH$_ $OH lines, the 37 cores were characterized in density and temperature, and the corresponding H$_ $ column densities were derived. The abundances of these sulfur-bearing species were derived and studied. We find that the abundances of the analyzed sulfur-bearing species increase with increasing gas temperature. Based on the correlation between abundances and temperature, we suggest that the chemistry involved in the formation of each of the analyzed molecules may similarly depend on T$_ k $ in the range 20 to 100 K. Additionally, we find that the comparisons among abundances are highly correlated in general. Taking into account that this correlation decreases in more evolved sources, we suggest that the sulfur-bearing species we analyzed have a similar chemical origin. Our observational results show that the X(SO$_ $)/X(SO) ratio can be used as a chemical clock of molecular cores. Based on the line widths of the molecular lines, we point out that molecules with an oxygen content (34SO, SO$_ $, SO, and SO$^ $) may be associated with warmer and more turbulent gas than the other molecules. H$_ $CS and NS are associated with more quiescent gas, probably in the external envelopes of the cores, which trace similar physical and chemical conditions. We complement recent similar works done toward more evolved sources with a large sample of sources, but also provide quantitative information about abundances that might be useful in chemical models for explaining the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium.

Sometimes, such a gene flow could have played a role in modulating their capability to cope with a variety of selective pressures, thus resulting in archaic adaptive introgression events. A paradigmatic example of this evolutionary mechanism is offered by the EPAS1 gene, whose most frequent haplotype in Himalayan highlanders was proved to reduce their susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness and to be introduced in the gene pool of their ancestors by admixture with Denisovans. In this study, we aimed at further expanding the investigation of the impact of archaic introgression on more complex adaptive responses to hypobaric hypoxia evolved by populations of Tibetan/Sherpa ancestry, which have been plausibly mediated by soft selective sweeps and/or polygenic adaptations rather than by hard selective sweeps. For this purpose, we used a combination of composite-likelihood and gene network-based methods to detect adaptive loci in introgressed chromosomal segments from Tibetan WGS data and to shortlist those presenting Denisovan-like derived alleles that participate to the same functional pathways and are absent in populations of African ancestry, which are supposed to do not have experienced Denisovan admixture. According to this approach, we identified multiple genes putatively involved in archaic introgression events and that, especially as regards TBC1D1, RASGRF2, PRKAG2, and KRAS, have plausibly contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and of certain cardiovascular traits in high-altitude Himalayan peoples. These findings provided unprecedented evidence about the complexity of the adaptive phenotype evolved by these human groups to cope with challenges imposed by hypobaric hypoxia, offering new insights into the tangled interplay of genetic determinants that mediates the physiological adjustments crucial for human adaptation to the high-altitude environment. Introduction The scientific community currently agrees that the Homo sapiens species experienced admixture with extinct Hominins since traces of such inbreeding events are still detectable in the genomes of modern humans (Gouy and Excoffier, 2020). In fact, people belonging to non-African populations show 1–2% of Neanderthal ancestry (Green et al., 2010; Prüfer et al., 2014), while Melanesians and East-Asians present 3% and 0.2% of Denisovan ancestry, respectively (Reich et al., 2010; Meyer et al., 2013; Prüfer et al., 2014; Racimo et al., 2017). Despite evidence supporting selection against introgressed alleles has been collected (Simonti et al., 2016; Racimo et al., 2017; McArthur et al., 2021), some of the genomic segments showing signatures ascribable to archaic introgression were also proved to have been targeted by natural selection in modern human populations, thus providing examples for the occurrence of adaptive introgression (AI) events (Racimo et al., 2017). So far, several studies have indeed identified introgressed archaic alleles at high frequency in human genes involved in metabolism or in the response to environmental conditions, such as temperature, sunlight, and altitude (Prüfer et al., 2014; Vernot and Akey, 2014; Sankararaman et al., 2014; Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Gittelman et al., 2016; Racimo et al., 2017; Enard and Petrov, 2018; Dannemann and Racimo, 2018). Moreover, some genes that play a role in immune responses to pathogens are found to be characterized by a similar pattern of variability (Laurent et al., 2011; Enard and Petrov, 2018) and certain Neanderthal alleles have been shown to be associated with down-regulation of gene expression in brain and testes (McCoy et al., 2017; Racimo et al., 2017; Dannemann and Racimo, 2018). These works collectively attest how genetic variants introduced in the human gene pool by admixture with archaic species can significantly impact our biology by possibly comporting modifications in the modulation of several functional pathways. In particular, the high frequency of some archaic alleles in protein-coding and/or regulatory genomic regions suggests a possible adaptive role for Neanderthal and/or Denisovan variants, pointing to a further evolutionary mechanism having potentially contributed to the processes of human biological adaptation to different environmental and cultural settings. By introducing new alleles in the gene pool of a given population, admixture in fact provides a very rapid opportunity for natural selection to act on it (Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Jeong et al., 2014; Racimo et al., 2015; Hamid et al., 2021) and this is supposed to have likely occurred during the evolutionary history of H. sapiens, particularly after the last Out of Africa migration in the late Pleistocene (Sugden, 2018; Vahdati et al., 2022). According to this view, gene flow from extinct Hominin species could have facilitated the adaptation of H. sapiens populations to peculiar Eurasian environments. For instance, a Denisovan origin of the adaptive EPAS1 haplotype, which confers reduced susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness to Tibetan and Sherpa highlanders (Beall, 2007; Bigham et al., 2010; Yi et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011) is well established (Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021). However, the hard selective sweep experienced in high-altitude Himalayan populations by the EPAS1 introgressed haplotype has been demonstrated to account only for an indirect aspect of their adaptive phenotype, which does not explain most of the physiological adjustments they evolved to cope with hypobaric hypoxia (Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2018). Therefore, how far gene flow between Denisovans and the ancestors of Tibetan/Sherpa peoples facilitated the evolution of other key adaptive traits of these populations remains to be elucidated. To fill this gap, and to overcome the main limitation of most approaches currently used to test for AI (i.e., inferring archaic introgression and the action of natural selection separately by means of different algorithms, which increases the risk of obtaining biased results due to confounding variables), we assembled a dataset of whole-genome sequences (WGSs) from 27 individuals of Tibetan ancestry living at high altitude (Cho et al., 2017; Jeong et al., 2018) and we analysed it using a composite-likelihood method specifically developed to detect AI events at once (Setter et al., 2020). Notably, this method was designed to recognize AI mediated by subtle selective events (as those involved in polygenic adaptation) and/or soft selective sweeps, which represent the evolutionary mechanisms that are supposed to have played a more relevant role than hard selective sweeps during the adaptive history of human groups characterized by particularly small effective population size, such as Tibetans and Sherpa (Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2018). Coupled with validation of the identified putative adaptive introgressed loci through (1) the assessment of the composition of gene networks made up of functionally related DNA segments presenting archaic derived alleles that are absent in human groups which are supposed to do not have experienced Denisovan admixture, such as African ones, (2) the confirmation that natural selection targeted these genomic regions in populations of Tibetan ancestry, and (3) the quantification of genetic distance between modern and archaic haplotypes, such an approach provided new evidence about the biological functions that have mediated high-altitude adaptation in Himalayan populations and that have been favourably shaped by admixture of their ancestors with Denisovans. Results Spatial distribution of genomic variation and ancestry components of Tibetan samples After quality control (QC) filtering of the available WGS data, we obtained a dataset made up of 27 individuals of Tibetan ancestry characterized for 6,921,628 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). To assess whether this dataset represents a reliable proxy for the genomic variation observable in high-altitude Himalayan populations, we merged it with genome-wide genotyping data for 1086 individuals of East-Asian ancestry belonging to both low- and high-altitude groups (Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2017; Landini et al., 2021). We thus obtained an extended dataset including 231,947 SNVs (Supplementary file 1a), which was used to perform population structure analyses. Results from ADMIXTURE and principal components analysis (PCA) were found to be concordant with those described in previous studies (Jeong et al., 2014; Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2017; Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2021). According to the ADMIXTURE model showing the best predictive accuracy (K = 7) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), the examined WGS exhibited a predominant genetic component that was appreciably represented also in other populations speaking Tibeto-Burman languages, such as Tu, Yizu, Naxi, Lahu, and Sherpa (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Such a component reached an average proportion of around 78% in individuals of Tibetan ancestry from Nepal included in the extended dataset, as well as of more than 80% in the subjects under investigation, who live in the Nepalese regions of Mustang and Ghorka (Figure 1A, B). This suggests that after their relatively recent migration in Nepalese high-altitude valleys, these communities might have experienced a higher degree of isolation and genetic drift with respect to populations that are still settled on the Tibetan Plateau, in which the same ancestry fraction did not exceed 64% (Figure 1A, B). Nevertheless, the overall ADMIXTURE profile of the considered WGS appeared to be quite comparable to those inferred according to genome-wide genotyping data for other Tibetan populations (Figure 1A, B, Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Similarly, PCA pointed to the expected divergence of Tibetan and Sherpa high-altitude groups from the cline of genomic variation of East-Asian lowland populations (Abdulla et al., 2009; Jeong et al., 2014; Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2022; Figure 1C). Remarkably, the WGS under investigation clustered within the bulk of genome-wide data generated for other groups from the Tibetan Plateau, thus supporting their representativeness as concerns the overall genetic background of high-altitude Himalayan populations.

(A) Admixture analysis showed the best predictive accuracy when seven (K = 7) population clusters were tested. Populations included in the dataset are labelled according to population names and acronyms reported in Supplementary file 1a. (B) Map showing geographic location and admixture proportions at K = 7 of the high-altitude groups included in the extended dataset. The label Tibetans_WG indicates whole-genome sequence data for individuals of Tibetan ancestry analysed in the present study. Additional information about the considered samples (e.g., number of individuals per group, reference study, and used abbreviations) are reported in Supplementary file 1a. (C) Principal components analysis (PCA) plot considering PC1 vs PC2 and summarizing genomic divergence between high-altitude Tibetan/Sherpa people and the cline of variation observable for lowland East-Asian populations. The enlarged square displays clustering between Tibetan samples sequenced for the whole genome (i.e., blue dots) and Tibetan samples characterized by genome-wide data (i.e., light-blue squares). Detecting putative AI signatures in Tibetan genomes To identify genomic regions showing signatures putatively ascribable to AI events, we scanned Tibetan WGS with the VolcanoFinder algorithm and we computed the composite likelihood ratio (LR) and −logα statistics for each polymorphic site (Setter et al., 2020). We then considered the most significant results by focusing on loci showing LR values falling in the positive tail (i.e., top 5%) of the obtained distribution (see Materials and methods, Supplementary file 1b). According to such an approach, we were first able to recapitulate the AI event previously described for the EPAS1 gene (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A; Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). In fact, this chromosomal interval was found to be characterized by a remarkable number of variants (N = 19) showing significant LR scores, as well as by high overall values of −logα (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), suggesting, respectively, the plausible archaic origin of many alleles at this gene and an appreciable action of natural selection on it. Five of these significant SNVs have been already described as Denisovan-like derived alleles at outstanding frequency (i.e., ranging between 0.96 and 1) in Tibetans but not in other modern human populations (Supplementary file 1c; Zhang et al., 2021). On the contrary, at the genomic region encompassing EGLN1 (which we have considered as a negative control for AI, see Materials and methods) we detected high −logα values coupled with a low number of SNVs (N = 3) showing significant LR scores, with only one being remarkably above the adopted significance threshold (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and Supplementary file 1d). Overall, these findings are concordant with evidence from literature that suggest adaptive evolution of both EPAS1 and EGLN1 loci in high-altitude Himalayan populations (Yang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2022), although only the former was proved to have been impacted by archaic introgression (Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). Moreover, we were able to confirm other introgression signatures previously inferred from WGS data for populations of Tibetan ancestry, such as those involving the PRKCE gene and the MIRLET7BHG long non-coding region, which are located in the overlapping upstream chromosomal intervals, respectively, of EPAS1 and PPARA (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B). In line with what reported for EPAS1, also PPARA has been already proposed to play a role in the modulation of high-altitude adaptation of Himalayan human groups (Simonson et al., 2010; Horscroft et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). Interestingly, AI signatures identified by VolcanoFinder in the MIRLET7BHG locus extended also in the PPARA gene, as well in its downstream region (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A), supporting the findings described by Hu et al., 2017. Finally, we observed patterns comparable to those at EPAS1 and PPARA for 10 additional genomic regions that were differentially pointed out by previous studies as Tibetan and/or Han Chinese DNA segments potentially carrying introgressed Denisovan alleles (Hu et al., 2017; Browning et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Figure 2A, B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, Supplementary file 1e). Figure 2 with 4 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Distribution of VolcanoFinder statistics suggestive of putative adaptive introgrossed loci across the TBC1D1 and PRKAG2 genomic regions. On the x-axis are reported genomic positions of each single-nucleotide variant (SNV), while on the y-axis are displayed the related statistics obtained. Pink background indicates the chromosomal interval occupied by the considered genes, while the grey background identifies those genes (i.e., PGM2 in the TBC1D1 downstream genomic region and the RHEB gene in the upstream PRKAG2 region) possibly involved in regulatory transcription mechanisms. The dashed red line identifies the threshold set to filter for significant likelihood ratio (LR) values (i.e., top 5% of LR values). For both these genomic regions, the distribution of LR and −logα are concordant with those observed at the EPAS1 positive control for adaptive introgression (AI). (A) A total of 50 significant LR values (red stars) and −logα (grey diamonds) values resulted collectively elevated in both the TBC1D1 gene and its downstream genomic regions. A remarkable concentration of significant LR values characterizing 19 SNVs was especially observable in the first portion of the gene. (B) The entire PRKAG2 genomic region was found to comprise 46 SNVs showing significant LR values, with the greatest peaks being located in the downstream region associated to such gene. Peaks detected for the LR statistic are accompanied by peaks of −logα values. Validating genomic regions affected by archaic introgression To validate signatures of archaic introgression at the candidate AI loci identified with VolcanoFinder, we relied on the approach described by Gouy and Excoffier, 2020. In detail, we used the Signet algorithm to identify networks of genes participating to the same functional pathway and presenting archaic-like (i.e., Denisovan) derived alleles observable in the putative admixed group (i.e., Tibetans) but not in an outgroup of African ancestry (i.e., Yoruba, YRI), by assuming that only Eurasian H. sapiens populations experienced Denisovan admixture (see Materials and methods). After having crosschecked results from the VolcanoFinder and Signet analyses, we identified six gene networks that turned out to be consistently significant across all the Signet runs performed and that included a total of 15 genes pointed by VolcanoFinder as candidate AI loci (Supplementary file 1f). Four of these loci composed the gene network overall ascribable to the Pathways in Cancer biological functions, which included also the EPAS1 positive control for AI (Figure 3A). Most of the other genes supported by both the analyses were instead observed in significant networks belonging to the Ras signalling and AMPK signalling pathways (Supplementary file 1f). Figure 3 Download asset Open asset Significant gene networks including Denisovan-like derived alleles according to the Signet analysis. (A) Schematic representation of the activation of the RAS/MAPK(ERK) axis after interaction of the bradykinin receptors with their ligands (e.g., ANG II) within the framework of the Pathways in Cancer network. Genes supported by both Signet (i.e., belonging to the significant network associated to Pathways in cancer) and VolcanoFinder (i.e., including at least a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) showing likelihood ratio (LR) value within top 5% of the obtained results) analyses as potentially introgressed loci, are highlighted in red and present solid outline. Grey circles with dotted-dashed contour instead indicate genes supported only by Signet, while loci marked with stars are those including genomic windows showing LASSI T statistic within top 5% of the related distribution. After the interaction between ANG II (active enzyme angiotensin II) and bradykinin receptors, activation of the Ras protein encoded by KRAS mediated by RAS-GTPases (e.g., RASGRF2) comports a series of phosphorylation reactions that eventually promotes angiogenesis (Kranenburg et al., 2004). In detail, phosphorylation of the MAPK1 protein and prevention of MAPK1-DAPK-1-dependent apoptosis leads to increased MAPK1 activity (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Stevens et al., 2007) that causes improved FOS mRNA expression (Monje et al., 2005). FOS together with other proteins (e.g., Jun) forms the AP-1 transcription factor, which bounds to the VEGF promoter region upregulating its expression in endothelial cells (Catar et al., 2013) and sustaining angiogenesis when the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signalling cascade is inhibited (Lorenzo et al., 2014). (B) Gene network built by setting co-expression as force function and by displaying the entire set of genes identified by the Signet algorithm as belonging to significant pathways including Denisovan-like derived alleles. Genes whose variation pattern was supported by both VolcanoFinder and Signet analyses (e.g., TBC1D1) as shaped by archaic introgression are displayed with a solid black outline. The EPAS1 positive control locus that has been previously proved to have mediated adaptive introgression in Tibetan populations was represented as light-blue octagonal. Genes included in pathways involved in angiogenesis (e.g., RASGRF2) and/or activated in hypoxic conditions (e.g., PRKAG2) are reported as dark red and light-blue circles, respectively, while the remining fraction of significant genes are represented as light-grey circles. The closeness or the distance between all nodes reflects the tendency to be co-expressed with each other and all the connections inferred are characterized by a confident score ≥0.7. Interestingly, gene networks belonging to the Pathways in Cancer and Ras signalling pathway appeared to be tightly related from a functional perspective because included oncogenes that promote the initiation and progression of tumour growth by stimulating cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Kranenburg et al., 2004). In particular, according to the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database KRAS and RASGRF2 genes from the Ras signalling network were found to contribute also to the Pathways in Cancer functions (Figure 3A), especially by interacting with the identified candidate introgressed loci PLCB1, RASGRP2, DAPK1, MAPK1, FOS, and VEGFA to modulate the VEGF signalling pathway, which is activated in hypoxic conditions and induces the transcription of genes that promote angiogenesis (Figure 3A; Maxwell and Ratcliffe, 2002; Kranenburg et al., 2004). Also, the AMPK signalling pathway is known to be activated in different cell types by stresses such as deprivation of oxygen and/or glucose, leading to the inhibition of energy-consuming biosynthetic pathways (e.g., protein and glycogen synthesis) and to the activation of ATP-producing catabolic pathways, such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Chen et al., 2018; Dengler, 2020). No significant gene networks involving the EGLN1 genomic region considered as a negative control for AI were instead reconstructed with the Signet approach (Supplementary file 1f), suggesting that the very few variants at this locus that showed VolcanoFinder LR scores above the adopted significant threshold might represent false positive results (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and Supplementary file 1d). Shortlisting introgressed genomic regions characterized by adaptive evolution To further shortlist the most robust candidate genes involved in AI events, we applied the LASSI algorithm to phased Tibetan WGS data with the aim of searching for genomic signatures ascribable to the action of natural selection (Harris and DeGiorgio, 2020) (see Materials and methods). This enabled us to confirm the strong selective events occurred at the EPAS1 and EGLN1 genes, as previously reported by multiple studies conducted on high-altitude Himalayan populations (Beall et al., 2010; Yi et al., 2010; Simonson et al., 2010; Horscroft et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021), as well as to corroborate adaptive evolution of some of the genes pointed out by both VolcanoFinder and Signet analyses. In fact, several chromosomal intervals associated to these loci presented values of the computed T statistic that fall within the top 5% of the related distribution (Figure 4C, D, Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2C, D, Figure 4—figure supplement 3C, D). Figure 4 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Representation of genetic distances between modern and archaic haplotypes and barplots showing haplotype frequency spectra for TBC1D1 and RASGRF2 candidate adaptive introgression (AI) genes. Haplotypes are reported in rows, while derived (i.e., black square) and ancestral (i.e., white square) alleles are displayed in columns. Haplotypes are ranked from top to bottom according to their number of pairwise differences with respect to the Denisovan sequence. (A) Heatmap displaying divergence between Tibetan, CHB and YRI TBC1D1 haplotypes with respect to the Denisovan genome. A total of 33 TBC1D1 haplotypes (i.e., 61% of the overall haplotypes inferred for such a region) belonging to individuals with Tibetan ancestry are plotted in the upper part of the heatmap thus presenting the smallest number of pairwise differences with respect to the Denisovan sequence. (B) Heatmap displaying divergence between Tibetan, CHB and YRI RASGRF2 haplotypes with respect to the Denisovan genome. A total of 16 Tibetan haplotypes in the RASGRF2 genomic region present no differences with respect to the Denisovan sequence. As regards barplots, on the x-axis are reported the haplotypes detected in the considered genomic windows, while on the y-axis is indicated the frequency for each haplotype. The black and dark-grey bars indicate the more frequent haplotypes (i.e., the putative adaptive haplotypes inferred by the LASSI method), while red stars mark those haplotypes carrying Denisovan-like derived alleles. (C) TBC1D1 haplotype frequency spectrum. The TBC1D1 gene presents a haplotype pattern qualitatively comparable to that observed at EPAS1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A), with a predominant haplotype carrying archaic derived alleles and reaching elevated frequencies in Tibetan populations. In line with this observation, such a pattern was inferred by LASSI as conformed with a non-neutral evolutionary scenario, even if it seems to be characterized by a soft rather than a hard selective sweep due to the occurrence of three sweeping haplotypes. (D) RASGRF2 haplotype frequency spectrum. A soft selective sweep was inferred also for the considered RASGRF2 genomic window, although frequencies reached by the sweeping haplotypes turned out to be more similar with each other. The second most represented haplotype was that carrying the archaic derived alleles and, reached a frequency of 29% in the Tibetan group. More in detail, in addition to EPAS1, genomic windows associated to the DAPK1, GNG7, AK5, TBC1D1, PLCB1, RASGRF2, and PRKAG2 introgressed loci supported by both VolcanoFinder and Signet approaches were found to present scores within the top 5% of the T distribution, suggesting that their haplotype diversity was appreciably shaped by positive selection. Interestingly, adaptive evolution of the TBC1D1 and RASGRF2 genes has been previously proposed by studies conducted on different populations of Tibetan ancestry (Peng et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2023). Estimating genetic distance between modern and archaic sequences As a final step for prioritizing the most convincing AI genes supported by VolcanoFinder, Signet, and LASSI approaches, as well as to explicitly test whether the Denisovan human species represented a plausible source of archaic alleles for them, we merged Tibetan WGS data with those from low-altitude Han Chinese (CHB) and YRI populations sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Auton et al., 2015), and with the Denisovan genome. We then used the Haplostrip algorithm (Marnetto and Huerta‐Sánchez, 2017) to estimate genetic distance between modern and archaic haplotypes at the candidate AI genes reported in the previous paragraph. We especially considered genomic windows that included Denisovan-like derived alleles and that presented values of the likelihood T statistic supporting an adaptive evolution (see Materials and methods). Among the tested putative AI loci, TBC1D1, RASGRF2, PRKAG2, and KRAS were found to present substantial proportions of Tibetan haplotypes that cluster close to the Denisovan sequence, thus showing the lowest numbers of pairwise differences with respect to it as compared with CHB or YRI haplotypes (Figure 4A, B, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B). More in detail, 61% of the TBC1D1 Tibetan haplotypes turned out to be the nearest ones to the archaic sequence by entailing only two pairwise differences with respect to it (Figure 4A), while 29% of Tibetan haplotypes inferred for the RASGRF2 gene were even identical to the Denisovan DNA (Figure 4B). Interestingly, both these chromosomal intervals were classified by the LASSI method as regions whose variation pattern was conformed with the soft selective sweep model, presenting three potential adaptive haplotypes (i.e., those haplotypes that plausibly carry putative advantageous alleles and thus increased in frequency due to positive selection). At each gene, one of these haplotypes was found to contain the Denisov
