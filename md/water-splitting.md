High‐performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components in energy conversion and storage technologies. Yet, their poor reversibility hinders their applicability. A highly active ORR/OER catalyst, consisting of multiwalled carbon nanotubes‐supported MnFeNiOx nanoparticles, was subjected to sequences of chronoamperometric steps alternating between the ORR, the OER and highly cathodic potentials (Ec). Rotating ring disk electrode methods revealed that applying Ec leads to a small increase in the current and peroxide species yield during the ORR while enhancing substantially the OER. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy showed irreversible changes in the chemical state of MnFeNiOx correlating with its catalytic properties. The complexity of changes that a composite catalyst may undergo under varying potentials, the importance of monitoring product formation, and the convenience of using dynamic electrochemical sequences for the assessment of catalyst reversibility, as well as for the activation and/or restoration of their catalytic properties are highlighted.

Developing cost-effective, efficient and stable air cathodes, involving oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER), is the crux of the large-scale application of reversible Zinc-air batteries. Herein, 1D/2D hierarchical N doping carbon architecture encapsulating FeCo nanoalloys were successfully constructed by one-step annealing leaf-like ZnFeCo-ZIFs. Benefiting from the unique 1D/2D hierarchical porous feature with high specific surface area, sufficient accessible catalytic sites, not easy entanglements and efficient electron and mass transfer capacity, as well as the advantages of the strong electronic coupling in FeCo alloys, the as-prepared FeCo@1D-CNTs/2D-NC catalysts exhibited prominent bifunctional oxygen catalytical performances with a positive half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.87 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) for the oxygen reduction reaction and a low overpotential (η10 = 396 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 for the oxygen evolution reaction, manifesting a low reversible potential gap (ΔE = 0.756 V). The zinc-air battery equipped with FeCo@1D-CNTs/2D-NC as the cathode catalyst exhibited a higher peak power density (98.2 mW cm–2) and specific capacity (741 mAh gZn–1) than that assembled with the commercial Pt/C This study provides a convenient strategy to explore non-precious metal based bifunctional electrocatalysts for reversible Zinc-air battery scale applications.

Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activated by metal oxides has been developed as a promising approach for advanced oxidation processes in the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater; however, rapid and effective activation of PMS still lacks reasonable catalyst-oriented design. Here, by fabricating a Co3O4–La2O3 bimetallic oxide electrode to implement defect engineering, we report an oxygen vacancy (OV)-mediated PMS activation electrocatalytic system for degradation of tetracycline (TC). The rare earth metal oxide La2O3 was used to modify Co3O4 and introduce OVs as active sites, where PMS is activated to produce reactive species. OVs in the Co3O4–La2O3 composites facilitate the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2), which mediates the activation of PMS via a non-radical pathway. When the ratio of Co to La was 2:1, the system Co3O4–La2O3/PMS had a degradation efficiency for TC of more than 97.50% and a mineralization rate of up to 62.97% within 40 min. Overall, the findings on the defect-engineered materials for antibiotic degradation could provide an effective strategy for the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater with low energy consumption and pollution.

Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extremely important to sustainable energy conversion and storage, but improved efficiency is largely hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics. Dense and bimetal ruthenates have emerged as one of the promising substitutes to replace single-metal ruthenium or iridium oxides, but the fundamental understanding the role of A-site cations is still blurring. Herein, a family of lanthanides (Ln = all the lanthanides except Pm) are applied to synthesize pyrochlore lanthanide ruthenates (Ln2Ru2O7), and only Ln2Ru2O7 (Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, or Lu) with pure phase can be obtained by the ambient-pressure calcination. Compared with the perovskite ruthenates (SrRuO3) and rutile RuO2, the [RuO6] units in these Ln2Ru2O7 present the largely distorted configurations and different energy level splitting to prevent the excessive Ru oxidation and dissolution, which leads the primary improvement in the electrocatalytic OER performance. In the similar crystalline field split states, the charge transfer between [RuO6] units and Ln3+ cations also affect catalytic activities, even in the Ln2Ru2O7 surface reconstruction during the OER process. Consequently, Tb2Ru2O7 showed the highest OER performance among all the prepared Ln2Ru2O7 with similar morphologies and crystallization. This systematic work gives fundamental cognition to rational design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts in proper water electrolysis technologies.

Oxygen vacancy (OVac) and interface engineering are effective tactics for regulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts and optimizing the absorption/desorption of reactants and intermediates on the catalyst surface to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a self-supported electrocatalyst, comprising δ-MnO2 nanosheets grown on Co single atoms (CoSAs) anchored on N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) embedded with Co nanoparticle on a carbon cloth (CC) (δ-MnO2/CoNP@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC), was fabricated. Through in-situ growth of δ-MnO2 nanosheets on CoNP@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC, the number of OVac is increased, as proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Positron annihilation lifetime spectrometer (PALS), due to the redox between MnO2 and Co. Experimental results and theoretical calculations confirm that the formation of OVac rich δ-MnO2 nanosheets and the construction of heterogeneous interface between δ-MnO2 and CoSAs-NCNTs endow the electrocatalyst with good conductivity, fast charge transfer, and multiple active sites, leading to rapid OER reaction kinetics. Therefore, the δ-MnO2/CoNP@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC electrocatalyst demonstrates remarkable OER performance, requiring only 165 mV overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline solution.

To develop the high-efficiency and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is very important and challenging for the rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The sluggish ion/electron transport kinetics observed during the OER and ORR processes with the Co2P electrocatalyst can be attributed to the strong binding force between the surface Co atoms and the adsorbed intermediates. Herein, the electronic structure optimization is conducted to enhance the ORR and OER electrocatalytic activities of Co2P nanoparticles by doping iron ions. The results show that the Fe doping enable adjust the electronic structure of the Co atom and lower the energy barrier of RDS. Compared with Co2P@NCNT, the (Co0.90Fe0.10)2P@NCNT exhibit higher onset and half-wave potential (0.92 and 0.85 V vs. RHE, respectively) during the ORR process, and lower overpotential (380 mV, the current density is 10 mA∙cm−2) during the OER process. As expected, the ZABs base on (Co0.90Fe0.10)2P@NCNT electrocatalyst display an outstanding specific capacity (928.50 mAh∙g−1Zn), and an excellent peak power density (246.8 mW∙cm−2). This promising work may contribute to the fabrication of efficient electrocatalyst for ZABs.

In recent years, researchers have been actively investigating metal oxide-based materials with narrow bandgaps due to their potential applications toward wastewater treatment and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). In this study, we successfully synthesized g-C3N4 (GCN), Fe2O3, and Fe2O3/g-C3N4 (FGCN) using thermal polymerization and hydrothermal methods. We characterized the physicochemical and structural properties of these materials through various analytical techniques including XRD, FT-IR, UV-DRS, XPS, FE-SEM, and HR-TEM analyses, confirming the effective construction of the FGCN composite catalyst. We evaluated the photocatalytic activity of Fe2O3, GCN, and FGCN composite catalysts by assessing their ability to degrade rhodamine B (RhB) and crystal violet (CV) by exposing them to sunlight for 150 min. Among these catalysts, the FGCN composite demonstrated excellent photocatalytic performance, achieving 93 % and 95 % degradation of RhB and CV, respectively, under 150 min of sunlight exposure. The developed Fe2O3/g-C3N4@Nickel foam (FGCN@NF) composite catalyst exhibits remarkable OER performance, with a reduced Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec and a low overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and shows excellent durable performance over a long time (15 h). Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analysis confirmed the mineralization of both dyes. The photocatalytic performance remained largely unchanged after five consecutive experiments, demonstrating excellent reusability and photostability. Trapping experiments revealed that O2●– is the main species responsible for the photocatalytic decomposition of various dyes by the FGCN composite catalyst. Therefore, the development of a versatile photo/electrocatalytic system that can efficiently promote energy conversion in environmental applications has attracted great attention.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays an important role in many electrocatalysis-related fields. However, the slow kinetics of the OER seriously hinders energy efficiency. Here, we synthesize flower-like Co–Fe–Cr–Mo medium-entropy spinel (MES) nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) using one-step solvothermal method for the OER. Due to high stability and compositional diversity, the CoFeCrMoOx/NF catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic OER performance with an overpotential of only 196 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in 1.0 M KOH solution, much lower than CoFeCrMnOx/NF, CoFeCrCeOx/NF, CoFeCrSnOx/NF, CoFeCrAlOx/NF, and commercial IrO2 catalysts, reflecting that the formation of flower-like MES has a positive effect on the improvement of OER performance. The introduction of Mo increases active sites, promotes electron transfer, accelerates the adsorption and desorption of the OER intermediates, reduces the energy barrier, and thus improves the performance of the OER. In situ Raman spectra indicate that the surface CoOOH and FeOOH species are important active components for the OER.

Abstract The bifunctional air electrodes with numerous dual-active sites and low cost are desirable to modify the performance of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Metal–oxygen-nitrogen–carbon substrate (M = Mn, Fe, Ni, etc.) and NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets are excellent catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, respectively. Here, we investigated a bifunctional electrocatalytic substrate with 3D core-shell hierarchical architecture by anchoring high OER-active NiFe-LDH on ORR-active FeMnZIF-8@gC3N4-derived FeMnON-N doped carbon nanotubes with bamboo like (NiFe-LDH@FeMnON-NC). This nano composite has unique features such as robust synergistic effects, high conductivity, balance, and optimization of surface chemical valences of Fe, Mn, and Ni atoms to boost the bifunctional ORR and OER properties and stability in ZABs. The NiFe-LDH@FeMnON-NC nanocomposite not only exhibited superior OER electroactivity with a low onset overpotential of 235 mV (10 mA cm−2), but also have excellent ORR activity with current density of -5.48 mAcm-2 and onset potential of 1.04 V, which is better than or comparable to those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2. Rechargeable ZABs constructed by bifunctional NiFe-LDH@FeMnON-NC have a peak power density (235.41 mW cm−2), open-circuit potential (OCV) (1.53 V), small discharge/charge band gap of 0.74 V and excellent discharge stability.

The implementation of water electrolysis technology is hampered by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction. In an attempt to solve this issue, anodes which are able to respond to external stimuli such as magnetic field and light were successfully prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, using Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (FTO/Fe3O4) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles together with tetrathiafulvalene as photosensitizer (FTO/Fe3O4/TTF). This technique allowed obtaining highly stable and homogeneous anodes in a simple and reproducible way. The electrodes produced a catalytic effect on the water oxidation reaction, without the use of a noble-metal, and proved to be sensitive to a 365 nm LED light as well as to an external magnetic field. Water oxidation reaction was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry, by the Tafel slopes and also by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work presents new perspectives for the water oxidation reaction, using electrodes fabricated by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and catalyzed through the use of external stimuli such as light and magnetic fields.

Identifying a universal activity descriptor for metal oxides, akin to the d‐band center for transition metals, remains a significant challenge in catalyst design, largely due to the intricate electronic structures of metal oxides. This review highlights a major advancement in formulating the number of excess electrons (NEE) as an activity descriptor for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on reducible metal oxide surfaces. We elaborate on the quantitative relationship between NEE and the adsorption properties of OER intermediates, and unveil the decisive role of the octet rule on the OER performance of these oxides. This insight provides a robust theoretical basis for designing effective OER catalysts. Moreover, we discuss critical experimental evidence supporting this theory and summarize recent advances in employing NEE as a guiding principle for developing highly efficient OER catalysts experimentally.

Transition metal hydroxides have great potential as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, while its low reaction kinetics and unsatisfactory stability limits the further application. Herein, Co(OH)2 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies defects and anchored Ir atoms and clusters (Ir/D-Co(OH)2) were prepared by electrochemical deposition and in-situ etching. The Introduction of Ir species is beneficial to regulate the valence electron configuration on Co 3d orbit and enhance the conductivity, which contributes to improving kinetics of Co(OH)2. In addition, the introduced defects not only regulate the adsorption energy barrier of reaction intermediates, but also serve as anchor centers for stabilizing Ir atoms and clusters, thus enhancing the active surface area and catalytic stability. The Ir/D-Co(OH)2/NF catalyst owns ultralow OER potential of 270.5 mV at 100 mA cm-2, and it has superior long-term stability under high current density of 100 mA cm-2 for 100 hours. This work provides a simple method to design noble atoms loaded transition metal hydroxides with specific defects for enhancing OER performance and high stability.

Unique designs and doping strategies were adopted to control the variability of intrinsic active sites and to enhance the catalytic performance of bimetal catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study introduces the fabrication of unique cage-structured NiFe-W-PBN oxide catalysts (u-NFWPBNO) through a facile stepwise reduction process. The two-step metal reduction, employing H4N2·H2O followed by NaBH4, yields a cage structure (120 nm) featuring an uneven shell surface composed of small nanospheres (25 nm). Outstanding OER performance is achieved, which can be attributed to the P, B, N tri-doping strategy including both geometric and electronic structural changes. Furthermore, the introduction of tungsten (W) results in electron withdrawal at the metal centers. P, B and P, N dual-doped catalysts with different morphologies (NFWPBO, NFWPNO) and W-free (NFPBNO) comparison groups were prepared to compare these features. Consequently, u-NFWPBNO exhibits overpotentials of 256 mV for j10 and a Tafel slope of 32 mV/dec, demonstrating high performance. This study serves as a valuable guide for preparing uniquely designed, high-activity amorphous electrocatalysts and provides insights for developing Zn-air batteries.

Developing the facile, universal and scale-up method to prepare electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is crucial for the high-efficient hydrogen production through water splitting. Herein, we load the CeO2 nanoparticles on the various metal foams by a very simple and scalable impregnation method. Taking iron-nickel foam (INF) as an example, we can obtain a high-efficient OER and MOR electrocatalyst of CeO2@INF-0.6. CeO2@INF-0.6 shows the superior electrocatalytic activities toward both OER and MOR with the oxidation potentials of 1.52 V and 1.47 V at 100 mA cm-2, respectively. This can be ascribed to the CeO2@INF-0.6 with strong adsorption and fast conversion ability of OH- in the alkaline electrolyte. CeO2@INF-0.6 also has good stability and selectivity in MOR-assisted alkaline water splitting, and the Faraday efficiency of formate is up to 99.2% at 1.42 V (vs. RHE). In addition, the Na+ and Cl- ions with high concentrations almost have the negligible effects on the OER and MOR activities of our CeO2@INF-0.6 in the alkaline solution. This indicates that using CeO2@INF-0.6 as anode for seawater electrolysis not only can greatly reduce the energy consumption, but produce the value-added anode product of formate.

Abstract Metal–support interaction (MSI) is witnessed as an essential manner to stabilize active metals and tune catalytic activity for heterogonous water splitting. Kinetically driving the water electrolysis (WE) appeals for a rational MSI system with the coupled electron‐donating/accepting (e‐D/A) characters for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). However, the metal stabilization effect by MSI will in turn restrict the deblocking of e‐D/A properties and challenge the full electrocatalytic optimization. This study profiles a heterostructure featuring metastable Ru clusters on defective NiFe hydroxide (Ru/d‐NiFe LDH) support as a low‐precious (≈2 wt%) catalytic platform for efficient WE. It is indicated that the interfacial oxygen vacancies can deviate the stable Ru 4d 5 orbit to a metastable Ru 2+δ state, and regulate the metal d‐band center levels toward the facilitated HER/OER processes. Resultantly, the Ru/d‐NiFe LDH heterostructure attains the ultralow overpotentials at 10 mA cm −2 for Pt‐beyond alkaline HER (18 mV) and OER (220 mV) with fast kinetics and durability. The symmetrical water electrolyzer delivers a promising voltage of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH and efficient seawater splitting performance. This work carries interesting opportunities in rationalizing sophisticated metal‐support electrocatalysts through metal‐site metastabilization engineering.

Hydroxide ion (OH−) adsorption is an important step in promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. This study aims to design a rational catalyst to obtain several OH− adsorption sites to achieve excellent OER performance: NiO was selected as the main catalyst, and a Co0.1Ni0.9O catalyst was prepared with 10 % lattice substitution of Co2+ ions. The Co0.1Ni0.9O surface was capsulated with amorphous carbon to prevent corrosion by strong alkaline media. XPS analysis revealed that Ni2+ ion defects occurred in the Co0.1Ni0.9O crystal, and highly oxidized Ni3+ ions were mixed to attain the desired stoichiometric ratio. Electrophilic Ni2O3 in a highly oxidized state promotes attack from OH− ions, which is a nucleophile, and easily transforms into a NiOOH intermediate, which ultimately leads to the rapid progress of OER. That is, the strong covalent nature between Ni3+−O2− in the Co0.1Ni0.9O/CP electrode promotes charge transfer between the cationic metal surface and the OH− adsorbate, thereby accelerating OER. Moreover, C-capsulation in the Co0.1Ni0.9O particles reduces the band gap owing to the filling of the electrons from C between the Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals. Consequently, this improved the conductivity of the electrode, effectively reducing the ohmic potential drop and energy loss between the catalyst and the current collector. Therefore, the overpotential reached by this electrode at 10 mA cm−2 was greatly reduced to 332 mV, the Tafel slope was low at 91.98 mV dec−1, and during OER with a Faraday efficiency of 94.7 %. Moreover, this excellent performance remained stable even after 10 d.

Poly(heptazine imides) (PHIs) have emerged as prominent layered carbon nitride-based materials with potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity owing to their strong VIS light absorption, long excited-state lifetimes, high surface-to-volume ratios, and the possibility of tuning their properties via hosting different metal ions in their pores. A series of metal-ion-doped PHI-M (M = K+, Rb+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) were first systematically explored using density functional theory calculations. These simulations led an in-depth understanding of the microscopic OER mechanism in these systems and identified PHI-Co2+ as the best OER catalyst of this family of PHIs, whereas PHI-Mn2+ can be an alternative promising OER catalyst. This level of performance was attributed to a thermodynamically favorable formation of the reaction intermediates as well as its red-shifted absorption in the VIS region involving the population of long-lived states, as revealed by time-dependent density functional theory calculations. We further demonstrated that the electronic properties of the *OH intermediates (Bader population, crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis, and adsorption energies) are reliable descriptors to anticipate the OER activity of this family of PHIs. This rational analysis paved the way toward the prediction of the OER performance of another PHI-M derivative, i.e., PHI-Fe2+. The computationally explored PHI-Fe2+, PHI-Mn2+, and PHI-Co2+ systems were then synthesized alongside PHI-K+, and their photocatalytic OER activities were assessed. These experimental findings confirmed the best photocatalytic OER performance for PHI-Co2+ with an oxygen production of 31.2 μmol·h–1 that is 60 times higher than the pristine g-C3N4 (0.5 μmol·h–1), whereas PHI-Fe2+ and PHI-Mn2+ are seen as alternative OER catalysts with attractive oxygen production of 11.20 and 4.69 μmol·h–1, respectively. Decisively, this joint experimental–computational study reveals PHI-Co2+ to be among the best of the OER catalysts so far reported in the literature including some perovskites.

Hybrid water electrolysis is a prominent route for hydrogen production that circumvents issues related to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the anode process in conventional water electrolysis, by integrating an alternative anode reaction. Herein, samples of nickel oxide nanoparticles supported on oxygen and nitrogen-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes were evaluated as electrocatalysts for the OER and the electrooxidation of methanol (MOR), ethanol (EOR) and glycerol (GOR). The trend of overpotentials measured at a current of 0.1 mA was OER>MOR>EOR>GOR, with slightly lower overpotentials observed for the nitrogen-doped sample, which is attributed to differences in nanoparticle size and distribution, support defectiveness, and nitrogen-induced electronic effects. The production of oxygen was monitored by Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS), indicating that the competition between OER and alcohol electrooxidation can be modulated by the support properties as well as by the nature and concentration of the alcohol.

In recent years, a series of noble metals and transition metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been explored for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The unique structural and electronic features of the SACs facilitate the OER with maximum atomic utilization. As a result, a high turnover frequency is achieved with SACs. In this chapter, we have summarized the fundamentals of the SACs and their design strategies for electrochemical OER. The detailed characterization of the SACs and its utilization in OER has been discussed with suitable examples. The principles and reaction mechanism of electrochemical OER with SACs have been discussed looking at the structure of the active catalyst and reaction intermediates.

The excessive consumption of fossil energy causes serious environmental problems, which has driven the exploration of clean and sustainable energy. Oxygen electrocatalysis as the core reaction of emerging energy conversion has attracted significant attention. Fe-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) are efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis on account of high intrinsic reaction activity, maximized metal atom utilization, well-defined active sites, customizable coordination environment, and regulable electronic structure. Although considerable performance improvements for Fe-based SACs in the oxygen electrocatalysis process have been made, the principle of modifying the electronic structure to promote the catalytic performance of Fe-based SACs is still ambiguous. In this review, the authors systematically summarize the regulation tactics for optimizing the catalytic activity and durability of Fe-based SACs toward oxygen electrocatalysis through different electronic structure adjustment methods, including the modulation of coordination atoms, metallic regulation, and the substrate effect. Ultimately, the challenges and future perspectives in the further development of Fe-based SACs are proposed.

Experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters are rarely reported for electrocatalytic reactions including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, they contain unique and valuable mechanistic insight and present a missing link to theoretical investigations. Herein, a protocol for determining thermodynamic properties of the rate determining state and intermediate (RDSI) of the OER is presented. Cobalt oxide is investigated at pH 7 as a case study. Two different approaches are employed: steady state polarization (SSP) that uses chronopotentiometry at different temperatures and current values, and potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) at different DC voltages and temperatures. The data is used to fit a 3D plane from which entropy and enthalpy of the RDSI are obtained. The data analysis requires an appropriate filtering of the data. Hence, we discuss suitable figures of merit for establishing appropriate filtering criteria. The values obtained are 0.72 and ‐0.39 eV (at 298 K) for enthalpic and entropic contributions, respectively. The obtained values are reproducible for both approaches and consistent with literature.

The efficiency of green hydrogen production is reduced due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition to the optimal catalyst properties, electrocatalytic activity also depends on the interaction of the electrocatalyst with the electrolyte. Here, we show that the addition of small amounts of Li+ to Fe‐free NaOH or KOH electrolytes activates NiFeOOH for the OER compared to single‐cation electrolytes. Moreover, the activation was maintained when the solution was returned to pure NaOH. Importantly, we show that the origin of activation by Li+ cations is primarily non‐kinetic in nature, as the OER onset for the mixed electrolyte does not change and the Tafel slope at low current density is ~30 mV/dec in both electrolytes. However, the increase of the apparent Tafel slope remains lower at increasing current densities in the presence of Li+. Based on electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and in situ X‐Ray Absorption Spectroscopy measurements, we show that this reduction of non‐kinetic effects is due to enhanced intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide in the Li+ activated catalyst. This enhanced electrolyte penetration facilitates the OER, especially at higher current densities and for increased catalyst loading, which is important for industrial electrolyzer systems.

The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an arduous step in water splitting due to its slow reaction rate and large overpotential. Herein, we synthesized glycerate-anion-intercalated nickel–iron glycerates (NiFeGs) using a one-step solvothermal reaction. We designed various NiFeGs by tuning the molar ratio between Ni and Fe to obtain Ni4Fe1G, Ni3Fe1G, Ni3Fe2G, and Ni1Fe1G, which we tested for their OER performance. We initially analyzed the catalytic performance of powder samples immobilized on glassy carbon electrodes using a binder. Ni3Fe2G outperformed the other NiFeG compositions, including NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). It exhibited an overpotential of 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 in an electrolytic solution of pH 14. We then synthesized carbon paper (CP)-modified Ni3Fe2G as a self-supported electrode (Ni3Fe2G/CP), and it exhibited a high current density (100 mA cm−2) at a low overpotential of 300 mV. The redox peak analysis for the NiFeGs revealed that the initial step of the OER is the formation of γ-NiOOH, which was further confirmed by a post-Raman analysis. We extensively analyzed the catalyst’s stability and lifetime, the nature of the active sites, and the role of the Fe content to enhance the OER performance. This work may provide the motivation to study metal-alkoxide-based efficient OER electrocatalysts that can be used for alkaline water electrolyzer applications.

Although metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are now a hot candidate for improving the kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), direct application of them is challenging due to their poor intrinsic conductivity and internal active sites. Here, we successfully introduced halogen atoms into the octahedral topological structure of Ni based MOF materials, achieving an impressive improvement in OER activity. Accordingly, the as-obtained halogen-containing Ni based MOF ball-flowers (X-Ni-MOF BFs, X = F, Cl, Br and I) exhibit significantly enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity with an increase in electronegativity. The optimal F-Ni-MOF BFs possess an ultra-low overpotential of 222 mV at 10 mA cm−2, ∼70 mV lower than Ni-MOF nanosheets. Further research demonstrates that the introduction of halogen atoms can cause NiO6 octahedral distortion and strong electronic interactions between halogen and the adjacent Ni atoms, resulting in rapid reaction kinetics and lower electron transfer barriers. This work provides a reference for designing excellent electrocatalysts by adjusting their topological structure.

Abstract A microscopic understanding of how Fe-doping of Co(OH) 2 improves electrocatalytic oxygen evolution remains elusive. We study two Co 1-x Fe x (OH) 2 series that differ in fabrication protocol and find composition alone poorly correlates to catalyst performance. Structural descriptors extracted using X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy reveal element-specific distortions in Co 1-x Fe x (OH) 2 . These structural descriptors are composition-dependent within individual sample series but inconsistent across fabrication protocols, revealing fabrication-dependence in catalyst microstructure. Correlations between structural parameters from different techniques show that Fe-O resists bond length changes, forcing distortion of Co environments. We find the difference in O-M-O bond angles between Co and Fe sites to correlate with electrocatalytic behavior across both sample series, which we attribute to asymmetric distortion of potential energy surfaces for the Co(III) to Co(IV) oxidation. A Tafel slope consistent with a rate-limiting step without electron transfer emerges as the O-Co-O angle decreases, implying a distortion-induced transition in rate-limiting step. The fabrication dependence of electronic and bonding structure in the catalysts should be considered in theoretical and high-throughput analyses of electrocatalyst materials.

Developing efficient oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) made from earth-abundant elements is extremely important since the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with sluggish kinetics hinders the development of many energy-related electrochemical devices. Herein, an efficient strategy is developed to prepare conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with abundant and uniform coordination sites by coupling the N-rich organic monomer 2,4,6-tris(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (TBPT) with Co(II) porphyrin. The resulting CMP-Py(Co) is further metallized with Co2+ ions to obtain CMP-Py(Co)@Co. Structural characterization results reveal that CMP-Py(Co)@Co has higher Co2+ content (12.20 wt %) and affinity toward water compared with CMP-Py(Co). Moreover, CMP-Py(Co)@Co exhibits an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 285 mV vs RHE at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 80.1 mV dec–1, which are significantly lower than those of CMP-Py(Co) (335 mV vs RHE and 96.8 mV dec–1). More interestingly, CMP-Py(Co)@Co outperforms most reported porous organic polymer-based OECs and the benchmark RuO2 catalyst (320 mV vs RHE and 87.6 mV dec–1). Additionally, Co2+-free CMP-Py(2H) has negligible OER activity. Thereby, the enhanced OER activity of CMP-Py(Co)@Co is attributed to the incorporation of Co2+ ions leading to rich active sites and enlarged electrochemical surface areas. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Co2+-TBPT sites have higher activity than Co2+-porphyrin sites for the OER. These results indicate that the introduction of rich active metal sites in stable and conductive CMPs could provide novel guidance for designing efficient OECs.

In the realm of renewable energy technologies, the development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts is paramount, especially for applications like electrochemical water splitting. This research focuses on synthesizing a novel bimetallic metal‐organic framework (BMMOF11) using earth‐abundant elements, cobalt (Co) and cadmium (Cd). BMMOF11 showcases a distinctive structure with distorted octahedral chains of CoO and CdO, linked by benzene tricarboxylic acid (BTC). Our study primarily investigates the electrocatalytic efficiency of BMMOF11, particularly in water oxidation reactions. For practical analysis, BMMOF11 was anchored onto nickel foam, forming BMMOF11/NF, to evaluate its electrocatalytic properties. Electrochemical testing revealed that BMMOF11/NF begins water oxidation at an onset potential of 1.62 V versus RHE, demonstrating high activity with a lower overpotential of 0.4 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm². Moreover, BMMOF11/NF maintained stable water splitting performance, sustaining a current density of approximately 70 mA/cm2 under a voltage of 1.9 V relative to RHE. These findings indicate that BMMOF11/NF is a promising candidate for large‐scale electrochemical water splitting, offering a blend of high activity and stability

The development of highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on more cost-effective and earth-abundant elements is of great significance and still faces a huge challenge. In this work, a series of transition metal (TM) embedding a new-defined monolayer carbon nitride phase is theoretically profiled and constructed as a catalytic platform for OER studies. Typically, a four-step screening strategy was proposed to rapidly identified high performance candidates and the coordination structure and catalytic performance relationship was thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the eliminating criterion was established to condenses valid range based on the Gibbs free energy of OH*. Our results reveal that the as-constructed 2FeCN/P exhibits superior activity toward OER with an ultralow overpotential of 0.25 V, at the same time, the established 3FeCN/S configuration performed well as a bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysis with extremely lower overpotential ηOER/ηORR of 0.26/0.48 V. Overall, this work provides an effective framework for screening advanced OER catalysts, which can also be extended to the complex multistep catalytic reactions.

Transition metal-based precatalysts are typically voltage-activated before electrochemical testing in the condition of alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. Nevertheless, the impact of voltage on the catalyst and the anion dissolution is frequently disregarded. In this study, Fe-doped NiMoO4 (Fe-NiMoO4) was synthesized as a precursor through a straightforward hydrothermal method, and MoFe-modified Ni (oxygen) hydroxide (MoFe-NiOxHy) was obtained via cyclic voltammetry (CV) activation. The effects of voltage on Fe-NiMoO4 and the dissolved inactive MoO42− ions in the process were examined in relation to OER performance. It has demonstrated that the crystallinity of the catalyst is reduced by voltage, thereby enhancing its electrocatalytic activity. The electron distribution state can be adjusted during the application of voltage, leading to the generation of additional active sites and an acceleration in the reaction rate. Additionally, MoO42− exhibits potential dependence during its dissolution. In the OER process, the dissolution of MoO42− enhances the reconstruction degree of Fe-NiMoO4 into the active substance and expedites the formation of active Ni(Fe)OOH. Hence, the optimized MoFe-NiOxHy exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic performance, with a current density of 100 mA cm−2 achieved at an overpotential of only 256 mV. This discovery contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of alkaline OER performance under the influence of applied voltage and the presence of inactive oxygen ions, offering a promising avenue for the development of efficient electrocatalysts.
