Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical‐aberration‐corrected microscope, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin‐polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70 mV at 150 mA cm‐2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin‐polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen‐involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.

Abstract Reconstruction of catalysts is now well recognized as a common phenomenon in electrocatalysis. As the reconstructed structure may promote or hamper the electrochemical performance, how to achieve the designed active surface for highly enhanced catalytic activity through the reconstruction needs to be carefully investigated. In this review, the genesis and electrochemical effects of reconstruction in various electrochemical catalytic processes, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), and nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) are first described. Then, the strategies for optimizing the reconstruction, such as valence states control, active phase retention, phase evolution engineering, and surface poisoning prevention are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the general rules of reconstruction optimization are summarized and give perspectives for future study. It is believed that the review shall provide deep insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms and guide the design of pre‐catalysts with highly improved activity.

Abstract The construction of highly efficient and self‐supported electrocatalysts with abundant active sites for pH‐universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alkaline water splitting is significantly challenging. Herein, Co and MoC nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen‐doped carbon nanofibers (Co‐MoC/NCNFs) which display a bamboo‐like morphology are prepared by electrospinning followed by the carbonization method. The electrospun MoC possesses an ultrasmall size (≈5 nm) which can provide more active sites during electrocatalysis, while the introduction of Co greatly optimizes the electronic structure of MoC. Both endow the Co‐MoC/NCNFs with superior HER performances over a wide pH range, with low overpotentials of 86, 116, and 145 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline, acidic, and neutral media, respectively. Additionally, the catalyst exhibits remarkable alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 254 mV to reach 10 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory calculations confirm that electron transfer from Co to MoC regulates the adsorption free energy for hydrogen, thereby promoting HER. Moreover, an electrolyzer assembled with Co‐MoC/NCNFs requires only a cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH. This work opens new pathways for the design of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.

Abstract Converting solar energy into electrochemical energy is a sustainable strategy, but the design of photo‐assisted zinc–air battery (ZAB) with efficient utilization of sunlight faces huge challenges. Herein, a photo‐assisted ZAB of a three‐electrode system using MoS 2 /oxygen vacancies‐rich TiO 2 heterojunction as charge cathode and Fe, N‐doped carbon matrix (FeNC) as discharge cathode is constructed, where MoS 2 is chosen as solar light‐responsive catalytic material and TiO 2 acts as electron transport layer and hole blocking layer, arising from a train of thought for efficient charging under sunlight irradiation and light‐independent discharging. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 facilitates the temporary trapping of carriers and triggers rapid carrier transfer at the interface of the heterojunction, which hinders the recombination of photogenerated holes, thereby facilitating their further participation in the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, FeNC exhibits superior oxygen reduction reaction performance due to strong d‐π interactions. As a result, the well‐built ZABs deliver a low charge voltage (0.71 V) under illumination at 0.1 mA cm −2 , and a high power density (167.6 mW cm −2 ) in dark. This work paves a special way for the development of ZABs by directly harvesting solar energy in charging and efficiently discharging regardless of lighting conditions.

Abstract The development of an excellent multifunctional electrocatalyst that is based on non‐precious metal is critical for improving the electrochemical processes of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in alkaline media. This study demonstrates that incorporating Mo into Co 3 O 4 facilitated the formation of rich oxygen vacancies (Vo), which promotes effective nitrate adsorption and activation in urea electrolysis. Subsequently, in situ/operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy is used to explore the active sites in Mo‐Co 3 O 4 ‐3 under OER, indicating the oxygen vacancies are first filled with OH • in Mo‐Co 3 O 4 ; facilitated the pre‐oxidation of low‐valence Co, and promoted the reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediate Co‐OOH • . Mo‐Co 3 O 4 ‐3 electrocatalysts show impressive HER, OER, and UOR with low overpotentials of 141 mV, 220 mV, and 1.32 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm −2 in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, in situ/Operando Raman spectroscopy results reveal the importance of CoOOH active sites for enhanced electrochemical performance in Mo‐Co 3 O 4 ‐3 compared to the pure Co 3 O 4 . The urea electrolyzer with Mo‐Co 3 O 4 electrocatalysts acts as an anode and the cathode delivers 1.42 V at 10 mA cm −2 . A viable approach to creating effective UOR electrocatalysts involves synergistic engineering exploiting doping and oxygen vacancies.

Abstract The exploration of efficient, robust, and low‐cost bifunctional electrocatalysts to drive the commercial application of Zn‐air batteries (ZABs) is of great significance but still remains a challenge. Herein, a 1D coordination polymer (1D‐CP) derived FeNi alloy & Co nanoparticles (NPs) co‐implanted N‐doped carbon nanosheets (FNC/NCS) is judiciously crafted and employed as a high‐performance electrocatalyst for ultralong lifetime ZABs. The key to this strategy is the leveraging of metal‐coordinated melamine to direct the pyrolysis of 1D‐CP, enabling the in situ formation of well‐dispersed FeNi alloy and Co NPs within the carbon matrix. The resulting FNC/NCS exhibits prominent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a small overall oxygen potential difference (ΔE = 0.68 V). Density functional theory (DFT) simulation demonstrates that the synergistic effect between FeNi alloy and Co NPs can reduce energy barriers, promote electron transfer, and optimize the formation of crucial intermediates, thereby largely boost ORR/OER activity of FNC/NCS. The FNC/NCS‐assembled ZABs possess high specific capacity, large power density, and ultralong cycling life in both aqueous (> 3300 h) and solid‐state (150 h) electrolytes. This work provides a viable strategy for 1D‐CP‐derived bifunctional electrocatalysts and dissects the synergistic effect between different metal species, affording significant guidance for the development of renewable energy materials.

Abstract Developing cost‐effective, robust, and durable catalysts for water oxidation in acidic conditions remains a significant challenge for the practical application of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Cobalt‐based spinel catalysts, known for their effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in acidic environments, are promising alternatives to the costly iridium‐based catalysts. However, their application is often limited by poor stability under corrosive acidic conditions and oxidative potential. Here it is demonstrated that doping Co 2 MnO 4 with Ni effectively regulates the structural and electronic properties of the catalysts, enabling stable operation for over 285 h at 100 mA cm −2 in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 . This stability enhancement is primarily due to the increased exposure of the (400) facet, a result supported by theoretical studies. The proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) performance of Ni(5%)Co 2 MnO 4 further demonstrates its potential, achieving 1 A cm − 2 at a cell voltage of 2.3 V, with minimal degradation over 100 h at 500 mA cm − 2 . This study not only provides insights into the design of advanced OER catalysts through the doping of heteroatoms but also offers a pathway to enhance the sustainability and economic viability of acidic OER applications.

Abstract Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising pre‐catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their marvelous structural reconstruction process in strongly alkaline media. However, targeting design MOF structures to achieve excellent OER performance of reconstructed products is a challenge. Here, a strategic defect engineering is used to promote the OER performance of reconstructed products. Briefly, modified linkers with monocarboxylic acids (ferrocene carboxylic acid, FcCA) are incorporated into MOF (NiBDC‐FcCA), leading to its stepwise reconstruction into Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 and NiOOH during the OER process, with the oxygen vacancy and strategic doping of metal Fe persisting throughout the multi‐step reconstruction. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction of oxygen vacancies and Fe doping, NiBDC‐FcCA delivers the extremely enhanced current density at 1.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode by ≈9 times compared with that of NiBDC. Moreover, the optimized NiBDC‐FcCA/Fe foam exhibits excellent OER catalytic activity and stability with a low overpotential of 250 mV at 200 mA cm −2 and negligible activity decay after 1200 h at 1 A cm −2 . Density function theory calculations reveal that Fe doping weakens the interaction of oxygen intermediate with Ni sites, favoring the formation of OOH* to accelerate the OER process.

Aluminum‐air battery has the advantages of high energy density, low cost and environmental protection, and is considered as an ideal next‐generation energy storage conversion system. However, the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in air cathode leads to its unsatisfactory performance. Here, we report an electrode made of N and Ni co‐doped MnO2 nanotubes. In alkaline solution, Ni/N‐MnO2 has higher oxygen reduction activity than undoped MnO2, with an initial potential of 1.00 V and a half‐wave potential of 0.75 V. This is because it has abundant defects, high specific surface area and sufficient Mn3+ active sites, which promote the transfer of electrons and oxygen‐containing intermediates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that MnO2 doped with N and Ni atoms reduces the reaction overpotential and improves the ORR kinetics. The peak power density and energy density of the Ni/N‐MnO2 air electrode increased by 34.03 mW·cm‐2 and 316.41 mWh·g‐1, respectively. The results show that N and Ni co‐doped MnO2 nanotubes are a promising air electrode, which can provide some ideas for the research of aluminum‐air batteries.

Abstract The exploration of a new conceptual strategy for improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of earth‐abundant electrocatalysts is critical. In this study, chiral copper oxide nanoflower is explored by a self‐assembly method. The characterization suggests the chiral structure originates from the crystal plane‐level helical stack of the secondary nanosheets. Of note, the assembly illustrates a record‐high degree of spin polarization of 96%, indicating the ideal alignment of electron spin. Moreover, density function theory calculations show the chiral structure reducing the reaction energy barrier (REB) while switching the potential‐determining step from *O→*OOH to *OH→*O. Together with the enhanced electrochemical active surface area and accelerated charge transfer, the production of ground‐state triplet O 2 is improved via a spin‐forbidden route that involves the singlet H 2 O/OH•. Consequently, the chiral nanoflower shows a overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 93.5 mV dec −1 , which is even superior to the commercial RuO 2 (310 mV, 101 mV dec −1 ). This study presents a new strategy for improving the OER activity by simultaneously enhancing electronic properties and lowering the REB of an non‐noble electrocatalyst via chirality engineering.

Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) can be very effective for catalyzing both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we present theoretical evidence of a new class of highly active DACs, namely, the double-atom embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene sheet 2M-N-C (M = Mn, Fe) on the basis of density functional theory calculations. Importantly, we find that the double active sites of 2M-N-C DACs entail an unconventional catalytic reaction pathway for ORR and OER. We also show that the local coordination environment of the active sites can significantly affect the stability and oxygen catalytic activity of 2M-N-C DACs. In particular, MnFe-N-C DAC not only exhibits good stability but also possesses outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic activity with the potential difference (Δ

The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) endows NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe‐LDH) with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, yet the frequent evolution and sluggish regeneration of lattice oxygen intensify the dissolution of active species. Herein, we overcome this challenge by constructing the NiFe hydroxide/Ni4Mo alloy (NiFe‐LDH/Ni4Mo) heterojunction electrocatalyst, featuring the Ni4Mo alloy as the oxygen pump to provide oxygenous intermediates and electrons for NiFe‐LDH. The released lattice oxygen can be timely offset by the oxygenous species during the LOM process, balancing the regeneration of lattice oxygen and assuring the enhancement of the durability. In consequence, the durability of NiFe‐LDH is significantly enhanced after the modification of Ni4Mo with an impressively durability for over 60 h, much longer than that of NiFe‐LDH counterpart with only 10 h. In‐situ spectra and first‐principle simulations reveal that the adsorption of OH− is significantly strengthened owing to the introduction of Ni4Mo, ensuring the rapid regeneration of lattice oxygen. Moreover, NiFe‐LDH/Ni4Mo‐based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) presents an impressive durability for over 150 h at 100 mA cm−2. The oxygen pump strategy opens opportunities to balance the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, enhancing the durability of efficient OER catalysts.

Abstract Fe‐doped NiOOH electrocatalysts have attracted wide interest for the exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, but the precise role of Fe doping on the improved intrinsic activity remains unclear. Herein, the molecular probe technique combined with density functional theory calculation is used to reveal the influence of the Fe atom on the rate‐determining step of the OER reaction, where the pre‐catalyst of hierarchical self‐supporting NiFe layered double hydroxide [LDH] nanosheets equipped on nickel foam (NiFe LDH/NF) is generated via a facile and industrially well‐matched one‐pot corrosion method. The physical characterization results reveal the reconstruction of NiFe LDH into Fe‐doped NiOOH for promoted OER, which has a lower OH* adsorption energy with fast subsequent steps that help in obtaining an improved charge injection efficiency compared to NiOOH. In addition, more exposed electroactive species and facile delivery of mass/electron inside the catalytic procedure actually have a high‐quality contribution to the outstanding catalytic activity. Therefore, the NiFe LDH 36 /NF electrocatalyst provides high catalytic activities of 241 and 320 mV at 10 mA cm −2 toward the OER and overall water‐splitting in 1 m KOH. This work provides a promising avenue for the rational design of durable self‐supporting electrodes toward large‐scale water splitting.

Abstract Direct seawater electrolysis is emerging as a promising renewable energy technology for large‐scale hydrogen generation. The development of Os‐Ni 4 Mo/MoO 2 micropillar arrays with strong metal‐support interaction (MSI) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis is reported. The micropillar structure enhances electron and mass transfer, extending catalytic reaction steps and improving seawater electrolysis efficiency. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong MSI between Os and Ni 4 Mo/MoO 2 optimizes the surface electronic structure of the catalyst, reducing the reaction barrier and thereby improving catalytic activity. Importantly, for the first time, a dual Cl − repelling layer is constructed by electrostatic force to safeguard active sites against Cl − attack during seawater oxidation. This includes a strong Os─Cl adsorption and an in situ‐formed MoO 4 2− layer. As a result, the Os‐Ni 4 Mo/MoO 2 catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 113 and 336 mV to reach 500 mA cm −2 for HER and OER in natural seawater from the South China Sea (without purification, with 1 m KOH added). Notably, it demonstrates superior stability, degrading only 0.37 µV h −1 after 2500 h of seawater oxidation, significantly surpassing the technical target of 1.0 µV h −1 set by the United States Department of Energy.

Abstract The photoelectrochemical selective oxidation of biowaste glycerol into the high value‐added material, along with hydrogen production, holds significant promise for advancing renewable and sustainable energy technologies. Here, the surface oxygen state of tungsten oxide is modified to selectively oxidize glycerol into glyceraldehyde, a high‐value‐added material, and the selectivity is maintained over a prolonged period using the photo‐stimulated self‐recovery capability. The surface‐coordinated photoelectrode exhibits high charge transfer efficiency to glycerol and favorable glycerol adsorption capacity, enabling the selective conversion of glycerol. At 1.2 V RHE in a 2 m glycerol electrolyte adjusted to pH 2, the tungsten oxide photoelectrode achieves a photocurrent density of 2.58 mA cm −2 and a production rate of 378.8 mmol m −2 h −1 with selectivity of 86.1%. The high selectivity is preserved for 18 h by utilizing the self‐healing capability of tungsten oxide to restore initial states modified by photoelectrochemical oxidation. This work sheds light on the design of highly efficient metal oxide photoelectrodes for selective biomass oxidation over extended periods.

Reasonably screening the targeted oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constituents and constructing high‐efficiency and stabilized ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts are pivotal for the advancement of rechargeable zinc‐air batteries (ZABs). Here, CoFe layered double hydroxide (CoFe‐LDH) nanosheets are deposited on nitrogen‐doped graphite‐carbon polyhedra with FeCo alloy nanoparticles (FeCo/LDH‐NGCP). Due to the synergic effect between FeCo‐NGCP, CoFe‐LDH and FeCo/LDH‐NGCP, the electrocatalyst with the abundant and accessible active sites can provide good charge/mass transfer, and thus shows wonderful ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. In ORR tests, FeCo/LDH‐NGCP catalyst displays larger half‐wave potential (E1/2, 0.89 V vs. 0.85 V), higher limiting current density (JL, 5.91 mA/cm2 vs. 5.14 mA/cm2) and better stability than commercial Pt/C. As for OER, FeCo/LDH‐NGCP possesses a smaller overpotential (η) of 299.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and more durable stability than commercial RuO2 (330.6 mV). Furthermore, in ZAB tests, the cycling stability of ZAB‐FeCo/LDH‐NGCP (over 470 h) outperforms the ZAB‐Pt/C+RuO2 (92 h) with commercial electrocatalyst (Pt/C+RuO2). Therefore, the FeCo/LDH‐NGCP catalyst offers a new perspective to construct ZABs bifunctional catalysts and their commercial application in ZABs.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a significant bottleneck in many energy technologies such as electrochemical water splitting, metal‐oxygen (O) batteries, and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), because of the complexity of the reaction process. Double perovskite oxides (ABO3), recognized for their compositional flexibility, have emerged as excellent OER activity and stability. This study investigates the catalytic potential of B‐site ordered double ABO3 with (PrBa)xCo1.5Fe0.5O6‐δ (PBCF‐x, x=0.9‐1.1) in alkaline media. The results reveal that PBCF‐0.9, characterized by an A‐site deficient composition, exhibits exceptional OER activity. It demonstrates a low Tafel slope of 76.12 mV⋅dec‐1 and a low overpotential (η) of 270 mV at 10 mA⋅cm‐2. Notably, the intrinsic OER activity of PBCF‐0.9 is 25% higher than that of the stoichiometric PBCF‐1.0. Additionally, PBCF‐0.9 exhibits remarkable durability, as evidenced by its stable performance during a 6‐hour chronopotentiometry (CP) test and minimal microstructural changes. These results underscore the effectiveness of A‐site deficiency in optimizing the structure of double ABO3 for improved OER performance. This approach presents a promising strategy for designing highly efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts for energy‐related applications.

Abstract The demand for renewable energy sources has become more urgent due to climate change and environmental pollution. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in green energy sources. This article primarily explores the potential of using non‐noble metals, such as transition and rare earth metals, to enhance the efficiency of the OER process. Due to their cost‐effectiveness and unique electronic structure, these non‐noble metals could be a game‐changer in the field. ′Doping,′ which is the process of adding a small amount of impurity to a material to alter its properties, and ′synergistic effects,′ which refer to the combined effect of two or more elements that is greater than the sum of their individual effects, are two key concepts in this field. Transition and rare earth metals can reduce the overpotential, a measure of the excess potential required to drive a reaction, thus enhancing the OER process by engineering the electronic and surface molecular structure. This article summarizes the roles of various non‐noble metals in the OER process and highlights opportunities for researchers to propose innovative ways to optimize the OER process.

Bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components of rechargeable zinc‐air batteries. In this study, we synthesized a Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+δ (PBMCRO) perovskite composite with in situ exsolved CoRu nanoparticles and Co–N–C, functioning as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc‐air batteries. The in situ exsolution of CoRu nanoparticles from the perovskite oxide was facilitated by the reducing action of 2‐methylimidazole (2‐MIM). Concurrently, Co–N–C was used to decorate PBMCRO, forming a novel bifunctional composite electrode of Co–N–C–PBMCRO. The incorporation of CoRu nanoparticles introduces a significant number of electrochemically active oxygen vacancies in the perovskite matrix, enhancing ORR and OER performance. Additionally, the Co–N–C synergistically improves electrochemical activity while preserving the structural stability of the perovskite oxide.

FeNi‐based hybrid materials are promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for water electrolysis in hydrogen generation. In this work, the coordination tuning of FeNi‐HMT frameworks was achieved by simply changing the Fe/Ni ratios using hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as an organic ligand, and the derived hybrid FeNi catalysts with varied compositions were probed for OER. Incorporating varying amounts of Fe3+ by adjusting the Ni/Fe ratio results in different metal‐organic framework (MOF) structures, and higher Fe feed leads to the formation of amorphous structures due to the coordination structure destruction from the weaker coordination capacity of Fe3+ compared to Ni2+ combining with the tertiary amine ligand. Among them, the FeNi‐HMT (with the Fe/Ni molar ratio of 1/1) derived catalyst, consisting of Fe0.36Ni0.64 alloy/Ni0.4Fe2.6O4 spinel oxide heterostructures supported by graphitized carbon matrix, exhibits the highest OER performance. The unique structure facilitates significant electron transfer at the alloy/spinel interface due to the large work function difference between each phase. This strong electronic effect downshifts the d‐band center of the catalyst and optimizes the binding energies to the crucial oxygenated intermediates, thereby promoting the OER kinetics. This work highlights the importance of the coordination tuning of FeNi‐HMT frameworks for highly efficient catalyst development.

Abstract Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are excellent precursors for preparing transition metal and nitrogen co‐doped carbon catalysts, which have been widely utilized in the field of electrocatalysis since their initial development. However, the original MOFs derived catalysts have been greatly limited in their development and application due to their disadvantages such as metal atom aggregation, structural collapse, and narrow pore channels. Recently, surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts have attracted much attention from researchers due to their advantages such as hierarchical porous structure, increased specific surface area, and many exposed active sites. This review mainly focuses on the synthesis methods of surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts and comprehensively introduces the action of surfactants in MOFs derived materials and the structure‐activity relationship between the catalysts and the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Apparently, the aims of this review not only introduce the status of surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis but also contribute to the rational design and synthesis of MOFs derived catalysts for fuel cells, metal–air cells, and electrolysis of water toward hydrogen production.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reactions (OER) are critical to electrochemical synthesis reactions, including hydrogen production and organic hydrogenation. However, the high cost of existing OER catalysts (primarily Ir/Ru and its derived oxides) limits their practical application for electrochemical synthesis. To develop a low‐cost, high‐efficiency alternative, we need a deeper understanding of both the mechanisms that drive OER and the relationship between the catalyst's electronic structure and active sites. Here, we summarized recent developments of catalysts, especially focusing on the electronic structure modulation strategies and their subsequent activity enhancement. Most importantly, we pointed out the study directions for further work.

Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical‐aberration‐corrected microscope, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin‐polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70 mV at 150 mA cm‐2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin‐polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen‐involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.

An accurate understanding of the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for the design of efficient catalysts and the development of hydrogen energy. Despite significant advancements in microscopic pH detection studies through the use of mainstream strategies, such as scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE), and spectroscopic techniques, selective and sensitive detection of the change of proton (H+) concentration near the vicinity of the electrode during OER with high temporal resolution remains elusive. In this study, we pioneered the creation of an efficient hybrid electrochemiluminescence-based (ECL-based) pH sensor that enables the detection of H+ in the vicinity of the electrodes during OER. A new class of luminophore based on ECL resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) was theoretically predicted and further synthesized by grafting fluorescent dyes onto carbon nitride nanosheets (CN) through non-covalent interaction. We present that one of the newly synthesized emitters, CN-FITC, is capable of detecting proton with fast response time, where the ECL intensity of CN-FITC is regulated by proton concentration. By coating this emitter onto an electrode positioned near OER catalysts, proton generation near the vicinity of the catalysts could be qualitatively detected, providing details of the reaction mechanism of OER and unveiling the catalyst degrading pathway caused by proton accumulation. Additionally, the average proton generation rate on the catalyst was extracted from the local pH measurement, leading to a quantitative descriptor of the OER reaction rate. Owing to the high designability of the dye, this study opens up a new strategy for the detection of more reaction intermediates.

Abstract Research on the production and utilization of hydrogen energy is essential to overcome the environmental issues caused by fossil fuels. Herein, we anchor PtNi nanoalloy clusters (Pt‐Ni NACs) on nitrogen‐doped graphene oxide (NrGO) by a facile microwave‐assisted synthesis and analyze the variations of catalyst properties based on the PtNi composition and the presence of nitrogen. Ni inclusion in the Pt matrix can induce lattice strain and change the electronic structure, while the doped nitrogen into the graphene can enhance electron transfer and improve the durability of the catalyst through strong chemical bonding with the alloy clusters. TEM analysis discovers that the NACs are uniformly decorated in a few‐nanometer‐size on the graphene surface, and the formation of the PtNi NACs and structural changes according to composition are confirmed through XRD and XPS. In addition, the structural changes due to N‐doping and its bonding with the NACs are observed through Raman spectroscopy and XPS. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Pt 2.6 Ni NACs/NrGO exhibits the highest ORR onset potential (0.893 V) and the lowest HER overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 (22 mV) among other catalysts, and those activities are almost unchanged under long‐term durability tests. From these results, Pt 2.6 Ni NACs/NrGO is utilized in a zinc‐air battery (ZAB) system, demonstrating better battery performance than commercial Pt and Ir‐based catalysts. Moreover, it is applied to hydrogen collection, showing linear trend in hydrogen production over time, confirming the catalyst's availability in hydrogen production and utilization. image

Abstract Capitalizing on the electrochemical conversion of water into hydrogen stands as a pivotal strategy in the global transition toward sustainable energy sources. This study investigates the influence of the A‐site cation type within A 2 FeNbO 6 double perovskites (where A = Ca, Sr, or Ba) on their bifunctional electrocatalytic activities. The electrocatalytic performance is scrutinized in relation to charge transfer resistance, oxygen vacancy concentration, and metal‐oxygen covalency. Among the variants, Sr 2 FeNbO 6 is distinguished as the optimal catalyst, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm⁻ 2 at overpotentials of 260 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 176 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thus matching the performance of leading metal oxide electrocatalysts. The study reveals pH‐dependent kinetics for Sr 2 FeNbO 6 , indicative of a lattice oxygen evolution mechanism for OER. An electrolyzer employing Sr 2 FeNbO 6 electrodes for both the anode and cathode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm⁻ 2 at an efficient cell voltage of 1.76 V for complete alkaline water splitting, while also demonstrating exceptional stability. These insights advance the understanding of material optimization for electrocatalysis and position Sr 2 FeNbO 6 as a viable catalyst for the sustainable production of hydrogen.

Electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen is an efficient, clean, and environmentally friendly hydrogen production method with unlimited development prospects. However, its overall efficiency is hampered by the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with complex electron transfer processes. Therefore, designing efficient and low-cost OER catalysts is the key to solving this problem. In this paper, Ir-doped Co

The development of noble-metal free electrocatalysts with low production cost is of utmost importance for sustainable water electrolysis. Herein, we present a fast, flexible synthesis pathway for the preparation of a variety of different medium- and high-entropy spinel sulphides of various compositions, using a non-aqueous microwave-assisted synthesis without any H2S. Nanoparticulate high-entropy sulphides containing up to 8 different metal cations can be obtained after an extremely short synthesis time of only 1 min and comparatively low temperatures of 200-230 °C. We further demonstrate the high activity of the obtained sulphides for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

The solvothermal reactions involving cobalt ions with 5-methylisophthalic acid (H2MIP) and 1,3-bis(2-methylimidazol)propane (BMIP) yielded two cobalt(II) organic frameworks: {[Co4(MIP)4(BMIP)3]·1/2DMA}n (SNUT-31) and {[Co4(MIP)4(BMIP)3]·(EtOH)2·H2O]}n (SNUT-32) where DMA represents N,N-dimethylacetamide and EtOH signifies ethyl alcohol. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that SNUT-31 and SNUT-32 possess an isomorphic structure, featuring a unique 2-fold interpenetration of 3D frameworks in a parallel manner. Notably, both SNUT-31 and SNUT-32 demonstrate remarkable performance in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions and exhibit exceptional photocatalytic degradation capabilities against a model comprising three distinct dyes: rhodamine B, methyl orange, and methyl blue.

Abstract The development of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts is essential for hydrogen production from acidic water splitting. Herein, a TiO 2 nanotube‐loaded Co‐doped Ru nanoparticle catalyst (RuCo/TiO 2 NTs) is reported that exhibits excellent activity and stability toward acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Ru─O─Ti bonding is enhanced by Co doping, and the metal carrier interaction between Ru nanoparticles and TiO 2 NTs is enhanced, which effectively stabilizes Ru species during OER and initiates hydrogen spillover accelerating HER kinetics. As a result, RuCo/TiO 2 NTs catalyst requires only 156 mV OER overpotential and 17 mV HER overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 with a stability more than 500 h in acidic conditions. More importantly, benefiting from the excellent bifunctional activities, the proton exchange membrane electrolyte assembled from RuCo/TiO 2 NTs has excellent activity and robust stability (1000 h). This work opens a new avenue for the efficient energy conversion devices.

Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER); however, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major bottleneck due to its high energy requirements. High-performance electrocatalysts capable of facilitating HER, OER, and overall water splitting (OWS) are highly needed to improve OER kinetics. In this work, we synthesized a trimetallic heterostructure of Ru, Ni, and Co incorporated into N-doped carbon (denoted as Ru/Ni/Co@NC) by first synthesizing Ni/Co@NC from Ni-ZIF-67 polyhedrons via high-temperature carbonization, followed by Ru doping using the galvanic replacement method. Benefiting from increased active surface sites, modulated electronic structure, and enhanced interfacial synergistic effects, Ru/Ni/Co@NC exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic performance for both HER and OER processes. The optimized Ru/Ni/Co@NC catalyst, with a minimal Ru mass ratio of ∼2.07%, demonstrated significantly low overpotential values of 34 mV for HER and 174 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA/cm

Abstract The restacking and oxidizable nature of vanadium‐based carbon/nitride (V 2 C‐MXene) poses a significant challenge. Herein, tellurium (Te)‐doped V 2 C/V 2 O 3 electrocatalyst is constructed via mild H 2 O 2 oxidation and calcination treatments. Especially, this work rationally exploits the inherent easy oxidation characteristic associated with MXene to alter the interfacial information, thereby obtaining stable self‐generated vanadium‐based heterointerfaces. Meanwhile, the microetching effect of H 2 O 2 creates numerous pores to address the restacking issues. Besides, Te element doping settles the issue of awkward levels of absorption/desorption ability of intermediates. The electrocatalyst obtains an unparalleled hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with the overpotential of 83.5 and 279.8 mV at −10 and 10 mA cm −2 , respectively. In addition, the overall water‐splitting device demonstrates a low cell voltage of 1.41 V to obtain 10 mA cm −2 . Overall, the inherent drawbacks of MXene can be turned into benefits based on the planning strategy to create these electrocatalysts with desirable reaction kinetics.

Abstract The continuous quest of finding optimum catalysts for photo‐electrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting has been revolving around 2D ultrathin materials because of the fact of exploiting both the surface area. In this work, a threefold impact is envisaged route to enhance the activity both in terms of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the emerging Zirconium Tri‐sulfides (ZrS 3 ) based pseudo‐monolayers. Due to the unique and distinct electronic properties of the tri‐chalcogenide systems as compared to the di‐chalcogenide counterpart of Zirconium, one could afford to explore the implications of not only single‐atom functionalization and vacancy defect, but also the external strain to expedite the bifunctional catalytic activity in this promising material. Rigorous electronic structure calculations have been performed for the mentioned threefold effect on not only the band‐edge alignment, but going beyond to it by further constructing the reaction coordinate mapping corresponding to HER and OER mechanism. The repercussion of external strain in addition to the single atom functionalization and vacancy defect on the adsorption free energies of the prime intermediates of HER and OER reaction has been further correlated with the work function variation in this pseudo‐monolayer system.

Abstract Transition metal compounds (TMCs) are potentially fruitful substitutes for noble metals for electrocatalytic splitting of water due to their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, modifiable morphology, tunable electronic structure and their earth‐abundance. The combination of TMCs with graphene improves the dispersion of loaded catalysts, providing more catalytic active sites, enhancing the conductivity of hybrids, affording accelerated charge‐transfer kinetics, and minimizing catalyst bleaching, aggregation, and sintering under harsh reaction conditions. Additionally, graphene incorporation into TMCs modulates the electronic structure of active centers because of the synergistic interaction between them, thereby improving their catalytic performance. This review paper focuses on the recent progress made in designing different graphene‐transition metal‐based materials that can be used in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS). In‐situ characterization methodologies and DFT calculations that facilitate catalyst development are discussed elaborately. Finally, the advancements made in the development of graphene‐supported transition metal compounds for use in a functional water electrolyzer have been explored. In conclusion, a few specific recommendations have been made about the current challenges related to the widespread production of effective HER/OER electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have drawn widespread attention as promising electrocatalysts due to their special electronic structure, good electrochemical activity, low cost, and high abundance. Although a great deal of effort has been expended in the pursuit of TMPs, the majority of synthesis processes are complex and hazardous due to the use of flammable and toxic phosphorus sources. Herein, we propose a nontoxic and scalable synthetic strategy for the synthesis of NiCoP@NC by using green and cheap diethylenetriaminepentakis (methylphosphonic acid) (DTPMP) as the phosphorus source. DTPMP can also act as a chelating agent and displays strong coordination ability with metal ions, thereby reducing particle size and forming nanoparticles. The NiCoP@NC exhibits outstanding stability and electrocatalytic activity in both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, water electrolysis performance also is measured using NiCoP@NC as both anode and cathode, which delivers a cell voltage of 1.73 V at 10 mA·cm–2 and can operate stably for 24 h. This work not only constructs efficient bifunctional catalysts, but also broadens the green synthesis method of nanosized TMPs, paving the way for further large-scale practical applications.

Abstract Sustainable electrochemical energy generation requires cost-effective, noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen production in electrolyzers. This study used electrodeposition to create crystalline NiB films with different boron (B) contents—Ni-B(1.17 wt.%), Ni-B(1.06 wt.%), Ni-B(0.94 wt.%), and Ni-B(0.89 wt.%)—on FTO substrates. These films were tested as bifunctional electrocatalyst electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The NiB films' composition and morphology were analyzed using SEM, AFM, XRD, GD-OES, and XPS. Linear sweep voltammetry assessed their electrocatalytic performance. Higher B content in the films promoted the formation of electroactive NiOOH, enhancing the OER. The Ni-B(1.17 wt.%) electrode required an overpotential of 380 mV to reach 10 mA cm⁻² for OER, while the Ni-B(1.06 wt.%) electrode required 146 mV for the same current density for HER. An alkaline water electrolyzer using Ni-B(1.17 wt.%) as the anode and Ni-B(1.06 wt.%) as the cathode achieved a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² at 1.71 V for overall water splitting. The system showed stability over 12 hours of testing. The results indicate that NiB films on FTO substrates are promising, low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis, offering an alternative to noble-metal-based electrocatalysts.

Abstract Seawater, being the most plentiful natural water source worldwide, is a highly abundant and cost‐efficient medium for producing hydrogen by alkaline water electrolysis. However, the advancement of seawater electrolysis is hindered by notable impediments caused by chloride corrosion at the anode and the simultaneous chlorine evolution process. Only a limited number of non‐noble electrocatalysts demonstrate noteworthy bifunctional catalytic efficacy and long‐term durability. In this regard, Nickel Nitride tailored V 2 CT X Mxene nanostructures is reported as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water/seawater applications. The optimized sample Ni 3 N@3000‐V 2 CT x exhibits low overpotential values of 90 and 300 mV in acidic and alkaline + seawater solutions respectively at 10 mA cm −2 for hydrogen evolution reaction. Similarly, this catalyst shows 70 and 240 mV overpotential values in alkaline water and alkaline + seawater solutions respectively at the same current density for oxygen evolution reaction. Synergetic effects of Multiple Vanadium and Nickel valency along with compelling nitrogen bonds creates elevated density of exposed functional sites for electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the notable electrochemical active surface area and mass activity suggest an enhanced and significant presence of abundant active sites. Additionally, the high stability and significantly decreased charge transfer resistance expedited the overall water/seawater‐splitting reaction rate.

The production of hydrogen (H 2 ) and multi-carbon fuels through water electrolysis (oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) and water–CO 2 co-electrolysis (OER/CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR)), respectively, is supposed to be the emergent energy carrier. These electrochemical processes are essential chemical conversion pathways that initiate the changes toward production of renewable energy. This review summarizes the systematic design of earth-abundant transition metal-based nanomaterials and their electrocatalytic activities toward electrochemical energy conversion reactions such as OER, HER, and CO 2 RR. The primary focus is on fabricating highly effective, low-cost, and advanced transition metal-based nanostructures for both the OER/HER and OER/CO 2 RR systems. Developing synthetic strategies for surface morphology-controlled nanostructured electrocatalysts, engineering the electrode surface, enhancing the electrocatalytic activity, understanding the relationship between intrinsic catalytic activity and preparation approaches or precursor choices, and exploring the reaction mechanism are focused on. Furthermore, the current challenges, figure-of-merit, and prospects of transition metal-based nanomaterials and their electrocatalytic activities toward water electrolysis and water–CO 2 co-electrolysis are described. This study may open new opportunities to develop shape-controlled and high-performance electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion and storage reactions.

Abstract Investigating advanced electrocatalysts is crucial for improving the efficacy of water splitting to generate environmentally friendly fuel. The discovery of highly effective electrocatalysts, capable of driving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea‐alkaline environments, is pivotal for advancing large‐scale hydrogen production. This study aims to introduce a new method that involves creating nanosheets of high‐loading iridium single atoms embedded in a manganese‐containing nickel oxyhydroxide matrix (Ir@Mn─NiOOH). These nanostructures are derived from self‐supported hydrate pre‐catalyst nanosheets grown on nickel foam and then activated through electrochemical etching pretreatment. The Ir@Mn─NiOOH nanoarchitecture displays outstanding electrocatalytic activity, having a low overpotential of just 258 mV and a potential of 1.319 V (at 10 mA cm −2 ) for OER and UOR, respectively. Such extraordinary catalytic characteristics of Ir@Mn─NiOOH is mainly owing to the strong synthetic electronic interaction between Ir single atoms and Mn─NiOOH, which can change its electronic characteristics and boost electrochemical catalytic sites. This research presents a new way to produce exceptionally efficient catalysts by adding a synergistic effect to complex multi‐electron processes.

In the search of sustainable energy solutions, proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) have emerged as a promising alternative for sustainable clean hydrogen production. This study focuses on synthesis and characterization of Ruthenium (Ru)-modified iridium oxide (IrO2) catalysts. The anode is the principal reason for the high overpotential of PEMWEs and it also greatly increases the cost of the electrolyzers. IrO2 is highly stable and corrosion-resistant, particularly in acidic environments, making it a durable catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEMWEs, though it suffers from a relatively high overpotential. Ruthenium oxide (RuO2), on the other hand, is more catalytically active with a lower overpotential, but is less stable under the same conditions. In this study, the goal was to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the anode catalyst, IrO2, through the controlled incorporation of Ru and to reduce overall catalyst cost due to the reduced iridium content. This synergistic combination allows for better performance in terms of conductivity, efficiency, and durability, making Ru-modified IrO2 an ideal catalyst for OER in PEMWE applications. The Adams fusion method was adapted and used to synthesize the catalysts. The modified catalysts were characterized using analytical instruments. These analyses provided insights into the structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of the Ru-modified IrO2 catalysts.

ABSTRACT Water splitting, a critical milestone in the development of renewable energy, allows the production of pure hydrogen and oxygen. Iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ), a fundamental component in electrochemical water splitting for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), offers potential because of its accessibility, low cost, and environmental safety. Herein, to analyze the impact of the methodology on its properties, Fe 2 O 3 was produced in three different ways: freeze‐drying (aerogel) (Fe 2 O 3 ‐AG), hydrothermal (Fe 2 O 3 ‐HT), and microwave (Fe 2 O 3 ‐MW). The Fe 2 O 3 ‐AG outperformed Fe 2 O 3 ‐HT and Fe 2 O 3 ‐MW in most properties which showed improved current and overall water‐splitting efficiency. The resulting materials demonstrated good electrocatalytic performance for both HER and OER in alkaline media, with overpotentials for HER of 204, 235, and 255 mV and overpotentials for OER of 222, 288, and 292 mV for the Fe 2 O 3 ‐AG, Fe 2 O 3 ‐HT, and Fe 2 O 3 ‐MW samples, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm 2 . The freeze‐drying synthesis process has significant potential as a feasible method for the manufacture of Fe 2 O 3 ‐based electrocatalysts for water‐splitting applications. This study provides important insights into the influence of electrocatalytic and energy storage properties of Fe 2 O 3 based on the use of different methodologies, that is, hydrothermal, microwave‐assisted, and freeze‐drying. Through that, a more assertive analysis can be made concerning changes in morphology, conductivity, exposure of active area, and electrochemical stability which are crucial for the overall performance, hence providing valuable information and considerations for possible large‐scale applications for energy generation and energy storage.

The prepared materials were synthesized hydrothermally and characterized using X‐ray diffraction (XRD), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine their structural properties, elemental composition, and morphological features. Notably, the F@C−B nanocomposite exhibited outstanding HER performance, requiring only 97 mV of overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Similarly, the F@C−C nanocomposite demonstrated impressive OER efficiency with an overpotential of merely 302 mV at the same current density. The involvement of the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism was confirmed through Tafel slope analysis, revealing the improved surface‐active sites and reduced charge transfer resistance of the nanocomposite. The FeS 2 @CoSe 2 nanocomposite with synergistic effects, displayed exceptional electrocatalytic properties, positioning it as a promising candidate for overall water splitting. This work introduces a novel approach to developing highly efficient and cost‐effective electrocatalysts, offering a viable alternative to precious metal‐based counterparts.

Maintaining an acceptable quality of life worldwide increasingly depends on the availability of clean and cost-effective energy, with power consumption expected to double by 2050. Therefore, the need for sustainable and affordable green energy has spurred innovative electrocatalysis research with the goal to develop materials and processes that are capable of producing environmentally friendly, carbon-neutral, clean, and green hydrogen fuel as an alternative to fossil fuel. In particular, heterostructured catalysts consisting of transition metal oxides and sulfides have emerged as a capable component of green energy technology. The dual functionality of these catalysts allows for water splitting, while the selectivity of the catalytic materials creates synergetic effects based on their electronic structure, surface composition, and electrochemical surface area. In this review, we examine the latest research and developments, synthesis methods, design strategies, reaction mechanisms, and performance outcomes for oxide/sulfide heterostructures. The review begins by introducing the current demand for hydrogen energy and electrocatalytic water-splitting and then describes the fundamental design principles for oxide/sulfide heterostructures and their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. A large part of the review is then dedicated to a comprehensive discussion of the various transition metal oxide/sulfide heterostructures designed for the OER, the HER, and two-electrode electrolyzer applications. In addition, the use of in situ and operando techniques, which provide crucial information for the design of effective electrocatalysts, is described. We also discuss the present status of electrocatalysis technology, including the challenges it faces and its future prospects as a means to achieve carbon-neutral hydrogen production. Overall, this review delivers a summary of the latest developments in electrocatalysis based on oxide/sulfide heterostructures for use in green hydrogen production.

Abstract Aqueous lithium‐ion batteries (ALIBs) have attracted significant interest due to their inherent advantage on safety. However, water itself has a narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW), limiting the energy density of ALIBs. Here, a low‐molecular‐weight zwitterionic oligomer, oligo(propylsulfonate dimethylammonium propylmethacrylamide) (OPDP), as an effective water binding agent for high‐voltage ALIBs is demonstrated. The OPDP can effectively confine water molecules while reducing water activity. The OPDP‐based electrolyte, with an ultra‐high water weight percentage of 25.4%, possesses an outstanding ESW of up to 3.26 V and an ionic conductivity as high as 3.18 mS cm −1 . Furthermore, the aqueous Mo 6 S 8 //LiMn 2 O 4 full cell with OPDP‐based electrolyte achieves a 99.7% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5C with a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.7% and a specific energy of 88–101 Wh kg −1 . Also, it achieves an 89% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 10C with a high CE of 99.9%. These postmortem characterizations suggest that robust organic–inorganic hybrid cathode/anode‐electrolyte interfaces have been constructed during the cycling through the heteroatoms of N, S, and O in the zwitterionic oligomer, leading to the inhibited hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and high performance of the full cell. This work provides a promising strategy for developing low‐cost and high‐voltage aqueous batteries.

Abstract Nanostructured multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have been explored as next-generation engineering materials due to unique mechanical and functional properties which have significant advantages over traditional dilute alloys. However, the practical applications of nanostructured MPEAs are still limited due to the lack of scalable processing approaches to prepare a large quantity of nanostructured MPEAs, as well as lack of an efficient pathway for high-throughput discovery of better functional nanostructured MPEAs within their vast compositional space. Here we tackle these challenges by presenting an integrated approach by combining direct-ink-writing-based additive manufacturing, solid-state sintering, and chemical dealloying to manufacture hierarchically porous MPEAs. The hierarchical structure is comprised of macro- and micro-scale pores introduced via extrusion printing and polymer decomposition during sintering, as well as nanoscale pores formed via chemical dealloying. The macro- and micro-scale pores allow efficient dealloying of a large mass of material as the diffusion length that the corroding medium must penetrate remains at the scale of the ligaments formed after sintering (~10 μm), despite the large volume of the 3D-printed samples. In addition, this integrated approach enables versatile control of the alloy composition via precisely tuning the ratio of elemental powders in the starting ink, thus offering a pathway for high-throughput discovery of novel functional MPEAs. As a case study, multiscale macro/micro/nanoporous NiFeMn MPEAs with three different compositions were investigated as catalysts to reduce the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where NiFeMn-based electrocatalysts display composition-dependent performance such that the overpotential measured at a current of 0.5 A/g for OER increases in the order of Ni58Fe29Mn13 ≤ Ni64Fe26Mn10 < Ni76Fe18Mn6. This introduced manufacturing process offers new opportunities for scalable fabrication and rapid screening of nanostructured multi-component complex alloys. &#xD;

Abstract Both commercially available and laboratory-synthesized IrO2 catalysts typically possess rutile-type structures and diverse facet orientations. According to the theoretical results from density functional theory calculations, distinct IrO2 facets will result in divergent electrocatalytic properties, among which the (101) crystal facet is theoretically predicted as the most energetically favorable for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to its lowest energy barrier. Maintaining a single-unit-cell thickness while exposing a desired facet of 2D IrO2 presents a significant opportunity and challenge for the development of high-performance OER anode catalysts. Herein, we develop an ammonia-induced facet engineering for oriented modulation of crystal facets in the ultimate limit of monolayer thickness, and successfully synthesize 2D monolayer IrO2 exposing unique (101) facet. At the current density of 10 mA cm-2geo, an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV has been achieved on the highly activated (101) facet in a three-electrode system. More importantly, in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, the IrO2 anode reaches a low voltage of 1.74 V at an industrial-level current density of 2 A cm-2geo, much lower than that of all commercial IrO2 electrocatalysts. Though facet engineering primarily contributes to modulating the intrinsic activity rather than stability, the as-prepared IrO2(101) monolayer performs over 8,000 hours of PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) stability at constant 1.5 A cm-2geo, with a negligible decay rate of 4.0 mV kh-1. Furthermore, even a long-term PEMWE test of 1000 h using the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with ultra-low Ir loading of 0.2 mgIr cm-2geo under fluctuating operating conditions is performed, ECell remains highly electrochemically stable over time at 1.5 A cm-2geo, without any signs of catalyst degradation. This work proposes that ammonia-induced facet engineering of 2D monolayer IrO2 could represent a novel approach to selectively expose the desired (101) facet, thereby enabling unique facet-dependent OER performance and ultrahigh stability in industrial-scale PEM electrolysis, even under voltage fluctuations generated by solar and wind power.

Two-dimensional (2D) borophene materials are predicted to be ideal catalytic materials due to their structural analogy to graphene. However, the lack of chemical functionalization of borophene hinders its practical application in catalysis. Herein, we reported a massive production of freestanding few-layer 2D borophene oxide (BO) sheets with tunable active oxygen species by a moderate oxidation-assisted exfoliation method. State-of-the-art characterizations demonstrated the evolution of active oxygen species from surface B-O species at the initial stage to the intermediate B

Abstract We study the properties of double white dwarf (DWD) mergers by performing hydrodynamic simulations using the new and improved adaptive mesh refinement code Octo-Tiger. We follow the orbital evolution of DWD systems of mass ratio q = 0.7 for tens of orbits until and after the merger to investigate them as a possible origin for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) type stars. We reproduce previous results, finding that during the merger, the helium WD donor star is tidally disrupted within 20-80 minutes since the beginning of the simulation onto the accretor carbon-oxygen WD, creating a high temperature shell around the accretor. We investigate the possible helium burning in this shell and the merged object’s general structure. Specifically, we are interested in the amount of oxygen-16 dredged-up from the accretor to the hot shell and the amount of oxygen-18 produced. This is critical as the discovery of very low oxygen-16 to oxygen-18 ratios in RCB stars pointed out the merger scenario as a favorable explanation for their origin. A small amount of hydrogen in the donor may help keep the oxygen-16 to oxygen-18 ratios within observational bounds, even if moderate dredge-up from the accretor occurs. In addition, we perform a resolution study to reconcile the difference found in the amount of oxygen-16 dredge-up between smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and grid-based simulations.

Molecular oxygen redox electrocatalysis involves oxygen reduction and evolution as core reactions in various energy conversion and environmental technology fields. Strong metal-support interactions (SMSIs) based nanomaterials are regarded as desirable and state-of-the-art heterogeneous electrocatalysts due to their exceptional physicochemical properties. Over the past decades, considerable advancements in theory and experiment have been achieved in related studies, especially in modulating the electronic structure and geometrical configuration of SMSIs to enable activity, selectivity, and stability. In this focuses on the concept of SMSI, explore their various manifestations and mechanisms of action, and summarizes recent advances in SMSIs for efficient energy conversion in oxygen redox electrocatalysis applications. Additionally, the correlation between the physicochemical properties of different metals and supports is systematically elucidated, and the potential mechanisms of the structure-activity relationships between SMSIs and catalytic performance are outlined through theoretical models. Finally, the obstacles confronting this burgeoning field are comprehensively concluded, targeted recommendations and coping strategies are proposed, and future research perspectives are outlined.

We study the energy dependence of the total and diffractive neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus cross sections at very high energies. The calculation employs the QCD dipole model and the small-$x$ nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. We show the sensitivity of the nuclear effect quantification on the nuclear setup, and predict up to $\sim 10\%$ nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-oxygen scattering stemming from the nonlinear evolution. Diffractive contribution to the total scattering is small, which is only few percentage. The $\left|q\bar{q}g\right>$ componnent of the $W^{\pm}$ boson is found to contribute significantly to the diffractive process, which reaches up to $\sim 40\%$ of the diffractive cross section.

Abstract Blood is a miracle fluid. It uses the protein hemoglobin to carry oxygen to all cells. It also carries nutrients to tissues and carries away carbon dioxide and waste products. It transports signaling molecules, hormones, and other important molecules. Finally, it has an intricate system that initiates clotting to stop bleeding. Three organs are intimately linked with the blood. The heart pumps blood to the lungs, where the blood gas exchange occurs, and the kidneys remove waste products and help to maintain blood pressure. The evolution of blood and the heart is also fascinating.

Carbon nanoparticle interactions with gases are central to many environmental and technical processes, but the underlying reaction kinetics and mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigate the oxidation and gasification of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions. We build on a comprehensive experimental data set and use a kinetic multilayer model (KM‐GAP‐CARBON) to trace the uptake and release of gas molecules alongside the temporal evolution of particle size and surface composition. The experimental results are captured by a model mechanism that involves different types of carbon atoms (edge/plane‐like) and the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate (activated CO complex) as the rate‐limiting step. A transition between distinct chemical regimes driven by NO2 at lower temperatures and O2 at higher temperatures is reflected by an increase in the observable activation energy from ~60 kJ/mol to ~130 kJ/mol. We derive energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways that involve uni‐ or bimolecular decomposition of reactive oxygen intermediates.

Thyroid hormones play an important morphogenetic role during the fetal and neonatal periods and regulate numerous metabolic processes. In the central nervous system, they control myelination and overall brain development, regional gene expression, and regulation of oxygen consumption. Their deficiency in the fetal and neonatal periods causes severe mental retardation, due to lack of thyroid function, or to iodine deficiency. At the same time, nitric oxide is an atypical neurotransmitter that also has special relevance in neuronal development and plasticity and functions as a vasodilator, regulating cerebral blood flow. Although under physiological conditions it functions as a neuroprotector, in excess it can be neurotoxic. We have studied, by immunocytochemical and Western blot techniques, the evolution of the expression of neuronal and inducible isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, and of nitrotyrosine as a marker of protein nitration produced by the presence of nitric oxide, during the early stages of postnatal brain development. We induced hypothyroidism by administering mercaptomethylimidazole to pregnant mothers, from the seventh day of gestation until the sacrifice of the offspring. The results show a delay in the evolution of the expression of the two isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase in hypothyroid animals, followed by an anomalous overexpression in later stages. Finally, the expression of nitrotyrosine follows an evolution that is synchronized with that shown by both isoenzymes in control and hypothyroid animals.

ABSTRACT The tectonic evolution of the Palaeocene–Eocene Tethys Himalayan foreland basin plays a crucial role in reshaping the collisional orogenic process of the Yarlung–Tsangpo oceanic basin. However, studies examining the sedimentary response during the tectonic evolution of the foreland basin are lacking. In this study, through a detailed field investigation and analysis of Palaeocene–Eocene strata in the Tingri area, we clarified the evolution of the Tethys Himalayan tectonic regions and its sedimentary response. Carbon and oxygen isotopes, geochemistry and detrital zircon U–Pb dating demonstrated that the lower Palaeocene Jidula Formation and upper Palaeocene–lower Eocene Zongpu Formation were deposited in a coastal–shallow marine environment, with the detritus sourced from the northern Indian passive margin. The upper Eocene Pengqu Formation was deposited in a deltaic environment, with its detritus sourced from the Gangdese arc and the Yarlung–Tsangpo suture zone at the active continental margin. Combined with the nearshore subaqueous fan branch channel of the Jidula Formation and the slump deformation of the Zongpu Formation, the Palaeocene–Early Eocene southern Tethys Himalaya in the Tingri area was located in the forebulge of the peripheral foreland basin. The marine–continental interactive delta of the Pengqu Formation and its provenance from the Gangdese magmatic arc indicate that the Tingri area was situated in the foredeep of the peripheral foreland basin during the Late Eocene. The study provides valuable insights into the collisional orogenic processes between the Indian and Eurasian plates.

The ingenuity to precisely control and tune the inherent properties by reconstructing their crystal structure is particularly advantageous in electrocatalysis reactions like oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Incorporating multidimensional imperfections in the presumably perfect crystal structure of the perovskite catalysts is garnering booming attention among researchers. This concept can expertly influence the electronic structure and boost the reaction kinetics during electrocatalysis. Defects or imperfections are achieved by substituting A‐ and/or B‐sites with heteroatoms or by oxygen vacancies. Defect engineering points to a promising new direction in the development of perovskite oxide catalysts. This work surveys the recent progress in defect engineering and how it plays a vital role in their design, and application in electrocatalysis, mainly ORR/OER. The architecture, dimensionality, and the types of perovskite oxides based on their cations, crystal structures, and stoichiometries are surveyed for a comprehensive understanding. This review aims to provide an extensive outlook on oxide perovskite catalysts concerning structural defects.

Abstract We investigate the evolution of magnetic fields generated by the crystallization-driven dynamo in carbon–oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) with masses ≲1.05 M ⊙ . We use scalings for the dynamo to demonstrate that the initial magnetic field strength ( B 0 ) has an upper limit that depends on the initial convection zone size ( R out,0 ) and the WD mass. We solve the induction equation to follow the magnetic field evolution after the dynamo phase ends. We show that the predicted surface magnetic field strength ( B surf ) differs from B 0 by at least a factor of ∼0.3. This reduction depends on R out,0 , where values smaller than half of the star radius give B surf ≲ 0.01 B 0 . We implement electrical conductivities that account for the solid phase effect on the ohmic diffusion. We observe that the conductivity increases as the solid core grows, freezing in the magnetic field at a certain point of the evolution and slowing its outward transport. We study the effect of turbulent magnetic diffusivity induced by the convection and find that for a small R out,0 , B surf is stronger than the nonturbulent diffusion cases because of the more rapid transport, but still orders of magnitude smaller than B 0 . Given these limitations, the crystallization-driven dynamo theory could explain only magnetic C/O WDs with field strengths less than a few megagauss for the mass range 0.45–1.05 M ⊙ . Our results also suggest that a buried fossil field must be at least 100 times stronger than observed surface fields if crystallization-driven convection is responsible for its transport to the surface.

Circumstellar material (CSM) produced by mass loss from massive stars ($\gtrsim10 M_{\odot}$) through strong stellar winds or binary stripping provides rich information for understanding progenitors of core-collapse supernova remnants. In this paper we present a grating spectroscopy of a Galactic SNR G292.0+1.8, which is claimed to be a Type Ib/c remnant in a binary system according to recent studies. If G292.0+1.8 was experienced a strong mass-loss via binary interactions before its explosion, an oxygen-rich material produced in the He-burning layer is expected to be observed in the central belt-like structure formed by shock-heated CSM. Using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard XMM-Newton, we detect N VII Ly$\alpha$ line (0.50 keV) for the first time in G292.0+1.8 and find that the abundance ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is significantly lower (N/O$=0.5\pm0.1$) than the solar value. This low N/O suggests that the progenitor of experienced strong mass-loss and ended up to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star exposing the He-burning layer at the pre-supernova. Comparing our result and the evolution models of single stars and binaries, we conclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong mass-loss enough to occur a Type Ib/c supernova. Our finding is another crucial piece of evidence for a stripped-envelope supernova such as Type Ib/c as the origin of G292.0+1.8.    

    

## Evolution of gas envelopes and outgassed atmospheres of rocky planets

We present here results of numerical simulations of the formation and early evolution of rocky planets through pebble accretion, with an with an emphasis on hydrogen envelope longevity and the composition of the outgassed atmosphere. We model planets with a range in mass from 0.1 to 5 Earth masses that orbit between 0.7 and 1.7 AU. The composition of the outgassed atmosphere is calculated with the partial pressure of free oxygen fit to geophysical models of magma ocean self-oxidation. XUV radiation powered photoevaporation is considered as the main driver of atmospheric escape. We model planets that remain below the pebble isolation mass and hence accrete tenuous envelopes only. We consider slow, medium or fast initial stellar rotation for the temporal evolution of the XUV flux. The loss of the envelope is a key event that allows the magma ocean to crystallise and outgas its bulk volatiles. The atmospheric composition of the majority of our simulated planets is dominated by CO$_2$. Our planets accrete a total of 11.6 Earth oceans of water, the majority of which enters the core. The hydrospheres of planets lighter than the Earth reach several times the mass of the Earth's modern oceans, while the hydrospheres of planets ranging from 1 to 3.5 Earth masses are comparable to those of our planet. However, planets of 4-5 Earth masses have smaller hydrospheres due to trapping of volatiles in their massive mantles. Overall, our simulations demonstrate that hydrogen envelopes are easily lost from rocky planets and that this envelope loss triggers the most primordial partitioning of volatiles between the solid mantle and the atmosphere.

We calculate the energy dependence of inclusive and diffractive neutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering cross sections within the dipole picture, focusing on the ultra-high-energy regime. We predict an up to $\sim 10\%$ nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-Oxygen scattering originating from the non-linear QCD dynamics in the small-$x$ Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. Diffraction is found to be a small $1\dots 4\%$ contribution to the total cross section across a wide range of neutrino energies relevant for current and near-future experiments. The diffractive cross section is calculated separately for the coherent and incoherent channels that are found to be of equal importance. Additionally, we include the dominant contribution from the $|q\bar q g\rangle$ Fock state of the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons in the high-$Q^2$ limit, along with the lowest-order $|q\bar q\rangle$ contribution. The $|q\bar{q}g\rangle$ contribution is found to be numerically significant, reaching up to 40\% of the diffractive cross section.

Comprehensive Summary Amidst the pressing environmental challenges posed by the prevalent reliance on fossil fuels, it becomes imperative to seek sustainable alternatives and prioritize energy efficiency. Electrocatalysis, which is renowned for its high efficiency and environmental friendliness, has garnered significant attention. Rare earth elements (REEs), distinguished by their unique electronic and orbital structures, play a crucial role in electrocatalysis. The strategic integration of REEs into catalysts allows for the fine‐tuning of atomic structures, which in turn, significantly boosts catalytic performance. Despite substantial advancements in rare earth‐based materials for electrocatalysis, a comprehensive overview of the regulatory mechanisms involving REEs is lacking. In this mini‐review, we systematically explore the regulatory mechanisms of REEs within electrocatalysts and their pivotal roles in essential electrocatalytic processes such as the CO 2 reduction reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. We commence with an elucidation of REEs, proceed to delineate their regulatory impacts on electrocatalysts and delve into their applications in key electroreduction reactions. We conclude with discussions on current limitations and prospects for further advancements in this burgeoning field of research. Key Scientists

Particulate matter (PM) undergoing various aging processes in the atmosphere changes its toxicity. However, the mechanism of toxicity evolution is not fully clarified currently. This study demonstrates that photoaging promotes an increase in the oxidative potential (OP) of atmospheric PM by about 30%, and the increased OP is mainly attributed to the production of secondary organic compounds, while water-soluble metal ions contribute only 11%. The OP of nonextractable matters (NEMs) of atmospheric PM was mostly increased after photoaging, followed by water-soluble matters (WSMs). NEM can produce quinone-like functional groups and secondary persistent free radicals during photoaging, which are most likely to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). For WSM, the conversion of low-oxidation humic-like substances (HULIS) to high-oxidation HULIS is the main reason for the increase in OP. Quinones, nitrophenols, and N-containing heterocycles are the OP contributors produced during the conversion process. Among them, quinones are the main secondary oxidizing active compounds, while nitro-phenolic compounds and N-containing heterocyclic compounds may play a catalyst-like role, facilitating the production of oxidizing active compounds and ROS in the newly converted high-oxidation HULIS. This study clarifies the secondary OP generation mechanism and provides new insights into the uncertainty of PM toxicity during atmospheric aging.

We report the first successful ALMA follow-up observations of a secure $z > 10$ JWST-selected galaxy, by robustly detecting ($6.6\sigma$) the [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$ line in JADES-GS-z14-0 (hereafter GS-z14). The ALMA detection yields a spectroscopic redshift of $z=14.1793\pm0.0007$, and increases the precision on the prior redshift measurement of $z=14.32_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ from NIRSpec by $\gtrsim$180$\times$. Moreover, the redshift is consistent with that previously determined from a tentative detection ($3.6\sigma$) of CIII]$_{1907,1909}$ ($z=14.178\pm0.013$), solidifying the redshift determination via multiple line detections. We measure a line luminosity of $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88} = (2.1 \pm 0.5)\times10^8\,L_\odot$, placing GS-z14 at the lower end, but within the scatter of, the local $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88}$-star formation rate relation. No dust continuum from GS-z14 is detected, suggesting an upper limit on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of $< 2 \times 10^{-3}$, consistent with dust production from supernovae with a yield $y_d < 0.3\,M_\odot$. Combining a previous JWST/MIRI photometric measurement of the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007$\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ and H$\beta$ lines with Cloudy models, we find GS-z14 to be surprisingly metal-enriched ($Z\sim0.05 - 0.2\,Z_\odot$) a mere $300\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Big Bang. The detection of a bright oxygen line in GS-z14 thus reinforces the notion that galaxies in the early Universe undergo rapid evolution.

Abstract Microbubbles flow electrolytic plasma polishing (MF-EPP) facilitates controllable electrolytic plasma polishing (EPP) using a low-power supply. It is well established that a vapor gaseous envelope (VGE) around a workpiece is essential for EPP polishing. Nonetheless, the generation condition and its control parameter of a local gas film on the workpiece surface in MF-EPP is not fully understood. In this study, an analysis by the electrochemical and hydrothermal reactions revealed that the gas composition on the anode surface is mainly composed of water vapor, which is heated by Joule heat, and electrolysis gases such as oxygen, fluorine, hydrogen, and nitrogen. By analyzing formation conditions and calculating the volume flux of each gas, it was found that vapor is the main component of the gas film. For the vapor characteristics, the bubble nucleation and growth model has been established. On this basis, the main factors affecting the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of bubbles were then analyzed, indicating that superheating and heat flow density are the principal factors affecting the aggregation of bubbles and thus the formation of a gas film. It was determined that the presence of electrolytic gases exerts a beneficial influence on the nucleation of vapor bubbles. Additionally, a bubble dynamics model was constructed based on the conservation of energy, and the impact of processing parameters on the evolution of bubbles was analyzed. The threshold for the formation of a stable gas film under the conditions of this experiment was determined to be a voltage of 350 V and an initial electrolyte temperature of 80°C. The applicability of the model was validated through experimentation, and the establishment of the model provides theoretical and experimental references for the formulation and optimization of MF-EPP machining process parameters.

Abstract Harsh synthetic conditions for crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) and associated limitations on structural diversities impede not only further development of functional CTFs, but also practical large‐scale synthesis. Herein, a mild and universal vapor–solid interface synthesis strategy is developed for highly crystalline CTFs employing trifluoromethanesulfonic acid vapor as catalysts. A series of highly ordered simple and functional CTFs (CTF‐TJUs) can be facilely produced. In particular, the porphyrin‐involved functional CTF (CTF‐TJU‐Por1) with high crystallinity is synthesized for the first time via this universal approach. The mechanism of vapor‐catalyzed trimerization of nitrile monomers is thoroughly investigated through semi in situ characterizations. As a proof of concept, the photocatalytic performance of synthesized CTFs for water splitting is evaluated. CTF‐TJU‐133 exhibits significantly greater photocatalytic rates for hydrogen (4.35 µmol h −1 ) and oxygen (2.18 µmol h −1 ) evolutions during overall water splitting under visible light irradiations compared to other CTF‐TJUs, representing one of the highest values among reported CTF photocatalysts. Further studies reveal that enhanced photocatalytic performance of CTF‐TJU‐133 results from optimized band structure, extended visible‐light absorption, and high carrier separation efficiency. This study provides a promising strategy to synthesize various simple and functional CTFs, which significantly enriched diversities of CTF family for different application purposes.

The stars of the Milky Way carry the chemical history of our Galaxy in their atmospheres as they journey through its vast expanse. Like barcodes, we can extract the chemical fingerprints of stars from high-resolution spectroscopy. The fourth data release (DR4) of the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey, based on a decade of observations, provides the chemical abundances of up to 32 elements for 917 588 stars that also have exquisite astrometric data from the $Gaia$ satellite. For the first time, these elements include life-essential nitrogen to complement carbon, and oxygen as well as more measurements of rare-earth elements critical to modern-life electronics, offering unparalleled insights into the chemical composition of the Milky Way. For this release, we use neural networks to simultaneously fit stellar parameters and abundances across the full spectrum, leveraging synthetic grids computed with Spectroscopy Made Easy. These grids account for atomic line formation in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium for 14 elements. In a two-iteration process, we first fit stellar labels for all 1 085 520 spectra, then co-add repeated observations and refine these labels using astrometric data from $Gaia$ and 2MASS photometry, improving the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters and abundances. Our validation thoroughly assesses the reliability of spectroscopic measurements and highlights key caveats for catalogue users. GALAH DR4 represents yet another milestone in Galactic archaeology, combining detailed chemical compositions from multiple nucleosynthetic channels with kinematic information and age estimates. The resulting dataset, covering nearly a million stars, opens new avenues for understanding not only the chemical and dynamical history of the Milky Way, but also the broader questions of the origin of elements and the evolution of planets, stars, and galaxies.

Context: The details of the mass-loss process in the late stages of low- and intermediate-mass stellar evolution are not well understood, in particular its dependence on stellar parameters. Mira variables are highly suitable targets for studying this mass-loss process. Aims: We follow up on our earlier finding that a near-to-mid-infrared colour vs. pulsation period diagram shows two sequences of Miras that can be distinguished by the third dredge-up (3DUP) indicator technetium in those stars. While IR colours are good indicators of the dust mass-loss rate (MLR) from Miras, no corresponding sequences have been found using the gas MLR. However, investigations of the gas MLR have been hampered by data limitations. We aim to alleviate these limitations with new observational data. Methods: We present new optical spectra of a well-selected sample of Miras. We searched these spectra for absorption lines of Tc and other 3DUP indicators and combined our findings with gas MLRs and expansion velocities from the literature. Furthermore, we analyse WISE MIR data and compare the broadband SEDs of Miras with and without Tc. Results: We find no systematic difference in gas MLRs between Miras with and without Tc. However, the gas envelopes of Tc-poor Miras appear to have a higher expansion velocity than those of Miras with Tc. Furthermore, our analysis of the IR photometry strongly corroborates the earlier finding that Tc-poor Miras have a higher MIR emission than Tc-rich ones, by as much as a factor of two. We model the IR colours with DARWIN and stationary wind models and conclude that Miras with and without Tc have different dust content or properties. Conclusions: We discuss several hypotheses of the observations and conclude that the reduction of free oxygen by 3DUP of carbon and iron-depleted dust grains in Tc-rich stars are the most convincing explanations for our observations.

The origin of volatile elements, the timing of their accretion and their distribution during Earth’s differentiation are fundamental aspects of Earth’s early evolution. Here, we present the result of a newly developed accretion and core formation model, which features the results of high P–T metal–silicate partitioning experiments. The model includes well-studied reference elements (Fe, Ni, Ca, Al, Mg, Si) as well as trace elements (V, Ga, Ag, Au, S) covering a wide range from refractory to volatile behavior. The accretion model simulates the different steps of planet formation, such as the effects of continuous, heterogenous core formation at high P–T, the effect of the Moon-forming giant impact and the addition of matter after the core formation was completed, the so-called “late veneer”. To explore the “core formation signature” of the volatile depletion patterns and the quantitative influence of a late veneer, we modeled planets that would have formed from known materials, such as CI, CM, CV, CO, EH and EL meteorites, and from a hypothetical volatile depleted material, CI*. Some of the resulting planets are Earth-like in key properties, such as overall core size, major element composition, oxygen fugacity and trace element composition. The model predicts the chemical signatures of the main planetary reservoirs, the metallic core and bulk silicate planet (BSP) of the modeled planets, which we compare with the chemical signature of Earth derived previously from core formation models and mass balance-based approaches. We show that planets accreted from volatile depleted carbonaceous chondrites (CM, CV, CO and CI*) are closest in terms of major element (Si, Mg, Fe, Ca, Al, Ni) and also siderophile volatile element (Ge, Ga, Au) concentrations to the components from which Earth accreted. Chalcophile volatile elements (S, Ag), instead, require an additional process to lower their concentrations in the BSP to Earth-like concentrations, perhaps the late segregation of a sulfide melt.

We explore the relations between the gas-phase metallicity radial profiles (few hundred inner parsec) and multiple galaxy properties for 15 Seyfert galaxies from the AGNIFS (Active Galactic Nuclei Integral Field Spectroscopy) sample using optical Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations from Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) processed archival data. The data were selected at $z \lesssim 0.013$ within black hole mass range $\left[6<\log \left(M_{\rm BH}/{\rm M_\odot} \right)<9\right]$ with moderate 14--150\,keV X-ray luminosities $\left[42\,\lesssim\,\log L_X (\rm erg\,s^{-1})\,\lesssim\,44\right]$. We estimated the gas-phase metallicity using the strong-line methods and found mean values for the oxygen dependent ($Z \sim 0.75Z_\odot$) and nitrogen dependent ($Z \sim 1.14Z_\odot$) calibrations. These estimates show excellent agreement with $\Delta Z \approx 0.19$ dex and $\Delta Z \approx 0.18$ dex between the mean values from the two strong-line calibrations for GMOS and MUSE respectively, consistent with the order of metallicity uncertainty via the strong-line methods. We contend that our findings align with a scenario wherein local Seyferts have undergone seamless gas accretion histories, resulting in positive metallicity profile over an extended period of time, thereby providing insights into galaxy evolution and the chemical enrichment or depletion of the universe. Additionally, we argue that metal-poor gas inflow from the local interstellar medium (ISM) and accreted through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) onto the galaxy systems regulates the star formation processes by diluting their central metallicity and inverting their metallicity gradients, producing a more prominent anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and Eddington ratio.
