Bifunctional electrode materials are highly desirable for meeting increasing global energy demands and mitigating environmental impact. However, improving the atom-efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of storage systems, as well as optimizing conversion processes to enhance overall energy utilization and sustainability, remains a significant challenge for their application. Herein, we devised an optimized, facile, economic, and scalable synthesis of large area (cm2), ultrathin (∼2.9 ± 0.3 nm) electroactive nanosheet of β-Ni(OH)2, which acted as bifunctional electrode material for charge storage and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The β-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet electrode shows the volumetric capacity of 2.82 Ah.cm−3(0.82 µAh.cm−2) at the current density of 0.2 mA.cm−2. The device shows a high capacity of 820 mAh.cm−3 with an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 0.33 Wh.cm−3 at 275.86 W.cm−3 along with promising stability (30,000 cycles). Furthermore, the OER activity of ultrathin β-Ni(OH)2 exhibits an overpotential (η10) of 308 mV and a Tafel value of 42 mV dec-1 suggesting fast reaction kinetics. The mechanistic studies are enlightened through density functional theory (DFT), which reveals that additional electronic states near the Fermi level enhance activity for both capacitance and OER.

Developing a non-noble metal-based bifunctional electrocatalyst with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting is desirable for renewable energy systems. We developed a novel method to fabricate a heterostructured electrocatalyst, comprising a NiCoP nanoneedle array grown on Ti3C2Tx MXene-coated Ni foam (NCP-MX/NF) using a dip-coating hydrothermal method, followed by phosphorization. Due to the abundance of active sites, enhanced electronic kinetics, and sufficient electrolyte accessibility resulting from the synergistic effects of NCP and MXene, NCP-MX/NF bifunctional alkaline catalysts afford superb electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (72 mV at 10 mA cm–2 for HER and 303 mV at 50 mA cm–2 for OER), a low Tafel slope (49.2 mV dec–1 for HER and 69.5 mV dec–1 for OER), and long-term stability. Moreover, the overall water splitting performance of NCP-MX/NF, which requires potentials as low as 1.54 and 1.76 V at a current density of 10 and 50 mA cm–2, respectively, exceeded the performance of the Pt/C∥IrO2 couple in terms of overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the NCP/Ti3C2O2 interface model predicted the catalytic contribution to interfacial formation by analyzing the electronic redistribution at the interface. This contribution was also evaluated by calculating the adsorption energetics of the descriptor molecules (H2O and the H and OER intermediates).

Abstract Suppressing the kinetically favorable lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism pathway and triggering the adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway at the expense of activity are the state-of-the-art strategies for Ru-based electrocatalysts toward acidic water oxidation. Herein, atomically dispersed Ru species are anchored into an acidic stable vinyl-linked 2D covalent organic framework with unique crossed π-conjugation, termed as COF-205-Ru. The crossed π-conjugated structure of COF-205-Ru not only suppresses the dissolution of Ru through strong Ru-N motifs, but also reduces the oxidation state of Ru by multiple π-conjugations, thereby activating the oxygen coordinated to Ru and stabilizing the oxygen vacancies during oxygen evolution process. Experimental results including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ powder X-ray diffraction patterns, and theoretical calculations unveil the activated oxygen with elevated energy level of O 2 p band, decreased oxygen vacancy formation energy, promoted electrochemical stability, and significantly reduced energy barrier of potential determining step for acidic water oxidation. Consequently, the obtained COF-205-Ru displays a high mass activity with 2659.3 A g −1 , which is 32-fold higher than the commercial RuO 2 , and retains long-term durability of over 280 h. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously promote the stability and activity of Ru-based catalysts for acidic water oxidation.

Abstract Cobalt (Co)-based oxides show promising activity as precious metal-free catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but the dissolution of Co has limited the durability of Co3O4 at industrially relevant current densities. This work demonstrates that cation in an octahedral coordination environment accounts for the oxygen evolution activity. Using a mixed inverse-normal phase spinel CoxGa(3-x)O4 as a proof-of-concept example, the designed Co2+-O-Co3+ motifs in octahedral sites trigger oxygen evolution through a kinetically favorable radical coupling pathway. Furthermore, lattice oxygen exchange, a leading factor in catalyst structural degradation for normal Co3O4, is suppressed, as evidenced by isotopic labeling experiments and theoretical calculations. With the optimized catalyst, Co1.8Ga1.2O4, we report an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA/cm2, stable operation at 200 mA/cm2 for 200 hours in a three-electrode setup, and a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer operating at 200 mA/cm2 for 450 hours.

Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly energy source that can be extracted from water through electrolysis. However, the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side is the main obstacle to the widespread use of water-splitting devices. This study used self-developed highly porous nickel structures (SMNF) and commercial nickel foam (CNF) as working electrodes in the electrolysis process. Iron (II, III) Oxide (Fe 3 O 4 ) as a catalyst is coated with a dip coating technique on the Ni porous structure and then calcined using a laser process to produce a Ni-Fe 3 O 4 -based electrode. Electrochemical test results show that the presence of Fe 3 O 4 significantly impacts high reaction kinetics. The SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 demonstrated an overpotential of 217,3 mV at 1 M KOH electrolyte, at a current density of 10 mA, lower to SMNF electrode without Fe 3 O 4 with an overpotential of 361,4 mV under the same conditions. In addition, the difference in porosity less significantly affects the electrode's effectiveness due to the slight difference in mass loading, which is only < 5 mg. However, electro-impedance spectroscopy (EIS) testing shows better performance on SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 with a smaller electrical series resistance (ESR), around 0.638 Ω, compared to CNF-Fe 3 O 4 , which is 0.767 Ω. Overall, observations by chronoamperometry test at an overpotential of 155 mV at 5 hrs show stable performance of SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 electrodes.

Abstract Transition metal sulfides (TMS) exhibit significant promise as non‐noble‐metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments, notwithstanding their susceptibility to long‐term instability due to the gradual leaching of surface‐reconstructed sulfate ions (SO 4 2− ). In this study, a sulfate ion‐assisted strategy is proposed to stabilize the surface‐reconstructed SO 4 2− of FeNiS 2 . The findings reveal that SO 4 2− experiences considerable loss in KOH due to the infinite concentration gradient of SO 4 2− on the surface. Conversely, in K 2 SO 4 /KOH, this strategy mitigates rapid leaching and preserves the predominant surface‐reconstructed SO 4 2− , thereby enhancing stability in both accelerated degradation (5000 cycles) and long‐term (≥120 h) tests, with ≈95% current density retained. Furthermore, the optimal concentration of SO 4 2− proves to be crucial, as supported by both experimental and theoretical results. This approach offers insights into bolstering the long‐term OER stability of TMS and similar compounds, thereby advancing the prospects for widespread application in electrocatalytic water splitting.

Designing and developing suitable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity and stability remain challenging in electrolytic water splitting. Hence, NiFe@NC@MoS2 core-bishell composites wrapped by molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and nitrogen-doped graphene (NC) were prepared using hydrothermal synthesis in this research. NiFe@NC@MoS2 composite exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 288mV and a Tafel slope of 53.2 mV·dec−1 at a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution, which is superior to commercial RuO2. NC and MoS2 bishells create profuse edge active sites that enhance the adsorption ability of OOH* while lowering the overall overpotential of the product and improving its oxygen precipitation performance. The density function theory(DFT) analysis confirms that the layered MoS2 in NiFe@NC@MoS2 provides additional edge active sites and enhances electron transfer, thus increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity. This research paves a novel way for developing OER electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic performance.

The unsatisfactory oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics caused by the inherent lean-oxygen marine environment brings low power density for metal-dissolved oxygen seawater batteries (SWBs). In this study, we propose a seawater/electrode interfacial engineering strategy by constructing a hydrophobic coating to realize enhanced mass transfer of dissolved oxygen for the fully immersed cathode of SWBs. Accumulation of dissolved oxygen from seawater to the catalyst is particularly beneficial for improving the ORR performance under lean-oxygen conditions. As a result, SWB assembled with a hydrophobic cathode achieved a power density of up to 2.32 mW cm–2 and sustained discharge at 1.3 V for 250 h. Remarkably, even in environments with an oxygen concentration of 4 mg L–1, it can operate at a voltage approximately 100 mV higher than that of an unmodified SWB. The introduction of a hydrophobic interface enhances the discharge voltage and power of SWBs by improving interfacial oxygen mass transfer, providing new insights into improving the underwater ORR performance for practical SWBs.

Abstract To address the substantial energy needs of the quickly evolving modern civilization, efforts are still needed to provide sustainable renewable energy sources. The electrocatalytic Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the essential technologies used in the various hydrogen production techniques. ZIF‐67 nanocubes (ZIF‐67 NCs) were synthesized in an aqueous solution and used as sacrificial templates. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate was added under water bath conditions, resulting in the evolution of numerous small layered layers of cobalt hydroxide. This ultimately led to the formation of multilayered, three‐dimensionally crosslinked Co‐LDH with a porous networked cubic morphology. Hydrolysis of Co 2+ at different concentrations produces different degrees of weak acidic environments, and the loose LDH on the cubic structure of the best catalyst, Co‐LDH‐1, exposes more active cobalt sites for the OER, which results in a high electrochemically active surface area, with an overpotential of 354 mV and a Tafel slope of 79.06 mV dec −1 at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and good stability and low activation under alkaline condition also has good stability and low activation energy. It provides us an easy and practical plan for logically creating ZIF‐derived hydroxide materials, leading to the development of affordable and effective electrocatalysts.

Thin‐film encapsulation plays an essential role in the stability of flexible displays. Although Al 2 O 3 film has good water‐oxygen barrier properties, its bending performance needs to be enhanced. This paper inserts Alucone into Al 2 O 3 film to generate Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film with good barrier and bending performance to improve the encapsulated devices. The finite element analyzing approach and the calcium dot arrays test are employed to investigate the influence of structural ratio and overlapping density on the water‐oxygen barrier and mechanical properties of the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film. The results show that the proportion of Alucone sublayers in the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film (with a total thickness of 60 nm) is directly proportional to the overlapping structure's ability to disperse stresses and inversely proportional to the overlapping structure's water‐oxygen barrier property. When the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping structure ratio is 1:1, the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film can balance the bending and barrier properties. The bending property of Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film (Al 2 O 3 /Alucone ratio is 1:1, total thickness is 60 nm) diminishes with increasing overlapping density, and its water‐oxygen barrier property increases and then drops. Combining the results of the simulation and calcium dot arrays test, it is apparent that when the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone ratio is 1:1 and the overlapping density is 5, the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film has good bending and barrier performance. This is expected to promote the development of commercial flexible display technology.

Abstract Photocatalysis is a promising technique due to its capacity to efficiently harvest solar energy and its potential to address the global energy crisis. However, the structure–activity relationships of photocatalyst during wavelength-dependent photocatalytic reactions remains largely unexplored because it is difficult to measure under operating conditions. Here we show the photocatalytic strain evolution of a single Au nanoparticle (AuNP) supported on a TiO 2 film by combining three-dimensional (3D) Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging with an external light source. The wavelength-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has significant effects on the structural deformation of the AuNP, leading to its strain evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to rationalize the induced strain caused by the adsorption of ROS on the AuNP surface. These observations provide insights of how the photocatalytic activity impacts on the structural deformation of AuNP, contributing to the general understanding of the atomic-level catalytic adsorption process.

Nickel-based sulfides have been proven to be excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts due to their excellent electrical conductivity, but their poor stability hinders their application in practical applications. To address this issue, defect engineering has been proposed as a viable strategy to enhance the electronic structure of the catalyst and further boost the OER performance. Herein, a MOF-derived Sn-doped NiS/Ni3S2 nanostructure grown in situ on nickel foam (Sn–NixSy/NF) has been designed as an active OER electrocatalyst. The morphology of the material was significantly impacted by the addition of the Sn elements, nanorods modified with nanoparticles providing more active sites. Moreover, the introduction of Sn elements induced the generation of sulfur vacancies (Vs), enhanced electron transfer, promoted electron redistribution, and increased the charge transfer rate. All of these endow the Sn–NixSy/NF-T with exceptionally low overpotentials of 104 and 286 mV to achieve a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm–2 for OER. Moreover, the Sn–NixSy/NF-T showed long-term stability, maintaining 100 h at current densities of 100 mA cm–2. In short, this work opened a route for engineering defects to boost the OER.

As the anode reaction of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main obstacles to the practical application of PEMWE due to its sluggish four-electron transfer process. The development of high-performance acidic OER electrocatalysts has become the key to improving the reaction kinetics. To date, although various excellent acidic OER electrocatalysts have been widely researched, Ir-based nanomaterials are still state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Hence, a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of Ir-based electrocatalysts is crucial for the precise optimization of catalytic performance. In this review, the origin and nature of the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the derived volcanic relationship on Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER processes are summarized and some optimization strategies for Ir-based electrocatalysts based on the AEM are introduced. To further investigate the development strategy of high-performance Ir-based electrocatalysts, several unconventional OER mechanisms including dual-site mechanism and lattice oxygen mediated mechanism, and their applications are introduced in detail. Thereafter, the active species on Ir-based electrocatalysts at acidic OER are summarized and classified into surface Ir species and O species. Finally, the future development direction and prospect of Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER are put forward.

Chirality-induced spin selectivity observed in chiral 2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite holds promise to achieve spin-dependent electrochemistry. However, conventional chiral 2D perovskites suffer from low conductivity and hygroscopicity, limiting electrochemical performance and operational stability. Here, a cutting-edge material design is introduced to develop a stable and efficient chiral perovskite-based spin polarizer by employing fluorinated chiral cation. The fluorination approach effectively promotes the charge carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction by mitigating the dielectric confinement effect within the multi-quantum well-structured 2D perovskite. Integrating the fluorinated cation incorporated spin polarizer with BiVO

Oxygen vacancies are generally considered to play a crucial role in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the generation of active sites created by oxygen vacancies is inevitably restricted by their condensation and elimination reactions. To overcome this limitation, here, we demonstrate a novel photoelectric reconstruction strategy to incorporate atomically dispersed Cu into ultrathin (about 2–3 molecular) amorphous oxyhydroxide (a-CuM, M = Co, Ni, Fe, or Zn), facilitating deprotonation of the reconstructed oxyhydroxide to generate high-valence Cu. The in situ XAFS results and first-principles calculations reveal that Cu atoms are stabilized at high valence during the OER process due to Jahn–Teller distortion, resulting in para-type double oxygen vacancies as dynamically stable catalytic sites. The optimal a-CuCo catalyst exhibits a record-high mass activity of 3404.7 A g–1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, superior to the benchmarking hydroxide and oxide catalysts. The developed photoelectric reconstruction strategy opens up a new pathway to construct in situ stable oxygen vacancies by high-valence Cu single sites, which extends the design rules for creating dynamically stable active sites.

High-temperature sintering is critical for efficient hematite photoanodes in terms of improving the crystallinity and minimizing deficiencies. However, prolonged conventional furnace annealing requires high energy consumption and simultaneously results in serious damage to the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate. This work demonstrates a universal wet-interfacial Joule heating strategy for rapidly synthesizing high-performance metastable protohematite photoanodes, which greatly decreases the power consumption and causes less damage to the TCO substrate by shortening the sintering time to ∼90 s. More importantly, the protohematite phase was found to effectively facilitate the charge dynamics in the bulk and surface of the as-resulting photoanode by increasing donor density and lowering the oxygen evolution reaction overpotential via offering dual active sites (lattice oxygen and Fe sites). Moreover, this annealing strategy could be well coupled with commonly used Ti-treatment to achieve a further performance enhancement and also shows high feasibility in rapidly fabricating efficient TiO2 and BiVO4 photoanodes. This study opens a facile, rapid, and reliable approach for fabricating efficient metal oxide photoanodes, contributing to the development of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Designing cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting is a significant challenge. We have systematically investigated a series of quasi-2D oxides, LaSrMn0.5M0.5O4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the two half-reactions of water-splitting, namely oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). The four materials are isostructural, as confirmed by Rietveld refinements with X-ray diffraction. The oxygen contents and metal valence states were determined by iodometric titrations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrical conductivity measurements in a wide range of temperatures revealed semiconducting behavior for all four materials. Electrocatalytic properties were studied for both half-reactions of water-splitting, namely, oxygen-evolution and hydrogen-evolution reactions (OER and HER). For the four materials, the trends in both OER and HER were the same, which also matched the trend in electrical conductivities. Among them, LaSrMn0.5Co0.5O4 showed the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both OER and HER, which may be attributed to its higher electrical conductivity and favorable electron configuration.

Transition-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have attracted widespread attention due to their inexpensive prices, unique layered structures, and rich active sites. Currently, designing low-cost, sustainable, and simple synthesis methods is essential for the application of transition-metal-based catalysts. Here, magnetic field (MF)-assisted chemical corrosion, as a novel technology, is adopted to construct superior OER electrocatalysts. The produced Ni(Fe)(OH)2-Fe2O3 electrode exhibits an overpotential of 272 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm−2, presenting a 64 mV reduction compared to the electrode without an MF. The experimental results indicate that an MF can induce the directional growth of Fe2O3 rods and reduce their accumulation. In addition, an external MF is beneficial for the lattice dislocation of the obtained catalysts, which can increase the surface free energy, thus reducing the activation energy and accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics. This work effectively combines a magnetic field with chemical corrosion and electrochemical energy, which offers a novel strategy for the large-scale development of environmentally friendly and superior electrocatalysts.

Abstract Doping transition metal oxide spinels with metal ions represents a significant strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Herein, a bimetallic Fe and Ru doping strategy to fine‐tune the crystal structure of CoV 2 O 4 spinel for highly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is presented performance. The incorporation of Fe and Ru is observed at octahedral sites within the CoV 2 O 4 structure, effectively modulating the electronic configuration of Co. Density functional theory calculations have confirmed that Fe acts as a novel reactive site, replacing V. Additionally, the synergistic effect of Fe, Co, and Ru effectively optimizes the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate species, reduces the reaction energy barrier, and accelerates the kinetics toward OER. As expected, the best‐performing CoVFe 0.5 Ru 0.5 O 4 displays a low overpotential of 240 mV (@10 mA cm −2 ) and a remarkably low Tafel slope of 38.9 mV dec −1 , surpassing that of commercial RuO 2 . Moreover, it demonstrates outstanding long‐term durability lasting for 72 h. This study provides valuable insights for the design of highly active polymetallic spinel electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.

Despite the challenges associated with the synthesis of flexible metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), these offer the unique advantage of maximizing the atomic utilization efficiency. However, the construction of flexible MCOFs with flexible building units or linkages has rarely been reported. In this study, novel flexible MCOFs are constructed using flexible building blocks and copper clusters with hydrazone linkages. The heterometallic frameworks (Cu, Co) are prepared through the hydrazone linkage coordination method and evaluated as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to the spatial separation and functional cooperation of the heterometallic MCOF catalysts, the as-synthesized MCOFs exhibited outstanding catalytic activities with an overpotential of 268.8 mV at 10 mA cm

Abstract This study investigates the environmentally friendly synthesis of ZrO 2 ‐NdO mixed nanomaterial using green reducing and capping agents derived from the plant Amaranthus viridis . X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of the mixed nanomaterial, revealing an optical band gap of 2.5 eV. The morphology was characterized by spherical‐shaped particles with an average size ranging from 66 to 77 nm. The synthesized ZrO 2 ‐NdO mixed nanomaterial was evaluated for its potential application as an electrode material in energy devices, specifically for pseudocapacitors and water splitting studies. Electrochemical performance was assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) techniques. Notably, a specific capacitance of 573.5 F/g was achieved through CV at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. Fabricated electrocatalyst was further analyzed for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the results showed better over potential value of 164 mV for HER studies. The stability analysis further endorsed the large‐scale commercialization possibility of ZrO‐NdO‐based electrode material.

The water electrolysis is mostly limited by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) including the interfacial electron and mass transfer and autoionization reactions. Especially in the neutral pH condition, slow rate of the autoionization reaction of water molecules also limits the electrolysis. The vibrational strong coupling, where the matter excitation is coupled to the cavity vacuum field mediated by a virtual photon, can be expected to modulate the physicochemical properties of water. Here, we utilized the cavity-arrayed electrode for the promotion of the OER. The OER activities of Ni cavity-array electrodes were evaluated from the oxygen bubble growth behavior. The Tafel slopes from the bubble analyses were modulated from 120 mV per decade to 30 mV per decade and the OER activity was enhanced by the cavity-arrayed electrode. This enhancement was explained with regards to the acceleration of autoionization of water molecules under the vibrational strong coupling. This study demonstrates that the cavity systems modulate the thermodynamic equilibrium of water autoionization under the vibrational strong coupling of liquid water at room temperature, leading to enhanced OER.

The fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution in aqueous environment has far-reaching significance. Especially, reasonable interface process regulation toward heterogeneous composites can make full use of the active sites and improve the electrocatalytic activity. In this study, we designed and synthesized NiS2-MoS2-based heterogeneous composites as efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline electrolyte. The heterostructure was obtained by one-step hydrothermal ulfurization operation towards polymolybdate-based metal-organic complex. The composition and nanostructures can be tailored by modulating experiment parameter, realizing the phase-controlled synthesis and interface regulation: (1) High-percentage of 1T-MoS2 can be achieved via selecting appropriate vulcanization time and thiourea concentration, benifiting for the higher electroconductivity and more active sites; (2) Regular and orderly vulcanization time promotes the gradual growth and aggregation of nanosheets; (3) The existence of nickel hydroxide improves the electrocatalytic stability for oxygen production performance. The optimized heterogeneous interfaces provide sufficient active sites and accelerate electron transfer. Consequently, the optimal heterogeneous nanosheets present low overpotentials of 33 and 122 mV at the catalytic current densities of 10 mA/cm2 for HER and OER, respectively.

Among hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis stands out, but its efficiency is hampered by the substantial energy barrier of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To address this, incorporating electron‐deficient boron (B) into Co–Fe hydroxide (CoFeO x H y ) promotes higher oxidation states of involved metals, greatly enhancing OER activity and charge transfer capabilities. Herein, the synthesis of a range of amorphous CoFeB nanoparticles with varying Fe to (Co+Fe) atomic ratios achieved through a simple chemical reduction method using CoFe‐Prussian blue analogs as precursors and employing Mössbauer spectroscopy to observe structural characteristics before and after transformation is reported. Among these nanoparticles, the CoFe 0.25 B variant, exhibiting favorable electrochemical properties, is chosen and subsequently subjected to hydrolysis to yield CoFe 0.25 BOH nanoparticles, serving as an active catalyst for OER. At a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , the overpotentials for CoFe 0.25 O x H y and CoFe 0.25 BOH are 362 and 310 mV, respectively, with Tafel slopes decreasing from 393 to 93 mV dec −1 . Furthermore, the i – t test reveals no significant loss of electrochemical performance within 24 h, substantiating the efficacy of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of CoFeO x H y through the introduction of electron‐deficient elements. This research offers novel insights into the development of efficient and stable water electrolysis catalysts.

Cesium doped WO3 (Cs-WO3) photocatalyst with high and stable oxidation activity was successfully synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method using Cs2CO3 as the doped metal ion source and tungstic acid (H2WO4) as the tungsten source. A series of analytical characterization tools and oxygen precipitation activity tests were used to compare the effects of different additions of Cs2CO3 on the crystal structure and microscopic morphologies. The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of Cs-doped material exhibited a significant red shift in the absorption edge with new shoulders appearing at 440–520 nm. The formation of an oxygen vacancy was confirmed in Cs-WO3 by the EPR signal, which can effectively regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst surface and contribute to improving the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The photocatalytic OER results showed that the Cs-WO3-0.1 exhibited the optimal oxygen precipitation activity, reaching 58.28 µmol at 6 h, which was greater than six times higher than that of WO3-0 (9.76 μmol). It can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the increase in the conduction band position of Cs-WO3-0.1 (0.11 V) and oxygen vacancies compared to WO3-0, which accelerate the electron conduction rate and slow down the rapid compounding of photogenerated electrons–holes, improving the water-catalytic oxygen precipitation activity of WO3.

The key to enhancing water electrolysis efficiency lies in selecting highly efficient catalysts. Currently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are utilized in electrocatalysis applications owing to their diverse elemental composition, disordered elemental distribution, and the high solubility of each element, endowing them with excellent catalytic performance. The experiments were conducted using isoatomic FeNiCrMo HEA as a precursor, with a high-activity three-dimensional nanoporous structure rapidly synthesized via electrochemical one-step dealloying in a choline chloride-thiourea (ChCl-TU) deep eutectic solvent (DES). The results indicate that the dealloyed Fe

Mixed metal oxides (MMOs) are a promising class of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Despite their importance for sustainable energy schemes, our understanding of relevant reaction pathways, catalytically active sites, and synergistic effects is rather limited. Here, we applied synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to explore the evolution of the amorphous Co-Cu-W MMO electrocatalyst, shown previously to be an efficient bifunctional OER and HER catalyst for water splitting. Ex situ XAS measurements provided structural environments and the oxidation state of the metals involved, revealing Co

Abstract High‐entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted significant attention for electrocatalytic energy conversion by virtue of their promisingly high efficiency, stability, and low cost. Recently, encouraging progress has been made in tuning the structure and composition of HEAs used in electrolyzers and fuel cells. However, the understanding on the synthetic methods and the structure‐property‐performance relationship of well‐defined HEAs nanostructures is still inadequate. To gain insight into the future research directions on HEAs for electrocatalysis, in this paper, the synthetic methods commonly used to obtain well‐defined HEAs nanostructures (0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets/nanoplates, 3D nanoporous structures, and other three‐dimensional morphologies) are first summarized. Then, the authors discuss the application of well‐defined HEAs nanostructures in several typical electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and formic acid oxidation reaction. Finally, a practical perspective on the future research directions on well‐defined HEAs nanostructured electrocatalysts is provided.

An atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is used to process electrochemically deposited NiFe on carbon paper (NiFe/CP). The reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONs) of the APPJ modify the surface properties, chemical bonding types, and oxidation states of the material at the self-sustained temperature of the APPJ. The APPJ treatment further enhances the hydrophilicity and creates a higher disorder level in the carbon material. Moreover, the metal carbide bonds of NiFe/CP formed in the electrochemical deposition (ED) process are converted to metal oxide bonds after APPJ processing. The potential application of APPJ treatment on NiFe/CP in alkaline water electrolysis is demonstrated. With more oxygen-containing species and better hydrophilicity after APPJ treatment, APPJ-treated NiFe/CP is applied as the electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis. APPJ-treated NiFe/CP is also used in a custom-made anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE); this should contribute toward realizing the practical large-scale application of AEM for hydrogen production.

Carbon Dots (CDs) have gained significant attention for their fascinating optical properties, potential applications, and puzzling structural challenges. In the last decade, CDs have become the focal point in many photocatalysis studies, either as independent systems or combined with other established photocatalysts. CDs play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of heterostructures for overall water splitting, hydrogen (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In these "Concepts," we briefly explore the structure of CDs, highlighting their critical aspects, including their role within heterostructures, composition, the presence of fluorophores, and the interaction between the graphitic core and surface functional groups. We will also examine how these factors impact their photocatalytic properties, particularly in the context of future research on H₂ production.

Cobalt phosphates are efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the rate-determining step in water splitting. However, the role of water crystallization in OER electrocatalysis is not well understood, limiting the systematic design of such catalysts. This study compares Co3(PO4)2·4H2O (CoPO-25) and Co3(PO4)2 (CoPO-25NW) nanoflakes to highlight the importance of water of crystallization. The results show that water of crystallization increases the oxygen vacancy concentration, enhances electrical conductivity, and modifies electronic structure, leading to higher catalytic activity for CoPO-25. Additionally, the water of crystallization sustains the structural stability of CoPO-25, preventing complete hydroxylation conversion. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the water of crystallization in CoPO-25 is crucial for modifying binding interactions between reaction intermediates and the catalyst. This study not only presents a promising electrocatalyst but also provides insights into the impact of water crystallization in cobalt phosphates on the OER.

Polymetallic cationic spinel-type oxides are increasingly being used as catalysts for oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Here, we have modified the anti-spinel Co2MnO4 using a quenching strategy (CMO-Q) and demonstrated that the bidirectional migration of Co and Mn cations at the tetrahedral/octahedral positions is the essential reason for enhancing the ORR/OER performance. Electrochemical test results show that CMO-Q is better than Co2MnO4, OER initial potential decreased by 100 mV, and ORR current density increased from 4.2 to 7.3 mA cm−2 at 1600 rpm, with more stable CMO-Q-based zinc–air battery performance. Meanwhile, density functional theory calculations confirm that the primary factor contributing to the reduction of distance from the d-band center of Co and Mn to the Fermi level is the conductivity enhancement. This study offers insight into regulating the surface atomic migration and catalytic performance of spinel without compromising its stable structure.

Herein, we construct amorphous molybdenum oxide films by thermal atomic layer deposition (T‐ALD) and plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE‐ALD). The physical and chemical properties of molybdenum oxide films prepared by the two methods were systematically compared by means of film growth law, atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscope etc. The results show that the amorphous molybdenum oxide physical phase prepared by both atomic layer deposition methods is MoO 3 . Compared with T‐ALD MoO 3 , the growth rate of MoO 3 thin films prepared by PE‐ALD is higher. Compared to PE‐ALD MoO 3 , the MoO 3 films prepared by T‐ALD did not have nucleation delayed to a laminar growth mode, resulting in smoother deposited films and contained less impurity carbon. The MoO 3 prepared by PE‐ALD contains 7.4% impurity carbon. This carbon‐doped film significantly improves the conductivity of the MoO 3 film and shows good electrochemical activity. As expected, the MoO 3 films prepared by PE‐ALD show good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The overpotential was only 259 mV at 10 mA cm ‐2 and continued to evolution oxygen for 60 h with almost no attenuation, indicating that carbon doping significantly improves the catalytic intrinsic activity and stability of MoO 3 .

Titanium (Ti) is widely used as anode current collectors in proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based water electrolyzers due to its self-passivated oxide layer, which protects it from corrosion in acidic solutions. However, the cost of the material and machining process for Ti is high. A wider utilization of water electrolyzers to produce hydrogen could be favored by the use of less expensive coated aluminum (Al) substrates, which could potentially replace high-cost Ti-based components. It is shown here by depositing a pinhole-free oxygen vacancy-rich titanium oxide (TiOx) protection layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD), the corrosion resistance of Al substrates in acidic environments at oxygen evolution potentials can be enhanced. The optimization of the oxygen vacancy concentration is accomplished by tuning the ALD parameters to achieve ideal stoichiometry and conformal coating on rough substrates. The robustness of the coatings was evaluated at high potentials (2.4 V vs NHE = normal hydrogen electrode) in low pH conditions. A low TiOx dissolution rate of the order of ∼6 nm year–1 was observed. By testing under industrially relevant conditions, i.e., high applied voltages (2.4 V) and low pH, an Al loss at around the zero ppb level was achieved using optimized ALD parameters. It is proposed that a 40 nm TiOx coating on Al may be adequate to provide 60,000 h of durability in a PEM water electrolyzer anode current collector.

Abstract An urgent challenge to the development of rechargeable Zn–air batteries (RZABs) is the highly active, durable, and low‐cost catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER). Herein, a carbon‐based monolithic catalyst is designed via anchoring P‐modified MnCo 2 O 4 inverse spinel nanoparticles on biomass‐derived carbon (P‐MnCo 2 O 4 @PWC). The introduction of surface P atoms regulates the electronic structures and valences of metal atoms by adjusting the coordination fields by (P‐O) δ– and Metal‐P. The optimization of the adsorption behavior of key intermediates facilitates the activation and conversion of reaction species. The monolithic structure is beneficial to the construction of a three‐phase interface for efficient mass transfer and high electrical conductivity. The P‐MnCo 2 O 4 @PWC catalyst displays outstanding bifunctional catalytic properties with a thin Δ E (the difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm – 2 and the ORR halfwave potential) of 0.66 V. The RZAB with P‐MnCo 2 O 4 @PWC as cathode delivers an exceptional peak power density (160 mW cm – 2 ) and remarkable cycle life (over 1200 cycles), overcoming those with noble metal counterparts. This research provides a promising general surface‐phosphorization way to the design of carbon electrocatalysts and the high‐value utilization of biomass.

Electrochemical water splitting, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a promising hydrogen production technology. However, in practice, the high overpotentials and sluggish reaction kinetics associated with the anode OER process are the major obstacles to the smooth progress of electrocatalytic water splitting. Amorphous electrocatalysts, a crucial family of functional materials, exhibit unexpected performance due to their special short‐range ordered and long‐range disordered atom arrangement, abundant defect sites and adjustable composition. To date, while numerous recent publications showcase promising results for transition metal‐based amorphous electrocatalysts, including amorphous metal phosphide and metal hydroxide electrocatalysts with remarkable HER and OER properties respectively, the utilization of single‐function HER or OER catalysts tends to augment system complexity for water electrolysis, thereby escalating the cost of hydrogen production. In this regard, amorphous HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts are desired. In this review, we summarize the recent development on transition metal‐based amorphous catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. The design strategies for constructing HER/OER bifunctional transition‐metal‐based amorphous electrocatalysts are highlighted here, also including the exploration of relationship between catalyst structures and their remarkably improved performance. Finally, the possibilities of amorphous bifunctional catalysts for practical industrial applications are evaluated and future research direction are suggested.

ABSTRACT Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) as power generators and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) as hydrogen fuel producers play critical roles in implementing hydrogen energy. The bipolar plates (BPPs) in both PEMFC and PEMWE facilitate the distribution of reactants and products, providing electrical connectivity in a series of singular cells. Although both systems are categorized under the same PEM spectrum, the differing reaction mechanisms require specialized plate properties to achieve optimum performance. This short review analyzes the characteristics of BPPs in both PEMFC and PEMWE, with a focus on the plate material, coating, and flow field. This short review concluded that the polymer composite graphite–based BPPs are the most feasible for PEMFC with no coating needed. PEMWE needs SS316 as a BPP material with a conductive coating to withstand the highly corrosive oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. The serpentine flow field showed dominance in PEMFC stack performance due to even fluid distribution and efficient liquid water drainage. However, its high‐pressure drop contributes to greater parasitic power. PEMWEs commonly adopt the parallel flow field for its lower contact resistance and bubble formation for efficient mass transport toward the cathode.

The endeavor to architect bifunctional electrocatalysts that exhibit both exceptional activity and durability heralds an era of boundless potential for the comprehensive electrolysis of seawater, an aspiration that, nevertheless, poses a substantial challenge. Within this work, we describe the precise engineering of a three-dimensional interconnected nanoparticle system named SCdoped Co2VO4/CoP (SCCo2VO4), achieved through a meticulously arranged hydrothermal treatment sequence followed by gas-phase carbonization and phosphorization. The resulting SCCo2VO4 electrode exhibits outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic stability, attributed to the strategic anionic doping and abundant heterogeneous interfaces. Doping not only adjusts the electronic structure, enhancing electron transfer efficiency but also optimizes the surface-active sites. This electrode prodigiously necessitated an extraordinarily minimal overpotential of merely 92 and 350 mV to attain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1 M KOH solution. Noteworthily, when integrated into an electrolyzer for the exhaustive splitting of seawater, the SCP-Co2VO4 manifested an exceptionally low cell voltage of 2.08 V@50 mA cm−2 and showcased a durability that eclipses that of most hitherto documented nickel-based bifunctional materials. Further elucidation through Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses underscored that anion doping and the inherent heterostructure adeptly optimize the Gibbs free energy of intermediates comprising hydrogen, chlorine, and oxygen (manifested as OH, O, OOH) within the HER and OER paradigms, thus propelling the electrochemical kinetics of seawater splitting to unprecedented velocities. These revelations unfurl a pioneering design philosophy for the creation of cost-effective yet superior catalysts aimed at the holistic division of water molecules, charting a course towards the realization of efficient and sustainable hydrogen production methodologies.

The sluggishness of the complementary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reckoned as one of the major drawbacks in developing an energy-efficient green hydrogen-producing electrolyzer. An array of organic molecule oxidation reactions, operational at a relatively low potential, have been explored as a substitute for the OER. Glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) has emerged as a leading alternative in this context. Additionally, the GOR generates several value-added organic compounds following oxidation that enhance the cost viability of the overall electrolysis reaction. In this study, a low-cost, room temperature operable, and energy-efficient synthetic methodology has been developed to generate unique two-dimensional CuO nanosheets (CuO NS). This CuO NS material was embedded on a carbon paper electrode, which showcased excellent glycerol electro-oxidation performance operational at a moderately low applied potential. Formic acid is the major product of this CuO NS-driven GOR (Faradaic efficiency ~80%), as it is formed primarily via the glyceraldehyde oxidation pathway. This CuO NS material was also active for oxidizing other abundant alcohols like ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, albeit at a relatively poor efficiency. Therefore, this robust CuO NS material has displayed the potential to be used in large-scale electrolyzers functioning with HER/GOR reactions.

Abstract Rapid synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) offers new opportunities to develop functional materials in widespread applications. Although some methods have successfully produced HEA NPs, these methods generally require rigorous conditions such as high pressure, high temperature, restricted atmosphere and limited substrates, which impede practical viability. In this work, we report a laser solid-phase synthesis of CrMnFeCoNi nanoparticles by laser irradiation of mixed metal precursors on a laser-induced graphene (LIG) support with a 3D porous structure. The CrMnFeCoNi nanoparticles are embraced by several graphene layers, forming graphene shell-encapsulated HEA nanoparticles. We provide an in-depth understanding of the laser solid-phase synthesis of HEA NPs on LIG supports by simulation and experimental observations, in consideration of mixed metal precursor adsorption, thermal decomposition, reduction through electrons from laser-induced thermionic emission, and liquid beads splitting. The production rate reaches up to 30 g/h under the current laser setup. The laser-synthesized graphene shell-encapsulated CrMnFeCoNi NPs loaded on LIG supports are used directly as 3D binder-free integrated electrodes and exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 293 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and exceptional stability over 428 hours in alkaline media, outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalyst and the counterpart catalysts reported by other methods. This work also demonstrates the versatility of this technique through the successful synthesis of CrMnFeCoNi oxide, sulfide and phosphide nanoparticles.

The production of H2 from renewable sources represents a crucial challenge for the planet’s future to achieve net zero emissions and store renewable energy. A possible alternative to water electrolysis (WE), which requires high potential (E > 1.48 V) to trigger the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), would be alcohol electrochemical reforming (ER), which implies the oxidation of short organic molecules such as methanol or ethanol. In ER, energy must be supplied to the system, but from a thermodynamic point of view, the energy request for the methanol or ethanol oxidation reaction is much lower than that of the OER. To study this process, an in-house 50 wt.% Pt1Ru1/C anodic catalyst was easily synthesized according to the Pt sulphite complex route and the impregnation of a carbon support (Ketjenblack, KB) and a Ru precursor. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the structure, composition, and morphology of the catalyst. It appears that two distinct crystallographic phases of the Pt and Ru nanoparticles were encountered after the synthesis conducted by Ru impregnation. For the electrochemical measurements, ethanol electrooxidation (2 M CH3CH2OH) was studied first in a half cell with a rotating disc electrode (RDE) configuration under acid conditions and then in a direct ethanol electroreforming (or electrolysis) cell, equipped with a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as the electrolyte. The output current density was 0.93 A cm−2 at 1 V and 90 °C in 2 M ethanol. The remarkable current densities obtained in the alcohol electrolyzer at a low voltage are better than the actual state of the art for PEM ethanol ER.

Abstract Due to the prevailing energy shortages, the quest for new alternative energy sources is growing increasingly urgent. Hydrogen production through water electrolysis has become a crucial method. However, the slow four-electron reaction in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) becomes the main rate-limiting step. In this study, we propose obtaining heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO-P after composite phosphatisation using nickel foam (NF) as the substrate material. The experimental results demonstrate that the heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO exhibits an overpotential of 365mV at a current density of 10mA/cm2 , and displays a Tafel slope value of 114.02mF/dec, a bilayer capacitance of 1.853mF/cm2 for OER in a 1 M KOH solution. After phosphating, the heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO-P exhibits exceptional catalytic performance with only 215 mV overpotential, a Tafel slope value of 79.36 mV/dec, and a bilayer capacitance of 34.73mF/cm2 at a current density of 10mA/cm2 . Moreover, it also exhibits relatively stable performance during cyclic voltammetry testing for up to1000 cycles. Analyses suggest that the formation of a heterojunction structure in La(OH)3@CuO-P effectively addresses the issues of insufficient conductivity of La(OH)3 and tendency for CuO monomer aggregation while maintaining excellent properties for each component. The substitutional P atom doping not only adjusts the electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption free energy of -OH but also reduces sample size and increases catalytic active sites, thereby further enhancing the OER performance of the material.

Abstract We investigate the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules (COMs) in turbulent disks using gas-ice chemical reaction network simulations. We trace trajectories of dust particles considering advection, turbulent diffusion, gas drag, and vertical settling, for 106 yrs in a protoplanetary disk. Then, we solve a gas-ice chemical reaction network along the trajectories and obtain the temporal evolution of molecular abundances. We find that the COM abundances in particles can differ by more than two orders of magnitude even when the UV fluence (i.e., the time integral of UV flux) received by the particles are similar, suggesting that not only the UV fluence but also the time variation of the UV flux does matter for the evolution of COMs in disks. The impact of UV fluence on molecular abundances differs between oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing COMs. While higher UV fluence results in oxygen being locked into CO2, leading to reduced abundances of oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH3OCH3, mild UV exposure can promote their formation by supplying the precursor radicals. On the other hand, nitrogen is not locked up into specific molecules, allowing the formation of nitrogen-bearing COMs, particularly CH3NH2, even for the particle that receives the higher UV fluence. We also find that the final COM abundances are mostly determined by the inherited abundances from the protostellar core when the UV fluence received by dust particles is less than a critical value, while they are set by both the inherited abundances and the chemistry inside the disk at higher UV fluence.

Abstract A geologically rapid Neoproterozoic oxygenation event is commonly linked to the appearance of marine animal groups in the fossil record. However, there is still debate about what evidence from the sedimentary geochemical record—if any—provides strong support for a persistent shift in surface oxygen immediately preceding the rise of animals. We present statistical learning analyses of a large dataset of geochemical data and associated geological context from the Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic sedimentary record and then use Earth system modelling to link trends in redox-sensitive trace metal and organic carbon concentrations to the oxygenation of Earth’s oceans and atmosphere. We do not find evidence for the wholesale oxygenation of Earth’s oceans in the late Neoproterozoic era. We do, however, reconstruct a moderate long-term increase in atmospheric oxygen and marine productivity. These changes to the Earth system would have increased dissolved oxygen and food supply in shallow-water habitats during the broad interval of geologic time in which the major animal groups first radiated. This approach provides some of the most direct evidence for potential physiological drivers of the Cambrian radiation, while highlighting the importance of later Palaeozoic oxygenation in the evolution of the modern Earth system.

Research findings can offer data and a theoretical framework for a quantitative examination of the bentonite dehydration mechanism. The reasons for changes in pore’ water under the influence of gamma rays in vacuum and in the presence of oxygen was discussed using TGA and DTA, FT-IR spectroscopy. It was revealed that dehydration and pore characteristics are mutually dependent. A question about the associated evolution of dehydration pore‘s water in nanostructured sodium – bentonite clay under the influence of ionizing rays with and without oxygen has been comparatively studied. The article is devoted to a discussion of how ionizing radiation, passing through nanoclays, produces, or rather begins to produce, chemical effects. It was used Infrared spectroscopy as the method for determining structural responses of natural clay from the Alpoid deposit in the Republic of Azerbaijan, to gamma rays exposure. It was found that under influence of ionizing rays in vacuum obtained hydrogen peroxide. It is of great interest for the study of the dehydration reaction mechanism and its role in formation of H2 under gamma irradiation.

The characteristics and stages of collapse–filling in paleo-underground rivers vary in recharge–runoff–discharge zones, constraining the associated fracture-caved reservoirs in carbonate strata. This paper comprehensively uses core, fluid inclusion, and carbon–oxygen isotope to probe the evolution process and migration of collapse–filling in paleo-underground rivers in the Northern Uplift of the Tarim Basin. The results show that 1) more than three stages of collapse–filling were identified in recharge–runoff–discharge zones, and a four-stage differential collapse–filling process was proposed to summarize the evolution of paleo-underground rivers. 2) The collapse–filling process varies spatiotemporally in the recharge, runoff, and discharge zones. Hydrodynamic strength and filling capacity migrate gradually from the recharge zone to the discharge zone. 3) Collapse–filling mechanisms, including gravity, suffusion, and suction–erosion mechanisms, also vary along with the collapse–filling evolution process of paleo-underground rivers. The research provided a new insight to recognize and interpret the differential planar distribution and vertical filling of the paleo-underground river system, which can be further applied to investigate the fracture-caved karst reservoirs.

Heavy meson production in reactions with nuclei is an active new frontier to understand QCD dynamics and the process of hadronization in nuclear matter. Measurements in various colliding systems at RHIC and LHC, including Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, O-O, p-Pb, and p-O, enable precision tests of the medium-size, temperature, and mass dependencies of the in-medium parton propagation and shower formation. We employ a coupled DGLAP evolution framework that takes advantage of splitting functions recently obtained in softcollinear effective theory with Glauber gluons (SCETG) and hard thermal loop (HTL) motivated collisional energy loss effects. With jet quenching effects constrained to the nuclear modification factor of charged hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV, we present predictions for light and heavy-meson in Xe-Xe, O-O and p-Pb collisions at the LHC.We find that the nuclear modification scales non-trivially with the quark mass and medium properties. In particular, there can be sizeable collision-induced attenuation of heavy mesons in small systems such as oxygen-oxygen and high-multiplicity p-Pb events. Finally, we analyze the impact of different models of initial-state parton dynamics on the search for QGP signatures in small colliding systems.

The Dalaku’an mafic–ultramafic intrusion, located in the western segment of the East Kunlun, presents conducive conditions for the magmatic Cu-Ni sulfide deposits. According to the detailed petrographic observation, the amphiboles within distinct rock types were analyzed by EPMA analysis. The crystallization conditions, such as temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and water content of the magma, were calculated to explore the genesis of the intrusion. The amphiboles were divided into three types: Amp-I, characterized by low silicon content but enrichment of aluminum, titanium, and alkali, predominantly comprising Tschermakitic hornblende and Magnesio-hornblende with mantle-derived traits; Amp-II, exhibiting elevated silicon content but diminished levels of aluminum, titanium, and alkali, primarily constituted of Magnesio-hornblende; whereas Amp-III manifests as Actinolitic hornblende, indicative of crustal origins. The calculated temperatures of amphiboles ranged between Amp-I (955–880) °C, Amp-II (852–774) °C, and Amp-III (761–760) °C; the pressures ranged between Amp-I (454–274) MPa, Amp-II (194–93) MPa, and Amp-III (101–84) MPa; the oxygen fugacities (△NNO) ranged between Amp-I (0.93–2.17), Amp-II (1.55–2.52), and Amp-III (1.89); and the water contents (H2Omelt) ranged from (6.69–8.67) to (5.90–7.32). The magma experienced multiple stages of crystallization and underwent complex magma evolution at different depths. The high oxygen fugacity and water content could be attributed to the subduction of the oceanic crust. The magma source of the Dalaku’an intrusion was metasomatized by fluids from subducting plates, thereby originating within a post-collision extension.

Abstract Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes to have evolved oxygenic photosynthesis paving the way for complex life. Studying the evolution and ecological niche of cyanobacteria and their ancestors is crucial for understanding the intricate dynamics of biosphere evolution. These organisms frequently deal with environmental stressors such as salinity and drought, and they employ compatible solutes as a mechanism to cope with these challenges. Compatible solutes are small molecules that help maintain cellular osmotic balance in high salinity environments, such as marine waters. Their production plays a crucial role in salt tolerance, which, in turn, influences habitat preference. Among the five known compatible solutes produced by cyanobacteria (sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, and glycine betaine), their synthesis varies between individual strains. In this study, we work in a Bayesian stochastic mapping framework, integrating multiple sources of information about compatible solute biosynthesis in order to predict the ancestral habitat preference of Cyanobacteria. Through extensive model selection analyses and statistical tests for correlation, we identify glucosylglycerol and glucosylglycerate as the most significantly correlated with habitat preference, while trehalose exhibits the weakest correlation. Additionally, glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, and glycine betaine show high loss/gain rate ratios, indicating their potential role in adaptability, while sucrose and trehalose are less likely to be lost due to their additional cellular functions. Contrary to previous findings, our analyses predict that the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria (living at around 3180 Ma) had a 97% probability of a high salinity habitat preference and was likely able to synthesise glucosylglycerol and glucosylglycerate. Nevertheless, cyanobacteria likely colonized low-salinity environments shortly after their origin, with an 89% probability of the first cyanobacterium with low-salinity habitat preference arising prior to the Great Oxygenation Event (2460 Ma). Stochastic mapping analyses provide evidence of cyanobacteria inhabiting early marine habitats, aiding in the interpretation of the geological record. Our age estimate of ~2590 Ma for the divergence of two major cyanobacterial clades (Macro- and Microcyanobacteria) suggests that these were likely significant contributors to primary productivity in marine habitats in the lead-up to the Great Oxygenation Event, and thus played a pivotal role in triggering the sudden increase in atmospheric oxygen.

Abstract Understanding the explosion mechanism and hydrodynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing quest in astronomy. The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution – with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the Prometheus-HotB code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code ExTraSS (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling – circumventing the difficulties of representing 56Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models – we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium. Lastly, we turn to the NIR spectra from our models to investigate the potential of using this regime to look for the presence of He in the nebular phase.

Abstract The use of solid-oxide materials in electrocatalysis applications, especially in hydrogen-evolution reactions, is promising. However, further improvements are warranted to overcome the fundamental bottlenecks to enhancing the performance of solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which is directly linked to the more-refined fundamental understanding of complex physical and chemical phenomena and mass exchanges that take place at the surfaces and in the bulk of electrocatalysis materials. Here, we developed an eReaxFF force field for barium zirconate doped with 20 mol% of yttrium, BaZr 0.8 Y 0.2 O 3-δ (BZY20) to enable a systematic, large-length-scale, and longer-timescale atomistic simulation of solid-oxide electrocatalysis for hydrogen generation. All parameters for the eReaxFF were optimized to reproduce quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations on relevant condensed phase and cluster systems describing oxygen vacancies, vacancy migrations, electron localization, water adsorption, water splitting, and hydrogen generation on the surfaces of the BZY20 solid oxide. Using the developed force field, we performed both zero-voltage (excess electrons absent) and non-zero-voltage (excess electrons present) molecular dynamics simulations to observe water adsorption, water splitting, proton migration, oxygen-vacancy migrations, and eventual hydrogen-production reactions. Based on investigations offered in the present study, we conclude that the eReaxFF force field-based approach can enable computationally efficient simulations for electron conductivity, electron leakage, and other non-zero-voltage effects on the solid oxide materials using the explicit-electron concept. Moreover, we demonstrate how the eReaxFF force field-based atomistic-simulation approach can enhance our understanding of processes in SOEC applications and potentially other renewable-energy applications.

Recycling of granite sludge has both economic and environmental benefits. In this paper, high glossiness self-glazed ceramics were prepared from granite sludge with the addition of TiO2, Ca(OH)2 and MgO by combining two-step sintering and low-temperature crystallization. The effect of MgO addition on the phase evolution, crystallization and properties of the glazed ceramics was studied to reveal its role in the diopside precipitation. With increasing MgO content, the reduced glass viscosity accelerates the dissolution of quartz and anorthite into the liquid glass phase, resulting in a decrease in flexural strength above 1% MgO. Meanwhile, the addition of MgO increases the non-bridging oxygen to lower the glass transition temperature. The increase in the Al/Si ratio of the glass phase and the mixed alkaline earth effect contribute to an increase in the crystallization temperature. After thermal treatment at 950 °C, the precipitated diopside increases the crystallinity of the glazed glass-ceramic from 6.4% to 19.3% at 3% MgO, resulting in a surface glossiness of 99.7 GU and a flexural strength of 64.1 MPa. High glossiness self-glazed ceramics with an aesthetic appearance could be used in decorative building tiles for scalable utilization of granite sludge.

Cancers evolve in a dynamic ecosystem. Thus, characterizing cancer's ecological dynamics is crucial to understanding cancer evolution and can lead to discovering novel biomarkers to predict disease progression. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an early-stage breast cancer characterized by abnormal epithelial cell growth confined within the milk ducts. Although there has been extensive research on genetic and epigenetic causes of breast carcinogenesis, none of these studies have successfully identified a biomarker for the progression and/or upstaging of DCIS. In this study, we show that ecological habitat analysis of hypoxia and acidosis biomarkers can significantly improve prediction of DCIS upstaging. First, we developed a novel eco-evolutionary designed approach to define habitats in the tumor intra-ductal microenvironment based on oxygen diffusion distance in our DCIS cohort of 84 patients. Then, we identify cancer cells with metabolic phenotypes attributed to their habitat conditions, such as the expression of CA9 indicating hypoxia responding phenotype, and LAMP2b indicating a hypoxia-induced acid adaptation. Traditionally these markers have shown limited predictive capabilities for DCIS upstaging, if any. However, when analyzed from an ecological perspective, their power to differentiate between indolent and upstaged DCIS increased significantly. Second, using eco-evolutionary guided computational and digital pathology techniques, we discovered distinct spatial patterns of these biomarkers and used the distribution of such patterns to predict patient upstaging. The patterns were characterized by both cellular features and spatial features. With a 5-fold validation on the biopsy cohort, we trained a random forest classifier to achieve the area under curve(AUC) of 0.74. Our results affirm the importance of using eco-evolutionary-designed approaches in biomarkers discovery studies in the era of digital pathology by demonstrating the role of eco-evolution dynamics in predicting cancer progression.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a cause of bronchial dilatation, associated with rheumatoid lung is rare. This is why we report a case with the aim of discussing the clinical, diagnostic characteristics and therapeutic possibilities of ciliary pathology and showing the link between it and rheumatoid arthritis. Observation: This is a 40-year-old African patient, married without children, from a consanguineous couple, with a family history of a brother who died in adulthood in a picture of respiratory failure and productive cough. She presented with recurrent rhinorrhea since childhood and bronchorrhea in a picture of progressively worsening dyspnea and clubbing. During the evolution of the disease, inflammatory polyarthralgia was associated. The ultrastructural ciliary study by electron microscopy and the measurement of nasal nitrogen oxide are the confirmatory examinations of primary ciliary dyskinesia. They are not achievable in our practice. However, based on the history and clinical findings, the patient presented several elements in favor of this pathology. additional investigations, notably the rheumatoid factor and the chest CT scan, allowed us to suggest rheumatoid lung. Our therapeutic conduct was the administration of antibiotic therapy, oxygen therapy, immunosuppressant, anti-inflammatory and the practice of respiratory physiotherapy. Conclusion: Primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with pulmonary involvement in rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of developing respiratory failure.

Abstract Glaucophytes, an enigmatic group of freshwater algae, occupy a pivotal position within the Archaeplastida, providing insights into the early evolutionary history of plastids and their host cells. These algae possess unique plastids, known as cyanelles that retain certain ancestral features, enabling a better understanding of the plastid transition from cyanobacteria. In this study, we investigated the role of ethylene, a potent hormone used by land plants to coordinate stress responses, in the glaucophyte alga Cyanophora paradoxa . We demonstrate that C. paradoxa produces gaseous ethylene when supplied with exogenous 1‐aminocyclopropane‐1‐carboxylic acid (ACC), the ethylene precursor in land plants. In addition, we show that cells produce ethylene natively in response to abiotic stress, and that another plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), interferes with ethylene synthesis from exogenously supplied ACC, while positively regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. ROS synthesis also occurred following abiotic stress and ACC treatment, possibly acting as a second messenger in stress responses. A physiological response of C. paradoxa to ACC treatment is growth inhibition. Using transcriptomics, we reveal that ACC treatment induces the upregulation of senescence‐associated proteases, consistent with the observation of growth inhibition. This is the first report of hormone usage in a glaucophyte alga, extending our understanding of hormone‐mediated stress response coordination into the Glaucophyta, with implications for the evolution of signaling modalities across Archaeplastida.

Abstract Ammonia fuel cells using carbon‐neutral ammonia as fuel are regarded as a fast, furious, and flexible next‐generation carbon‐free energy conversion technology, but it is limited by the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Platinum can efficiently drive these three types of reactions, but its scale‐up application is limited by its susceptibility to poisoning and high cost. In order to reduce the cost and alleviate poisoning, incorporating Pt with various metals proves to be an efficient and feasible strategy. Herein, PtFeCoNiIr/C trifunctional high‐entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts are prepared with uniform mixing and ultra‐small size of 2 ± 0.5 nm by Joule heating method. PtFeCoNiIr/C exhibits efficient performance in AOR ( J peak = 139.8 A g −1 PGM ), ORR ( E 1/2 = 0.87 V), and HER ( E 10 = 20.3 mV), outperforming the benchmark Pt/C, and no loss in HER performance at 100 mA cm −2 for 200 h. The almost unchanged E 1/2 in the anti‐poisoning test indicates its promising application in real fuel cells powered by ammonia. This work opens up a new path for the development of multi‐functional electrocatalysts and also makes a big leap toward the exploration of cost‐effective device configurations for novel fuel cells.

Abstract Recent advances are achieved in the design and development of efficient organic photosensitizers (PSs), especially with fluorescence imaging navigation in the second near‐infrared (NIR‐II, 1000–1700 nm) region. However, there are simply a handful of NIR‐II emissive organic PSs with efficient oxygen‐independent capability due to the scarcity of high‐performance NIR‐responsive organic materials and targeted delivery. Herein, a NIR‐II‐emissive organic nanomedicine with biomimetic engineering for high‐performance NIR‐II imaging and targeted multiple phototherapies of pancreatic tumors is reported. An A‐D‐A‐type conjugated small‐molecule TPC is designed and used to prepare water‐dispersive nanoparticles, which demonstrated high efficiency for type I and type II photodynamic performances, good photothermal conversion of 57%, and bright NIR‐II emission with a quantum yield of 9.8% under 808 nm light irradiation. With pancreatic cancer cell membrane camouflage, the biomimetic TPC nanomedicine achieved high‐resolution and targeted bioimaging of whole‐body blood vessels and tumors. Antitumor experiments demonstrated the high efficiency of the biomimetic TPC nanomedicine for pancreatic tumor elimination and good biosafety with 808 nm light irradiation. This work demonstrated a NIR‐II‐emissive versatile nanomedicine with enhanced tumor‐targeting for high‐resolution NIR‐II bioimaging and superior phototheranostics, providing a feasible idea for the evolution of targeted and high‐performance theranostics.

Seaweed functional traits provide insights on natural populations, their adaptations to the local environment, which can be utilized for commercial exploitation. Here, we analyzed the functional traits of Gracilaria dura from two intertidal populations in Veraval and Adri, from the coast of Gujarat, India, over a period of three months. Functional traits were measured by analyzing growth rates, respiration, primary production, antioxidant activity and the content of plant growth hormones. The weight-to-length allometric exponent ≈3 indicated that G. dura grew almost isometrically. Furthermore, frond shape was not significantly different. Fronds in Veraval, resting submerged, grew faster than the fronds in Adri, which, lay exposed in the flat bare rock during low tide. Accordingly, the simultaneous increase in antioxidant activity, O 2 production and chlorophyll content in fronds from Adri suggests that stress from desiccation and UV led to the detrimental accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species, leading to decreased growth and decreased production of growth hormones. The increased Chl-a may indicate enhanced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) for the dissipation of excess absorbed light. These results aid in establishing the best practices for maximizing biomass yield or the yield of specific molecules. For maximized biomass yield, fronds should not be subject to emersion nor cultivated on the sea-surface. On the other hand, fronds grown subject to emersion or at the sea-surface yield less biomass but more content on molecules such as antioxidants (flavonoids, phenolics, enzymes), that fight stress from desiccation high temperatures and UV. In this case, stress should still be avoided during the initial growth, at the onset of the growth season, in order to not disrupt the production of growth hormones. The increased O 2 production at Adri was initially mistakenly perceived as enhanced Net Primary Production. Only a posterior holistic perspective over the whole data allowed to conclude that it was likely the stress-induced detrimental accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species. More robust experiments are required to establish if the differences observed between locations have led to the evolution of genetic strains specific to each habitat that may show different performances and yields when cultivated in similar environments.

ABSTRACT Current investigations into the Albian–Cenomanian sedimentary record within the Western Interior have identified multiple complex tectono‐sedimentary process–response systems during the ongoing evolution of North America. One key sedimentary succession, the upper Cedar Mountain Formation (Short Canyon Member and Mussentuchit Member), has historically been linked to various regionally and continentally significant tectonic events, including Sevier fold‐and‐thrust deformation. However, the linkage between the Short Canyon Member and active Sevier tectonism has been unclear due to a lack of high‐precision age constraints. To establish temporal context, this study compares maximum depositional ages from detrital zircons recovered from the Short Canyon Member with that of a modified Bayesian age stratigraphic model (top‐down) to infer that the Short Canyon Member was deposited at ca 100 Ma, penecontemporaneous with rejuvenated thrusting across Utah [Pavant (Pahvant), Iron Springs and Nebo thrusts]. These also indicate a short depositional hiatus with the lowermost portion of the overlying Mussentuchit Member. The Short Canyon Member and Mussentuchit Member preserve markedly different sedimentary successions, with the Short Canyon Member interpreted to be composed of para‐autochthonous orogen–transverse (across the Sevier highlands) clastics deposited within a series of stacked distributive fluvial fans. Meanwhile, the muddy paralic Mussentuchit Member was a mix of orogen–transverse (Sevier highlands and Cordilleran Arc) and orogen–parallel basinal sediments and suspension settling fines within the developing collisional foredeep. However, the informally named last chance sandstone (middle sandstone of the Mussentuchit Member) is identified as an orogen–transverse sandy debris flow originating from the Sevier highlands, similar to the underlying Short Canyon Member. During this phase of landscape evolution, the Short Canyon Member – Mussentuchit Member depocentre was a sedimentary conduit system that would fertilize the Western Interior Seaway with ash‐rich sediments. These volcaniclastic contributions, along with penecontemporaneous deposits across the western coastal margin of the Western Interior Seaway, eventually would have lowered oxygen content and resulted in a contributing antecedent trigger for the Cenomanian–Turonian transition Oceanic Anoxic Event 2.

Abstract Skin lesions, including skin bacterial abscesses, have become one of the most important health challenges and usually need systemic high‐dose antibiotics. Therefore, it is of particular importance to develop novel approaches for treating this ever‐growing challenge to human health. To address this challenge, herein a copper nanostructure is developed giving combined photothermal and chemodynamic therapies for focal infection treatment. The Cu‐based nanostructures with intrinsic catalytic properties are prepared by D‐L or L cysteine (Cys) as ligand and copper ions. It is shown that the multifunctional copper‐Cys (Cu‐Cys) nanostructures can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and they exhibit near infrared (NIR)‐enhanced catalytic activities to improve ROS production for highly efficient eradication of bacteria. Moreover, the results proved O 2 evolution property of the Cu‐Cys nanoparticles (NPs). The nanostructures show shape‐dependent antibacterial activity where DL‐Cu‐Cys NPs show higher bactericidal performance than L‐Cu‐Cys NPs. In vitro results demonstrate that 2.5 and 1.25 µg mL −1 of DL‐Cu‐Cys NPs is enough to achieve rapid killing of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) or Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) respectively under 808 nm light irradiation in 10 min. This work introduces a unique photoactive nanoagent to efficiently treat subcutaneous abscess by combining NIR light‐triggered photothermal effect and catalytic generation of ROS without using any antibiotic.

Morocco is one of the main countries affected in North African with the scorpion envenomations. Faced with the threat, significant morbidity and a major risk of death especially in children, a detailed identification of scorpionic profile of stings remains important for health authorities at national or even regional level. The current study aims to establish the epidemiological, clinical, biological and evolutionary data of the scorpionism by analyzing 383 cases of scorpion stings in children from three age groups (< 1 year, 1-5 years and > 5 years), admitted at the Regional Hospital Hassan II-Agadir in the Souss Massa region during the period of 9 years and 10 months from January 2013 to October 2022. Our results showed that patients under 1 year of age presented the most severe cases and had the highest mortality rate. However, the clinical signs and symptoms observed illustrated severe damages to vital systems, particularly the cardiovascular, neurological and pulmonary systems, although the signs associated with the latter were present only in cases admitted in grades 2 and 3 for the three age categories studied. Fluctuations in vital constants (temperature and peripheral oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate), biochemical parameters (ASAT, ALAT, urea and blood creatine, as well as blood sugar) and CBC results revealed major functional disturbances in vital organs, especially in envenomated cases admitted in grade 3. A positive correlation was mentioned between the state of evolution and the various epidemiological parameters, digestive symptoms, as well as signs and symptoms linked to hemodynamic state, general and neurological state. The main interest is to illustrate the seriousness of scorpion envenomations, especially in the high-risk population, for whom an improved therapeutic approach in health centers will undoubtedly be reinforced, and the admission of immunotherapy, as a fundamental part of the treatment, remains important.

The combustion of hydrogen and carbon-monoxide mixtures, so-called syngas, plays an increasingly important role in the safety context of non-fossil energy generation, more specifically in the risk management of incidents in process engineering plants for ammonia synthesis and in nuclear power plants. In order to characterize and simulate syngas/air combustion on industrially relevant scales, subgrid modelling is required, which is often based on a reaction progress variable. To understand the influence of different fuel compositions, turbulence intensities and flame topologies on different possible definitions of reaction progress variable, detailed chemistry direct numerical simulations data of premixed, lean hydrogen/air and syngas/air flames has been considered. A reaction progress variable based on normalized molecular oxygen mass fraction has been found not to capture the augmentation of the normalized burning rate per unit flame surface area in comparison to the corresponding 1D unstretched premixed flame due to preferential diffusion effects. By contrast, reaction progress variables based on other individual species, such as hydrogen, can capture the augmentation of the rate of burning well, but exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to preferential diffusion effects, especially in response to flame curvatures. However, a reaction progress variable based on the linear combination of the main products can accurately represent the temperature evolution of the flame for different mixtures, turbulence intensities and varying local flame topology, while effectively capturing the augmentation of burning rate due to preferential diffusion effects. However, its tendency to assume values larger than 1.0 in the regions of super-adiabatic temperatures poses challenges for future modeling approaches, whereas the reaction progress variable based on hydrogen mass fraction remains bound between 0.0 and 1.0 despite showing deviations in comparison to corresponding variations obtained from the unstretched laminar flame depending on flame curvature variations.

On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio > 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars' mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.

Abstract. The global spread of lake hypoxia, [O2] < 2 mg/l, during the last two centuries has a severe impact on ecological systems and sedimentation processes. While the occurance of hypoxia was observed in many lakes, a detailed quantification of hypoxia spread remained largely unquantified. We track the evolution of hypoxia and its controls during the past 200 yrs in lake Tiefer See (TSK; NE Germany) using 17 gravity cores, recovered between 10 and 62 m water depth in combination with lake monitoring data. Lake hypoxia was associated by the onset of varve preservation in the TSK, and has been dated by varve counting to 1918±1 at 62 m water depth and reached a lake-floor depth of 16 m at 1997±1. This indicates oxygen concentration to fell below the threshold for varve preservation at the lakefloor (>16 m). Sediment cores at 10–12 m depth do not contain varves indicating well oxygenation of the upper water column. Monitoring data show that the threshold for hypoxia at the depocenter is a period of five months of [O2] < 5 mgl   and two months of [O2] < 2 mgl . Detailed TOC, δ13Corg and XRF core scanning analyses of the short cores indicate that the depletion in DO started several decades prior to the varve preservation. This proves a change in the depositional conditions in the lake following a transition phase of several decades during which varve preservation was not accomplished. Furthermore, varve preservation does occur at seasonal stratification and not necessarily requires permanent stratification.

With the rapid development of industrialization, the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) has become a global environmental issue. Uranium is the primary fuel used in nuclear power generation. However, the production of uranium, typically based on the uranyl nitrate method, usually generates large amounts of nitrogen oxides, particularly NO2, with concentrations in the exhaust gas exceeding 10,000 ppm. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide are also produced during silver electrolysis processing and the treatment of waste electrolyte solutions. Traditional V-W/TiO2 NH3-SCR catalysts typically exhibit high catalytic activity at temperatures ranging from 300 to 400 °C, under conditions of low NOx concentrations and high gas hourly space velocity. However, their performance is not satisfying when reducing high concentrations of NO2. This study aims to optimize the traditional V-W/TiO2 catalysts to enhance their catalytic activity under conditions of high NO2 concentrations (10,000 ppm) and a wide temperature range (200–400 °C). On the basis of 3 wt% Mo/TiO2, various loadings of V2O5 were selected, and their catalytic activities were tested. Subsequently, the optimal ratios of active component vanadium and additive molybdenum were explored. Simultaneously, doping with WO3 for modification was selected in the V-Mo/TiO2 catalyst, followed by activity testing under the same conditions. The results show that: the NOx conversion rates of all five catalysts increase with temperature at range of 200–400 °C. Excessive loading of MoO3 decreased the catalytic performance, with 5 wt% being the optimal loading. The addition of WO3 significantly enhanced the low-temperature activity of the catalysts. When the loadings of WO3 and MoO3 were both 3 wt%, the catalyst exhibited the best denitrification performance, achieving a NOx conversion rate of 98.8% at 250 °C. This catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic activity in reducing very high concentration (10,000 ppm) NO2, at a wider temperature range, expanding the temperature range by 50% compared to conventional SCR catalysts. Characterization techniques including BET, XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD were employed to further study the evolution of the catalyst, and the promotional mechanisms are explored. The results revealed that the proportion of chemisorbed oxygen (Oα) increased in the WO3-modified catalyst, exhibiting lower V reduction temperatures, which are favorable for low-temperature denitrification activity. NH3-TPD experiments showed that compared to MoOx species, surface WOx species could provide more acidic sites, resulting in stronger surface acidity of the catalyst.

Modern life is connected. Our computers, phones, and watches are all tapped into personal insights, from a daily planner to keep track of meetings and appointments to a health monitor tracking everything from heart rate to blood oxygen level in real time. This connectivity has bled over into many different facets of our lives, including work. Business and industry maintain critical connections allowing for simplification of complex tasks and the monitoring of machines for safety and performance. As the oil field has become more connected, increasing opportunities for automation have been introduced into both new and existing oilfield technologies with aims to achieve new levels of productivity and safety. Whether it is a robotic arm on the drill floor of a rig bringing pipe from the stand to the well or autonomous robots being used for inspections and other operation observations in hard-to-reach or remote places, if the connectivity is there it opens the door to a vast, new toolkit for contractors and operators alike. In 2023, a group of contractors came together to help define the next steps in automation for floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels. The FPSO Coalition—made up of SLB, Rockwell Automation, Sensia, and Cognite—is a collaboration designed to accelerate the evolution of FPSOs by developing and employing new digital capabilities aimed at improving the reliability, availability, safety, and efficiency of the assets, while lowering the carbon footprint of their offshore operations. FPSOs have been invaluable tools for offshore development around the world for decades. Some older hardware does not have the benefit of being wired for connection or pieces of equipment being Internet of Things (IoT)-ready. As much as the coalition looks to solutions to integrate into new facilities, it also explores the limitations and potential for bringing older yet still viable components into the digital age. Under the venture, SLB was tapped to bring advanced digital solutions, subsurface domain expertise, and complex integration and project management capabilities to scale up efficiencies and lower the carbon footprint of operations across every stage of the FPSO life cycle. Rockwell would provide expertise in control and safety systems for FPSOs, as well as extensive experience in power systems. “Keeping in mind that the typical operating life of an FPSO can be 20-25-30 years, a lot can change in terms of technology, process conditions, regulatory requirements, etc.,” said Greg Trostel, global industry development manager for floating production at Rockwell Automation. “But ultimately, the main goal of automation is to ensure the reliable and safe operation of the vessel—no loss of containment, no personnel at risk, no environmental incidents. “Ideally, automation systems can adapt and grow with the changing technology and changing requirements. We depend on the automation systems to keep all the individual process modules connected to, and operating in concert with, the main vessel systems,” he said. One of the first things tasked to the coalition was a contract awarded to SLB for a multipurpose dynamic simulation solution providing an immersive digital twin environment to dynamically simulate operational processes and their control and automation systems, train personnel, and strengthen safety elements at five newbuild FPSO units to be installed in Búzios Field in the Santos Basin for Petrobras.
