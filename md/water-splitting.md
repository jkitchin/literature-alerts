Abstract Oxygen‐inducing controllable surface reconstruction on the transition metal‐based (TMB) materials surface has a great impact on catalytic performance. However, regulating the oxygen coordinative position during the active sites reconstructive process is challenging and poorly understood. Here, the metastable isomeric catalytic site is reasonably designed and fabricated for enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Due to the controlled coordinative position of the oxygen atom, a new ternary catalytic site Co‐P(‐‐O) is created, improving the photocatalytic performance of H 2 evolution toward 20.7 mmol g −1 in 6 h and 0.56% apparent quantum efficiency. The reconstruction method not only changes the electronic state around the catalytic site but also tunes the adsorption energy of the hydrogen atom. Compared with Co‐Co, Co‐P, Co‐O, and O‐Co‐P catalytic sites, the remarkable Co‐P(‐‐O) sites would drive the H‐atom connecting with the Co‐P bridge style achieving the best performance and excellent stability. Such a reconstructed catalytic site is also proved efficient in electrocatalysis and photo‐electrocatalysis systems. In conclusion, this work provides a new insight that the controllable isomeric catalytic site reconstruction strategy can dramatically enhance the catalytic performance.

Abstract Li–O 2 batteries deliver ultrahigh theoretical specific energy while suffering from low energy efficiency and poor cyclability due to sluggish kinetics of oxygen electrode reactions. Herein, a strategy of engineering interfacial electron structure of MXene‐based composites is presented to boost oxygen electrode reactions for advancing Li–O 2 batteries with the cation vacancy‐rich CoSe@MXene (V Co ‐CoSe 2 @MXene) as the case study. The formation of interfacial Co─C bond between V Co ‐CoSe 2 and Ti 3 C 2 MXene and its enhanced covalency after introducing Co vacancy leads to promoted electron transfer from Ti 3 C 2 MXene to CoSe 2 and optimized electronic structure of interfacial Co sites, especially the second Co sites neighboring Co vacancy, which serve as the active centers for oxygen redox reactions. On this basis, V Co ‐CoSe 2 @MXene‐based Li─O 2 batteries exhibit low overpotential (0.35 V) and excellent cycling stability (250 cycles at 500 mA g −1 ). This work proposes an effective strategy to develop MXene‐based electrocatalysts for Li–O 2 batteries by tailoring interfacial electron structure.

Abstract The development of cost‐effective and high‐performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is a significant challenge. This study presents the synthesis of binder‐free NiFe@NiFe layered double hydroxide (NNF) via one‐pot electrodeposition on carbon paper and Ni foam at high current densities. The presence of Ni sulfate residues on the prepared NNF is also investigated. The findings indicate that Ni sulfate significantly improves OER performance and durability. The sulfate content can be controlled by varying the method and duration of washing. NNF prepared through dipping (NNF‐D) exhibits outstanding OER activity with a low overpotential of 241 mV, which is 25 mV lower than that of NNF washed for 60 s (NNF‐W‐60 s) at 10 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH. Furthermore, density functional theory analyses indicate that the Ni sulfate residue helps modify the electronic structure, thereby optimizing the binding strength of *OOH. This synthetic strategy is expected to inspire the development of next‐generation catalysts utilizing various adsorbates.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a well-known gas-involved reaction in which oxygen bubbles are formed and adhered on anode surface to lead to a sharp decline of performance. Iridium oxide (IrO2) is the catalyst for water oxidation and is often used as a benchmark material. However, the factors affecting the bubbles detachment of IrO2 are still unclear. Herein, we found that: 1. Nafion®, one of the main components of PEM membrane and usually used as electrode binder, can significantly increase the hydrophobicity of the electrode surface and is unfavorable to bubble detachment. 2. IrO2 itself has good hydrophilicity but is not enough for efficient bubble separation, and no obvious linear relationship between bubble detachment performance and the particle size. 3. For improving bubble separation, irregularly rough surfaces should be avoided to prevent cavities trapping effect and multiple unnecessary bubble adhesion sites, both of which play the roles in stabilizing bubbles. In contrast, the uniformity and regularity of electrode surface should be paid more attention, as evidenced by comparing the surface morphology between drop-casting and pyrolysis in IrO2 and RuO2.

Electrochemical water splitting is widely recognized as an economical and sustainable method for producing high-purity hydrogen using renewable energy sources. Herein, we prepared 3D urchin-like sphere structures of Co3O4 to serve as an excellent bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. Different Co3O4 samples were directly synthesized on Ni foam through hydrothermal and annealing processes under various atmospheric conditions, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies with varying concentrations. Specifically, the Co3O4/NF-Ar/O2 demonstrates outstanding catalytic performance for both OER (η20 = 269 mV) and HER (η10 = 135 mV), while maintaining excellent durability in 1 M KOH. Electrolysis cells employing Co3O4/NF-Ar/O2 as both anode and cathode demonstrate a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to achieve 10 mV cm−2 in alkaline conditions. The excellent catalytic performance can be mainly attributed to the urchin-like nanostructure and the appropriate concentration of oxygen vacancies. This research provides further insights into the application of the method to induce oxygen vacancies in low-cost and high-efficiency transition metal oxides (TMOs)-based catalysts for electrochemical reaction.

Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in accelerating electrochemical water splitting green energy conversion systems. Herein, the dual strategy of incorporating oxygen vacancy and engineering heterointerface was employed for constructing N-doping graphene tubes (N-GTs) supported Ni3Fe/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with abundant oxygen vacancies (Ni3Fe/NiFe2O4 @N-GTs). Benefit from accelerating reaction kinetics and optimizing adsorption strength for reaction intermediates resulting from the synergistic effect of vacancies introduction and heterointerface formation, the optimized Ni3Fe/NiFe2O4 @N-GTs catalyst exhibits remarkably enhanced OER performance with an overpotential of 230 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a low Tafel slope of 33 mV dec−1 and 330 h stability at the high current density of 100 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, the full water splitting cell consisting of the Ni3Fe/NiFe2O4 @N-GTs-350 anode and a Pt/C cathode delivers a low cell voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm−2 and presents excellent durability for over 330 h of continuous operation at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, demonstrating it promising electrocatalyst for potential applications in the hydrogen production field.

Water electrolysis for hydrogen production has attracted significant scientific interest because it is sustainable, pure, and environmentally benign. Nevertheless, the slow rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during electrolytic water splitting greatly impedes the progress of its development, leading to higher energy consumption and higher costs during hydrogen production. Herein, Fe-doped NiMoO4 nanoflower clusters on nickel foam (Fe-NiMoO4-clusters/NF) as a superior electrocatalyst for the OER via a facile hydrothermal synthesis method. The material delivers excellent electrocatalytic performance at optimal Fe doping level (4%) with low overpotentials of 170 mV@10 mA cm−2 and 240 mV@100 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope, and long-term stability. Remarkably, the overall water splitting system assembled with the designed material and NiMoO4-clusters/NF exhibits superior stability and a low driving voltage. A comprehensive analysis indicates that Fe doping is crucial to the structure and electrocatalytic properties of NiMoO4. Fe-doped NiMoO4-clusters can serve as stable and efficient OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is a critical half-reaction that hinders water decomposition due to its sluggish kinetics. Developing efficient, stable electrocatalysts for OER is crucial for addressing the challenges in energy crisis and green hydrogen production. Compared to single-metal Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), synergistic interactions between metal ions in bimetallic MOFs provide sufficient space for tuning the electronic structure and oxygen-containing intermediate adsorption energies, and therefore bimetallic MOFs shows great potential in enhancing the OER kinetics. In this work, NiFe-MIL-88A nanosheets were synthesized on nickel foam via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The catalyst exhibited exceptional OER performance in 1.0 M KOH solution. Notably, it achieved a current density of 50 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 220 mV and displayed a Tafel slope of 43.2 mV/dec. Furthermore, it had impressive electrocatalytic durability suitable for commercial applications. This work elucidates the performance enhancement of NiFe bimetallic MOF from the perspective of electron migration. In-situ Raman spectroscopy was adopted to investigate the structural reconfiguration of the catalyst to reveal the true catalytic active sites. First-principle calculation demonstrate that introduction of Ni atoms with low electronegativity is conducive to optimizing the catalytic d-band center and ƒe value. This work provides insights for the designing bimetallic MOFs with superior OER performance.

H2 produced through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a shining star in the field of clean energy. Significant efforts have been dedicated to develop efficient and stable electrocatalysts to reduce the energy barrier and accelerate the kinetics of Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under various environments. Herein, we propose a strategy to accelerate the kinetics of HER under acid and alkaline environments by combining heterostructure engineering with defect engineering. We have successfully synthesized a series of WS2/WO3-x heterostructured catalysts, accompanied with substantial oxygen vacancies using a two-step synthesis method. With the partially sulfurization of WO3-x, the heterojunction interface of WS2 and WO3-x was formed along with the appearance of oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the migration of electrons. The heterostructured catalyst enriched with oxygen vacancies (defined as WS2/WO3-x-2) demonstrates superior HER performance in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the WS2/WO3-x-2 heterostructured catalyst manifests an overpotential of 120 mV in the acidic electrolytes and a slightly higher overpotential of 150 mV in an alkaline environment. The overpotentials offer an improvement compared to reported W-based catalysts in terms of HER performance. This work provides guiding significance on the design of heterostructured catalysts with promising performance for HER in acidic and alkaline environments.

Abstract In this paper, we report synthesis of novel nanoparticle catalyst of iridium oxide supported on conjugated polymer along with evaluation of activity and durability for oxygen evolution reaction. The IrO2/poly(BIAN-thiophene)/TNT catalyst was prepared from iridium complex and poly(BIAN-thiophene)/TNT by hydrothermal method. The synthesized IrO2/poly(BIAN-thiophene)/TNT catalysts was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transfer-infrared spectroscopy, ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. The average particle size of the IrO2 particles on poly(BIAN-thiophene)/TNT was 2.5 nm. The XPS measurement revealed that Ir complex was completely converted to iridium oxide through hydrothermal treatment. The IrO2/poly(BIAN-thiophene)/TNT catalyst showed sufficient performance for OER activity and durability in acidic condition. Our results indicate that IrO2/poly(BIAN-thiophene)/TNT is one of the prospective candidate catalysts for water splitting.

Designing a stable and highly active catalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) is essential for the industrialization of hydrogen energy but remains a major challenge. This work reports a simple approach to fabricating coupled Co2P/Fe2P nanorod array catalyst for overall water decomposition, demonstrating the source of excellent activity in the catalytic process. Under alkaline conditions, Co2P/Fe2P heterostructures exhibit an overpotential of 96 and 220 mV for HER and OER, respectively, at 10 mA cm–2. For total water splitting, a low voltage of 1.56 V is required to provide a current density of 10 mA cm–2. And the catalyst exhibits long-term durability for 30 h at a high current density of 250 mA cm–2. The analysis of the results revealed that the presence of interfacial oxygen vacancies and the strong interaction between Co2P/Fe2P provided the catalyst with more electrochemically active sites and a faster charge transfer capability, which improved the hydrolysis dissociation process. Electrochemically active metal (oxygen) hydroxide phases were produced after OER stability testing. The results of this study prove its great potential in practical industrial electrolysis and provide a reasonable and feasible strategy for the design of nonprecious metal phosphide electrocatalysts.

Rational construction of efficient and robust bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is key but challenging for the widespread application of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, bifunctional ligand Co metal–organic frameworks were first explored to fabricate a hybrid of heterostructured CoOx/Co nanoparticles anchored on a carbon substrate rich in CoNx sites (CoOx/Co@CoNC) via a one-step pyrolysis method. Such a unique heterostructure provides abundant CoNx and CoOx/Co active sites to drive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Besides, their positive synergies facilitate electron transfer and optimize charge/mass transportation. Consequently, the obtained CoOx/Co@CoNC exhibits a superior ORR activity with a higher half-wave potential of 0.88 V than Pt/C (0.83 V vs. RHE), and a comparable OER performance with an overpotential of 346 mV at 10 mA cm−2 to the commercial RuO2. The assembled ZAB using CoOx/Co@CoNC as a cathode catalyst displays a maximum power density of 168.4 mW cm−2, and excellent charge–discharge cyclability over 250 h at 5 mA cm−2. This work highlights the great potential of heterostructures in oxygen electrocatalysis and provides a new pathway for designing efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts toward rechargeable ZABs.

Abstract Electrocatalyst degradation, often caused by oxidative processes, forms a large barrier for the wide-spread application of electrolysers and fuel cells, which are crucial for a sustainable energy society. A detailed understanding of the catalyst surface structure under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions is, therefore, required to design more stable catalysts. Here, we study the oxidation of a Pt(111) model electrode under operando conditions combining High-Energy Surface X-ray Diffraction (HE-SXRD) with a Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) in a unique experimental setup. This novel approach allows us to follow the atomic structure of the electrode/electrolyte interface under oxygen evolution reaction conditions under hitherto unexplored potential regimes. We find that the Pt(111) surface gets electro-oxidized in a layer-by-layer fashion, which is the best scenario in terms of electrode stability. From ex situ X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements we find that a sub-nm thick, PtO 2 oxide film is forming, which deactivates the surface and leads to surface roughening after subsequent dissolution. Our results provide important insight for the operation of fuel cells and electrolysers under intermittent conditions of renewable energies.

Transition metal hydr(oxy)oxides (TMHs) are considered efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Toward identification of potential descriptors to circumvent the scaling relation limit for the OER, first-principles calculations were used to quantify the effects on the overpotential of different s (Mg), p (Al), and d (Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Sc, and Zn) electron dopants in Ni-based TMHs. Both the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) were examined. The results demonstrate that the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (EVO) is strongly affected by the chemical nature of the dopants. A linear relationship is identified between EVO and the free energy difference for the oxygen–oxygen coupling. A descriptor could be employed to discriminate whether the LOM is energetically favored over the AEM. These findings fill existing gaps in appropriate yet computationally light descriptors for direct identification between the AEM and LOM.

Copper phosphides are promising materials for energy conversion applications because of their unique electronic structure and controllable composition. Two stoichiometric copper phosphides, CuP2 and Cu3P, were prepared by direct wet-chemical synthesis using red phosphorus. They were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The precursor selection, reaction temperature, time and solvent composition were also studied. CuP2 is the thermodynamically more stable product, but Cu3P is more commonly obtained. This work demonstrated that higher temperature helps in CuP2 formation. More importantly, using more trioctylphosphine oxide helps control the morphology leading to crystal growth along the crystallographic a-axis. CuP2 and Cu3P were tested for hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions. CuP2 works better for HER in acidic conditions and OER in general, and Cu3P showed better activity than CuP2 for HER and ORR in an alkaline medium. This study has led to a simple approach to the synthesis of CuP2 nanowires.

The fast leaching of the Fe catalytic center and low conductivity of FeOOH have hindered the optimal stability and activity of Fe-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Here, Zn2+ is introduced into FeOOH with a looser nanosheet structure by regulating electric double layer (EDL) repulsion during electrodeposition. Meanwhile, as strong Lewis acids, Zn2+ in ZnxFeOOH could act as an electron acceptor, accepting electrons from FeOOH. The doping of Zn2+ shortens the bond length of Fe-O and enhances the covalency of Fe-O to improve electron transport rate and stability. The faster catalytic kinetics also been obtained by facilitating O* to form OOH* intermediates. At 100 mA cm−2, Zn0.5FeOOH requires overpotential of only 250 mV and maintains initial activity in 1 M KOH after 120 h. Notably, Zn-induced self-healing is achieved when the leaching and redeposition of Fe reach dynamic equilibrium. In 1 M KOH seawater, Zn0.5FeOOH requires overpotentials of 286 mV to produce current density of 100 mA cm−2. At 2.0 V, Zn0.5FeOOH can achieve 1000 mA cm−2 in anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer at room temperature. This work provides an effective Zn-induced strategy for designing efficient and stable OER catalysts for industrial development.

Recently, surface reconstruction derived from Ir-based derivatives could achieve satisfactory oxygen evolution performance. Herein, ultra-long nanowire hollandite structured Rb0.17IrO2 was synthesized and a nano-amorphous layer with a thickness of ∼1.5 nm was achieved by interfacial oxidation treatment. The prepared catalyst exhibits outstanding water oxidation activity with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 330 mV for robust continuous operation in acidic media. Through the spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the nano-amorphous layers induced by interfacial oxidation on the one-dimensional (1D)-nanowire surface have enhanced O-2p centers and increased Ir-O hybridization compared to the bulk Rb0.17IrO2 phase, which essentially balances the adsorption energy of the intermediates. Effectively incorporating surface reconstruction behavior could significantly improve catalyst activity. This work effectively combines 1D Ir-based materials and surface reconstruction, which provides a strategy for the subsequent full utilization of Ir-based materials applied on OER process.

Surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts is an effective strategy to modulate the space charge distribution to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. The p-n heterostructured FeP/CoP-2D octagonal nanoplates were successfully constructed by cation-exchange method. The space charge effect caused by the p-n heterojunction accelerated the electron transfer, optimized the electronic structure, and improved the activity of the active sites during the oxygen evolution reaction process. As a result, FeP/CoP-2D required only 247 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope as low as 68 mV dec-1. Density-functional theory calculations confirmed that the construction of p-n heterojunctions can enhance the adsorption of *OH in the active centers and optimize the Gibbs free energy of the OER reaction. This study provides an effective and feasible strategy for constructing p-n heterojunctions to modulate the space charge state for optimizing the OER performance of electrocatalysts.

The effects of vertical Lorentz forces generated by an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the inherent electric field on the oxygen evolution reaction conducted on a Ni wire are investigated using cyclic voltammetry, impedance measurements, and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Both downward and upward Lorentz forces provide smaller overpotentials than that generated in their absence. Based on a dual-bubble layer model for reactant transfer, we find that the diffusion resistance of the hydroxide ions and increased ohmic resistance (after iR correction) induced by the layer of bubbles attached to the electrode surface are most effectively alleviated by the downward Lorentz force, while the charge-transfer resistance is retained. Furthermore, the generated bubbles have smaller average diameters. By using PIV measurements, we find that stronger shear stresses induced by the faster flow of the electrolyte in the vicinity of the working electrode facilitate the detachment of bubbles from the electrode surface.

Hydrogen energy as the alternative to fossil fuel received wide attention. Among different methods of hydrogen production, water electrolysis is the cleanest and most promising method. However, its development is greatly limited by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop low-cost, high activity, and good stability of non-precious metal catalyst to replace the precious metal catalyst (Pt, RuO2), and to further reduce overpotential and power consumption. To date, great efforts have been made to develop transition metal compounds with electrocatalytic performance, such as sulfides, oxides, and carbides materials. Especially, transition metal sulfides play a very important role as catalysts and have attracted wide attention for their structural adjustability, high abundance, and mild preparation process. In this introduction, we focus on the role of transition metal sulfides in catalysts for water electrolysis, especially in a few most studied sulfides such as cobalt/molybdenum based sulfides and the recently reported homogeneous cobalt-molybdenum based sulfides, in which cobalt acts as a key element. Composition, morphology, and size are the most important factors that influence the intrinsic activity, electrical conductivity, and electronic structure of these transition metal sulfides. Besides, the effect of carbon nanomaterials as carrier materials is also discussed. The aim of this review is to emphasize the great potentials of cobalt and molybdenum based sulfides with high performance, and to help improve the performance of existing sulfides and explore new modification methods.

The development of a high-performance, cost-effective, and durable multifunctional semiconductor is crucial for clean energy and environmental remediation applications such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and photocatalysts. In this research, we have developed a hollow sphere-based spinel-structured CoCr2O4 (HS.CCO) for bi-functional applications. These hollow spheres exhibit excellent electrocatalytic OER performance under an alkaline (1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH)) medium, which displays a higher electrocatalytic ability. The spinel hollow spheres demonstrate favorable overpotentials and Tafel potentials of 180 mV and 162 mV/dec, respectively towards OER activity. On the other hand, as a photocatalysis, they portrayed outstanding degradation efficiency under visible light irradiation towards Congo red (CR) dye degradation. Within the short treatment time higher CR degradation efficiency is achieved. These photo-electroactive spinel hollow spheres accelerate efficient OER and visible-light-driven photocatalysis with remarkable stability. They serve as an excellent example of a multifunctional heterogeneous catalyst. Finally, the obtained results indicate the current needs and future demands for enhancing the prospects of multifunctional semiconductor catalysts.
