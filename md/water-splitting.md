Abstract Rechargeable zinc‐air batteries (ZABs) rely on the development of high‐performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to facilitate efficient oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Single‐atom catalysts (SACs), characterized by their precisely defined active sites, have great potential for applications in ZABs. However, the design and architecture of atomic site electrocatalysts with both high activity and durability present significant challenges, owing to their spatial confinement and electronic states. In this study, a strategy is proposed to fabricate structurally uniform dual single‐atom electrocatalyst (denoted as P‐FeCo/NC) consisting of P‐bridging Fe and Co bimetal atom (i.e., Fe‐P‐Co) decorated on N, P‐co‐doped carbon framework as an efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for ZABs. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Fe‐P‐Co bridge‐coupling structure enables a facile adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates and low activation barrier. The resultant P‐FeCo/NC exhibits ultralow overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for OER and high half‐wave potential of 0.95 V for ORR. In addition, the application of P‐FeCo/NC in rechargeable ZABs demonstrates enhanced performance with maximum power density of 115 mW cm −2 and long cyclic stability, which surpass Pt/C and RuO 2 catalysts. This study provides valuable insights into the design and mechanism of atomically dispersed catalysts for energy conversion applications.

Abstract Ensuring high catalytic activity and durability at low Ir usage is still a big challenge for the development of electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Here, a rapid liquid‐reduction combined with surface galvanic replacement strategy is reported to synthesize the sub 2 nm high‐entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles featured with Ir‐rich IrRuNiMo medium‐entropy oxide shell (Ir‐MEO) and a IrRuCoNiMo HEA core (HEA@Ir‐MEO), which exhibits a low overpotential of 243 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and high mass activity (261.5 A g Ir −1 ). Advanced spectroscopies reveal that the Ir‐rich MEO shell inhibits the severe structural evolution of transition metals upon the OER, thus guaranteeing the structural stability. In‐situ DEMS, activation energy analysis and DFT calculations unveil that the OER on HEA@Ir‐MEO follows an adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway, where the energy barrier of rate‐determining step is substantially lowered, interpreting the enhanced OER kinetics. The optimized catalyst is assembled into PEM electrolyzer with low Ir usage of ca. 0.4 mg cm −2 , and to give the excellent performance (1.85 V/3.0 A cm −2 °C), long‐term stability (>500 h@1.0 Acm −2 ) and low energy consumption (3.98 kWh Nm −3 H 2 @1.0 A cm −2 ), realizing the dramatical reduction of hydrogen production cost to USD 0.88 per kg H 2 .

Abstract Electrochemical activation usually accompanies in situ atom rearrangement forming new catalytic sites with higher activity due to reconstructed atomic clusters or amorphous phases with abundant dangling bonds, vacancies, and defects. By harnessing the pre‐catalytic process of reconstruction, a multilevel structure of CuNi alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in N‐doped carbon (CuNi nanoalloy@N/C) transforms into a highly active compound of Ni‐doped CuO nanocluster supported on (N/O‐C) co‐doped C. Both the exposure of accessible active sites and the activity of individual active sites are greatly improved after the pre‐catalytic reconstruction. Manipulating the Cu/Ni ratios of CuNi nanoalloy@N/C can tailor the electronic property and d‐band center of the high‐active compound, which greatly optimizes the energetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates. This interplay among Cu, Ni, C, N, and O modifies the interface, triggers the active sites, and regulates the work functions, thereby realizing a synergistic boost in OER.

Transforming the Pt–M alloy into an ordered intermetallic is an effective strategy to improve the electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the synthesis of nanosized intermetallics remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient ORR electrocatalyst, consisting of a monodisperse nanosized PtCu intermetallic on hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (HMCS). As predicted by theoretical calculations, PtCu intermetallics exhibit beneficial electronic structure, with a low theoretical overpotential of 0.33 V and enhanced Cu stability. Resulting from the multiscale modulation of catalyst structure, the O-PtCu/HMCS catalyst delivers a high mass activity of 2.73 A cm–2Pt at 0.9 V and remarkable stability. Identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) investigations demonstrate that the rate of carbon corrosion is alleviated on HMCS, which contributes to the long-term durability. This work provides a promising design strategy for an ORR electrocatalyst, and the IL-TEM investigations offer new perspectives for the performance enhancement mechanism.

Global energy consumption increases year after year, causing the depletion of non-renewable sources. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global demand for electrical energy is expected to increase by 3.3 % in 2024. Therefore, developing new renewable sources is urgent, including new devices for energy storage and conversion, particularly those based on electrochemical reactions. Water splitting is a clean and sustainable technology capable of facing this issue by producing oxygen and hydrogen from water and electricity. However, an issue related to this technology is the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, making it necessary to develop new electrocatalysts with high electrochemical performance. To meet this requirement, this work deals, for the first time, with a high entropy oxide with a rock-salt structure synthesized by a green sol-gel synthesis using red seaweed (Rhodophyta) as a polymerizing agent. Sol-gel synthesis allows the large-scale production of nanomaterials with high uniformity and dispersion of the chemical elements involved. The literature, which discussed the synthesis of these oxides, reveals that agents harmful to the environment are employed, including sodium hydroxide, acetic acid, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, urea, and ammonium hydroxide. The composition of the high entropy oxide is (Mg0.2Ni0.2Co0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O. As electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, it exhibits a low overpotential (336 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2), a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec-1, and excellent durability. The electrochemical performance of the high entropy oxide prepared in this work is superior to other electrocatalysts of the same class that were produced using transition metal-based precursors.

This work utilized an innovative and economical remediation method to convert inexpensive waste feedstock into extremely useful catalysts. The procedure centered on polyethylene (PE), an easily accessible substance, and effectively transformed it at a mild temperature utilizing a new solvothermal technique, which entailed the reaction of sulfuric acid with PE chains at 120 °C. Throughout this process, the polymer experienced a pivotal cross-linking stage, resulting in its conversion into carbon materials when exposed to temperatures above 500 °C. To improve the catalytic characteristics, platinum (Pt) was effectively integrated into the resultant carbon matrix using the existing impregnation technique. Further, the catalyst's physicochemical properties were thoroughly analyzed utilizing SEM, FTIR, and XRD techniques. After that, the catalyst's performance was thoroughly evaluated in several electrocatalytic reactions, such as methanol oxidation, oxygen evolution and reduction reactions, and hydrogen evolution. The results of this investigation reveal the impressive electrocatalytic ability of the Pt/C catalyst made from waste plastic. It was found to be comparable to the best commercially available Pt/C catalysts in all the reactions that were examined. This research not only demonstrates the possibility of using waste plastic for catalyst production, but also serves as the first documented example, based on successfully converting waste plastic bags into Pt/C through the conventional Liquid Phase Reduction (LPR) process. This novel method has great potential for sustainable and ecologically responsible catalytic applications.

Transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely used in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its greatest atomic utilization and low costs, which catalytic performance can be further enhanced by electron distribution adjustment. Herein, we synthesized a carbon-encapsulated FeS/Fe3C nanoparticles doped carbon-based Fe single atom catalyst from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) slurry though a one-pot pyrolysis. The synergistic effect between FeS/Fe3C nanoparticles and Fe single atom structure (FeNx) promotes the ORR/OER processes, which may due to the reduction of the adsorption free energy of intermediates. Meanwhile, the polyaromatic hydrocarbon in FCC slurry enhances the graphitization of catalyst to facilitate charge transfer in electrocatalysis process, and the carbon-encapsulated nanoparticles sites possess higher stability and dispersion. As a result, the optimized catalyst (FeS/Fe3C@Fe-N-C) presents a high nanoparticles dispersion and graphitization level, which has a higher ORR catalytic ability (E1/2 = 0.91 V vs RHE) compared with commercial Pt/C (20 wt%, E1/2 = 0.879 V vs RHE) and a similar OER catalytic ability (E10 = 0.1.506 V vs RHE) compared with RuO2 (E10 = 1.518 V vs RHE). A liquid Zn-air battery assembled with FeS/Fe3C@Fe-N-C show a peak power density of 113 mW cm−2 and an open potential of 1.432 V. This work sheds light on a new method to design transition metal active sites carbon based single-atom catalyst for enhanced ORR and OER processes.

Strong interfacial coupling in the hybrid catalysts could enhance catalytic performances. In this work, N, P were co-doped in zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) derived Co-based materials (denoted as CoP/NC) via in-situ carbonization and phosphating strategy, which accordingly induced strong interfacial coupling, leading to promote the catalytic activity in overall water splitting. In detail, the CoP/NC-2 presents the overpotential of 98 and 139 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH at 10 mA cm−2, respectively, and 295 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH at 20 mA cm−2, which is excellent during the non-noble metal-based catalysts. It also achieved a potential of 1.69 V (η20) in the overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) based calculation reveals that the in-situ N, P co-doping induced strong interface coupling, which enhances the interaction in the interface of catalysts and improves electron conduction. More importantly, it contributes to adjusting electronic structure and d-band center, optimizing the adsorption energy for HER and/or OER and improving the kinetics of water splitting reaction. This work sheds new light on the heteroatom doping strategy to construct bifunctional transition metal-based electrocatalyst with boosting electrocatalytic performance in energy conversion application.

Amorphous transition-metal-phospho-borides (TMPBs) are emerging as a new class of hybrid bifunctional catalysts for water-splitting. The present work reports the discovery of CoWPB as a new promising material that adds to the smaller family of TMPBs. The optimized compositions, namely Co4WPB5 and Co2WPB1 could achieve 10 mA/cm2 at just 72 mV and 262 mV of overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, the catalyst showed good performance in a 2-electrode assembly (1.59 V for 10 mA/cm2) with considerable stability (70 h stability, 10,000 operating cycles). Detailed morphological and electrochemical characterizations unveiled insights into the role of all elements in catalyst's improved performance. The presence of W was found to be crucial in improving the electronic conductivity and charge redistribution, making CoWPB suitable for both HER and OER. In computational simulation analysis, two configurations with different atomic environments, namely, CoWPBH and CoWPBO were found to have the lowest calculated overpotentials for HER and OER, respectively. It was found that the surface P-sites in CoWPBH were HER-active while the Co-sites in CoWPBO were OER-active sites. The study presents new knowledge about active sites in such multi-component catalysts that will foster more advancement in the area of water electrolysis.

High-entropy materials (HEMs) play a significant role in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their unique properties. However, there are still challenges in the preparation of HEMs for OER catalysts. In this study, the FeCoNiMnCr catalyst is synthesized for the first time using the ultrasonic hydrothermal-sintering technique and exhibits excellent performance for OER electrocatalysis. There is an optimal ultrasonic hydrothermal time and power for achieving the best OER performance. The results demonstrate that the performance of FeCoNiMnCr catalysts prepared through ultrasonic hydrothermal sintering (US-FeCoNiMnCr) is significantly improved compared with the traditional hydrothermal-sintering method. The US-FeCoNiMnCr catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 228 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope as low as 45.39 mV dec−1 in an alkaline medium. Moreover, the US-FeCoNiMnCr catalyst demonstrates remarkable stability in electrocatalytic OER with a minimal potential increase observed even after 48 h. This work not only provides valuable insights into high-entropy material synthesis, but also presents a powerful electrocatalyst for water electrolysis.

The development of low‐cost transition metal compounds with high‐performance for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in promoting the development of electrocatalysis. In this study, a Ce‐doped Ni3S4 catalyst (Ce0.2‐Ni3S4) was synthesized through a one‐step solvothermal method, where the doped rare earth element Ce induced the transformation of NiS to Ni3S4. The Ce0.2‐Ni3S4 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance in 1 M KOH. At a current density of 10 mA cm‐2, it showed a low overpotential of 230 mV and a low Tafel slope of 52.39 mV dec‐1. Long‐term OER tests at the same potential lasted for 24 h without significant loss of current density. This work introduces a novel method of Ce element doping for modifying transition metal sulfides, providing new insights into the effective utilization of rare earth elements in the field of electrochemistry. It creates more chances for the progress of highly efficient catalysts for efficient OER, contributing to the advancement of electrocatalysis.

It is important for the practical application of water electrolysis to explore stable and earth-rich bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). An immersion-selenization strategy was proposed to prepare CoSe2/Co nanorods anchored on Co foam as bifunctional catalysts for OER and UOR. Due to the self-supported properties of CoSe2/Co and its unique nanorod structure, the OER activity is enhanced, showing an overpotential of 318 mV and a Tafel slope of 91.11 mV dec–1. In addition, the electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic UOR activity with an overpotential of 260 mV and a Tafel slope of 94.83 mV dec–1. The nanorod structure was basically retained after a 28 h durability test. This work provides a broad approach to the development of low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Electrochemical water splitting is regarded as an effective technology for producing green hydrogen, which is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. In particular, direct seawater splitting offers significant economic and environmental advantages. However, its efficiency is hindered by the high overpotential required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the competition from chloride oxidation. This review highlights the potential of interface engineering to overcome these limitations and develop efficient OER electrocatalysts. We comprehensively explore recent advancements in interface engineering for OER in both alkaline and seawater environments. We begin by introducing the mechanisms of freshwater and seawater electrolysis, emphasizing key considerations for OER catalyst design. Subsequently, we review the recent progress made in various interface engineering strategies, analyzing their impact on OER performance in both electrolytes. Finally, we outline promising future directions for developing efficient seawater oxidation catalysts through interface engineering.

Exploring efficient, low-cost electrocatalysts is critical for improving the efficiency of water splitting reactions. Noble-metal-based oxides exhibit high activities in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their high cost and the lack of natural resources hinder their practical application. Therefore, in this study, we successfully synthesized an FeCoNiMgB high-entropy boride powder via a facile chemical reduction method for use as an OER catalyst in an alkaline medium. The FeCoNiMgB powder, with an ultrathin fluffy cotton structure, exhibited an excellent OER catalytic performance, affording an overpotential of 268 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a low Tafel slope of 42.9 mV/dec; this performance was superior to those of FeCoNiB, FeNiMgB, CoNiMgB, FeCoMgB, and commercial RuO2. The FeCoNiMgB powder also displayed remarkably stable catalytic properties for >72 h with no clear evidence of degradation. Finally, using theoretical calculations, the excellent OER performance of FeCoNiMgB was verified in terms of its adsorption and charge transfer energies and covalence. The performance and stability of FeCoNiMgB were equivalent or superior to those of several nanostructured catalysts, and thus, this study provided valuable insight into the design of efficient high-entropy boride materials.

The development and design of high performance OER catalyst is the key to electrocatalysis technology. Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT), the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism of double rare earth europium-doped graphene under hydroxyl modification in alkaline environment has been systematically studied. Through thermodynamic and kinetic stability analysis, and the optimal reaction path and different adsorption sites of intermediates were compared. Four catalysts with good catalytic activity for OER reaction were selected. The results show that when the two hydroxyl groups are modified, the overpotentials on the optimal pathway for the four catalyst configurations are 0.54 V, 0.50 V, 0.54 V, and 0.61 V, respectively. These catalysts demonstrate excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, these catalysts have good electrical conductivity, and the active site and adsorption intermediates can be stably bonded together. In addition, the scaling relationship between oxygen adsorption free energy and overpotential is described. This work may provide new insights and guidance for future research on rare-earth atom-based OER catalysts.
