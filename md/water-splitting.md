Abstract As promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, spinel‐type oxides face the bottleneck of weak adsorption for oxygen‐containing intermediates, so it is challenging to make a further breakthrough in remarkably lowering the OER overpotential. In this study, a novel strategy is proposed to substantially enhance the OER activity of spinel oxides based on amorphous/crystalline phases mixed spinel FeNi 2 O 4 nanosheets array, enriched with oxygen vacancies, in situ grown on a nickel foam (NF). This unique architecture is achieved through a one‐step millisecond laser direct writing method. The presence of amorphous phases with abundant oxygen vacancies significantly enhances the adsorption of oxygen‐containing intermediates and changes the rate‐determining step from OH*→O* to O*→OOH*, which greatly reduces the thermodynamic energy barrier. Moreover, the crystalline phase interweaving with amorphous domains serves as a conductive shortcut to facilitate rapid electron transfer from active sites in the amorphous domain to NF, guaranteeing fast OER kinetics. Such an anodic electrode exhibits a nearly ten fold enhancement in OER intrinsic activity compared to the pristine counterpart. Remarkably, it demonstrates record‐low overpotentials of 246 and 315 mV at 50 and 500 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH with superior long‐term stability, outperforming other NiFe‐based spinel oxides catalysts.

Molecular assemblies represent a classical type of active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while the practical application is limited by the relatively low electrical conductivity. Herein, a cobalt molecular assembly was synthesized and supported by a conductive phosphorus doped graphene. It served as a potential OER electrocatalyst by affording a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of 390 mV, and the turnover frequency of cobalt sites was increased by 21.5 times comparing to the assembly supported by the pristine graphene. Our observations unveil that the potential linking of oxidized phosphorus atoms in the carbon matrix is mainly responsible for the high activity of cobalt molecular assembly. The overall OER catalytic cycle was analyzed by in situ attenuated total reflectance-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, suggesting that the formation of *OOH species on the cobalt sites could be critical for the final evolution of oxygen. These results open a potential avenue into the exploration of highly active OER electrocatalysts toward replacing the noble metals based electrocatalysts.

Upcycling bagasse into functional materials such as electrocatalysts and adsorbents is crucial for renewable energy and water remediation. The present work accounts for preparing in-situ nickel-engineered graphitic-layered carbon (Ni@GLC) using different loading of Ni2+ on bagasse waste by carbonization technique. Various spectro-analytical and physiochemical techniques are used to characterize and elucidate the plausible mechanism of in situ carbonization and grafting of Ni on GLC. Initially, the Ni@GLC was employed as an electrocatalyst for OER reaction under ambient conditions. Results revealed that effective nickel loading Ni@GLC-2 showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity with a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec−1 and ɳ of 284 mV (vs. RHE) to drive j10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline medium (pH 13). The material showed 12 h chronoamperometry (CA) stability. Further, in the case of water remediation, Ni@GLC-2 was employed as an adsorbent through the adsorption technique using Methy orange (MO), Amido black (AB), and regular hair dye (HD) as emerging pollutants. Reaction variables such as the effect of pH and dosage study were investigated and discussed. Results revealed that time-dependent kinetic data was better fitted for the pseudo-second-order model, and isotherm studies with the Langmuir model attained qm capacity of 2232 and 617 mg g−1 for MO and AB, respectively. Interestingly, 96 % removal of Garnier color naturals HD was achieved. Based on the results obtained from ζ-potential and FT-IR analysis support the interaction between the dye and Ni@GLC-2. We believe this work opens new outcomes for designing and synthesizing efficient electrocatalysts and sorbents for energy development and environmental conservation.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) impedes the electrochemical water splitting for H2 production, ascribing to the depressed kinetics of the four proton-coupled transfer process. Transition metal oxides, especially bimetallic oxides, have been proven to be promising OER electrocatalysts due to their part unoccupied d-band characteristics. More interestingly, oxygen vacancies (Ov) easily constructed in transition metal oxides can modulate the electron structures and thereby boost the OER performance. However, most synthesized processes involving oxygen vacancy engineering, such as atom dopant, chemical/electrochemical reduction, and H2/Ar-dependent calcination, are energy-intensive and time-consuming, largely hampering their commercial applications. Herein, we suggest a simple and facile strategy for fabricating double spinel oxides with abundant oxygen vacancies by calcinating Ni/Fe@ZIF-67/CC precursor under a nonoxidation condition. The obtained Ov-CF1N2O@NC/CC-550 with vast oxygen vacancies exhibits excellent OER performance, representing a lower overpotential of 185 mV at 10 mA cm–2, smaller Tafel slope of 47.3 mV dec–1, as well as faster interface reaction kinetics (Rct = 0.7336). Theoretical calculations further confirm that the excellent electrochemical activity strongly corresponds to the lower d-band center of active sites on the Ov-CoFe2O4 (311) model and decreased reaction Gibbs energy barrier. The work might shed light on oxygen vacancy engineering via a simple and facile strategy and inspire a smart design of multimetallic oxide electrocatalysts with high OER performance.

The potential of the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) to serve as a vital source of electrons for reducing water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia is an area of intense research. Among the numerous catalysts investigated for the OER, Ir compounds have emerged as particularly promising candidates. A notable highlight of this study is the concurrent OER activity of both Ir and Fe. Remarkably, Ir independently exhibits high OER activity, even at exceedingly low overpotentials, establishing its distinctiveness among other metal oxides. Under alkaline conditions, the presence of both Fe and Ir (hydr)oxides in OER systems introduces complexity, given that Fe (hydr)oxides are also known for their efficiency in the OER. This combination of elements creates a multifaceted reaction environment, where the unique properties of each component interact, influencing the overall OER process. In this study, the focus is on investigating the OER process on an Ir wire in an alkaline environment (with pH 13 and 14) in the presence of K2FeO4. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the reaction, various techniques, such as electrochemical methods, X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were employed. Following an in-depth investigation and detailed analysis of the interaction between K2FeO4 and an Ir wire, it was observed that the activity of the OER increased at overpotentials exceeding 320 mV. The observed improvement was limited to cases where Fe species had deposited on the surface of the Ir wire. The Tafel slopes were found to be 196.10 (149.20) and 102.16 (56.30) mV/decade for the Ir electrode in 0.10 M (1.0 M) KOH, in the absence and presence of K2FeO4, respectively. XAS analysis revealed the presence of the FeHyOx species on the surface of IrO2. These experiments indicate that Fe and Ir sites can independently catalyze the OER without exhibiting any synergistic interaction between them.

Corrosion engineering is an effective way to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of alloys. However, the impact of grain boundary corrosion on the structure and electrochemical performance of alloy is still unknown. Herein, the vacuum arc-melted CrCoNiFe alloys with interlaced network structures via grain boundary corrosion methods were fabricated. The grain boundaries that existed as defects were severely corroded and an interlaced network structure was formed, promoting the exposure of the active site and the release of gas bubbles. Besides, the (oxy)hydroxides layer (25 nm) on the surface could act as the true active center and improve the surface wettability. Benefiting from the unique structure and constructed surface, the CrCoNiFe-12 affords a high urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance with the lowest overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH adding 0.33 M urea. The CrCoNiFe-12||Pt only required a cell voltage of 1.485 V to afford 10 mA/cm2 for UOR and long-term stability of 100 h at 10 mA/cm2 (27.6 mV decrease). These findings offer a facile strategy for designing bulk multiple-principal-element alloy electrodes for energy conversion.

Abstract The dynamic surface self‐reconstruction behavior in local structure correlates with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, which has become an effective strategy for constructing the catalytic active phase. However, it remains a challenge to understand the mechanisms of reconstruction and to accomplish it fast and deeply. Here, we reported a photo‐promoted rapid reconstruction (PRR) process on Ag nanoparticle‐loaded amorphous Ni‐Fe hydroxide nanosheets on carbon cloth for enhanced OER. The photogenerated holes generated by Ag in conjunction with the anodic potential contributed to a thorough reconstruction of the amorphous substrate. The valence state of unsaturated coordinated Fe atoms, which serve as active sites, is significantly increased, while the corresponding crystalline substrate shows little change. The different structural evolutions of amorphous and crystalline substrates during reconstruction lead to diverse pathways of OER. This PRR utilizing loaded noble metal nanoparticles can accelerate the generation of active species in the substrate and increase the electrical conductivity, which provides a new inspiration to develop efficient catalysts via reconstruction strategies.

High entropy compounds were proven to exhibit excellent catalytic activity. Here, a series of amorphous CrMnFeCoNi Oxy-carbide films were successfully synthesized by one-step electrodeposition. As demonstrated, the film presented superior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. Uniquely, selective dissolution of Chromium (Cr) was observed, which increased the catalytic activity and showed high stability under a large current density of up to 400 mA/cm2. Cr dissolution not only increased the surface area but also improved the conductivity due to newly formed metal-metal bonding, promoting electron transfer and improving OER performance. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Cr-dissolution mediates the bonding of OER intermediates over surface active sites and ultimately reduces OER overpotential. The one-step electrodeposition method and the micro-dissolution mechanism provided a potential way to design and prepare high entropy compound electrodes, aiming to achieve efficient water electrolysis.

Equimolar or nearly molar mixtures of five or more metals are used to create high-entropy oxides (HEOs). HEOs also possess the kinetic slow diffusion effect, structural lattice distortion, the thermodynamic high-entropy effect, and the cocktail effect. Consequently, a growing number of scientists are investigating high-entropy oxides. High active site density, low overpotential, and entropic stabilization effects are the main reasons why HEOs now show good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. However, the complexity of the elemental composition, organization, and surface morphology of high-entropy oxides limits the use of HEOs. The development of HEOs and the mechanisms behind OER are reviewed in this work, along with a description of the OER response pathways and evaluation standards. The OER performance of HEOs with diverse organizational structures is reviewed in this research because HEOs come in a variety of kinds. Additionally, when HEOs are utilized as carriers, the trend of OER performance is examined. Lastly, potential future development problems and opportunities for HEO electrocatalysts are discussed.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to the water splitting and CO 2 reduction reactions, while this reaction is kinetically sluggish and demands the efficient electrocatalyst. Transition metal selenides (TMSes) have gained greater attention as nonprecious metal‐based electrocatalysts due to their low cost, earth abundance, and high efficiency. Typically, TMSe can exhibit superior OER activity to their counterparts such as hydroxides/oxyhydroxides and sulfides. As such, their unique way to boost the catalytic activity is intriguing to researchers and many studies have been recently carried out. The last decades have witnessed the rapid development of TMSe‐based electrocatalysts in design and preparation for OER. However, there is still no exclusive review summarizing the recent development of this material for OER electrocatalysis. Herein, this article underscores the significant promise of TMSes in advancing the field of high‐performance OER electrocatalysts. The research progress is summarized and the importance of strategies to improve the performance of selenide electrodes including multimetal composite, hybrid composite with carbonaceous materials, morphological engineering, heterostructure engineering, and vacancies engineering is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and opportunities concerning the improvement of TMSe electrocatalysts are outlined, which are essential for their further application in electrochemical energy conversion.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of hydrogen adsorption on titanium nitride had previously shown that hydrogen may adsorb on both titanium and nitrogen sites with a moderate adsorption energy. Further, the diffusion barrier was also found to be low. These findings may qualify TiN, a versatile multifunctional material with electronic conductivity, as electrode material for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This was the main impetus of this work which aims to experimentally and theoretically investigate the electrocatalytic properties of TiN-layers that were processed on Ti substrate using reactive ion sputtering. The properties are discussed focusing on the role of oxygen defects introduced during the sputtering process on the HER. Based on DFT calculations, it is shown that these oxygen defects alter the electronic environment of the Ti atoms which entails a low hydrogen adsorption energy in the range of -0.1 eV; this leads to HER performances that match those of Pt-NPs in acidic media. When a few nanometr thick layer of Pd-NPs is sputtered on-top of the TiN-layer, the performance is drastically reduced. This is interpreted in terms of oxygen defects being scavenged by the Pd-NPs near the surface which is thought to reduce the hydrogen adsorption sites.

Water splitting is an important way to obtain hydrogen applied in clean energy, which mainly consists of two half-reactions: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the kinetics of the OER of water splitting, which occurs at the anode, is slow and inefficient, especially in acid. Currently, the main OER catalysts are still based on noble metals, such as Ir and Ru, which are the main active components. Hence, the exploration of new OER catalysts with low cost, high activity, and stability has become a key issue in the research of electrolytic water hydrogen production technology. In this paper, the reaction mechanism of OER in acid was discussed and summarized, and the main methods to improve the activity and stability of non-noble metal OER catalysts were summarized and categorized. Finally, the future prospects of OER catalysts in acid were made to provide a little reference idea for the development of advanced OER catalysts in acid in the future.

Abstract This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance– surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR–SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1–13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied here to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2–7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions— lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency—showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.

The composition and crystal structure are crucial parameters for the activity and stability of the electrocatalysts. Herein, we synthesize a series of CoxNi–B oxide nanosheets with low degree of crystallinity for alkaline media oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The sample with an optimized ratio Co8Ni–B oxide shows the best OER performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 312 mV and a Tafel slope of 47 mV/dec in the 1 M KOH electrolyte. This sample is stable in the purified Fe-free KOH electrolyte and strongly activated in the nonpurified commercial electrolyte due to the Fe impurity uptake. The high surface area and partially crystalline structure caused by boron incorporation and low-temperature treatment provide more accessible active sites with retaining good stability against leaching during the OER. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy investigation reveals the formation of OER active Co and Ni oxyhydroxides in Co8Ni–B oxides under a potential bias. The Ni substitution in Co oxides modulates the electronic structure of Co, and the OER activity of the electrocatalyst can be enhanced by Fe uptake from the KOH electrolyte.

Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising route for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high overpotential of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction poses significant challenge. SrIrO 3 -based perovskite-type catalysts have shown great potential for acidic oxygen evolution reaction, but the origins of their high activity are still unclear. Herein, we develop a Co-doped SrIrO 3 system to enhance oxygen evolution reaction activity and elucidate the origin of catalytic activity. In situ experiments reveal Co activates surface lattice oxygen, rapidly exposing IrO x active sites, while bulk Co doping optimizes the adsorbate binding energy of IrO x . The Co-doped SrIrO 3 demonstrates high oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity, markedly surpassing the commercial IrO 2 catalysts in both conventional electrolyzer and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.

Modification of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is recently under the spotlight due to their versatile properties and potential applications in electrochemical catalysis. Here, we successfully demonstrate nitrogen doping into the MOF electrocatalyst without noble metals using a facile, tunable ion beam sputtering (IBS) process for the first time and evaluate the role of the incorporated heteroatom. Two-dimensional Ni-naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid MOF (NiNDC) with large surface area was subjected to nitrogen IBS (NIBS) and exhibited significantly improved performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 222 mV at 10 mA cm−2; a Tafel slope of 88 mV dec-1; and over 120 h of stability at 100 mA cm−2. The relationship between the nitrogen functionalities and catalytic activity was elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, i.e., (i) pyridinic N as an electron-withdrawing group that directly enhances the reaction kinetics, (ii) pyrrolic N to stabilize the catalyst and (iii) graphitic N to enhance the electrical conductivity. We found that the electrocatalytic performance was affected by the ratio of the three nitrogen species, which was controllable by the accelerating potential (AP) of NIBS. This study provides insights into the influence of the chemical state of MOF surfaces on catalytic reactions and presents a novel method for effective nitrogen doping.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process for sustainable energy, although renewable sources require the use of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, with IrO 2 -based materials being the gold standard due to their high activity and stability under dynamic anodic polarization conditions. However, even for the (110) facet of a single-crystalline IrO 2 model electrode, the reaction mechanism is not settled yet due to contradictory reports in literature. In the present manuscript, we disentangle the conflicting results of previous theoretical studies in the density functional theory approximation. We demonstrate that dissimilar reaction mechanisms and limiting steps for the OER over IrO 2 (110) are obtained for different active surface configurations present on the IrO 2 electrode. In contrast to previous studies, we factor Walden-type mechanisms, in which the formation of the product O 2 and adsorption of the reactant H 2 O occur simultaneously, into the analysis of the elementary steps. Combining free-energy diagrams along the reaction coordinate and Bader charge analysis of the active site under constant potential, we elucidate why mononuclear- or bifunctional-Walden pathways excel the traditional OER mechanisms for the OER over IrO 2 (110). Our computational methodology to identify the reaction mechanism and limiting step of proton-coupled electron transfer steps is universally applicable to electrochemical processes in the field of energy conversion and storage.

Abstract Developing highly active and stable electrocatalysts is essential for the large‐scale production of hydrogen from alkaline water. In this work, Ag single atoms and nanoparticles co‐decorated Co hydro(oxy)oxide (Ag SAs&NPs@CoO(O)H) is synthesized by a facile one‐step approach. Notably, the overpotential of Ag SAs&NPs@CoO(O)H is 200 mV at current density of 50 mA cm −2 during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Meanwhile, it can display the mass activity of 637.47 A g −1 Ag under 300 mV, which is 212.49 times higher than that of commercial IrO 2 . Moreover, the assembled Pt/C // Ag SAs&NPs@CoO(O)H system only requires 1.9 V to reach an industrial current density of 1000 mA cm −2 in alkaline water electrolyzer and exhibits excellent stability at large current density of 1000 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis coupled with theoretical calculations reveals an novel active site switching mechanism is found on Ag SAs&NPs@CoO(O)H. Specifically, the O* preferentially generates on the Ag NPs and then switches toward the Co 3+ site in CoO(O)H to produce OOH* and O 2 . Meanwhile, the Ag SAs in the lattice of CoO(O)H can exert an inhibitory force on the reconstruction process of CoOOH to Co(OH) 2 , resulting in excellent anti‐dissolution stability.

DFT optimised structures used to calculate the OER activities in "Cation Insertion to Break the Activity/Stability Relationship for Highly Active Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalyst". The structures are bundled in two databases, LiIrO3.db which contains all structures for alpha-LiIrO3 and KLiIrO3-disordered.db which contains all the structures for the disordered Li0.75K0.25(H2O)0.50IrO3 structure. The structures can be retrieved using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE, https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html). The keywords 'ads' and 'surface' can be used to search the structure, e.g. surface='Z-step' and ads='*OOH' will give the structure with OOH adsorbed on the Z-step surface (see paper for details on the different surfaces).

This dataset was used to generate the figures in the abovementioned paper, accepted for publication in Nature Communications. Paper abstract: The oxygenation of early Earth’s atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event, is generally accepted to have been caused by oceanic Cyanobacterial oxygenic photosynthesis. Recent studies suggest that Fe(II) toxicity delayed the Cyanobacterial expansion necessary for the GOE. This study investigates the effects of Fe(II) on two Cyanobacteria, Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367 and Synechococcus sp. PCC7336, in a simulated shallow-water marine Archean environment. A similar Fe(II) toxicity response was observed as reported for closed batch cultures. This toxicity was not observed in cultures provided with continuous gaseous exchange that showed significantly shorter doubling times than the closed-culture system, even with repeated nocturnal addition of Fe(II) for 12 days. The green rust formed under high Fe(II) conditions, was not found to be directly toxic to Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367. In summary, we present evidence of diurnal Fe cycling in a simulated shallow-water marine environment for two ancestral strains of Cyanobacteria, with increased O2 production under anoxic conditions.

Metal–cation doping is a fundamental strategy for enhancing catalyst performance. Fe-doped Ni0.85Se/NF (Fe-Ni0.85Se/NF) nanoparticles were prepared at 80°C via Fe2+ etching method. The addition of Fe altered the coordination environment of the Ni species along with the catalyst's morphology, creating additional active sites. Notably, the synergistic interaction between the bimetallic components augmented the built-in activity and accelerated reaction kinetics. The Fe-Ni0.85Se/NF electrocatalysts demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an acceptable overpotential of 276 mV and a Tafel slope of 58.1 mV dec−1 at 100 mA cm−2. Moreover, they demonstrated exceptional durability. In situ Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses showed that the excellent OER performance stemmed from the reconstruction-induced hydroxyl oxide. This study offers a novel approach for streamlining the synthesis procedures and reducing the experimental costs for developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts.

The generation of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier by photocatalysis as a zero-emission technology is of significant scientific interest. However, the main drawback of photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting is its low efficiency compared to traditional chemical or electrochemical methods. Zinc oxide (ZnO) with the wurtzite phase is one of the most investigated photocatalysts for hydrogen production, but its activity still needs to be improved. In this study, an oxygen-deficient high-pressure ZnO rocksalt phase is stabilized using a high-pressure method, and the product is used for photocatalysis under ambient pressure. The simultaneous introduction of oxygen vacancy and the rocksalt phase effectively improved photocatalytic hydrogen production to levels comparable to benchmark P25 TiO2, due to improving light absorbance and providing active sites for photocatalysis without any negative effect on electron-hole recombination. These results confirm the high potential of high-pressure phases for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.

Developing novel high-entropy oxide electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution is a promising strategy to accelerate the alkaline water electrolysis kinetics by optimizing the reaction paths. Herein, we demonstrate a high-strain senary (FeCoNiCrMnCu)3O4 electrocatalyst with remarkably increased highly active lattice oxygen, which follows the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism instead of the traditional adsorbate-evolution mechanism for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A supersmall overpotential of 241.4 mV is required to obtain 10 mA cm–2 and a considerable current retention rate of 94.9% is attained after continuously operating for 72 h. The oxygen diffusion coefficient is 1.97 × 10–14 cm2 s–1, 5.6 times larger than the (FeCoNi)3O4, ensuring the rapid replenishment during water oxidation. The OER activity surpasses those of most of the reported spinel oxide electrocatalysts. More impressively, the assembled anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can deliver an industrial-level current density of 1.0 A cm–2 under the cell voltage of 1.79 V, exhibiting an attractive application potential.

Layered LnBaCo2O6-δ perovskites are important mixed ionic-electronic conductors, exhibiting outstanding catalytic properties for the oxygen evolution/reduction reaction. These phases exhibit considerable structural complexity, in particular, near room temperature, where a number of oxygen vacancy ordered superstructures are found. This study uses bond valence site energy calculations to demonstrate the key underlying structural features that favor facile ionic migration. BVSE calculations show that the 1D vacancy ordering for Ln = Sm–Tb could be beneficial at low temperatures as new pathways with reduced barriers emerge. By contrast, the 2D vacancy ordering for Ln = Dy and Y is not beneficial for ionic transport with the basic layered parent material having lower migration barriers. Overall, the key criterion for low migration barriers is an expanded ab plane, supported by Ba, coupled to a small Ln size. Hence, Ln = Y should be the best composition, but this is stymied by the low temperature 2D vacancy ordering and moderate temperature stability. The evolution of the oxygen cycling capability of these materials is also reported.

Salt stress significantly impacts the functions of the photosynthetic apparatus, with varying degrees of damage to its components. Photosystem II (PSII) is more sensitive to environmental stresses, including salinity, than photosystem I (PSI). This study investigated the effects of different salinity levels (0 to 200 mM NaCl) on the PSII complex in isolated thylakoid membranes from hydroponically grown pea (Pisum sativum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) plants treated with NaCl for 5 days. The data revealed that salt stress inhibits the photochemical activity of PSII (H2O → BQ), affecting the energy transfer between the pigment–protein complexes of PSII (as indicated by the fluorescence emission ratio F695/F685), QA reoxidation, and the function of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). These processes were more significantly affected in pea than in maize under salinity. Analysis of the oxygen evolution curves after flashes and continuous illumination showed a stronger influence on the PSIIα than PSIIβ centers. The inhibition of oxygen evolution was associated with an increase in misses (α), double hits (β), and blocked centers (SB) and a decrease in the rate constant of turnover of PSII reaction centers (KD). Salinity had different effects on the two pathways of QA reoxidation in maize and pea. In maize, the electron flow from QA- to plastoquinone was dominant after treatment with higher NaCl concentrations (150 mM and 200 mM), while in pea, the electron recombination on QAQB- with oxidized S2 (or S3) of the OEC was more pronounced. Analysis of the 77 K fluorescence emission spectra revealed changes in the ratio of the light-harvesting complex of PSII (LHCII) monomers and trimers to LHCII aggregates after salt treatment. There was also a decrease in pigment composition and an increase in oxidative stress markers, membrane injury index, antioxidant activity (FRAP assay), and antiradical activity (DPPH assay). These effects were more pronounced in pea than in maize after treatment with higher NaCl concentrations (150 mM–200 mM). This study provides insights into how salinity influences the processes in the donor and acceptor sides of PSII in plants with different salt sensitivity.

Abstract Magnetic field effects on electrocatalysis have recently gained attention due to the substantial enhancement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on ferromagnetic catalysts. When detecting an enhanced catalytic activity, the effect of magnetic fields on mass transport must be assessed. In this study, we employ a specifically designed magneto-electrochemical system and non-magnetic electrodes to quantify magnetic field effects. Our findings reveal a marginal enhancement in reactions with high reactant availability, such as the OER, whereas substantial boosts exceeding 50% are observed in diffusion limited reactions, exemplified by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Direct visualization and quantification of the whirling motion of ions under a magnetic field underscore the importance of Lorentz forces acting on the electrolyte ions, and demonstrate that bubbles’ movement is a secondary phenomenon. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of magnetic fields in electrocatalysis and unveil new prospects for developing more efficient and sustainable energy conversion technologies.

Abstract Metal-support electronic interactions play crucial roles in triggering the hydrogen spillover (HSo) to boost hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It requires the supported metal of electron-rich state to facilitate the proton adsorption/spillover. However, this electron-rich metal state contradicts the traditional metal→support electron transfer protocol and is not compatible with the electron-donating oxygen evolution reaction (OER), especially in proton-poor alkaline conditions. Here we profile an Ir/NiPS 3 support structure to study the Ir electronic states and performances in HSo/OER-integrated alkaline water electrolysis. The supported Ir is evidenced with Janus electron-rich and electron-poor states at the tip and interface regions to respectively facilitate the HSo and OER processes. Resultantly, the water electrolysis (WE) is efficiently implemented with 1.51 V at 10 mA cm –2 for 1000 h in 1 M KOH and 1.44 V in urea-KOH electrolyte. This research clarifies the Janus electronic state as fundamental in rationalizing efficient metal-support WE catalysts.

The traditional electrochemical caustic soda recovery system uses the generated pH gradient across the ion exchange membrane for the regeneration of spent alkaline absorbent from CO2 capture. This electrochemical CO2 capture system releases the by-products H2 and O2 at the cathode and anode, respectively. Although effective for capturing CO2, the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limit the energy efficiency of this technique. Hence, this study proposed and validated a hybrid electrochemical cell based on the H2-cycling from the cathode to the anode to eliminate the reliance on anodic oxygen generation. The results show that our lab-scale prototype enabled effective spent caustic soda recovery with an electron utilisation efficiency of 90%, and a relative carbonate/bicarbonate diffusional flux of approximately 40%. The system also enabled the regeneration of spent alkaline absorbent with a minimum electrochemical energy input of 0.19 kWh/kg CO2 at a CO2 recovery rate of 0.7 mol/m2/h, accounting for 30% lower energy demand than a control system without H2-recycling, making this technique a promising alternative to the conventional thermal regeneration technology.

Abstract The pursuit of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in acidic media is highly desirable, albeit challenging. SrIrO 3 based perovskites are electrochemically active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, their inert activities toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) severely restrict the practical implementation in overall water splitting. Herein, an Ir@SrIrO 3 heterojunction is newly developed by a partial exsolution approach, ensuring strong metal‐support interaction for OER and HER. Notably, the Ir@SrIrO 3 ‐175 electrocatalyst, prepared by annealing SrIrO 3 in 5% H 2 atmosphere at 175 °C, delivers ultralow overpotentials of 229 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for OER and 28 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for HER, surpassing most recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. Moreover, the water electrolyzer using the Ir@SrIrO 3 ‐175 bifunctional electrocatalyst demonstrates the potential application prospect with high electrochemical performance and excellent durability in acidic environment. Theoretical calculations unveil that constructing Ir@SrIrO 3 heterojunction regulates interfacial electronic redistribution, ultimately enabling low energy barriers for both OER and HER.

The lack of highly efficient and inexpensive catalysts severely hinders the large-scale application of Zn–air batteries (ZABs). High-entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit unique structures and attractive properties; thus, they are promising to be used in ZABs. However, conventional high-temperature synthesis methods tend to obtain microscale HEOs with a lower exposure rate of active sites. Here, we report a facile solvothermal strategy for preparing two-dimensional (2D) HEO sub-1 nm nanosheets (SNSs) induced by polyoxometalate (POM) clusters. Taking advantage of the special 2D sub-1 nm structure and precise element regulation, these 2D HEOs-POM SNSs exhibit enhanced bifunctional oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction activity under light irradiation. Further applying these 2D HEOs-POM SNSs to ZABs as cathode catalysts, the CoFeNiMnCuZnOx-phosphomolybdic acid SNSs-based ZABs deliver a low charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.25 V at 2 mA cm–2 under light irradiation. Meanwhile, it could maintain an ultralong-term stability for 1600 h at 2 mA cm–2 and 930 h at 10 mA cm–2. The 2D sub-1 nm structure and fine element control in HEOs provide opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, limited active sites, and instability of air cathodes in ZABs.

Modification of oxygen evolution co-catalyst (OEC) on the surface of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) can effectively improve the kinetics of water oxidation, but it is still limited by the small hole extraction driving force at the BiVO4/OEC interface. Modulating the BiVO4/OEC interface with a hole transfer layer (HTL) is expected to facilitate hole transport from BiVO4 to the OEC surface. Herein, a copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) HTL is inserted between BiVO4 and NiFeOx OEC to create BiVO4/CuSCN/NiFeOx photoanode, resulting in a significant enhancement of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. From electrochemical analyses and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, the markedly enhanced PEC performance is attributed to the insertion of CuSCN as an HTL, which promotes the extraction of holes from BiVO4 surface and boosts the water oxidation kinetics. The optimal photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 5.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and an impressive charge separation efficiency of 96.2 %. This work offers valuable insights into the development of advanced photoanodes for solar energy conversion and emphasizes the importance of selecting an appropriate HTL to mitigate recombination at the BiVO4/OEC interface.

Ruthenium oxide (RuO2) as a promising acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers still suffers from severe excessive oxidation and Ru dissolution, leading to the loss of activity. Herein, a Sm doping in amorphous/crystalline heterophase RuO2 (AC-Sm-RuO2) catalyst is designed for boosting the acidic OER catalytic performance by altering the electronic properties and number of active sites. The representative AC-Sm-RuO2 displays robust OER performance with an overpotential of 200 mV to achieve 10 mA cm–2, and significantly enhanced stability compared to synthesized RuO2 (S-RuO2) and commercial RuO2 (Com. RuO2). Electrochemical measurements combined with advanced characterizations reveal that the high activity in AC-Sm-RuO2 originated from the symmetry-broken Ru active sites, which lowers the formation energy barrier of *OOH; meanwhile, the improved stability arises from the strong interplay within the local Ru–O–Sm units and the characteristics of the amorphous/crystalline hybrid. This work emphasizes the effective means to design high-performance acidic OER catalysts via the synergy of microstructure symmetry disturbance and crystal phase engineering.

Abstract The transition metal oxides/sulfides are considered promising catalysts due to their abundant resources, facile synthesis, and reasonable electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a significantly improved intrinsic catalytic activity is achieved for constructing a Co‐based nanocrystal (Co‐S@NC) with the coordination of Co─S, Co─S─C, and Co─N x ─C. The calculational and experimental results demonstrate that the diversified chemical environment of Co‐cations induces the transition of 3d orbitals to a high spin‐state that exhibits the coexistence of Co 2+ with fully occupied d π orbitals and Co 3+ with unpaired electrons in d π orbitals. The diverse d π orbitals occupation contributes to an elevated d‐band center of Co ions, which accelerates oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalytic kinetics of the Co‐S@NC nanocrystal. Therefore, the Li–O 2 batteries with Co‐S@NC as cathode catalyst exhibit 300 cycles at the current density of 500 mA g −1 with a cut‐off capacity of 1000 mAh g −1 . Moreover, the ultrahigh discharge specific capacity of 34 587 mAh g −1 is obtained at a current density of 1000 mA g −1 , corresponding to the energy density 949 Wh kg −1 of a prototype Li–O 2 battery. The study on 3d orbital regulation of nanocrystals provides an innovative strategy for bifunctional electrocatalysts toward the practical application of metal–air batteries.

Abstract The electrocatalytic performance of MoNi‐based nanomaterials undergo selenization has garnered significant interest due to their modified electronic structure, while still posses certain challenges for obtained bimetallic selenides. Here, a novel MoNi‐based electrocatalyst of NiMoO 4 @Mo 15 Se 19 /NiSe 2 core‐shell nanomaterials is constructed to promote the desorption of OOH * which can facilitate the water oxidation process. NiMoO 4 @Mo 15 Se 19 /NiSe 2 core‐shell nanoarrays show that the “cores” are mainly NiMoO 4 nanorods while the “shells” are the bimetallic selenides nanoflakes, which are super architectures that can expand more active sites and accelerate the electron transfer. Moreover, the hybridization interaction between Ni 3d, Mo 4d, and Se 4p orbitals leads to an asymmetric distribution of electric clouds, which decreases the adsorption energy and transformation of oxygen‐containing species. Electrochemical data displays that the overpotentials of NiMoO 4 @Mo 15 Se 19 /NiSe 2 core‐shell nanomaterials are only 195 mV, 220 mV, and 224 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline freshwater, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater. The current density decay is negligible after 100 h stability at about 1.46 V with a three‐electrode system in alkaline natural seawater. The low cost and the unique MoNi‐based bimetallic selenides in this work provide a more constructive solution for designing efficient and stable OER catalysts in the future.

The investigation of photocatalytic behavior of compounds consisting of earth-abundant elements is vital for discovering cheap photocatalysts/photoelectrocatalysts. AlFeO3 is an attractive material in this context because all its constituent elements are earth-abundant. In this work, bulk heterojunctions (heterojunctions distributed throughout the volume of powder) of AlFeO3 and ZnO were prepared using the technique of jet milling and subsequently used for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Jet milling achieved two objectives – reduction of particle size and formation of heterojunctions. Jet milling of AlFeO3 and ZnO particles was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere to produce AlFeO3/ZnO heterojunctions. Making heterojunctions by using jet milling is extremely rapid, a single jet milling operation taking only five to 10 min. The heterojunction powder sample exhibited a current density of 34.25 mA/cm2 under illumination (at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) when it was used as the working electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical cell for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). In contrast, ZnO nanoparticles prepared by jet milling (under nitrogen atmosphere) exhibited a current density of 18.54 mA/cm2 under illumination (at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Thus, AlFeO3/ZnO bulk heterojunctions showed a superior photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance as compared to ZnO nanoparticles.

Electrochemical flow cell coupled with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (EFC-ICP-MS) is a powerful electroanalytical technique to monitor in-situ dissolution of metallic electrocatalysts and to understand mechanism of degradation under operating conditions. Its utilisation has witnessed a notable increase in the electrocatalyst field in the last decade where it has been extensively used to study the stability of platinum group metals (PGMs) under oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction conditions. Online ICP-MS has allowed the scientific and industrial community to optimise the activity and stability of PGMs thanks to a better understanding of the complex metal corrosion processes. Among the different setups, the electrochemical flow cell design is the most common as it is based on a commercially available design. Nonetheless, besides different materials and different electrochemical protocols, the impact of the geometry and various parameters of the setup on the recorded dissolution signal has not been studied until now. Such parameters can influence the results obtained with an EFC-ICP-MS and thus the interpretation of the dissolution mechanism and/or stability assessment. Hereby, we demonstrate that the length of the tubing between the outlet of the cell and the inlet of the ICP-MS impacts the resolution of the PtCo catalyst dissolution peaks. This, in turn, facilitates studies where the detection of extremely low concentrations is necessary, such as under a very narrow potential window. Similarly, a reduced internal volume of the cell restricts Pt redeposition, contributing to a more precise evaluation of stability. These claims were supported by dynamic continuum mechanics modelling of the ion concentration in a model EFC. Finally, we provide guidelines and advice to properly measure dissolution with an electrochemical cell coupled with ICP-MS.

Selective oxidative cleavage of C(OH)–C or C(O)–C bonds in cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone (KA oil) to produce adipic acid (AA), a monomer for the synthesis of nylon-66, is of significant importance for the petrochemical industry. Herein, we report an electrochemical method to improve the efficiency for upgrading KA oil into AA. Free-standing electrodes consisting of hydroxides (Ni(OH)2 and Mn-doped Ni(OH)2) supported by carbon paper were fabricated via an in situ electrodeposition process and further examined for KA oil conversion. The morphology and structures of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the samples was studied by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The products of KA oil oxidation were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The introduction of manganese into nickel hydroxides enhanced the catalytic performance in terms of activity and product selectivity. Specifically, the optimal sample exhibited a current density of 50 mA mg–1 and selectivity of 46.8%, which are superior to those of pure nickel hydroxides. Such enhancement was attributed to the electronic interaction of manganese with nickel hydroxides, thereby modifying the adsorption of the substrates. Interestingly, the introduction of Mn into nickel hydroxides had negligible effects in the oxygen evolution reaction. The effects of critical parameters including substrate composition, reaction temperatures, KOH concentrations, and electrolysis time on the conversion of KA oil were investigated.

Alexandrium leei and Alexandrium catenella are noxious dinoflagellates that form red tides but the two species differ substantially in optimal growth conditions. For formation of blooms in natural environments, A. leei favors moderate temperatures (around 20 °C) while A. catenella favors much lower temperatures (around 10 °C). We examined the effects of temperature and light on cell proliferation and photosynthesis in cell cultures of the two species. Under light at 100 μmol photons m−2 s−1, the growth rate of both species was highest at 20 °C. At 25 °C, A. leei continued to proliferate but A. catenella did not survive. Conversely, at lower temperatures 12 °C and 15 °C, the growth rate of A. leei was very low while that of A. catenella remained high. The net photosynthetic activity, as determined in terms of oxygen evolution, was highest at 20 °C in A. leei. By contrast, it was highest at 15 °C in A. catenella. Illumination of cells with strong light at 1000 μmol photons m−2 s−1 decreased the activity of photosystem II (PSII), as determined in terms of Fv/Fm, in both species. In A. leei, the activity of PSII declined more rapidly at 12 °C and 15 °C than at 20 °C and 25 °C under strong light. In A. catenella, the activity of PSII declined more rapidly at 20 °C than at 12 °C and 15 °C. Thus, A. catenella appeared to be more resistant to photoinhibition of PSII at low temperatures than A. leei. In addition, the ability to repair photodamaged PSII at 12 °C and 15 °C was greater in A. catenella than that in A. leei. Thus, the tolerance of PSII to strong light and low temperatures might determine the range of temperatures that supports the formation of blooms of the two Alexandrium species.

Data published in the article 'Redox state kinetics in water-oxidation IrOx electrocatalysts measured by operando spectroelectrochemistry', https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.1c03290. Abstract: hydrous iridium oxides (IrOx) are the best oxygen evolution electrocatalysts available for operation in acidic environments. In this study, we employ time-resolved operando spectroelectrochemistry to investigate the redox states kinetics of IrOx electrocatalyst films for both water and hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Three different redox species involving Ir3+, Ir3.x+, Ir4+ and Ir4.y+ are identified spectroscopically and their concentrations are quantified as a function of applied potential. The generation of Ir4.y+ states is found to be the potential determining step for catalytic water oxidation, whilst H2O2 oxidation is observed to be driven by the generation of Ir4+states. The reaction kinetics for water oxidation, determined from the optical signal decays at open circuit, accelerate from ~ 20 s to < 0.5 s with increasing applied potential above 1.3V vs. RHE (i.e. TOFs per active Ir state increasing from 0.05 to 2 s-1). In contrast, the reaction kinetics for H2O2 are found to be almost independent of the applied potential (increasing from 0.1-0.3 s-1 over a wider potential window), indicative of a first order reaction mechanism. These spectroelectrochemical data quantify the increase of both the density of active Ir4.y+ states and the TOFs of these states with applied positive potential, resulting in the observed sharp turn on of catalytic water oxidation current. We reconcile these data with the broader literature while providing a unique kinetic insight into IrOx electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, indicating a first order reaction mechanism for H2O2 oxidation driven by Ir4+ states, and a higher order reaction mechanism involving the co-operative interaction of multiple Ir4.y+ states for water oxidation.

The intensifying global ocean deoxygenation has significant impacts on the oceanic ecological equilibrium. Gaps persist in understanding the dynamic evolution of global ocean oxygen throughout the 20th century due to the spatiotemporal sparsity of measurements and systematic biases within Earth system models. Here, we propose a novel spatiotemporal embedded artificial intelligence model that integrates diverse ocean datasets to construct a high-precision, monthly-resolved global ocean oxygen dataset spanning the past 140 years. Our quantitative analyses revealed a decline in global ocean oxygen content from 234.5 ± 0.4 Pmol in 1871 to 230.6 ± 0.4 Pmol in 2010, with a sharp drop of −1402.2 ± 173.6 Tmol per decade post-1980, attributing 98.5% of total oxygen loss in the past three decades alone. Our investigation further underscored that the critical temperature at the sea surface beyond which ocean oxygen begins to rapidly decrease is approximately 18°C. Forward-looking projections underlined the potential for a decline exceeding 10% in global ocean oxygen content relative to pre-1900 levels, under uncontrolled anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the 21st century. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of historical dynamics and future trajectories in global ocean oxygen, as well as a deeper knowledge of ocean deoxygenation and its underlying mechanisms.

Abstract Understanding causal relationships between evolution and ocean oxygenation hinges on reliable reconstructions of marine oxygen levels, typically from redox-sensitive geochemical proxies. Here, we develop a proxy, using dolomite U–Pb geochronology, to reconstruct seawater U/Pb ratios. Dolomite samples consistently give U–Pb dates and initial 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ratios lower than expected from their stratigraphic ages. These observations are explained by resetting of the U–Pb system long after deposition; the magnitude of deviations from expected initial 207 Pb/ 206 Pb are a function of the redox-sensitive U/Pb ratios during deposition. Reconstructed initial U/Pb ratios increased notably in the late-Paleozoic, reflecting an increase in oxygenation of marine environments at that time. This timeline is consistent with documented shifts in some other redox proxies and supports evolution-driven mechanisms for the oxygenation of late-Paleozoic marine environments, as well as suggestions that early animals thrived in oceans that on long time scales were oxygen-limited compared to today.

Abstract The presence of hematite (Fe2O3) clusters at low coverage on titanium dioxide (TiO2) sur-&#xD;face has been observed to enhance photocatalytic activity, while excess loading of hematite is&#xD;detrimental. We conduct a comprehensive density functional theory study of Fe2O3 clusters&#xD;adsorbed on the anatase TiO2 (101) surface to investigate the effect of Fe2O3 on TiO2. Our&#xD;study shows that TiO2 exhibits improved photocatalytic properties with hematite clusters at&#xD;low coverage, as evidenced by a systematic study conducted by increasing the number of cluster&#xD;adsorbates. The adsorption of the clusters generates impurity states in the band gap improving&#xD;light absorption and consequently affecting the charge transfer dynamics. Furthermore, the&#xD;presence of hematite clusters enhances the activity of TiO2 in the hydrogen evolution reaction.&#xD;The Fe valence mixing present in some clusters leads to a significant increase in H2 evolution rate&#xD;compared with the fixed +3 valence of Fe in hematite. We also investigate the effect of oxygen&#xD;defects and find extensive modifications in the electronic properties and local magnetism of the&#xD;TiO2 -Fe2O3 system, demonstrating the wide-ranging effect of oxygen defects in the combined&#xD;system.

Abstract Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of algae and plants harbor specialized thylakoid membranes that convert sunlight into chemical energy. These membranes house photosystems II and I, the vital protein-pigment complexes that drive oxygenic photosynthesis. In the course of their evolution, thylakoid membranes have diversified in structure. However, the core machinery for photosynthetic electron transport remained largely unchanged, with adaptations occurring primarily in the light-harvesting antenna systems. Whereas thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria are relatively simple they become more complex in algae and plants. The chloroplasts of vascular plants contain intricate networks of stacked grana and unstacked stroma thylakoids. This review provides an in-depth view of thylakoid membrane architectures in phototrophs, and the determinants that shape their forms, as well as presenting recent insights into the spatial organization of their biogenesis and maintenance. Its overall goal is to define the underlying principles that have guided the evolution of these bioenergetic membranes.    

    

## Apatite as a Record of Magmatic–Hydrothermal Evolution and Metallogenic Processes: The Case of the Hongshan Porphyry–Skarn Cu–Mo Deposit, SW China

Apatite, as a common accessory mineral found in magmatic–hydrothermal deposits, effectively yields geochemical insights that facilitate our understanding of the mineralization process. In this research, multiple generations of magmatic and hydrothermal apatite were observed in the Hongshan porphyry–skarn Cu–Mo deposit in the Yidun Terrane in SW China. The geochemical compositions of the apatite were studied using in situ laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and an electron probe microanalysis to understand the magmatic–hydrothermal processes leading to ore formation. The apatite (Ap1a) occurs as subhedral to euhedral inclusions hosted in the phenocrysts of the granite porphyry. The Ap1b occurs later than Ap1a in a fine-grained matrix that intersects the earlier phenocrysts. Increases in F/Cl, F/OH, and F/S and decreases in ΣREE and (La/Yb)N from Ap1a to Ap1b suggest the exsolution of a volatile-rich phase from the magma. The skarn hosts three types of hydrothermal apatite (Ap2a, Ap2b, and Ap3), marking the prograde, retrograde, and quartz–sulfide stages of mineralization, respectively. The elemental behaviors of hydrothermal apatite, including the changes in Cl, Eu, As, and REE, were utilized to reflect evolutions in salinity, pH, oxygen fugacity, and fluid compositions. The composition of Ap2a, which occurs as inclusions within garnet, indicates the presence of an early acidic magmatic fluid with high salinity and oxygen fugacity at the prograde skarn stage. The composition of Ap2b, formed by the coupled dissolution-reprecipitation of Ap2a, indicates the presence of a retrograde fluid that is characterized by lower salinity, higher pH, and a significant decrease in oxygen fugacity compared to the prograde fluid. The Ap3 coexists with quartz and sulfide minerals. Based on studies of Ap3, the fluids in the quartz–sulfide stage exhibit relatively reducing conditions, thereby accelerating the precipitation of copper and iron sulfides. This research highlights the potential of apatite geochemistry for tracing magmatic–hydrothermal evolution processes and identifying mineral exploration targets.

Food and other bio-waste management is an integral part of urban development and living. Composting is a common practice in most developed countries, while open burning and landfilling is widely used in waste management in low and middle income countries. The outputs of composting include compost, heat, leachate, and off-gas. The off-gas consists of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, ammonia and volatile organic compounds. The CO2, although biogenic could contribute to climate change mitigation if the emissions are controlled. CO2 sequestration using microalgae has been widely reported has been widely reported as a viable alternative to geological storage. CO2 sources in microalgal cultivation include ambient air, composting off-gas, combustion flue gas, wastewater aeration gas, syngas, and biogas. Carbon dioxide from composting can be used in controlled environment agriculture instead of commercially produced alternative, or from ambient air. This review examines the available information on composting off-gas dynamics, particularly CO2 evolution, and the challenges and prospects of CO2 use in microalgal cultivation, ensuring circularity in the composting process. This review recommends the utilization of CO2 from composting as alternative to direct air extraction. However, achieving higher CO2 concentration relative to oxygen is challenging. While efforts are made towards reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during composting, near zero oxygen concentration in the off-gas is essential to enhancing CO2 utilization in microalgae cultivation. This should be achieved without compromising compost quality such as germination index and chemical oxygen demand/heavy metals reduction efficiency.

The interest of the scientific community toward carbon-based nanostructures is justified by the wide range of applications of such multifaceted structures. In the present work, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized, in mild conditions, by using spent coffee grounds as the carbon source. Green-emitting CNPs of about 40 nm were obtained, and they were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, highlighting that they are naturally doped with N, K, Mg, and P. Such intrinsic doping promotes the characteristic green emission; furthermore, the N- and P-doping prompted us to evaluate their ability to photoproduce 1O2 for PDT applications. The presence of heteroatoms in the CNP structure was also used to electrochemically promote the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis.

Abstract The streamer dynamic evolution and discharge mode transition of three-electrode surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) driven by repetitive pulses are studied experimentally and numerically for better plasma-mode controlling and optimized application. Spatial-temporal plasma morphologic features together with electro-optical behaviors are utilized to analyze the streamer dynamic evolution and streamer-to-spark transition. To have a deep insight into the physical mechanism of the discharge mode transition in repetitive pulses, a 2D fluid model combined with 0D kinetic model is built and studied. A good agreement between experimental measurements and numerical simulation in the propagation dynamics and voltage-current characteristics is achieved. Results show that the surface-streamer discharge in the form of primary and transitional streamers can transform into a surface-spark discharge characterized with the primary streamer, transitional streamer and spark phase in repetitive pulses under the high applied electric field. A high gas temperature will result in a large reduced electric field after the transitional streamer, which exceeds the ionization threshold and thus promotes the discharge mode transition. The most electrons can be released from the negative charges by oxygen atoms during the inter-pulse period, which is favor to the re-ignition and ionization process of the subsequent pulse discharge.    

    

## Control of Steel Composition and Evolution of Inclusions During Electroslag Remelting of NiCrMoV High‐Strength Steel

Herein, the control of steel composition and evolution of inclusions during the electroslag remelting (ESR) of NiCrMoV high‐strength steel are investigated by laboratory experiments and thermodynamic calculations. The effects of slag systems, atmosphere protection, and surface quality of the consumable electrode are discussed. Results show that slag containing 5% TiO 2 and 2% SiO 2 is beneficial for controlling Ti and Si losses in steel during the ESR. Using argon gas protection reduces the total oxygen (TO) and nitrogen contents in ESR ingots and improves steel cleanliness, while it has little influence on the types of inclusions. The oxide scales on the electrode surface lead to the reoxidation of liquid steel during the ESR. The TO content increases to 113 ppm and Si, Ti, Als, and Mn contents in ESR ingots are considerably reduced. The inclusions are transformed from Al 2 O 3 –CaO–TiO x –MgO to MnO–SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 –TiO x . Thermodynamic calculations reveal that the decrease in temperature promotes the precipitation of Ca 2 Ti 2 O 5 and Ca 2 Ti 2 O 6 in inclusions. As the oxygen content from reoxidation increases, the formation of SiO 2 and MnO in inclusions in ESR ingots is promoted. Appropriate process parameters are proposed to control the composition and cleanliness of steel during the ESR.

The Earth’s surface undergoes changes over time due to various factors such as changes in climatic processes, sea level, and tectonic activity. These changes occur gradually and often go unnoticed to the human eye but are left behind as evidence in the form of sedimentary layers and erosional patterns that can be studied over geological time periods. For instance, ancient fluvial deposits are important archives of past changes and investigating their different aspects has implications for understanding past climate and landscape evolution. This doctoral thesis is focussed on the Middle Eocene (∼40 Ma) aged Escanilla Formation in the south-central Pyrenees, Spain, and is a compilation of 4 different studies. The first study documents how ancient riverbed systematically evolved from lower slopes in coarser-grained high amalgamation (HA) intervals, and higher slopes in finer-grained low amalgamation (LA) intervals. These changes were primarily driven by climate-controlled water discharge variations rather than base level changes. The second study presents a comprehensive geochemical record of the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO), a global warming event that occurred at ∼40 Ma, using a suite of sampled paleosols, fluvial stromatolites, and pedogenic nodules. Geochemical proxies include carbon and oxygen stable isotopes, weathering indices, mean annual precipitation, clumped isotope temperature and clay mineralogy. Based on the regional preservation of the MECO and the climate, this study highlights fluvial sedimentary successions as interesting terrestrial archives of past changes in global climate. The third study explores a relationship between water discharge, sediment flux variability, and changing fluvial stratigraphic architecture with results indicating that HA intervals were most likely deposited under more intermittent and short-lived, intense precipitation events, while LA intervals were the result of less intermittent flows throughout the year. These estimates are consistent with values from modern ephemeral rivers typically found in arid to semi-arid climatic conditions, and highlight the connection between hydroclimate, river morphodynamics, and landscape evolution. Finally, the fourth study, explores a potential relationship between the MECO and a continental arc flare-up as a source of pCO2. An increase in mercury content relative to the MECO likely suggests a link between the two. Collectively, these studies provide new insights into the complex dynamics of past climate and landscape evolution, and have implications for interpreting ancient sedimentary deposits such as changes in fluvial stacking patterns, highlighting the importance of fluvial sedimentary successions as key archives of past global climate evolution and perturbations.

Abstract Background Cetaceans, having experienced prolonged adaptation to aquatic environments, have undergone evolutionary changes in their respiratory systems. This process of evolution has resulted in the emergence of distinctive phenotypic traits, notably the abundance of elastic fibers and thickened alveolar walls in their lungs, which may facilitate alveolar collapse during diving. This structure helps selective exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, while minimizing nitrogen exchange, thereby reducing the risk of DCS. Nevertheless, the scientific inquiry into the mechanisms through which these unique phenotypic characteristics govern the diving behavior of marine mammals, including cetaceans, remains unresolved. Results This study entails an evolutionary analysis of 42 genes associated with pulmonary fibrosis across 45 mammalian species. Twenty-one genes in cetaceans exhibited accelerated evolution, featuring specific amino acid substitutions in 14 of them. Primarily linked to the development of the respiratory system and lung morphological construction, these genes play a crucial role. Moreover, among marine mammals, we identified eight genes undergoing positive selection, and the evolutionary rates of three genes significantly correlated with diving depth. Specifically, the SFTPC gene exhibited convergent amino acid substitutions. Through in vitro cellular experiments, we illustrated that convergent amino acid site mutations in SFTPC contribute positively to pulmonary fibrosis in marine mammals, and the presence of this phenotype can induce deep alveolar collapse during diving, thereby reducing the risk of DCS during diving. Conclusions The study unveils pivotal genetic signals in cetaceans and other marine mammals, arising through evolution. These genetic signals may influence lung characteristics in marine mammals and have been linked to a reduced risk of developing DCS. Moreover, the research serves as a valuable reference for delving deeper into human diving physiology.

This doctoral thesis is focussed on the Middle Eocene (∼40 Ma) aged Escanilla Formation in the south-central Pyrenees, Spain, and is a compilation of 4 different studies. The first study documents how ancient riverbed systematically evolved from lower slopes in coarser-grained high amalgamation (HA) intervals, and higher slopes in finer-grained low amalgamation (LA) intervals. These changes were primarily driven by climate-controlled water discharge variations rather than base level changes. The second study presents a comprehensive geochemical record of the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO), a global warming event that occurred at ∼40 Ma, using a suite of sampled paleosols, fluvial stromatolites, and pedogenic nodules. Geochemical proxies include carbon and oxygen stable isotopes, weathering indices, mean annual precipitation, clumped isotope temperature and clay mineralogy. Based on the regional preservation of the MECO and the climate, this study highlights fluvial sedimentary successions as interesting terrestrial archives of past changes in global climate. The third study explores a relationship between water discharge, sediment flux variability, and changing fluvial stratigraphic architecture with results indicating that HA intervals were most likely deposited under more intermittent and short-lived, intense precipitation events, while LA intervals were the result of less intermittent flows throughout the year. These estimates are consistent with values from modern ephemeral rivers typically found in arid to semi-arid climatic conditions, and highlight the connection between hydroclimate, river morphodynamics, and landscape evolution. Finally, the fourth study, explores a potential relationship between the MECO and a continental arc flare-up as a source of pCO2. An increase in mercury content relative to the MECO likely suggests a link between the two. Collectively, these studies provide new insights into the complex dynamics of past climate and landscape evolution, and have implications for interpreting ancient sedimentary deposits such as changes in fluvial stacking patterns, highlighting the importance of fluvial sedimentary successions as key archives of past global climate evolution and perturbations.

Abstract Lithium-rich layered oxide (LRLO) hold great promise as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, but they face challenges due to their complex electrochemical behavior and structural instability. This study proposes an analysis framework using unsupervised learning via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve the predictability and reliability of these materials. By applying PCA, we have identified key factors affecting their electrochemical performance and degradation mechanisms. This has enabled us to easily separate and elucidate oxygen and manganese redox reactions in the low-voltage range, thereby improving our understanding of how the evolution of these reactions affects the degradation of LRLO materials. The PCA-based approach proves to be highly effective in predicting performance and identifying degradation pathways, making a significant advance in the understanding and optimization of these cathodes. These findings represent a step forward in quantifying the mechanisms of electrode materials, which requires the development of models that integrate domain knowledge with data.

OVERVIEW Presented here are models for non-irradiated, substellar mass objects belonging to the Sonora model series, described in Marley et al. (2021). The files presented here are model temperature-pressure structures ("structure"), emergent spectra from the top of the atmosphere ("spectra"), thermal evolution and photometry ("evolution_and_photometry"), and rainout chemical equilibrium tables used to compute the models ("chemistry"). Atmospheric structure and spectra .tar file names specify metallicity [M/H] and carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) relative to solar. For example, "structures+0.0_co1.5.tar.gz" contains the set of radiative-convective equilibrium atmospheric structures for solar metallicity ("+0.0") with C/O=1.5 times the solar abundance. The _co*.* is omitted for solar C/O, or co_1.0. The individual file naming convention is described below. All stated abundances and ratios are relative to Lodders (2010) abundances, see Marley et al. (2021) for details and use caution when referring to other abundance tabulations. This particular set of model atmosphere structures and associated spectra, photometry, and evolution, which we name Sonora Bobcat, are for cloudless objects with 3.25 ≤ log g (cgs) ≤ 5.5 and 200 ≤ Teff ≤ 2400K. Steps in Teff vary from 25K to 1000K and steps in log g are 0.25 or 0.5. Some combinations of model grid parameters include additional values of the gravity. Models are provided for [M/H] = -0.5, 0.0, and +0.5 and "rainout" chemical equilibrium. A limited set of models with carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 0.5 and 1.5 times solar abundance are also included. For the convenience of having a rectangular table in (Teff, gravity) space, models are calculated in regimes that are not reached by the evolution, such as very high gravity and very low Teff. Refer to the companion evolution tables to identify combinations of Teff and log g outside the bounds covered by the evolution. ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE Atmospheric structure and spectra filenames specify Teff and gravity (in mks units) along with [M/H] and (C/O) relative to solar. "co1.5" in version and spectra header nomenclature refers to 1.5 times the solar C/O ratio. _co*.* is generally omitted for 1.0, the solar value. For example, the file t1000g316nc_m-0.5.dat contains the structure of a model with Teff=1000K, g=316m/s2 (the exact value of the gravity is given in the first line of the file, see below) , [Fe/H]=-0.5, and C/O=1.0 times the solar value. Temperature structure and spectra files have a one line header giving "Teff, grav(MKS), Y, f_sed, kz_min, [Fe/H], C/O, f_hole". Teff and grav are the effective temperature (K) and gravity (MKS), Y is the He mass fraction. f_sed is a cloud parameterization which is not relevant for these cloudless models and is arbitrarily given as 0.0. Likewise kz_min relates to the atmospheric eddy diffusion coefficient, which is also not relevant for these chemical equilibrium models and is arbitrarily set equal to a placeholder value that is not used in these models. [Fe/H] and C/O are the metallicity and C/O ratios as described above. [Fe/H] is identical to [M/H]. f_hole is another cloud parameter for cloudy models, not relevant to these cloudless models. Columns in the atmosphere structure files describe the atmosphere at discrete levels. Columns give: level index, P(bar), T(K), internally used check parameter, adiabatic temperature gradient (d ln T / d ln P), local temperature gradient (d ln T / d ln P), atmospheric density (g / cm3). EVOLUTION AND PHOTOMETRY Evolution and Photometry tables are described in detail in a README file included in that tar file. Evolution files connect mass, effective temperature, radius, age, gravity, and moment of inertia for these model sets. Each set of model spectra is complemented with tables of fluxes and of absolute magnitudes in a number of photometric systems commonly used in brown dwarf and exoplanet research (MKO, Keck, 2MASS, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer IRAC, etc). Fluxes and magnitudes for the full set of JWST filters is also included in separate tables. Magnitudes are computed on the Vega system (using the Vega spectrum of Bohlin & Gilliland 2004) or on the AB system (e.g. for SDSS). SPECTRA The model spectra each contain close to 362000 wavelength points. The resolving power varies with wavelength and ranges from R=6000 to 200000 but is otherwise the same for all spectra. The first line gives the model parameters in the same format as the structure files described above. This is followed by the spectrum Column 1: wavelength in µm Column 2: Eddington flux Fν in erg/cm2/s/Hz (exercise caution with factors of \(4\pi\) when comparing to the radiation flux, e.g., see Section 3.3 of Hubeny & Mihalas, "Theory of Stellar Atmospheres") The spectral fluxes are given at the top of the atmosphere and are strictly monochromatic. The model spectrum provides no information in the wavelength range between two tabulated points. Unless a spectral line or feature is well resolved, interpolation in wavelength is not advised. For comparison with data, the model spectra need to be convolved and binned to the instrumental resolution and sampling. In our experience, a minimum of 10 wavelength points is necessary to obtain a reasonable average flux over a wavelength interval. This is a rule of thumb and caution is advised, especially when comparing with high resolution data. The flux received at Earth is that given in the table scaled by (R/D)2 where R is the radius of the object (given in the companion evolution tables) and D its distance. The solar spectra and photometry are the same as those archived at https://zenodo.org/record/1309035#.YOyz4S1h2X0, which did not provide the T(P) profiles available here. CHEMISTRY We also separately include rainout chemical equilibrium tables for these same atmospheric bulk abundances. These chemistry files are described in detail by their own README file. Additional chemistry tables, beyond those used for the models presented here, are also included for completeness. Users interested in the chemical abundances of the structure models must interpolate within the matching chemistry file for the atmospheric species of interest.

Understanding the explosion mechanism and hydrodynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing quest in astronomy. The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution -- with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the $\texttt{Prometheus-HotB}$ code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling -- circumventing the difficulties of representing $^{56}$Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models -- we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium. Lastly, we turn to the NIR spectra from our models to investigate the potential of using this regime to look for the presence of He in the nebular phase.

The fine regulation of catalysts by the atomic-level removal of inactive atoms can promote the active site exposure for performance enhancement, whereas suffering from the difficulty in controllably removing atoms using current micro/nano-scale material fabrication technologies. Here, we developed a surface atom knockout method to promote the active site exposure in an alloy catalyst. Taking Cu 3 Pd alloy as an example, it refers to assemble a battery using Cu 3 Pd and Zn as cathode and anode, the charge process of which proceeds at about 1.1 V, equal to the theoretical potential difference between Cu 2+ /Cu and Zn 2+ /Zn, suggesting the electricity-driven dissolution of Cu atoms. The precise knockout of Cu atoms is confirmed by the linear relationship between the amount of the removed Cu atoms and the battery cumulative specific capacity, which is attributed to the inherent atom-electron-capacity correspondence. We observed the surface atom knockout process at different stages and studied the evolution of the chemical environment. The alloy catalyst achieves a higher current density for oxygen reduction reaction compared to the original alloy and Pt/C. This work provides an atomic fabrication method for material synthesis and regulation toward the wide applications in catalysis, energy, and others.

The single‐atom Fe‐N‐C is a prominent material with exceptional reactivity in areas of sustainable energy and catalysis research. It is challenging to obtain the dense Fe‐N4 site without the Fe nanoparticle (NPs) sintering during the Fe‐N‐C synthesis via high‐temperature pyrolysis. Thus, a novel approach is devised for the Fe‐N‐C synthesis at low temperatures. Taking FeCl2 as Fe source, a hydrogen environment can facilitate oxygen removal and dechlorination processes in the synthesis, efficiently favouring Fe‐N4 site formation without Fe nanoparticle clustering at as low as 360 °C. We shed light on the reaction mechanism about hydrogen promoting Fe‐N4 formation in the synthesis. By adjusting the temperature and duration, the Fe‐N4 structural evolution and site density can be precisely tuned to directly influence the catalytic behavior of the Fe‐N‐C material. The FeNC‐H2‐360 catalyst demonstrates a remarkable Fe dispersion (8.3 wt%) and superior acid ORR activity with a half‐wave potential of 0.85 V and a peak power density of 1.21 W cm‐2 in fuel cell.

The single‐atom Fe‐N‐C is a prominent material with exceptional reactivity in areas of sustainable energy and catalysis research. It is challenging to obtain the dense Fe‐N4 site without the Fe nanoparticle (NPs) sintering during the Fe‐N‐C synthesis via high‐temperature pyrolysis. Thus, a novel approach is devised for the Fe‐N‐C synthesis at low temperatures. Taking FeCl2 as Fe source, a hydrogen environment can facilitate oxygen removal and dechlorination processes in the synthesis, efficiently favouring Fe‐N4 site formation without Fe nanoparticle clustering at as low as 360 °C. We shed light on the reaction mechanism about hydrogen promoting Fe‐N4 formation in the synthesis. By adjusting the temperature and duration, the Fe‐N4 structural evolution and site density can be precisely tuned to directly influence the catalytic behavior of the Fe‐N‐C material. The FeNC‐H2‐360 catalyst demonstrates a remarkable Fe dispersion (8.3 wt%) and superior acid ORR activity with a half‐wave potential of 0.85 V and a peak power density of 1.21 W cm‐2 in fuel cell. This method also generally facilitates the synthesis of various high‐performance M‐N‐C materials (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Ru) with elevated single‐atom loadings.

Abstract. Iodine abundance in marine carbonates (as an elemental ratio with calcium – I:Ca) is of broad interest as a proxy for local/regional ocean redox. This connection arises because the speciation of iodine in seawater—in terms of the balance between iodate (IO3-) and iodide (I-)—is sensitive to the prevalence of oxic vs. anoxic conditions. However, although I:Ca ratios are being increasingly commonly measured in ancient carbonate samples, a fully quantitative interpretation of this proxy is hindered by the scarcity of a mechanistic and quantitative framework for the marine iodine cycle and its sensitivity to the extent and intensity of ocean deoxygenation. Here we present and evaluate a representation of marine iodine cycling embedded in an Earth system model (‘cGENIE’) against both modern and paleo observations. In this, we account for IO3- uptake and reduction by primary producers, the occurrence of ambient IO3- reduction in the water column, plus the re-oxidation of I- to IO3-. We develop and test a variety of different mechanistic relationships between IO­3- and I- against an updated compilation of observed dissolved IO­3- and I- concentrations in the present-day ocean. In optimizing the parameters controlling previously proposed mechanisms behind marine iodine cycling, we find that we can obtain broad matches to observed iodine speciation gradients in zonal surface distribution, depth profiles, and oxygen deficient zones (ODZs). We also identify alternative, equally well performing mechanisms which assume a more explicit mechanistic link between iodine transformation and environment. This mechanistic ambiguity highlights the need for more process-based studies on modern marine iodine cycling. Finally, because our ultimate motivation is to further our ability to reconstruct ocean oxygenation in the geological past, we conducted ‘plausibility tests’ of our various different model schemes against available I:Ca measurements made on Cretaceous carbonates – a time of substantially depleted ocean oxygen availability compared to modern and hence a strong test of our model. Overall, the simultaneous broad match we can achieve between modelled iodine speciation and modern observations, and between forward-proxy modelled I:Ca and geological elemental ratios supports the application of our Earth system modelling in simulating the marine iodine cycle to help interpret and constrain the redox evolution of past oceans.

Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 phosphors (0–9.0 mol%) were prepared through sol–gel combustion method. The crystal structure, morphology, chemical composition, photoluminescence (PL), afterglow and thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve of Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, PL spectroscopy, afterglow spectroscopy, and TL dosimetry. Characterizations of the PL and afterglow spectra indicate that both Tb3+ doping species and oxygen vacancies act as the luminescence center of PL whereas only Tb3+ dopant works as the luminescence center of afterglow for Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4. The green afterglow of Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 lasts for about 214 min at the optimal doping concentration of about 1.0 mol%. The profile of TL glow curve of Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 heavily depends on the doping concentration, and the evolution of the TL glow curve with doping concentration reveals that doping BaAl2O4 with Tb3+ can significantly modify the distribution of carrier traps in the phosphor. The effects of Tb3+ doping on the PL, afterglow, and TL glow curve of Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 are discussed in terms of the creation, recombination, and neutralization of defects in BaAl2O4. This work proves that doing with Tb3+ species is a general and robust strategy for endowing BaAl2O4 with highly efficient green afterglow. This "defect engineering" approach enables ultra-long afterglow for Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 when defect centers in the phosphors are optimized.

Abstract Ruthenium (Ru) loaded catalysts show high activity and selectivity for ammonia (NH 3 ) synthesis via electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO 3 − ), but their practical application is still restricted by their high cost and insufficient stability. Herein, a multi‐component electrocatalyst of Ru nanoclusters loaded on phosphorus‐doped/phosphate‐modified and oxygen vacancy (O V )‐rich Fe/Fe 3 O 4 composite nanorods (Ru@P‐Fe/Fe 3 O 4 ) to synergistically promote electrocatalytic NO 3 − reduction reaction (NO 3 − RR)‐to‐NH 3 performance via strong metal‐support interaction (SMSI) is reported. Impressively, the best Ru@P‐Fe/Fe 3 O 4 catalyst exhibits outstanding NO 3 − RR activity, selectivity, and durability in 0.1 M KNO 3 + 0.5 M KOH solution, with an NH 3 yield rate of 14.37 ± 0.21 mg NH3 h −1 cm −2 (1710.71 ± 25 mg NH3 h −1 mg Ru −1 ) at −0.75 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), an NH 3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.2% at −0.55 V vs. RHE, and a superior stability over 50 h, suppressing most of reported Fe‐based and Ru‐based electrocatalysts. The characterizations and theoretical calculations unveil that the SMSI between Ru nanoclusters and P‐Fe/Fe 3 O 4 composite nanorods can promote the generation of O V , tune the electronic structure of Ru species, and stabilize Ru nanoclusters, thereby reducing the reaction energy barrier of NO 3 − RR‐to‐NH 3 , inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, and boosting the NH 3 yield rate NH 3 FE, and stability.

This dataset was collected during the TRIple-frequency and Polarimetric radar Experiment for improving process observation of winter precipitation (TRIPEx-pol) campaign. During the campaign, three zenith pointing radars were operated at he research core facility Jülich ObservatorY for Cloud Evolution (JOYCE-CF, 50°54′31′′\,N, 6°24′49′′\,E; 111\,m above mean sea level) close to Cologne, Germany. The radars were measuring at X,Ka and W-band frequencies. For a detailed information on the campaign and the radars see von Terzi et al 2021. The dataset here is the LV2 data. That means that the original Doppler Spectra data was regridded to a common time height grid with 4s temporal and 36m spatial resolution. The Doppler spectra were also fitlered (see von Terzi et al 2021 level-0 processing). The moments were calculated directly from the LV0 dataset. The LV2 processing follows Dias-Neto et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-845-2019 ). In the LV2 processing step, the radar specific offsets were calculated using a forward simulation of rain drop size distribution from a PARSIVEL instrument which is operated at JOYCE-CF. The calibration offsets are stored in the variable rain_offset_{band} (band stands for the radar band, so X,Ka or W). Then gaseous attenuation due to nitrogen, oxygen and water vapour were calculated from temperature, pressure and humidity profiles using the CloudNet product (more detail in von Terzi et al. 2021 lvel-2 processing). The attenuation due to gas is stored in the variable pia_{band}. Furthermore, the attenuation due to liquid or ice hydrometeors with the DWR-calibration described in Dias-Neto et al. 2019. In the DWR-calibration, the X and W-band radars are calibrated with respect to the Ka-band radar in the highest part of the cloud present. In the upper parts of ice clouds, the ice particles present can be assumed to be small enough to be Rayleigh scatterers and their reflectivity should not depend on the radar frequency. The relative radar offset is calculated for each time by looking at the reflectivity differences within a moving time window of 10 minutes. The attenuation due to liquid/ice hydrometeors is stored in the offset_{band} variable. The rain_offset_{band}, pia_{band} and offset_{band} have already been added to the radar reflectivity in the files, to return to the not-offset corrected dataset, simply subtract the named offsets. The variables quality_flag_offset_{band} contains flags indicating how trustworthy the offset correction is.

ABSTRACT Lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacterium used in food fermentations and commonly found in the human gut, is known to possess a fermentative metabolism. L. lactis , however, has been demonstrated to transfer metabolically generated electrons to external electron acceptors, a process termed extracellular electron transfer (EET). Here, we investigated an L. lactis mutant with an unusually high capacity for EET that was obtained in an adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiment. First, we investigated how global gene expression had changed, and found that amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism had been affected significantly. One of the most significantly upregulated genes encoded the NADH dehydrogenase NoxB. We found that this upregulation was due to a mutation in the promoter region of NoxB, which abolished carbon catabolite repression. A unique role of NoxB in EET could be attributed and it was directly verified, for the first time, that NoxB could support respiration in L. lactis . NoxB, was shown to be a novel type-II NADH dehydrogenase that is widely distributed among gut microorganisms. This work expands our understanding of EET in Gram-positive electroactive microorganisms and the special significance of a novel type-II NADH dehydrogenase in EET. IMPORTANCE Electroactive microorganisms with extracellular electron transfer (EET) ability play important roles in biotechnology and ecosystems. To date, there have been many investigations aiming at elucidating the mechanisms behind EET, and determining the relevance of EET for microorganisms in different niches. However, how EET can be enhanced and harnessed for biotechnological applications has been less explored. Here, we compare the transcriptomes of an EET-enhanced L. lactis mutant with its parent and elucidate the underlying reason for its superior performance. We find that one of the most significantly upregulated genes is the gene encoding the NADH dehydrogenase NoxB, and that upregulation is due to a mutation in the catabolite-responsive element that abolishes carbon catabolite repression. We demonstrate that NoxB has a special role in EET, and furthermore show that it supports respiration to oxygen, which has never been done previously. In addition, a search reveals that this novel NoxB-type NADH dehydrogenase is widely distributed among gut microorganisms.

Geochemical analyses include iron-speciation, redox sensitive element and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. The sub-regional redox changes likely are reflected in the ratio of highly-reactive Fe (FeHR) to total Fe (FeT) and pyrite Fe to FeHR, in combination with redox-sensitive element enrichments (Alcott et al., 2020; Bennett and Canfield, 2020; Poulton and Canfield, 2005). Dataset samples are from outcrops in Jabal Akhdar area of northern Oman, and borehole cuttings in southern salt basins Oman (TM-6). Outcrops analyzed record an unusual complete representation of the onset of the Shuram excursion exposed along a tributary to Wadi Hajir just east of the Al Hijir village (23°12'12.0 N and 057°30'56.5 E). Samples from the South Oman Salt Basin are borehole cuttings from the TM-6 well, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO). The Shuram Formation in both sections represent the deepest water facies within sub-regional basins that where paleo-geographically separated by more than 800 km (cf. Le Guerroue et al., 2006). From the base to the top the Khufai, Shuram and Buah Formations are part of the The Nafun Group. Limestones and dolostones as part of a prograding shallow marine ramp succession represent the Khufai Formation. The lower Shuram Formation consists of Alternating beds of laminated muddy marls to calcareous mudstones with occasional combined-flow cross-laminated climbing ripples, representing a distal offshore to offshore transitional paleodepositional setting (Le Guerroue et al., 2006). The beds of the lower Shuram Formation grade up into maroon−blue-green verdigris mudstones interbedded with occasional marls and muddy silt beds with combined-flow ripples that represent the middle Shuram Formation. The upper Shuram Formation is composed of interstratified carbonate marls and mudstones where carbonate content increases up section toward the basal Buah Formation. During field work in 2015 the section was measured and sampled along the tributary to Wadi Hajir. For convenience the sub-sections are named Wadi Hajir 4, 5 and 6 (WH4-6). WH4 represents the upper part of the Khufai Formation, WH5 the lower Shuram Formation, while WH6 represent the lower part of the middle Shuram Formation. WH4 section is exposed on the southern side of the tributary canyon with a small gap of 0-1 m to the base of WH5. WH5 and WH6 represent a nearly continuous and fully exposed section on the northern side of the canyon.

Data set from Laforgia P, Bandera F, Alfonzetti E, Guazzi M. Exercise chronotropic incompetence phenotypes the level of cardiovascular risk and exercise gas exchange impairment in the general population. An analysis of the Euro-EX prevention trial. Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2020 Mar;27(5):526-535. doi: 10.1177/2047487319863506. Epub 2019 Jul 25. PMID: 31345056. This is the article: Background:  Chronotropic insufficiency (CI) is defined as the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with increased demand. Exercise CI is an established predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Aim:  The aim of this study was to evaluate how exercise CI phenotypes different levels of cardiovascular risk and how it may better perform in defining cardiovascular risk when analysed in the context of cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)-derived measures and standard echocardiography in a healthy population with variable cardiovascular risk profile. Methods:  Apparently healthy individuals (N = 702, 53.8% females) with at least one major cardiovascular risk factor (MCVRF; hypertension, diabetes, tabagism, dyslipidaemia, body mass index > 25), enrolled in the Euro-EX prevention trial, underwent CPET. CI was defined as the inability to reach 80% of the chronotropic index, that is, the ratio of peak heart rate - rest heart rate/peak heart rate - age predicted maximal heart rate (AMPHR: 220 - age), they were divided into four groups according to the heart rate reserve (<80%>) and respiratory gas exchange ratio (RER; < 1.05>) as a marker of achieved maximal performance. Subjects with a RER < 1.05 (n = 103) were excluded and the final population (n = 599) was divided into CI group (n = 472) and no-CI group (n = 177). Results:  Compared with no-CI, CI subjects were more frequently females with a history of hypertension in a high rate. CI subjects also exhibited a significantly lower peak oxygen uptake (VO2) and circulatory power and an echocardiographic pattern indicative of higher left atrial volume index and left ventricular mass index. An inverse stepwise relationship between heart rate reserve and number of MCVRFs was observed (one MCVRF: 0.71 ± 0.23; two MCVRFs: 0.68 ± 0.24, three MCVRFs: 0.64 ± 0.20; four MCVRFs: 0.64 ± 0.23; five MCVRFs: 0.57 ± 18; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis the only variable found predicting CI was peak VO2 (p < 0.05; odds ratio 0.91; confidence interval 0.85-0.97). Conclusions:  In a population of apparently healthy subjects, exercise CI is common and phenotypes the progressive level of cardiovascular risk by a tight relationship with MCVRFs. CI patients exhibit some peculiar abnormal exercise gas exchange patterns (lower peak VO2 and exercise oscillatory ventilation) and echo-derived measures (higher left atrium size and left ventricle mass) that may well anticipate evolution toward heart failure.

Hydrogen production in microchannel reactors by process intensification Junjie Chen Department of Energy and Power Engineering, School of Mechanical and Power Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, 2000 Century Avenue, Jiaozuo, Henan, 454000, P.R. China Contributor: Junjie Chen, ORCID: 0000-0001-5055-4309, E-mail address: komcjj@gmail.com In reactions under normal laboratory conditions, matter is neither created nor destroyed, and elements are not transformed into other elements. Therefore, equations depicting reactions must be balanced; that is, the same number of atoms of each kind must appear on opposite sides of the equation. The balanced equation for the iron-sulfur reaction shows that one iron atom can react with one sulfur atom to give one formula unit of iron sulfide. Chemists ordinarily work with weighable quantities of elements and compounds. For example, in the iron-sulfur equation the symbol Fe represents 55.845 grams of iron, S represents 32.066 grams of sulfur, and FeS represents 87.911 grams of iron sulfide. Because matter is not created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, the total mass of reactants is the same as the total mass of products. If some other amount of iron is used, say, one-tenth as much (5.585 grams), only one-tenth as much sulfur can be consumed (3.207 grams), and only one-tenth as much iron sulfide is produced (8.791 grams). If 32.066 grams of sulfur were initially present with 5.585 grams of iron, then 28.859 grams of sulfur would be left over when the reaction was complete. The ratio of reactants and products in a chemical reaction is called chemical stoichiometry. Stoichiometry depends on the fact that matter is conserved in chemical processes, and calculations giving mass relationships are based on the concept of the mole. One mole of any element or compound contains the same number of atoms or molecules, respectively, as one mole of any other element or compound. Energy plays a key role in chemical processes. According to the modern view of chemical reactions, bonds between atoms in the reactants must be broken, and the atoms or pieces of molecules are reassembled into products by forming new bonds. Energy is absorbed to break bonds, and energy is evolved as bonds are made. In some reactions the energy required to break bonds is larger than the energy evolved on making new bonds, and the net result is the absorption of energy. Such a reaction is said to be endothermic if the energy is in the form of heat. The opposite of endothermic is exothermic; in an exothermic reaction, energy as heat is evolved. The more general terms exoergic (energy evolved) and endoergic (energy required) are used when forms of energy other than heat are involved. A great many common reactions are exothermic. The formation of compounds from the constituent elements is almost always exothermic. Formation of water from molecular hydrogen and oxygen and the formation of a metal oxide such as calcium oxide from calcium metal and oxygen gas are examples. Among widely recognizable exothermic reactions is the combustion of fuels. Not all reactions are exothermic (or exoergic). A few compounds, such as nitric oxide and hydrazine, require energy input when they are formed from the elements. The decomposition of limestone to make lime is also an endothermic process; it is necessary to heat limestone to a high temperature for this reaction to occur. The decomposition of water into its elements by the process of electrolysis is another endoergic process. Electrical energy is used rather than heat energy to carry out this reaction. Generally, evolution of heat in a reaction favours the conversion of reactants to products. However, entropy is important in determining the favourability of a reaction. Entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which energy can be distributed in any system. Entropy accounts for the fact that not all energy available in a process can be manipulated to do work. A chemical reaction will favour the formation of products if the sum of the changes in entropy for the reaction system and its surroundings is positive. An example is burning methane. Methane has a low entropy. When methane burns, it produces ash as well as the high-entropy substances carbon dioxide gas and water vapour. The entropy of the reacting system increases during combustion. Just as important, the heat energy transferred by the combustion to its surroundings increases the entropy in the surroundings. The total of entropy changes for the substances in the reaction and the surroundings is positive, and the reaction is product-favoured.
