Electrodeposition of abundant metals to fabricate efficient and durable electrodes play a viable role in advancing renewable electrochemical energy technologies. Herein, we deposit Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF onto nickel foam (NF) to form Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF as a highly efficient electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical investigation verifies that the Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER because of its nanoflowers' open‐pore morphology, reduced overpotential (η10 = 125 mV), smaller charge transfer resistance, long‐term stability, and a synergistic effect between various components, which allows the reactants to be more easily absorbed and subsequently converted into gaseous products during the water electrolysis process. DFT calculation also reveals that the introduction of Ag (222) surface into the Co9S8 (440)‐Ni3S2 (120) system increases the electronic density of states per unit cell of a system and significantly reduces the energy barriers of intermediates for OER, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER. This study showcases the innovation of employing trimetallic nanomaterials immobilized on a conductive, continuous porous three‐dimensional network formed on a nickel foam (NF) substrate as a highly efficient catalyst for OER.

Maximization the synergistic effect of each component in transition metal-carbon complexes is expected to improve the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis for rechargeable Zn-air batteries but is still challenging. Herein, nucleobase guanine is employed as a supramolecular precursor to generate the core (FeCo alloy)-shell (carbon) structure embedded in ultrathin graphene-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (FeCo@NCNSs) via a confinement pyrolysis strategy. Thanks to the generated core-shell structure and bimetallic synergistic effect, the as-prepared FeCo@NCNSs exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, when served as the bifunctional air electrode for a practical Zn-air battery, FeCo@NCNSs exhibits a higher open-circuit voltage (1.553 V) and peak power density (197.30 mW cm-2), as well as the greatly improved long-term cyclic stability compared to the noble metal benchmarks. This work provides a promising approach to integrate various active sites for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and inspires the exploration of simple but efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.

The advancement of electrocatalysts exhibiting outstanding performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), crucial for hydrogen production, holds immense significance in addressing energy shortages and mitigating environmental pollution. In this study, a novel approach to synthesizing Co-MOF (Metal-Organic Framework) directly immobilized onto a Ni foam substrate through hydrothermal synthesis is presented. In contrast to conventional methods employing powder-based synthesis with binders, our direct attachment method offers a unique and efficient means of creating robust Co-MOF at Ni foam (Co-MOF@NF) hybrid catalysts. Subsequently, a chemical reduction approach utilizing sodium borohydride was employed to introduce surface modification into the Co-MOF structure. The resulting material, sodium borohydride treated Co-MOF@NF (Red. 1 h Co-MOF@NF), exhibited a remarkable enhancement in OER activity compared to the pristine Co-MOF@NF sample. Notably, Red.1 h Co-MOF@NF demonstrated a substantially reduced overpotential of 235 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm⁻2, in contrast to the 300 mV overpotential required by the pristine Co-MOF@NF under the same conditions. Furthermore, the Red.1 h Co-MOF@NF catalyst displayed exceptional stability, sustaining a current density of 50 mA cm⁻2 for over 48 h, highlighting its promising potential for practical applications. The synergistic effects of direct hydrothermal attachment, surface modification, and improved OER performance make this study a significant contribution to the advancement of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffers a complex four-electron process with sluggish kinetics, which severely hinders its practical application. In general, Ni-based spinel-structured materials have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for OER. However, fabricating surface with high efficient Ni3+ active sites for Ni-based spinel is thermodynamically unfavorable, which impedes the future development and application of Ni-based spinel. In this study, we have formulated a octahedral (Oh) sites doping route for the synthesis of a Ni3+-riched Ni(Co1.98Ni0.02)O4. The results demonstrate that the catalyst with high density of surface Ni3+ active sites exhibits an improved OER catalytic activity compared with NiCo2O4 and requires a low overpotential of 349 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.

The current study focuses on the synthesis, characterization and investigation of the potential applications of azo chromophore functionalized polyesters and their composites with graphene derivatives. Employing the two-step diazotization coupling reaction, diazo diol monomers are synthesized. Subsequently, the azo polyesters are prepared via low-temperature solution polycondensation of the diazo diols with diacid chloride followed by the incorporation of graphene derivatives to obtain composite materials. Characterization techniques including Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-Visible Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are employed to evaluate the chain structure, degree of crystallinity, optical properties and morphology. Further, their electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and detection ability toward heavy metal ion was evaluated. The results demonstrate enhanced catalytic and detection capabilities attributed to synergistic interactions between polymer and graphene components. This study provides significant insights into the development of efficient polymer-graphene hybrid materials, with potential applications in green chemistry and environmental monitoring.

Preparing high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with low precious metal loadings for water electrolysis applications (e.g., for green hydrogen production) is challenging and requires electrically conductive, high-surface-area, and stable support materials. Combining the properties of stable TiO2 with those of active iridium oxide, we synthesized highly active electrodes for OER in acidic media. TiO2 powders (both commercially available Degussa P-25® and hydrothermally prepared in the laboratory from TiOSO4, either as received/prepared or following ammonolysis to be converted to titania black), were decorated with IrO2 by UV photodeposition from Ir(III) aqueous solutions of varied methanol scavenger concentrations. TEM, EDS, FESEM, XPS, and XRD measurements demonstrate that the optimized version of the photodeposition preparation method (i.e., with no added methanol) leads to direct deposition of well-dispersed IrO2 nanoparticles. The electroactive surface area and electrocatalytic performance towards OER of these catalysts have been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.1 M HClO4 solutions. All TiO2-based catalysts exhibited better mass-specific (as well as intrinsic) OER activity than commercial unsupported IrO2, with the best of them (IrO2 on Degussa P-25® ΤiO2 and laboratory-made TiO2 black) showing 100 mAmgIr−1 at an overpotential of η = 243 mV. Chronoamperometry (CA) experiments also proved good medium-term stability of the optimum IrO2/TiO2 electrodes during OER.

Metal node engineering, which can optimize the electronic structure and modulate the composition of poor electrically conductive metal–organic frameworks, is of great interest for electrochemical natural seawater splitting. However, the mechanism underlying the influence of mixed-metal nodes on electrocatalytic activities is still ambiguous. Herein, a strategic design is comprehensively demonstrated in which mixed Ni and Co metal redox-active centers are uniformly distributed within NH2–Fe-MIL-101 to obtain a synergistic effect for the overall enhancement of electrocatalytic activities. Three-dimensional mixed metallic MOF nanosheet arrays, consisting of three different metal nodes, were in situ grown on Ni foam as a highly active and stable bifunctional catalyst for urea-assisted natural seawater splitting. A well-defined NH2–NiCoFe-MIL-101 reaches 1.5 A cm–2 at 360 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 0.6 A cm–2 at 295 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in freshwater, substantially higher than its bimetallic and monometallic counterparts. Moreover, the bifunctional NH2–NiCoFe-MIL-101 electrode exhibits eminent catalytic activity and stability in natural seawater-based electrolytes. Impressively, the two-electrode urea-assisted alkaline natural seawater electrolysis cell based on NH2–NiCoFe-MIL-101 needs only 1.56 mV to yield 100 mA cm–2, much lower than 1.78 V for alkaline natural seawater electrolysis cells and exhibits superior long-term stability at a current density of 80 mA cm–2 for 80 h.

TiO2 is a widely used photoelectric conversion semiconductor material. However, due to its selective absorption of ultraviolet light and high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, it exhibits poor photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. In this study, intrinsic defect titanium vacancy and semiconductor recombination agents ZnIn2S4 were introduced into an anodization‐annealed TiO2 film (TiO2 NT) to enhance the photoanode activity. The activity‐enhanced TiO2 photoanode (ZIS@TiO2 NT‐EA) was characterized by surface analyses and photoelectrochemical measurements. The results indicated that the introduction of titanium vacancies into the TiO2 NT‐EA changed its semiconductor type from n to p. After the ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles were loaded on the TiO2 NT‐EA film, the carrier concentration of the ZIS@TiO2 NT‐EA increased nearly 12 times than the pristine TiO2 NT. Due to the higher carrier separation efficiency resulting from the formation of p‐n heterojunction, the photocurrent density of the ZIS@TiO2 NT‐EA reached 3.89 mA cm‐2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, nearly 3 times higher than that of the original TiO2 NT. The maximum applied bias photon‐to‐current efficiency (ABPE) value of the ZIS@TiO2 NT EA reached 2.15% at 0.496 V vs. RHE, which is very competitive if compared with all the reported TiO2 film electrodes in the PEC water splitting application.

Bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (BMOFs) have shown a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, attributed to the synergistic effects of dual metal sites. However, the significant role of these dual-metal synergies in the OER is not yet fully understood. In this study, we employed density functional theory to systematically investigate the OER performance of NiAl- and NiFe-based BMOFs by examining all possible spin states of each intermediate across diverse external potentials and pH environments. We found that the spin state featuring a shallow hole trap state and Ni ions with a higher oxidation state serve as strong oxidizing agents, promoting the OER. An external potential-induced spin crossover was observed in each intermediate, resulting in significant changes in the overall reaction and activation energies due to altered energy levels. Combining the constant potential method and the electrochemical nudged elastic band method, we mapped the minimum free energy barriers of the OER under varied external potential and pH by considering the spin crossover effect for both NiAl and NiFe BMOFs. The results showed that NiFe exhibits better OER thermodynamics and kinetics, which is in good agreement with experimentally measured OER polarization curves and Tafel plots. Moreover, we found that the improved OER kinetics of NiFe not only is attributed to lower barriers but also is a result of improved electrical conductivity arising from the synergistic effects of Ni–Fe dual-metal sites. Specifically, replacing the second metal Al with Fe leads to two significant outcomes: a reduction in both the band gap and the effective hole mass compared to NiAl, and the initiation of super- and double-exchange interactions within the Ni–F–Fe chain, thereby enhancing electron transfer and hopping and leading to the improved OER kinetics.

Effective energy storage has now become increasingly critical as global energy demand has skyrocketed. Asymmetric supercapacitors using electrodes made of acacia wood-derived carbon doped with MnO2. A hydrothermal process was used to synthesize the AWPC/MnO2 composite. Techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, FTIR spectra, Ramman spectra, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. We looked at the electrochemical properties of the materials we made in an electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A hydrothermal synthesis approach is used to graft MnO2 wire-like nanostructures onto acacia wood-derived activated carbon. Good electrochemical performance is shown by the carbon/MnO2 hybrid composite electrode, which has high specific capacitances of 301 F g−1 at 500 mA s−1, low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1, which is attributed to the synergistic influences between MnO2 and waste biomass-produced carbon. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor operating in the voltage range of 1.8 V and exhibiting a high energy density of 25 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 450 W kg−1 demonstrates the significant potential of the activated carbon/MnO2 composite generated from synthesized biomass. The AWPC/MnO2's oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was checked to see how well the improved nanostructure could be used. The results offer a fresh perspective on the fabrication of electrochemical energy storage devices with outstanding performance.

Abstract In this study, we have investigated the synthesis of supported iridium oxide (IrO x ) nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrolysis in a surfactant-free aqueous bath as a possible route for the large-scale production of highly active electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic water electrolyzers. The process involves (i) formation of Ir-hydroxides complex from an Ir precursor in basic media followed by (ii) protonation in acidic media to form colloidal hydrated IrO x NPs and (iii) conversion and deposition of IrO x NPs on the surface of carbon or TiN support by probe sonication. The IrO x NPs produced through hydrolysis route form highly stable colloidal solution. Since it is essential to precipitate the catalyst NPs from the colloidal solution for their use in water electrolyzer electrode development, here, we investigate the optimal reaction conditions, e.g., pH, temperature, time, and presence of support, for efficient synthesis of the catalyst NPs. The reaction intermediates formed at different reaction steps are explored to get insights into the chemistry of the process. Under the optimal synthesis conditions, 100% precipitation of IrO x NPs was achieved. Further, the precipitated TiN supported IrO x NPs exhibited high OER activity, superior to that of the commercial benchmark IrO 2 electrocatalyst. The study provides a scalable synthesis route for highly active, low Ir-content OER electrocatalysts for acidic water electrolyzers. Graphical Abstract

The exploration of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high activity and acceptable price is essential for water splitting to hydrogen generation. High-entropy materials (HEMs) have aroused increasing interest in the field of electrocatalysis due to their unusual physicochemical properties. In this work, we reported a novel FeCoNiMoZn-OH high entropy hydroxide (HEH)/nickel foam (NF) synthesized by a facile pulsed electrochemical deposition method at room temperature. The FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH displays a 3D porous nanosheet morphology and polycrystalline structure, which exhibits extraordinary OER activity in alkaline media, including much lower overpotential (248 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope (30 mV dec−1). Furthermore, FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH demonstrates excellent OER catalytic stability. The enhanced catalytic performance of the FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH primarily contributed to the porous morphology and the positive synergistic effect between Mo and Zn. This work provides a novel insight into the design of HEMs in catalytic application.

ABSTRACT. There is a growing need to develop catalysts based on non-precious metals for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the various catalysts comprising multiple transition metals, nickel (Ni)-iron (Fe) selenides have gained considerable attention due to their promising catalytic activity, attributed to their distinct metal-like characteristics. Although a lot of studies have focused on the dissolution of selenium (Se) under alkaline OER conditions and its consequent in-situ reconstructing impact, little attention has been paid to the possible involvement of Se itself in OER. In this work, we focus on the small amounts of Se residues that remain after dissolution. Our findings suggest that the quantity of these residues directly influences the OER activity of the Fe active sites within NiFe selenides. These residues are presented on the surface in the form of SeOx.

Unraveling the catalyst surface structure and behavior during reactions is essential for both mechanistic understanding and performance optimization. Here we report a phenomenon of facet-dependent surface restructuring intrinsic to β-Ni(OH)2 catalysts during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), discovered by the correlative ex situ and operando characterization. The ex situ study after OER reveals β-Ni(OH)2 restructuring at the edge facets to form nanoporous Ni1–xO, which is Ni deficient containing Ni3+ species. Operando liquid transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy further identify the active role of the intermediate β-NiOOH phase in both the OER catalysis and Ni1–xO formation, pinpointing the complete surface restructuring pathway. Such surface restructuring is shown to effectively increase the exposed active sites, accelerate Ni oxidation kinetics, and optimize *OH intermediate bonding energy toward fast OER kinetics, which leads to an extraordinary activity enhancement of ∼16-fold. Facilitated by such a self-activation process, the specially prepared β-Ni(OH)2 with larger edge facets exhibits a 470-fold current enhancement than that of the benchmark IrO2, demonstrating a promising way to optimize metal-(oxy)hydroxide-based catalysts.

The utilization of water electrolysis for green hydrogen (H2) production, powered by renewable energy, is a promising avenue for sustainable development. Proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) stands out as one of the most efficient H2 production technologies. However, implementing it on an industrial scale faces substantial challenges, particularly regarding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER, a critical process with inherently slow kinetics requiring additional potential, significantly influences overall water-splitting efficiency. Most OER electrocatalysts in PEMWE struggle with poor stability in harsh acidic environments at high oxidative potentials. While rare-earth metal oxides, such as iridium or ruthenium oxides, offer stability in commercial oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts (OECs), their use depends on achieving economically and sustainably viable operations. An alternative approach involves developing low- or non-noble metal-based OECs with sustaining high activity and long-term durability. Although such materials currently exhibit lower activity and stability than noble-based OECs, notable progress has been made in enhancing their performance. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in designing acidic-stable OECs based on low or without noble metal contents. It delves into the thermodynamics and degradation mechanisms of OECs in acidic media, evaluation parameters for activity and stability, strategies for developing active and acid-stable OECs, and the challenges and opportunities of acid water electrolysis. Through a detailed analysis of these aspects, the review aims to identify opportunities for engineering actively durable OECs.

<p>Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can convert renewable energy into hydrogen through water electrolysis. Identifying stable and active single-atom catalysts (SACs) for OER under acidic conditions holds great promise for developing cost-effective and efficient energy storage solutions, but challenging due to the vast number of potential material compositions and diverse surface morphologies. Here, to accelerate new discoveries, we present a high-throughput screening (HTS) framework that leverages the power of machine learning (ML) and density functional theory (DFT). The proposed framework includes an assessment of both the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of support surfaces. In addition, the integration of ML and uncertainty quantification for predicting the binding energies dramatically reduces the computational cost (by over a factor of 10), facilitating the identification of catalytically active SACs. Following the proposed scheme, we suggest 14 new promising SACs for OER across the 795 binary oxide supports and 21 transition metal atom combinations. These catalysts are found to break the scaling relation due to the enhanced *OOH binding with the support, which arises from favorable hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>

Abstract Understanding the structure‐activity correlation is an important prerequisite for the rational design of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts at the atomic level. However, the effect of coordination environment on electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains enigmatic. In this work, the regulation of proton transfer involved in water oxidation by coordination engineering based on Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2 and CoHPO 4 is reported. The HPO 4 2− anion has intermediate p K a value between Co(II)‐H 2 O and Co(III)‐H 2 O to be served as an appealing proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) induction group. From theoretical calculations, the pH‐dependent OER properties, deuterium kinetic isotope effects, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Raman studies, the CoHPO 4 catalyst beneficially reduces the energy barrier of proton hopping and modulates the formation energy of high‐valent Co species, thereby enhancing OER activity. This work demonstrates a promising strategy that involves tuning the local coordination environment to optimize PCET steps and electrocatalytic activities for electrochemical applications. In addition, the designed system offers a motif to understand the structure‐efficiency relationship from those amino‐acid residue with proton buffer ability in natural photosynthesis.

NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) with abundant heterostructures represents a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, NiFe LDH/Fe2O3 nanosheet arrays have been fabricated by facile combustion of corrosion-engineered NiFe foam (NFF). The in situ grown, self-supported electrocatalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 248 mV for the OER at 50 mA cm–2, a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec–1, and excellent durability over 100 h under the industrial benchmarking 500 mA cm–2 current density. A balanced Ni and Fe composition under optimal corrosion and combustion contributed to the desirable electrochemical properties. Comprehensive ex-situ analyses and operando characterizations including Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTACV) and in situ Raman demonstrate the beneficial role of modulated interfacial electron transfer, dynamic atomic structural transformation to NiOOH, and the high-valence active metal sites. This study provides a low-cost and easy-to-expand way to synthesize efficient and durable electrocatalysts.

Reasonable design and development of non-precious metal Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with high efficiency, low cost and stability are of great significance for electrocatalytic water splitting. The unique molecular structure and exceptional properties of polyoxometalates (POMs) have caught significant attention from the scientific community. Herein, CoMo-POM@IF nanoflowers has been successfully synthesized by facile etching iron foam (IF) at room temperature using polyoxometalates (POMs) as a precursor. POMs as a carbon-free metal-oxygen clusters with unique structural characteristics can be uniformly nucleated at room temperature, which can not only enable efficient green synthesis, but also provide a clear source of catalytic activity. CoMo-POM@IF catalysts with perfect nanoflake layer structure are obtained with the optimal reaction time, and the embedding of POM nanoparticles increased the surface roughness to expose more active sites. The embedding of POMs nanoparticles increases the surface roughness and electrochemically active area, showing great advantages in OER. An overpotential of 282 mV is measured at a current density of 10 mA·cm-2 in 1 M KOH, showing long-term electrochemical stability. The green synthesis of POMs electrocatalyst provides great ideas for the development of room temperature oxygen evolution electrocatalyst and speeds up the development of OER electrocatalyst in the actual production.

Development of cost-effective catalysts that provide low overpotentials and enhanced electrochemical kinetics is a critical goal of contemporary research on electrochemical water splitting and similar technologically significant processes. Translation to practical applications demands that they should also enable high current densities to be ex-tracted. A simple strategy of encapsulating the active electrocatalyst in hydrogel polymer matrices is shown to provide a solution in several respects, especially regarding the last criterion. The concept is illustrated using two examples of ‘gelectrodes’ based on nanocomposites of cobalt oxyhydroxide and nickel-iron hydroxide with chitosan on nickel foam, and their efficient mediation of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Comparison with various control systems show that significantly lower overpotentials and higher current densities with extended temporal stability can be achieved with the gelectrodes; the cobalt oxyhydroxide - chitosan and nickel-iron hydroxide - chitosan systems provide stable current densities up to 1.6 - 1.7 A cm-2 for the OER with alkaline aqueous electrolyte. This simple design strategy is expected to open up a general route to technologically useful electrocatalyst performance.

Abstract Catalysts for zinc‐air batteries (ZABs) must be stable over long‐term charging‐discharging cycles and exhibit bifunctional catalytic activity. In this study, by doping nitrogen‐doped carbon (NC) materials with three metal atoms (Fe, Ni, and Cu), a single‐atom‐distributed FeNiCu‐NC bifunctional catalyst is prepared. The catalyst includes Fe(Ni‐doped)‐N 4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Fe(Cu‐doped)‐N 4 for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and the NiCu‐NC catalytic structure for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the nitrogen‐doped carbon nanoparticles. This single‐atom distribution catalyst structure enhances the bifunctional catalytic activity. If a trimetallic single‐atom catalyst is designed, it will surpass the typical bimetallic single‐atom catcalyst. FeNiCu‐NC exhibits outstanding performance as an electrocatalyst, with a half‐wave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 0.876 V versus RHE, overpotential ( E j = 10 ) of 253 mV versus RHE at 10 mA cm −2 , and a small potential gap ( ΔE = 0.61 V). As the anode in a ZAB, FeNiCu‐NC can undergo continuous charge‐discharged cycles for 575 h without significant attenuation. This study presents a new method for achieving high‐performance, low‐cost ZABs via trimetallic single‐atom doping.

Abstract Direct electrolysis of seawater to generate hydrogen is an attractive approach for storing renewable energy. However, direct seawater splitting suffers from low current density and limited operating stability, which severely hinders its industrialization. Herein, a promising strategy is reported to obtain a nano needle‐like array catalyst‐CDs‐Mn‐Co x P on nickel foam, in which the Mn─O─C bond tightly binds Mn, Carbon dots (CDs), and Co x P together. The coordination engineering of CDs and Mn not only effectively regulates the electronic structure of Co x P, but also endows the as‐prepared catalyst with selectivity and marked long‐term stability at ampere‐level current density. Low overpotentials of 208 and 447 mV are required to achieve 1000 mA cm −2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in simulated seawater, respectively. Cell potentials of 1.78 and 1.86 V are needed to reach 500 and 1000 mA cm −2 in alkaline seawater along with excellent durability for 350 h. DFT studies have verified that the introduction of Mn and CDs effectively shifts the d‐band center of Co‐3d toward higher energy, thereby strengthening the adsorption of intermediates and enhancing the catalytic activity. This study sheds light on the development of highly effective and stable catalysts for large‐scale seawater electrolysis.

Abstract As a promising alternative to Ir based acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, Ru suffers from severe fading issues. Supporting it on robust oxides such as TiO2 is a simple and effective way to enhance its lifetime. Here, we find that a simple reduction-oxidation process can further improve both activity and stability of RuO2-TiO2 composites at high potentials. In this process, the degree of oxidation was carefully controlled to form Ru/RuO2 heterostructure to improve OER activity. Moreover, due to the oxophilicity difference of Ru and Ti, the structure of catalysts was changed from supported to embedded, which enhanced the protective effect of TiO2 and mitigated the dissolution of Ru element in acidic electrolyte, making as-prepared Ru/RuO2-TiO2 with better durability at all tested potentials.

Ozonation water treatment technology has attracted increasing attention due to its environmental benign and high efficiency. Rutile PbO2 is a promising anode material for electrochemical ozone production (EOP). However, the reaction mechanism underlying ozone production catalyzed by PbO2 was rarely studied and not well‐understood, which was in part due to the overlook of the electrochemistry‐driven formation of oxygen vacancy (OV) of PbO2. Herein, we unrevealed the origin of the EOP activity of PbO2 starting from the electrochemical surface state analysis using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, activity analysis, and catalytic volcano modeling. Interestingly, we found that under experimental EOP potential (i.e., a potential around 2.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), OV can still be generated easily on PbO2 surfaces. Our subsequent kinetic and thermodynamic analyses show that these OV sites on PbO2 surfaces are highly active for the EOP reaction through an interesting atomic oxygen (O*)‐O2 coupled mechanism. In particular, rutile PbO2(101) with the “in‐situ” generated OV exhibited superior EOP activities, outperforming (111) and (110). Finally, by catalytic modeling, we found that PbO2 is close to the theoretical optimum of the reaction, suggesting a superior EOP performance of rutile PbO2. All these analyses are in good agreement with experimental observations.

The continuous dissolution and oxidation of active sites in Ru-based electrocatalysts have greatly hindered their practical application in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). In this work, we first used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the dissolution energy of Ru in the 3d transition metal-doped MRuOx (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) to evaluate their stability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and screen out ZnRuOx as the best candidate. To confirm the theoretical predictions, we experimentally synthesized these MRuOx materials and found that ZnRuOx indeed displays robust acidic OER stability with a negligible decay of η10 after 15 000 CV cycles. Of importance, using ZnRuOx as the anode, the PEMWE can run stably for 120 h at 200 mA cm–2. We also further uncover the stability mechanism of ZnRuOx, i.e., Zn atoms doped in the outside of ZnRuOx nanocrystal would form a "Zn-rich" shell, which effectively shortened average Ru–O bond lengths in ZnRuOx to strengthen the Ru–O interaction and therefore boosted intrinsic stability of ZnRuOx in acidic OER. In short, this work not only provides a new study paradigm of using DFT calculations to guide the experimental synthesis but also offers a proof-of-concept with 3d metal dopants as RuO2 stabilizer as a universal principle to develop high-durability Ru-based catalysts for PEMWE.

Transition metal tungstates (TMTs) possess a wolframite-like lattice structure and preferably form via an electrostatic interaction between a divalent transition metal cation (MII) and an oxyanion of tungsten ([WO4]2–). A unit cell of a TMT is primarily composed of two repeating units, [MO6]oh and [WO6]oh, which are held together via several M−μ2–O–W bridging links. The bond character (ionic or covalent) of this bridging unit determines the stability of the lattice and influences the electronic structure of the bulk TMT materials. Recently, TMTs have been successfully employed as an electrode material for various applications, including electrochemical water splitting. Despite the wide electrocatalytic applications of TMTs, the study of the structure–activity correlation and electronic factors responsible for in situ structural evolution to electroactive species during electrochemical reactions is still in its infancy. Herein, a series of TMTs, MIIWVIO4 (M = Mn/Fe/Co/Ni), have been prepared and employed as electrocatalysts to study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions and to scrutinize the role of transition metals in controlling the energetics of the formation of electroactive species. Since the [WO6]oh unit is common in the TMTs considered, the variation of the central atom of the corresponding [MO6]oh unit plays an intriguing role in controlling the electronic structure and stability of the lattice under anodic potential. Under the OER conditions, a potential-dependent structural transformation of MWO4 is noticed, where MnWO4 appears to be the most labile, whereas NiWO4 is stable up to a high anodic potential of ∼1.68 V (vs RHE). Potential-dependent hydrolytic [WO4]2– dissolution to form MOx active species, traced by in situ Raman and various spectro-/microscopic analyses, can directly be related to the electronic factors of the lattice, viz., crystal field splitting energy (CFSE) of MII in [MO6]oh, formation enthalpy (ΔHf), decomposition enthalpy (ΔHd), and Madelung factor associated with the MWO4 ionic lattice. Additionally, the magnitude of the Löwdin and Bader charges on M of the M−μ2–O–W bond is directly related to the degree of ionicity or covalency in the MWO4 lattice, which indirectly influences the electronic structure and activity. The experimental results substantiated by the computational study explain the electrochemical activity of the TMTs with the help of various structural and electronic factors and bonding interactions in the lattice, which has never been realized. Therefore, the study presented here can be taken as a general guideline to correlate the reactivity to the structure of the inorganic materials.

This research offers novel ideas for development a new class of materials with enhanced OER kinetics utilizing an easy electrochemical deposition technique. Here, the Ti/CoNiyOx/FeOOH electrocatalyst was prepared in two steps. First, CoNiyOx thin film was anodically electrodeposited on an activated titanium substrate. Then iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) nanosheets were cathodically electrodeposited on the first layer. The properties of this electrocatalyst was evaluated and compared with some monolayer electrocatalysts using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Raman, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical methods. The Ti/CoNiyOx/FeOOH electrode requires an overpotential less than 330 mV at 100 mA/cm2 with Tafel constant of only 23.7 mV/dec for OER. The Ti/CoNiyOx/FeOOH electrode delivered long-term electrochemical stability in a solution containing corrosive chloride ions for more than 90 h at a constant current density of 100 mA/cm2 (with less than 9 % potential increase). Overall seawater splitting using the synthesized Ti/CoNiyOx/FeOOH electrode was performed at a current density of 100 mA/cm2 by a voltage as low as 1.58 V. The exceptional activity was ascribed to the synergistic effects of high electrochemical active sites and appropriate charge transfer ability found in CoNiyOx/FeOOH junction.

Developing nonprecious metallic electrocatalysts for water splitting is of vital importance for sustainable environment and energy technologies. As for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), FeCo‐based bimetallic catalysts have been found to act as promising candidates owing to their high intrinsic activity. Herein, a novel FeCo‐oxalate organic framework was grown on nickel foam (FeCo‐OA@NF) under mild conditions. The optimized electrocatalyst shows good OER performance with a low overpotential of 275 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline environment, comparable to that of commercial Ru‐based catalyst. Moreover, the quantification of produced oxygen by both gas chromatography and drainage method demonstrates nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. Except for the contribution of Fe and Co species for the excellent OER catalytic activity, in‐situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the positive effect of oxalate coordination also makes a difference, which can possibly reduce electron transport resistance and provide more active sites. This work provides a promising approach for the preparation of alkaline oxygen evolution electrocatalysts with low‐cost and high performance.

Developing of highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution is one of the most important issues for water splitting. It is widely accepted that Fe sites can act as active centers for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution. Herein, an amine-mediated strategy was used to induce the reconstruction of nanoscale Prussian blue analogue. The nanoscale cubes of Prussian blue analogue can be etched by amine ligand, inducing the formation of hollow structure and small sized pieces. In the etching process, Fe-based species in situ preferentially loads on the surface of newly generated units, which can expose more iron sites and thus promotes the electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution. The optimized catalyst exhibits an incredibly low overpotential of 257 mV at 10 mA·cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 44.1 mV dec-1 with remarkable stability in alkaline solution. After OER operation, Ni-doped FeOOH with thin sheet-like structure was formed on the surface of catalyst particles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirms the key role of Fe active sites in the OER process, and that the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe sites modulates the adsorption behavior of intermediates and so results in enhanced activity. This work provides an efficient strategy for advanced oxygen evolution catalysts towards electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

A micron-sized long-afterglow material, Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu,Ce, was utilized to conduct the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, two half-reactions of water splitting, in the presence of sacrificial agents under both light and dark conditions for the first time. The as-synthesized Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu,Ce exhibited higher photocatalytic activity compared to that of the referenced Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu and Sr2MgSi2O7:Ce samples. Herein, in addition to benefiting from the long photogenerated carrier lifetime of long-afterglow materials, the higher photocatalytic activity was attributed to the conjugated electronic structure between Eu and Ce ions. This structure facilitates charge and energy transfer between them, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. This research provides a new strategy for designing efficient long-afterglow material photocatalysts through the construction of conjugated electronic structures.

Clean and renewable energy is generally localized and intermittent. Thus, energy conversion and storage technologies are necessary to compensate for these shortcomings. Electrolytic water splitting presents a reliable and promising energy technology for producing high purity hydrogen (H2). Among the platinum metals, ruthenium (Ru) has gained significant attentions as it generally outperforms commercial catalysts in terms of activity at a more affordable price. Although great progress has been made in improving the catalytic activity of Ru-based catalysts, stability remains a major challenge hindering their practical applications. To this end, this review introduces the fundamentals of the stability over Ru-based catalysts for water splitting, including the reaction mechanisms of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), measurement methods and evaluation criteria, as well as deactivation mechanisms. Moreover, the up-to-date advances of representative strategies for improving HER and OER stability of Ru-based catalysts are further discussed with respect to specific design principles and underlying mechanisms. Ultimately, insights into the challenges and opportunities for Ru-based electrocatalysts are provided to promote the development of next-generation Ru-based catalysts with exceptional stability. This review aims at guiding the design and synthesis of superior catalysts, generating increased interest among researchers, and stimulating further advanced research.

The in-situ generated oxyanions at electrochemically reconstructed catalysts from metal-based non-oxide compounds have been proven to significantly accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. However, it remains a challenge to retain these self-released oxyanions at reconstructed catalysts, hindering its utilization as a tool to develop efficient OER catalysts. Here, we demonstrate a versatile self-transformed carbonate regulation strategy to efficiently retain the self-released chalcogenate at Co oxyhydroxides reconstructed from carbon-incorporated Co selenides under OER conditions. These self-transformed CO32− can induce electron accumulation and narrow d bond at Co sites to facilitate the Co 3d–O 2p orbital hybridization between Co sites and SeOx2− for enhanced SeOx2− retention, which can accelerate the rate-limiting step for *OOH formation during OER. Relative to CoOOH-SeOx2− with limited SeOx2− residues, CoOOH-CO32−/SeOx2− with elevated SeOx2− retention by CO32− regulation exhibited a 5.6-fold increase in current density and a remarkable lower Tafel slope towards OER. This strategy paves a rational avenue to design efficient catalysts for electrooxidation reactions through finely regulating self-released oxyanions at reconstructed structures.

In this work, we examine carbonization of natural product derived thermoset polymer by CO2 laser-assisted direct-write transient pyrolysis process without and with the addition of nickel salt for possible catalytic intervention. We find that nickel indeed plays an interesting and crucial role in significantly enhancing the graphene content in the laser processed sample (Ni-LIG) retaining its few monolayer character. The unique and significant advantages of laser induced transient pyrolysis process are: a) it is a direct write process enabling in-process functionality patterning, if needed, b) it is highly energy economic because energy is localized and directed to the desired process zone, c) being a transient process it can be implemented under ambient conditions, and d) it creates distinctly different microstructure as compared to furnace annealing. It was further observed that upon incorporation of the Ni-(CH3COO)2.4H2O salt in the polymer the LIG process reduces it to Ni (111), which in turn catalyses the nucleation process and lowers the activation barrier for graphene formation by annealing the defects. Moreover, due to the very low lattice mismatch between Ni (111) and graphene facilitates its high growth quality. The concurrent decoration of Ni/NiO on graphene is also shown to promote water dissociation as well as adsorption of water oxidation intermediates. This leads to an impressive value of the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA/cm2 of only 290 mV in 1M KOH. Additionally, the catalytic capacity and structure remain stable after 30 h of continuous work in 1M KOH.

The rational design and advancement of highly efficient and readily available bifunctional electrocatalysts are crucial in pursuing renewable-energy-driven electrocatalytic water splitting as a potential strategy for clean hydrogen generation. Researchers have increasingly focused on transition-metal carbides (MXenes) in the past decade due to their distinctive properties, particularly their potential as cocatalysts in electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we have presented a method for surface modification of V2CTx MXene to create an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for water-splitting applications. The desired results are achieved through the intercalation of rare earth element Sm (samarium) with V2CTx MXene by the sonochemical method. The anchoring of samarium on the surface of two-dimensional MXene served as a conductive medium, and their extensive interfacial effects enabled the fast transportation of ions by creating short and conductive channels at the electrode–electrolyte interface by exposing more active sites. The OER and HER electrocatalytic activity of the electrode material was investigated by using a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The results showed that the Sm@V2CTx nanocomposite (referred to as V1) exhibited exceptional performance for the OER with an overpotential of 350 mV (vs RHE) delivered at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 100 mV/dec. For HER, the system is capable of delivering an overpotential of 236 mV (vs RHE) and fast kinetics, having a Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability for over 14 h. This research showcases the capability of earth-abundant MXene materials and the modification of their electrocatalytic activity to act as a foundation for creating a broad range of high-performance, environmentally sustainable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts.

CoFe 2 O 4 –La 1− x Sr x CoO 3 ( x = 0.2, 0.6, 0.8) composites have been synthesized using a two‐step, low‐temperature wet chemical approach that combines coprecipitation and sol–gel techniques. The composite materials have been physicochemically analyzed using Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope. The electrocatalytic properties of the composite materials have been assessed in terms of their performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline medium. Cyclic voltammetry has been used for analyzing the redox behavior of the materials in 1 M KOH solution. The electrocatalytic activity of the materials has been assessed using anodic polarization curves on Ni substrate and the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode demonstrates excellent activity, with current densities of 11.1 mA cm −2 for OER and 47.4 mA cm −2 for MOR at 650 mV. Also, the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode has the maximum specific activity of 1.1 × 10 3 mA cm −2 g −1 at 650 mV toward OER. The electrodes’ stability has been assessed through chronoamperometric experiments and additional insight into the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity gained through the electrochemical surface area estimations using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. From chronoamperometric experiment, it has been observed that the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode attains stability within 114 s with a current density of 108.7 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters, including the standard enthalpy of activation (Δ H ° # ), standard entropy of activation (Δ S ° # ), and standard electrochemical energy of activation (), have been estimated by anodic polarization curve recorded in KOH as well as KOH with CH 3 OH solutions at various temperatures.

Oxygen had a profound effect on the evolution. In the beginning life on Earth emerged in an oxygen-free environment. Around 2.7 billion years ago, photosynthetic cyanobacteria started to produce oxygen. This caused a mass extinction of anaerobic organisms, except some bacteria that used oxygen for energy production. According to the endosymbiotic theory, the mitochondria of eukaryotes derive from such bacteria; the chloroplasts of plants are descendants of cyanobacteria. During the Cambrian "explosion" about 500 million years ago, rising oxygen levels enabled the evolution of complex animals. In later periods, fluctuations of atmospheric oxygen levels contributed to animal terrestrialization and mass extinction events, and facilitated the evolution of large insects and dinosaurs.

Abstract Lattice oxygen loss from transition metal oxide cathodes in Li-ion batteries (LiBs) is a key factor responsible in their gradual capacity decline over time. Understanding and mitigating this phenomenon is crucial for the development of next-generation LiBs. The effect of various parameters on lattice oxygen loss, such as cathode chemical composition, has been studied extensively. However, there is a lack of experimental investigation into the lattice oxygen stability across different crystallographic facets within the same cathode composition. Here, we employed in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to investigate oxygen evolution from preferentially faceted, electrodeposited LiCoO2 cathodes. Samples predominantly exposing the (003) basal planes and the (101), (102), (110) fast Li-ion diffusing facets exhibited oxygen evolution at potentials exceeding 3.5 V vs Li+/Li. Finite element simulations helped quantify the flux of oxygen evolution on the first charge cycle to 33±5 pmol/cm2s for the basal plane and 37±9 pmol/cm2s for the faceted samples at potentials above 4 V based on single spot measurements. However, spatially resolved measurements showed that faceted samples exhibited significant heterogeneity in their oxygen evolution, reaching twofold values compared to the basal plane samples at potentials beyond 4.5 V.

Anionic redox chemistry enables extraordinary capacity for Li- and Mn-rich layered oxides (LMROs) cathodes. Unfortunately, irreversible surface oxygen evolution evokes the pernicious phase transition, structural deterioration, and severe electrode-electrolyte interface side reaction with element dissolution, resulting in fast capacity and voltage fading of LMROs during cycling and hindering its commercialization. Herein, a redox couple strategy is proposed by utilizing copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) to address the irreversibility of anionic redox. The Cu-N synergistic effect of CuPc could not only inhibit surface oxygen evolution by reducing the peroxide ion O

The effect of different valence states Vo on the photo(electro)catalytic performance of the 2D TiO2:N system was investigated using the GGA+U method with first principles. In the poor oxygen conditions, the Ef values of 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0/Vo1+/Vo2+) systems are all less than zero, and all of them are exothermic. Photocatalytic investigations revealed that among the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo1+), 2D Ti24O46N (Vo2+), and 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) systems, the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system has the best carrier activity, the longest electron–hole lifetime, prominent visible light, infrared light redshift, and outstanding oxidation ability. The photocatalytic decomposition of water and oxygen evolution is highly advantageous. Electrocatalytic studies showed that compared with the free energy of 2D Ti24O46N (Vo1+) and 2D Ti24O46N (Vo2+) systems the free energy ΔGH* of the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system is −0.156 eV and the smallest, which is conducive to hydrogen evolution. The overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction is 0.360 V, which is close to zero, and the four reaction processes are all downward, indicating that the OER reaction can be driven independently by the photogenerated holes, which is conducive to the electrocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the ability of decomposing water is relatively good. The 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system is a candidate nanomaterial and can be applied as a novel photoelectric catalyst.

Developing RuO2-based electrocatalysts with high activity and stability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable but remains a challenge. More critically, strategies for rational manipulation of the reaction pathway of RuO2 from a kinetically favorable but unstable lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) pathway to an adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway are still elusive. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ce-doped RuO2 catalysts with the existence of oxygen vacancies (Ce-RuO2-x). Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ru valence state is lowered with the formation of Ce-O-Ru local structure, and Ru-O covalency is decreased, which suppress the surface Ru demetallation and lattice oxygen loss, resulting in greatly enhanced durability toward acidic OER. Moreover, the synergistic effect between Ce-O-Ru local structure and oxygen vacancies can be conducive to the stabilization of OOH∗, leading to a manipulated reaction pathway from LOM to AEM and reduced energy barrier of the rate-determining step.

Abstract Unitized regenerative fuel cells have emerged as promising energy conversion and storage systems for various applications. However, in order to optimize their efficiency, it is crucial to enhance the performance of the bifunctional catalyst. This study aims to provide deeper insights into the electrochemical behavior and performance of the bifunctional catalyst. Several electrocatalysts were prepared and evaluated using rotating disc electrode measurements. The primary focus was placed on investigating the interaction between Pt, Ir, and the support material, antimony doped tin oxide (ATO), and their impact on the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. Among the analyzed catalysts, Pt black mixed with synthesized IrO2 supported on developed ATO exhibited the highest performance, considering the results from both the fuel cell and electrolyzer systems.

Hydrogen obtained from electrochemical water splitting is the most promising clean energy carrier, which is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, the development of an efficient OER electrocatalyst using nonprecious 3d transition elements is desirable. Multielement synergistic effect and lattice oxygen oxidation are two well-known mechanisms to enhance the OER activity of catalysts. The latter is generally related to the high valence state of 3d transition elements leading to structural destabilization under the OER condition. We have found that Al doping in nanosheet Ni-Fe hydroxide exhibits 2-fold advantage: (1) a strong enhanced OER activity from 277 mV to 238 mV at 10 mA cm

Rechargeable zinc-air batteries have been identified as promising technologies for energy storage. However, developing cost-effective electrocatalysts that can efficiently facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for their advancement. This work investigates synthesized electrocatalysts composed of graphene-Cu2O deposited on carbon cloth by doctor blading casting method as bifunctional electrodes in a rechargeable Zn-air battery. The battery integrated with graphene-Cu2O as the air-cathode electrocatalyst showed superior performance in terms of cycling stability compared to that without Cu2O. This enhanced performance is attributed to the reversibility of Cu+/Cu2+ species during the redox reactions facilitated by the high electrical conductivity of graphene. Therefore, the results suggest the potential of the synthesized electrodes for advancing the development of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.

Abstract Electrocatalysis, which involves oxidation and reduction reactions with direct electron transfer, is essential for a variety of clean energy conversion devices. Currently, the vast majority of studies regarding electrocatalysis reactions focus on strong acidic or alkaline media because of the higher catalytic activity. Nevertheless, some inherent drawbacks, including the corrosive environment, expensive proton exchange membranes, and side effects, are still hard to break through. A sustainably promising way to overcome these shortcomings is to deploy neutral/near‐neutral electrolytes for electrocatalysis reactions. Unfortunately, insufficient research in this area due to the lack of attention to related issues has slowed down the development process. In this review, we systematically review the catalytic reaction mechanisms, neutral electrolytes, electrocatalysts, and modification strategies carried out in neutral media on the three most common electrocatalytic reactions, that is, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the advanced characterization tools for guiding catalyst synthesis and mechanistic studies are also summarized. Eventually, we propose some challenges and perspectives on electrocatalysis reactions in neutral media and hope it will attract more research interest and provide guidance in neutral electrocatalysis.

Using nickel foam as a substrate for electrocatalyst to report overpotential in a manuscript is a popular method in electrochemical testing or water-splitting i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, use of coated Nickel foam as substrate methodology is, in essence, not reasonable for studying the intrinsic chemistry difference of electrocatalysts. To assess water-splitting devices, Ni-foam is a valid substrate if nanoparticles are grown uniformly; however, when drop-casted ink methodology is used or there is inhomogeneous growth of nanoparticles, it becomes difficult to determine whether a particular electrocatalyst is intrinsically active or not. In order to gain a rational understanding of the electrochemical activity and overpotential findings of a specific catalyst, it is essential to recognize the limitations of Ni-foam on reflecting its intrinsic role in electrocatalytic activity. Ni-foam is therefore should not be preferred as a conductive substrate during electrochemical testing (ET). On the contrary, use of other neutral substrates like carbon fiber paper (CFP) and glassy carbon electrode (GCE) should be employed.

Developing bifunctional non‐precious metal electrocatalysts of superior reactivity and durability is essential. Herein, we report a class of phthalocyanine‐based covalent organic frameworks as self‐sacrificial precursors derived Co‐based hybrid electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated Co‐COFs/CNT‐700 catalysts displayed highly efficient ORR properties with a half‐potential of 0.83 V, while its half‐wave potential in alkaline solution at a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 is 1.70 V in the OER test, reflecting exceptional OER activity. Moreover, zinc‐air batteries assembled with Co‐COFs/CNT‐700 catalysts exhibit a marginally higher power density (114 mW cm2) than traditional Pt/C‐IrO2 batteries in an air atmosphere, along with an enhanced cycling stability (5.1% potential loss after 65 h). This work may pave a facile and efficient approach for fabricating electrocatalytic materials with controllably introduced metals and heteroatoms.

The modification of Ir or oxygen vacancies (Vo) is a strategy to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of heterogeneous nanocatalysts. However, it is crucial to further clarify the synergistic effect of Ir and Vo on the enhancement mechanism of OER performance after surface reconstruction. In this work, FeCo Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) co-modified by Ir and Vo were successfully prepared by the thermodynamically favorable galvanic replacement reaction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that the synergistic effect of Ir and Vo enhanced the charge transfer of FeCo LDHs. XPS spectra reveal robust interactions between Ir and FeCo LDHs. Density-functional theory further reveals that the low-oxygen-coordinated Ir (III) acts as an active site to optimize the OER rate-determining step energy barrier. As a result, Ir and Vo co-modified FeCo LDH requires only a 203 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and, more importantly, operates stably at an industrial current density of 250 mA cm−2 for 312 h without degradation. This work provides new insights and avenues for understanding the enhanced performance mechanism of catalysts after surface reconstruction and for industrial scale-up production.

Direct seawater splitting is an environment‐friendly and promising technology to replace freshwater electrolysis for hydrogen production. The challenge of seawater electrolysis lies in the competition between chloride oxidation reaction (CER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as electrode corrosion and poisoning caused by chloride. Some small molecules have lower anodic electrocatalytic oxidation potentials compared to OER and CER, making them possible to substitute OER and/or CER in coupled electrolyzers not only to eliminate the electrode corrosion problem but also to significantly enhance the energy efficiency of seawater electrolysis. This article reviews the progress of such small molecule oxidation facilitated seawater electrolyzer. Starting with an overview of the key challenges in seawater electrolysis, this review introduces the fundamentals and advantages of the coupled seawater electrolyzers and discusses the strategies for anodic small molecule oxidation and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction, including utilizing Cl‐ as a reactive medium, value‐added chemical synthesis, pollutants electrooxidation, and optimizing electrolyzers. Finally, the challenges and prospects of small molecule oxidation facilitated seawater splitting are summarized, aiming to provide impetus for research and development on coupled seawater electrolysis technologies.

Mott-Schottky construction and plasmon excitation represent two highly-efficient and closely-linked coping strategies to the high energy loss of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the combined effect has rarely been investigated. Herein, with Ag nanoparticles as electronic structure regulator and plasmon exciter, Ag/CoV-LDH@G nanohybrids (NHs) with Mott-Schottky heterojunction and notable plasmon effect are well-designed. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, it was found that the Mott-Schottky construction modulates the Fermi level/energy band structure of CoV-LDH, which in turn leads to lowered d-band center (from -0.89 to -0.93), OER energy barrier (from 6.78 to 1.31 eV), and preeminent plasmon thermal/electronic effects. The thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, promote the deprotonation of *OOH, and accelerate electron transfer kinetics. Whereas the electronic effect can increase the density of charge carriers (from 0.70×10

Electric-driven water dissociation is considered to be a sustainable approach for the generation of H2. Ni nanoparticles show poor freshwater/seawater electrolysis activity owing to the severe aggregation of Ni, which blocks the active sites to catalyze water splitting. Here, we present Ni nanoparticles/N-doped carbon sheets by the thermal treatment of Ni-based triazole-benzoic acid complexes. The electronic state and coordination environment of Ni are modulated by the formation of the confined space with the N-doped carbon layer. Ni/N-doped carbon sheets promote acidic/alkaline hydrogen evolution activity with 143/81 mV@10 mA/cm2. Upon being used as the catalysts for water oxidation reaction, it expedited alkaline oxygen evolution 218/312 mV@10/50 mA/cm2 for Ni/N-doped carbon, which is even superior to commercial RuO2 with 309/364 mV. Tests for alkaline freshwater/seawater splitting find that Ni/N-doped carbon sheets possess remarkable activity with 1.56/1.62 V@10 mA/cm2 as well as outstanding stability. Our work offers an efficient strategy to rationally regulate the coordination structure of metal nanoparticles for promoting water electrolysis activity.

Abstract It is of essential importance to design bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater splitting. Herein, an approach for manipulating electron redistribution in NiCoP treated by P defect (P v ) engineering (NiCoP v @NF) is presented, exhibiting excellent catalytic activities and stability toward HER/OER in alkaline seawater solution. The P v reduces the surface electrooxidation reconfiguration energy barrier, making it easier to drive the local conversion of crystals to active oxy(hydroxide) in OER. In addition, the Ni site of NiCoP v and the Co site of NiCoOOH are the active sites for HER and OER processes, respectively. In situ generated PO 4 3− adsorbed on the catalyst surface causes spatial repulsion, preventing Cl − corrosion in seawater electrolysis. The seawater AEM electrolyzer using NiCoP v @NF couple achieves excellent performance of high activity (2.43 V at 500 mA cm −2 ) and long‐term durability (500 mA cm −2 over 110 h). The working efficiency of AEM in 1.0 M KOH is as high as 77.0% at 100 mA cm −2 with the price of per GGE H 2 as low as $ 0.87.

High-performance bifunctional catalysts must thus be synthesized to accelerate the reversible conversion of oxygen and improve the rate and overall performance of ZABs. Herein, we reported the promising prospects of self-supported composite electrodes composed of wood-derived carbon (WDC) and bimetallic cobalt-iron alloys/oxides (CoFe-CoFe 2 O 4 @WDC) as efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline ORR/OER. WDC provided a favorable three-phase interface for heterogeneous reactions owing to its layered porous structure and genetic stability, thereby enabling mass diffusion and improving reaction kinetics. The CoFe 2 O 4 spinel surface was reduced to bimetallic CoFe alloy to form abundant heterostructure interfaces that promote electron transfer. Under alkaline conditions, the optimized composite electrode exhibited a remarkable high half-wave potential of 0.85 V and an exceptionally low overpotential of 1.49 V. It also exhibited stable performance over an impressive 2340 cycles in a ZAB. Theoretical calculations also confirmed that the heterointerface addresses the issue of proton scarcity throughout the reaction and actively facilitates the creation of O–O bonds during the reversible transformation of oxygen. This study introduces a new concept for developing bifunctional and efficient electrocatalysts based on charcoal and encourages the sustainable and high-value use of forest biomass resources.

The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) plays a critical role in direct hydrazine fuel cells and presents a promising alternative to the kinetics-sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in water reduction. Engineering catalysts with high-density multifold nanotwin structures has emerged as a compelling strategy to enhance catalytic activity. However, the exploration of multifold nanotwins for HzOR applications remains absent. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a porous Ni-Zn-Cu catalyst featuring high-density twofold and fivefold nanotwins. The Ni-Zn-Cu catalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni-Zn-Cu/Ni foam) exhibits exceptionally high catalytic activity and stability toward the HzOR, achieving a current density of 204.3 mA·cm-2 at 0.0 V vs. RHE and retaining up to 89.1% after 20 hours of continuous electrolysis. Online mass spectrometer (MS) analysis indicates that the Ni-Zn-Cu coating facilitates N-N bond cleavage of N2H4. This study offers valuable insights into the development of multifold nanotwin catalysts for advancing HzOR applications.

While dual-atom catalysts benefiting from synergetic interatomic interactions have inspired the development of emerging catalysts, the role of atomic interactions on the catalytic selectivity and activity has yet to be clearly discovered. Herein, two-types of Pt dual-atom active sites, Pt dimers (2Pt) with an interatomic distance of 2.6 Å and Pt pairs (Pt2) at a distance of 0.9 Å, are fabricated by anchoring onto cationic vacancy-rich nickel-based hydroxide (Pt@NiFeCo-E). It reveals that 2Pt sites are favorable for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while Pt2 sites are active towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The coexistence of two types of Pt dual atoms endows the bifunctional activity, which reached an overpotential of 14 mV@10 mA cm−2 for HER, an overpotential of 234 mV@100 mA cm−2 for OER, and an effective overall water splitting reaction (OWS) in alkaline at an overpotential of 1.42 V to reach 10 mA cm−2 and at 100 mA cm−2 for 50 h. This work not only clarifies a new mechanism in manipulating the selectivity of dual-atom catalysts via controlling the interatomic distance, but also paves a pathway for designing novel high-efficient bifunctional catalysts.

New advances in creating effective and affordable copper-based catalysts for water splitting represent a promising strategy for driving sustainable energy technologies. However, ma- terials containing copper are susceptible to corrosion and agglomeration. In this study, we describe a synthesis route to produce olamine-functionalized CuO nanoparticles using the Hot Injection method. Nanoparticles were obtained and subsequently deposited on FTO substrates, undergoing thermal treatment at 500&deg;C and 600&deg;C in atmospheres containing O2 and N2, aiming to enhance the adhesion of the active material to the substrate and modify its oxidation state. Microstructural properties were analyzed using XRD, SEM, and TEM, while electrochemical properties were studied using CV, LSV, and EIS. Electrodes treated thermally in an N2 atmosphere at 600&deg;C exhibited higher ESCA, indicating a greater area of active sites exposed to surface reactions and, therefore, superior catalytic activity in Hy- drogen Evolution Reaction (HER). These findings show an interesting strategy for avoiding rapid electron-hole recombination and, consequently, CuO corrosion. For Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), samples treated thermally in O2 atmosphere at 500&deg;C and 600&deg;C appear to be more effective.

Advancing efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for commercializing emerging energy devices. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose doping different transition metal (TM) atoms to regulate the electronic structures of the two-dimensional 1T-HfTe2 monolayer to achieve bifunctional catalysis for the ORR/OER. Due to the small electronegativity of the Hf atom, we found the doped TMs can generally form anion centers by accepting abundant charges from the Hf interlayer. At the same time, the highly conductive 1T-HfTe2 contributes to the charge transfer between the active center and the reaction intermediates, rendering the designed SACs the tunable activity for the reactions. By comparing the theoretical overpotentials of ORR and OER on 15 single-atom catalysts (SACs), Pt-doped system exhibits excellent catalytic activity for both ORR and OER, outperforming the traditional Pt(1 1 1) and RuO2(1 1 0) catalysts. Based on the charge transfer mechanism, we clarified that the doped TM atoms act as a 'bridge' to transfer the electrons from the substrate to the reaction intermediates, thereby effectively contributing to the improvement of catalytic activity. In summary, our study shows that, by doping appropriate TM atoms, the intrinsic inert HfTe2 can be activated toward efficient ORR/OER. This could provide some guidance for the design of new two-dimensional ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst materials.

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as an alternative to precious metals as efficient and low‐cost catalysts for water electrolysis. Elemental doping and morphology control are effective approaches to further improve the performance of TMPs. Herein, Fe‐doped CoP nanoframes (Fe‐CoP NFs) with specific open cage configuration were designed and synthesized. The unique nano‐framework structured Fe‐CoP material shows overpotentials of only 255 and 122 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, overwhelming most transition metal phosphides. For overall water splitting, the cell voltage is 1.65 V for Fe‐CoP NFs at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , much superior to what is observed for the classical nanocubic structures. Fe‐CoP NFs show no activity degradation up to 100 h which contrasts sharply with the rapidly decaying performance of noble metal catalyst reference. The superior electrocatalytic performance of Fe‐CoP NFs due to abundant accessible active sites, reduced kinetic energy barrier, and preferable *O‐containing intermediate adsorption is demonstrated through experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Our findings could provide a potential method for the preparation of multifunctional material with hollow structures and offer more hopeful prospects for obtaining efficient earth‐abundant catalysts for water splitting.

Abstract Liquid alkaline water electrolyzers (LAWEs), being the most commercially mature electrolysis technology, play a pivotal role in large-scale hydrogen production. However, LAWEs suffer from low operational efficiency, primarily due to un-optimized electrode structure and chemical compositions. Thus, we investigated how various electrode configurations could impact LAWE performance. Our results show that Ni felt electrodes outperform the conventional Ni foam thanks to improved electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and preferred electrode surface structure that minimizes the micro-gaps in between the electrode and separator. By comparing the stainless steel (SS) felt electrodes with Ni felt electrodes, SS not only shows better oxygen evolution reaction activity but also improved hydrogen evolution reaction activity, which is less studied in the literature. We also show that a bilayer structure with small pore radius facing the separator could further improve LAWE performance by further optimizing interfacial contact between electrode and separator. These findings enable LAWEs to sustain 2 A cm-2 at 2.2 V and operate steadily at 1 A cm-2 for nearly 600 h with negligible performance decay. Our studies establish criteria for selecting electrodes to achieve high-performance LAWE and, in turn, expedite the adoption of LAWEs in hydrogen production and the transition towards low-carbon economies.

To design and construct bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activity is important to the commercial development of electrochemical water splitting (EWS) technology. The carbon clothe (CC) supported on Ni(OH)2 nanosheet is used as template to tune the morphology of Ni0.85Se. To improve the activity of Ni0.85Se, amorphous Ni4Mo alloy is anchored on the Ni0.85Se to obtain the Ni0.85Se/Ni4Mo catalyst (NS/NM) by electrodeposition method. The electron state and conductivity of NS/NM are modulated compared to that of the NS sample. It is found that the electron transfers from Ni4Mo to Ni0.85Se. Benefiting from the tuned electron state of Ni0.85Se and Ni4Mo, the enhanced number of exposed active sites and lower Rct value, the NS/NM heterostructure electrode requires low overpotentials of 51 and 206 mV to obtain 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized electrode shows fast kinetics and exhibits near to 100% Faraday efficiency for HER and OER in 1 M KOH. Importantly, it is noted that the electrocatalytic activity of NS/NM catalyst for both HER and OER is enhanced obviously in comparison with NS sample. With heterostructure catalyst, the EWS only proceeds at 1.48 V to yield 10 mA cm−2, which is reduced about 110 mV compared to NS electrode. Here, a novel kind of bifunctional heterostructure electrocatalyst is constructed.

The development of high-performance electrocatalytic electrodes for overall water splitting is a crucial issue to realize renewable hydrogen production. This paper presents the in situ growth of N-modified Co-based nanorods on porous TiN ceramic membranes using the hydrothermal method and thermal NH3 treatment, resulting in a novel self-supported electrocatalytic electrode with abundant heterointerfaces, denoted as NCTN-x-y (x: nitridation temperature; y: nitridation time). In the alkaline medium (1 M KOH), the NCTN-350-2 electrode displays the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (ƞ10 = 66 mV), and the NCTN-250-3 electrode manifests the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (ƞ10 = 270 mV). Accordingly, these two electrodes comprise an electrolyzer, which features a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of 1.63 V. The good electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the abundant heterointerfaces formed between the porous TiN ceramic membrane and the N-modified Co-based nanorods, in conjunction with the hierarchical pore structure of the TiN ceramic membrane. Theoretical calculations identify that the construction of heterointerfaces modulates the electronic structure of active sites, thereby promoting the dissociation of H2O, optimizing the H* adsorption energy (ΔGH*), and accelerating the reaction kinetics, which ultimately improve the electrocatalytic activity of electrode.

Abstract Developing highly effective transition metal‐based bifunctional electrocatalysts remains a tremendously challenging task for large‐scale overall water splitting. Herein, a multiheterostructured Mo‐doped Ni 2 P/Fe x P electrocatalyst on NiFe foam with P vacancy (denoted as Mo─Ni 2 P/Fe x P‐V/NFF) is developed to serve as an efficient dual‐pH electrocatalyst. Due to the synergistic effect of multiple strategies (heteroatom doping, heterointerface, and P vacancy), the Mo─Ni 2 P/Fe x P‐V/NFF possesses remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity in alkaline/acidic and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, along with encouraging durability. The mechanisms of improved electrocatalytic activity combining multicharacterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are elucidated. Specifically, X‐ray absorption fine structure experimental analysis confirms that the Mo doping can optimize the electronic structure of electrocatalyst. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the evolved oxyhydroxides are the real active substances for the OER. DFT calculations reveal that the conductivity of as‐prepared samples can be enhanced through multiple strategy synergy. Moreover, in the HER process, multiple strategies can not only reduce the hydrogen binding energy to near zero but also enhance the H 2 O dissociation and *OH desorption. In the OER process, DFT calculations also verify that Mo doping and interface engineering can optimize the adsorption of the rate‐determining step, achieving the lowest theoretical overpotential.

Ultrathin film of active materials having thickness <5 nm emerged as a promising candidate for miniaturized energy storage and conversion devices. However, the small lateral size restricts its real device applications. Herein, we report large area, 2D, ultrathin (thickness: 4.3±0.3 nm) Co(OH)2 nanosheets as bi-functional electrode material for supercapacitor and oxygen evolution reaction developed by Ionic layer epitaxy (ILE) method at the water-air interface. The symmetric supercapacitor device exhibited excellent volumetric capacitance of 2313 F cm-3 at 0.4 mA cm-2 current density. Additionally, it exhibited a remarkable volumetric energy density of 0.205 Wh cm-3 at a power density of 0.145 W cm-3, which is better than reported 2D electrode materials. Furthermore, the Co(OH)2 ultrathin-film electrodes showed improved OER electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential (ƞ10, 330 mV) and Tafel slope (47 mV dec-1). The structural and morphological investigations after long-term operations show substantial stability of the electrode material. The theoretical investigations of electronic structures, quantum capacitance, and free energy profiles for the OER mechanism corroborate the experimental results.

Abstract Hybrid water electrolysis offers a groundbreaking approach to energy‐saving hydrogen production by utilizing thermodynamically favorable and value‐added reactions to replace sluggish anodic oxygen evolution in overall water splitting. However, numerous anodic processes generate intermediates or products incompatible with aqueous environments, thereby degrading anodic performance to limit the efficiency and durability of hybrid water electrolysis. Herein, this difficulty is addressed by applying anodic mass transport intensification in conjunction with catalyst engineering, realizing a long‐lasting hybrid seawater electrolysis coupling sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) for efficient hydrogen production below 1.2 V at an industrial‐level current density of 500 mA cm −2 . An exceptional longevity of 2000 h is achieved for the electrolysis by eliminating anode passivation by sulfur deposition during SOR, a general concern in the sulfur‐involved industrial sector. This technology cut the electricity expense of hydrogen production to 2.80 kWh m −3 H 2 , undercutting alkaline water electrolysis by 34.9–51.1%. Simultaneously, fast upcycling of sulfion pollutants to value‐added sulfur is achieved to add additional economic and environmental profits, enabling hydrogen production at a midpoint expense ($ 0.93) of the United States Department of Energy's 2026 target ($ 2.0) for the cost per gallon of gasoline‐equivalent.

Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high-temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir-B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor-acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate-determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir-B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B-induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

Abstract In this work, we explored the recovering possibilities of nickel‐based products from the cathode materials of spent nickel‐metal hydride (NiMH) batteries collected from car repair centers in Mongolia. Specifically, nickel‐based by‐products such as metallic nickel, Ni microparticles, nickel oxide, nickel chloride, and betta‐phase ( β ) nickel hydroxide powders are successfully produced. X‐ray diffraction patterns suggested that all samples show high crystallinity and phase purity. Ni microparticles were recovered using a chemical reduction method from a leachate solution prepared by dissolving the cathode of the spent NiMH battery in hydrochloric acid. Notably, β ‐Ni(OH)₂ displayed two redox peaks in KOH electrolyte solution, suggesting that it has excellent electrochemical potential and can be reused for the fabrication of new NiMH batteries. To validate the electrochemical performances, we examined the catalytic activity of nickel microparticles as a catalyst for the degradation of Congo red (CR) dye and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reduction reaction rate of CR dye in the presence of a nickel catalyst was 2.17×10 −3 s −1 , significantly higher than the control experiment without a nickel catalyst. These results provide possible solutions for developing sustainable battery systems by recovering different nickel‐based products from spent NiMH batteries.

Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high‐temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir‐B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor‐acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate‐determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir‐B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B‐induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exfoliated from bulk layered materials possess interesting properties. Most transition metal oxides (TMOs) are not layered and therefore cannot be exfoliated. Here we report the synthesis of a new family of ultrathin materials – transition metal oxychalcogenides (TMOCs) and demonstrate their unique properties. Specifically, 2D TMOCs such as HfSxOy, ZrSxOy, TiSxOy, TaSxOy, NbSxOy, VSexOy, HfSexOy, ZrSexOy, TaTexOy (x, y ~ 0–2) from bulk TMDs (HfS2, ZrS2, TiS2, TaS2, NbS2, VSe2, HfSe2, ZrSe2, TaTe2) have been fabricated using tetrabutylammonium intercalation. The stoichiometry of TMOCs can be adjusted, which enables control of their optical band gaps and tunability of electrical conductivity by more than 8 orders of magnitude. Our results show that by tuning the chalcogen to oxygen ratio along with local atomic structure in TMOCs, it is possible to impart unexpected properties. For example, in contrast to conventional TMDs, the hybrid structure renders TMOCs surprisingly stable and electrochemically active in strong acids, which allows them to be used as proof-of-concept catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at pH ≈ 0. The HfS0.52O1.09 catalysts show high mass activity (10,3000 A g–1 at an overpotential of 0.5 V) and exhibit durability in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysers.

The microbiological safety of irrigation water is critical to the prevention of fresh produce contamination with human pathogens. This work reports on the electrochemical disinfection of natural irrigation water using an undivided batch cell assembled with titanium (Ti) electrodes as both anode and cathode. Although Ti is considered an inactive electrode material for most applications due to the presence of an oxide film on the surface, we show here that it can efficiently catalyze the electrochemical oxidation of a few ppm of chloride ions in natural irrigation water to free chlorine species, which in turn enable fast disinfection. Disinfection experiments were performed by applying a polarity-reversing direct current between the two Ti electrodes. Compared to applying a polarity-constant direct current, the polarity-reversal technique effectively inhibited extensive oxidation of the Ti electrode surface as indicated by a lower oxide/hydroxide content on the electrode surface, thus providing excellent stability during electrolysis. The natural irrigation water was collected from the Waiahole Ditch Irrigation System in Hawaii. The naturally occurring concentration of chloride in the water was 1.84 mg/L and no other chemicals were added. E. coli K12 ER2738 was selected as a model bacterium to evaluate the electrochemical cell’s disinfection capability. The applied current density was varied between 0 mA/cm2 and 2 mA/cm2, and the half-period (T/2) of the polarity-reversing direct current was varied between 5 s and 60 s. The best disinfection performance was achieved at 2 mA/cm2 and T/2 = 10 s, requiring only 5 min of treatment for the complete disinfection of E. coli (4-log reduction). The trends in the concentration of free and total chlorine in the solution matched very well with those of the disinfection efficiency, suggesting that E. coli was inactivated by free chlorine species electrogenerated at the Ti electrodes. Hydrogen peroxide, short-lived oxidants, and direct electron transfer most likely had minor contributions to the disinfection process. The presence of a volcano-shaped dependence of the free and total chlorine concentration and disinfection efficiency on T/2 suggests that the chloride oxidation activity of the Ti electrode was closely related to the oxidation state (or the thickness of the oxide layer) of the electrode surface, i.e., there exists an optimal oxide layer thickness at which the Ti electrode shows the highest electrocatalytic activity toward chloride oxidation. During the disinfection experiment, disinfection byproducts (DBPs) of chlorate, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform were not detected in the solution. Chloroform was first seen in the solution at 10 min (2.5 μg/L), and then its concentration increased to 9.0 μg/L at 20 min. These values are significantly lower than recommendations for drinking water, and the timeframe of chloroform production suggests a 5 min disinfection treatment avoids significant DBP formation. As a comparison, Pt/Ti electrodes prepared by electrodeposition showed negligible disinfection at 2 mA/cm2, but the disinfection efficiency increased dramatically at 4 mA/cm2 and 6 mA/cm2. This phenomenon was most likely due to the Pt catalyst’s high activity, readily catalyzing side reactions such as oxygen evolution and oxidation of organic matter in the natural irrigation water. The Ti electrodes consumed less electrical energy than the Pt/Ti electrodes because they needed a lower current density to achieve similar disinfection efficiency. The current work demonstrates that the Ti electrode electrochemical cell can provide an efficient, robust, and cost-effective solution to irrigation water disinfection, and thus is well suited for agriculture sector applications.

Monitoring must be a basic element in oenological processes, assuring the oenologist's confidence in the supervision of the different processes. In this article, an analysis was carried out on all the works reported in the literature for the monitoring of different wine parameters in each phase. As described in the paper, artificial sensors have been developed to monitor the evolution of the fermentation and maceration phases. Similarly, in the ageing phase, other authors have developed different systems to monitor the evolution of the wine colour and oxygen. Within the particular case of biological ageing, not many developments have been found to control it. Given the scarcity of developments in this field, it would be necessary to propose a greater number of studies in this field.

Abstract. Understanding the compositions and evolution of atmospheric organic vapors is crucial for exploring their impact on air quality. However, the molecular and seasonal characteristics of organic vapors in urban areas, with complex anthropogenic emissions and high variability, remain inadequately understood. In this study, we conducted measurements in urban Beijing during 2021–2022 covering four seasons using a Vocus-PTR, an improved Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS). During the measurement period, a total of 895 peaks are observed, and 543 of them can be assigned to formulas. The contribution of CxHyOz species is most significant, which compose up to 53.7 % of the number and 76.0 % of the mass of total organics. With enhanced sensitivity and mass resolution, various sub-ppt level species and organics with multiple oxygens (≥3) were discovered. When counting the species number, 42.2 % of the organics measured are at sub-ppt level and 37.8 % of the species contain 3–8 oxygens. Organic vapors with multiple oxygens mainly consist of intermediate volatility and semi-volatile compounds, and many of them are found to be the multi-generational oxidation products of various volatile organic precursors. In summer, the fast photooxidation process generates organic vapors with multiple oxygens, and leads to an increase in both their concentration and proportion. While in other seasons, the variations of organic vapors with multiple oxygens are closely correlated with those of organic vapors with 1–2 oxygens, which could be heavily influenced by primary emissions. Organic vapors with low oxygen content (≤ 2 oxygens) are comparable to the results obtained by traditional PTR-MS measurements in both urban Beijing and neighboring regions.

Paleontological and phylogenomic observations have shed light on the evolution of cyanobacteria. Nevertheless, the emergence of heterocytes, specialized cells for nitrogen fixation, remains unclear. Heterocytes are surrounded by heterocyte glycolipids (HGs), which contribute to protection of the nitrogenase enzyme from oxygen. Here, by comprehensive HG identification and screening of HG biosynthesis genes throughout cyanobacteria, we identify HG analogs produced by specific and distantly related non-heterocytous cyanobacteria. These structurally less complex molecules probably acted as precursors of HGs, suggesting that HGs arose after a genomic reorganization and expansion of ancestral biosynthetic machinery, enabling the rise of cyanobacterial heterocytes in an increasingly oxygenated atmosphere. Subsequently, HG chemical structure evolved convergently in response to environmental pressures. Our results open a new chapter in the potential use of diagenetic products of HGs and HG analogs as fossils for reconstructing the evolution of multicellularity and division of labor in cyanobacteria.

C4 photosynthesis is a repeatedly evolved adaptation to photosynthesis that functions to reduce energy loss from photorespiration. The recurrent evolution of this adaptation is achieved through changes in the expression and localisation of several enzymes and transporters that are conventionally used in non-photosynthetic metabolism. These alterations result in the establishment of a biochemical CO2 pump that increases the concentration of CO2 around rubisco in a cellular environment where rubisco is protected from oxygen thus preventing the occurrence of photorespiration. A key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is the change in subcellular localisation of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity from the mesophyll cell chloroplast to the cytosol, where it catalyzes the first biochemical step of the C4 pathway. Here, we achieve this key step in C4 evolution in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) using genome editing. We show that editing the chloroplast transit peptide of the primary CA isoform in the leaf results in relocalisation of leaf CA activity from the chloroplast to the cytosol. Through analysis of fluorescence induction kinetics in these CA relocalisation lines we uncover a role a new role for chloroplast CA in photosynthetic induction. We also reveal that relocalisation of CA activity to the cytosol causes no detectable perturbation to plant growth or leaf-level CO2 assimilation. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel role for chloroplast CA in C3 plants, and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis by genome editing.

Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a major public health concern. Antibiotic intermediates (AIs) used in the production of semisynthetic antibiotics have the same bioactive structure as parent antibiotics and synthetic antibiotic production wastewater usually contains high concentrations of residual AIs; however, the effects of AIs and their interactive effects with antibiotics on the emergence of AR are unknown. In this study, antibiotic-sensitive E. coli K12 was exposed to five types of β-lactam AIs and their parent antibiotic ampicillin to analyze their impact on the evolution of multiple AR. The results indicated that AI 6-APA inhibits bacterial growth and stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species, as well as induces AR and antibiotic persistence like the parent antibiotic AMP. Combined exposure to 6-APA and AMP synergistically stimulated the induction of multiple AR and antibiotic persistence. The resistance mutation frequency increased up to 6.1×106-fold under combined exposure and the combination index reached 1326.5, indicating a strong synergy of 6-APA and AMP. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that these effects were associated with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, enhanced stress response signatures, and activation of efflux pumps. These findings provide evidence and mechanistic insights into AR induction by AIs in antibiotic production wastewater.

The Early Tonian period in the São Francisco Craton represents the development of an intracontinental rift across the northern and central Espinhaço regions, playing a crucial role in understanding the tectonic evolution of the Neoproterozoic Period within this craton and its adjacent orogens. This rift is associated with the breakup of the São Francisco paleoplate, marked by the formation of several rifts, some of which were aborted (e.g. Santo Onofre Rift), and magmatism associated. Field investigations, coupled with petrographic, lithogeochemical, and U-Pb geochronological data of the Serra do Meio Suite, elucidate key characteristics and offer significant insights into the Tonian tectonic evolution of the São Francisco Craton and its relationship with Santo Onofre Rift. The suite comprises metagranitoids exhibiting a mineralogical composition spanning from alkali-feldspar granites to granites and its petrogenesis and tectonic characteristics reveal an alkaline to calc-alkalic signature, exhibiting extreme ferroan geochemistry and indications of moderate to high oxygen fugacity. Pressure estimations suggest low-pressure conditions during magma crystallization, implying shallow crustal emplacement. The suite's evolution involves complex petrogenetic processes, likely influenced by fractional crystallization and contamination by country rocks from a quartz-feldspathic crustal source, as well as a possible contribution from juvenile tholeiitic mantle sources associated with rift environments, showcasing a signature typical of A1-type granite. The U-Pb SHRIMP age, determined as 930 ± 2 Ma (MSWD = 0.34), is interpreted as the crystallization age of the rock and allows us to connect it to the opening of the Santo Onofre-Macaúbas Rift in the São Francisco Craton.

Abstract The utilization of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) have underscored their utility in addressing the challenge of the elevated overpotential during the charging process. Nonetheless, the generation of highly electrophilic singlet oxygen (1O2) throughout the battery cycles leads to adverse reactions with RMs, thereby impeding their effectiveness. In the quest for enhanced RM durability, this study unveils a novel RM, 7,7'-bi-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (BAC), incorporating N–N interconnected aza-bicycles, and assesses its efficacy and robustness relative to those of other N–N non-bicyclic RMs. Unlike non-bicyclic RMs, which exhibit diminished O2 evolution after exposure to 1O2, BAC maintains consistent O2 profiles during charging, indicating its superior 1O2 resistance and steady redox-catalyst performance in LOBs. Theoretical analyses align with the experimental findings that the bicyclic structural design of BAC confers a superior ability to resist oxidative degradation through cleavage of the C–H bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms.

Starting from completely deoxygenated samples ($\delta$ = 0), both the mass evolution in an oxygen atmosphere and a differential temperature value referenced to an inert sample (alumina powder) subjected to the same experimental conditions are recorded. The oxygenation process itself is identified as an exothermic process accompanied by a second also exothermic associated process. This second process is identified as the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition present in the material. Based on the obtained results, the structural phase diagram of the material is reconstructed. Issues of metastability of the structural phases, as well as the potential of the equipment used to obtain these results comparable to those obtained in large facilities, are discussed. Reinterpretations of previously discussed works in the literature are inferred.

Abstract. A three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model with multiple nutrient and plankton functional groups was developed and adapted to the Gulf of Mexico to investigate the role of nutrients and the complexity of plankton community in dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics. A 15-year hindcast was achieved covering the period of 2006–2020. Extensive model validation against in situ data demonstrates that the model was capable of reproducing vertical distributions of DO and spatial distributions of bottom DO concentration, as well as their interannual variations. The study demonstrates that bottom DO dynamics and hypoxia evolution are significantly influenced by both physical processes and local biochemistry, with sedimentary oxygen consumption and vertical diffusion identified as key contributors. Summer hydrodynamics play a critical role in nutrient distribution and limitation: a notable expansion of Si limitation was simulated when coastal currents shifted eastward or northward. This effect, especially pronounced on the western part of the Louisiana–Texas shelf, underscores the importance of nutrient limitation in shaping DO dynamics. The model identifies a bi-peak primary production pattern in spring and early summer, aligned with satellite chlorophyll a variations, attributed to the complexity of the plankton community and interactions among different plankton groups. Our findings emphasize the necessity of integrating sophisticated plankton community dynamics into biogeochemical models to understand primary production variability and its impact on bottom hypoxia.

Numerical simulations are carried out to understand the heat energy transport characteristics of an autothermal reactor by steam-methanol reforming on copper-based catalysts. Mathematical expressions are derived for the reactor system based upon the principles of chemical kinetics and fluid mechanics. Enthalpy analysis is performed and the evolution of energy in the reforming and oxidation processes is discussed in terms of reaction heat flux. The effects of different factors on the thermal behavior of the autothermal reactor is evaluated in order to fully describe the thermal energy change in the reactor. The objective of the present study is to understand the heat energy transport characteristics of microchannel reactors for hydrogen production by steam-methanol reforming on copper-based catalysts. Emphasis is placed on the effects of different factors on the thermal behavior of autothermal reactors. The results indicate that the heat required for the endothermic reforming reaction must pass through the wall of the tube. Minimal oxygen requirements serve to inhibit carbon formation in the catalyst bed. Small size and weight allow for rapid catalyst bed heat-up to operating temperatures which is a critical requirement for quick start capability necessary in most vehicle applications. The temperature within the hot spot can be increased or decreased respectively by increasing or decreasing respectively the amount of oxygen supplied to the mixture. Direct heating is of considerable advantage as it largely overcomes the problems encountered with reaction rates being limited by the rate of heat transfer through the tube wall. The intervening walls may be flat plates or cylindrical walls with heat transfer capabilities. The separation is often affected by an adsorption process after condensing out the steam from the shifted gas. Silicon is considered a good material for fabrication of microreactors due to the high strength of the silicon-silicon bonds which results in the chemical inertness and thermal stability of silicon.

Abstract Complex liquid–solid reactions occur during brazing. A deep understanding of brazing liquid evolution is therefore of important concern for the bonding between filler and substrates. The joining of gas‐pressure‐sintered silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) ceramic to oxygen‐free copper (OFC) foil was prepared using Ag–Cu–TiH 2 filler at 875°C for 0.5 h. The effect of the Ag:Cu ratio on the interfacial microstructure and peeling strength of the joints was analyzed. The reaction of brazing liquid with Si 3 N 4 ceramic includes reactions with both the β‐Si 3 N 4 and the grain boundary phases (Y–Si–Mg–O–N). The resulting interfacial reaction products include TiN, Ti 5 Si 3 , and potential Cu 3 Ti 3 O. Based on the phase composition and three‐dimensional morphology of the interfacial reaction products in the Si 3 N 4 ceramic/OFC foil joints, a model for the evolution of the brazing liquid as the reaction proceeds was proposed. Peeling test results indicated that the peeling strength of the joints rises unilaterally with the increase of the Ag:Cu ratio in the filler until reaching the peak value of 24.3 N/mm at the maximum Ag:Cu ratio of 90:10. The mechanisms of the joint peeling fracture were discussed in detail.

Abstract The interturn paper insulation of oil‐immersed power transformer windings, under the combined influence of electric fields, moisture, and conductor heating, will produce bubbles, which pose a significant threat to the insulation system. However, there is limited research on the characteristics of bubble evolution in oil–paper insulation under the influence of electric fields and the subsequent dissolution process. Based on the continuous observation of bubble size using electron microscopes, experimental and theoretical investigations into the formation and dissolution of bubbles under electric field conditions are presented. The effects of different field strengths on bubble evolution and dissolution characteristics were studied. The results showed that the electric field promoted both the generation and dissolution of bubbles, with a more pronounced effect observed at higher field strengths (below partial discharge (PD) inception electric field, hereafter referred to as PDIE). However, when the field strength exceeded PDIE, the bubbles tended to shrink and gradually increase in size. The changes in bubble volume were related to not only gas diffusion but also oxygen consumption and fault gases generation due to PD. A better understanding of the formation and dissolution characteristics of bubbles under varying field strengths is achieved. Furthermore, it also provides a reference for assessing the risk of bubble generation and conducting bubble‐related fault diagnosis during the overload operation of oil‐immersed power equipment.

Abstract Photocatalytic water splitting for clean hydrogen production has been a very attractive research field for decades. However, the insightful understanding of the actual active sites and their impact on catalytic performance is still ambiguous. Herein, a Pr‐doped TiO 2 ‐supported Cu single atom (SA) photocatalyst is successfully synthesized (noted as Cu/Pr‐TiO 2 ). It is found that Pr dopants passivate the formation of oxygen vacancies, promoting the density of photogenerated electrons on the CuSAs, and optimizing the electronic structure and H * adsorption behavior on the CuSA active sites. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of the obtained Cu/Pr‐TiO 2 catalyst reaches 32.88 mmol g −1 h −1 , 2.3 times higher than the Cu/TiO 2 . Innovatively, the excellent catalytic activity and performance is attributed to the active sites change from O atoms to CuSAs after Pr doping is found. This work provides new insight for understanding the accurate roles of single atoms in photocatalytic water splitting.

Abstract This study presents an overview of the Late Cenozoic evolution of the West African Monsoon (WAM), and the associated changes in atmospheric dynamics and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation (δ 18 O p ). This evolution is established by using the high‐resolution isotope‐enabled GCM ECHAM5‐wiso to simulate the climatic responses to paleoenvironmental changes during the Mid‐Holocene (MH), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and Mid‐Pliocene (MP). The simulated responses are compared to a set of GCM outputs from Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 4 (PMIP4) to assess the added value of a high resolution and model consistency across different time periods. Results show WAM magnitudes and pattern changes that are consistent with PMIP4 models and proxy reconstructions. ECHAM5‐wiso estimates the highest WAM intensification in the MH, with a precipitation increase of up to 150 mm/month reaching 25°N during the monsoon season. The WAM intensification in the MP estimated by ECHAM5‐wiso (up to 80 mm/month) aligns with the mid‐range of the PMIP4 estimates, while the LGM dryness magnitude matches most of the models. Despite an enhanced hydrological cycle in MP, MH simulations indicate a ∼50% precipitation increase and a greater northward extent of WAM than the MP simulations. Strengthened conditions of the WAM in the MH and MP result from a pronounced meridional temperature gradient driving low‐level westerly, Sahel‐Sahara vegetation expansion, and a northward shift of the Africa Easterly Jet. The simulated δ 18 O p values patterns and their relationship with temperature and precipitation are non‐stationarity over time, emphasizing the implications of assuming stationarity in proxy reconstruction transfer functions.

Extreme pinniped divers are extraordinary models to study adaptations to hypoxia/reoxygenation events derived from extreme fluctuations in oxygen levels during deep diving. We analyzed the evolutionary adaptations of the Weddell seal ( Leptonychotes weddellii) and the Northern and Southern elephant seals ( Mirounga angustirostris and M. leonina), which have exceptional diving abilities, reaching depths of over 1000 meters for extended periods up to 90 minutes. To understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning these remarkable adaptations, we conducted a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of thirteen pinniped species. Our gene family evolution analyses revealed a significant loss of function in genes involved in the enzymatic degradation of glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant that our functional analysis have previously shown to increase rapidly in response to hypoxia exposure in primary cells derived from extreme divers, likely to protect cells against oxidative damage. We also detected adaptive signatures in pathways involved in the optimization of mitochondrial respiration, energy metabolism, DNA repair and cardiovascular regulation in these extreme divers. Notably the Weddell seal exhibited more genes under positive selection compared to the Elephant seals, possibly reflecting adaptations to extreme environmental pressures. Pathways enriched in Weddell seals include those related to fat metabolism, oxidative damage against hydrogen peroxide and membrane lipid remodeling. Our analysis sheds light on the remarkable genomic adaptations that enable extreme pinniped divers to tolerate oxygen fluctuations associated with deep diving while offering valuable insights into their unique physiological and biochemical strategies for overcoming the challenges posed by hypoxia and reperfusion damage.

Introduction. Pneumonia is a common infectious disease among children, very familiar to pediatricians and a major cause of hospitalization worldwide. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) - atypical pathogen, is estimated to be responsible for approximately 30-40% of community-acquired pneumonias. The aim of the paper was to underline the diagnostic and treatment difficulties in a case of pneumonia with M. pneumoniae in a school-aged boy, with multiple presentations in the Emergency Service for respiratory difficulties. Material and method. We present the case of a 7 years and 10-month-old male patient, admitted to our clinic for wheezing, cough and dyspnea. Results. The clinical exam at admission pointed out influenced general status, wheezing, thoraco-abdominal swing, intercostal draft, sibilant and crackles, oxygen saturation 89%, tachycardia 134 beats/minute. The blood tests revealed mild leukocytosis, with neutrophilia, slightly increased inflammatory biomarkers. Considering the general status and the presence of functional respiratory syndrome, steroid and symptomatic anti-inflammatory treatment is initiated. However, the general condition remains stable, which required the widening of the spectrum of investigations with the performance of a chest CT noticing a pneumonic condensation with an air bronchogram located at the level of the right upper lobe. Considering the stationary respiratory functional syndrome and the radiological appearance of the pneumonia as well as the age, we performed serology for atypical germs and identified a positive titer of Ig M antibodies for M. pneumoniae by instituting Azithromycin po., but after 3 days, the evolution remains stationary, thus we changed the treatment with intravenous Levofloxacin, with a favorable subsequent evolution. Conclusions. Pneumonia with atypical pathogens such as M. pneumoniae is a well-defined and well-known pathology in the literature, but it still remains a condition that imposes multiple difficulties related to the diagnosis and therapeutic management of pediatric cases.

Abstract We report direct measurements of the magnetic field screening at the limits of the Meissner phase for two superconducting Nb samples. The samples are processed with two different surface treatments that have been developed for superconducting radio-frequency cavity applications — a “baseline” treatment and an oxygen-doping (“O-doping” ) treatment. The measurements show: 1) that the screening length is significantly longer in the “O-doping” sample compared to the “baseline” sample; 2) that the screening length near the limits of the Meissner phase increases with applied field; 3) the evolution of the screening profile as the material transitions from the Meissner phase to the mixed phase; and 4) a demonstration of the absence of any screening profile for the highest applied field, indicative of the full flux entering the sample. Measurements are performed utilizing the β -detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β -NMR) technique that allows depth resolved studies of the local magnetic field within the first 100 nm of the surface. The study takes advantage of the β -SRF beamline, a new facility at TRIUMF, Canada, where field levels up to 200 mT are available parallel to the sample surface to replicate radio frequency (RF) fields near the Meissner breakdown limits of Nb.

The progressive transfer of photogenerated electrons between the catalyst components and reactants is of great significance for photocatalysis. Amorphous Pd (PdA) and oxygen vacancies (VOs) were simultaneously introduced in Pd-In2O3 exploiting hydrogen-induced amorphization effects; 0.6 wt% Pd-In2O3 exhibited a 4.5-fold increase in activity and a 3.2-fold higher selectivity toward CH3OH + CO (63.62 %) compared with In2O3. Multiple in situ techniques and theoretical calculations revealed that intercomponent electron transfer channels were established via various interface structures formed between PdA or crystalline Pd (PdC) and In2O3; PdA acted as electronic pump, facilitating the transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons, resulting in their subsequent enrichment on the surface of PdA. Simultaneously, PdA acted as electron-donating adsorption site for H2O, increasing the number of electrons received by H2O, further inhibiting the competitive adsorption of H2O and CO2 on VO sites, and promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, the electronic coupling between PdC and VOs could significantly decrease the electron-donating ability of VOs, reducing the number of electrons received by CO2, thus effectively regulating the degree of CO2 reduction. This study employs PdA/PdC and VOs to synergistic optimize the progressive transfer of photogenerated electrons, and presents a novel approach for elucidating the catalytic mechanism.

Sustainable and rapid production of high-valent cobalt-oxo (Co(IV)=O) species for efficiently removing organic pollutants is challenging in permoxymonosulfate (PMS) based advanced-oxidation-processes (AOPs) due to the limitation of the high 3d-orbital electronic occupancy of Co and slow conversion from Co(III) to Co(II). Herein, S-scheme BiOCl-OV/CoAl-LDH heterojunction were constructed by ultrathin BiOCl with the oxygen-vacancy (OV) self-assembled with ultrathin CoAl-LDH. OV promoted the formation of charge transfer channel (Bi-O-Co bonds) at the interface of the heterojunction and reduced electron occupation of the Co 3d-orbital to facilitate the generation of Co(IV)=O in the BiOCl-OV/CoAl-LDH/PMS/Visible-light system. S-scheme heterojunction accelerated the photogenerated electrons to allow rapid conversion of Co(III) to Co(II), promoting the fast two-electron transfer from Co(II) to Co(IV)=O. Consequently, the developed BiOCl-OV/CoAl-LDH/PMS/Visible-light system showed excellent degradation efficiency for most of organic pollutions, and exhibited very high removal capability for the actual industrial wastewater. This study provides a new insight into the evolution of Co(IV)=O and the coordinative mechanism for photocatalysis and PMS activation.

Advancing protonic ceramic electrochemical cell (PCEC) technology offers promise for a variety of energy applications, including membrane reactors, fuel cells, and electrolyzers. Computational modeling of PCECs requires tracking the movement of three mobile charge carriers: protons, oxygen vacancies, and small polarons to adequately predict the cell operating characteristics. This paper develops an experimentally validated, quasi-2D (1+ 1D), transient, dual-channel cell model based on a multiple-charged defect-conducting electrolyte. The new model advances predictive capabilities on a number of fronts. First, it reduces empiricism, simplifies integration of experimentally derived modeling parameters, and enables rapid model scale-up to large cell platforms. Additionally, it predicts the distribution of properties in the streamwise gas flow direction and cell faradaic efficiency over a wide range of operating cell conditions helping to establish the inlet gas conditions needed to produce a dry hydrogen product gas. Model simulation reveals that the evolution of steady-state, thermal-neutral voltages in a PCEC can significantly change from initial operating values due to a dynamic, complex interaction which arises from local decreases in faradaic efficiency. Insights from model-based performance predictions touch upon thermal management considerations and the means for regulating cell temperature when trying to achieve either adiabatic or quasi-isothermal PCEC operation.

Hydrogen is being employed for more than only the typical industrial processes that involve creating ammonia, methanol, and refined petroleum. In recent years, there has been an increase in interest in the large-scale adoption of renewable energy-based power plants, as well as industrial and transportation uses, with a focus on manufacturing green hydrogen via the electrolysis process.

Lanthanide oxides have potential advantages for photocatalytic hydrogen production. To systematically investigate the photocatalytic performance of lanthanide oxides on metal sulfides, a series of LnxOy/ZnIn2S4 (LnxOy/ZIS) were synthesized by hydrothermal method. Comprehensive characterization demonstrated that LnxOy synergistically improved the performance of ZnIn2S4 by extending light absorption, reducing contact interface resistance and enhancing carrier separation. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) rates of the LnxOy/ZIS photocatalysts were improved, which were 1.6 to 4.2 times higher than those of pure ZnIn2S4 (198.0 μmol g-1 h-1). The PHE rates of LnxOy/ZIS decreased with increasing lanthanide atomic number, and when the lanthanides contained variable valence ions, the PHE rates of LnxOy/ZIS were superior to those of neighbouring lanthanides. The heterojunction formed by LnxOy and ZnIn2S4 effectively promoted carrier separation. Lanthanide ions with unoccupied 4 f orbital were more likely to accept electrons and served as a hydrogen adsorption site for further hydrogen reduction. Multivalent ions could also promote the migration of electrons and generate oxygen vacancies to inhibit the recombination of carriers. In conclusion, for ZnIn2S4, lanthanide oxides are promising candidates to improve the performance of PHE. This study provides guidance on the selection of appropriate lanthanide oxides for the construction of efficient sulphur-based heterojunction photocatalysts.

Abstract In layered Li‐rich materials, over stoichiometric Li forms an ordered occupation of LiTM6 in TM layer, showing a honeycomb superstructure along [001] direction. At the atomic scale, the instability of the superstructure at high voltage is the root cause of problems such as capacity/voltage decay of Li‐rich materials. Here we report a Li‐rich material with a high Li/Ni disorder, these interlayer Ni atoms locate above the honeycomb superstructure and share adjacent O coordination with honeycomb TM. These Ni‐O bonds act as cable‐stayed bridge to the honeycomb plane, and improve the high‐voltage stability. The cable‐stayed honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by in‐situ X‐ray diffraction to have a unique cell evolution mechanism that it can alleviate interlaminar lattice strain by promoting in‐plane expansion along a‐axis and inhibiting c‐axis stretching. Electrochemical tests also demonstrate significantly improved long cycle performance after 500 cycles (86% for Li‐rich/Li half cell and 82% for Li‐rich/Si‐C full cell) and reduced irreversible oxygen release. This work proves the feasibility of achieving outstanding stability of lithium‐rich materials through superstructure regulation and provides new insights for the development of the next‐generation high‐energy‐density cathodes.

Vanadium (V) is ubiquitously distributed in environmental media, imposing toxic hazards to organisms in biogeosphere. This review focuses on a comprehensive summary of the ecological and human health risks ascribed to V pollution, based on existing V toxicity relevant publications. Lower doses of V (< 2 mg/L) is beneficial to plant growth, however, V reduces plant biomass, induces toxic effects on plant morphology and adversely affects the absorption of essential plant elements at higher levels (≥ 2 mg/L). Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced under V stress may be the main reason for V toxicity to terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Although V contributes to high-efficient biological nitrogen fixation as a co-factor, V alters microbial community structures and drives its evolution. V can also accumulate in and harm human bodies. Knowledge gaps and further perspectives in aspects of V risks are thereby proposed, such as more toxic data reports for deriving V environmental quality criteria, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of detoxification and tolerance of organisms to V for bioremediation applications, and exploring the medical potential of V with the prevention of V toxicity to humans. This review advances our understanding of the toxic effects of V in the ecosystem and inspires future efforts on V management as well as application.

Cyanobacteria oxygenated the atmosphere of early Earth and continue to be key players in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. A phylogenetically diverse subset of extant cyanobacteria can perform photosynthesis with far-red light through a process called far-red light photoacclimation, or FaRLiP. This phenotype is enabled by a cluster of ~20 genes, and involves the synthesis of red-shifted chlorophylls f and d, together with paralogues of the ubiquitous photosynthetic machinery used in visible light. The FaRLiP gene cluster is present in diverse, environmentally important cyanobacterial groups but its origin, evolutionary history, and connection to early biotic environments have remained unclear. This study takes advantage of the recent increase in (meta)genomic data to clarify this issue; sequence data mining, metagenomic assembly, and phylogenetic tree networks were used to recover more than 600 new FaRLiP gene sequences, corresponding to 52 new gene clusters. These data enable high-resolution phylogenetics and - by relying on multiple gene trees, together with gene arrangement conservation - support FaRLiP appearing early in cyanobacterial evolution. Sampling information shows that considerable FaRLiP diversity can be observed in microbialites to the present day, and the process may have been associated with microbial mats and stromatolite formation in the early Paleoproterozoic. The ancestral FaRLiP cluster was reconstructed, revealing a conserved intergenic regulatory sequence that has been maintained for billions of years. Taken together, our results indicate that oxygenic photosynthesis using far-red light may have played a significant role in Earth's early history.    

    

## Evolution of the peroxiredoxin gene family: an antioxidant enzyme in the context of hypoxia-induced by aquatic mammals dives

Peroxiredoxins are a group of antioxidant enzymes that play a crucial role in eliminating hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produced during cellular metabolism. In conditions such as tissue ischemia/reperfusion, H 2 O 2 production is heightened. This scenario is recurrent in aquatic mammals, such as cetaceans and pinnipeds, when they perform breath-hold dives that lead to depletion of oxygen stores and cell hypoxia due to prolonged submersion. In such circumstances, peroxiredoxins are essential for regulating metabolism and preventing oxidative damage. Thus, our objective was to investigate evolutionary patterns of the peroxiredoxin gene family among aquatic mammalian species. Accordingly, we identified the number of ortholog and paralog genes among mammals, examining events of gene duplication, patterns of chromosomal distribution, and adaptive selection. We found that most subtypes of peroxiredoxins are characterized by single-copy genes with minimal missing data, with PRDX1, the most highly expressed subtype found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, exhibiting an increase in gene copies in aquatic mammals, particularly in pinnipeds. The distribution of the copies was dispersed along the genome and the majority were retrocopies of the main coding sequence with little divergence among them. We also found evidence of positive selection in the PRDX3 gene, especially in a convergent mutation among two deepest-diving species, cuvier’s beaked whale and southern elephant seal in which the amino acid had radical physical-chemical property change, possibly affecting the protein function. These results suggest that the peroxiredoxin gene family has a role in the evolution of aquatic mammals by reducing oxidative damage intrinsic to diving behavior in these species.

The analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of [${\alpha}$/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-${\alpha}$ and low-${\alpha}$ sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality, invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration. Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H], thus confirming previous suggestions by Gratton et al. (1996) and Fuhrmann (1998). Then we try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models. We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking also into account possible accretion of dwarf satellites. The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] exhibit a sharp increase of [Fe/$\alpha$] at a nearly constant [$\alpha$/H] (where $\alpha$ elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. A chemical model predicting a stop in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and where the high-$\alpha$ disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy can well explain the observations.

During the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), interstitial proton intercalation readily occurs in some transition metal oxide (TMO) catalysts and changes their d-band electronic structure. This work fabricated phosphorus (P)-doped tungsten oxide (WO3) with enriched oxygen vacancies (OVs) to study the impact of proton intercalation and heteroatom doping on eNRR and HER. Our results demonstrated that the electronic structure of the P-OV-WO3 catalyst was altered by in situ proton intercalation as indicated by the greater negative onset potential of eNRR at −0.05 V compared to the proton intercalation potential of 0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Compared to the non-P-doped WO3, the introduction of P doping in WO3 (e.g., 4.8 at. %) led to a reduction of more than 36% in proton intercalation. As a result, the HER activity of the P-OV-WO3 was significantly suppressed, as demonstrated by a considerably negative shift of the onset HER potential from −0.06 to −0.15 V and a slower HER kinetics with the Tafel slope increased from 129.0 to 343.1 mV/dec. Density functional theory calculations revealed the synergy of the proton intercalation, substitutional P doping, and the associated OVs in the improvement of N2 activation and hydrogenation in eNRR. The increased eNRR and the suppressed HER led to a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 64.1% and the NH3 yield of 24.5 μg·mg cat–1 h–1 at −0.15 V versus RHE in H2SO4 (pH = 2) as the electrolyte. The specific NH3 yield is more than 20 times higher than that of C-WO3 (1.1 μg·mg cat–1 h–1 with a FE of 20%). The results exceed most of the reported eNRR performances for TMO-based catalysts. Thus, the synergistic proton intercalation and P doping could lead to newer designs and applications of TMO-based catalysts for improved eNRR while suppressing the competing HER.

Abstract Estimates of oxygen fugacity of eclogitic rocks are linked to the redox evolution of the oceanic protolith during subduction and its residence in the lithospheric mantle, and, based on knowledge of pressures and temperatures, allow modelling of the speciation of volatile elements and diamond (or graphite) versus carbonate stability. To date, the oxygen fugacity of mantle eclogites has been shown to vary between -6 (Kasai, Congo and Udachnaya, Siberia) and -0.1 (Udachnaya, Siberia) log units (relative to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer, FMQ), linked to the low Fe3+ contents of garnets. In this study we investigated the Fe oxidation state of coexisting garnet and clinopyroxene hand-picked out of 17 diamond-free high-MgO and low-MgO mantle eclogites (dated at 2.84 Ga) from the V. Grib kimberlite pipe (East-European platform). Measured Fe3+/∑Fe values range between 0.03 and 0.19 for garnet and 0.18 to 0.38 for clinopyroxene, the former being higher than what was measured previously in garnets equilibrated at mantle conditions. The Fe3+/∑Fe of the reconstructed bulk rock ranges between 0.10 and 0.15 for high-MgO eclogites and 0.10 and 0.24 for low-MgO eclogites (with uncertainties of ± 0.02 and ± 0.03 in both cases). Thermobarometric calculations result in equilibration pressures and temperatures of 3.0 - 5.2 (± 0.4) GPa and 720 - 1050 (± 60) °C for both high-MgO and low-MgO eclogites, slightly lower than previous P-T estimates of mantle eclogites from the Udachnaya kimberlite pipe (Siberian craton). At these conditions, ∆logfo2 (FMQ) calculated using the available oxythermobarometric model varies from -1.7 to -0.6 log units for high-MgO eclogites and from -2.9 to 0.9 log units for low-MgO eclogites. Samples recording ∆logfo2 (FMQ) ≤ -1 log units overlap with North Slave, West Africa and Udachnaya eclogites, with no difference among eclogite types. The average values of -1.2 (± 0.4) log units for high-MgO and -0.6 (± 1.1) log units for low-MgO eclogites suggest different redox conditions of basaltic protoliths during subduction worldwide. Previous geochemical studies on the same rock samples reported evidence of cryptic metasomatism in both garnet and clinopyroxene that we demonstrate being not recorded by their major elements, while modal metasomatism evidenced by the presence of phlogopite as a product of interaction with a kimberlitic melt only affects the MgO of the bulk rock. Therefore, we suggest that high Fe3+/∑Fe ratios for garnet (&gt; 0.10) and for reconstructed bulk rocks in the case of both low-MgO and high-MgO samples cannot be due to metasomatic interaction with an oxidized fluid, but rather are the consequence of Fe3+ redistribution in an unusually oxidized mafic protolith upon metamorphism. Our results highlight the redox variability of eclogites of Archaean age at conditions more oxidized than present-day MORBs and imply an oxidizing nature of the convective mantle source where magma was formed with consequent speciation of C in the form of carbonate fluid explaining, therefore, the lack of diamonds in V. Grib kimberlite pipe.

Background: The retina is a light-sensitive nerve layer located at the back of the eye that creates images of objects. These cells kept alive by getting oxygen and nutrients from tiny blood vessels in the eye. Retinopathy is a disease of the retina that is more prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness because hyperglycemia weakens retinal capillaries, resulting in leakage of blood into the surrounding space. This bleeding can result in formation of scar tissue, which can cause traction retinal detachment and maculopathy. The development of a panel of blood biomarkers to monitor diabetic retinopathies is essential for both diagnosis and prognosis. Proteomics as a powerful tool for the analysis of complex mixtures of proteins and the identification of biomarkers can be of great importance. Purpose: To detect early nerve fiber layer changes around macula and optic disc in diabetic patients, and to correlate diabetic retinopathy with blood antioxidants and gut microbiota in T2DM in Saudi patients. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional case-control study, a total of 77 eyes of 39 subjects aged 40-60 years who did not have any history of eye injuries or eye diseases affecting fundus viewing, were recruited from King Saud University Campus and the department of ophthalmology in King Abdul Aziz university hospital in Riyadh. All subjects underwent full ophthalmic examination including Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular profile, Proteomic approach of collected overnight fasting plasma and Microbial stool examination. Results: The nerve fiber layer thickness around the optic disc was measured for all groups, and there was no statistically significant difference in all quadrants between groups. The total retinal thickness at the macular area was different among all groups and tends to increase in group 3 due to diabetic retinopathy. The macular thickness in the 4 quadrants revealed no statistical difference except in the inferior quadrant. Glutathione S transferase and lipid peroxides showed no significant difference between the three studied groups; vitamin C and Glutathione were surprisingly higher in controlled diabetic patients relative to controls. Moreover, over growth of bacteroids participated to the evolution of retinopathy in diabetic patients. Conclusion: As hyperglycemia and oxidative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, the present study certified that the progressive damage can be delayed in controlled type 2 diabetic patients using different treatment modalities that subside oxidative stress.

Recently, with the help of in-situ PL and GIWAXS measurements, we have shown that the defects are formed mainly at the grain boundaries and surface.1,2 Therefore, it is necessary to selectively passivate surface and grain boundaries. It was shown that the removal of thin surface layers using mechanical,3 or laser4 polishing may improve the performance of perovskite thin films and PCEs. In our work, we performed an initial study examining the effect of the DCSBD (the diffuse coplanar surface barrier discharge) plasma on perovskite thin films. The sample was placed in the vicinity of the plasma and exposed to the plasma for different duration. Using in-situ photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, we found that the exposure of perovskite surface to plasma in nitrogen atmosphere causes the removal of oxygen from perovskite film. We found that, at first, the PL intensity decreased significantly, which is caused by surface defects created by exposure to plasma. However, after this abrupt change, the plasma lines of singly ionized oxygen appear in the spectrum of the plasma, and the PL intensity increases until the oxygen is completely removed. This means that the removal of oxygen has a positive impact on defect densities in perovskite film. However, when completely removed, further exposure to plasma has only a negative impact. We believe this method could be an intermediate step before the deposition of a passivation layer on the perovskite. Additionally, the DCSBD plasma treatment is already used in different industrial applications and thus it is ready for use in large production lines.

Abstract Background and Aims kidney failure is a frequent reason for emergency department (ED) visits. Patients may require emergency hemodialysis and this situation may increases mortality risk. We set out to study the clinical relevance and biological characteristics of patients with renal failure presenting to the emergency department with an indication for emergency hemodialysis. Method A prospective observational study conducted in ED conducted over a 6-month period. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older and suffering from acute or chronic renal insufficiency defined by creatinine clearance (CrCL) calculated by MDRD&lt;60 ml/min. Information is recorded on demographics, clinical profile, clinical presentation, laboratory, causes of for emergency hemodialysis and in-hospital complications. Results Eighty one patients were enrolled, among them 61.7% patients had an indication for emergency hemodialysis. Mean age was 61± 12, sex-ratio=1,7. Sixty seven patients (82.7%) were known to have a chronic kidney failure and 17.3 % were discovered at the emergency department at the same hospitalisation period. Clinical profile (%): Anuric patients (11.1), preserved diuresis (40.7). Clinical presentation (%): deterioration of general condition (35.8), dyspnea and chest pain (21) and fever (17.3). Clinical examination showed a peripheral oxygen saturation between 70 and 100% with a mean of 94.81, a respiratory rhythm mean of 20 cycles/min, a systolic blood pressure mean of 134.61 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure mean of 70 mmHg. biological exams showed that kalemia was between 2.4 and 8.6 and 45 of those patients had kalemia more or equal to 5.5. Twelve per cent of these patients had hyperkalemia signs on the electrocardiogram. The average were 28 mmol/l with a maximum of 83.3 mmol/l. Creatinine values were between 185 et 2620 μmol/l with a median of 81. The value of Ph was between 7.04 and 7.53 with a median of 7.29 mm Hg. The value of HCO3- value was between 4.6 and 28.4 with a median of 14.2. Causes of emergency hemodialysis were acidosis in 12 cases, severe anemia with blood transfusion in 4 cases, hyperkalemia in 10 cases, acute pulmonary oedema in 5 cases and acute renal failure in 6 cases .the evolution of the patients was marked by improvement of 61.7% of the patients, only 3 of the 81 patients died during the hospitalization. Conclusion This study showed that the causes of emergency dialysis can be avoided by improving care and educating patients to improve the prognosis.

&nbsp;In the early generation of the Indian 220 MWe pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR220), Zr-2.5Nb pressure tubes (PT) were manufactured from doublemelted (DM) ingots. Later on, quadruple melted (QM) ingots were used to achieve enhanced performance. These pressure tubes were fabricated by hot extrusion followed by double pilgering with intermediate annealing and this fabrication route is designated as an old route (OR). These tubes have performed reasonably well. However, some of these tubes showed higher in-reactor deformation. Subsequently, both alloy chemistry and manufacturing practice were revisited and changes in alloy chemistry and ingot diameter, mode of hot working for breaking the cast structure and hot extrusion of billets with higher extrusion ratio and single pilgering steps have been employed. This route is designated as a new route (NR) and is being used for manufacturing pressure tubes for the current generation of 220MWe pressurized heavy water reactors. <br><br>Over the years, changes in Chlorine (Cl), Carbon (C), Phosphorous (P), Iron (Fe) and Hydrogen (H) specification and narrowing down the specification for Niobium (Nb) and Oxygen (O) have been implemented to exploit their beneficial effect on in-reactor deformation and hydrogen pickup. The changes in manufacturing practices had resulted in changes in microstructure and texture. In the old route (OR), pressure tube (PT) microstructure was characterized by the presence of discrete beta-phase precipitates along the interfaces of alpha lamellae while the new route (NR) pressure tube (PT) exhibits more continuous beta film and relatively coarser α lamellae. In terms of crystallographic texture too, the new route (NR) pressure tubes (PTs) had higher FT values (in the order of 0.65) in comparison to old route (OR) pressure tubes (PTs) (FT~0.55 to 0.6).<br><br>Because of crystallographic and microstructural anisotropy, the tensile behavior of this material is also anisotropic with the transverse direction exhibiting higher flow stress and lower ductility at and below reactor operating temperatures. The transverse tensile strength of pressure tube (PTs) fabricated from new route (NR) is higher than that fabricated from old route (OR). The fracture toughness of pressure tubes (PT) manufactured from quadruple melted (QM) ingots are significantly higher than that of the pressure tubes (PTs) manufactured from double melted (DM) ingots, which is attributed to the deleterious effect of Chlorine (Cl), Carbon (C), Phosphorous (P) and their complexes. The variation in fracture toughness of pressure tubes (PTs) was evaluated as a function of temperature, hydrogen content and hydride orientation. The hydrided material exhibited a typical S curve showing lower-shelf, transition and upper shelf regimes. Delayed hydride cracking velocity and threshold stress intensity factor were determined as a function of temperature, direction of approach to test temperature and hydride orientation. Threshold stress for hydride reorientation (σth) determined using ex-situ and in-situ methods between 250 and 300oC was observed to decrease with an increase in temperature. Thermal creep behavior was investigated for these tubes at 350, 400 and 450 °C at different stress levels and comparison of the minimum creep rate and the rupture life is presented. This article describes the evolution of the alloy chemistry, microstructural features, texture and mechanical properties and hydride induced embrittlement of the pressure tubes (PTs) used in Indian pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) and life extension approaches. An attempt has been made to rationalize the observed properties in terms of alloy chemistry and microstructure.

In the healthy adult kidney, cellular homeostasis is maintained by the balance between nutrient surplus and nutrient deprivation signaling.1Packer M. Fetal reprogramming of nutrient surplus signaling, O-GlcNAcylation, and the evolution of CKD.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2023; 34: 1480-1491Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar The primary nutrient deprivation signals are sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK), which are activated by low intracellular levels of glucose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and by the oxidation-reduction state, and function to reduce oxidative stress and proinflammatory signaling, thus promoting cellular survival. The primary nutrient surplus signals are mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which are activated by high intracellular levels of glucose to enhance flux through glucose-driven anabolic pathways and to promote maladaptive tubular hypertrophy, oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. Typically, the balancing of nutrient deprivation and surplus pathways maintains kidney health, with nutrient deprivation signals being dominant, thereby ensuring a reduced level of cellular stress that promotes cellular survival, particularly in the proximal renal tubule and glomerular podocytes and mesangial cells. Chronic kidney disease is characterized by an increase in cellular glucose uptake, which triggers upregulation of nutrient surplus signaling (mTOR and HIF-1α) and downregulation of nutrient deprivation signals (SIRT1 and AMPK).1Packer M. Fetal reprogramming of nutrient surplus signaling, O-GlcNAcylation, and the evolution of CKD.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2023; 34: 1480-1491Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar,2Packer M.

Activation of mTOR/HIF-1α and increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway directs glucose away from ATP production and toward anabolic pathways, thus driving proximal tubular cells into the cell cycle. However, under high-workload normoxic conditions, cells driven toward growth exhibit maladaptive dedifferentiation rather than tubular renewal, leading to renal structural and functional disarray.1Packer M.

The ability to produce ATP action is facilitated by an effect of SIRT1 and AMPK to restore mitochondrial health through actions to reduce oxidative stress, enhance mitophagy, and augment mitochondrial biogenesis.4Packer M.

There is considerable experimental evidence to support an effect of SGLT2 inhibitors to restore cytoprotective signaling as the primary mechanism underlying their renoprotective effects (Figure 1).

Empaglifozin prevented podocyte and tubulointerstitial lesions while inhibiting mTOR signaling in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease produced in 5/6 nephrectomized mice. In proximal tubular cells of ApoE-deficient mice subjected to a high-fat diet, mTOR hyperactivation played a critical role in mediating the progression of chronic kidney disease, but this effect was abolished by empagliflozin. Interestingly, the favorable effects of empagliflozin were mimicked by 1,3-butanediol, a ketone body precursor, and the renoprotective effects of empagliflozin were prevented by knockout of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2, the rate-limiting enzyme for ketogenesis. These observations suggested that ketone bodies produced by SGLT2 inhibitors as an effect of starvation mimicry may help to mediate their effects on nutrient surplus and nutrient deprivation signaling. Other investigators have also proposed that ketone bodies may function as metabolic signaling molecules (acting to upregulate SIRT1 and downregulate mTOR) rather than serving as an alternative fuel for the production of ATP.2Packer M. Role of impaired nutrient and oxygen deprivation signaling and deficient autophagic flux in diabetic CKD development: implications for understanding the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2-inhibitors.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2020; 31: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,4Packer M.

Kume S. Sugahara S. et al.SGLT2 inhibition mediates protection from diabetic kidney disease by promoting ketone body-induced mTORC1 inhibition.Cell Metab. 2020; 32: 404-419.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar the increase in proximal tubular ATP production following 1,3-butanediol was related to enhanced oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (rather than ketolysis), the expected result if restoration of cellular energetics was due to an improvement in mitochondrial function. Importantly, these effects have been demonstrated not only in animal models, but in cultured cells, which are not subject to hemodynamic perturbations. It is understood that many nephrologists believe that SGLT2 inhibitors exert renoprotective effects by increasing sodium delivery to the distal nephron and macula densa. The enhanced distal delivery of sodium has been hypothesized to increase distal tubular workload, leading to hypoxia at the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, the augmented delivery to the macula densa might activate tubuloglomerular feedback and reduce intraglomerular filtration pressures, which has been proposed to slow the evolution of chronic kidney disease. However, the results of clinical and experimental studies do not support the pathophysiological importance of these hemodynamic changes. SGLT2 inhibitors do not produce renal medullary hypoxia in patients without diabetes14Zanchi A. Burnier M. Muller M.E. et al.Acute and chronic effects of SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on renal oxygenation and blood pressure control in nondiabetic normotensive subjects: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.J Am Heart Assoc. 2020; 9e016173Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar; instead, the source of increased erythropoietin production and erythrocytosis following SGLT2 inhibition appears to be the activation of SIRT1, which leads to increased expression of hypoxic-inducible factor-2α and erythropoietin production, not only in the kidney but also in the liver. Furthermore, although alleviation of glomerular hyperfiltration might exert renoprotective effects in states of hyperfiltration (i.e., diabetes), patients with heart failure do not have glomerular hyperfiltration, but nevertheless, they show a reduction in major adverse renal outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors in large-scale trials. Interestingly, the finding of a short-term decline in glomerular filtration rate following initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors may be explained by an effect of AMPK upregulation to enhance tubuloglomerular feedback rather than an effect on distal tubular sodium delivery.15Huang D.Y. Gao H. Boini K.M. et al.In vivo stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase enhanced tubuloglomerular feedback but reduced tubular sodium transport during high dietary NaCl intake.Pflugers Arch. 2010; 460: 187-196Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar Taken together, there is a critical mass of experimental evidence that supports a renoprotective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, which is mediated by upregulation of SIRT/1AMPK and downregulation of mTOR/HIF-1α in the proximal tubule and in glomerular podocytes and mesangial cells. These drugs exert consistent effects to mute oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial health, mitigate proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling, and prevent cell death, thus maintaining the normal architecture and physiology of the kidney. Importantly, in numerous experimental studies, these renoprotective effects are abolished if SIRT1/AMPK/autophagy is silenced or if mTOR is overactivated. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors act as modulators of nutrient deprivation and nutrient surplus signaling to restore healthy proximal renal tubular homeostasis and metabolism.
