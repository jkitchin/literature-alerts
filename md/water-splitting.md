Fabricating efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for water electrocatalysis. Herein, the spinel-type high-entropy oxides of (Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr)3O4 were synthesized through the high-temperature calcination approach. The influences of calcination temperatures on structures and electrochemical properties were investigated. The optimized catalyst of HEO-900 contains the hybrid structure of regular polyhedrons and irregular nanoparticles, which is beneficial for the exposure of electrochemically active sites. It was identified that the abundant high-valence metal species of Ni3+, Co3+, Fe3+, Mn4+, and Cr3+ are formed during the OER process, which is generally regarded as the electrochemically active sites for OER. Because of the synergistic effect of multi-metal active sites, the optimized HEO-900 catalyst indicates excellent OER activity, which needs the overpotential of 366 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, HEO-900 reveals the prominent durability of running for 24 h at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 without clear delay. Therefore, this work supplies a promising route for preparing high-performance multi-metal OER electrocatalysts for water electrocatalysis application.

The oxygen evolution within photosystem II (PSII) is one of the most enigmatic processes occurring in nature. It is suggested that external proteins surrounding the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) not only stabilize it and provide an appropriate ionic environment but also create water channels, which could be involved in triggering the ingress of water and the removal of O2 and protons outside the system. To investigate the influence of these proteins on the rate of oxygen release and the efficiency of OEC function, we developed a measurement protocol for the direct measurement of the kinetics of oxygen release from PSII using a Joliot-type electrode. PSII-enriched tobacco thylakoids were used in the experiments. The results revealed the existence of slow and fast modes of oxygen evolution. This observation is model-independent and requires no specific assumptions about the initial distribution of the OEC states. The gradual removal of exogenous proteins resulted in a slowdown of the rapid phase (~ms) of O2 release and its gradual disappearance while the slow phase (~tens of ms) accelerated. The role of external proteins in regulating the biphasicity and efficiency of oxygen release is discussed based on observed phenomena and current knowledge.

The development of a low-cost and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode is of critical importance for water electrolysis technologies. The general approach to achieving a high-efficiency OER electrode is to regulate catalytic material structures by synthetic control. Here we reported an orthogonal approach to obtaining the OER electrode without intentional design and synthesis, namely, recycling MnO

Introduction: The development of cost-effective and efficient catalysts plays a pivotal role in the realization of hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting. Method: In this study, two-dimensional NiCo2S4 nanosheets weresynthesized usinga hydrothermal method followed by a sulfidation process. Results: The resulting materials were thoroughly characterized to understand their morphology and structure. The findings indicate that the NiCo2S4 nanosheets exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity and a high density of pores, which facilitate electrolyte infiltration and interfacial charge transfer during electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, the incorporation of S2− modulates the electronic structure of metal ions, reducing the oxidation potential of metal sites and promoting the surface reconstruction of the electrode to form active species. Electrochemical tests conducted in a 1 M KOH solution using the synthesized catalyst as the working electrode demonstrate an overpotential of merely 280 mV and 300 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 and 40 mA cm−2 , respectively, which are much lower than those of NiCo-LDH electrodes (360 mV and 410 mV). Conclusion: Furthermore, the NiCo2S4 electrode delivers a remarkably low Tafel slope of 47.9 mV dec−1 . This investigation presents a novel approach to the development of efficient transition metal-based electrocatalysts.

Developing advanced catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable hydrogen production. This study introduces a novel, multi-stage machine learning (ML) approach to streamline the discovery and optimization of complex multi-metallic catalysts. Our method integrates data mining, active learning, and domain adaptation throughout the materials discovery process. Unlike traditional trial-and-error methods, this approach systematically narrows the exploration space using domain knowledge with minimized reliance on subjective intuition. Then the active learning module efficiently refines element composition and synthesis conditions through iterative experimental feedback. The process culminated in the discovery of a promising Ru-Mn-Ca-Pr oxide catalyst. Our workflow also enhances theoretical simulations with domain adaptation strategy, providing deeper mechanistic insights aligned with experimental findings. By leveraging diverse data sources and multiple ML strategies, we establish an efficient pathway for electrocatalyst discovery and optimization. This comprehensive, data-driven approach represents a paradigm shift and potentially new benchmark in electrocatalysts research.

Abstract The photoelectrochemical performance of Ta 3 N 5 photoanodes is strongly impacted by the presence of shallow and deep defects within the bandgap. However, the role of such states in defining stability under operational conditions is not well understood. Here, a highly controllable synthesis approach is used to create homogenous Ta 3 N 5 thin films with tailored defect concentrations to establish the relationship between atomic‐scale point defects and macroscale stability. Reduced oxygen contents increase long‐range structural order but lead to high concentrations of deep‐level states, while higher oxygen contents result in reduced structural order but beneficially passivate deep‐level defects. Despite the different defect properties, the synthesized photoelectrodes degrade similarly under water oxidation conditions due to the formation of a surface oxide layer that blocks interfacial hole injection and accelerates charge recombination. In contrast, under ferrocyanide oxidation conditions, it is found that Ta 3 N 5 films with high oxygen concentrations exhibit long‐term stability, whereas those possessing lower oxygen contents and higher deep‐level defect concentrations rapidly degrade. These results indicate that deep‐level defects result in rapid trapping of photocarriers and surface oxidation but that shallow oxygen donors can be introduced into Ta 3 N 5 to enable kinetic stabilization of the interface.

Alkaline water electrolysis, which relies on efficient and durable electrocatalysts made from earth-abundant metals like nickel for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, is a crucial energy storage technology for the transition to renewable energy. In operando techniques enabling the observation of active catalysts under relevant working conditions by monitoring the surface oxidation state and local atomic-structure transformation, can probe the active sites and promote fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms. In this study we present a new operando investigation of the electrocatalyst NiGraf by synchrotron X-ray Powder Diffraction and Pair Distribution Function. The structural changes in the crystal phases of this new metal organic alloy comprised of graphene oxide entrapped in nickel-based jamborite nanoparticles during voltammetry cycles in the OER range revealed a first reversible variation in the distance between GO planes during the reaction, and the subsequent reaching of the irreversible activation stage of the electrocatalyst. The technique, which couples Pair Distribution Function, Principal Component Analysis and operando electrochemistry is a new tool for the study of electrocatalysts in action.

Abstract Developing efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting is of great significance for realizing sustainable energy conversion. In this work, Ru sub‐nanoclusters anchored on cobalt‐nickel bimetallic phosphides (Ru‐CoP/Ni 2 P) are constructed by an interfacial confinement strategy. Remarkably, Ru‐CoP/Ni 2 P with low noble metal loading (33.1 µg cm −2 ) shows superior activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in all pH values, whose turnover frequency (TOF) is 8.7, 15.3, and 124.7 times higher than that of Pt/C in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, it only requires the overpotential of 171 mV@10 mA cm −2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and corresponding TOF is 20.3 times higher than that of RuO 2 . More importantly, the Ru‐CoP/Ni 2 P||Ru‐CoP/Ni 2 P displays superior mass activity of 4017 mA mg noble metal −1 at 2.0 V in flowing alkaline water electrolyzer, which is 105.1 times higher than that of Pt/C||IrO 2 . In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the Ru sites in Ru‐CoP/Ni 2 P play a key role for water splitting and follow the adsorption evolution mechanism toward OER. Further mechanism studies disclose the confined Ru atom contributes to the desorption of H 2 during HER and the formation of O‐O bond during OER, leading to fast reaction kinetics. This study emphasizes the importance of interface confinement for enhancing electrocatalytic activity.

The abundant, active, and acidic‐stable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are rare to the proton exchange membrane‐based water electrolysis. Mn‐based materials show promise as electrocatalysts for OER in acid electrolytes. However, the relationship between the stability, activity and structure of Mn‐based catalysts in acidic environments remains unclear. In this study, phase‐pure MnSb2O6 was successfully prepared and investigated as a catalyst for OER in a sulfuric acid solution (pH of 2.0). A comprehensive mechanistic comparison between MnSb2O6 and Mn3O4 revealed that the rate‐determining step for OER on MnSb2O6 is the direct formation of MnIV=O from MnII−H2O by the 2H+/2e− process. This process avoids the rearrangement of adjacent MnIII intermediates, leading to outstanding stability and activity.

Abstract Effective integration of multiple active moieties and strategic engineering of coordinated interfacial junctions are crucial for optimizing the reaction kinetics and intrinsic activities of heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, a simple integrated heterostructure of biphasic Co 0.7 Fe 0.3 /Fe 3 C embedded on in situ grown N‐doped carbon sheets is constructed. Rationally designed CoFe/Fe 3 C‐T 2 owns more accessible active sites and interfacial junction effects, cooperatively boosting the electron and mass transfer, needed for multifunctional electrocatalysis. Leveraging the synergistic effect of dual active sites, CoFe/Fe 3 C‐T 2 demonstrates outstanding oxygen electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium with an ultra‐low potential gap of 0.58 V, surpassing the recently available state‐of‐the‐art catalysts. Moreover, CoFe/Fe 3 C‐T 2 air‐electrode achieves a high peak power density of 249 mW cm −2 , a large specific capacity of 808 mAh g −1 and excellent cycling stability for aqueous Zn‐air batteries. Remarkably, the solid‐state flexible ZAB also exhibits satisfactory performance, showcasing an open‐circuit voltage of 1.43 V and a peak power density of 66 mW cm −2 . These outstanding results push this catalyst to the top of the list of non‐noble metal‐based electrode materials. This work offers a viable method for using the active‐site‐uniting strategy to create double‐active‐site catalysts, which may find real‐time applications in energy conversion/storage devices.

Abstract The development of active, stable, and cost‐effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is crucial for proton‐exchange‐membrane water electrolysis. Inspired by theoretical screening on a series of transition metal incorporated RuO 2 systems, a low Ru‐content solid solution oxide (Ru 0.48 Mn 0.52 O 2 ) achieved is fabricated by a simple two‐step synthesis method through the combination of rutile RuO 2 and β‐MnO 2 . The Ru 0.48 Mn 0.52 O 2 catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low overpotential of 154 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and maintains a high stability under a high current of 100 mA cm −2 for 50 h in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the obtained catalyst exhibits sustained stability at a large current of 0.5 A cm −2 for at least 50 h when loaded onto a Ti felt. The in‐situ characterization results indicate that Ru 0.48 Mn 0.52 O 2 preferably followed the adsorbate evolution mechanism rather than the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism during the OER process, contributing to its high activity and stability at large current densities in acidic media.

The electro‐Fenton (EF) process is an advanced oxidation technology with significant potential; however, it is limited by two steps: generation and activation of H2O2. In contrast to the production of H2O2 via the electrochemical two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the electrochemical three‐electron (3e‐) ORR can directly activate molecular oxygen to yield the hydroxyl radical (·OH), thus breaking through the conceptual and operational limitations of the traditional EF reaction. Therefore, the 3e‐ ORR is a vital process for efficiently producing ·OH in situ, thus charting a new path toward the development of green water‐treatment technologies. This review summarizes the characteristics and mechanisms of the 3e‐ ORR, focusing on the basic principles and latest progress in the in situ generation and efficient utilization of ·OH through the modulation of the reaction pathway, shedding light on the rational design of 3e‐ ORR catalysts, mechanistic exploration, and practical applications for water treatment. Finally, the future developments and challenges of efficient, stable, and large‐scale utilization of ·OH are discussed based on achieving optimal 3e‐ ORR regulation and the potential to combine it with other technologies.

Electrocatalytic water splitting provides an efficient method for the production of hydrogen. In electrocatalytic water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a kinetically sluggish four-electron transfer process, which limits the efficiency of electrocatalytic water splitting. Therefore, it is urgent to develop highly active OER catalysts to accelerate reaction kinetics. Coupling single atoms and clusters in one system is an innovative approach for developing efficient catalysts that can synergistically optimize the adsorption and configuration of intermediates and improve catalytic activity. However, research in this area is still scarce. Herein, we constructed a heterogeneous single-atom cluster system by anchoring Ir single atoms and Co clusters on the surface of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets. Ir single atoms and Co clusters synergistically improved the catalytic activity toward the OER. Specifically, Co<sub><i>n</i></sub>Ir<sub>1</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> required an overpotential of 255 mV at a current density of 10 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup>, which was 60 mV and 67 mV lower than those of Co<sub><i>n</i></sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Ir<sub>1</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The turnover frequency of Co<sub><i>n</i></sub>Ir<sub>1</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> was 0.49 s<sup>−1</sup>, which was 4.9 times greater than that of Co<sub><i>n</i></sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> at an overpotential of 300 mV.

Two newly derived coordination polymers of Cu(II) and Co(II), namely {[Cu(μ‐5‐AzIA)(Py) 2 ]⋅[Cu(5‐AzIA)(Py) 2 (H 2 O)]} n ( CP1 ) and {[Co(μ‐5‐AzIA) 2 (Py) 4 ]⋅[Co(5‐AzIA)(Py) 2 ]} n ( CP2 ) ( 5‐AzIA 2− = 5‐azidoisophthalate; Py = pyridine) are synthesized and structurally characterized by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction (SXRD), powder X‐ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared data. As evident from thermogravimetric data, CP1 loses coordinated water at 110°C and the final residue reaches at 530°C as CuO; CP2 is stable up to 150°C, and the final residue reaches at 415°C as Co 2 O 3 . 5‐AzIA 2− serves as both chelating and monodentate carboxylate bridging ligand to the adjacent metal centers ( Cu(II) in CP1 and Co(II) in CP2 ) to construct the CPs . The CPs form eight‐member carboxylato bridging, [M 2 (RCOO) 2 ], and coordinate with Py rings and assemblage through π‐‐‐π interaction. The magnetic measurements of the CPs show antiferromagnetic super‐exchange properties. Interestingly, CP2 shows field‐induced magnetic ordering at a higher magnetic field at a temperature ̴ 2 K owing to the π•••π stacking between the flagging pyridine moieties. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) shows excellent catalytic effectiveness of CP2 than CP1 with reference to standard RuO 2 catalyst. The comparative catalytic activity of CP1 and CP2 was thoroughly investigated and well supported by Tafel slope, charge‐transfer resistance (Rct), and electrochemically active surface area calculation.

Abstract The performance of MoOx based devices is highly influenced by the presence of oxygen vacancies and the trap density at the oxide-semiconductor interface. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the surface states present at the MoOx/c-Si interface through capacitance and conductance methods. Thin films of MoOx were deposited on n-Si using DC reactive sputtering of Mo under varying oxygen flow rates and studied the modulation of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) device parameters using appropriate analysis methods. The capacitance-voltage (CV) analysis reveals the formation of nearly dielectric films at an intermediate oxygen flow rate of 15 sccm, exhibiting a dielectric constant of 24 and negative fixed charges of approximately 1.81x1012 cm-2. Work function evaluated from the Kelvin probe measurements was found to be maximum of 5.08 eV for the films deposited at the intermediate oxygen flow rate of 15 sccm. Furthermore, admittance analysis was performed on all the films to determine the loss mechanism in different regions, ranging from inversion to accumulation. Parallel conductance for different bias conditions was studied and observed the domination of oxide traps at the higher oxygen flow (> 20 sccm). Investigation of deep level defects were performed using the deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) in the temperature range of 100 K to 475 K, along with the C-V measurements. A transition in C-V behavior was observed below room temperature that shows the minority carrier response time is controlled by generation-recombination at low temperatures and by diffusion at high temperatures. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed that the films are sub-stoichiometric with the dominant oxidation state of Mo+6. The results have been discussed and presented in detail.&#xD;

The band gap constraint of the photocatalyst for overall water splitting limits the utilization of solar energy. A strategy to broaden the range of light absorption is employing a two-dimensional (2D) polar material as photocatalyst, benefiting from the deflection of the energy level due to their intrinsic internal electric field. Here, by using first-principles computational screening, we search for 2D polar semiconductors for photocatalytic water splitting from both ground- and excited-state perspectives. Applying a unique electronic structure model of polar materials, there are 13 photocatalyst candidates for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 8 candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) without barrier energies from the perspective of the ground-state free energy variation calculation. In particular, Cu

Abstract Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and their composites are promising non-platinum electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. But traditional methods to obtain these electrocatalysts are usually multi-step and include the participation of hazardous phosphorus compounds during phosphidation. Here, the possibility of using a polyaniline doped with phosphoric acid (PANI∙H3PO4) – as a source of C, N and P simultaneously - to obtain composites based on N,P-doped carbon and nano- and/or submicron TMP particles as HER, OER and ORR electrocatalysts is demonstrated. The pyrolysis of PANI∙H3PO4 together with Co, Ni, Mo, or Fe salt allows the formation of such composite electrocatalysts by the carbon thermal reduction route. Regardless of the pH of the electrolyte, the MoP-based electrocatalyst is characterized in HER by the smallest Tafel slope and overpotential of hydrogen evolution and also exhibits high stability during long-term operation. At the same time, other composites are multifunctional electrocatalysts possessing activity not only in HER, but also in OER and ORR. The proposed approach can be a starting point for a simple, universal in choice of d-metal, and environmentally attractive preparation of multifunctional TMP-based electrocatalysts with further improvement of their performance.

ABSTRACT A novel electrically chargeable galvanic system is presented that efficiently stores energy in the form of zinc and releases hydrogen and electricity upon discharge. In this concept, oxygen is released at the gas electrode during charging, and zinc oxide is reduced to metallic zinc at the counter electrode. When the cell is discharged on demand, the zinc is converted back to zinc oxide, but the water is reduced at the gas electrode to produce hydrogen. The system can therefore be used not only to store electricity—in combination with a fuel cell—but also as an on‐demand hydrogen generator, for example, for industrial use. When used as an electrical storage system, the overall round‐trip efficiency can approach 50%, significantly exceeding the efficiency of alternative power‐to‐gas technologies. There are no hydrogen storage or transportation losses. The electrochemical cell combines two breakthrough technologies: a bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction that survives thousands of oxidation and reduction cycles, and a dendrite‐free deposition of thick, high‐capacity zinc coatings that can be cycled almost indefinitely thanks to pulsed charge current and intelligent electronic control.

Abstract Lattice‐confined single‐atom catalyst (LC SAC), featuring exceptional activity, intriguing stability and prominent selectivity, has attracted extensive attention in the fields of various reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), etc.). To design a “smart” LC SAC for catalytic applications, one must systematically comprehend updated advances in the preparation, the application, and especially the peculiar electron regulation mechanism of LC SAC. In this review, the specific preparation methods of LC SAC based on general coordination strategy are updated, and its applications in HER, OER, ORR, N 2 reduction reaction (NRR), advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and so forth are summarized to display outstanding activity, stability and selectivity. Uniquely, the electron regulation mechanisms are first and deeply discussed and can be primarily categorized as electron transfer bridge with monometallic active sites, novel catalytic centers with polymetallic active sites, and positive influence by surrounding environments. In the end, the existing issues and future development directions are put forward with a view to further optimize the performance of LC SAC. This review is expected to contribute to the in‐depth understanding and practical application of highly efficient LC SAC.

Abstract In the present work a facile method was adopted for the fabrication of highly active and dimensionally stable cobalt-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based composite electrode for OER process. The metal loading and the amount of graphene was optimized for better performance of the electrode. The development of these type of electrodes is noteworthy taking the advantage of the method and the materials used. The morphology and the composition were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS). Spectroscopic characterization was done using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. Electrochemical characterization revealed excellent electro-catalytic activity of the prepared electrode and strongly suggest synergistic reaction between Co3O4 and rGO. The developed electrode can realize excellent Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) activity in alkaline media with low over potential and low tafel slope with long-term stability as evidenced from various analysis.

Extensive research is underway to achieve carbon neutrality through the production of green hydrogen via water electrolysis, powered by renewable energy. Polymer membrane water electrolyzers, such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE), are at the forefront of this research. Developing highly active and durable electrode catalysts is very important for commercializing these electrolyzers. However, most research is conducted in half‐cell setups, which may not fully represent the catalysts' effectiveness in membrane‐electrode‐assembly (MEA) devices. This review explores the catalysts developed for high‐performance PEMWE and AEMWE MEA systems. Only the catalysts reporting the MEA performance were discussed in this review. In PEMWE, strategies aim to minimize Ir use for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by maximizing activity, employing metal oxide‐based supports, integrating secondary elements into IrOx lattices, or exploring non‐Ir materials. For AEMWE, the emphasis is on enhancing the performance of NiFe‐based and Co‐based catalysts by improving electrical conductivity and mass transport. Pt‐based and Ni‐based catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in AEMWE are also examined. Additionally, this review discusses the unique considerations for catalysts operating in pure water within AEMWE systems.

Abstract Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R‐PCECs) are very promising as energy conversion and storage devices with high efficiency at intermediate temperatures (500–700 °C). Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics on air electrodes severely hamper the commercial application of R‐PCECs. In this work, an In‐doped PrBaCo 2 O 5+δ air electrode is developed with a designed formula of PrBaCo 1.9 In 0.1 O 5+δ , which however consists of a dominated double perovskite PrBa 0.95 Co 1.85 In 0.09 O 5+δ and a minor cubic perovskite BaCo 0.85 In 0.15 O 3‐δ phase, as suggested by the XRD refinements. The formation of nanocomposites induced by the In‐doping has markedly improved the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due likely to the increased oxygen vacancies, enhanced the oxygen surface exchange and bulk diffusion capabilities when compared to the bare PrBaCo 2 O 5+δ . Excellent electrochemical performances in fuel cell (FC) mode (2.25 W cm −2 ) and electrolysis cell (EC) mode (−4.41 A cm −2 at 1.3 V) are achieved on the single cells with such nanocomposite air electrodes at 700 °C. In addition, promising durability tests of cells in modes of FC (100 h), EC (100 h), and cycling (210 h) are demonstrated at 600 °C. This In‐doped strategy provides a novel approach to developing new air electrode materials.

Abstract Replacing the slow protonation process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the fast protonation of alcohol electro‐oxidation can decrease the driving potentials, thus improving overall efficiency of electrochemical devices. However, the formation of effective catalytic sites for alcohol oxidation remains challenging in accelerating protonation to inhibit metal leaching and improve catalyst stability. Herein, asymmetric Ni‐O‐Cr sites are constructed by alloying Cr into the NiO matrix to optimize coordination environments, showing significantly enhanced stability during alcohol electro‐oxidation. The asymmetric Ni‐O‐Cr can maintain constant valence states of Cr and Ni during alcohol oxidation, efficiently suppressing metal dissolution even at high oxidation potentials. In situ electrochemical characterizations combined with theoretical calculations indicate that asymmetric Ni‐O‐Cr can improve adsorption and activation of OH* and alcohol molecules compared to pure NiO, thus increasing anodic kinetics. The theoretical results also indicate that the smaller gap of Ni 3 d ‐O 2 p in asymmetric Ni‐O‐Cr strengthens charge transfer, leading to fast protonation of catalytic sites with enhanced stability. This work gives insights into boosting anodic protonation using asymmetric sites‐enriched solid‐solution electrocatalysts.

Abstract Facing the resource and environmental pressures brought by the retiring wave of lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), direct recycling methods are considered to be the next generation's solution. However, the contradiction between limited battery life and the demand for rapidly iterating technology forces the direct recovery paradigm to shift toward “direct upcycling.” Herein, a closed‐loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt system is utilized to repair structural defects in degraded polycrystalline LiNi 0.83 Co 0.12 Mn 0.05 O 2 cathodes while achieving single‐crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual‐doping. Upcycled materials can effectively overcome the two key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution. It exhibits comprehensive electrochemical performance far superior to commercial materials at 4.6 V, especially its fast charging capability at 15 C, and an impressive 91.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles in a 1.2 Ah pouch cell. Importantly, this approach demonstrates broad applicability to various spent layered cathodes, particularly showcasing its value in the recycling of mixed spent cathodes. This work effectively bridges the gap between waste management and material performance enhancement, offering a sustainable path for the recycling of spent LIBs and the production of next‐generation high‐voltage cathodes.

Abstract The poor carrier separation capability and sluggish water oxidation reaction kinetics are two critical factors that impact the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance of the bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) photoanode. Previous studies have demonstrated that doping with rare‐earth elements to induce lattice distortions and loading oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co‐catalysts are effective strategies for enhancing carrier separation capabilities and accelerating the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction. Herein, Cu 2+ ‐doped RuO 2 (Cu‐RuO 2 ) particles are anchored onto rare earth element Thulium (Tm)‐doped BiVO 4 (Tm‐BiVO 4 ) photoanode substrates, constructing an integrated Cu‐RuO 2 ‐Tm‐BiVO 4 photoanode. The newly integrated photoanode not only achieves a photocurrent density of 5.3 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE), but also exhibits exceptional stability. A series of detailed physical and chemical characterizations as well as density‐functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Tm doping induces lattice distortion in BiVO 4 , enhancing the internal electric field and thereby facilitating carrier separation. Moreover, the anchored Cu‐RuO 2 particles not only lattice‐match with the Tm‐BiVO 4 photoanode, reducing interfacial transfer resistance, but also expedite the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction. The profound significance of this work is that it offers a reference for the future design and fabrication of novel integrated photoanodes.

Despite the current prominence of cobalt oxides as the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), there is a lack of unambiguous demonstration for the presence and the role of Co4+ prior to/during the OER. Here, we combine electrochemistry with in situ UV-Vis spectroscopy to investigate and discuss the previously unaddressed effect of different electrolyte pH in the range from pH 12.2 to pH 14.0 on the population of Co4+ in thin films of CoOx and its concomitant impact on their OER performance. Our UV-Vis spectroscopic findings indicate that, not only can the overall redox conversion of Co be qualitatively monitored as a function of potential and pH, but also the Co3+ oxidation assigned to a peak at 800 nm can be more quantitatively tracked in situ via stepped potential spectroelectrochemistry; with their optical signals becoming stronger at higher electrolyte pH within Co3+/ Co4+ conversion region, which is consistent with voltammetric observations that manifest heightened Co3+ oxidation current, indicating an enhancement in Co oxidation state and the consequent predominance of Co4+ under elevated pH conditions. Furthermore, the OER activity shows a positive correlation with Co4+ density (i.e., with electrolyte pH) in the potential region that is higher than 1.57 VRHE, leading to a non-zero OH- reaction order on RHE scale in the same region. This study not only provides spectral insight into the redox chemistry of Co at OER-relevant potentials but also highlights the importance of Co4+ in facilitating the alkaline OER at high pH and current densities.

Abstract The eruption of Nova V2891 Cygni in 2019 offers a rare opportunity to explore the shock-induced processes in novae ejecta. The spectral evolution shows noticeable differences in the evolution of various oxygen emission lines such as O i 7773 Å, O i 8446 Å, O i 1.1286 μm, O i 1.3164 μm, etc. Here, we use spectral synthesis code cloudy to study the temporal evolution of these oxygen emission lines. Our photoionization model requires the introduction of a component with a very high density (n ∼ 1011 cm−3) and an enhanced oxygen abundance (O/H ∼ 28) to produce the O i 7773 Å emission line, suggesting a stratification of material with high oxygen abundance within the ejecta. An important outcome is the behaviour of the O i 1.3164 μm line, which could only be generated by invoking the collisional ionization models in cloudy. Our phenomenological analysis suggests that O i 1.3164 μm emission originates from a thin, dense shell characterized by a high density of about 1012.5 − 1012.8 cm−3, which is most likely formed due to the strong internal collisions. If such is the case, the O i 1.3164 μm emission presents itself as a tracer of shock-induced dust formation in V2891 Cyg. The collisional ionization models have also been successful in creating the high-temperature conditions (∼7.07 − 7.49 × 105 K) required to reproduce the observed high ionization potential coronal lines, which coincide with the epoch of dust formation and evolution of the O i 1.3164 μm emission line.

Abstract Achieving a high dispersity of deposited transition metal is crucial in the anodization preparation of noble‐metal‐free composites for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Herein, for the first time, an in situ ion pumping anodization method is proposed to confine single‐atom Fe within the spatially ordered structure of anodized TiO 2 nanotubes (TNT), assisted by ferric sodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an “ion pump” to deliver Fe 3+ toward anodes. Both experimental and theoretical calculations confirm that highly dispersed single‐atom Fe can interact with single‐electron‐trapped oxygen vacancies (SETOV), effectively reducing the oxygen vacancy concentration in TiO 2 nanotubes. This reduction promotes efficient charge carrier separation through the Fe(III)/Fe(II) pathway and enhances hydrogen desorption, ultimately boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

The present work, which has been carried out in the framework of EEA project BLUE-GREENWAY, is a contribution to the study of the evolution of hypoxia/anoxia in Aitoliko lagoon, Greece. The study area suffers from anoxia which is a very important environmental problem lately mainly due to anthropogenic activities. Unpublished data from two measurement campaigns (2013–2014, 2023) have been used, and a 3D ocean model (SINMOD) has been configured for the region, that couples hydrodynamics, biochemistry and ecology. The analysis of model results includes monthly, annual and interannual variability of fields of dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, density, currents and wind as well as Brunt-Väisala frequency and Richardson number. Main results concerning oxygen are: a) the lagoon shows anoxic behavior at 5–7 m depth with a seasonal dependence, b) the seasonal variability in the upper water column with deeper ventilation during winter when the surface stratification is weaker than that during summer, c) anoxic water is reaching the surface of the lagoon for a short period of time.

In order to solve the problems of conventional water injection development difficulties and low recovery factor in low-permeability reservoirs, the method of high-pressure air drive is adopted to achieve the purpose of reservoir energy enhancement and efficiency improvement. This paper conducted an experimental study on the mechanism of low-temperature oxidation (LTO) for crude oil in the process of high-pressure air flooding, elaborated the relationship between the LTO properties of crude oil and the temperature, pressure, and water saturation of the reservoir, and analyzed the differences in LTO oxygen consumption and oil components under different reaction conditions. In addition, combined with the air flooding physical simulation experiment, the dynamic evolution law of recovery rate in the air flooding process was revealed. Findings from this inquiry indicate that an escalation in the oxidation temperature significantly amplifies the oxygen incorporation reaction within the crude oil matrix. This augmentation in oxidative conditions leads to an uptick in oxygen consumption, which subsequently precipitates a reduction in the lighter fractions of the oxidized oil while enriching its heavier components. Elevated pressures were found to enhance the propensity for the amalgamation of unstable hydrocarbons with oxygen, fostering comprehensive and heterogeneous oxidation reactions. Notably, an excessive presence of water was observed to detrimentally affect the thermal efficacy of crude oil oxidation processes. In the context of low-permeability reservoirs, air injection techniques have emerged as superior in effectuating oil displacement, although an increase in injection pressures has been associated with the phenomenon of gas channeling. Interestingly, adopting a sequential strategy of initiating water flooding before air flooding facilitated the conveyance of high-pressure air via established flushing channels, although it appeared to attenuate the intensity of crude oil oxidation, culminating in an oil recovery efficiency peaking at 51%.

The delayed eukaryote evolution during the mid-Proterozoic may have been linked to prolonged low oxygen levels during this period. Two short oxygenation events have recently been identified at ca. 1.57 Ga and ca. 1.4 Ga, but the redox conditions during the intervening interval remain poorly constrained. In this study, we conducted mineralogical and geochemical investigations on three sections of the Wumishan Formation (ca. 1.52−1.47 Ga) that were deposited between the two oxygenation events in the Yanliao basin. The results revealed two distinct changes in carbonate mineralogy and precipitation style associated with concurrent changes in carbonate I/(Ca + Mg): a transition from intervals with positive I/(Ca + Mg) anomalies and abundant water-column carbonate mud to intervals with no I/(Ca + Mg) anomalies and abundant seafloor precipitates, suggesting a shift from suboxic to anoxic conditions in shallow seawater. In both of the suboxic intervals, I/(Ca + Mg) values reached 0.5−2.6 μmol/mol, with negative Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce*(SN) = 0.69; data from literature) occurring in the later interval (ca. 1.48 Ga). The results suggest significant redox fluctuations in the shallow seawater during the Mesoproterozoic. However, these pulsed oxygenation episodes may not have been sufficient to sustain the continuous evolution of early eukaryotes.

Until the late 20th century, the idea of identifying wildfires in deep time was not generally accepted. One of the basic problems was the fact that charcoal-like wood fragments, so often found in sedimentary rocks and in coals, were termed fusain and, in addition, many researchers could not envision wildfires in peat-forming systems. The advent of Scanning Electron Microscopy and studies on modern charcoals and fossil fusains demonstrated beyond doubt that wildfire residues may be recognized in rocks dating back to at least 350 million years. Increasing numbers of studies on modern and fossil charcoal assemblages from the 1970s through the 1990s established the potential importance of wildfires in the fossil record, using Carboniferous examples in particular. Since the 1990s, extensive progress has been made in understanding modern wildfires and their byproducts. New techniques to study ancient charcoals have allowed considerable progress to be made to integrate modern and ancient fire studies, both before and after the evolution of mankind. Four important developments have made a reassessment of Carboniferous wildfires necessary: the recognition of the role of atmospheric oxygen in controlling the occurrence of wildfire; the development of new microscopical techniques allowing more detailed anatomical data to be obtained from charcoal; the integration of molecular studies with the evolution of fire traits; and new developments in or understanding of post-fire erosion/deposition systems.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health crisis and there is an urgent need to better understand AMR mechanisms. Antibiotic treatment alters several aspects of bacterial physiology, including increased ATP utilization, carbon metabolism, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. However, how the "bioenergetic stress" induced by increased ATP utilization affects treatment outcomes is unknown. Here we utilized a synthetic biology approach to study the direct effects of bioenergetic stress on antibiotic efficacy. We engineered a genetic system that constitutively hydrolyzes ATP or NADH in Escherichia coli. We found that bioenergetic stress potentiates AMR evolution via enhanced ROS production, mutagenic break repair, and transcription-coupled repair. We also find that bioenergetic stress potentiates antimicrobial persistence via potentiated stringent response activation. We propose a unifying model that antibiotic-induced antimicrobial resistance and persistence is caused by antibiotic-induced. This has important implications for preventing or curbing the spread of AMR infections.

Abstract Cancer is a serious public health issue and cases are rising at a high rate around the world. Altered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress (OS) which plays a vital role in cancer development by disrupting signaling pathways and genomic integrity in the cellular microenvironment. In this study, we reviewed the regulation of noncoding RNAs, histone modifications, and DNA methylation which OS is involved in. These mechanisms promote cancer growth, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. There is significant potential to improve patient outcomes through the development of customized medications and interventions that precisely address the role of OS in the onset and progression of cancer. Redox-modulating drugs, antioxidant-based therapies, and measures to restore regular cellular activity and OS-modulated signaling pathways are some examples of these strategies. One other hypothesis rationalizes the cancer-suppressing effect of OS, which acts as a two-edged condition that warns against the use of antioxidants for cancer treatment and management. The present study was executed to review the impact of OS on epigenetic machinery, the evolution of metastatic cancer, and how OS mediates cellular signaling. Along with, insights into the potential of targeting OS-mediated mechanisms for cancer therapy.

Understanding the chemical enrichment of different elements is crucial to gaining a complete picture of galaxy chemical evolution. In this study, we present a new sample of 46 low-redshift, low-mass star-forming galaxies at $M_*\sim 10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$ along with two quiescent galaxies at $M_*\sim 10^{8.8}M_{\odot}$ observed with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI), aiming to investigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in the transition zone between Local Group satellites and massive field galaxies. We develop a novel method to simultaneously determine stellar abundances of iron and magnesium in star-forming galaxies. With the gas-phase oxygen abundance (O/H)$_{\rm g}$ measured using the strong line method, we are able to make the first-ever apples-to-apples comparison of $\alpha$ elements in the stars and the ISM. We find that the [Mg/H]$_*$-[O/H]$_{\rm g}$ relation is much tighter than the [Fe/H]$_*$-[O/H]$_{\rm g}$ relation, which can be explained by the similar production processes of $\alpha$ elements. Most galaxies in our sample exhibit higher [O/H]$_{\rm g}$ than [Fe/H]$_*$ and [Mg/H]$_*$. In addition, we construct mass-metallicity relations (MZRs) measured as three different elements (Fe$_*$, Mg$_*$, O$_{\rm g}$). Compared to the gas O-MZR, the stellar Fe- and Mg-MZRs show larger scatter driven by variations in specific star formation rates (sSFR), with star-forming galaxies exhibiting higher sSFR and lower stellar abundances at fixed mass. The excess of [O/H]$_{\rm g}$ compared to stellar abundances as well as the anti-correlation between sSFR and stellar abundance suggests that galaxy quenching of intermediate-mass galaxies at $M_*\sim 10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$ is primarily driven by starvation.

<p>Extracting and analyzing data from smartphones, IoT devices, and drones is crucial for conducting digital crime investigations. Effective cyberattack mitigation necessitates the use of advanced Android mobile forensics techniques. The investigation necessitates proficiency in manual, logical, hex dump, chip-off, and microread methodologies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Android mobile forensics tools and techniques for digital crime investigation, as well as their use in gathering and analyzing evidence. Forensic software tools like Cellebrite UFED, Oxygen Forensic Detective, XRY by MSAB, Magnet AXIOM, SPF Pro by SalvationDATA, MOBILedit Forensic Express, and EnCase Forensic employ both physical and logical techniques to retrieve data from mobile devices. These advanced tools offer a structured approach to tackling digital crimes effectively. We compare dependability, speed, compatibility, data recovery accuracy, and reporting. Mobile-network forensics ensures data acquisition, decryption, and analysis success. Conclusions show that Android mobile forensics tools for digital crime investigations are diverse and have different capabilities. Mobile forensics software offers complete solutions, but new data storage and encryption methods require constant development. The continuous evolution of forensic software tools and a comprehensive tool classification system could further enhance digital crime investigation capabilities.</p>

Abstract With space missions such as Kepler, TESS, and Gaia, we have a wealth of data on pulsating white dwarfs that can be leveraged in white dwarf asteroseismology. We address the question of the proportion of white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers versus those with thick hydrogen layers. We also provide a mass–radius relation for carbon–oxygen-core, hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs. Such a relationship can be used in conjunction with magnitudes and distance measurements to constrain the mass and effective temperature of the white dwarfs. We select nine hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs for their rich pulsation spectra. From such pulsation spectra, we can derive the asymptotic period spacing, which in turn allows us to determine the thickness of the hydrogen and helium envelope of the models, without having to perform period-by-period fitting. We find that the majority of the white dwarfs have thicker hydrogen layers and we determine an upper limit of M r = 1–10 −2.2 for the location of the base of the helium layer, in accordance with stellar evolution models. We confirm a finding from earlier studies that used a mass–radius relation and Gaia data to determine the effective temperatures of white dwarfs. The Gaia data systematically point to white dwarfs of lower effective temperature than indicated by the spectroscopy. Our results also support the hypothesis that white dwarfs with thicker hydrogen layers are more common than those with thinner layers.

We conducted an investigation on the chemical abundances of 4,316 stars in the red giant branch (RGB) phase from the recently released APO-K2 catalogue. Our aim was to characterize the abundance trends of the single elements with [$\alpha$/Fe], mainly focusing on C, N, and O, which are the most relevant for the estimation of stellar ages. The chemical analysis of the RGB sample involved cross-matching data from the APO-K2 catalogue with individual element abundances from APOGEE DR17. The analysis detected a statistically significant difference in the [(C+N+O)/Fe] - [$\alpha$/Fe] trend with respect to the simple $\alpha$-enhancement scenario. This difference remained robust across different choices for the reference solar mixture and potential zero-point calibrations of C and N abundances. The primary discrepancy was a steeper increase in [O/Fe] with [$\alpha$/Fe], reaching a 0.1 dex difference at [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3. Notably, the impact on the evolutionary timescale of such oxygen over-abundance with respect to the commonly adopted uniform $\alpha$-enhancement is rather limited. We verified that stellar models computed using an ad hoc O-rich mixture sped up the evolution by only 1% at [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3, due to the counterbalancing effects of O enrichment on both the evolutionary timescale and the Z-to-[Fe/H] relationship.

Directional ionic migration in ultra-thin metal-oxide semiconductors under applied electric fields is a key mechanism for developing various electronic nanodevices. However, understanding charge transfer dynamics is challenging due to rapid ionic migration and uncontrolled charge transfer, which can reduce the functionality of microelectronic devices. This research investigates the supercapacitive-coupled memristive characteristics of ultra-thin heterostructured metal-oxide semiconductor films at TiO2-In2O3/Au Schottky junctions. Using atomic layer deposition (ALD), we nano-engineered In2O3/Au-based metal/semiconductor heterointerfaces. TEM studies followed by XPS elemental analysis revealed the chemical and structural characteristics of the heterointerfaces. Subsequent AFM studies of the hybrid heterointerfaces demonstrated supercapacitor-like behavior in nanometer-thick TiO2-In2O3/Au junctions, resembling ultra-thin supercapacitors, pseudocapacitors, and nanobatteries. The highest specific capacitance of 2.6 × 104 F.g−1 was measured in the TiO2-In2O3/Au junctions with an amorphous In2O3 electron gate. Additionally, we examined the impact of crystallization, finding that thermal annealing led to the formation of crystalline In2O3 films with higher oxygen vacancy content at TiO2-In2O3 heterointerfaces. This crystallization process resulted in the evolution of non-zero I-V hysteresis loops into zero I-V hysteresis loops with supercapacitive-coupled memristive characteristics. This research provides a platform for understanding and designing adjustable ultra-thin Schottky junctions with versatile electronic properties.

Abstract We report platinum-group element (PGE) and Re concentrations, and Re−Os isotopic data for peridotites and podiform chromitite from the mid-Jurassic Coast Range ophiolite (CRO), California. Our aim is to provide insights into the formation and evolution of the CRO in a fore-arc tectonic setting. The CRO peridotites are divided into two groups: abyssal and supra-subduction zone (SSZ). They have Ir-group PGE concentrations similar to estimates for the primitive mantle and nearly chondritic relative abundances [(Os/Ir)N ≈ 1.1]. Abyssal-type peridotites have slightly subchondritic Pd-group PGE (PPGE)−Re abundances and flat chondrite-normalized patterns, whereas the SSZ-type ones are depleted overall with highly fractionated PPGE−Re patterns. The CRO peridotites have 187Os/188Os values of 0.1188 to 0.1315 (γOs = −8.3 to 1.4) and 187Re/188Os ranging from 0.022 to 0.413. The oxygen fugacity based on the V/Yb ratios of the CRO peridotites is equivalent to the fayalite−magnetite−quartz buffer. The abyssal-type peridotites are residues after ≤5% melting of the primitive upper mantle and represent a remnant of oceanic lithosphere trapped in an SSZ setting but before it was re-melted or modified by subduction processes. The abyssal-type peridotites yield an aluminachron model age of ~1.5 Ga, implying that the CRO mantle had experienced episode(s) of melt extraction before the CRO crust was formed. The SSZ-type peridotites are refractory residues after ~5% to 15% melting. Extraction of fore-arc basalts generated mainly by decompression melting resulted in the SSZ-type peridotites. The chromitite has 187Os/188Os value of 0.1250 (γOs = −3.5) and PGE−Re patterns complementary to that of boninite, indicating a genetic link to fore-arc magmatism.

Abstract We present determinations of the gas-phase and stellar metallicities of a sample of 65 star-forming galaxies at z ≃ 3.5 using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy from the VANDELS survey in combination with follow-up rest-frame optical spectroscopy from VLT/KMOS and Keck/MOSFIRE. We infer gas-phase oxygen abundances (Zg; tracing O/H) via strong optical nebular lines and stellar iron abundances (Z⋆; tracing Fe/H) from full spectral fitting to the FUV continuum. Our sample spans the stellar mass range 8.5 &lt; log(M⋆/M⊙) &lt; 10.5 and shows clear evidence for both a stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that our O and Fe abundance estimates both exhibit a similar mass-dependence, such that $\mathrm{Fe/H}\propto M_{\star }^{0.30\pm 0.11}$ and $\mathrm{O/H}\propto M_{\star }^{0.32\pm 0.09}$. At fixed M⋆ we find that, relative to their solar values, O abundances are systematically larger than Fe abundances (i.e. α-enhancement). We estimate an average enhancement of (O/Fe) = 2.65 ± 0.16 × (O/Fe)⊙ which appears to be independent of M⋆. We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place a constraint on the strength of galactic-level outflows via the mass-outflow factor (η). We show that outflow efficiencies that scale as $\eta \propto M_{\star }^{-0.32}$ can simultaneously explain the functional form of of the stellar and gas-phase MZR, as well as the degree of α-enhancement at fixed Fe/H. Our results add further evidence to support a picture in which α-enhanced abundance ratios are ubiquitous in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, as expected for young systems whose interstellar medium is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia, however there is limited understanding of its pathophysiology including the cellular and ultrastructural changes rendered by the irregular rhythm, which limits pharmacological therapy development. Prior work has demonstrated the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of AF. Mitochondrial structure, interactions with other organelles such as sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and T-tubules (TT), and degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy are important processes to understand ultrastructural changes due to AF. However, most analysis of mitochondrial structure and interactome in AF has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) modalities such as transmission electron microscopy (EM), which does not fully visualize the morphological evolution of the mitochondria during mitophagy. Herein, we utilize focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and perform reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) EM from murine left atrial samples and measure the interactions of mitochondria with SR and TT. We developed a novel 3D quantitative analysis of FIB-SEM in a murine model of AF to quantify mitophagy stage, mitophagosome size in cardiomyocytes, and mitochondrial structural remodeling when compared with control mice. We show that in our murine model of spontaneous and continuous AF due to persistent late sodium current, left atrial cardiomyocytes have heterogenous mitochondria, with a significant number which are enlarged with increased elongation and structural complexity. Mitophagosomes in AF cardiomyocytes are located at Z-lines where they neighbor large, elongated mitochondria. Mitochondria in AF cardiomyocytes show increased organelle interaction, with 5X greater contact area with SR and are 4X as likely to interact with TT when compared to control. We show that mitophagy in AF cardiomyocytes involves 2.5X larger mitophagosomes that carry increased organelle contents. In conclusion, when oxidative stress overcomes compensatory mechanisms, mitophagy in AF faces a challenge of degrading bulky complex mitochondria, which may result in increased SR and TT contacts, perhaps allowing for mitochondrial Ca
