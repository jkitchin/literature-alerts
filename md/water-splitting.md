Abstract Ruthenium dioxide (RuO₂) electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffer from mediocre activity and rather instability induced by high Ru-O covalency. Here, the tensile strained Sr0.1Ta0.1Ru0.8O2-x (TS-Sr0.1Ta0.1Ru0.8O2-x) nanocatalysts were synthesized via a molten salt-assisted quenching strategy. The TS spacially elongates the Ru-O bond and reduces covalency, thereby inhibiting the lattice oxygen participation and structural decomposition. The synergistic electronic modulations among Sr-Ru-Ta groups both optimize deprotonation on oxygen sites and intermediates absorption on Ru sites, lowering the OER energy barrier. Those result in a well-balanced activity-stability profile, confirmed by comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses. Our TS-Sr0.1Ta0.1Ru0.8O2-x electrode demonstrated an overpotential of 166 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and an order of magnitude higher S-number, indicating exceptional stability compared to bare Sr0.1Ta0.1Ru0.8O2-x. It exhibited degradation rates of 0.02 mV/h at 10 mA cm-2 over 1000 h and 0.25 mV/h at 200 mA cm-2 over 200 h. This study elucidates the effectiveness of tensile strain and strategic doping in enhancing the activity and stability of Ru-based catalysts for acidic OER.

Abstract Anionic redox allows the direct formation of O─O bonds from lattice oxygens and provides higher catalytic in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than does the conventional metal ion mechanism. While previous theories have predicted and experiments have suggested the possible O─O bond, it has not yet been directly observed in the OER process. In this study, operando soft X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) at the O K‐edge and the operando Raman spectra is performed on layered double CoFe hydroxides (LDHs) after intercalation with [Cr(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3− , and revealed a three‐step oxidation process, staring from Co 2+ to Co 3+ , further to Co 4+ (3d6L), and ultimately leading to the formation of O─O bonds and O 2 evolution above a threshold voltage (1.4 V). In contrast, a gradual oxidation of Fe is observed in CoFe LDHs. The OER activity exhibits a significant enhancement, with the overpotential decreasing from 300 to 248 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , following the intercalation of [Cr(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3− into CoFe LDHs, underscoring a crucial role of anionic redox in facilitating water splitting.

Understanding the influence of surface structural features at a molecular level is beneficial in guiding an electrode's mechanistic proposals for electrocatalytic reactions. The relationship between structural stability and catalytic activity significantly impacts reaction performance, even though atomistic knowledge of active sites remains a topic of discussion. In this context, this work presents scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results for the highly ordered arrangement of manganese porphyrin molecules on a Au(111) surface; STM allows us to monitor active sites at a molecular level to focus on long-standing issues with the electrocatalytic process, especially the exact nature of the real active sites at the interfaces. After water oxidation, manganese porphyrin rapidly decomposes into active catalytic species as bright protrusions. These newly formed active species drastically lost catalytic activity, up to 82%, through only acid treatment, one of the oxide removal methods, not by deionized water and acetone treatments. STM results of the obviated active species on the Au surface by an acidic solution support the forfeited catalytic activity. In addition, it shows a 67% decrement in catalytic activity by adsorption of phosphonic acid, one of the oxide's preferred adsorption materials, compared to the pristine one. Based on these observations, we confirm that the newly formed active species, as water oxidation catalysts, mostly consist of manganese oxides. Notable findings of our work provide molecular evidence for the active sites of Au and modified Au electrodes that spur the future development of water oxidation catalysts.

Transition metal oxides, particularly NiFe(OH)2, are recognized for their high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and structural stability. However, their performance in natural seawater electrolysis remains insufficiently studied. Manganese dioxide (MnO2), which is known for its multiple crystal phases and high OER selectivity, can be incorporated to enhance the catalytic properties. In this study, the OER catalytic performance of carbon cloth-supported manganese dioxide-modified nickel–iron bimetallic hydroxide (MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC) electrodes was explored in both alkaline and natural seawater. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode achieved overpotentials of 284 mV and 363 mV at current densities of 10 mA·cm−2 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively, with a Tafel slope of 68.6 mV·dec−1 in alkaline seawater. Most importantly, the prepared MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode maintained stable OER performance over 120 h of testing. In natural seawater, the MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode outperformed the NiFe-LDH/CC electrode by exhibiting an oxygen evolution selectivity of 61.1%. This study highlights the potential of MnO2-modified nickel–iron-based materials for efficient and stable OER in seawater electrolysis, which offers a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production in coastal desert regions.

Searching for high energy-density electrode materials for sodium ion batteries has revealed Na-deficient intercalation compounds with lattice oxygen redox as promising high-capacity cathodes. However, anionic redox reactions commonly encountered poor electrochemical reversibility and unfavorable structural transformations during dynamic (de)sodiation processes. To address this issue, we employed lithium orbital hybridization chemistry to create Na-O-Li configuration in a prototype P2-layered Na

A comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes at the catalyst/electrolyte interfaces is crucial for the development of advanced electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the chemical processes related to surface corrosion and catalyst degradation have not been well understood so far. In this study, we employ LiCoO 2 as a model catalyst and observe distinct OER activities and surface stabilities in different alkaline solutions. Operando X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and online mass spectroscopy (OMS) measurements prove the selective intercalation of alkali cations into the layered structure of LiCoO 2 during OER. It is proposed that the dynamic cation intercalations facilitate the chemical oxidation process between highly oxidative Co species and adsorbed water molecules, triggering the so‐called electrochemical‐chemical reaction mechanism (EC‐mechanism). The results of this study emphasize the influence of cations on OER and provide insights into new strategies for achieving both high activity and stability in high‐performance OER catalysts.

Abstract Oxygen redox in layered oxide cathodes for Na‐ion batteries is considered a promising approach for improving the energy density. However, oxygen‐redox‐based cathodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and undesirable structural change during charge/discharge, leading to poor electrochemical performances. Herein, introducing vacancies (□) in the transition metal layers enables the enhanced oxygen redox‐based electrochemical performances in the P3‐type Mn‐based layered oxide cathode is demonstrated. The vacancies can play a role of the local distortion buffers, resulting in the enhanced oxygen redox kinetics and the suppressed structural deformation such as P3‐O3(II) phase transition. The oxygen‐redox‐based P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 exhibits the large discharge capacity of ≈140.95 mAh g −1 at 26 mA g −1 with a high average discharge voltage of ≈3.54 V (vs Na + /Na). Even at 650 mA g −1 , its discharge capacity and average operation voltages delivered ≈122.06 mAh g −1 and ≈3.22 V, respectively. Especially, the small gap of average discharge voltage indicates both improves power‐capability and enhanced kinetics of oxygen redox in P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 . Moreover, the vacancy buffer in the transition metal layers results in the stable cycle‐performance of P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 with the capacity retention of ≈80.80% for 100 cycles, due to the suppressed P3‐O3(II) phase transition.

Abstract Surface reconstruction plays a pivotal role in enhancing the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in terms of the structural transformation from metal oxides to (oxy)hydroxides. Herein, a novel (oxy)hydroxide (FeCoNiCuMoOOH) with high entropy is developed by the electrochemical reconstitution of corresponding oxide (FeCoNiCuMoO x ). Significantly, the FeCoNiCuMoOOH exhibits much higher OER electrocatalytic activity and durability with an overpotential as low as 201 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and with a Tafel slope of 39.4 mV dec −1 . The FeCoNiCuMoOOH/NF presents high stability when testing under a constant current at 100 mA cm −2 within 1000 h. The surface reconstruction is a process of dissolution‐reprecipitation of Cu and Mo species and co‐hydroxylation of five metal species, which ultimately leads to the formation of FeCoNiCuMoOOH from FeCoNiCuMoOx. This study holds great significance in the realm of designing high‐entropy (oxy)hydroxides catalysts with exceptional activity and stability for OER.

Abstract Multinuclear metal clusters are ideal candidates to catalyze small molecule activation reactions involving the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, on constructing an unparalleled Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster within porphyrin‐based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and the electrocatalytic features of such Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is reported. The reaction of Co II sulfate and metal complexes of tetrakis(4‐pyridyl)porphyrin under solvothermal conditions afforded Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs (M═Co, Cu, and Zn). Crystallographic studies revealed that these Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs have the same framework structure, having the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters connected by metalloporphyrin units through Co─N pyridyl bonds. In the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster, the four Co II ions are chemically and symmetrically equivalent and are each coordinated with four sulfate O atoms to give a distorted cube‐like structure. Electrocatalytic studies showed that these Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs are all active for electrocatalytic OER and ORR. Importantly, by regulating the activity of the metalloporphyrin units, it is confirmed that the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster is active for oxygen electrocatalysis. With the use of Co porphyrins as connecting units, Co 4 ‐Co‐MOF displays the highest electrocatalytic activity in this series of MOFs by showing a 10 mA cm −2 OER current density at 357 mV overpotential and an ORR half‐wave potential at 0.83 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of two proximal Co atoms in the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster in OER by facilitating the formation of O─O bonds. This work is of fundamental significance to present the construction of Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters in framework structures for oxygen electrocatalysis and to demonstrate the cooperation between two proximal Co atoms in such clusters during the O─O bond formation process.

Abstract The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) from O 2 or H 2 O via the two‐electron (2e − ) oxygen reduction (2e − ORR) or water oxidation (2e − WOR) reaction provides a green and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, a paired‐electrosynthesis tactic is reported for concerted H 2 O 2 production at a high rate by coupling the 2e − ORR and 2e − WOR, in which the bifunctional oxygen‐vacancy‐enriched Bi 2 O 3 nanorods (O v ‐Bi 2 O 3 ‐EO), obtained through electrochemically oxidative reconstruction of Bi‐based metal–organic framework (Bi‐MOF) nanorod precursor, are used as both efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, achieving concurrent H 2 O 2 production at both electrodes with high Faradaic efficiencies. Specifically, the coupled 2e − ORR//2e − WOR electrolysis system based on such distinctive oxygen‐defect Bi catalyst displays excellent performance for the paired‐electrosynthesis of H 2 O 2 , delivering a remarkable cell Faradaic efficiency of 154.8% and an ultrahigh H 2 O 2 production rate of 4.3 mmol h −1 cm −2 . Experiments combined with theoretical analysis reveal the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in optimizing the adsorption of intermediates associated with the selective two‐electron reaction pathways, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of the 2e − reaction processes at both electrodes. This work establishes a new paradigm for developing advanced electrocatalysts and designing novel paired‐electrolysis systems for scalable and sustainable H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis.

Abstract The synthesis of nitrate by the electrochemical N 2 oxidation reaction (NOR) is currently one of the most promising routes. However, the traditional generation of nitrate depends on the oxidation reaction between N 2 and H 2 O (or ·OH), which involves complex reaction steps and intermediates, showing strong competition from oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, an effective NOR method is proposed to directly oxidize N 2 by using O 3 as a reactive oxygen source to reduce the reaction step. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the nitrate yield of Pd‐Mn 3 O 4 /CNT electrocatalyst reaches the milligram level, which is the highest yield reported so far for electrocatalytic NOR. Quantitative characterization is employed to establish a comprehensive set of benchmarks to confirm the intrinsic nature of nitrogen activation and test the O 3 ‐mediated reaction mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the heterostructure Pd‐Mn 3 O 4 leads to a strong adsorption preference for N 2 and O 3 , which greatly reduces the activation energy barrier for N 2 . This accelerates the synthesis of nitrate based on the direct formation mechanism, which reduces energy barriers and the reaction steps, thus increasing the performance of electrocatalytic nitrate production. The techno‐economic analysis underscores the promising feasibility and sustainable economic value of the presented method.

The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/non‐magnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core‐shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores’ local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells’ surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen‐containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128% at 1.63 V and an overpotential reduction by 28 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100 h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.

Abstract Electrochemical splitting of water for hydrogen generation has emerged as a potential strategy for transitioning towards renewable energy sources and mitigating the environmental impact of fossil fuel dependence. However, the efficiency of water splitting is mainly hindered by oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side, which involves kinetically sluggish four proton‐coupled electron‐transfer steps. Recent studies on OER demonstrate that a spin‐dependent mechanism governs the reaction kinetics, wherein the electronic exchange interactions in the catalytic activity of transition metals can provide a spin‐selective channel to filter out electron spins with the right orientation during the formation of O 2 . Maximizing efficiency and stability of such catalysts require optimization the geometric and electrical structures of transition metal systems. In addition, it is vital to understand the OER mechanism with spin considerations to be familiar with the connection between spin, charge, orbital, and lattice characteristics. This review focuses on current developments in understanding and the use of the spin‐related effect in the OER mechanism.

## Unveiling the Synergistic Effect of Two-Dimensional Heterostructure NiFeP@FeOOH as Stable Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction

Introducing multiple active sites and constructing a heterostructure are efficient strategies to develop high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, two-dimensional heterostructure NiFeP@FeOOH nanosheets supported by nickel foam (NF) are prepared by a hydrothermal–phosphorization–electrodeposition process. The synthesis of self-supporting heterostructure NiFeP@FeOOH nanosheets on NF increases the specific surface region, while bimetallic phosphide realizes rapid charge transfer, improving the electron transfer rate. The introduction of FeOOH and the construction of a heterostructure result in a synergistic effect among the components, and the surface-active sites are abundant. In situ Raman spectroscopy showed that the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance was due to reconstruction-induced hydroxyl oxide, which achieved a multi-active site reaction. The NiFeP@FeOOH/NF electrocatalytic activity was then significantly improved. The findings indicate that in a 1.0 M KOH alkaline solution, NiFeP@FeOOH/NF showed an OER overpotential of 235 mV at 100 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 46.46 mV dec−1, and it worked stably at 50 mA cm−2 for 80 h. This research proves that constructing heterostructure and introducing FeOOH are of great significance to the study of the properties of OER electrocatalysts.

NiCo2O4 has been proven to show high electrocatalytic activity, however facile and inexpensive techniques for preparation of this compound as mesostructured thin film is lacking. In this study, the sol‐gel synthesis of nanocrystalline mesoporous spinel NiCo2O4 thin films by dip‐coating and soft‐templating using the evaporation‐induced self‐assembly approach is reported. The morphology and crystallographic structure were thoroughly probed by various physicochemical characterization techniques collectively validating the development of uniform mesoporous NiCo2O4 architectures crystallizing exclusively in the cubic spinel phase after calcination in air. The surface area of the thin films depended on the calcination temperature. XPS investigations showed that the amount of Ni3+ and defective oxygen species increased for decreasing calcination temperatures. The overall electrochemical surface area, Ni3+ content, charge transfer resistance, and amount of defective oxygen sites were found to collectively control the oxygen evolution reaction performance. After an optimized annealing procedure at 300°C and chronopotentiometric analysis at 10 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h, a low overpotential of 330 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline solution was achieved. The results highlight the necessity of precise selection of the appropriate calcination temperature and electrochemical pre‐treatment conditions for adjusting the concentration of electrocatalytically active reaction sites of sol‐gel‐derived NiCo2O4 thin films.

## Evolution of Oxygen Content of Graphene Oxide for Humidity Sensing

Graphene oxide (GO) has shown significant potential in humidity sensing. It is well accepted that the oxygen-containing functional groups in GO significantly influence its humidity sensing performance. However, the relationship between the content of these groups and the humidity sensing capability of GO-based sensors remains unclear. In the present work, we investigate the role of oxygen-containing functional groups in the humidity sensing performance by oxidizing graphite with mesh numbers 80–120, 325, and 8000 using the Hummers method, resulting in GO-80, GO-325, and GO-8000. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to identify the types and quantification of oxygen-containing functional groups. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to simulate the adsorption energy, intercalation dynamics, and hydrogen bonding of water molecules. Electrochemical tests were used to compare the adsorption/desorption time and response sensitivity of graphene oxide to humidity. It is proposed that hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are the main contributing groups to humidity sensing. GO-8000 shows a relatively fast response time, but the large number of carboxyl groups will hinder intercalation of water molecules, thus exhibiting lower sensitivity. This research provides a reference for the future development of graphene-based sensors, catalysts, and environmental materials.

Abstract N-doped carbon materials, with their applications as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), have been extensively studied. However, a negletcted fact is that the operating potential of the ORR is higher than the theoretical oxidation potential of carbon, possibly leading to the oxidation of carbon materials. Consequently, the influence of the structural oxidation evolution on ORR performance and the real active sites are not clear. In this study, we discover a two-step oxidation process of N-doped carbon during the ORR. The first oxidation process is caused by the applied potential and bubbling oxygen during the ORR, leading to the oxidative dissolution of N and the formation of abundant oxygen-containing functional groups. This oxidation process also converts the reaction path from the four-electron (4e) ORR to the two-electron (2e) ORR. Subsequently, the enhanced 2e ORR generates oxidative H 2 O 2 , which initiates the second stage of oxidation to some newly formed oxygen-containing functional groups, such as quinones to dicarboxyls, further diversifying the oxygen-containing functional groups and making carboxyl groups as the dominant species. We also reveal the synergistic effect of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups by providing additional opportunities to access active sites with optimized adsorption of OOH*, thus leading to high efficiency and durability in electrocatalytic H 2 O 2 production.

Microstructural evolution of inner oxide layer of a Si-modified austenitic stainless steel exposed to oxygen-saturated static lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) at 550 °C up to 3000 h has been investigated. A dual-phase separated structure consisting of Fe-Cr spinel and (Fe, Cr)1-xNix phase is formed in inner oxide layer, attributed to partitioning of Ni and Cr associated with Fe-Cr spinel formation. SiO2 is preferentially formed preceding the Fe-Cr spinel at internal oxidation frontier, leading to dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles within Fe-Cr spinel. The mechanism of LBE penetration into inner oxide layer is further developed based on preferable dissolution process of (Fe, Cr)1-xNix phase.

The slow oxygen evolution kinetics of iron oxide nanorod arrays have limited their applications in photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we introduce p-type semiconductor cuprous oxide and further cover cobalt hydroxide ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of both by electrochemical deposition; these methods obviously enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance of iron oxide nanorods on titanium sheet substrate. The photocurrent of this heterostructure reached 4.8 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution under AM 1.5G illumination, which is much higher than the currently reported photocatalytic water splitting performance of iron oxide nanoarrays. The construction of Fe2O3/Cu2S p-n heterojunction accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers in the main body of Fe2O3 nanorod arrays; as an excellent oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC), the introduction of Co(OH)x accelerates the kinetic process of interfacial water oxidation leading to the rapid depletion of photogenerated holes, which further improves the charge separation on the photoanode surface. Thus, the synergistic effect between Fe2O3/Cu2S p-n heterojunctions and oxygen evolution catalysts enhanced the iron oxide nanorod array photoanodes.

Oxygen evolution reaction is the essential anodic reaction for water splitting. Designing tunable electronic structures to overcome its slow kinetics is an effective strategy. Herein, the molecular ammonium iron sulfate dodecahydrate is employed as the precursor to synthesize the C, N, S triatomic co-doped Fe(Al)OOH on Ni foam (C,N,S-Fe(Al)OOH-NF) with asymmetric electronic structure. Both in situ oxygen vacancies and their special electronic configuration enable the electron transfer between the d-p orbitals and get the increase of OER activity. Density functional theory calculation further indicates the effect of electronic structure on catalytic activity and stability at the oxygen vacancies. In alkaline solution, the catalyst C,N,S-Fe(Al)OOH-NF shows good catalytic activity and stability for water splitting. For OER, the overpotential of 10 mA cm

Abstract Crystalline perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, particularly for anodic oxygen evolution reactions, owing to their low cost and high intrinsic activity. Perovskite oxides with noncrystalline or amorphous characteristics also exhibit promising electrocatalytic performance toward electrochemical water splitting. In this review, a fundamental understanding of the characteristics and advantages of crystalline, noncrystalline, and amorphous perovskite oxides is presented. Subsequently, recent progress in the development of advanced electrocatalysts for water electrolysis by engineering and breaking the crystallinity of perovskite oxides is reviewed, with a special focus on the underlying structure–activity relationships. Finally, the remaining challenges and unsolved issues are presented, and an outlook is briefly proposed for the future exploration of next‐generation water‐splitting electrocatalysts based on perovskite oxides.

Abstract Tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on intratumoral free radicals, while the limited oxygen source and the depletion of tissue oxygen may exacerbate the hypoxia. As the treatment progresses, there will eventually be a problem of insufficient free radicals. Here, it is found that Au@CeO 2 nano‐rods (Au@Ce NRs), assembled by gold nano‐rods (Au NRs) and ceria nanoparticles (CeO 2 NPs), can efficaciously absorb near‐infrared light (NIR) to promote the release of oxygen and free radicals. Au@Ce NRs exhibit a higher proportion of Ce 3+ (Ce 2 O 3 ) after oxygen release, while Ce 3+ is subsequently oxidized to Ce 4+ (CeO 2 ) by trace H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, Au@Ce NRs re‐oxidized by trace H 2 O 2 can re‐releasing oxygen and free radicals again upon NIR treatment, achieving oxygenation/oxygen evolution, similar to charging/discharging. This loop maximizes the conversion of limited oxygen source into highly cytotoxic free radicals. As a result, when B16‐F10 cells are treated by NIR/Au@Ce NRs, more tumor cells undergo apoptosis, consistent with the higher level of free radicals. Importantly, NIR/Au@Ce NRs successfully suppresses tumor growth and promotes the generation of epidermal collagen fibers in the transplanted tumor model. Therefore, the rod‐shaped Au@Ce NRs provide an ideal platform for maximizing the utilization of intratumoral oxygen sources and improving the treatment of melanoma.

Abstract In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to produce high-value products. Most studies have focused solely on the photocatalytic properties of the electrodes, overlooking their electrocatalytic properties and the different products obtained under dark conditions. Our work aims to address this gap by comparing the electrocatalytic activity under dark and light conditions to determine whether light influences the reactivity of the electrodes or if it just reduces the overpotential of the reaction. To achieve this, we employed two model semiconductors, TiO2 and BiVO4. We have analyzed their polarization curves under both dark and light conditions and evaluated the competence of glycerol oxidation reaction with the oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, we conducted long-term (photo)electrolysis revealing the beneficial role of light on the electrolytic process, as it enables the obtention of C3 products on illuminated TiO2 photoanodes at low electrode polarization, comparable to the performance of BiVO4.

This study first demonstrates the potential of organic photoabsorbing blends in overcoming a critical limitation of metal oxide photoanodes in tandem modules: insufficient photogenerated current. Various organic blends, including PTB7‐Th:FOIC, PTB7‐Th:O6T‐4F, PM6:Y6, and PM6:FM, were systematically tested. When coupled with electron transport layer (ETL) contacts, these blends exhibit exceptional charge separation and extraction, with PM6:Y6 achieving saturation photocurrents up to 16.8 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V RHE (oxygen evolution thermodynamic potential). For the first time, a tandem structure utilizing organic photoanodes has been computationally designed and fabricated and the implementation of a double PM6:Y6 photoanode/photovoltaic structure resulted in photogenerated currents exceeding 7 mA cm −2 at 0 V RHE (hydrogen evolution thermodynamic potential) and anodic current onset potentials as low as −0.5 V RHE . The herein‐presented organic‐based approach paves the way for further exploration of different blend combinations to target specific oxidative reactions by selecting precise donor/acceptor candidates among the multiple existing ones.

Electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation (EAO) is an attractive alternative to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical hydrogen evolution cells. However, the development of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts is a major challenge. Herein, we developed a nitrogen-doped bimetallic oxide electrocatalyst (WO-N/NF) by a one-step hydrothermal method for the selective electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid in alkaline electrolytes. The WO-N/NF electrode features block-shaped particles on a rough, inhomogeneous surface with cracks and lumpy nodules, increasing active sites and enhancing electrolyte diffusion. The electrode demonstrates exceptional activity, stability, and selectivity, achieving efficient benzoic acid production while reducing the electrolysis voltage. A low onset potential of 1.38 V (vs. RHE) is achieved to reach a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with only 0.2 mmol of metal precursors, which is 396 mV lower than that of water oxidation. The analysis reveals a yield, conversion, and selectivity of 98.41%, 99.66%, and 99.74%, respectively, with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.77%. This work provides insight into the rational design of a highly active and selective catalyst for electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR), requiring less energy to produce hydrogen, is considered as a potential alternative to the traditional oxygen evolution reaction. Consequently, developing highly efficient UOR catalysts to facilitate H2 production has garnered widespread attention. A promising approach to enhancing the effectiveness of these electrocatalysts is defect engineering. By introducing structural defects, defect engineering can expose more active sites and optimize their electronic structure, thereby improving their activity. This work offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress in defect engineering of nickel-based electrocatalysts for the UOR. It summarizes various strategies for generating defects, including the creation of vacancies, doping, the incorporation of single atoms, amorphization, and achieving high refractivity. Furthermore, we discuss the advanced characterization techniques commonly used to identify the presence of defects in these electrocatalysts, as well as to determine their detailed structures. Finally, we outline the prospects and challenges associated with the systematic design and fabrication of novel UOR electrocatalysts with tunable defects, aiming to further enhance their efficiency and stability.

Abstract Li–O 2 batteries (LOBs) have sparked significant interest due to their fascinating high theoretical energy density. However, the large overpotential for the formation and oxidation of Li 2 O 2 during charge and discharge process seriously hinders the further development and application of LOBs. In this work, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with different metal clusters (Fe, Ti, Zr) are successfully synthesized, and they are employed as the photoelectrodes for the photo‐assisted LOBs. The special dual excitation pathways of Fe‐MOF under illumination and the superior separation efficiency of photocarriers, which significantly enhance the activation of O 2 /Li 2 O 2 , improving the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, compared to traditional inorganic semiconductor crystals, Fe‐MOF exhibits large specific surface area and excellent O 2 adsorption ability. Therefore, the LOB with Fe‐MOF as the cathode exhibits large specific capacity, ultralow charge/discharge overpotential of 0.22 V at 0.05 mA cm −2 and excellent stability of 195 cycles under illumination. This study provides an environmentally friendly and highly efficient photocatalyst for LOBs, and a new strategy for designing photoelectrodes.

The electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction can reduce overpotential and can be connected in series with nonelectrochemical processes to achieve the preparation of more high-value compounds. Herein, Cu- and Co-incorporated nickel hydroxide (CuCo–Ni(OH)2) was synthesized and applied to the anodic benzylamine oxidation reaction, which is 280 mV lower than the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction to reach the current density of 50 mA cm–2. When the electrocatalytic oxidation of benzylamine and hydrogen evolution reaction are coupled to form an electrolytic cell, the potential to reach 10 mA cm–2 is reduced by 197 mV compared to the overall water splitting. The benzylamine is converted to benzamide with 99.3% conversion and 90.2% faraday efficiency under 1.45 V constant voltage electrolysis, and the catalytic performance remains at a high level after 4 cycles. The characterization and density functional theory calculations show that Cu and Co share the transfer charge from Ni, making it easy for CuCo–Ni(OH)2 to deprotonate Ni–O* sites. The formed Ni–O* sites exhibit lower energy barriers in the proton transfer of benzylamine to benzonitrile and hydration intermediates, resulting in a better catalytic performance of CuCo–Ni(OH)2 than Ni(OH)2 in the electrocatalytic oxidation of benzylamine to benzamide.

To elucidate the properties of cyanobacterial metabolism and growth, computational reconstructions of genome-scale metabolic networks play an increasingly important role. Here, we present an updated reconstruction of the metabolic network of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and its quantitative evaluation using flux balance analysis (FBA). To overcome limitations of conventional FBA, and to allow for the integration of experimental analyses, we develop a novel approach to describe light absorption and light utilization within the framework of FBA. Our approach incorporates photoinhibition and a variable quantum yield into the constraint-based description of light-limited phototrophic growth. We show that the resulting model is capable of predicting quantitative properties of cyanobacterial growth, including photosynthetic oxygen evolution and the ATP/NADPH ratio required for growth and cellular maintenance. Our approach retains the computational and conceptual simplicity of FBA and is readily applicable to other phototrophic microorganisms.

Abstract High entropy perovskite oxide (HEPO) materials have received significant interest as efficient electrocatalysts owing to their chemical and structural stability, effective interaction of multiple metal active sites with the reaction intermediate species resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. The effect of high‐entropy strategy could achieve the regulation of the structural durability by tailoring the composition. Herein, we design a novel transition metal and rare‐earth metal based high entropy perovskite oxide (Co 0.11 Mn 0.11 Ni 0.11 Fe 0.14 La 0.13 Nd 0.13 Gd 0.13 Pr 0.13 )O 3, showing superior catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and also promising electrocatalyst in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High degree of cationic dispersion in the lattice and multiple electrocatalytic active sites enhance the oxygen ion migration at the surface and facilitate electron transfer, manifesting good ORR performance. Notably, the as‐prepared high entropy material exhibits onset and half‐wave potential of 1.02 V and 0.89 V versus RHE, respectively, exceeding the performance of the benchmarked Pt/C catalyst in the ORR process with reasonable redox kinetics. Moreover, the material also presents faster kinetics with reasonably low overpotential and excellent electrochemical stability in the OER process as well. This study shows the viability of designing non‐precious high entropy materials as highly efficient oxide electrocatalyst by utilizing its broad compositional space.

Abstract Aiming to efficiently expedite alkaline overall water splitting (OWS) by addressing challenges such as sluggish kinetics and limited stability, a hollow Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 ‐NiS@Ni(OH) 2 nanorod array with surface nanosheets is devised, featuring a high‐index Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 (101)‐NiS(211) heterostructural interface and an upshifted d ‐band center. This nanoarchitecture intensifies the adsorption and interaction of H 2 O and OH − reactants on the electrocatalyst surface, suitably bonds the * H intermediate in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and accelerates electron movement of * H, minimizes the energy requirement of the rate‐limiting phase ( * OH → * O) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by facilitating O─H cleavage of * OH and optimally adsorbs * O, amplifies the exposure of surface‐active centers, and ultimately reduces the apparent activation energy. Consequently, the overpotentials are as low as 66.4 mV (HER) and 254.9 mV (OER) at 10 mA cm −2 , alongside high turnover frequencies of 142 s −1 (H 2 ) and 279 s −1 (O 2 ) at 100 and 300 mV, respectively, markedly outperforming direct‐electrodeposited analogues. When functioning as a bifunctional electrode in OWS, this material merely requires 1.57 V at 10 mA cm −2 and sustains an operation for 168 h, approaching Pt/C||RuO 2 benchmark.

Abstract Rapid cost reduction of green hydrogen is essential for the large‐scale deployment of hydrogen‐based energy system. A major component in achieving this is the development of advanced water electrolyzers. Sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck for water electrolysis, and tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop electrocatalysts that accelerate the OER kinetics. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of precious metal‐free OER electrocatalyst capable of stable operation at current densities above 1 A cm 2 . This brings an opportunity of constructing new‐generation electrolyzer with lower cost and higher productivity. However, achieving such high operating current densities presents new challenges. This review summarize the recent progress of high‐performance OER catalysts, and identifies key factors that can be leveraged to enhance catalyst activity. These factors include interface/surface engineering, amorphous and crystal phase coupling, hierarchical structure design, structural reconstruction and phase conversion, high entropy catalyst, and defect engineering. Additionally, the pressing challenges that have been largely ignored in previous research is addressed, such as sustaining long‐term stability under crucial conditions, disadvantages of immobilized powder electrocatalysts, electrode scale design, the necessity of designing innovative electrolyzer cell designs and advance characterization techniques.

Abstract The inverse problem of reconstructing two space-varying coefficients in a system of one-dimensional (1-d) time-dependent advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equations is considered. The ADR system can be used as a water quality model which describes the evolution of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in a river or stream. The coefficients to be reconstructed represents the effect of the deoxygenation and superficial reaeration processes on the DO and BOD concentration in water. Hölder stability estimates for the coefficients of interest are established using the Carleman estimate technique.

A thermal dynamic disaster in the goaf is one of the most serious coal mine disasters formed by coal spontaneous combustion and gas interweaving. However, the influence of the high-temperature hidden fire source formed in the goaf on the evolution law of thermal dynamic disasters is not clear, and effective prevention and control measures cannot be taken. Therefore, this paper uses the experimental platform of thermal dynamic disaster in the goaf to study the influence of different fire point positions on the development of thermal dynamic disaster in the goaf through a similar simulation experiment of thermal dynamic disaster evolution in the goaf and analyzes the corresponding relationship between temperature and CO concentration in the upper corner. The results show that under different locations of heat source, the high-temperature heat source of coal spontaneous combustion migrates to the air leakage side with sufficient oxygen supply, and an oxygen-poor circle is formed near the ignition point. Under the action of air leakage flow, CH4 accumulates in the deep part of the goaf on the return air side. Due to the increase in coal, part of CH4 is produced, which leads to the increase in concentration of CH4 at the ignition point. Under the action of different heat sources, the changing trend of concentration of CO and temperature in the return air corner is the same, but the temperature change in the return air corner shows a lag compared with the change in the concentration of CO, so concentration monitoring of CO can reflect the evolution process of the fire field in the goaf more quickly than temperature monitoring.

Abstract Catalyzing vanadium redox reactions in VRFBs with transition metal oxides is an effective and affordable approach. In this study, the surface electron distribution of TiO 2 was regulated by introducing oxygen vacancies into its lattice, enabling the electrode to exhibit outstanding catalytic efficacy in VO 2 + /VO 2+ and V 3+ /V 2+ redox transformations and suppress the detrimental side reaction (HER and OER) simultaneously. Benefiting from the enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, the 1000-TiO 2 -GF electrode sustained a stable operation for 100 cycles at 120 mA cm −2 with no discernible efficiency degradation. The DFT results indicate that oxygen vacancy in TiO 2 provides more extra electrons to its neighboring titanium, further strengthening the interaction between the electron-rich titanium and oxygen in VO 2 + /VO 2+ , thus enhancing its catalytic performance. The enhanced catalytic activity for V 3+ /V 2+ on oxygen vacancy-rich TiO 2 coating can be attributed to the effective suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction, which can occupy active sites exclusively and produce detrimental H 2 bubbles. This insight provides valuable guidance for the innovative design of catalysts in vanadium redox flow batteries.

Abstract Lewisite is a representative chemical warfare agent that contains arsenic. Thermal decomposition is an essential method for Lewisite destruction, and appropriate destruction conditions can enhance the environmental friendliness of this method by minimizing the hazards of destruction products. In this study, the variation of Lewisite during pyrolysis and incineration was calculated, with particular emphasis on the evolution behaviors of arsenic and chloride with temperature, pressure, and molar ratio. The main products identified during pyrolysis were HCl(g), C, As, and AsCl 3 (g). Under anoxic conditions, AsCl 3 (g) and As were the dominant species. In oxygen‐enriched conditions, arsenic existed primarily as AsCl 3 (g), As 2 O 5 , As 2 O 4 , and AsOCl. Below 600 °C, arsenic predominantly existed in high valence forms such as As 2 O 5 . Above 600 °C, the binding capacity of chlorine and arsenic was stronger than that of oxygen, resulting in an AsCl 3 (g) molar fraction exceeding 75 % at 1200 °C. The primary chlorides in oxygen‐enriched conditions were Cl 2 (g), HCl(g), AsCl 3 (g), and Cl(g). Lower incineration temperatures (around 500 °C), sufficient oxygen conditions (molar ratio above 4 : 1), and positive pressures were conducive to reducing the toxicity of destruction products. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data.

Abstract. The Devonian is a warmer-than-present geological period spanning from 419 to 359 million years ago (Ma) characterized by multiple identified ocean anoxic/hypoxic events. Despite decades of extensive investigation, no consensus has been reached regarding the drivers of these anoxic events. While growing geological evidence has demonstrated a temporal correlation between astronomical forcing and anoxia during this period, underlying physical mechanisms remain unknown, hence questioning causality. Here, we perform multiple sensitivity experiments, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (cGENIE), to isolate the influences of specific Devonian climate and palaeogeography components on ocean oxygen levels, contributing to the better understanding of the intricate interplay of factors preconditioning the ocean to anoxia. We quantify the impact of continental configuration, ocean-atmosphere biogeochemistry (global mean oceanic PO4 concentration and atmospheric pO2), climatic forcing (pCO2) and astronomical forcing on background oceanic circulation and oxygenation during the Devonian. Our results indicate that continental configuration is crucial for Devonian ocean anoxia, significantly influencing ocean circulation and oxygen levels while consistently modulating the effects of other Devonian climate components such as oceanic PO4 concentration, atmospheric pO2 and pCO2, and orbital forcing. The evolution of continental configuration provides a plausible explanation for the increased frequency of ocean anoxic events identified during the Middle and Late Devonian periods, as it contributed to the expansion of oxygen-depleted zones. Our simulations also show that both the decreased atmospheric pO2 and increased oceanic PO2 concentration exacerbate ocean anoxia, consistent with established knowledge. The variation of pCO2 reveals a wide range of ocean dynamics patterns, including stable oscillations, multiple convection cells, multistability and hysteresis; all leading to significant variations of the ocean oxygen levels, therefore strongly impacting the preconditioning of the ocean to anoxia. Furthermore, multistability and important hysteresis (particularly slow ocean time response) offer different mechanisms to account for the prolonged duration of some ocean anoxic events. Finally, we found that astronomical forcing substantially impacts ocean anoxia by altering ocean circulation and oxygen solubility, with obliquity consistently emerging as the primary orbital parameter driving ocean oxygen variations.

For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory of photocatalysis or the screening charge effect of electrochemical catalysis. Due to the formation of different intermediate active‐species during two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro‐ and photo‐catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro‐, photo‐, and piezo‐catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB‐OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in‐situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo‐catalysis over BOB‐OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo‐catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo‐catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo‐catalysis rather than electro‐catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo‐catalysis.

Abstract Li-rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathodes have been regarded as promising candidates for next-generation Li-ion batteries due to their exceptionally high energy density, which combines cationic and anionic redox activities. However, continuous voltage decay during cycling remains the primary obstacle for practical applications, which has yet to be fundamentally addressed. It is widely acknowledged that voltage decay originates from the irreversible migration of transition metal ions, which usually further exacerbates structural evolution and aggravates the irreversible oxygen redox reactions. Recently, constructing O2-type structure has been considered one of the most promising approaches for inhibiting voltage decay. In this review, the relationship between voltage decay and structural evolution is systematically elucidated. Strategies to suppress voltage decay are systematically summarized. Additionally, the design of O2-type structure and the corresponding mechanism of suppressing voltage decay are comprehensively discussed. Unfortunately, the reported O2-type LRLO cathodes still exhibit partially disordered structure with extended cycles. Herein, the factors that may cause the irreversible transition metal migrations in O2-type LRLO materials are also explored, while the perspectives and challenges for designing high-performance O2-type LRLO cathodes without voltage decay are proposed.

BACKGROUND: The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) performance of individuals with subclinical and early stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have not been systematically studied. Improved understanding will inform the natural history of HCM and factors influencing well-being. METHODS: VANISH trial (Valsartan for Attenuating Disease Evolution in Early Sarcomeric HCM) participants with early stage sarcomeric HCM (primary analysis cohort) and subclinical HCM (sarcomere variant without left ventricular hypertrophy comprising the exploratory cohort) who completed baseline and year 2 HRQOL assessment via the pediatric quality of life inventory and CPET were studied. Metrics correlating with baseline HRQOL and CPET performance were identified. The impact of valsartan treatment on these measures was analyzed in the early stage cohort. RESULTS: Two hundred participants were included: 166 with early stage HCM (mean age, 23±10 years; 40% female; 97% White; and 92% New York Heart Association class I) and 34 subclinical sarcomere variant carriers (mean age, 16±5 years; 50% female; and 100% White). Baseline HRQOL was good in both cohorts, although slightly better in subclinical HCM (composite pediatric quality of life score 84.6±10.6 versus 90.2±9.8; P =0.005). Both cohorts demonstrated mildly reduced functional status (mean percent predicted peak oxygen uptake 73±16 versus 78±12 mL/kg per minute; P =0.18). Percent predicted peak oxygen uptake and peak oxygen pulse correlated with HRQOL. Valsartan improved physical HRQOL in early stage HCM (adjusted mean change in pediatric quality of life score +4.1 versus placebo; P =0.01) but did not significantly impact CPET performance. CONCLUSIONS: Functional capacity can be impaired in young, healthy people with early stage HCM, despite New York Heart Association class I status and good HRQOL. Peak oxygen uptake was similarly decreased in subclinical HCM despite normal left ventricular wall thickness and excellent HRQOL. Valsartan improved physical pediatric quality of life scores but did not significantly impact CPET performance. Further studies are needed for validation and to understand how to improve patient experience. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov ; Unique identifier: NCT01912534.

Photocatalytic degradation of pollutants coupled with hydrogen (H2) evolution has emerged as a promising solution for environmental and energy crises. However, the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes limits photocatalytic activities. Herein, an S-scheme heterojunction carbon doped-TiO2 /ZnIn2S4 (C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4) was designed by substituting oxygen sites within C-TiO2 by ZnIn2S4. Under visible light irradiation, the optimal C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 exhibits a higher degradation efficiency (88.6%) of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), compared to pristine C-TiO2 (72.9%) and ZnIn2S4 (66.8%). Furthermore, the H2 yield of the C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 reaches 1526.9 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is 3.83 times and 2.87 times that of the C-TiO2 and ZnIn2S4, respectively. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that an internal electric field (IEF) informed in the C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction, accelerates the separation of photogenerated charge pairs, thereby enhancing photocatalytic efficiency of MC-LR degradation and H2 production. This work highlights a new perspective on the development of high-performance photocatalysts for wastewater treatment and H2 generation.

The Eastern Pontides host a diverse suite of plutonic rocks spanning a wide range of ages and compositions. Among these, the Middle Eocene Kazıkbeli pluton, located in the Kürtün district of Gümüşhane, stands out due to its distinctive petrological characteristics. This study aims to unravel the petrological implications of petrographic and mineral chemical data to constrain the physicaydınçakırochemical conditions (temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity) under which the Kazıkbeli magma crystallized and was emplaced. By integrating mineral chemical data, we seek to quantify emplacement pressure, crystallization temperature, and oxygen fugacity. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic relationships and physicochemical properties of the Kazıkbeli pluton rocks, as determined through geological, petrographic and mineral chemistry, is crucial for elucidating the geological evolution of the Eastern Pontides. The Kazıkbeli Pluton exhibits a predominant NE-SW orientation and encompasses an area of roughly 46 km². Modal mineralogical analysis reveals a compositional spectrum ranging from gabbroic diorite to monzogranite, with granodiorite and tonalite being the most prominent rock types. Textural variations encompass fine- to medium-grained, porphyritic, poikilitic, and occasionally graphic textures. The primary mineral assemblage of the pluton comprises plagioclase, orthoclase, quartz, amphibole, biotite, and Fe-Ti oxides. Accessory minerals include zircon, apatite, sphene, and allanite. Plagioclases are labradorite to oligoclase (An26 to An66) in composition. K-feldspar minerals exhibited an orthoclase composition (Or80 to Or97). All amphiboles belong to the calcic amphibole field and exhibit a magnesio-hornblende (Mg#=0.63-0.73) composition. Biotites crystallized as solidified melt products with compositions between annite and phlogopite endmembers, plotting close to the magnesium-rich (Mg#=0.52-0.58) end of the phlogopite solid solution series. Calculated crystallization temperatures derived from amphibole and biotite data range from 712°C to 824°C. Pressure estimations calculated using amphibole-plagioclase, amphibole and biotite suggest a range of 0.04 to 2.06 kbar. Oxygen fugacity (ƒO2) values calculated using amphibole and biotite fall between -12.5 and -16.1. Amphibole-based water content estimations indicate a range of 3.7% to 5.7% for the pluton. Biotite compositions within the studied Kazıkbeli pluton rocks exhibit characteristics suggestive of a potential mantle origin. Geobarometric calculations based on mineral chemistry data with geological and petrographic features indicate the emplacement of the Kazıkbeli Pluton at relatively shallow depths within the crust (~1 to 8 km).

In the metal matrix composites (MMCs) reinforced with nanoparticles, the enhancement of composite performance is often closely associated with the types of nanoparticles. It is vital to explore the influences and differences of various nanoparticles on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of highly alloyed aluminum-based composites. This study is the first to employ hot pressing for preparing Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite materials reinforced with SiC and Al 2 O 3 nano-ceramic particles, respectively. By employing hot extrusion and T6 heat treatment techniques, a systematic investigation was conducted on the effects of the addition of nano-ceramic particles on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composites, and a comparative analysis was performed on the two types of composite materials. The experimental results demonstrated that the Mg atoms in the α-Al matrix were consumed by the addition of SiC/Al 2 O 3 nano-ceramic particles, and thereby the grain size primary η’ (MgZn 2 ) strengthening phase was refined, leading to an enhanced overall mechanical performance of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite. In particular, the Mg 2 Si phase was generated by the addition of SiC nanoceramic particles, through the interfacial reactions, and thus with the synergistic effects of precipitation strengthening and Orowan strengthening, the ultimate compressive strength and compressibility of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite can be increased to 844 MPa and 27.5%, respectively. On the other hand, the addition of Al 2 O 3 nanoceramic particles can bring about the formation of an oxygen-rich phase and refined precipitates at grain boundaries. Accordingly, the elongation is increased to 43.5% while a high ultimate compressive strength in the composites can be maintained. It is anticipated that nanoceramic particle-reinforced Al-based metal composites have significant potential for achieving both high strength and exceptional ductility for the application in the industry field.

Abstract The metal‐free rocking chair type Zn‐ion batteries (ZIBs) provide a promising approach toward the promotion of the Zn‐based batteries by circumventing the challenges including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and surface corrosion. In order to sufficiently exploit the available capacity of this metal‐free batteries, it is necessary to effectively enhance the sluggish reaction kinetics of divalent zinc ions. Equally important is to achieve a balance in the kinetics between cathode and anode. Here, hetero‐valent doping and oxygen vacancy engineering are employed to effectively enhance the reaction dynamics of V 2 O 5 cathodes and MoO 3 anodes. Moreover, to the best of the knowledge, for the first time, the strategy of kinetics matching between the two electrodes is applied to the construction of rocking‐chair zinc ion batteries, enabling the cathode and anode to share similar zinc ion migration rates, and achieving a high energy density of up to 58.7 Wh kg −1 (based on the total electrode mass) as well as excellent cycling stability (90% after 500 cycles). This work demonstrates the importance of kinetics matching in zinc‐ion full‐cell performance and pave a benefitable avenue to for the pursuit of advanced multi‐valent metal‐ion batteries.

Superhydrophobic surfaces can seal the gas–liquid interface (GLI) under water to produce the drag reduction effect. Enhancing the stability and slip length of the GLI is an important issue in this context. Herein, we fabricate wettability step electrodes (WSEs) by creating an array of millimeter-scale circular superhydrophobic regions on a hydrophilic graphite plate by using an economical and efficient mask spraying method. When the WSE was electrified as an anode, the oxygen produced by the electrolytic reaction was preferentially precipitated in the superhydrophobic regions and ultimately formed an array of millimeter-scale GLIs. The evolution process of this GLI can be divided into a spreading stage and a growth stage. The results of experiments revealed that the spreading duration of the GLI increased with the diameter of the superhydrophobic regions (D) and decreased with the spacing between adjacent superhydrophobic regions (L). During the growth stage, the height of the GLI decreased with the ratio D/(L + D) and increased over the duration of electrification according to a 1/3 power-law relationship. Finally, we measured the slip characteristic on a single millimeter-scale GLI by particle image velocimetry. The result showed that the effective slip length of the GLI with a streamwise length of 2 mm can exceed 100 μm, thus confirming the potential of the millimeter-scale GLI for drag reduction.

Converting CO2 to carbon‐based fuels using solar energy via photocatalysis is a promising approach to boost carbon neutrality. However, the solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency is hampered by interconnected multiple factors including insufficient light absorption, low separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers as well as complex and sluggish surface reaction kinetics. Herein, we incorporate MnO2 nanowires and Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons with abundant oxygen vacancies (Vo) into MnO2/Co3O4 sugar‐gourd nanohybrids for boosting CO2 photoreduction. The MnO2/Co3O4 nanohybrids not only display strong absorption in the visible–near infrared region, but also facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers in terms of S‐scheme transfer pathway, supplying abundant electrons for CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, the presence of VO enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and promotes the chemical adsorption to CO2 molecules. In addition, the interfacial electronic interaction between MnO2 and Co3O4 also contributes to the chemical adsorption and activation to CO2. Owing to the synergy of S‐scheme transfer pathway and VO, the MnO2/Co3O4 hybrids exhibit greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction under the irradiation of visible light in comparison with bare MnO2 and Co3O4, delivering a CO evolution rate of 15.9 umol g−1 h−1 with a 100% selectivity.

Abstract Defect engineering is an effective strategy to enhance the enzyme‐like activity of nanozymes. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on introducing defects via de novo synthesis and post‐synthetic treatment, overlooking the dynamic evolution of defects during the catalytic process involving highly reactive oxygen species. Herein, a defect‐engineered metal–organic framework (MOF) nanozyme with mixed linkers is reported. Over twofold peroxidase (POD)‐like activity enhancement compared with unmodified nanozyme highlights the critical role of in situ defect formation in enhancing the catalytic performance of nanozyme. Experimental results reveal that highly active hydroxyl radical (•OH) generated in the catalytic process etches the 2,5‐dihydroxyterephthalic acid ligands, contributing to electronic structure modulation of metal sites and enlarged pore sizes in the framework. The self‐enhanced POD‐like activity induced by in situ defect engineering promotes the generation of •OH, holding promise in colorimetric sensing for detecting dichlorvos. Utilizing smartphone photography for RGB value extraction, the resultant sensing platform achieves the detection for dichlorvos ranging from 5 to 300 ng mL −1 with a low detection limit of 2.06 ng mL −1 . This pioneering work in creating in situ defects in MOFs to improve catalytic activity offers a novel perspective on traditional defect engineering.

Abstract Excited by intense infrared ultrafast light pulses, a wide bandgap material undergoes nonlinear ionization, generating a high density of free electrons in conduction states. As a result, the electronic band structure is critically modified and the bandgap shrinks. This induces rapid changes in optical properties, dramatically affecting the absorption spectrum during light coupling to the dielectric surface or during nonlinear propagation inside the bulk. This study analyzes the structural behavior and the modification of the optical properties of laser‐excited silica glass at the molecular cluster level through first‐principles simulations. Employing density functional theory and the GW approximations for band structure under nonequilibrium conditions, alongside the Bethe–Salpeter equation, the dynamics of the optical properties of fused silica are comprehensively explored. The behavior of excited fused silica in a wide photon energy range (from a few to 20 eV) is thus predicted. Laser‐induced electron excitation triggers a redistribution of charges between oxygen and silicon atoms, accompanied by a significant increase in electronic pressure, local atomic structure rearrangement, and material expansion. Molecular dynamics simulations offer a temporal perspective on the excited state dynamics, unveiling the intricate interplay between electronic and atomic effects on bandgap evolution. The analysis sheds light on excitonic resonances, intraband and interband transitions in fused silica under ultrafast laser irradiation, providing valuable insights into its excited state behavior and optical properties.

Abstract We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of ∼20 au that straddles the L–T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with on-axis host star spectra, which provides self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 ± 3 km s −1 and carbon monoxide and water mass fractions of logCO = −2.3 ± 0.3 and logH 2 O = −2.7 ± 0.2, respectively. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 ± 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 ± 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L–T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high v sin i and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures to which we are sensitive. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation to the breakup velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of >200 very low-mass objects ( M ≲ 0.1 M ⊙ ) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated low-mass field objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.

Two cool-season putting green turfgrass species, annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass, are differential in ice encasement tolerance. Physiological mechanisms associated with creeping bentgrass ice encasement tolerance and annual bluegrass susceptibility are not understood. The objectives were to evaluate oxygen, ethylene, and CO 2 content within the upper soil space of the plants while frozen and immediately after ice melt after 0, 5, 10, 20, and 28 days of ice encasement (2.54 cm of ice) in growth chamber conditions. Following ice melt, plant samples were separated into leaf, crown, and root tissues and used to evaluate carbohydrate and amino acid content. Annual bluegrass exhibited higher damage (slower recovery rates) on most sampling days compared with creeping bentgrass. The organs that were most damaged and exhibited a differential principal component analysis snapshot, were the leaf and crown tissues. Creeping bentgrass may preserve leaf and crown tissues for postwinter recovery whereas significant metabolic changes occur in annual bluegrass leaves and crowns. Creeping bentgrass retained total amino acids in leaves following ice encasement whereas total leaf amino acid levels declined in annual bluegrass. Specific carbohydrates and amino acids such as the ability to maintain high levels of fructose, asparagine, and proline may be important indicators of the tolerance to ice encasement stress. On the basis of more prominent carbohydrate and amino acid loss in leaves and crowns and higher levels of CO 2 evolution, annual bluegrass may exhibit a higher metabolism and/or tissue damage during ice encasement compared with creeping bentgrass, which could reduce spring recuperative potential.
