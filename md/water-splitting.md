Abstract The commercialization of rechargeable Zn–air batteries (ZABs) relies on the material innovation to accelerate the sluggish oxygen electrocatalysis kinetics. Due to the differentiated mechanisms of reverse processes, i.e., oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), rationally integrating dual sites for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis is prerequisite yet remains challenging. Herein, multicomponent synergistic active sites within highly graphitic carbon substrate are exquisitely constructed, which is accomplished by fluorine (F) modulation strategy. The incorporation of F dopants facilitates pyridinic N formation for anchoring single metal sites, thus guaranteeing the coexistence of sufficient M–N x sites and metal nanoparticles toward bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. As a result, the optimal catalyst, denoted as F NH 2 ‐FeNi‐800, outperforms commercial Pt/C+RuO 2 with smaller gap between E j = 10 and E 1/2 (Δ E ) of 0.63 V (vs 0.7 V for Pt/C+RuO 2 ), demonstrating its superior bifunctionality. Beyond that, its superiority is validated in homemade rechargeable ZABs. ZABs assembled using F NH 2 ‐FeNi‐800 as the air cathode delivers higher peak power density (123.8 mW cm −2 ) and long‐cycle lifetime (over 660 cycles) in comparison with Pt/C@RuO 2 (68.8 mW cm −2 ; 300 cycles). The finding not only affords a highly promising oxygen electrocatalyst, but also opens an avenue to constructing multifunctional active sites for heterogeneous catalysts.

Abstract Photosystem II (PSII) catalyses the oxidation of water through a four-step cycle of S i states ( i = 0–4) at the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster 1–3 , during which an extra oxygen (O6) is incorporated at the S 3 state to form a possible dioxygen 4–7 . Structural changes of the metal cluster and its environment during the S-state transitions have been studied on the microsecond timescale. Here we use pump-probe serial femtosecond crystallography to reveal the structural dynamics of PSII from nanoseconds to milliseconds after illumination with one flash (1F) or two flashes (2F). Y Z , a tyrosine residue that connects the reaction centre P680 and the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster, showed structural changes on a nanosecond timescale, as did its surrounding amino acid residues and water molecules, reflecting the fast transfer of electrons and protons after flash illumination. Notably, one water molecule emerged in the vicinity of Glu189 of the D1 subunit of PSII (D1-E189), and was bound to the Ca 2+ ion on a sub-microsecond timescale after 2F illumination. This water molecule disappeared later with the concomitant increase of O6, suggesting that it is the origin of O6. We also observed concerted movements of water molecules in the O1, O4 and Cl-1 channels and their surrounding amino acid residues to complete the sequence of electron transfer, proton release and substrate water delivery. These results provide crucial insights into the structural dynamics of PSII during S-state transitions as well as O–O bond formation.

MoS2 is a promising alternative to Pt in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its low cost. To enhance the catalytic properties of the 2H MoS2 inert basal plane, we propose an approach of employing oxygen incorporated MoS2 as a catalyst for HER. Different density of oxygen substitution doped monolayer MoS2 samples (MoS1.51O0.49, MoS1.55O0.45, MoS1.67O0.33) were achieved by chemical vapor deposition method and their catalytic performance were tested. Experimentally, we demonstrate that oxygen substitution can activate the inert basal plane and the catalytic performance is dependent on the oxygen substitution percentage. Also, combining with DFT calculations, we confirm that oxygen substitution act as catalytic sites. Our work provides a strategy for enhancing of monolayer MoS2 HER activities through in situ substitution doping.

The construction of low-cost and highly efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysts is paramount for clean and sustainable hydrogen energy. In recent years, metal–organic framework (MOF) OER electrocatalysts have attracted tremendous research attention. Herein, we report a simple and facile strategy to construct bimetallic MOFs (named CoMn0.01) for enhancing OER catalytic performance. Significantly, CoMn0.01 exhibited remarkable OER activity (255 mV at 10 mA cm–2) and a low Tafel slope of 66 mV dec–1, superior to those of commercial benchmark electrocatalysts (RuO2, 352 mV, 178 mV dec–1). Besides, the catalyst demonstrated outstanding longevity for 144 h at a current density of 100 mA cm –2. Mn doping can regulate the electronic structure of Co MOFs, which optimizes charge transfer capability and improves conductivity.

The photocatalytic activity and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of MoS2 and silk graphene (silk G) composite synthesized using supercritical fluids and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods were investigated for their potential application in photocatalysis. This material was subjected to characterize by XRD, TEM, SEM and FTIR techniques to demonstrate that MoS2/silk G composite still existed in the supercritical fluids methods obtained MoS2 & MoS2/silk G. The optical features of MoS2 was improved by introduction of silk G, which inturn caused shift in band gap from 1.65 to 1.85 eV. Within visible region, creation of high electron-hole pairs is possible by adequate band gap modifications. The fast movement of photo-induced charge carrier can be enhanced by silk G as they decrease the recombination activity. Additionally, the MoS2/silk G shows high oxygen evolution reaction with low Tafel slope of 157.2 mV dec-1 and low overpotential of 603 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The present study signifies that with addition of silk G in the MoS2 host improved the photocatalytic activity by 13% and electrocatalytic activity by nearly 5% compared to bare MoS2 nanoparticles.

Abstract The engineering of amorphous metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) offers potential opportunities for the construction of electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, highly efficient OER performance and durability in alkaline electrolyte are discovered for MOF‐derived amorphous and porous electrocatalysts, which are synthesized in a brief procedure and can be facilely produced in scalable quantities. The structural inheritance of MOF amorphous catalysts is significant for the retention of catalytic sites and the diffusion of electrolytes, and the presence of Fe sites can change the electronic structure and effectively control the adsorption behavior of important intermediates, accelerating reaction kinetics. The obtained amorphous A‐FeNi can be transformed from FeNi‐MOF effortlessly and instantly, and it only needs low overpotentials of 152 and 232 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm −2 with a Tafel slope of 17 mV dec −1 in 1 m KOH for OER. Moreover, A‐FeNi possesses high corrosion resistance and durability, therefore A‐FeNi can work continually for at least 400 h at 100 mA cm −2 . This work may pave a new avenue for the design of MOFs‐related amorphous electrocatalyst.

Efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important for water electrolysis and advanced hydrogen production energy. However, the sluggish kinetics of this reaction require significant overpotentials, leading to high energy consumption. Therefore, developing OER electrocatalysts with exceptional performance and long-term durability is crucial for enhancing the energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the hydrogen production process. In this paper, novel FeOOH/Co9S8 catalysts were prepared through a two-step hydrothermal reaction followed by one-step electrodeposition on nickel foam substrates for an alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The as-obtained catalysts possessed abundant non-homogeneous interfaces between FeOOH and Co9S8 nanosheets, conducive to optimized coordination environments of Fe and Co sites through the redistribution of interfacial charges. This strengthened the chemisorption of oxygenated intermediates, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics, abundant active sites, and enhanced OER properties. The optimized electrocatalyst FeOOH/Co9S8 achieved a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 248 mV coupled with good stability for over 140 h. Overall, a novel approach for producing effective and durable alkaline dielectric OER electrocatalysts was proposed, useful for future manufacturing of advanced energy devices.

Due to the high cost of precious metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), producing outstandingly efficient electrocatalysts with low affordability is significant for generating pollution-free and renewable energy via electrochemical processes. Herein, a facile hydrothermal approach is employed to synthesize a hybrid mesoporous iron-nickel bimetallic sulfides @ P,N-doped carbon for OER. The as-prepared Fe0.5NiS2@C exhibited overpotentials (η) of 250 mV at 10 mA/cm2, which exceeded those that were recently reported using surface-modified P, N-doped carbon-based catalysts for OER in 1M KOH medium. Moreover, the Fe0.5NiS2@C catalyst showed a notable Tafel slope of 90.5 mV/dec with long-dated stability even after 24 h at 10 mA/cm2. The superior OER performance of Fe0.5NiS2@C catalysts may be due to the enormous surface area, sheets-like morphology with abundant active sites, fast transfer of mass and electrons, control of electronic structure by co-treatment with heteroatoms (e.g., P and N), and synergistic effect of bimetallic sulfides, making it a favorable catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. The density functional theory (DFT) displays that the Fe0.5NiS2@C catalyst exhibits strong H2O-adsorption energy. This result could be one of the explanations explaining the high catalytic activity.

Due to the depletion of fossil energy on earth, it is crucial to develop resource rich and efficient non-precious metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we synthesized an efficient and economical electrocatalyst using a simple self-assembly strategy. Firstly, rod-shaped MIL-88A was synthesized by hydrothermal method. Then, the surface of MIL-88A was functionalized and encapsulated in zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) by hydrothermal method. The combination of MIL-88A and ZIF-67 resulted in a slight ion-exchange reaction between Co2+ and the surface of MIL-88A to generate CoFe-LDH@ZIF-67 core-shell structure. Afterwards, in the presence of Mo6+, ZIF-67 was converted into CoMo-nanocages through ion-exchange reactions, forming a core-shell structure of MoCoFe hydr (oxy) oxide@CoMo-LDH (MoCoFe-HO@CoMo-LDH). Due to the advantages of core-shell structure and composition, this material exhibits excellent OER characteristics, with a small Tafel slope (45.11 mV dec-1) and low overpotential (324 mV) at 10 mA cm-2. It exhibits good stability in alkaline media. This research work provides a novel approach for the development of efficient and economical non-precious metal electrocatalysts.

The Oxygen evolution reaction is in high demand for clean energy applications, particularly in water splitting for hydrogen production. Researchers are actively developing efficient catalyst designs to improve OER performance, contributing to solutions for global energy and environmental challenges. This study focused on the synthesis of nickel hydroxide as an efficient catalyst for OER using two different precursors: nickelocene and nickel sulfate tetrahydrate (NiSO4.4H2O). The characterizations showed that the sample prepared using nickelocene as a precursor (Ni(OH)2-N), had a hexagonal shape, uniform size, and was highly crystalline, while the sample prepared using nickel sulfate tetrahydrate (Ni(OH)2-NS) had a spherical shape, non-uniform sizes and low order of crystallinity. The electrochemical performance for the OER of the samples was evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry in a solution of 1M potassium hydroxide (KOH). The results demonstrate that the Ni(OH)2-N sample exhibited a lower overpotential (274 mV) compared to the Ni(OH)2-NS sample (495 mV) at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The low overpotential may be due to the high crystallinity in the sample that possesses a large number of well-defined crystalline domains, which act as efficient charge transport pathways during the oxygen evolution reaction, leading to improved reaction kinetics and overall performance. This suggests that nickel hydroxide synthesized using nickelocene may be a promising alternative to noble metals and provides a basis for further work on the development of new electro-catalysts.

High‐performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components in energy conversion and storage technologies. Yet, their poor reversibility hinders their applicability. A highly active ORR/OER catalyst, consisting of multiwalled carbon nanotubes‐supported MnFeNiOx nanoparticles, was subjected to sequences of chronoamperometric steps alternating between the ORR, the OER and highly cathodic potentials (Ec). Rotating ring disk electrode methods revealed that applying Ec leads to a small increase in the current and peroxide species yield during the ORR while enhancing substantially the OER. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy showed irreversible changes in the chemical state of MnFeNiOx correlating with its catalytic properties. The complexity of changes that a composite catalyst may undergo under varying potentials, the importance of monitoring product formation, and the convenience of using dynamic electrochemical sequences for the assessment of catalyst reversibility, as well as for the activation and/or restoration of their catalytic properties are highlighted.

Developing cost-effective, efficient and stable air cathodes, involving oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER), is the crux of the large-scale application of reversible Zinc-air batteries. Herein, 1D/2D hierarchical N doping carbon architecture encapsulating FeCo nanoalloys were successfully constructed by one-step annealing leaf-like ZnFeCo-ZIFs. Benefiting from the unique 1D/2D hierarchical porous feature with high specific surface area, sufficient accessible catalytic sites, not easy entanglements and efficient electron and mass transfer capacity, as well as the advantages of the strong electronic coupling in FeCo alloys, the as-prepared FeCo@1D-CNTs/2D-NC catalysts exhibited prominent bifunctional oxygen catalytical performances with a positive half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.87 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) for the oxygen reduction reaction and a low overpotential (η10 = 396 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 for the oxygen evolution reaction, manifesting a low reversible potential gap (ΔE = 0.756 V). The zinc-air battery equipped with FeCo@1D-CNTs/2D-NC as the cathode catalyst exhibited a higher peak power density (98.2 mW cm–2) and specific capacity (741 mAh gZn–1) than that assembled with the commercial Pt/C This study provides a convenient strategy to explore non-precious metal based bifunctional electrocatalysts for reversible Zinc-air battery scale applications.

Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activated by metal oxides has been developed as a promising approach for advanced oxidation processes in the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater; however, rapid and effective activation of PMS still lacks reasonable catalyst-oriented design. Here, by fabricating a Co3O4–La2O3 bimetallic oxide electrode to implement defect engineering, we report an oxygen vacancy (OV)-mediated PMS activation electrocatalytic system for degradation of tetracycline (TC). The rare earth metal oxide La2O3 was used to modify Co3O4 and introduce OVs as active sites, where PMS is activated to produce reactive species. OVs in the Co3O4–La2O3 composites facilitate the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2), which mediates the activation of PMS via a non-radical pathway. When the ratio of Co to La was 2:1, the system Co3O4–La2O3/PMS had a degradation efficiency for TC of more than 97.50% and a mineralization rate of up to 62.97% within 40 min. Overall, the findings on the defect-engineered materials for antibiotic degradation could provide an effective strategy for the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater with low energy consumption and pollution.

Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extremely important to sustainable energy conversion and storage, but improved efficiency is largely hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics. Dense and bimetal ruthenates have emerged as one of the promising substitutes to replace single-metal ruthenium or iridium oxides, but the fundamental understanding the role of A-site cations is still blurring. Herein, a family of lanthanides (Ln = all the lanthanides except Pm) are applied to synthesize pyrochlore lanthanide ruthenates (Ln2Ru2O7), and only Ln2Ru2O7 (Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, or Lu) with pure phase can be obtained by the ambient-pressure calcination. Compared with the perovskite ruthenates (SrRuO3) and rutile RuO2, the [RuO6] units in these Ln2Ru2O7 present the largely distorted configurations and different energy level splitting to prevent the excessive Ru oxidation and dissolution, which leads the primary improvement in the electrocatalytic OER performance. In the similar crystalline field split states, the charge transfer between [RuO6] units and Ln3+ cations also affect catalytic activities, even in the Ln2Ru2O7 surface reconstruction during the OER process. Consequently, Tb2Ru2O7 showed the highest OER performance among all the prepared Ln2Ru2O7 with similar morphologies and crystallization. This systematic work gives fundamental cognition to rational design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts in proper water electrolysis technologies.

Oxygen vacancy (OVac) and interface engineering are effective tactics for regulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts and optimizing the absorption/desorption of reactants and intermediates on the catalyst surface to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a self-supported electrocatalyst, comprising δ-MnO2 nanosheets grown on Co single atoms (CoSAs) anchored on N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) embedded with Co nanoparticle on a carbon cloth (CC) (δ-MnO2/CoNP@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC), was fabricated. Through in-situ growth of δ-MnO2 nanosheets on CoNP@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC, the number of OVac is increased, as proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Positron annihilation lifetime spectrometer (PALS), due to the redox between MnO2 and Co. Experimental results and theoretical calculations confirm that the formation of OVac rich δ-MnO2 nanosheets and the construction of heterogeneous interface between δ-MnO2 and CoSAs-NCNTs endow the electrocatalyst with good conductivity, fast charge transfer, and multiple active sites, leading to rapid OER reaction kinetics. Therefore, the δ-MnO2/CoNP@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC electrocatalyst demonstrates remarkable OER performance, requiring only 165 mV overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline solution.

To develop the high-efficiency and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is very important and challenging for the rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The sluggish ion/electron transport kinetics observed during the OER and ORR processes with the Co2P electrocatalyst can be attributed to the strong binding force between the surface Co atoms and the adsorbed intermediates. Herein, the electronic structure optimization is conducted to enhance the ORR and OER electrocatalytic activities of Co2P nanoparticles by doping iron ions. The results show that the Fe doping enable adjust the electronic structure of the Co atom and lower the energy barrier of RDS. Compared with Co2P@NCNT, the (Co0.90Fe0.10)2P@NCNT exhibit higher onset and half-wave potential (0.92 and 0.85 V vs. RHE, respectively) during the ORR process, and lower overpotential (380 mV, the current density is 10 mA∙cm−2) during the OER process. As expected, the ZABs base on (Co0.90Fe0.10)2P@NCNT electrocatalyst display an outstanding specific capacity (928.50 mAh∙g−1Zn), and an excellent peak power density (246.8 mW∙cm−2). This promising work may contribute to the fabrication of efficient electrocatalyst for ZABs.

In recent years, researchers have been actively investigating metal oxide-based materials with narrow bandgaps due to their potential applications toward wastewater treatment and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). In this study, we successfully synthesized g-C3N4 (GCN), Fe2O3, and Fe2O3/g-C3N4 (FGCN) using thermal polymerization and hydrothermal methods. We characterized the physicochemical and structural properties of these materials through various analytical techniques including XRD, FT-IR, UV-DRS, XPS, FE-SEM, and HR-TEM analyses, confirming the effective construction of the FGCN composite catalyst. We evaluated the photocatalytic activity of Fe2O3, GCN, and FGCN composite catalysts by assessing their ability to degrade rhodamine B (RhB) and crystal violet (CV) by exposing them to sunlight for 150 min. Among these catalysts, the FGCN composite demonstrated excellent photocatalytic performance, achieving 93 % and 95 % degradation of RhB and CV, respectively, under 150 min of sunlight exposure. The developed Fe2O3/g-C3N4@Nickel foam (FGCN@NF) composite catalyst exhibits remarkable OER performance, with a reduced Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec and a low overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and shows excellent durable performance over a long time (15 h). Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analysis confirmed the mineralization of both dyes. The photocatalytic performance remained largely unchanged after five consecutive experiments, demonstrating excellent reusability and photostability. Trapping experiments revealed that O2●– is the main species responsible for the photocatalytic decomposition of various dyes by the FGCN composite catalyst. Therefore, the development of a versatile photo/electrocatalytic system that can efficiently promote energy conversion in environmental applications has attracted great attention.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays an important role in many electrocatalysis-related fields. However, the slow kinetics of the OER seriously hinders energy efficiency. Here, we synthesize flower-like Co–Fe–Cr–Mo medium-entropy spinel (MES) nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) using one-step solvothermal method for the OER. Due to high stability and compositional diversity, the CoFeCrMoOx/NF catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic OER performance with an overpotential of only 196 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in 1.0 M KOH solution, much lower than CoFeCrMnOx/NF, CoFeCrCeOx/NF, CoFeCrSnOx/NF, CoFeCrAlOx/NF, and commercial IrO2 catalysts, reflecting that the formation of flower-like MES has a positive effect on the improvement of OER performance. The introduction of Mo increases active sites, promotes electron transfer, accelerates the adsorption and desorption of the OER intermediates, reduces the energy barrier, and thus improves the performance of the OER. In situ Raman spectra indicate that the surface CoOOH and FeOOH species are important active components for the OER.

Abstract The bifunctional air electrodes with numerous dual-active sites and low cost are desirable to modify the performance of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Metal–oxygen-nitrogen–carbon substrate (M = Mn, Fe, Ni, etc.) and NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets are excellent catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, respectively. Here, we investigated a bifunctional electrocatalytic substrate with 3D core-shell hierarchical architecture by anchoring high OER-active NiFe-LDH on ORR-active FeMnZIF-8@gC3N4-derived FeMnON-N doped carbon nanotubes with bamboo like (NiFe-LDH@FeMnON-NC). This nano composite has unique features such as robust synergistic effects, high conductivity, balance, and optimization of surface chemical valences of Fe, Mn, and Ni atoms to boost the bifunctional ORR and OER properties and stability in ZABs. The NiFe-LDH@FeMnON-NC nanocomposite not only exhibited superior OER electroactivity with a low onset overpotential of 235 mV (10 mA cm−2), but also have excellent ORR activity with current density of -5.48 mAcm-2 and onset potential of 1.04 V, which is better than or comparable to those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2. Rechargeable ZABs constructed by bifunctional NiFe-LDH@FeMnON-NC have a peak power density (235.41 mW cm−2), open-circuit potential (OCV) (1.53 V), small discharge/charge band gap of 0.74 V and excellent discharge stability.

The implementation of water electrolysis technology is hampered by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction. In an attempt to solve this issue, anodes which are able to respond to external stimuli such as magnetic field and light were successfully prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, using Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (FTO/Fe3O4) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles together with tetrathiafulvalene as photosensitizer (FTO/Fe3O4/TTF). This technique allowed obtaining highly stable and homogeneous anodes in a simple and reproducible way. The electrodes produced a catalytic effect on the water oxidation reaction, without the use of a noble-metal, and proved to be sensitive to a 365 nm LED light as well as to an external magnetic field. Water oxidation reaction was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry, by the Tafel slopes and also by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work presents new perspectives for the water oxidation reaction, using electrodes fabricated by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and catalyzed through the use of external stimuli such as light and magnetic fields.

Identifying a universal activity descriptor for metal oxides, akin to the d‐band center for transition metals, remains a significant challenge in catalyst design, largely due to the intricate electronic structures of metal oxides. This review highlights a major advancement in formulating the number of excess electrons (NEE) as an activity descriptor for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on reducible metal oxide surfaces. We elaborate on the quantitative relationship between NEE and the adsorption properties of OER intermediates, and unveil the decisive role of the octet rule on the OER performance of these oxides. This insight provides a robust theoretical basis for designing effective OER catalysts. Moreover, we discuss critical experimental evidence supporting this theory and summarize recent advances in employing NEE as a guiding principle for developing highly efficient OER catalysts experimentally.

In recent years, a series of noble metals and transition metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been explored for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The unique structural and electronic features of the SACs facilitate the OER with maximum atomic utilization. As a result, a high turnover frequency is achieved with SACs. In this chapter, we have summarized the fundamentals of the SACs and their design strategies for electrochemical OER. The detailed characterization of the SACs and its utilization in OER has been discussed with suitable examples. The principles and reaction mechanism of electrochemical OER with SACs have been discussed looking at the structure of the active catalyst and reaction intermediates.

Poly(heptazine imides) (PHIs) have emerged as prominent layered carbon nitride-based materials with potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity owing to their strong VIS light absorption, long excited-state lifetimes, high surface-to-volume ratios, and the possibility of tuning their properties via hosting different metal ions in their pores. A series of metal-ion-doped PHI-M (M = K+, Rb+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) were first systematically explored using density functional theory calculations. These simulations led an in-depth understanding of the microscopic OER mechanism in these systems and identified PHI-Co2+ as the best OER catalyst of this family of PHIs, whereas PHI-Mn2+ can be an alternative promising OER catalyst. This level of performance was attributed to a thermodynamically favorable formation of the reaction intermediates as well as its red-shifted absorption in the VIS region involving the population of long-lived states, as revealed by time-dependent density functional theory calculations. We further demonstrated that the electronic properties of the *OH intermediates (Bader population, crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis, and adsorption energies) are reliable descriptors to anticipate the OER activity of this family of PHIs. This rational analysis paved the way toward the prediction of the OER performance of another PHI-M derivative, i.e., PHI-Fe2+. The computationally explored PHI-Fe2+, PHI-Mn2+, and PHI-Co2+ systems were then synthesized alongside PHI-K+, and their photocatalytic OER activities were assessed. These experimental findings confirmed the best photocatalytic OER performance for PHI-Co2+ with an oxygen production of 31.2 μmol·h–1 that is 60 times higher than the pristine g-C3N4 (0.5 μmol·h–1), whereas PHI-Fe2+ and PHI-Mn2+ are seen as alternative OER catalysts with attractive oxygen production of 11.20 and 4.69 μmol·h–1, respectively. Decisively, this joint experimental–computational study reveals PHI-Co2+ to be among the best of the OER catalysts so far reported in the literature including some perovskites.

Although metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are now a hot candidate for improving the kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), direct application of them is challenging due to their poor intrinsic conductivity and internal active sites. Here, we successfully introduced halogen atoms into the octahedral topological structure of Ni based MOF materials, achieving an impressive improvement in OER activity. Accordingly, the as-obtained halogen-containing Ni based MOF ball-flowers (X-Ni-MOF BFs, X = F, Cl, Br and I) exhibit significantly enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity with an increase in electronegativity. The optimal F-Ni-MOF BFs possess an ultra-low overpotential of 222 mV at 10 mA cm−2, ∼70 mV lower than Ni-MOF nanosheets. Further research demonstrates that the introduction of halogen atoms can cause NiO6 octahedral distortion and strong electronic interactions between halogen and the adjacent Ni atoms, resulting in rapid reaction kinetics and lower electron transfer barriers. This work provides a reference for designing excellent electrocatalysts by adjusting their topological structure.

Transition metal hydroxides have great potential as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, while its low reaction kinetics and unsatisfactory stability limits the further application. Herein, Co(OH)2 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies defects and anchored Ir atoms and clusters (Ir/D-Co(OH)2) were prepared by electrochemical deposition and in-situ etching. The Introduction of Ir species is beneficial to regulate the valence electron configuration on Co 3d orbit and enhance the conductivity, which contributes to improving kinetics of Co(OH)2. In addition, the introduced defects not only regulate the adsorption energy barrier of reaction intermediates, but also serve as anchor centers for stabilizing Ir atoms and clusters, thus enhancing the active surface area and catalytic stability. The Ir/D-Co(OH)2/NF catalyst owns ultralow OER potential of 270.5 mV at 100 mA cm-2, and it has superior long-term stability under high current density of 100 mA cm-2 for 100 hours. This work provides a simple method to design noble atoms loaded transition metal hydroxides with specific defects for enhancing OER performance and high stability.

Developing the facile, universal and scale-up method to prepare electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is crucial for the high-efficient hydrogen production through water splitting. Herein, we load the CeO2 nanoparticles on the various metal foams by a very simple and scalable impregnation method. Taking iron-nickel foam (INF) as an example, we can obtain a high-efficient OER and MOR electrocatalyst of CeO2@INF-0.6. CeO2@INF-0.6 shows the superior electrocatalytic activities toward both OER and MOR with the oxidation potentials of 1.52 V and 1.47 V at 100 mA cm-2, respectively. This can be ascribed to the CeO2@INF-0.6 with strong adsorption and fast conversion ability of OH- in the alkaline electrolyte. CeO2@INF-0.6 also has good stability and selectivity in MOR-assisted alkaline water splitting, and the Faraday efficiency of formate is up to 99.2% at 1.42 V (vs. RHE). In addition, the Na+ and Cl- ions with high concentrations almost have the negligible effects on the OER and MOR activities of our CeO2@INF-0.6 in the alkaline solution. This indicates that using CeO2@INF-0.6 as anode for seawater electrolysis not only can greatly reduce the energy consumption, but produce the value-added anode product of formate.

Hydroxide ion (OH−) adsorption is an important step in promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. This study aims to design a rational catalyst to obtain several OH− adsorption sites to achieve excellent OER performance: NiO was selected as the main catalyst, and a Co0.1Ni0.9O catalyst was prepared with 10 % lattice substitution of Co2+ ions. The Co0.1Ni0.9O surface was capsulated with amorphous carbon to prevent corrosion by strong alkaline media. XPS analysis revealed that Ni2+ ion defects occurred in the Co0.1Ni0.9O crystal, and highly oxidized Ni3+ ions were mixed to attain the desired stoichiometric ratio. Electrophilic Ni2O3 in a highly oxidized state promotes attack from OH− ions, which is a nucleophile, and easily transforms into a NiOOH intermediate, which ultimately leads to the rapid progress of OER. That is, the strong covalent nature between Ni3+−O2− in the Co0.1Ni0.9O/CP electrode promotes charge transfer between the cationic metal surface and the OH− adsorbate, thereby accelerating OER. Moreover, C-capsulation in the Co0.1Ni0.9O particles reduces the band gap owing to the filling of the electrons from C between the Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals. Consequently, this improved the conductivity of the electrode, effectively reducing the ohmic potential drop and energy loss between the catalyst and the current collector. Therefore, the overpotential reached by this electrode at 10 mA cm−2 was greatly reduced to 332 mV, the Tafel slope was low at 91.98 mV dec−1, and during OER with a Faraday efficiency of 94.7 %. Moreover, this excellent performance remained stable even after 10 d.

The development of highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on more cost-effective and earth-abundant elements is of great significance and still faces a huge challenge. In this work, a series of transition metal (TM) embedding a new-defined monolayer carbon nitride phase is theoretically profiled and constructed as a catalytic platform for OER studies. Typically, a four-step screening strategy was proposed to rapidly identified high performance candidates and the coordination structure and catalytic performance relationship was thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the eliminating criterion was established to condenses valid range based on the Gibbs free energy of OH*. Our results reveal that the as-constructed 2FeCN/P exhibits superior activity toward OER with an ultralow overpotential of 0.25 V, at the same time, the established 3FeCN/S configuration performed well as a bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysis with extremely lower overpotential ηOER/ηORR of 0.26/0.48 V. Overall, this work provides an effective framework for screening advanced OER catalysts, which can also be extended to the complex multistep catalytic reactions.

Transition metal-based precatalysts are typically voltage-activated before electrochemical testing in the condition of alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. Nevertheless, the impact of voltage on the catalyst and the anion dissolution is frequently disregarded. In this study, Fe-doped NiMoO4 (Fe-NiMoO4) was synthesized as a precursor through a straightforward hydrothermal method, and MoFe-modified Ni (oxygen) hydroxide (MoFe-NiOxHy) was obtained via cyclic voltammetry (CV) activation. The effects of voltage on Fe-NiMoO4 and the dissolved inactive MoO42− ions in the process were examined in relation to OER performance. It has demonstrated that the crystallinity of the catalyst is reduced by voltage, thereby enhancing its electrocatalytic activity. The electron distribution state can be adjusted during the application of voltage, leading to the generation of additional active sites and an acceleration in the reaction rate. Additionally, MoO42− exhibits potential dependence during its dissolution. In the OER process, the dissolution of MoO42− enhances the reconstruction degree of Fe-NiMoO4 into the active substance and expedites the formation of active Ni(Fe)OOH. Hence, the optimized MoFe-NiOxHy exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic performance, with a current density of 100 mA cm−2 achieved at an overpotential of only 256 mV. This discovery contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of alkaline OER performance under the influence of applied voltage and the presence of inactive oxygen ions, offering a promising avenue for the development of efficient electrocatalysts.

Hydrogen production from proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). RuO2 has attracted considerable attention due to its low reaction overpotential, but its inferior stability remains a major challenge. Herein, a strategy is proposed to enhance the catalytic activity and stability of CoRuOx nanoparticles by doping Co and regulating the ordering degree of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by air annealing. It was found that the CoRuOx@CNTs-300 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic activity and stability when the annealing temperature was 300 °C. At the current density of 10 mA cm-2, the overpotential of this catalyst was only 201 mV, which was nearly 100 mV lower than that of commercial RuO2 (300 mV). Surprisingly, there was no significant increase in the overpotential when tested at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for 50 h. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the high activity of the catalyst is due to the electronic coupling of CoRuOx nanoparticles and CNTs, and that the introduction of Co and CNTs improves the electronic structure and solvation energies of the Ru in the active site, dramatically increasing the structural stability.
