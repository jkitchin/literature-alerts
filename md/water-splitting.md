Photoelectrochemical water splitting on n-type semiconductors is highly dependent on catalysis of the rate-determining reaction of O2 evolution. Conventionally, in electrochemistry and photoelectrochemistry O2 evolution is catalyzed by metal oxide catalysts like IrO2 and RuO2, whereas noble metals such as Pt are considered unsuitable for this purpose. However, our study finds that Pt, in its single-atom form, exhibits exceptional cocatalytic properties for photoelectrochemical water oxidation on a TiO2 photoanode, in contrast to Pt in a nanoparticle form. The decoration of Pt single atoms onto TiO2 yields a remarkable current density of 5.89 mA cm–2 at 1.23 VRHE, surpassing bare TiO2 (or Pt nanoparticle decorated TiO2) by 2.52 times. Notably, this enhancement remains consistent over a wide pH range. By accompanying theoretical work, we assign this significant enhancement to an improved charge transfer and separation efficiency along with accelerated kinetics in the oxygen evolution reaction facilitated by the presence of Pt single atoms on the TiO2 surface.

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered considerable attention as promising nanocatalysts for effectively utilizing Pt in catalysis toward oxygen reduction reactions due to their unique properties. Nonetheless, there is a relative dearth of attention regarding the structural evolution of HEAs in response to electrochemical conditions. In this work, we propose a thermal reduction method to synthesize high entropy nanoparticles by leveraging the confinement effect and abundant nitrogen-anchored sites provided by pyrolyzed metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Notably, the prepared catalysts exhibit enhanced activity accompanied by structural reconstruction during electrochemical activation, approaching 1 order of magnitude higher mass activity compared to Pt/C in oxygen reduction. Atomic-scale structural characterization reveals that abundant defects and single atoms are formed during the activation process, contributing to a significant boost in the catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reactions. This study provides deep insights into surface reconstruction engineering during electrochemical operations, with practical implications for fuel cell applications.

Highly efficient, abundant, and long-lasting electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution will be essential to industrial hydrogen production via water splitting. Hydrogen has emerged as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels, a sustainable and green energy source. Water electrolysis via co-doped metal oxides has been employed to reduce energy loss during electrochemical oxygen evolution reactions (OER), a great alternative to noble-metal-derived electrocatalysts. In the present work, Nd-dopped CeO2 (CeNdO2) nanostructures co-doped with rare earth metals are fabricated via sol-gel technique and analysed via state-of-the-art methods, focusing on structural, morphological, elemental, electrical and electronic capabilities. All fabricated samples were coated on nickel foam (NF) and fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) substrate for electrochemical splitting of water in a 1.0 M KOH. The Pr/Nd co-doped CeO2 grown on NF demonstrates high electrochemical activity with a significantly reduced OER overpotential of around 274 mV, Tafel slope around 84 mV/dec, and increased electrochemical surface area. This co-doped metal oxide nanostructure causes interactions with oxy-radicals (confirmed from XPS and Raman), which are thought to be source of easy charge transport and decrease overpotential. The least charge transfer resistance of Pr-doped CeNdO2/NF presented excellent electroactivity due to reduced polarization resistance between electrolyte and catalyst material. Additionally, for a practical water electrolysis system, the high stability of Pr doped CeNdO2/NF electrode was exposed by continuous cyclic voltammetry sweeps of electrolysis up to 1500 cycles. This work reveals a synergistic effect between metal atoms (Ce, Nd, and Pr) on nickel foam substrate, which is mainly responsible for electron transfer and well-balanced kinetics under beginning conditions.

Zn-air batteries are a highly promising clean energy sustainable conversion technology, and the design of dual-function electrocatalysts with excellent activity and stability is crucial for their development. In this work, FeCo alloy loaded biomass-based N and S co-doped carbon aerogels (FeCo@NS-LCA) were fabricated from chitosan and lignosulfonate-metal chelates via liquid nitrogen pre-frozen synergistic high-temperature carbonization with application in electrocatalytic reactions. The abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on lignosulfonates have a chelating effect on metal ions, which can avoid the aggregation of metal nanoparticles during carbonation and catalysis, facilitating the construction of a nanoconfinement catalytic system with biomass carbon as the domain-limiting body and FeCo nanoparticles as the active sites. FeCo@NS-LCA exhibited catalytic activity (E1/2 = 0.87 V, JL = 5.7 mA cm−2) comparable to the commercial Pt/C in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), excellent resistance to methanol toxicity and stability. Meanwhile, the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was 324 mV, close to that of commercial RuO2 catalysts (351 mV). This study utilizes the coordination action of lignosulfonate to provide a novel and environmentally friendly method for the preparation of confined nano-catalysts and provides a new perspective for the high-value utilization of biomass resources.

Monometallic nickel–organic frameworks based on a carboxylated ligand [2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (Ni-NDC)] have abundant and uniformly distributed single-atom Ni sites, enabling superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. In theory, most of the Ni atoms inside Ni-NDC microcrystals are coordinatively saturated except for the surface. Therefore, there are no accessible low-coordination atoms (LCAs) as electrocatalytic sites for the OER. One effective way is to expose more LCAs by preparing self-supporting Ni-NDC nanoarrays (Ni-NDC NAs) with hierarchical secondary structural units. Another effective method is to create more internal LCAs by removing partial ligands or coordination atoms attached to the Ni atoms. Herein, by combining the two strategies, we engineered LCAs in the interior and exterior of Ni-NDC to synergistically accelerate the OER. In brief, ultrathick "brick-like" Ni-NDC NAs were first prepared with dissolution and coordination effects of NDC on self-sacrificial templates of "agaric-like" nickel hydroxide nanoarrays [Ni(OH)2 NAs]. Subsequently, dual-coordinated NDC was partially replaced by monocoordinated 2-naphthoic acid (NA). The Ni-NDC NAs were further tailed into ultrathin "liner leaf-like" nanoneedle arrays (LCAs-Ni-NDC NAs). As a consequence, the LCAs-Ni-NDC NAs have more internal and external LCAs, which can deliver an OER performance that is superior to that of Ni-NDC NAs.

Abstract The path to searching for sustainable energy has never stopped since the depletion of fossil fuels can lead to serious environmental pollution and energy shortages. Using water electrolysis to produce hydrogen has been proven to be a prioritized approach for green resource production. It is highly crucial to explore inexpensive and high‐performance electrocatalysts for accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and apply them to industrial cases on a large scale. Here, we summarize the different mechanisms of HER in different pH settings and review recent advances in non‐noble‐metal‐based electrocatalysts. Then, based on the previous efforts, we discuss several universal strategies for designing pH‐independent catalysts and show directions for the future design of pH‐universal catalysts.

Abstract A promising strategy to boost electrocatalytic performance is via assembly of hetero‐nanostructured electrocatalysts that delivers the essential specific surface area and also active sites by lowering the reaction barrier. However, the challenges associated with the intricate designs and mechanisms remain underexplored. Therefore, the present study constructs a p–n junction in a free‐standing MnCo 2 O 4.5 @Ni 3 S 2 on Ni‐Foam. The space‐charge region's electrical characteristics is dramatically altered by the formed p–n junction, which enhances the electron transfer process for urea‐assisted electrocatalytic water splitting (UOR). The optimal MnCo 2 O 4.5 @Ni 3 S 2 electrocatalyst results in greater oxygen evolution reactivity (OER) than pure systems, delivering an overpotential of only 240 mV. Remarkably, upon employing as UOR electrode the required potential decreases to 30 mV. The impressive performance of the designed catalyst is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity, greater number of electrochemical active sites, and improved redox activity due to the junction interface formed between p‐MnCo 2 O 4.5 and n‐Ni 3 S 2 . There are strong indications that the in situ formed extreme‐surface NiOOH, starting from Ni 3 S 2, boosts the electrocatalytic activity, i.e., the electrochemical surface reconstruction generates the active species. In conclusion, this work presents a high‐performance p–n junction design for broad use, together with a viable and affordable UOR electrocatalyst.

The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to generate high‐value products is considered to be a promising approach to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. However, the pure CO2 gas is generally required in the most of the reported CO2RR system, which brings tedious capture and separation procedures and high cost. The utilization of realistic CO2 emission directly such as flue gas for the CO2RR is highly desirable. However, the gas impurities in the real CO2 sources such as oxygen could seriously affect the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR. This concept summarizes the recently reported works about CO2RR studies in the presence of O2 and highlights the physical and chemical strategies to boost CO2 electroreduction performance. We further discuss the implications of these strategies for future progress in this emerging field.

Abstract Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were sandwiched into interlayers between ZIF‐8 and ZIF‐67 to form ZIF‐Co 3 O 4 @ZIF precursors. Pyrolysis of ZIF‐Co 3 O 4 @ZIF yielded an urchin‐like hierarchically porous carbon (Co@CNT/NC), the thorns of which were carbon nanotubes embedded Co nanoparticles. With large specific surface area and hierarchically porous structure, as‐prepared Co@CNT/NC exhibited excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performances. It has good ORR performance with E 1/2 of 0.85 V, which exceeds the Pt/C half‐wave potential (E 1/2 =0.83 V). In addition, Co@CNT/NC has an OER performance close to that of RuO 2 . To further demonstrate the effect of Co modifying on the properties, the samples were subjected to acid washing treatment. Co‐based nanoparticles were proved to After acid washing, there was obvious loss of Co particles in Co@CNT/NC, resulting in poor oxygen electrocatalysis. So, the pyrolysis products of ZIF‐8‐Co 3 O 4 @ZIF‐67 retained large specific surface area and porous structure can be retained, and on the other hand, the carbon tube structure and original polyhedron framework. Besides, existence of Co nanoparticle@carbon nanotube provided more active sites and improved the ORR and OER performances.

Abstract Precisely modulating the Ru-O covalency in RuO x for enhanced stability in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is highly desired. However, transition metals with d -valence electrons, which were doped into or alloyed with RuO x , are inherently susceptible to the influence of coordination environment, making it challenging to modulate the Ru-O covalency in a precise and continuous manner. Here, we first deduce that the introduction of lanthanide with gradually changing electronic configurations can continuously modulate the Ru-O covalency owing to the shielding effect of 5 s /5 p orbitals. Theoretical calculations confirm that the durability of Ln-RuO x following a volcanic trend as a function of Ru-O covalency. Among various Ln-RuO x , Er-RuO x is identified as the optimal catalyst and possesses a stability 35.5 times higher than that of RuO 2 . Particularly, the Er-RuO x -based device requires only 1.837 V to reach 3 A cm −2 and shows a long-term stability at 500 mA cm −2 for 100 h with a degradation rate of mere 37 μV h −1 .

Reducing iridium (Ir) catalyst loading for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical strategy for large-scale hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. However, simultaneously achieving high activity, long-term stability, and reduced material cost remains challenging. To address this challenge, we develop a framework by combining density functional theory (DFT) prediction using model surfaces and proof-of-concept experimental verification using thin films and nanoparticles. DFT results predict that oxidized Ir monolayers over titanium nitride (IrO

Abstract The cycling stability of LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 under high voltages is hindered by the occurrence of hybrid anion‐ and cation‐redox processes, leading to oxygen escape and uncontrolled phase collapse. In this study, we propose an interfacial engineering strategy involving a straightforward mechanical ball milling and low‐temperature calcination, employing a Se‐doped and FeSe 2 &Fe 2 O 3 ‐modified approach to design a stable Ni‐rich cathode. Se 2− are selectively adsorbed within oxygen vacancies to form O‐TM‐Se bond, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen, and preventing structural distortion. Simultaneously, the Se‐NCM811//FeSe 2 //Fe 2 O 3 self‐assembled electric field is activated, improving interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, FeSe 2 accelerates Li + diffusion and reacts with oxygen to form Fe 2 O 3 and SeO 2 . The Fe 2 O 3 coating mitigates HF erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, limiting the outward migration of oxygen anions. Impressively, the modified materials exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 79.7% after 500 cycles at 1C under 4.5 V. Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 94.6% in 3 – 4.25 V after 550 cycles in pouch‐type full battery. This dual‐modification approach demonstrates its feasibility and opens new perspectives for the development of stable lithium‐ion batteries operating at high voltages.

Abstract Technically viable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) must be both active and stable under the harsh conditions at an electrolyser anode. While numerous highly active metal‐oxide catalysts have been identified, only very few are sufficiently stable, with iridium oxides being the most prominent. In this perspective, we draw insights from OER mechanisms to circumvent the activity‐stability conundrum generally plaguing the development of OER catalysts. In the commonly considered OER mechanisms, one or several metal‐oxygen (M−O) bonds are required to be broken along the OER pathway, providing a mechanistic link between the OER and oxide decomposition. However, a recently discovered mechanism on crystalline iridium dioxide provides a new OER pathway without M−O bond breakages, thus enabling the combination of sufficient activity and stability.

Using renewable steam-exploded poplar (SEP) as carbon source, nickel metal doped carbon hybrid materials were designed to synthesize catalysts (Ni/SEP) with certain oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties and were compared with nickel catalysts supported on metal organic framework structure (ZIF67-Ni). The roles of SEP support in Ni-based catalyst were considered. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images confirmed that the fiber could better hinder the aggregation of metal particles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) indicated the presence of surface OH groups after the reduction process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the major form of metallic Ni in the resulting Ni catalysts. Carbon materials as carriers, the synergetic effect of Ni-doped, and carbon carrier played an important role in facilitating the kinetics of OER, which was similar to the carrier of metal-organic frame material. Notably, the Ni/SEP (11.3 mF/cm-2) and ZIF67-Ni (37.2 mF/cm-2) with better OER performance exhibited a smaller double layer capacitances (Cdl), suggesting the intrinsic OER catalytic activity of the Ni/SEP and ZIF67-Ni were much higher in comparison to the ZIF67-Ni/SEP. Moreover, the inferior performance of Ni/SEP further indicated that the synergistic effect between carbon and Ni/NiO contributes to the enhanced OER activity.

The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal‐organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni‐based MOFs. Through an artificial‐intelligence (AI) data‐mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d‐band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3‐5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in‐depth understanding of structure–activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni‐based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF‐based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.

Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor represents a promising approach to industrial‐level H2O2 production, while it is hampered by the lack of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts in acidic medium. Herein, we present a strategy for the specific oxygen functional group (OFG) regulation to promote the H2O2 selectivity up to 92% in acid on cobalt‐porphyrin molecular assembled with reduced graphene oxide. In‐situ X‐ray adsorption spectroscopy, in‐situ Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy combined with theoretical calculation unravel that different OFGs exert distinctive regulation effects on the electronic structure of Co center through either remote (carboxyl and epoxy) or vicinal (hydroxyl) interaction manners, thus leading to the opposite influences on the promotion in 2e‐ ORR selectivity. As a consequence, the PEM electrolyzer integrated with the optimized catalyst can continuously and stably produce the high‐concentration of ca. 7 wt% pure H2O2 aqueous solution at 400 mA cm‐2 over 200 h with a cell voltage as low as ca. 2.1 V, suggesting the application potential in industrial‐scale H2O2 electrosynthesis.

Ni‐rich cathodes have been intensively adopted in Li‐ion batteries to pursuit high energy density, which still suffering irreversible degradation at high voltage. Some unstable lattice O2‐ species in Ni‐rich cathodes would be oxidized to singlet oxygen 1O2 and released at high volt, which lead to irreversible phase transfer from the layered rhombohedral (R) phase to a spinel‐like (S) phase. To overcome the issue, the amphiphilic copolymers (UMA‐Fx) electrolyte were prepared by linking hydrophobic C‐F side chains with hydrophilic subunits, which could self‐assemble on Ni‐rich cathode surface and convert to stable cathode–electrolyte interphase layer. Thereafter, the oxygen releasing of polymer coated cathode was obviously depressed and substituted by the Co oxidation (Co3+→Co4+) at high volt (>4.2V), which could suppressed irreversible phase transfer and improve cycling stability. Moreover, the amphiphilic polymer electrolyte was also stable with Li anode and had high ion conductivity. Therefore, the NCM811//UMA‐F6//Li pouch cell exhibited outstanding energy density (362.97 Wh/kg) and durability (cycled 200 times at 4.7V), which could be stalely cycled even at 120℃ without short circuits or explosions.

The generation of clean, zero-carbon, and renewable energy is a challenge for the development of a sustainable and egalitarian society. Hydrogen gas can be produced by water electrolysis and has been claimed as the most promising option to replace fossil fuels. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most energetically demanding step of the water splitting and requires the use of electrocatalysts to overcome the kinetic barrier. Iron oxide nanomaterials have been emerging as a low-cost and Earth-abundant OER electrocatalysts. The synthesis of iron oxide assisted by plant extract is an eco-friendly approach to obtain nanomaterials with unique properties. Herein, we investigated iron oxide synthesized with the assistance of Camellia sinensis extract, under different experimental conditions towards oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. Pure phases of iron oxide were obtained, ferrihydrite and maghemite showed overpotentials of 460 and 480 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 , respectively. After calcination, hematite was formed and the overpotential was raised to 610 and 810 mV, respectively. The lower overpotential of the amorphous materials could be related to the lower electron transfer resistance and faster reaction rate. On the other hand, the calcinated materials presented higher specific activity, stability and higher Faradaic efficiency.

The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal‐organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni‐based MOFs. Through an artificial‐intelligence (AI) data‐mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d‐band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3‐5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in‐depth understanding of structure–activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni‐based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF‐based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.

Abstract Earth‐abundant metal oxides are usually considered as stable but catalytically inert towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their unfavorable hydrogen intermediate adsorption performance. Herein, a heavy rare earth (Y) and transition metal (Co) dual‐doping induced lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy is proposed to boost CeO 2 towards robust alkaline HER. The induced lattice compression and increased oxygen vacancy (O v ) concentration in CeO 2 synergistically improve the water dissociation on O v and sequential hydrogen adsorption at activated O v ‐neighboring sites, leading to significantly enhanced HER kinetics. Meanwhile, Y doping offers stabilization effect on O v by its stronger Y−O bonding over Ce−O, which endows the catalyst with excellent stability. The Y,Co‐CeO 2 electrocatalyst exhibits an ultra‐low HER overpotential (27 mV at 10 mA cm −2 ) and Tafel slope (48 mV dec −1 ), outperforming the benchmark Pt electrocatalyst. Moreover, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporated with Y,Co‐CeO 2 achieves excellent stability of 500 h under 600 mA cm −2 . This synergistic lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy sheds new light on the rational development of efficient and stable oxide‐based HER electrocatalysts.

Abstract The development of bifunctional catalysts with subtle structures, high efficiencies and good durabilities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for overall water splitting. In this work, a multicomponent S-doped NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe micronano flower electrocatalyst was synthesized rapidly on foam copper using a simple one-step constant current electrodeposition method. The introduction of S leads to the transformation of the microsphere structure of the Ni-Fe alloy into a cauliflower-like morphology and induces changes in the surface electronic structure, significantly enhancing the catalytic performance for the HER and OER. The S-NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe alloy/CF showed low overpotentials of 220 mV and 66 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH for the OER and HER, respectively. High durability OER and HER performances were demonstrated through 60 h of chronopotentiometry and 6000 CV cycles test. Excellent overall water splitting electrocatalytic activity was observed in the S-NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe alloy/CF‖S-NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe alloy/CF two-electrode system. In particular, active-phase NiOOH, a highly active substance for OER, can be controllably formed in the reaction process owing to the nanoflower structure of multi-layer sulfur which slows down the dissolution of NiFe2O4/Ni-Fe alloy. These results suggest that this composite structure is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst.&#xD;

Electrocatalytic water splitting driven by sustainable energy is a clean and promising water-chemical fuel conversion technology for the production of high purity green hydrogen. However, the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pose challenges for large-scale hydrogen production, limiting its efficiency and safety. Recently, the anodic OER has been replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with biomass as the substrate and coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has attracted great interest. Anode NOR offers faster kinetics, generates high-value products, and reduces energy consumption. By coupling NOR with hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production efficiency can be enhanced while yielding high-value oxidation products or degrading pollutants. Therefore, NOR-coupled HER hydrogen production is another new green electrolytic hydrogen production strategy after electrolytic water hydrogen production, which is of great significance for realizing sustainable energy development and global decarbonization. This review explores the potential of nucleophilic oxidation reactions as an alternative to OER and delves into NOR mechanisms, guiding future research in NOR-coupled hydrogen production. It assesses different NOR-coupled production methods, analyzing reaction pathways and catalyst effects. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of electrolyzers in industrialized NOR-coupled hydrogen production and discusses future prospects and challenges. This comprehensive review aims to advance efficient and economical large-scale hydrogen production. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is critical for direct hydrazine fuel cells and presents a promising alternative to the kinetics-sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in water splitting. Engineering catalysts with high-density nanotwin structures has emerged as a compelling strategy to enhance catalytic activity. However, such catalysts have to be explored for HzOR applications. This work reports the successful synthesis of a porous Ni–Zn catalyst featuring high-density coherent nanotwins (NT-Ni-Zn). NT-Ni-Zn supported on Ni foam exhibited exceptionally high catalytic activity and stability toward the HzOR, achieving a current density of 212.4 mA·cm–2 at 0.04 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode and retaining up to 93.9% after 15 h of continuous electrolysis. In addition, hydrazine-assisted water electrolysis using NT-Ni-Zn/Ni foam as both the cathode and anode require only a cell voltage of 70 mV to reach 10 mA cm–2. The exceptional HzOR activity of the Ni–Zn catalyst is attributed to the presence of the nanotwin structure, which promotes a favorable d-band center position and facilitates strong hydrazine binding on the twinned surface. This study provides valuable insights into the development of nanotwin catalysts for HzOR advancement.

We have demonstrated a single‐crystal‐to‐single‐crystal (SCSC) transformation from a two‐dimensional noninterpenetrated layer to a microporous three‐dimensional fourfold interpenetrated MOF. The centrosymmetric [Co 2 (μ 2 ‐OH)(EIBA) 3 ] n ( SNUT‐25 ) transforms into a microporous [Co(EIBA) 2 ] n ( SNUT‐26 ), which is triggered by the reaction time with DMF that acts as a structure‐directing agent (HEIBA = 4‐(2‐ethyl‐1H‐imidazol‐1‐yl)benzoic acid; DMF = N,N′‐dimethylformamide). Despite the distinct structure and coordination arrangements of SNUT‐25 in contrast to SNUT‐26 , both Co‐MOFs were synthesized using the same ligand. Fascinatingly, upon introducing a specific quantity of DMF combined with a negligible proportion of nitric acid, SNUT‐25 will progressively and completely transform into SNUT‐26 . Under the synergistic induction of solvent molecules and temperature, SNUT‐25 changed from the original two‐dimensional layered structure to the three‐dimensional pore structure of SNUT‐26 . In addition, SNUT‐25 and SNUT‐26 are efficient photocatalysts for the degradation of organic dye methyl blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. Surprisingly, the degradation rates of both SNUT‐25 and SNUT‐26 can reach over 96%. In addition, SNUT‐25 and SNUT‐26 also exhibited high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.

The search for new materials can be laborious and expensive. Given the challenges that mankind faces today concerning the climate change crisis, the need to accelerate materials discovery for applications like water-splitting could be very relevant for a renewable economy. In this work, we introduce a computational framework to predict the activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, in order to accelerate the discovery of materials that can facilitate water splitting. We use this framework to screen 6155 ternary-phase spinel oxides and have isolated 33 candidates which are predicted to have potentially high OER activity. We have also trained a machine learning model to predict the binding energies of the *O, *OH and *OOH intermediates calculated within this workflow to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between electronic structure descriptors and OER activity. Out of the 33 candidates predicted to have high OER activity, we have synthesized three compounds and characterized them using linear sweep voltammetry to gauge their performance in OER. From these three catalyst materials, we have identified a new material, Co2.5Ga0.5O4, that is competitive with benchmark OER catalysts in the literature with a low overpotential of 220mV at 10mAcm-2 and a Tafel slope at 56.0 mV dec-1. Given the vast size of chemical space as well as the success of this technique to date, we believe that further application of this computational framework based on the high-throughput virtual screening of materials can lead to the discovery of additional novel, high-performing OER catalysts.

Abstract The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) is of significance in regards of environmentally friendly issues and green ammonia production. However, relatively low performance with a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a challenge to overcome for the NO 3 RR. In this study, oxygen vacancy‐controlled copper oxide (CuO x ) catalysts through a plasma treatment are successfully prepared and supported on high surface area porous carbon that are co‐doped with N, Se species for its enhanced electrochemical properties. The oxygen vacancy‐increased CuO x catalyst supported on the N,Se co‐doped porous carbon (CuO x ‐H/NSePC) exhibited the highest NO 3 RR performance with faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87.2% and yield of 7.9 mg cm −2 h −1 for the ammonia production, representing significant enhancements of FE and ammonia yield as compared to the un‐doped or the oxygen vacancy‐decreased catalysts. This high performance should be attributed to a significant increase in the catalytic active sites with facilitated energetics from strategies of doping the catalytic materials and weakening the N─O bonding strength for the adsorption of NO 3 − ions on the modulated oxygen vacancies. This results show a promise that co‐doping of heteroatoms and regulating of oxygen vacancies can be key factors for performance enhancement, suggesting new guidelines for effective catalyst design of NO 3 RR.

Manganese, a 3d transition metal, with variable oxidation states(-3 to +7) is ubiquitous in earth’s crust, has low toxicity, and as a catalyst in cyanobacterial photosynthesis accumulated oxygen in the ocean which gradually escaped into the atmosphere displacing methane sometime between 2.4 – 2.1 billion years ago1. Cyanobacteria evolved from an anaerobic environment to produce oxygen which wiped out much of anaerobic life and gave rise to aerobic metabolism. Manganese thus plays a central role in evolution. Biophysical and biochemical studies of manganese as biocatalysts is described from a chemical and biological perspective in this chapter. The dissertation work done by the author dictates the choices in this chapter that are thus more like vignettes considering the vast amount of ongoing work in the area of Manganese bio catalysis. Manganese as a catalyst that produces hydrogen from water might turn out to be the key to a carbon neutral green economy of the future.

Using density functional theory (DFT), this work explores barium zirconate doped with nitrogen. In addition, we used density functional theory (DFT) to study the BaZrO$_3$'s electrical, optical, and structural properties, and we found that the BaZrO$_3$ has intrinsic vacancy defects by employing the supercell approach. Integrating testability into hardware devices is the goal of testing design, an approach to integrated circuit design that draws on density functional theory. This technology simplifies production testing and implementation. The study strategy incorporates the following methods: LSDA+U, Exchange Correlation Approximations, Hohenberg Kohn Theorem, and Local Spin Density Approximation. We tracked the evolution of barium zirconate's protonic, nitrogen ionic, and electronic conductivities using Density Functional Theory (DFT). We found low electrical conductivity despite the fact that nitrogen doping successfully lowered energy barriers for oxygen and proton ion migration. The conductivity of barium zirconate increased in proportion to the supercell's nitrogen content. Furthermore, we investigated the local arrangements of octahedral sites in Pm3m cubic frameworks and utilized Density Functional Theory to dope BaZrO$_3$. Nitrogen doping caused a lot of changes to oxygen sites, revealing three groups of oxygen atoms with different structural properties.

Abstract JWST observations of the seven-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will provide an excellent opportunity to test outcomes of stellar-driven evolution of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, including atmospheric escape, ocean loss, and abiotic oxygen production. While most previous studies use a single luminosity evolution for the host star, we incorporate observational uncertainties in stellar mass, luminosity evolution, system age, and planetary parameters to statistically explore the plausible range of planetary atmospheric escape outcomes. We present probabilistic distributions of total water loss and oxygen production as a function of initial water content, for planets with initially pure water atmospheres and no interior–atmosphere exchange. We find that the interior planets are desiccated for initial water contents below 50 Earth oceans. For TRAPPIST-1e, f, g, and h, we report maximum water-loss ranges of    8.0   − 0.9   + 1.3    ,    4.8   − 0.4   + 0.6    ,    3.4   − 0.3   + 0.3    , and    0.8   − 0.1   + 0.2    Earth oceans, respectively, with corresponding maximum oxygen retention of    1290   − 75   + 75    ,    800   − 40   + 40    ,    560   − 25   + 30    , and    90   − 10   + 10    bars. We explore statistical constraints on initial water content imposed by current water content, which could inform evolutionary history and planet formation. If TRAPPIST-1b is airless while TRAPPIST-1c possesses a tenuous oxygen atmosphere, as initial JWST observations suggest, then our models predict an initial surface water content of 8.2     − 1.0   + 1.5    Earth oceans for these worlds, leading to the outer planets retaining >1.5 Earth oceans after entering the habitable zone. Even if TRAPPIST-1c is airless, surface water on the outer planets would not be precluded.

Photocatalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are typically constructed with rigid aromatic linkers for crystallinity and extended π-conjugation. However, the essential hydrophobicity of the aromatic backbone can limit their performances in water-based photocatalytic reactions. Here, we for the first time report the synthesis of hydrophilic COFs with aliphatic linkers [tartaric acid dihydrazide (TAH) and butanedioic acid dihydrazide] that can function as efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 and H2 evolution. In these hydrophilic aliphatic linkers, the specific multiple hydrogen bonding networks not only enhance crystallization but also ensure an ideal compatibility of crystallinity, hydrophilicity, and light harvesting. The resulting aliphatic linker COFs adopt an unusual ABC stacking, giving rise to approximately 0.6 nm nanopores with an improved interaction with water guests. Remarkably, both aliphatic linker-based COFs show strong visible light absorption, along with a narrow optical band gap of ∼1.9 eV. The H2O2 evolution rate for TAH-COF reaches up to 6003 μmol h–1 g–1, in the absence of sacrificial agents, surpassing the performance of all previously reported COF-based photocatalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the TAH linker can enhance the indirect two-electron oxygen reduction reaction for H2O2 production by improving the O2 adsorption and stabilizing the *OOH intermediate. This study opens a new avenue for constructing semiconducting COFs using nonaromatic linkers.    

    

## Magnetic field evolution for crystallization-driven dynamos in C/O white

We investigate the evolution of magnetic fields generated by the crystallization-driven dynamo in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) with masses $\lesssim1.05\ M_{\odot}$. We use scalings for the dynamo to demonstrate that the initial magnetic field strength ($B_{0}$) has an upper limit that depends on the initial convection zone size ($R_{\mathrm{out},0}$) and the WD mass. We solve the induction equation to follow the magnetic field evolution after the dynamo phase ends. We show that the predicted surface magnetic field strength ($B_{\mathrm{surf}}$) differs from $B_{0}$ by at least a factor of $\sim$0.3. This reduction depends on $R_{\mathrm{out},0}$, where values smaller than half of the star radius give $B_{\mathrm{surf}}\lesssim0.01\ B_{0}$. We implement electrical conductivities that account for the solid phase effect on the Ohmic diffusion. We observe that the conductivity increases as the solid core grows, freezing in the magnetic field at a certain point of the evolution and slowing its outwards transport. We study the effect of turbulent magnetic diffusivity induced by the convection and find that for a small $R_{\mathrm{out},0}$, $B_{\mathrm{surf}}$ is stronger than the non-turbulent diffusion cases because of the more rapid transport, but still orders of magnitude smaller than $B_{0}$. Given these limitations, the crystallization-driven dynamo theory could explain only magnetic C/O WDs with field strengths less than a few MG for the mass range 0.45-1.05 $M_{\odot}$. Our results also suggest that a buried fossil field must be at least 100 times stronger than observed surface fields if crystallization-driven convection is responsible for its transport to the surface.

EPAS1HIF2a is the primary gene implicated in systemic hypoxia adaptation. Conversely, aberrantly activated EPAS1HIF2a acts as a tumor driver against which anti-tumor therapeutics are proven effective. We elucidated connections between adaptation to systemic hypoxia in high-altitude populations, such as Tibetans and Sherpas, and human tumors. Similar to the accelerated adaptability observed in high-altitude populations via genetic introgression, tumors from patients with hypoxia since birth exhibited impaired DNA repair and increased mutation burden. As in high-altitude dwellers, EPAS1HIF2a genetic variants were positively selected within sympathetic tumors developed under hypoxia, with a consistently high frequency of 90%. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing followed by in vitro studies have shown that hypoxia and EPAS1HIF2a gain-of-function tumor mutations induce COX4i2 expression and impair mitochondrial respiration, indicating that decreased cellular oxygen consumption may confer a proliferative advantage in hypoxia. Analyzing medical data from a patient cohort with hypoxia since birth who developed/did not develop tumors revealed tissue-specific and time-dependent tumorigenic effects of systemic hypoxia, which is limited to oxygen-sensitive and responsive cells, particularly during the postnatal period. This study supports connections between the EPAS1HIF2a genetic adaptation in human tumors developed under systemic hypoxia to populations living in high altitudes. The genetic adaptations in populations to different stressors can be explored further to understand tumorigenesis and tumor evolution.

Abstract Complex multi-element alloys are gaining prominence for structural applications, supplementing steels, and superalloys. Understanding the impact of each element on alloy surfaces due to oxidation is vital in maintaining material integrity. This study investigates oxidation mechanisms in these alloys using a model five-element equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn alloy, in a controlled oxygen environment. The oxidation-induced surface changes correlate with each element’s interactive tendencies with the environment, guided by thermodynamics. Initial oxidation stages follow atomic size and redox potential, with the latter becoming dominant over time, causing composition inversion. The study employs in-situ atom probe tomography, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure techniques to elucidate the oxidation process and surface oxide structure evolution. Our findings deconvolute the mechanism for compositional and structural changes in the oxide film and will pave the way for a predictive design of complex alloys with improved resistance to oxidation under extreme conditions.

Abstract This article describes a novel dataset on non‐diamondiferous eclogite and garnet pyroxenite xenoliths from four kimberlite pipes of the Ekati Diamond Mine (Central Slave Craton, Canada). Xenoliths brought to the surface by kimberlite eruptions are direct sources of information on the composition and evolution of the Earth's mantle. Eclogite and garnet pyroxenite xenoliths, specifically, are testimony of subduction into, and metasomatism of, the mantle beneath cratons. Furthermore, these rocks are major hosts for diamond and thus an important part of the deep carbon cycle. The sample suite consists of 41 small xenoliths (2–5 cm) recovered from drill cores. The dataset includes major and trace element concentrations for garnet, clinopyroxene and ilmenite, as well as stable oxygen isotope compositions of garnets. Strontium and neodymium isotopic compositions are reported for garnet and clinopyroxene for four samples which were large enough to allow for analysis. Overall, this dataset significantly expands and complements existing datasets on diamondiferous and non‐diamondiferous xenoliths from the Slave Craton in Canada, furthering our understanding of the composition of the Slave subcratonic lithosphere. The dataset includes several samples with rare mineral assemblages, including an olivine‐bearing eclogite as well as ilmenite and apatite‐bearing garnet‐pyroxenites, and thus provides data shedding light on rarely reported compositional nuances in xenolith suites found in kimberlites.

Abstract Proton exchange‐membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a clean and efficient type of energy storage device. However, the sluggish reaction rate of the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been a significant problem in its development. This review reports the recent progress of advanced electrocatalysts focusing on the interface/surface electronic structure and exploring the synergistic relationship of precious‐based and non‐precious metal‐based catalysts and support materials. The support materials contain non‐metal (C/N/Si, etc.) and metal‐based structures, which have demonstrated a crucial role in the synergistic enhancement of electrocatalytic properties, especially for high‐temperature fuel cell systems. To improve the strong interaction, some exciting synergistic strategies by doping and coating heterogeneous elements or connecting polymeric ligands containing carbon and nitrogen were also shown herein. Besides the typical role of the crystal surface, phase structure, lattice strain, etc., the evolution of structure‐performance relations was also highlighted in real‐time tests. The advanced in situ characterization techniques were also reviewed to emphasize the accurate structure‐performance relations. Finally, the challenge and prospect for developing the ORR electrocatalysts were concluded for commercial applications in low‐ and high‐temperature fuel cell systems.

The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g‐C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z‐scheme photocatalyst through self‐assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g‐C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z‐scheme heterojunction formation between g‐C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z‐scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco‐benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.

Optimizing electrosynthetic reactions requires fine tuning of a vast chemical space, including charge transfer at electrocatalyst/electrode surfaces, engineering of mass transport limitations, and complex interactions of reactants and products with their environment. Hybrid electrolytes, in which supporting salt ions and substrates are dissolved in a binary mixture of organic solvent and water, represent a new piece of this complex puzzle as they offer a unique opportunity to harness water as the oxygen or proton source in electrosynthesis. In this work, we demonstrate that modulating water-organic solvent interactions drastically impacts the solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes. Combining various spectroscopies with synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the size and composition of aqueous domains forming in hybrid electrolytes can be controlled. We demonstrate that water is more reactive for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous domains than when strongly interacting with solvent molecules, which originates from a change in reaction kinetics rather than a thermodynamic effect. We exemplify novel opportunities arising from this new knowledge for optimizing electrosynthetic reactions in hybrid electrolytes. For reactions proceeding first via the activation of water, fine tuning of aqueous domains impacts the kinetics and potentially the selectivity of the reaction. Instead, for organic substrates reacting prior to water, aqueous domains have no impact on the reaction kinetics, while selectivity may be affected. We believe that such a fine comprehension of solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes can be transposed to numerous electrosynthetic reactions.

Abstract. Within the oligotrophic subtropical oceans, summertime DIC drawdown despite nutrient limitation in surface waters and subsurface oxygen consumption in the absence of Redfieldian stoichiometric nitrate release are two phenomena still awaiting a full mechanistic characterization. The distribution, intensity and seasonality of these phenomena are identified with preformed nitrate as a tracer, where negative preformed nitrate (NPN) anomalies below the euphotic zone correspond to oxygen consumption without Redfieldian NO3- release, and positive performed nitrate (PPN) anomalies found within the upper 100 m occur where O2 is produced without stoichiometric NO3- drawdown. Many processes that may contribute to these anomalies including N2 fixation, non-Redfieldian DOM cycling, vertically migrating phytoplankton, heterotrophic NO3- uptake and vertical NO3- injection events have been measured or modelled, yet generally cannot fully account for the magnitudes of preformed nitrate anomalies and excess DIC drawdown observed in many oligotrophic subtropical waters. One other candidate process that may contribute to both phenomena is the formation of carbon-rich transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie-stainable particles (CSP) from dissolved organic precursors in surface waters and their subsequent remineralization below the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). However, few data exist to quantify exopolymer production and vertical distributions in oligotrophic oceans over an annual cycle, which is necessary to understand their potential role in the evolution of seasonal preformed nitrate anomalies and DIC drawdown. To investigate the significance of exopolymer formation and export to North Pacific subtropical gyre biogeochemistry, we undertook a multi-year time-series (Jan 2020 – Sep 2022) analysis of TEP, CSP and total dissolved polysaccharides concentrations at Station ALOHA (22° 45’,158° W), and along a transect from 22° 45’ to 31° N to measure latitudinal variability in June 2021. Exopolymer C:N stoichiometry at Station ALOHA varied between 16.4 – 34.3, with values being more carbon-rich in summer; ratios were higher (32–38) toward the gyre centre at 31° N. TEP concentrations were consistently elevated in surface waters through Spring–Autumn (4–8 µM C after carbon conversion) at Station ALOHA with lower concentrations (~1.5–3 µM C) and more uniform vertical distribution during winter, indicating that TEP accumulated in surface waters may vertically sink and be exported with winter mixing. The accumulation of TEP in surface waters through Spring–Autumn and its subsequent export may account for 6.5–20 % of net community production (NCP), helping reduce the estimated imbalance of N supply and N demand at this site to <10 %. The upper ocean TEP cycle may explain 22–67 % of the observed PPN/NPN anomalies, helping to close the C, N, and O2 budgets at station ALOHA, while leaving room for significant contributions from other processes such as vertically migrating phytoplankton and heterotrophic nitrate uptake to be further validated. These results suggest that exopolymer production and cycling may be more important to open ocean carbon biogeochemistry than previously expected, with considerable seasonality and spatial variability influenced by physical processes and phytoplankton activity.

Ongoing soil salinization has emerged as a major adverse environmental stress that globally threatens crop growth and productivity (Munns et al., 2020). As one of the most important cereal crops, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a glycophyte and hence often severely affected by salinity stress (Negrão et al., 2011). Developing salt tolerant rice cultivars by exploiting more genetic salt tolerant resources will greatly contribute to global food security. Presence–absence variations (PAVs), referring to the presence or absence of gene variability in diverse rice accessions, are an important source of genetic diversity and have been revealed to play key roles in the determination of plant evolution and agronomical traits (Della Coletta et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023). However, it remains unclear how they modulate stress response, especially salt stress. Currently, with the availability of rice pan-genomic data, PAVs can be systematically identified and described, enabling in-depth exploration of their roles in rice genetic diversity and salt stress response. The expression of genes can be altered by nearby PAV due to their interruptions in gene or regulatory elements (Scott et al., 2021). Several eQTLs associated with salt tolerance have been identified using a set of SNPs generated from the super pan-genome of rice (Wei et al., 2024). Additionally, PAVs known as hidden variants have the ability to reveal new eQTLs that cannot be detected by SNPs (Shang et al., 2022). To discover PAVs affecting gene expression under normal and salt stress conditions, we identified PAV associated with gene expression levels (PAV-expression quantitative loci, PAV-eQTLs) among the Global MiniCore Rice Collection of 202 accessions that have been published previously (Shang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2024). We defined the PAV located in the c. 2 kb as cis-eQTL and identified 2427 and 2898 cis-PAV-eGenes under normal and salt stress conditions, respectively. Based on occurrence in different conditions, 1692 belonged to static PAV-eGenes and 1206 eGenes pertained dynamic PAV-eGene only under salt stress environment (Fig. 1a, upper panel). Given the crucial role of transcription factors (TFs) involved in salt stress response, we focused on 22 members that overlapped with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and dynamic PAV-eGenes under the salt stress condition and TF dataset, of which these data were sourced from PlantTFDB (Fig. 1a, lower panel; Supporting Information Table S1). Through examination of a Manhattan plot of PAV-eQTL c. 22 members, we found that 12 members have significant and unique association peaks (Fig. S1). The person correction of 22 genes between the Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) and survival rate under salt stress condition was further analyzed, and the result indicated that 12 members showed a significant correlation between the expression levels and the survival rate (Figs 1b, S2). Next, we found that seven candidate genes can simultaneously meet both of the above conditions (Fig. S3). Finally, we further analyzed the significant positions where PAVs fall and combined with the gene function, focusing on OsMADS56 (also named as GL10) that regulated heading date and grain size (Figs 1c, S3; Table S1). Among these significant PAVs of OsMADS56, we found that one PAV (Chr10_20,863489) resulted in the complete absence of both the ATG and first exon (Fig. 1d). Based on sequence variations of this PAVs across 202 rice accessions, they were classified into two haplotypes (Hap1 and Hap2) of OsMADS56 (Fig. 1d). The Hap1 containing 1.0 Kb PAV was detected in six salt-tolerant cultivars (Fig. S4). Furthermore, these accessions containing Hap1 had much higher survival rate and lower dead leaf rate than those with Hap2 after NaCl treatment (Fig. 1e, left and middle panel). Additionally, the FPKM values of Hap1 were significantly higher than Hap2 (Fig. 1e, right panel), indicating that this PAV disrupted the expression of OsMADS56 to cause more sensitivity to salt tolerance. To further reveal the genetic effect of this natural variation in OsMADS56 on salt tolerance, we obtained the near isogenic lines (NILs) of OsMADS56, NIL-GL10 and NIL-gl10, corresponding to Hap1 and Hap2, respectively (Zhan et al., 2022), and found that the survival rate of NIL-GL10 was obviously higher than that of NIL-gl10 under salt stress (Fig. 1f). Collectively, these results support the notion that OsMADS56 is likely to be crucial for salt tolerance in rice. We found that OsMADS56 was significantly induced when exposed to 150 mM NaCl and reached the peak at 6 h (Fig. S5a). Subsequently, the pOsMADS56::GUS transgenic seedlings were used to further verify the response to salt stress. In accordance with the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, the expression of OsMADS56 was enhanced after exposed to NaCl treatment for 1 h, peaked at 6 h, and then decreased (Fig. S5b). To confirm the function of OsMADS56 in salt stress, the loss-of-function osmads56 mutants mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 system and OsMADS56 overexpressing transgenic plants driven by the Ubiquitin promoter were obtained. We selected two T1 homozygous frame-shift osmads56 mutants (Cas9-72 and Cas9-73) and two independent overexpression lines with elevated OsMADS56 expression (OE-2 and OE-6) in XS134 background, as well as one T1 homozygous frame-shift mutant (Cas9-6) in ZH11 to further investigate their responses to 150 mM NaCl (Fig. S6). Compared with the wild-type (WT), OsMADS56 overexpressing lines exhibited several specific advantages under NaCl treatment, including higher seed germination rates during the germination stage (Figs 1g, S7), lesser inhibition effects on shoot length, root length, and fresh weight in the post-germination stage (Fig. S8), as well as higher survival rates at the four-leaf stage (Fig. 1h), suggesting that overexpression of OsMADS56 caused hyposensitivity to salt stress in rice. Nevertheless, osmads56 mutants from XS134 and ZH11 both exhibited much more severe salt stress-sensitive characteristics than their corresponding WT (Figs 1g,h, S7–S9). Furthermore, our RNA-seq data showed that the transcriptions of positively regulated genes for salt tolerance, such as SKC1 and OsSIK2, were drastically enhanced in overexpression lines under salt stress, compared with WT, which were notably reduced in the osmads56 mutants (Fig. S10). Together, these data indicated that OsMADS56 plays a positive regulatory role in rice salt tolerance. Emerging evidence suggests that salt stress-induced osmotic stress causes increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which in turn creates oxidative stress that results in physiological damage to plant cells (Castro et al., 2021). To detect the ROS accumulation, we compared 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) staining in osmads56 variants, OsMADS56 overexpression lines, and WT leaves. Without NaCl treatment, there was no noticeable difference between above plants. However, after being exposed to 150 mM NaCl treatment, the DAB and NBT staining results showed that more ROS accumulated in the osmads56 mutants, but less in the OsMADS56 overexpression lines, than in their corresponding WT (Fig. 1i). Since the ROS accumulation is related to the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes, we then measured the antioxidant enzyme activities, such as catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). As expected, all of the mentioned enzyme activities were increased under osmotic stress treatment; however, the enzyme activities of osmads56 mutants were clearly lower than those of WT, whereas the enzyme activities were evidently higher in the OsMADS56 OE plants than in the WT (Fig. 1i). Consequently, we speculated that the OsMADS56 gene could improve the salt stress tolerance through enhancing the activity of certain ROS-scavenging enzymes in rice. To investigate the genetic interactions between OsMADS56 and other salt tolerance genes, all 202 accessions from the pan-genomic population were classified by functional nucleotide polymorphisms (FNPs) of GS3, SKC1, STG5, and MKK10.2. Coincidentally, in the presence of OsMADS56, significant differences were observed in salt tolerance between the groups containing GS3/SKC1 and gs3/skc1, implying that OsMADS56 had an additive effect on salt tolerance for these genes (Fig. 1j). A similar additive effect of OsMADS56 also occurred on the STG5 and MKK10.2 genes in terms of salt tolerance (Fig. S11). These results indicate that different combinations of OsMADS56 and these genes' FNPs have significant effects on salt tolerance, suggesting their potential synergistic regulation of salt tolerance. In conclusion, we innovatively determined the effects of PAVs on salt stress response in rice and successfully identified a novel salt tolerance gene OsMADS56, suggesting that super pan-genome and transcriptomics technologies rendered an effective way to identify functional PAV-eQTLs in salinity tolerance. OsMADS56 overexpression lines reduced the accumulation of ROS by up-regulating ROS-scavenging enzyme activities, thereby enhancing the salt stress tolerance in rice. Our findings also provide insights into an alternative multi-gene aggregation strategy for salt tolerance, implying that OsMADS56 might be a promising genetic resource for developing salt tolerance rice cultivars. These discoveries are expected to contribute to rice production in the face of the continuous threat of salt stress. More critically, previous studies have revealed that OsMADS56 also contributes to grain size, thermotolerance, and photoperiodic flowering in rice (Ryu et al., 2009; Zhan et al., 2022; He et al., 2024). Thus, OsMADS56 provides a promising target for increasing productivity, stress tolerance, and adaptability of rice globally. The rice cultivar Xiushui134 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) was used as WT for physiological experiments and genetic transformation. The knockout mutants of OsMADS56 were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 system, and OsMADS56 overexpressing lines were driven by Ubiquitin promoter. The osmads56 mutant in Zhonghua11 (ZH11) background was purchased from the WIMI Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Changzhou, China) (Lu et al., 2017). Plants were grown in the growth chamber or glasshouse with a 14 h : 10 h, 30°C : 25°C, light : dark cycle (300 μmol photons m−2 s−1). Relative humidity was controlled at 60% humidity. The RNA-seq data and the DEGs dataset were collected from our previous studies (Shang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2024). The method of eQTL analysis was conducted in the same way as described in Wei et al. (2024). For PAV-eGene, eQTL with lead SNP located within 2 kb upstream and downstream of the gene were classified as cis, while the others were considered as trans. To analyze seed germination under salt treatment, roughly 90 seeds of osmads56 mutants, OsMADS56 overexpressing lines, and corresponding WT (three replicates per genotype) were randomly placed in ½-strength Murashige & Skoog medium (½ MS medium) supplemented with 150 mM NaCl. Seeds were considered to have germinated when the radicle or germ reaches a length of c. 1 mm. The germination rates were recorded daily. For phenotype analysis at post-germination, the uniformly germinated seeds were grown on ½ MS medium containing 150 mM NaCl at 28°C. Then, the shoot length, root length, and fresh weight were measured to assess the salt inhibition. For salinity stress testing, 15-d-old seedlings grown in ½ MS medium were treated with 150 mM NaCl solution for 3–5 d. After 7-d recovery, seedlings were photographed and the survival rate was determined. Seeds and seedlings grown in ½ MS medium were used as the control. For salt stress response by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the WT (XS134) was exposed to 150 mM NaCl, and the samples were, collected at different time points. Nitroblue tetrazolium staining and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining were used for detecting O2− and H2O2, respectively, as described previously (Zhang et al., 2014). The activities of CAT, APX, and SOD were determined as reported previously (Foyer & Noctor, 2005). To analyze the promoter activity of OsMADS56, a 3.5-kb region upstream of the translation start codon of OsMADS56 was cloned into pCXGUS-P vector (Chen et al., 2009) to create pOsMADS56::GUS construct. Then, the resulting construct was transformed into rice calli of XS134 by an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method (Hiei et al., 1994). Rice samples were incubated in GUS staining solution at 37°C in the dark for 12 h, and chlorophyll was removed using 75% ethanol. Sixteen-day-old seedlings were treated with 150 mM NaCl for 6 h, while seedlings without NaCl treatment were considered as a control. Whole plants were then sampled for RNA sequencing. TRIzol (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for extracting total RNA. For transcriptome analysis, cDNA libraries were constructed according to standard Illumina protocols and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system. Differentially expressed genes were defined as those with a twofold expression difference and a P-value < 0.05. The extracted RNA was reverse transcribed with First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed with the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) following the operation manual, and the rice OsActin1 gene was used as endogenous control. Data from three biological replicates and three technical repetitions were collected. A list of primers is shown in Table S2. We thank Prof. Shaokui Wang (South China Agricultural University, Guangdong) for kindly providing the near isogenic lines NIL-GL10 and NIL-gl10.
