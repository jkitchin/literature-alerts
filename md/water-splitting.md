Layered black phosphorus (BP) has unique electronic structure, which makes it an ideal candidate material for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Charge doping effectively improves the environmental stability and catalytic activity of BP by providing electron transfer channels and reducing the charge transfer barrier. Therefore, based on the method of first principles calculation, this paper theoretically discusses how the intrinsic charge doping without introducing impurities changes the electronic structure and improves the catalytic activity of BP. It is found that charge engineering can stimulate the hybridization between different P-p orbitals, effectively regulate and change the electronic structure and work function while maintaining the direct bandgap semiconductor characteristics of monolayer BP system. More importantly, in the catalytic process of OER, electrons and hole doping as free charges provide different donor and acceptor energy levels for the system depending on the doping concentration, and affect the adsorption capacity of monolayer BP to different reaction intermediates. When the doping concentration is 0.15 e/u.c, monolayer BP can achieves the optimal Gibbs free energy and overpotential, the rate-determining step of reaction free-energy diagram is downhill and exothermal, and carrier mobility is significantly increased. These results provide new opportunities and possibilities for designing charge-engineered BP catalysts with adjustable electronic structure and excellent OER activity.

The design of electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that perform effectively across a broad pH spectrum is paramount. The efficiency of hydrogen evolution at ruthenium (Ru) active sites, often hindered by the kinetics of water dissociation in alkaline or neutral conditions, requires further enhancement. Metal oxides, due to superior electron dynamics facilitated by oxygen vacancies (OVS) and shifts in the Fermi level, surpass carbon-based materials. In particular, tungsten oxide (WO3) promotes the directed migration of electrons and protons which significantly activates the Ru sites. Ru/WO3-OV is prepared through a simple hydrothermal and low-temperature annealing process. The prepared catalyst achieves 10 mA cm-2 at overpotentials of 23 mV (1 M KOH), 36 mV (0.5 M H2SO4), 62 mV (1 M PBS), and 38 mV (1 M KOH + seawater). At an overpotential corresponding to 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + seawater, the mass activity of Ru/WO3-OV is about 7.7 and 7.86 times that of 20 wt% Pt/C. The improvement in activity and stability arises from electronic modifications attributed to metal-support interaction. This work offers novel insights for modulating the HER activity of Ru sites across a wide pH range.

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions that make up the over water splitting reaction. Increasing oxygen evolution reaction rate wound immensely raise the efficiency of over water splitting reaction because it is the rate limiting reaction in water splitting reaction. The key to improve OER performance is the development and utilization of advanced catalysts. As one of the most potential catalysts for HER, it has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in the aspect of catalytic OER. It is very necessary to review the research progress of Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in catalytic OER to promote the research process in the field. In this review, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER. First of all, structural regulation of TMDs-based electrocatalyst was summarized in detail, mainly including size engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, phase engineering and heterojunction engineering. Once more, magnetic field regulation as a representative of external field regulation to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER performance was discussed in depth. Last but not least, the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER is prospected and some views on the development of this field are also put forward, which are expected to enhance the catalytic efficiency of TMDs for OER.

Developing high-active and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is very important in the field of water splitting. The catalytic performance of electrocatalysts can be significantly improved by optimizing the electronic structure and designing suitable nanostructure. In this work, we represent the synthesis of hollow CoVOx/Ag-5 for OER. Due to the interaction of CoVOx and Ag nanoparticles, the electronic structure is optimized to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity. Additionally, the extrinsic catalytic activity of CoVOx/Ag is enhanced by the abundant active sites from the hollow structure. As a result, the CoVOx/Ag-5 demonstrates significantly enhanced OER catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm−2. In addition, it also exhibits excellent durability, without obvious attenuation in performance after continuous operation for 60 h. Furthermore, the catalyst can enable full water splitting with appropriate 100 % Faraday efficiency, demonstrating its practical application.

Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are abundant and cost-effective materials. However, poor conductivity and low intrinsic activity limit their application in electrolyzed water catalysts. Herein, we prepared P-FeMoO4 in situ on nickel foam (P-FMO@NF) by phosphorylation-modified FeMoO4 to optimize its electrocatalytic properties. Interestingly, phosphorus doping is accompanied by the generation of oxygen vacancies and surface phosphates. Oxygen vacancies accelerated Mo dissolution during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to the rapid reconfiguration of P-FMO@NF to FeOOH and regulating the electronic structure of P-FMO@NF. The formation of phosphates is caused by the substitution of some molybdates with phosphates, which further increases the amount of oxygen vacancies. Hence, the OER overpotential of P-FMO@NF at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is only 206 mV, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential is 154 mV. It was assembled into a water splitting cell with a voltage of just 1.59 V at 10 mA cm−2 and shows excellent stability over 50 h. These excellent electrocatalytic properties are mainly attributed to the oxygen vacancies, which improve the interfacial charge transfer properties of the catalysts. This study provides new insights into phosphorus doping and offers a new perspective on the design of electrocatalysts.

The exploration of efficient and stable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has received increasing attention. However, the limited electronic conductivity of MOFs hinders the electron transfer rate. Herein, we report the preparation of conducting polypyrrole (PPy)-modified MOF nanoflowers (MOF-NFs@PPy) as promising electrocatalysts for OER. The PPy layer significantly increases the electrical conductivity and modulates the ionic transmittance between MOF-NFs and the electrolyte. The interaction of PPy with the MOF-NFs modifies the electronic structure and improves the reaction efficiency at the active sites. The obtained MOF-NFs@PPy exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity with an OER overpotential of only 218 mV@10 mA cm−2 and small Tafel slope of 47.4 mV dec−1. In addition, the MOF-NFs@PPy exhibited excellent long-term stability (>24 h). This work may provide a new idea and a novel construction strategy for MOFs to improve OER performance.

The role of 2D transition metal carbides, also known as MXenes, as active catalyst supports in Co-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts was elucidated through a combination of experimental and computation electrochemistry. Through facile seeding of commericial Co nanoparticles on three different MXene supports (Ti3C2Tx, Mo2Ti2C3Tx, Mo2CTx), Co@MXene catalysts were prepared and their electrochemical properties examined for alkaline OER electrocatalysts. The OER activity enhancement of Co was significantly improved for Mo2CTx and Mo2Ti2C3Tx supports, but marginal on the Ti3C2Tx in rotating disk electrode and membrane electrode assembly tests. The Co@Mo2CTx exhibited the highest anion exchange water electrolysis performance of 2.11 A cm-2 at 1.8 V with over 700 hours of stable performance, exceeding previous benchmarks for non-platinum group (non-PGM) metal OER catalysts. The superior performance was attributed to the strong chemical interaction of Co nanoparticle with the Mo2CTx MXene support. Insights into the electrochemical and chemical oxidation according to MXene type as related to cell durability, as well the effect of electrical conductivity and inherent boosting of electrocatalytic activity of Mo-based MXenes elucidated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations helped explain the performance and durabilty enhancement of Mo-based MXene supports over Ti3C2Tx supports.

Hierarchical carbon skeletons derived from natural wood can be employed as the substrates to fabricate self-supported catalysts. The typically three sections (cross section, radial section, and tangential section) of wood would significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the correlations between anisotropy structure of wood derived hierarchical carbon skeletons and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances was systematically investigated. The cross-sectional wood-derived carbon decorated with Co nanoparticles requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver 50 mA cm-2 superior to those of radial-sectional and tangential-sectional counterparts. The cross-section of wood derived carbon skeleton possesses higher content of Co nanoparticles, which is accounted for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical contribution of anisotropy of carbon skeletons in promoting the OER properties and provides a new paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts.    

    

## Role of Zr in promoted activity of urea oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction for NiFe layered double hydroxide

Electrolysis of water and splitting of urea to produce hydrogen are identified as one of the most attractive approach to reduce environmental pollution. However, this approach is both promising and challenging. In the paper, the NiFeZr LDH material was in situ grown on Ni foam through a one-step hydrothermal process. The electrochemistry activity of the NiFeZr LDH electrode was investigated by two probe reactions, one for the oxidation of urea and the other for the oxidation of water. It is worth mentioning that whether it is the oxidation reaction of urea (potential of 1.42 V @ 10 mA cm−2) or water (overpotential of 350 mV @ 10 mA cm−2), the doping of Zr improves the catalytic activity of the material. What is worth mentioning that the oxidation of urea does significantly decrease energy consumption compared to the oxidation of water. However, experiments show that the catalytic active sites are different in the two reactions. We speculate that iron is the active site for the oxidation of water, while zirconium is the active site for the oxidation of urea. Experiments demonstrate that the promoted performance is assigned to the exposure of the centre site, the rapid charge transfer rate and the improved electron configuration. Density functional theory analysis indicates that this NiFeZr LDH electrode presents optimal adsorption energy for urea, which improves the catalytic activity of the material.

Recently, it is critical but a challenge to exploit economical, high active and stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for advanced rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a robust ORR/OER electrocatalyst (Co2P/H-NPC) was prepared using Co2P nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on a N,P-doped three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous carbon framework with rich defects through carbonizing a hydrogel, involving starch, polyinosinic acid, cobalt(II) acetate and NH4Cl. Co2P NPs and the dual doping of heteroatoms (N and P), as well as the hierarchically porous feature, synergistically endow Co2P/H-NPC with an excellent ORR and OER activities, in terms of positive half-wave potential (0.83 V) and low overpotential (390 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Additionally, the assembled ZAB based on Co2P/H-NPC delivers a peak power density of 120 mW cm−2, and a wonderful discharge-charge cycling stability, indicating good potential for further application in the fields of energy storage and conversion devices.

A Ni–Fe binary alloy ingot, prepared by conventional vacuum smelting, was adopted as substrate in this work to fabricate the anode for water splitting. To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm−2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging. The more complex UOR behavior was analyzed to elucidate the synergy among all constituents functioning through direct or indirect mechanisms for the half-reaction on this binder-free, self-supporting and substrate-rejuvenating anode.

Sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as the half reaction of water electrolysis hindered the production of clean hydrogen, necessitates a cost-effective electrocatalyst. Spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4), characterized by its lower cost, flexibility in oxidation states of cations, and stable spinel structure, holds promise as an OER electrocatalyst. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of its intrinsic electrochemical activity, conductivity, and active surface area. Inspired by the flexible valence states of Ni and Co, in this study, CeO2 was introduced into NiCo2O4 for further electronic structure adjustment. The result was the synthesis of an urchin-like NiCo2O4@CeO2 (NCOC), and the elucidation of its formation mechanisms, expressed conclusively through reaction formulas. NCOC, characterized by an open architecture and a rough surface, ensures rapid mass transportation and charge diffusion. Within NCOC, numerous oxophilic Ce3+ sites with oxygen vacancies construct electron transport pathways, accelerating charge-transfer. This simultaneously induces an increase in the oxidation states and proportions of Ni3+ and Co3+ in NCOC, reinforcing the covalence of Ni–O and Co–O bonds, expediting the ad/desorption of intermediates during OER. The electronic structure variations of NCOC were further verified through density functional theory (DFT) analyses, revealing alterations in adsorption configurations of intermediates and a decrease in adsorption free energies for intermediates on NCOC during OER. In practical terms, NCOC demonstrated a low overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 under 1 M KOH, maintaining long-term electrochemical stability for 100 h. Overall, this study provides a universal approach for designing highly cost-efficient electrocatalysts for OER.

Hot compression bonding is a promising process to fabricate large-scale oxide dispersion strengthened alloys. Inevitable interface oxidation could affect the effectiveness of the joint. The high-temperature oxidation behavior of a 9Cr ODS alloy under limited oxygen condition was investigated. The oxidized surface consisted of inner Fe2O3 scale and outer Cr2O3 particles at 800 oC. Reoxidation at 1000 oC, Cr2O3 particles were decomposed and converted into Cr(Ti)O2. With increasing oxidation time, Fe2O3 and Cr(Ti)O2 were decomposed and Y2O3 pegs formed. Furthermore, TiO2, Y2O3 and Y-Ti-O nanoparticles formed along grain boundaries. In conclusion, the oxide evolution could be summarized as Fe2O3→Cr2O3→Cr(Ti)O2→TiO2→Y2O3→Y-Ti-O nanoparticles. The evolution from initial coarse Cr-rich and Fe-rich oxides to fine Y-Ti-O nanoparticles is expected to be critical for hot compression bonding processes.

This study employed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks in situ on nickel foam (NF). The resulting Ni3S2/Fe3O4/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and robust long-term stability. It achieves a low overpotential of only 220 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec−1 and remains stable in 1.0 M KOH for 66 h. The binder-free self-supported three-dimensional nanoblocks enhance the reaction region and long-term stability. Electronic interactions between Fe3O4 and Ni3S2, coupled with heterogeneous interfaces, optimize the electronic structure, fostering the formation of highly reactive species. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Ni3S2/Fe3O4, with a heterogeneous interfacial structure, modulates the chemisorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, optimizing the Gibbs free energies (ΔG) of oxygen-containing intermediates. The synergistic effect between the two active materials within the heterogeneous structure enhances OER catalytic performance. This finding offers a valuable approach to designing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.

Seawater oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kind of feasible method to solve energy problems. Through studying seawater OER, it can not only reduce the dependence on traditional energy sources, but also protect the environment and reducing pollution. Cationic defect engineering can effectively enhance the properties of seawater OER. This way can make more catalysts active sites exposed and simultaneously change the electronic properties of materials to improve the conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, defects lead to electron delocalization, promote carrier migration and increase the charge transfer rate of materials. Cationic vacancy defects can effectively improve the OER properties of materials. Therefore, studying relationship between structure and function of vacancy defect electrocatalysts is beneficial to improve the seawater OER performance better. The transition metal-based vacancy catalyst has good seawater OER performance, for example, Fe, Co and Ni based vacancy catalysts. The influence of cationic vacancy on the improvement of OER performance in seawater was further expounded by the DFT of analysis of cationic vacancy catalyst. With the continuous progress of technology, the cost of seawater electrolysis technology will be gradually reduced, which can greatly promote the development of sustainable and renewable clean energy.

Ammonia (NH3) is globally one of the most produced chemicals. Despite being known for its use as a fuel and as a precursor of multiple chemicals, during its production, it is responsible for more than 1.2% of the total global CO2 emission and consumes a large amount of energy. In this work, we studied a flow‐through membrane‐free electrocatalytic device (CMED) to produce continuous stream of NH3 from a common water contaminant, nitrate (NO3−). Indium‐palladium (In‐Pd) nanoparticles were impregnated in activated carbon cloth (ACC) and used as a cathode in the electrochemical device. It is found that in the counter electrode, adding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active catalysts like platinum (Pt) for the regeneration of hydrogen ions enhances the rate of ammonia conversion to 7.28 µmol min−1 cm−2, eliminate the production of toxic nitrite by‐products, as well as provide a platform for a stable energy consumption over long periods of time. This method for the conversion of NO3− into NH3 promises a way forward for sustainable resource utilization while generating fuel from waste and contributing to future circular economies, and managing the nitrogen cycle in water that is a major challenge of the 21st century society.

The exploration of multifunctional electrocatalysts with cost-effective and high kinetic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for the development of advanced energy conversion and storage equipment. Herein, A novel hierarchical mesoporous/macropores MIL-101(Fe) derivative carbon catalyst material was prepared by a simple molten ZnCl2-assisted synthesis route. Specifically, 1H-benzotriazole (BTA) organic ligands were intentionally introduced as nitrogen sources in order to induce the formation of charge-rich regions through an electronegative nitrogen doping control strategy, and most importantly, the lone pair electron-rich nature of element N could facilitate the separation and anchoring of iron species enchanted the utilization rate of active sites. Because of these properties, the as-prepared catalyst (denoted as FeSACs/NxC) possesses unrivalled bifunction electrocatalytic activity and durability for the ORR and OER. The FeSACs/N1.25C as working electrode exhibits a quite satisfactory electrochemical performance for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.82 V) and OER (a small overpotential of 302 mV at 10 mA cm−2) in the classic three-electrode configuration. Moreover, the FeSACs/N1.25C-based air cathode imparts encouraging performance in a rechargeable Zn–air battery prototype with an open-circuit voltage of 1.45 V, a specific capacity of 792.16 mAh g−1, an energy density of 871.38 Wh kg−1, and excellent stability for 120 h. This work has opened the way for the development of low-cost, fast kinetic and stable non-noble metal multifunctional catalysts.

Scandium oxide (Sc2 O3 ) is considered as omnipotent "Industrial Ajinomoto" and holds promise in catalytic applications. However, rarely little attention have been paid to its electrochemistry. Here, we reported the first nanocasting design of high-surface area Sc2 O3 with abundant oxygen vacancies (mesoporous VO -Sc2 O3 ) for efficient electrochemical biomass valorization. In the case of the electro-oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), quantitative HMF conversion, high yield and high faradic efficiency of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) via the hydroxymethylfurancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) pathway were achieved by this advanced electrocatalyst. The beneficial effect of the VO on the electrocatalytic performance of the mesoporous VO -Sc2 O3 was revealed by the enhanced adsorption of reactants and the reduced energy barrier in the electrochemical process. The concerted design, in-situ and ex-situ experimental studies and theoretical calculations shown in this work should shed light on the rational elaboration of advanced electrocatalysts, and contribute to the establishment of a circular carbon economy since the bio-plastic monomer and green hydrogen are efficiently synthesized.

Green hydrogen prepared by the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of renewable energy water electrolysis is one of the best choices for future energy. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high theoretical potential limits the efficiency of overall water splitting. Herein, a bifunctional Ni2P-NiSe2 heterostructure aerogel (Ni-P-Se aerogel) was constructed to boost HER and replace OER by 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to produce high-valued 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with low operating voltage and high conversion. The NiSe2 with cubic pyrite-type crystal structure was favor for anodic reconstruction, which allowed the effective generation of activated oxygen species and further promoted HMFOR. Moreover, the coupling of Ni2P modulated the adsorption energy of OH- in HMFOR and enhanced the activity toward HER. Besides, the aerogel structure with porous network structure provides abundant active sites and mass-transfer pathways. Benefit from these advantages, the optimized Ni-P-Se aerogel exhibited high HER performance (68 mV at 10 mA·cm-2), low onset oxidation potential (1.30 V) and high Faradaic efficiency (97.4%) and FDCA production rate (99.2 μmolFDCA·h-1·cm-2) of HMFOR. Compared to OER, the two-electrode system coupled with HMFOR had significantly increased current density at low operating voltage (87 mA·cm-2 increase at 1.50 V), proving the superiority of HMFOR as alternative anodic reaction. This work offers an anticipated perspective of bifunctional electrocatalysts toward the combination of HER and organics oxidation.

Electrochemical water oxidation is believed to be an effective pathway to produce clean, carbon-free, and environmentally sustainable green energy. In this work, we report a simple, easy-to-construct, facile, low-cost, and single-step galvanic technique to synthesize a Pd-supported temperature-assisted MoOx thin film nanocomposite for effective water oxidation. The most suitable nanocomposite exhibits very low overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 with smaller Tafel slope values for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes in an alkaline medium. The formation of a metal oxide-metal junction accelerates the growth of more active sites, promoting induced electronic synergism at the MoOx-Pd interface. This endows higher electrical conductivity and faster electron transfer kinetics, thus accelerating the faster water dissociation reaction following the Tafel-Volmer mechanism to boost the HER process in an alkaline medium. The excellent electrochemical HER and OER performances of our electrocatalyst even supersede the accomplishments of the benchmark catalysts Pt/C and RuO2. Moreover, neither of these two catalysts demonstrates both catalytic reactions, i.e., HER and OER at the same time, which have been observed for our synthesized catalyst. Our findings illustrate the potential of a thin-film MoOx-Pd nanocomposite to be an exceedingly effective electrocatalyst developed by interface engineering strategies. This also provides insight into designing several other semiconductor composite catalysts using simple synthesis techniques for highly efficient HER/OER processes that could be alternatives to benchmark electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.

The anode stability is critical for efficient and reliable seawater electrolyzers. Herein, a NiFe-based film catalyst was prepared by anodic oxidation to serve as a model electrode, which exhibited a satisfactory oxygen evolution performance in simulated alkaline seawater (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl) with an overpotential of 348 mV at 100 mA cm–2 and a long-term stability of over 100 h. After that, the effects of the current density and bulk pH of the electrolyte on its stability were evaluated. It was found that the electrode stability was sensitive to electrolysis conditions, failing at 20 mA cm–2 in 0.1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl but over 500 mA cm–2 in 0.5 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl. The electrode dissolved, and some precipitates immediately formed at the region very close to the electrode surface during the electrolysis. This can be ascribed to the pH difference between the electrode/electrolyte interface and the bulk electrolyte under anodic polarization. In other words, the microzone acidification accelerates the corrosion of the electrode by Cl–, thus affecting the electrode stability. The operational performances of the electrode under different electrolysis conditions were classified to further analyze the degradation behavior, which resulted in three regions corresponding to the stable oxygen evolution, violent dissolution–precipitation, and complete passivation processes, respectively. Thereby increasing the bulk pH could alleviate the microzone acidification and improve the stability of the anode at high current densities. Overall, this study provides new insights into understanding the degradation mechanism of NiFe-based catalysts and offers electrolyte engineering strategies for the application of anodes.

Perovskites have become promising alternatives to precious metal-catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report the synthesis of several perovskite nanofibers, specifically La0.6Sr0.4CoxNi1-xO3-δ (LSCN), and investigate their electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in alkaline electrolytes. La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ (LSCN-0.8) is selected and immersed in an aqueous NaBH4 solution for 1 h for surface reconstruction. The perovskite nanofibers' electrocatalytic OER activity and stability are rigorously evaluated using a standard three-electrode system. Results reveal that even a slight Co substitution for Ni content within the LSCN perovskite structure has a notable impact on electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, LSCN-0.8 exhibits an overpotential of 363 mV at 20 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH. However, significant improvement is observed after the surface reconstruction process. The optimized LSCN-0.8 (now called LSCN-2) displays the lowest OER overpotential (320 mV) under the same conditions. Furthermore, the LSCN-2 nanostructure demonstrates exceptional electrode stability, as evidenced by only a slight decrease in electrocatalytic performance during 5000 cycles of linear sweep voltammetry.

The development of efficient and low-cost metal materials is indispensable in clean energy technology. Metal tungstates have previously been reported as catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). However, ZnWO4 alone does not exhibit significant catalytic activity for OER, it requires 330 mV to drive the reaction at 10 mA cm−2. To address this issue, a self-supporting electrode mixed with tungstate is synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Notably, the Ni-doped ZnWO4 self-supporting material demonstrates improved OER catalytic activity. Specifically, when comparing ZnWO4 to ZnNiWO4, it exhibits a reduced Tafel slope by 190 mV·dec−1, resulting in an overpotential of only 110 mV at 10 mA cm−2, with long-term stability for at least 20 h. Furthermore, the d-band center of ZnNiWO4 is modeled using Materials Studio and simulated through projected density of states (PDOS) calculations. These calculations reveal that the presence of Ni activates the metal ion as an OER active site with strong orbital overlap with the reaction intermediate. This adjustment in the electronic structure of the Ni–Zn metal active site during the oxygen evolution reaction alters the adsorption energy. Consequently, doping of Ni enhances the metal's ability to adsorb *OOH radical, shifting the d-band center of ZnNiWO4 further away from the Fermi level, and facilitates rapid oxygen release.

Hydrogen gas is a promising renewable energy storage medium when produced via water electrolysis, but this process is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we used a microkinetic model to investigate promoting the OER using programmable oxide catalysts (i.e., forced catalyst dynamics). We found that programmable catalysts could increase current density at a fixed overpotential (100X to 600X over static rates) or reduce the overpotential required to reach a fixed current density of 10 mA/cm^2 (45 – 140% reduction vs. static). In our kinetic parameterization, the key parameters controlling the quality of the catalytic ratchet were the O*-to-OOH* and O*-to-OH* activation barriers. Our findings indicate that programmable catalysts may be a viable strategy for accelerating the OER or enabling lower-overpotential operation, but a more accurate kinetic parameterization is required for precise predictions of performance, ratchet quality, and resulting energy efficiency.

Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.

Electrocatalytic water (H2O) splitting relies heavily on the rational formation of most effective, long-lasting catalysts that should be cheaper and earth abundant. Therefore, an effective electrocatalyst is the need of the hour that may effectively pursue both electrocatalytic OER and HER. This study paves the way for the straightforward preparation of conductive polymer tailored metal oxide nanocomposite Cu2O/CNTs by a facile hydrothermal approach to be employed as overall water splitting electrocatalyst. The techniques comprising SEM, XRD, EDX and the BET test were employed to characterize the synthesized Cu2O/CNTs electrocatalyst. The generated Cu2O/CNTs electrocatalysts exhibited a Tafel value of 39 mV/dec, an overpotential of 267 mV@10 mA/cm2, and stability of OER activity that lasted for at least 70 hours. The electrocatalytic results show that the combination of Cu2O and CNTs has a synergistic impact to reduce the overpotential value. In an effort to pinpoint the rate determining processes for OER, the voltage of OER is connected to the electrolyte pH and exhibits a non-proton concerted approach. The above designed nanocomposite is quite promising for modern hydrogen production systems due to their quick electron transfer mechanism, remarkable durability, and good activity for OER.

Abstract Perovskite oxides exhibit bifunctional activity for both oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), making them prime candidates for energy conversion in applications like fuel cells and metal‐air batteries. Their intrinsic catalytic prowess, combined with low‐cost, abundance, and diversity, positions them as compelling alternatives to noble metal and metal oxides catalysts. This review encapsulates the nuances of perovskite oxide structures and synthesis techniques, providing insight into pivotal active sites that underscore their bifunctional behavior. The focus centers on the breakthroughs surrounding lanthanum (La) and strontium (Sr)‐based perovskite oxides, specifically their roles in zinc‐air batteries (ZABs). An introduction to the mechanisms of ORR and OER is provided. Moreover, the light is shed on strategies and determinants central to optimizing the bifunctional performance of La and Sr‐based perovskite oxides.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involved 4-electron transfers is generally considered as the bottleneck for electrocatalytic water splitting. High-entropy oxides (HEO) show promising potential for OER due to their flexible structures and tunable compositions. Herein, we report a facile strategy to synthesize spinel-type (FeCoNiMnCr)3O4 HEO nanotubes (NTs) with unique hollow structures by combining electrospinning process and calcination treatment. The (FeCoNiMnCr)3O4 HEO NTs prepared at 400 °C exhibit the low overpotential of 353 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and small Tafel slope of 55.6 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber-based architecture ensure the superior stability, as evidenced by the stable current density under continuous OER process for more than 60 h. Meanwhile, the hollow structure provides abundant exposed active sites, which could significantly improve the OER activity. This work provides new design of low-cost and high-efficient HEO with ensemble active sites for OER.

An efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are widely required in the realm of water electrolysis and rechargeable metal-air batteries. This work describes an easy and simple method for the synthesis of copper salen (Cu(Salen))-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanocomposite materials (Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs). It was used for OER in the basic medium (0.1 M KOH). The resulting nanocomposite, Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs, was studied using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. For example, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), UV-visible spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The electrochemical characterization of prepared Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs nanocomposite based modified glassy carbon (GC) electrodes (GC/Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs) and their application towards OER were performed using an electrochemical method. The Tafel slope of nanocomposite material is 159.6 mv/dec in 0.1 M KOH solution, indicating that GC/Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs could be a promising and cost-effective electrode material for the OER. This study demonstrates a novel way for creating an active nanocomposite catalyst for OER in alkaline media.

In this work, we report copper oxide nanofibers (CuO – N) synthesized by Solution Blow Spinning (SBS) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and their comparison with a control sample based on a commercial powder (CuO – C). Both materials were characterized by various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and spectroscopy (Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman and X-ray photoelectron (XPS)) to confirm the purity, and microstructural and surface chemical properties. Subsequently, the performance of copper oxide catalysts in a 1.0 M KOH solution was investigated. Copper oxide with nanofiber morphology (CuO – N) exhibited a small overpotential of 385 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel coefficient of only 76 mV dec−1, i.e., fast kinetics for water splitting, a result that is modulated by oxygen vacancies (O2/O1 = 0.83). The oxygen vacancies are due to the presence of Cu1+ in the lattice. The analyses of the magnetization measurements at 5 K suggest a larger amount of Cu1+ in sample CuO – N. Therefore, this work sheds light on how to design low-cost nanofibrous catalysts based on abundant transition metals in the earth's crust by SBS, an economical and scalable technique, which is promising for energy applications.

Exploring highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has become a growing interest in recent years. Herein, an efficient pathway for designing MXene-based ORR/OER catalysts is proposed. It involves introducing non-noble metals into Vo (vacancy site), H1 and H2 (the hollow sites on top of C and the metal atom, respectively) sites on M2CO2 surfaces, named TM-VO/H1/H2-M2CO2 (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, M = V, Nb, Ta). Among these recombination catalysts, Co-H1-V2CO2 and Ni-H1-V2CO2 exhibit the most promising ORR catalytic activities, with low overpotential values of 0.35 and 0.37 V, respectively. Similarly, Fe-H1-V2CO2, Co-VO-Nb2CO2, and Ni-H2-Nb2CO2 possess low OER overpotential values of 0.29, 0.39, and 0.44 V, respectively, suggesting they have enormous potential as effective catalysts for OER. Notably, Co-H2-Ta2CO2 possesses the lowest potential gap value of 0.53 V, demonstrating it has an extraordinary bifunctional catalytic activity. The excellent catalytic performance of these recombination catalysts can be elucidated through an electronic structure analysis, which primarily relies on the electron-donating capacity and synergistic effects between transition metals and sub-metals. These results provide theoretical guidance for designing new ORR and OER catalysts using 2D MXene materials.

Ni-Fe-based catalysts are considered to be among the most active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions, with Fe playing a crucial role. However, Fe leaching occurs during the reaction due to thermodynamic instability, which has resulted in conflicting reports within the literature regarding its role. To clarify this point, we propose a strategy consisting of modulating the electronic orbital occupancy to suppress the extensive loss of Fe atoms during the OER process. Theoretical calculations, in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and a series of characterization showed that the stable presence of Fe not only accelerates the electron transfer process but also optimizes the reaction barriers of the oxygen evolution intermediates, promoting the phase transition of Fe5Ni4S8 to highly active catalytic species. The modulated Fe5Ni4S8-based pre-catalysts exhibit improved OER activity and long-term durability. This study provides a novel perspective for understanding the role of Fe in the OER process.

Exploring cost-effective non-noble metal-based catalysts with high activity and stability is of great significance for energy conversion and storage involving oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we employed a laser irradiation technique to synthesis Fe doped CoO nanoparticles with ultrafine size (≈ 5.4 nm) and abundant oxygen vacancies (Fe-Ov-CoO). The ultrafine size of Fe-Ov-CoO nanoparticles provides more active sites to be exposed. Fe doping and oxygen vacancy promote the intrinsic activity and electron transfer rates of Fe-Ov-CoO, giving rise to high activity and stability catalyst for OER. Fe-Ov-CoO delivers a large current density of 1000 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 548 mV, which is much better than commercial RuO2. Moreover, Fe-Ov-CoO presents a remarkable long-term stability with negligible degeneration at a high current density of 500 mA cm−2 for 120 h. This work provides a new route to develop OER electrocatalyst with high activity and stability.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in electrochemical conversion, which needs efficient and economical electrocatalyst to boost its kinetics for large-scale application. Herein, a bimetallic CoP/FeP2 heterostructure with a three-dimensional ordered macroporous structure (3DOM-CoP/FeP2) was synthesized as an OER catalyst to demonstrate a heterogeneous engineering induction strategy. By adjusting the electron distribution and producing a lot of active sites, the heterogeneous interface enhances catalytic performance. High specific surface area is provided by the 3DOM structure. Additionally, at the solid-gas-electrolyte threephase interface, the electrocatalytic reaction exhibits good mass transfer. In-situ Raman spectroscopy characterization revealed that FeOOH and CoOOH reconstructed from CoP/FeP2 were the true OER active sites. Consequently, the 3DOM-CoP/FeP2 demonstrates superior OER activity with a low overpotentials of 300/420 mV at 10/100 mA cm–2 and meritorious OER durability. It also reveals promising performance as the overall water splitting anode.&#xD;
