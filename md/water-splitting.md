Regulating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of N-doped carbon-based catalyst to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of prospective to the wide-ranging applications of rechargeable zinc-air batteries. In this work, a facile double-enhancing strategy is proposed to prepared a bifunctional catalyst to ORR and OER. In the strategy, the smaller carbon particles were generated by carbonizing cyclodextrin. The fresh carbon material can react with the gaseous product of melamine to favor the anchoring of nitrogen to prepare the N-doped Fe-N-CD-C-A2 catalyst to ORR. Then an OER-enhanced bifunctional catalyst Fe-N-CD-C-A2-Ni was prepared by separately blending Ni2+ and OH- with Fe-N-CD-C-A2 to evenly load Ni(OH)2 particles as OER catalyst. Benefiting from the intentionally regulated properties, the Fe-N-CD-C-A2-Ni shows 0.8728 V of ORR half wave potential and 1.6868 V of OER potential at 10 mA cm-2, both being realized in a practical rechargeable zinc-air battery with 1.526 V of open circuit potential, 192 mW cm-2 of peak power density, 1.18-1.27 V of discharge voltage plateau and 957 mWh g-1 Zn of energy density. Importantly, the Fe-N-CD-C-A2-Ni exhibits superior rechargeability and durability during the discharge-recharge cycles, being very superior than those of Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst and revealing the promising prospect in the practical application.

Exploiting low-cost and efficient transition metal-based oxygen evolution catalysts is significant for water splitting. Herein, the composite catalyst (NiFeS2/NiFe-LDH) with the flower-like nanostructure was prepared on the surface of nickel-iron binary alloy. The sulfuretted catalyst displays larger Cdl (8.8 mF cm-2) and higher TOF (0.44 s-1). It also showed a low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm-2. In addition, it shows excellent stability at 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2 for 10 h without a noticeable activity loss. The strategy of combining layered double hydroxides with transition bimetallic sulfides may provide important insights for the exploitation of low-cost and high-activity OER catalysts.

Abstract Ruthenium oxide is currently considered as the promising alternative to Ir‐based catalysts employed for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers but still faces the bottlenecks of limited durability and slow kinetics. Herein, a 2D amorphous/crystalline heterophase ac‐Cr 0.53 Ru 0.47 O 2‐δ substitutional solid solution with pervasive grain boundaries (GBs) is developed to accelerate the kinetics of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and extend the long‐term stability simultaneously. The ac‐Cr 0.53 Ru 0.47 O 2‐δ shows a super stability with a slow degradation rate and a remarkable mass activity of 455 A g Ru −1 at 1.6 V vs RHE, which is ≈3.6‐ and 5.9‐fold higher than those of synthesized RuO 2 and commercial RuO 2 , respectively. The strong interaction of Cr–O–Ru local units in synergy with the specific 2D structural characteristics of ac‐Cr 0.53 Ru 0.47 O 2‐δ dominates its enhanced stability. Meanwhile, high‐density GBs and the shortened Ru‐O bonds tailored by amorphous/crystalline structure and Cr–O–Ru interaction regulate the adsorption and desorption rates of oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the overall acidic OER kinetics.

The different ratios of CoII(OH)2 decorated on sulfur doped nano carbon soot (SDCN) nanoparticles were synthesized and described as Co2II@SDCN, Co4II@SDCN, Co6II@SDCN, and Co8II@SDCN nanoparticles electrocatalysts. The collaborative effect of SDCN and Co concentration boosted the electron conductivity and constancy of CoII@SDCN. SDCN significantly binds cobalt ions and inhibits aggregation. The Co8II@SDCN/GC reveals a very low potential of 361 mV at 10 mAcm−2 current density and its Tafel is lesser than that of IrO2 (54 mV dec−1). Co8II@SDCN/GC showed a computed turnover frequency of 0.0165 s−1, around 9 times more than IrO2 0.0016 s−1 at 1.60 V. The Co8II@SDCN/NF electrode catalyst also exhibits a remarkably low potential of 251 mV @10 mA cm−2. In an alkaline medium, this brand-new Co8II@SDCN/NF displays durability over a period of 250 h with only a 5.1% potential loss. Excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and sufficient kinetics in the Co8II@SDCN catalyst allow it to address the slow rate of water oxidation. The solar-assisted water electrolysis demonstration at 1.54 V confirms the effectiveness of the newly developed electrocatalyst in the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen. These results demonstrate that Co8II@SDCN can be utilized to produce hydrogen on a big scale at the lowest possible cost.

Abstract Isolated metal-coordinated nitrogen embedded carbon (M-N-C) materials are potential alternatives to noble catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the activity of metal centers can be further modulated by adjusting the coordination environment. Recently, experimental studies have shown that the aggregation of metal atoms into small clusters or particles is inevitable during the high temperature pyrolysis, while the influences of metal clusters on the OER activity of single metal atoms in M-N-C are unclear. Herein, taking Ni-based single atom as examples, the interaction characters of NiN4 doped graphene (NiN4-graphene) with different Ni clusters were studied. The modulation effects of Ni clusters to the NiN4-graphene were systematically investigated from the geometric configurations, electronic structures, and the OER activity of the Ni single atom. It was found that the OER&#xD;performance of NiN4-graphene can be remarkably improved through the addition of Ni clusters, and the lowest overpotential of 0.43 V is achieved on NiN4-graphene with the modification of Ni13 cluster, which is smaller than that of 0.69 V on NiN4-graphene. Electronic properties calculations showed that the charge transfer from Ni clusters to NiN4-graphene will alter the density of states of Ni single atom near the Fermi level, which promotes the charge transfer from NiN4-graphene to oxygen containing products and optimizes the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediate to close to the ideal adsorption free energy of 2.46 eV by enhancing the hybridization interaction between the O-p orbitals and the Ni-dxz, Ni-dyz orbitals, and finally leading to an enhanced OER activity. The current findings highlight the important role of metal clusters on improving the catalytic performance of M-N-C materials, which benefits for the rational design of M-N-C catalysts with high catalytic activity.

The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for many renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. However, the high energy required to break the strong covalent O-H bond of H2O in acidic media results in sluggish OER kinetics. Here, we report the critical role of iron in a new family of iron-containing yttrium ruthenate (Y2-xFexRu2O7-δ) electrocatalysts in highly increasing the electrophilicity of surface oxygen, leading to a significant reduction of the kinetics barrier by 33%, thus an exceptional OER mass activity of 1,021 A · g Ru − 1 up to 12.4 and 7.7 times that of Y2Ru2O7-δ and RuO2, respectively. Introducing iron reduces the Mulliken atomic charge on the O sites in the generated Ru-O-Fe structure, thereby facilitating the acid-base nucleophilic assault from H2O and reducing the free energy on the rate-determining step of OER. This work provides an effective strategy to reduce the kinetics barrier to achieve highly efficient and economic OER in acidic conditions.

Low-cost and highly efficient cathode and anode materials are required for proton exchange membrane and alkaline water electrolyzers. The present work demonstrates the development of a bifunctional cathode and anode material for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) in an alkaline environment. The bimetallic Ni–Mo selenide is fabricated over the MXene (Ti3C2Tx) grown over the activated carbon fibers by an inexpensive, simple one-step and eco-friendly approach. The electrocatalyst NiMoSe/Ti3C2Tx@CC is developed via a hydrothermal method wherein NiMoSe is observed to grow highly dense nanoporous structure as confirmed by various characterization techniques. Highest activity for HER is observed using NiMoSe/Ti3C2Tx@CC with only overpotential of 203 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with low Tafel slope (45 mV dec−1). The catalyst is also proven to support OER activity with requirement of 320 mV as overpotential at 10 mA cm−2, thus better than commercial IrO2 (η10 = 380 mV). The Tafel slope obtained by NiMoSe/Ti3C2Tx@CC for OER is found to be minimum (189 mV dec−1) along with a very low charge transfer resistance (3.04 Ω) and high electrochemical surface area (0.0378 mF cm−2). The NiMoSe/Ti3C2Tx@CC is found to be highly stable for HER/OER with 1000 LSV cycles.

The discovery of acid-stable and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in the quest for high-performance water-splitting technologies. Herein, a heterostructured RuO2–CeO2 electrocatalyst was constructed by using a lattice-matching strategy. The interfacial Ru–O–Ce bridge structure provided a channel for electron transfer between Ru and Ce, creating a lattice stress that distorts the local structure of RuO2. The resulting RuO2–CeO2 catalyst exhibited attractive stability with negligible decay after 1000 h of the OER in 0.5 M H2SO4, along with high activity with an overpotential of only 180 mV at 10 mA cm–2. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to reveal that the interface and noninterface RuO2 sites enabled an oxide path mechanism (OPM) and the enhanced adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM-plus), respectively, during the OER. The simultaneous and independent OER pathways accessible by lattice matching guides improved electrocatalyst design for the OER in acidic media.

Intermediates in the overall water splitting on particulate photocatalysts were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap. In situ EPR spectra under ultraviolet light showed the exclusive formation of a hydroxyl radical adduct (•DMPO-OH) over Ga2O3 and NaTaO3:La without a Rh–Cr oxide cocatalyst. In contrast, the Rh–Cr oxide cocatalyst-loaded photocatalysts active for water splitting formed a 5,5-dimethyl-2-oxo-pyrroline-1-oxyl radical (•DMPOX). •DMPOX is suggested as an indicator of the surface peroxyl radical intermediate (M-OO•) in the oxygen evolution reaction pathway.

The large-scale production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis is hindered due to the higher overpotential required for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While commercial use of noble metal oxide OER catalysts suffer from poor stability and cost ineffectiveness, the development of non-noble metal-based OER catalysts is still a challenge to overcome. The compositional and structural flexibility of 3D perovskite oxides presents a distinct opportunity to design electrocatalysts that can overcome the kinetic sluggishness of OER and address its associated limitations. Herein, we have designed and synthesized a series of 3D perovskite catalysts, Ba3–xSrxMTiSbO9 (x = 1, 1.5 for Co and x = 2 for Mn/Co), by the conventional solid-state method. The Co analogues exhibit exceptional OER performance when compared with the manganese counterpart and a similar or comparable overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 (η10) but with a significantly lower overpotential at 100 mA/cm2 (η100) as compared to RuO2, benchmark electrocatalysts for OER. The Co compounds have also shown superior kinetics as compared to RuO2. The charge-transfer resistance across interfaces measured by operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at different potentials follow the activity order of the compounds. The higher electrocatalytic activity of Ba3–xSrxCoTiSbO9 originates from higher d-electron counts, close to unity filling of the eg-orbital electrons, structural factor, μ/t (μ = perovskite B-cation to O2– radius ratio and t = tolerance factor), and higher lattice oxygen participation. A plausible mechanism is also provided based on the pH-dependent OER study. The Co perovskite with the highest lattice oxygen participation and lowest μ/t exhibited the highest OER activity and fastest kinetics. The study demonstrates a nonconventional tool of A-cation manipulation in synthesizing non-noble metal-based 3D perovskites as efficient OER electrocatalysts despite the elusive nature of their active sites.

In this work, non-peripherally tetra 3-(4-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)phenoxy) substituted nickel(II) phthalocyanine (NiPc), cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc), zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc), copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and lead(II) phthalocyanine (PbPc) were synthesized. The structural characterization of the novel compounds was performed by a combination of instrumental methods. The electrochemical and in-situ spectroelectrochemical responses of the compounds were recorded and redox properties were illuminated. Graphitic carbon nitride(g-C3N4) was synthesized by thermal decomposition of urea and combined with metallophthalocyanines to avoid agglomeration of phthalocyanine, to obtain homogeneous microstructured catalyst and to provide synergistic effects between pyridinic N-metal bonds of g-C3N4 and metallophthalocyanines (MPcs).

Noble metal electrocatalysts are highly preferred for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis cell (PEMWE) due to their exceptional catalytic activity and stability. This study proposes a novel thin electrode (NTE) design to enhance the performance of noble metal electrocatalysts for the OER in PEMWE. The NTE utilizes a thin porous transport layer for the direct deposition of Iridium (Ir). Unlike conventional gas diffusion electrodes with deep porous structures that underutilize the catalyst due to limited triple-phase boundary conditions, the flat NTEs with straight-through pores overcome this restriction. The paper compares two deposition methods, electroplating and sputter coating. The in-situ electrochemical properties of NTEs with varying Ir loadings (0.06–1.01 mg cm−2) are investigated. The electroplated NTE demonstrates excellent mass activity, achieving 5.05 A mg−1 at 1.6 V and 80 °C. The NTE exhibits a simple fabrication process and low cost while significantly improving catalyst mass activity. Additionally, the NTE reduces electrode thickness from hundreds of micrometers to only 25 μm. This concept holds great promise for the future advancement of compact and high-efficiency PEMWE electrodes, resulting in reduced cost, volume, and mass of both the electrode itself and the overall system.

Hydrogen has recently attracted a lot of attention as a clean as well as sustainable energy source. However, the vast bulk of industrial hydrogen is produced by converting natural gas into hydrogen. One of the primary goals of large-scale electrolysis is to find efficient, cost-effective, stable, and many other catalysts capable of producing hydrogen from water with minimal electrical bias. Using readily available electrocatalysts on Earth to facilitate the oxidation of water is one way to get closer to an effective method of splitting water to produce hydrogen. Here in the present work, CuWO4 was coated on the conducting polypyrrole (PPy) polymer via hydrothermal techniques to boost its catalytic performance. The fabricated PPy/CuWO4 composite is then utilized for water splitting to yield hydrogen in addition to oxygen. The PPy is able to raise the CuWO4 Fermi levels are separated, as a result, the PPy/CuWO4 produced a large number of strong and readily accessible charges, which led to the splitting of water into hydrogen, and demonstrated that at a potential of 1.470 V vs. RHE, the current density intended for CuWO4-3/PPY reached 10 mAcm−2, attaining an overpotential of 197 mV, with a Tafel plot slope of about 34.4 mVdec−1, and also with a charge transfer resistance of 2.3Ω for OER. Furthermore, the HER activity also attained lower overpotential (250 mV), with a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec−1 in order to reach a 10 mAcm−2 current density. In addition, the CuWO4 is completely encased by the PPy, facilitating charge transfer, allowing the particles to travel rapidly to the polymer's surface. Hence, this study demonstrates that the highly effective CuWO4-3/PPy nanocomposite is responsible for future energy-related applications.

Abstract Developing efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional electrocatalysts is attractive for rechargeable metal–air batteries. Meanwhile, single metal atoms embedded in 2D layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) have become a very promising catalyst. Recently, many attentions have been paid to the 2D ReS 2 electrocatalyst due to its unique distorted octahedral 1T’ crystal structure and thickness‐independent electronic properties. Here, the catalytic activity of different transition metal (TM) atoms embedded in ReS 2 using the density functional theory is investigated. The results indicate that TM@ReS 2 exhibits outstanding thermal stability, good electrical conductivity, and electron transfer for electrochemical reactions. And the Ir@ReS 2 and Pd@ReS 2 can be used as OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalysts with a lower overpotential for OER (η OER ) of 0.44 V and overpotentials for ORR (η ORR ) of 0.26 V and 0.27 V, respectively. The excellent catalytic activity is attributed to the optimal adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates coming from the effective modulation of the electronic structure of ReS 2 after Ir/Pd doping. The results can help to deeply understand the catalytic activity of TM@ReS 2 and develop novel and highly efficient OER/ORR electrocatalysts.

Electrochemical water‐splitting to produce hydrogen is potential to substitute the traditional industrial coal gasification, but the oxygen evolution kinetics at the anode remains sluggish. In this paper, sea urchin‐like Fe doped Ni3S2 catalyst growing on nickel foam (NF) substrate is constructed via a simple two‐step strategy, including surface iron activation and post sulfuration process. The NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2 obtains at temperature of 130 ℃ (NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130) features nanoneedle‐like arrays which are vertically grown on the particles to form sea urchin‐like morphology, features high electrochemical surface area. As oxygen evolution catalyst, NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130 exhibits excellent oxygen evolution activities, fast reaction kinetics, and superior reaction stability. The excellent OER performance of sea urchin‐like NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130 is mainly ascribed to the high‐vertically dispersive of nanoneedles and the existing Fe dopants, which obviously improved the reaction kinetics and the intrinsic catalytic properties. The simple preparation strategy is conducive to establish high‐electrochemical‐interface catalysts, which shows great potential in renewable energy conversion.

At this moment, non-aqueous rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) with extremely high energy density are regarded as the most viable energy storage devices to potentially replace petroleum. One of the most crucial impediments to their implementation has been ensuring facile oxygen availability. Moreover, as semi-sealed systems, LOBs have confronted challenges including oxygen impurities, product degradation, anode corrosion, frequent side reactions, and mediocre cycling performance. In this work, utilizing the physical adsorption of porous (micro-, meso- and macro-porous) solid carbon materials, we incorporate an oxygen storage layer (OSL) with reversible oxygen ad/desorption capabilities into a LOB to develop novel fully-sealed lithium-oxygen batteries (F-S-LOBs). The results demonstrate mesoporous carbons exhibit optimal oxygen adsorption/desorption kinetics, rendering them highly suitable for F-S-LOBs without developing complex oxygen-permeable membranes or carrying oxygen tanks. The OSL fabricated with mesoporous carbon can sustain battery charge/discharge at various current densities with exceptional cycling performance. Additionally, we provide approximate pore size guidelines for oxygen storage materials to aid future research. This study is anticipated to offer a new robust research direction for metal-air batteries and to forge a new path toward promoting the commercialization and development of this technology.

The advancement of extremely effective and long-lasting sustainable electrocatalysts developed from abundant earth elements is an emergence aspect in green energy generation. The greenly synthesised NCF-LDH has been shown that promising candidate for the OER process. Mechnochemical processes are often quick, inexpensive, and easily scalable to produce industrial quantities. In comparison with IrO2 (370 mV), the optimum NCF-LDH-X on GC electrode showed the modest required overpotential (240 mV) at 10 mA cm−2. Solar-assisted water oxidation at 1.57 V shows more expert efficacy of NCF-LDH-2 for solar to hydrogen generation. As an outcome, the greenly synthesised NCF-LDH outperformed the high-priced electrocatalysts. Consequently, low-cost industrial-scale H2 generation using commercial solar cells might be possible.

Understanding the function of individual elements in high-entropy perovskites is one of the critical issues for the design of inexpensive and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Here, we report our findings in boosting the electrochemical activity and durability of a high-entropy perovskite catalyst via sequential substitution of Sr2+ for the A-site elements. According to the Sr2+ localized tuned, the catalyst of (LaSmGdSrPr)0.2MnO3 has a half-wave potential of 0.786 V vs. RHE and an overpotential of 0.378 V and has better ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity than the Sr-free high-entropy perovskite catalyst (LaSmGdYPr)0.2MnO3.This is attributed to the local doping of Sr2+ activating the active center of the high-entropy perovskite catalyst (LaSmGdSrPr)0.2MnO3, modulating the adsorption energy of the oxygen-containing intermediates and the electronic structure of the transition metal at the B-site, which results in efficient oxygen electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the introduction of Sr2+ enhances the hybridization between Mn 2p and O 1 s and accelerates the adsorption and desorption kinetics of the intermediates, leading to both enhanced activity and durability of (LaSmGdSrPr)0.2MnO3. DFT theoretical calculations also demonstrate the key role played by Sr2+ in the high-entropy perovskite structure for the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity. This study provides new insights for designing high-entropy electrocatalysts for various potential applications.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical cathode reaction for hydrogen production from water splitting. However, due to the sluggish kinetics of OER, the water-splitting process is impeded. Thus, it is imperative to develop efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts that reduce the overpotential and improve the kinetics of OER. Herein, an in-situ synthesis strategy was applied to prepare the ionic liquid functionalized carbon nanotube (IL-CNT) that served as a metal-free electrocatalyst for OER. This powder material exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic activity for OER, with an overpotential of 335 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec-1. Then, it was found that catalytic activity was influenced by the IL anion. Moreover, this IL-CNT powder could self-assemble to form carbon film during preparation, exhibiting outstanding catalytic activity for OER (a low overpotential of 153 mV at 10 mA cm−2), which was highly beneficial for practical application. Based on the theoretical calculations and experimental results, these in-situ functionalization sites on CNT surface played a significant role in regulating their electron structure. This, in turn, promoted electron transfer and hydroxyl adsorption, resulting in a substantial increase in catalytic activity for the OER.

Abstract Hydroxides are the archetype of layered crystals with metal‐oxygen (M‐O) octahedron units, which have been widely investigated as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. However, the better crystallinity of hydroxide materials, the more perfect octahedral symmetry and atomic ordering, resulting in the less exposed metal sites and limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a glassy state hydroxide material featuring with short‐range order and long‐range disorder structure is developed to achieve high intrinsic activity for OER. Specifically, a rapid freezing point precipitation method is utilized to fabricate amorphous multi‐component hydroxide. Owing to the freezing‐point crystallization environment and chaotic M‐O (M = Ni/Fe/Co/Mn/Cr etc.) structures, the as‐fabricated NiFeCoMnCr hydroxide exhibit a highly‐disordered glassy structure, as‐confirmed by X‐ray/electron diffraction, enthalpic response, and pair distribution function analysis. The as‐achieved glassy‐state hydroxide materials display a low OER overpotential of 269 mV at 20 mA cm −2 with a small Tafel slope of 33.3 mV dec −1 , outperform the benchmark noble‐metal RuO 2 catalyst (341 mV, 84.9 mV dec −1 ) . Operando Raman and density functional theory studies reveal that the glassy state hydroxide converted into disordered active oxyhydroxide phase with optimized oxygen intermediates adsorption under low OER overpotentials, thus boosting the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity.

Abstract Improving the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to realise energy systems based on water electrolysis. Many catalysts have been developed for the OER to date, with iridium‐based oxides being the most promising due to their relative stability towards corrosion in acidic electrolytes under oxidising potentials. In recent years, examples of catalysts adopting layered structures have been shown to have promising characteristics such as higher conductivity and higher electrochemically active surface area compared to highly crystalline metal oxides. Furthermore, such materials possess additional tuneable properties such as interlayer spacing, identity and concentration of the interlayer species, edge and interlayer active sites, and higher active surface area. Recent attention has focused on mono‐ and polymetallic lithium‐containing layered materials, where the presence of interlayer lithium cations, in situ delithiation processes and combinations of transition metal oxides result in enhanced catalytic properties towards OER. This review aims to provide a summary of the recent developments of such layered materials, in which lithium or other alkali metal ions occupy interlayer sites in oxides.

Water electrolysis is attracting increasing attention in becoming the main method for green energy production, which has long been hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and high cost of noble-metal (NM) containing electrodes. Template replication technique has been employed to fabricate porous CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy (HEA) bulk foams with > 95 % porosity. High entropy led to the formation of a single-phase solid solution of transition metals in the as-fabricated porous HEA bulk foam, and the lattice distortion brings about the outstanding OER performance that is close to that of the RuO2 reference sample. Effective electrochemically active surface area and amount of exposed active sites are increased by grinding into nanoparticles, which produced superior OER performance with a near-record low overpotential of ∼ 245 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm2, a low Tafel slope of 73.6 mV/dec, a double layer capacitance of 102.3 mF, and excellent long-term stability over 24 h. This work demonstrates a cost-effective way to fabricate NM-free HEA electrocatalyst with complex structure and excellent stability in OER, which could help in advancing the research for alkaline water electrolysis.

Multi‐principal element alloys (MPEAs) are gaining interest in corrosion and electrocatalysis research due to their electrochemical stability across a broad pH range and the design flexibility they offer. Using the equimolar CrCoNi alloy, we observe significant metal dissolution in a corrosive electrolyte (0.1 M NaCl, pH 2) concurrently with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the transpassive region despite the absence of hysteresis in polarization curves or other obvious corrosion indicators. We present a characterization scheme to delineate the contribution of OER and alloy dissolution, using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for OER‐onset detection, and quantitative chemical analysis with inductively coupled‐mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) and ultraviolet visible light (UV‐Vis) spectroscopy to elucidate metal dissolution processes. In‐situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC‐AFM) revealed that the transpassive metal dissolution on CrCoNi is dominated by intergranular corrosion. These results have significant implications for the stability of MPEAs in corrosion systems, emphasizing the necessity of analytically determining metal ions released from MPEA electrodes into the electrolyte when evaluating Faradaic efficiencies of OER catalysts. The release of transition metal ions not only reduces the Faradaic efficiency of electrolyzers but may also cause poisoning and degradation of membranes in electrochemical reactors.

Nanotubes constructed from methylene-bridged cycloparaphenyleneas (MCPPs) are investigated using density functional theory. The dynamical stability is indicated by the real vibrational frequencies of the infrared spectra. MCPPs are semiconductors with an energy gap of ∼ 2.9 eV that significantly decreases in the finite nanotubes. This decrease is a result of the interactive molecular orbitals that are localized at the pentagonal rings linking MCPPs. The UV-vis spectra show that transitions from the highest occupied and neighbor orbitals to the lowest unoccupied orbital dominate the primary absorption peaks. Oxygen evolution reaction shows that all the reaction intermediates, HO, O, and HOO are adsorbed by the pentagonal active sites. The considered nanotubes show good catalytic performance but the best performance is observed in the wider nanotubes with an overpotential of 0.10 V. This remarkably low overpotential in addition to the abundant active sites makes finite nanotubes from MCPPs exceptional catalysts for oxygen evolution.
