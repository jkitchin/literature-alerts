The time‐dependent mechanism underlying the formation of Co0.8Fe0.2(OH)x‐t nanomesh (nanomesh having 80% Co and 20% Fe, “t” represents materials synthesis time) has been identified towards the development of a highly effective catalyst for the OER. Utilizing 2‐ethyl imidazole as an etching reagent and the Ostwald ripening process enabled the evolution of nanomesh formation with a precise pore size of inkbottle shape. Material characterization confirmed the evolution of pore structure from layered double hydroxide‐like structure to hierarchical slit‐pores to uniform ink‐bottle pores after 24 h of synthesis with limited pore shrinkage attributable to iron redeposition at the pore entrances. AFM showed a gradual reduction in nanomesh thickness with an increase in synthesis time up to 24 h, indicative of successful exfoliation. The best catalyst (Co0.8Fe0.2(OH)x‐24h) was developed after 24 h of synthesis, having 3.8 nm ink‐bottle‐shaped pores on the basal plane of nanosheets with only 3‐4 layers. Co0.8Fe0.2(OH)x‐24h exhibited the best catalytic performance, characterized by a 330 mV overpotential, a mass activity of 309.1 A/g, and a turnover frequency of 2.28 s‐1. An increased electrochemical surface area (70.74 cm²) and a high roughness factor of approximately 1010 underlined the importance of narrow mesopores in facilitating catalyst‐electrolyte interactions and improving mass transport.

Stable porous manganese oxide-based electrodes are essential for clean energy generation and storage because of their high natural abundance and health safety. This investigation focuses on mesoporous LiMn2–xMxO4 (where M is Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu and x is 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.67) electrodes and thin/thick films. The mesoporous electrodes and films are fabricated by coating clear and homogeneous ethanol solutions of the salts (LiNO3, [Mn(OH2)4](NO3)2, and [M(OH2)x](NO3)2) and surfactants (P123 and CTAB) and calcining at elevated temperature (denoted as F-LiMn2–xMxO4, G-LiMn2–xMxO4, and meso-LiMn2–xMxO4, respectively). The electrochemical properties, stability, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the F/G-LiMn2–xMxO4 electrodes are investigated in alkaline media using a three electrode setup. The F-LiMn1.33M0.67O4 electrodes (where M is Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) exhibit low Tafel slopes of 60, 43, 44, and 32 mV/dec, respectively. While all the Mn-rich and F-LiMn2–xFexO4 electrodes degrade via Mn(VI) disproportionation reaction, the 33% Co electrode shows high stability during the OER. The nickel-based electrodes are stable with as little as 15% Ni and display excellent OER performance over 25% Ni, albeit undergoing a transformation that accumulates Ni(OH)2 species on the electrode surface. Copper in the F-LiMn2–xCuxO4 electrodes is homogeneous at low Cu percentages but forms a CuO phase above 15% Cu, undergoes degradation, and displays a weak OER performance. In short, Co and Ni stabilize the F-LiMn1.33Co0.67O4 and F-LiMn1.7Ni0.3O4 electrodes, which display excellent OER performance.

Ruthenium (Ru)‐ and iridium (Ir)‐based nanomaterials have always been regarded as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes. Herein, we develop a facile dodecylamine‐assisted hydrothermal synthesis for producing carbon‐supported IrRu alloy nanoparticles with controllable Ir/Ru ratios and ultrafine sizes towards high‐efficiency OER and overall water electrolysis. In this strategy, the dodecylamine that serves as a capping and reducing agent enables the final IrRu alloy nanoparticles to possess average sizes < 3 nm and high degree of dispersion on carbon substrate. By combining high OER activity of Ru with high acidic robustness of Ir, the as‐prepared IrRu/C nanoparticles at a suitable Ir/Ru ratio of 1/3 show good activity and durability for the OER electrocatalysis and overall water splitting. In specific, the Ir1Ru3/C catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential of 302 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm‐2 and the highest mass activity of 120.5 mA mg‐1 at 1.532 V for OER in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, a two‐electrode acidic electrolyzer assembled with Ir1Ru3/C at anode and commercial Pt/C at cathode (Pt/C|| Ir1Ru3/C) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.44 V for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm‐2, along with a satisfied 20‐h durability.

Development of highly active and stable acidic oxygen evolution reaction catalyst is very important for efficient water splitting while remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly ordered RuO2/WO3 inverse opals (IOs) catalyst to address the bottleneck problem of see-saw relationship between activity and stability, in which the crystalline and corrosionresistant WO3 facilitates electron transport and stabilizes RuO2, whereas the lattice mismatch-induced amorphousdominated RuO2 provides abundant unsaturated coordination sites to enhance the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Consequently, the RuO2/WO3 IOs demonstrates outstanding acidic OER performance in terms of a low overpotential of 180 mV to reach 10 mA·cm–2, and excellent stability for maintaining 100 hours continuous test. Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that interface coupling between WO3 and RuO2 can enhance the spin polarization of electrons and increase the overlaps of the electronic projected density of states between the Ru d orbitals of active metal and the O p orbitals of oxygen intermediates, facilitating OER pathway to switch from lattice oxygen mechanism to adsorbate evolution mechanism, which significantly decreases the reaction energy barrier of OER process. Meanwhile, the rich oxygen vacancies and WO3 supports in the heterostructures could inhibit the over-oxidation of Ru species, so as to enhance the activity and stability simultaneously.

Abstract The interfacial electric field ( IEF ) between heterogeneous units plays an important role in the electronic modulation of active centers during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the weak electronic coupling between spatially separated IEF s limits the deep activation of metal sites on the surface of the catalyst. Herein, a proof‐of‐concept strategy is provided that imbed MS 2 (M = Ni 3 Fe) species with high spin Fe orbits into heterogeneous units to promote the electron penetrating between IEF s. By designing a Fe 2 O 3 @MS/MS 2 @MO y model catalyst, the electronic interaction between adjacent IEF s is effectively enhanced for the deep oxidation of bimetals on the surface, breaking the competing relationship between adsorbed evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) of catalysts during OER. As a result, the onset overpotential of the synthesized electrode is only 171 mV, and it maintains excellent stability for more than 2300 h at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte.

Electrolysis of water is one of low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is designing and developing low-cost and high-activity catalysts. Herein, we present a strategy to fabricate flexible electrocatalysts based on nickel-iron (NiFe) alloy coatings. NiFe coatings were plated on the flexible copper-coated polyimide surface (Cu/PI) using the low-cost and straightforward electroless metal plating method and morpholine borane as a reducing agent. It was found that Ni90Fe10, Ni80Fe20, Ni60Fe40, and Ni30Fe70 coatings were deposited on the Cu/PI surface, then the concentration of Fe2+ in the plating solution was 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM, respectively. Morphology, structure, and composition of NixFey/Cu/PI catalysts have been examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), whereas their activity has been investigated for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in 1 M KOH using linear sweep voltammetry (LSVs). It was found that the Ni80Fe20/Cu/PI catalyst exhibited the lowest overpotential value of –202.7 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm–2 compared to Ni90Fe10/Cu/PI (–211.9 mV), Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI (–276.3 mV), Ni30Fe70/Cu/PI (–278.4 mV), and Ni (−303.4 mV). On the other hand, the lowest OER overpotential (344.7 mV) was observed for the Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI catalyst to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm–2 as compared with the Ni30Fe70 (369.9 mV), Ni80Fe20 (450.2 mV), Ni90Fe10 (454.2 mV) coatings, and Ni (532.1 mV). The developed Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI catalyst exhibit a cell potential of 1.85 V at 10 mA cm−2. The obtained catalysts seem to be suitable flexible catalysts for HER and OER in alkaline media.

In the pursuit of utilizing renewable energy sources for green hydrogen (H 2 ) production, alkaline water electrolysis has emerged as a key technology. To improve the reaction rates of overall water electrolysis and simplify electrode manufacturing, development of bifunctional electrocatalysts is of great relevance. Herein, CoPBO/Co 3 O 4 is reported as a binary composite catalyst comprising amorphous (CoPBO) and crystalline (Co 3 O 4 ) phases as a high‐performing bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water electrolysis. Owing to the peculiar properties of CoPBO and Co 3 O 4 , such as complementing Gibbs free energy values for H‐adsorption (Δ G H ) and relatively smaller difference in their work functions (ΔΦ), the composite exhibits H 2 spillover (HS) mechanism to facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The outcome is manifested in the form of a low HER overpotential of 65 mV (at 10 mA cm −2 ). Moreover, an abundant amount of surface oxygen vacancies (O v ) are observed in the same CoPBO/Co 3 O 4 composite that facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well, leading to a mere 270 mV OER overpotential (at 10 mA cm −2 ). The present work showcases the possibilities to strategically design non‐noble composite catalysts that combine the advantages of HS phenomenon as well as O v to achieve new record performances in alkaline water electrolysis.

Abstract Interface engineering is an efficient strategy to create high‐performance electrocatalysts for water splitting. In the present work, CeO 2 @CoSe 2 nanoneedle on carbon cloth (CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC) demonstrates high efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water splitting. CeO 2 with abundant O vacancies facilitates the adsorption of OH − and boosts the reconstruction of CoSe 2 into CoOOH at lower potentials. The in situ generated active CeO 2 @CoOOH heterointerface upshifts the d‐band center of Co site, thereby decreasing the free energy of rate‐determining step (RDS) ( * O to * OOH) during the OER process. It delivers a low OER overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm −2 . CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC is also found to be active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 138 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 ), profiting from CeO 2 ‐facilitated * H 2 O dissociation and * H adsorption on CoSe 2 . The overall water splitting is achieved over the CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC bifunctional electrode with a low electrolysis voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm −2 . This work offers valuable insights into CeO 2 ‐assisted surface reconstruction as well as provides water electrolysis catalysts through interface engineering.

Perovskite oxides have been extensively investigated as active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. While the OER activity of some perovskite oxides is positively influenced by Fe ions in the electrolyte, the impact of other transition metal ions in the electrolyte remains unclear. In this study, we compared the influence of Co ions intentionally added to the electrolyte on the OER activities of two Fe‐based perovskite oxides (Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3−δ and LaFeO3). While the OER activity of Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3−δ is significantly enhanced by adding Co ions to the electrolyte, LaFeO3 showed little difference in the OER behavior between the Co‐free and Co‐containing electrolytes. In the case of Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3−δ, an amorphous layer was formed, and the Co ions from the electrolyte were incorporated on the surface as a result of OER cycling. On the other hand, Co ions were also detected on the surface of LaFeO3, but its crystalline structure remains unchanged during the OER. Our study suggests that synergistic interplay between the perovskite oxides undergoing a structural transformation at the surface and transition metal ions in the electrolyte can improve the OER activity.

Oxygen evolution reactions (OER), commonly employed in applications such as metal-air batteries, water electrolysis, fuel cells, etc. , often suffer from slow kinetics, thus leading to ultra-high potentials that severely affect device energy efficiency. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered massive attention as electrodes for OER, benefiting from their highly ordered porous frameworks, abundant accessible active metal sites, and adjustable lattice structures. However, using powdered MOFs in OER poses a challenge, limiting the exposure of numerous active sites and resulting in suboptimal efficiency. To address this limitation, the trend towards designing MOF-based self-supported electrodes with enhanced contact between MOFs and the current collector has gained considerable attention for OER applications. This review highlights recent advancements and future prospects in developing MOF-based self-supported electrodes for OER. We delve into various aspects, including preparation methods, optimization strategies, catalytic efficiencies, and OER mechanisms with MOF-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, we explore the existing challenges associated with MOF-based self-supported electrodes for OER. This comprehensive overview provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of MOF-based materials in advancing OER.

Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high‐throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190 mV at 10 mA cm–2) with outstanding stability for over 170 h at 100 mA cm–2. Soft X‐ray absorption‐ and Raman‐spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope‐labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6 octahedrons to CrO4 tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non‐bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O–O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.

Abstract Nonprecious metal‐based 2D materials have shown promising electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the catalytically active sites of 2D materials are mainly presented at the edge, and most of their basal planes are still catalytically inactive, which turns into a significant drawback on the catalytic efficiency. Here, a novel p–n heterojunction strategy is suggested that generates active sites on the basal plane of 2D NiFe‐layered double hydroxide (NiFe‐LDH). The n‐type NiFe‐LDH is first grown on a nickel foam (NF) substrate, and p‐type Co 3 O 4 nanocubes are deposited through a simple dip‐coating method to fabricate a Co 3 O 4 /NiFe‐LDH@NF p–n heterojunction electrode. As a result, electron transfer is induced at the interface of p‐type Co 3 O 4 and n‐type NiFe‐LDH, which consequently promotes oxidation of the inert Ni 2+ state to a more catalytically active Ni 3+ state on the inert basal plane of NiFe‐LDH. As‐prepared Co 3 O 4 /NiFe‐LDH@NF electrodes obtained enhanced OER performance showing a high current density of 100 mA cm −2 at 1.48 V (vs RHE) which outperforms that of pristine NiFe‐LDH@NF. The utilization of the p–n junction concept will disclose a new strategy for modifying the electronic structure of the catalytically inactive basal plane and stimulating its electrocatalytic activity.

A comprehensive understanding of the electrode-electrolyte interface in energy conversion systems remains challenging due to the complex and multifaceted nature of interfacial processes. This complexity hinders the development of more efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to the theoretical description of the OER process on nickel-iron-based oxyhydroxides ($\gamma$-Ni$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$OOH) electrodes in alkaline media as a model system. Multiple reaction pathways represented by the single- and dual-site mechanisms were investigated by taking into account the realistic structure of the catalyst, the doping, and the solvation effects using a simple and computationally feasible strategy. Accounting for the variable solvation effects considerably affects the predicted overpotential in a roughly linear relationship between overpotential and dielectric constant. By incorporating quantum chemical simulations with kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that tuning the local solvation environment can significantly enhance the OER activity, opening new routine ways for elucidation of the emerging issues of OER processes on transition metal oxide surfaces and design of cost-effective, efficient electrocatalytic systems.

Abstract In recent years, there has been an increasing research focus on the luminol–H 2 O electrochemiluminescence (ECL) system due to its ability to address the instability and toxicity of H 2 O 2 , which are common issues associated with the conventional luminol–H 2 O 2 ECL system. To enhance the ECL efficiency of the luminol–H 2 O system, researchers have developed electrocatalytic materials with exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties to facilitate water electrolysis into O 2 to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and act as co‐reactant promoters. However, most of these materials are characterized by their nanoscale or microscale dimensions, resulting in relatively large sizes and low specific surface areas, which hinder the application of the luminol–H 2 O system. To address this challenge, nickel molybdate sub‐1 nm nanowires (NiMoO 4 S1 NWs) with a large specific surface area is synthesized that can offer many active sites to enhance the performance of the OER to boost the ECL of luminol. This study demonstrates that the large amount of ROS generated by the OER of NiMoO 4 S1 NWs play a crucial role in enhancing the ECL intensity of luminol. Finally, a NiMoO 4 S1 NWs‐based ECL biosensor for the highly sensitive detection of the nucleocapsid proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 is successfully constructed.

Abstract MXene, a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, presents promising applications in electrocatalysis. Maximizing its large surface area is key to developing efficient non‐noble‐metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, oxygen‐functionalized Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene (Ti 3 C 2 O x ) is synthesized and deposited gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto it, forming a novel composite material, Au‐Ti 3 C 2 O x . By selectively removing other functional groups, mainly ‐O functional groups are retained on the surface, directing electron transfer from Au NPs to MXene due to electronic metal‐support interaction (EMSI), thereby improving the catalytic activity of the MXene surface. Additionally, the interaction between Au NPs and ‐O functional groups further enhanced the overall catalytic activity, achieving an overpotential of 62 mV and a Tafel slope of 40.1 mV dec −1 at a current density of −10 mA cm −2 in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 solution. Density functional theory calculations and scanning electrochemical microscopy with ≤150 nm resolution confirmed the enhanced catalytic efficiency due to the specific interaction between Au NPs and Ti 3 C 2 O x . This work provides a surface modification strategy to fully utilize the MXene surface and enhance the overall catalytic activity of MXene‐based catalysts.

Abstract In oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the participation of lattice oxygen can break the limitation of adsorption evolution mechanism, but the activation of lattice oxygen remains a critical challenge. Herein, a surface fluorinated highly active 2D/2D FeNi layered double hydroxide/MXene (F‐LDH/MX) is demonstrated, boosting OER with the enhanced lattice‐oxygen‐mediated path. The introduction of fluorine promotes the self‐evolution of catalyst in an alkaline environment, even without an external current. It further accelerates the formation of active metal oxyhydroxides with abundant oxygen vacancies under the operating potential. The introduced oxygen vacancy activates the lattice oxygen, increasing the proportion of lattice oxygen mechanism in OER. Owing to the synergistic effects of the 2D/2D hierarchical structure and the modulated active surface, F‐LDH/MX possesses excellent electrochemical performances, including a low overpotential of 251 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , a low Tafel slope of 40.28 mV dec −1 , and robust stability. The water electrolyzer system with F‐LDH/MX as the anode offers the benchmark current density at a low cell voltage of 1.53 V, while the Zn‐air battery with F‐LDH/MX as the air electrode exhibits a higher power density of 75.43 mW cm −2 . This study presents a promising strategy to design highly active electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water electrolysis. Developing efficient and cost‐effective electrocatalysts is essential to achieve the commercialization of devices for the transition toward sustainable energy solutions. Herein, ternary layer double hydroxides (LDHs) are synthesized and characterized as electrocatalysts for OER using a potentiodynamic electrochemical deposition method on Grafoil. A chemometric approach based on experimental design is employed to rationalize the effort in the investigation of the LDHs which are based on Ni, Co, and Fe. The deposited films are characterized using cyclic voltammetry and X‐ray diffraction to determine peak currents and potentials, and crystal size. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst performances are assessed by linear sweep voltammetry in 1M KOH from which the Tafel slope and onset potential are calculated. The obtained data are used to derive models describing the material properties and electrocatalyst performance as a function of the electrolyte composition used during the LDHs electrodeposition. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between the electrocatalyst composition and its OER activity, enabling the design of more efficient and sustainable electrochemical systems for energy applications.

In order to create new value in biomass production using sterile Ulva with high production efficiency, we selected sterile Ulva with high culture stability from the coast of Imari City in Japan and investigated the conditions for generating high concentrations of dissolved oxygen through photosynthesis using the sterile Ulva . In the cultivation of sterile Ulva , we investigated the conditions for generating high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) by controlling conditions such as aeration, NO 3 ‐N concentration, and population density. As a result, we found that under the cultivation control conditions we found, DO reached about 3.8 times the saturation concentration after 3 h. It was found that this high level of DO can be maintained if the supersaturated DO seawater obtained here is properly sealed. Seawater containing high levels of DO is essential for the cultivation of oysters and shellfish, which also prefer a growth temperature of 20°C−25°C. Therefore, from the perspective of creating new value in biomass production, we developed a new system for simultaneously cultivating sterile Ulva and cultivating oysters.

Thin ﬁlms of bare and Se-containing tungsten trioxide (WO3) on AISI304 stainless steel were prepared by electrochemical deposition using peroxy-tungstate solutions. Cobalt-phosphate catalyst was photochemically deposited onto the surface of semiconductor particles in order to enhance their activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The photoelectrochemical properties of as-prepared electrodes were investigated in neutral 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions. The voltammetric characteristics revealed that the presence of cobalt-based catalyst effectively changes the photoelectrocatalytic activity of WO3 and Se-WO3 particles.

The development of high-entropy materials as active and durable catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is important but challenging for hydrogen production from water electrolysis. In contrast to conventional synthesis strategies that usually involve high-temperature annealing, a novel poly(ethylene glycol)-barbituric acid deep eutectic solvent-assisted strategy was developed in this work to successfully synthesize high-entropy nitrides (HENs) (FeCoNiCuZn)N at a record low temperature of 473 K. Multiple analytical characterizations illustrate that dual entropic and enthalpic forces provided by the poly(ethylene glycol)-barbituric acid deep eutectic solvent play a critical role in the low-temperature synthesis of HENs. The prepared HENs have a microsphere structure consisting of five highly dispersed active metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) species, which are conducive to boosting oxygen evolution reaction performance in alkaline media, in terms of a low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm⁻² and sustained durability over 30 hours at 400 mA cm⁻². This work paves the way for the fabrication of high-entropy materials with excellent electrocatalytic properties for future energy conversion and storage applications.

Abstract Doping guest elements is an effective way to increase activity and stability of RuO2 catalysts in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, due to the vastness of doping space, it is challenging for either high-cost experiments or density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen out the doped structures with the optimized catalytic performance. Herein, we reported a machine-learning (ML) framework that aims to realize high-throughput screening for both stability and activity of doped-RuO2 acidic OER catalysts from mono-doping to triple-doping at a low level of computational cost. Compared to the d-band theory and some other previous models, our ML model was constructed based on more general input features and realized higher prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.074, 0.142 and 0.082 eV for *OH, *O and *OOH adsorption, respectively. Through the ML models, three doping structures, Ru41Zn7O96, Ru41Zn4Fe3O96, and Ru39Zn4Cu4Co1O96 were found to possess the extraordinarily high stability and comparable or higher activity than the previously reported OER catalysts. This work provided an efficient study paradigm in fields of material screening and a useful guide for experimental synthesis.

Abstract The efficient anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is challenging with low cell voltage and long‐term stability at large current density, due to the unstable anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fe‐based electrocatalysts are potential candidates for the anodic OER. In Fe‐based materials, iron oxides always show better stability in alkaline solution but lower OER activity. However, the catalysts in previous study are difficult to continuously and effectively activate iron oxides supported on carbon during electrocatalysis. Herein, a new class of electrocatalyst: bamboo‐like carbon nanotubes (B‐CNT)‐encapsulated Fe 2 C nanoparticles (NPs) supported Fe 2 O 3 nanoclusters (NCs), named Fe 2 O 3 /B‐CNT@Fe 2 C is reported. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that B‐CNT‐encapsulate Fe 2 C NPs activate Fe 2 O 3 NCs by the d‐p‐d orbital coupling, thereby weakening the adsorption of OOH* intermediate during OER process. The electrolyzer based on the electrocatalyst requires only 1.48 V to reach 1.0 A cm −2 and shows a long‐term stability at 1.0 A cm −2 for 1600 h, comparable to the best‐reported values for the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE).

Abstract We efficiently synthesize magnesium copper phosphate nanoparticles (MgCuPO4) doped with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) using a hydrothermal method for supercapattery and oxygen evolution reactions in KOH electrolyte. The GQDs-MgCuPO4 electrode has a high specific capacity (1188 Cg-1 at 1.0 Ag-1) and a high-rate capability (67%). The symmetric supercapattery (GQDs-MgCuPO4/GQDs-MgCuPO4) provides a staggering energy density of 46 Wh-kg-1, as well as a high-power density of 1300 W-kg-1 and a high cyclic stability of 93% after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, it demonstrates high efficiency in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with corresponding low overpotentials of 181 mV and 119 mV. The GQDs-MgCuPO4 stands out as a capable solution for various energy storage and conversion difficulties.

NiFe (oxy)hydroxide has been widely used as a benchmark anodic catalyst for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in alkaline water electrolysis devices; however, the energy saving actually takes contributions from both the anodic OER and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, we observe the catalytic promotion upon the in situ-derived NiFe (oxy)hydroxide from the NiFe alloy monolithic electrode and also point out that the coupled nickel cathode is contaminated, leading to the loss of HER activity and a reduction in overall efficiency. It is found that Ni2+ and Fe3+ cations are inevitably detached from the anode into the electrolyte and electrodeposited on the nickel cathode after the three-month industrial simulation. This research presents the significant enhancement of the oxygen evolution catalysis using an in situ aging process and emphasizes that the catalytic application should not only be isolated on the half reaction, but a reasonable coupled electrode match to get rid of the contamination from the electrolyte is also of great significance to sufficiently present the intrinsic catalytic yielding for the real application.

Abstract Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) salts are extensively researched crystalline carbon nitride photocatalysts, but their photocatalytic water oxidation (PWO) performance is scarcely researched because of the difficulty in creating efficient active sites. Interference of metal ion (e.g., Na + and K + ) loss from the PHI salts in their PWO research has hardly been considered. Herein, metal single atom─OH (e.g., Co─OH) groups are incorporated into PHI to create efficient PWO active sites, via simple ion metathesis, hydrolysis, and deprotonation. The Co─OH modified PHI exhibits 9.3‐fold higher PWO (oxygen evolution) activity than PHI, with an external quantum yield reaching 0.44% even at 600 nm. Excluding interference of the metal ion loss, the function of the Co─OH incorporation is evidenced mainly to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction, as well as to promote photogenerated charge separation and raise visible light absorption, with the role of the OH especially revealed. Moreover, it is discovered that Na + loss from sodium PHI will decrease its PWO activity, protonation of PHI has a detrimental effect on its PWO performance, and some other metal single atom─OH incorporation in PHI can also enhance its PWO activity. Overall, this work provides a general way to create PWO active sites in PHI.

During the high-temperature oxygen evolution reaction for CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), the key elementary process of O2– transfer is restricted by the high anodic oxygen pressure thermodynamically, thus requiring a high external voltage [open-circuit voltage (OCV)] to drive the electrolysis reaction. Herein, electrochemical CH4 reforming is introduced to the SOEC anode, which remarkably lowers the anodic oxygen pressure and OCV, finally reducing the energy demand from 3.12 to 0.11 kW h per cubic meter of CO. Meanwhile, atomically dispersed Ru species is anchored on the anode surface due to the strong metal–support interaction, which exhibits superior CH4 reforming activity (90% of CO selectivity) and stability (300 h) to the infiltrated Ru nanoparticles and doped Ru species in the bulk lattice at 600 °C. This work proposes an efficient strategy to boost the SOEC performance thermodynamically and produce value-added chemicals at both the cathode and anode of SOEC simultaneously.

The acid-base microenvironment of the metal center is crucial for constructing advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, the correlation between acidic site and OER performance remains unclear for cobalt-based catalysts. Herein, Lewis acid sites in hollow cobalt phytate micropolyhedra (M-CoPA, M = Cu, Sr) were synthesized by a cation-exchange strategy, and their OER performances were studied systematically. Experimentally, Lewis acid Cu2+ sites with stronger Lewis acidity exhibited superior intrinsic activity and long-term stability in alkaline electrolytes. The spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show Lewis acid sites in hollow cobalt phytate micropolyhedra can modulate the electronic distribution of the adjacent cobalt center and further optimize the adsorption strength of oxygenated species. This study figures out the effect of Lewis acid sites on the OER kinetics and provides an effective way to develop high-efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion systems.

The design and development of highly active non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for metal-air batteries. In this work, the electrocatalytic performance of different p-block metal (PM = Sn, Sb, Pb and Bi) atoms embedded in the g-CN monolayer (PMx@g-CN, x = 1–3) for the OER and ORR was systematically investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The strong interaction between PMx atoms and g-CN substrates indicates the good stability of PMx@g-CN catalysts. Among all the designed catalysts, Bi3@g-CN is found to be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the OER and ORR with the calculated overpotential ηOER and ηORR of 0.23 and 0.25 V, respectively. With the atomic active sites of PMx increasing from x = 1 to 3, the OER and ORR catalytic activity is enhanced. The correlations between the overpotentials of the OER/ORR and Bader charge values of the anchored PMx atoms of the catalysts were established. Our findings contribute to searching for noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts and shed light on the rational design of atomic active sites on electrocatalysts.

Hydrogen has the potential to decarbonize the energy and industrial sectors in the future, mainly if it is generated by water electrolysis. The proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) system is regarded as a propitious technology to produce green hydrogen from water using power supplied by renewable energy sources. It offers many benefits, such as high performance, high proton conductibility, quick response, compact size, and low working temperature. Many conceptual and functional parameters influence the effectiveness of PEM, including temperature, pressure of anode and cathode regions, water content and wideness of the layer, and cathode and anode exchange current density. In addition, the anodic half-reaction (known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) and cathodic half-reaction (known as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) perform an important function in the development of PEMWE. The current study aims to present these parameters and discuss their impacts on the performance of PEM. Also, the PEM efficiency is presented. The different methods used to enhance the scattering of OER electrocatalysts and minimize catalyst loading to minimize the price of PEMWE are also highlighted. Moreover, the alternative noble metals that could be used as electrocatalysts in HER and OER to minimize the cost of PEM are reviewed and presented.

The interaction between interfacial water and transition metal oxides is a primary enabling step for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). RuO2 is a prototypical OER electrocatalyst whose ability to activate interfacial water molecules is essential to its OER activity. We image the dissociation of surface water into OH* and O* on RuO2(110), where * denotes adsorbed species, using atomic force microscopy. Starting from the surface-bound water molecules, which form a one-dimensional network along the rows of Ru surface sites, increasing the oxidative potential strips hydrogen away and transforms the water molecules into OH* and O*. This oxidative step changes the pattern of the adsorbates from one- to two-dimensional. First-principles calculations with interfacial polarization, capacitive charging, and adsorbate interactions attribute this evolution to the cooperative dehydrogenation of adsorbed water and OH* on RuO2. We use these results to map the surface phase diagram of RuO2(110) and provide a quantitative interpretation of its cyclic voltammetry. Our result provides the visualization of the water dissociation on a conductive oxide surface, a critical step in the OER, and demonstrates that the water activation is a collective phenomenon at RuO2(110) electrodes.

The practical application of rechargeable zinc-air batteries faces challenges stemming from inadequate bifunctional catalysts, contradictory gas-liquid-solid three-phase interfaces, and an ambiguous fundamental understanding. Herein, we propose a chameleon-like bifunctional catalyst comprising ruthenium single-atoms grafted onto nickel-iron layer double hydroxide (RuSA-NiFe LDH). The adaptive oxidation of RuSA-NiFe LDH to oxyhydroxide species (RuSA-NiFeOOH) during charging exposes active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction, while reversible reduction to NiFe LDH during discharge exposes active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction. Additionally, a hierarchical air cathode featuring hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers facilitates the reversible conversion between RuSA-NiFe LDH and RuSA-NiFeOOH, expedites oxygen bubble desorption, and suppresses carbon corrosion. Consequently, our zinc-air batteries demonstrate a high charge/discharge capacity of 100 mAh cm−2 per cycle, a voltage gap of 0.67 V, and an extended cycle life of 2400 h at 10 mA cm−2. We comprehensively elucidate the catalytic reaction thermodynamics and kinetics for the air cathode through electrode potential decoupling monitoring, oxygen bubble desorption tracking, and carbon content quantification. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries hold great promise for energy storage but face several challenges. In this study, the authors introduce a chameleon-like catalyst and a hierarchical air cathode, achieving a 2400-hour cycle life for these batteries.

Designing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is crucial for green hydrogen production via the water‐splitting system. The bifunctional electrocatalyst offers a promising strategy due to the simplified preparation process and reduced expenses. However, the single‐component bifunctional catalysts often struggle to match the redox potential of water and to achieve proper adsorption/desorption of Gibbs free energy for both H and O intermediates simultaneously. Herein, through precisely controlling the topological transformation path of the RuNiOx precursor, we successfully prepared high‐performance RuNi/Ni and Ru/NiO heterostructure electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, respectively. The energy level matching between the fabricated electrocatalyst and water oxidation/reduction potential confirms the feasibility of HER and OER. The synergistic effect between the active sites ensures rapid, intermediate adsorption/desorption kinetics. As a result, the assembled alkaline overall water splitting setup achieves a current density of 1 A cm‐2 at 2 V and maintains stable operation at 100 mA cm‐2 for 100 hours.

Comprehensive Summary Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted significant attention due to their high atomic utilization and tunable coordination environment. However, the catalytic mechanisms related to the active center and coordination environment remain unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities of NiN 4 , NiN 3 , NiN 3 H 2 , NiN 4 X, NiN 3 X, and NiN 3 H 2 X (X denotes axial ligand) through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study unveils two distinct reaction pathways for ORR and OER, involving proton‐electron pairs adsorbed from both the solution and the catalyst surface. The overpotential is the key parameter to evaluate the catalytic performance when proton‐electron pairs are adsorbed from the solution. NiN 3 and NiN 3 H 2 show promise as pH‐universal bifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER. On the other hand, when proton‐electron pairs are adsorbed from the catalyst surface, the reaction energy barrier becomes the crucial metric for assessing catalytic activity. Our investigation reveals that NiN 3 H 2 consistently exhibits optimal ORR activity across a wide pH range, regardless of the source of proton‐electron pair (solvent or catalyst surface).

A promising potential new electrocatalyst for water splitting could be developed through the meticulous design and synthesis of diverse bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). These MOFs would use different or the same metals from the d and f blocks and could have different oxidation states. This study focuses on developing an efficient bimetallic electrocatalyst, based on the rare-earth lanthanide series element europium (Eu) and transition-metal copper (Cu) as the MOF using a one-pot hydrothermal method. As a result, a significant 4f–3d heterovalent heterobimetallic MOF was obtained, and its electrocatalytic activity toward water splitting was evaluated. Further, heterobimetallic MOFs with their mixed valence display an improved water-splitting performance through synergistic effects. Linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) studies reveal that the bimetallic Eu–Cu-MOF required an overpotential of 133 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 240 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 20 mA cm–2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, the long-term stability study exhibits a stable nature up to 20 and 16 h in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions, respectively. The incorporation of Eu synergistically increases the adsorption and desorption ability of OH– and O2 molecules toward OER, respectively. The bimetallic MOF displayed excellent stability under acidic as well as alkaline conditions, indicating an exciting future for Eu–Cu-MOF in the field of electrochemical water splitting.

Abstract The development of a nonnoble metal‐based cost‐effective, efficient, and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst is crucial to achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. In this study, a structural and interfacial engineering approach is employed to design a 2D–2D hierarchical nickel MOF/nickel hydroxide‐derived nickel selenide/nickel telluride dual‐phase material through a single‐step selenotellurization process. The rational design of highly ordered nanoarchitectures provides well‐defined voids and ample pathways for ion diffusion. Furthermore, hierarchical nickel selenide/nickel telluride works synergistically at heterojunctions, providing a local ion enrichment mechanism for the catalytic process. As a result, Ni 0.85 Se/NiTe 2 @Ni‐NH@CC needs an overpotential of 69 and 240 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm −2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, with an outstanding stability observed for over 100 h. Moreover, the Ni 0.85 Se/NiTe 2 @Ni‐NH@CC (+, −) device exhibits excellent overall water‐splitting performance with a cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm −2 and can be operated steadily for >100 h at 100 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate favorable kinetics for H‐adsorption at the selenotelluride heterojunction, thereby promoting the HER. This work highlights a new approach for designing a unique nanoarchitecture of MOF/hydroxide‐derived selenotelluride heterojunctions for high‐efficiency energy conversion applications.

This study explores the enhancement of α-Fe2O3 (hematite) nanorod arrays for photoelec-trochemical applications by constructing a Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) heterojunction. While α-Fe2O3 offers good stability, a low cost, and environmental benefits, its efficiency is limited by slow oxygen evolution kinetics, high carrier recombination rates, and low conductivity. By introducing CZTS, a material with strong light absorption and charge transport properties, we enhance the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, reduce charge transfer resistance, and increase the carrier concentration, thereby boosting the overall photoelectrochemical performance. The experimental results show that a modified FC-15 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 3.40 mA/cm2 at 1.60 V vs. RHE, a substantial increase compared to 0.40 mA/cm2 for unmodified α-Fe2O3. Band gap analysis reveals a reduced band gap in the FC-15 material, enhancing light absorption and boosting the photoelectrocatalytic performance. In photoelectrochemical water-splitting tests, the FC-15 photoanode achieves a hydrogen production rate of 41.6 μmol/cm2/h, which is significantly improved over the unmodified sample at 5.64 μmol/cm2/h. These findings indicate that the CZTS/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction effectively promotes charge separation, enhances charge transport, and improves light absorption, substantially increasing photocatalytic efficiency. This heterojunction approach offers new insights and technical strategies for developing photocatalytic materials with potential applications in renewable energy.

The primary obstacle in electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen (H2) production is the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, a promising approach to overcome this barrier involves replacing the OER with the more energetically favorable methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), providing a practical avenue for efficient and energy-saving H2 generation. This paper proposes a bifunctional electrocatalyst, successfully synthesizing a trimetallic hybrid NiCoMg-LDH composite via a one-step hydrothermal method supported on 3-DCF (carbon felt). Additionally, the stability of the electrolyzer was assessed by the statistical modeling and predictive time series analysis (LSTM) technique. The synthesized multimetallic self-supported NiCoMg-LDH composition formed porous hexagonal sheet-like structures, demonstrating outstanding bifunctional activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER, achieving low overpotentials of 0.185 and 0.161 V for HER and OER at an applied current density of 100 mA/cm2, respectively. Additionally, when employed parallel as the anode and cathode for total water splitting, it necessitated only 1.56 V to achieve 100 mA/cm2, surpassing the compared benchmark Pt/C∥RuO2 electrodes. Furthermore, the cell voltage of the NiCoMg-LDH∥NiCoMg-LDH-based methanol–water electrolyzer at 100 mA/cm2 was notably reduced by 250 mV compared to that of the OER alone at the anode. Therefore, from these results, the superior electroactivity of the trimetallic NiCoMg-LDH catalyst is primarily attributed to its high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), abundant active sites, and rapid electron transfer from the catalyst surface to the electrolyte. Therefore, this study represents a significant advancement in the design and development of stable, highly active, and economical hybrid catalysts for green energy harvesting applications.

Understanding the dehydrogenation of transition metal oxide surfaces under electrochemical potential is critical to the control of important chemical processes such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using first principles computations, we model the thermodynamic dehydrogenation process on RuO$_2$(110) and compare the results to experimental cyclic voltammetry (CV) on single crystal. We use a cluster expansion model trained on *ab initio* energy data coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to derive the macroscopic electrochemical observables, i.e., experimental CV, from the energetics of different hydrogen coverage microstates on well-defined RuO$_2$(110). Our model reproduces the unique "two-peaks" cyclic voltammogram observed experimentally with current density peak positions and shapes in good qualitative agreement. We show that RuO$_2$(110) starts as a water-covered surface with hydrogen on bridge (BRG) and coordination-unsaturated sites (CUS) at low potential (less than 0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). As the potential increases, the hydrogens on BRG desorb, becoming the main contributor to the first CV peak with smaller contributions from CUS. When all BRG hydrogens are desorbed (before 1.2 V vs. RHE), the remaining CUS hydrogens desorb abruptly in a very small potential window leading to the sharp second peak observed during CV. Our work shows that above 1.23 V, the OER proceeds on a fully dehydrogenated RuO$_2$(110) surface.

Abstract Zn‐CO 2 batteries (ZCBs) are promising for CO 2 conversion and electric energy release. However, the ZCBs couple the electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECO 2 R) with the oxygen evolution reaction and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, which normally causes ultrahigh charge voltage and CO 2 conversion efficiency attenuation, thereby resulting in ~90% total power consumption. Herein, isolated FeN 3 sites encapsulated in hierarchical porous carbon nanoboxes (Fe‐HPCN, derived from the thermal activation process of ferrocene and polydopamine‐coated cubic ZIF‐8) were proposed for hydrazine‐assisted rechargeable ZCBs based on ECO 2 R (discharging process: CO 2 + 2H + → CO + H 2 O) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, charging process: N 2 H 4 + 4OH − → N 2 + 4H 2 O + 4e − ). The isolated FeN 3 endows the HzOR with a lower overpotential and boosts the ECO 2 R with a 96% CO Faraday efficiency (FE CO ). Benefitting from the bifunctional ECO 2 R and HzOR catalytic activities, the homemade hydrazine‐assisted rechargeable ZCBs assembled with the Fe‐HPCN air cathode exhibited an ultralow charge voltage (decreasing by ~1.84 V), excellent CO selectivity (FE CO close to 100%), and high 89% energy efficiency. In situ infrared spectroscopy confirmed that Fe‐HPCN can generate rate‐determining *N 2 and *CO intermediates during HzOR and ECO 2 R. This paper proposes FeN 3 centers for bifunctional ECO 2 R/HzOR performance and further presents the pioneering achievements of ECO 2 R and HzOR for hydrazine‐assisted rechargeable ZCBs.

LOCALIZED CORROSION OF ALUMINUM IN AERATED ENVIRONMENTS AND IN ENVIRONMENTS WITH LOW OXYGEN CONTENT: STUDY AND COMPARISON THROUGH POLARIZATION CURVES. In this study, the influence of deaeration on the electrochemical behavior of aluminum was studied by polarization techniques. The advantages of deaeration for the evaluation of localized corrosion on aluminum are discussed. The influence of the corrosive environment with low oxygen contents on the electrochemical response of aluminum was evaluated by anodic and cathodic potentiodynamic polarization curves. The polarization tests were carried out in chloride solutions followed by optical and scanning electron microscopy characterization. It was observed that deaeration of the solution significantly influences the electrochemical behavior of aluminum, as predicted by corrosion kinetics theories. For the cathodic curves, a decrease in the limiting current density for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was observed for low oxygen solutions, while the “apparent” initiation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was shifted to higher potentials. In the anodic curves, a common passive behavior was not observed in aerated conditions, however, at the corrosion potential, localized pitting was observed indicating that the material was already above the breakdown potential (Ebr). In the low oxygen content solution, however, a passive region with a breakdown potential, was observed on the anodic curves.

Abstract Lutao is an islet off the eastern coast of the main island of Taiwan and is composed of pyroclastic agglomerates, volcanic breccias, lava flows, and dykes. There have been no reports of SIMS zircon oxygen isotopic data from Lutao Island so far, which has significantly hampered further understanding of its magmatic processes, such as crystallization, evolution, and generation of magma. In this study, we use zircon U–Pb dating, Lu–Hf and O isotopic analysis to constrain the age, origin, and magmatic processes of the volcanic rocks from Lutao Island. Integration of our new U–Pb and Hf–O isotope data with available published data allows us to better assess the timing and magmatic processes of Lutao Island in the context of the northern Luzon arc system. This work is the first report of SIMS zircon oxygen isotopic data of volcanic rocks from Lutao island. This study shows that the volcanic rocks from Lutao Island were generated by mantle-derived magma associated with high-T° hydrothermal alteration by seawater-derived fluids.

In order to investigate the internal mechanism and the variation law of capacity attenuation of LIBs, a simplified electrochemical model of the LIBs was established using the nickel-cobalt-aluminum LIBs as the research object, and the aging model of solid electrolyte interface SEI growth and lithium evolution was added to simulate the electrochemical behavior of the batteries. The results showed that the porosity of the anode/diaphragm reduced continually at the start of the cycle, while the SEI film grew continuously. The loss of active materials accelerated as the number of cycles increased, while the side reaction of lithium development continued. Finally, the aging mechanism was confirmed by using microscopic morphology. The results show that the negative particles are obviously crushed and contain white deposited substances. The formation of these compounds increases the oxygen content, reduces the carbon content, reduces the porosity of the electrode, increases the overpotential of the electrolyte transport, and becomes the main reason for the attenuation of the battery life. Finally, the positive particles expand and break, which leads to the sudden reduction of the battery capacity. This study determined the evolution process of aging mechanism in the whole life cycle, and provided a theoretical basis for the establishment of mechanism aging model.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to excellent stability and low cost. However, the utilization in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution is constrained by inherent shortcomings, including fewer edge active sites, poor dispersion, and electrical conductivity. In this work, MoS2 was compounded with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are known for their high specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity. These CNTs, laden with oxygen-containing functional groups, provided nucleation sites that facilitated the rapid assembly of MoS2 nanoflowers under hydrothermal conditions within 3 h. Due to their diminutive size (∼300 nm), these nanoflowers possess a large specific surface area and numerous active sites at their edges. Furthermore, MoS2 nanoflowers exhibited a high concentration of intrinsic S-vacancies. This heterojunction material exhibited superior HER properties. In addition, density functional theory simulation further confirmed that the MoS2 with S vacancy and CNT heterojunction electrocatalysts (VS-M/C) provided a fast charge transfer pathway for water electrolysis, and analysis showed that the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum were mainly contributed by the d orbits of Mo and the p orbits of C. This study proffered a novel approach for the engineering of high-performance MoS2-based HER electrocatalysts.

This article presents a comprehensive study on the streamer propagation and electric field distribution within a two-dimensional fluid model of a packed bed reactor (PBR) filled with carbon dioxide, utilizing the PASSKEy simulation platform. The research delves into the spatiotemporal evolution of electron density, electric fields and key plasma species in the discharge process. The model simulates a PBR with layered dielectric spheres, indicates that the inner sides of the first and second layers of dielectric spheres are not the primary regions for reactions such as CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation; instead, the main regions are along the streamer propagation path and the outer side of the first layer of dielectric spheres. The study by examining the propagation of streamers in the presence of an electric field, highlighting the influence of anode voltage rise and dielectric polarization on local electric field enhancement. This enhancement leads to increased electron density and temperature, facilitating streamer propagation and the formation of filamentary microdischarges and surface ionization waves. The article provides a detailed analysis of the local electric field evolution at specific points within the PBR. The research further investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of spatial and surface charges, revealing that negative charges concentrate within the streamer and on the dielectric surface, with densities significantly higher than positive charges. The positive charges' distribution is closely related to the streamer's path, and over time, they come to dominate the charge distribution in the discharge space. The study also explores the surface charge deposition on the dielectric spheres, discusses the evolution trends of the distribution. Additionally, the article discusses the temporal and spatial evolution of key plasma species, including ions and radicals, and their contribution to the overall discharge characteristics. The production mechanisms of carbon monoxide particles, carbon dioxide ions, and oxygen ions are analyzed, with a focus on their spatial distribution and correlation with electron density. The study concludes with an examination of the energy deposition within the PBR, integrating the spatial energy deposition of electrons and major positive ions. The results indicate a total energy deposition value of approximately 1.428 mJ/m, with carbon dioxide ions accounting for 8.8% of this value.

Carbon, with its high electrical conductivity and large surface area, enables the efficient dispersion and utilization of catalytic entities, contributing to the cost-effective development of electrochemical systems for a future energy economy. However, the longevity of these systems is often compromised by carbon corrosion, the fundamental details of which unfortunately remain largely unknown. Here, we elucidate that carbon corrosion is initiated by a covalent addition reaction that chemically breaks the sp2 carbon network, prior to electrochemical oxidation steps. Online differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and post-mortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy unveil the pseudozeroth- and first-order reaction kinetics in the proton concentration and oxygen coverage on the carbon surface, respectively, allowing us to suggest acid-catalyzed hydration with carbocation formation as the initial step in carbon corrosion. The proposed mechanism is further evidenced by the decreased carbon corrosion rate in the presence of the carbocation scavenger, methanol, and by the evolution of the C18O16O product during the corrosion of carbon, pretreated in acid solution prepared with the 18O-isotope of water. Based on these findings, previous empirical understandings, pH-dependent and site-specific (defect, edge, etc.) carbon corrosion characteristics, can be successfully explained, bringing potential avenues for developing rational strategies to mitigate carbon corrosion.

The origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs (WDs) remains mysterious. Magnetic WDs are traditionally associated with field strengths $\gtrsim1\,\mathrm{MG}$, set by the sensitivity of typical spectroscopic magnetic field measurements. Informed by recent developments in red giant magnetoasteroseismology, we revisit the use of WD pulsations as a seismic magnetometer. WD pulsations primarily probe near-surface magnetic fields, whose effect on oscillation mode frequencies is to asymmetrize rotational multiplets and, if strong enough, suppress gravity-mode propagation altogether. The sensitivity of seismology to magnetic fields increases strongly with mode period and decreases quickly with the depth of the partial ionization-driven surface convective zone. We place upper limits for magnetic fields in $24$ pulsating WDs: $20$ hydrogen-atmosphere (DAV) and three helium-atmosphere (DBV) carbon-oxygen WDs, and one extremely low-mass (helium-core) pulsator. These bounds are typically $\sim1$-$10\,\mathrm{kG}$, although they can reach down to $\sim10$-$100\,\mathrm{G}$ for DAVs and helium-core WDs in which lower-frequency modes are excited. Seismic magnetometry may enable new insights into the formation and evolution of WD magnetism.

Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) is a severe late-stage complication of radiotherapy (RT) to the chest area, typically used in lung cancer treatment. This condition is characterized by the gradual and irreversible replacement of healthy lung tissue with fibrous scar tissue, leading to decreased lung function, reduced oxygen exchange and critical respiratory deficiencies. Currently, predicting and managing lung fibrosis post-RT remains challenging, with limited preventive and treatment options. Accurate prediction of fibrosis onset and progression is therefore clinically crucial. We present a personalized in silico model for pulmonary fibrosis that encompasses tumour regression, fibrosis development and lung tissue remodelling post-radiation. Our continuum-based model was developed using data from 12 RT-treated lung cancer patients and integrates computed tomography (CT) and dosimetry data to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of fibrosis. We demonstrate the ability of the in silico model to capture the extent of fibrosis in the entire cohort with a less than 1% deviation from clinical observations, in addition to providing quantitative metrics of spatial similarity. These findings underscore the potential of the model to improve treatment planning and risk assessment, paving the way for more personalized and effective management of RIPF.

Desert environments harbor unique microbial communities. This study focuses on Cellulosimicrobium funkei isolate RVMD1, isolated from rock varnish in the Ma’an Desert. Initial identification was achieved using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for comprehensive characterization. The genome comprises 4,264,015 base pairs (857 contigs) with a high G + C content of 74.59%. A total of 4,449 proteins were predicted. Comparative analysis utilizing OrthoANI, ANI, AAI, and dDDH metrics suggests that RVMD1 belongs to the C. cellulans group, with the highest similarity to C. funkei (97.71% ANI). Phylogenomic analysis of 43 Cellulosimicrobium genomes revealed significant heterogeneity within the genus. Our results challenge current systematics, with C. cellulans potentially representing up to 9 distinct genomospecies. Isolate RVMD1 shows genetic adaptations to its desert environment, including genes for denitrification, oxygen and sulfur cycling, and diverse hydrogen metabolism. Pangenomic analysis uncovered a considerable number of unique genes within RVMD1, highlighting its genetic distinctiveness. Gene family expansions suggest evolution in response to stressors like UV radiation and nutrient limitation. This study represents the first whole-genome analysis of a bacterium isolated from Jordanian rock varnish, emphasizing the value of WGS in understanding microbial diversity and adaptation in extreme environments.

Abstract Hydrogen‐terminated 2D–Germanane (2D–GeH), a germanium‐based 2D material akin to graphene, is receiving enormous attention owing to its predicted optoelectronic characteristics. However, experimental research of 2D–GeH is still in an early stage, and therefore its real implementation for task‐specific applications will depend on the correct development of suitable chemical functionalization methods. Herein, a general and straightforward organometallic (OM) approach is provided for the robust functionalization of 2D–GeH with different 0D noble metal nanoparticles (M–NPs), resulting in 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics. As a proof‐of‐principle, 0D/2D Pt@GeH and Au@GeH nanoarchitectonics have been successfully synthesized, characterized, and explored as unconventional electrocatalysts for boosting energy conversion reactions. While the hydrogen evolution reaction activity was evaluated for Pt@GeH, the oxygen reduction reaction was interrogated for Au@GeH. Interestingly, the implanted catalytic features of M–NPs yielded to 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics with enhanced energy conversion activity comparing to pristine 2D–GeH counterpart. This work proves the suitability of 2D–GeH as unconventional substrates to stabilize nobleM−NPs, and the versatility of the OM approach for the custom design of a new family of 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics to expand the implementation of monoelemental 2D materials as promising electrocatalysts in energy conversion field and beyond.

Abstract The Afar region is one of the only places on Earth where magmatic continental rifting and associated ongoing break-up processes are exposed onshore. The several active magmatic segments there are characterized by contrasted morphologies, crustal thicknesses, magma production rates, and magma-tectonic styles. In the Erta Ale Range rift segment, extension is magmatically accommodated, making the range the ideal place to study the magmatic behavior of a mature rift segment. Erta Ale Range comprises sub-segments with magma compositions ranging from basalts to rhyolites, but only the Erta Ale Volcano (EAV) sub-segment is active, where only basaltic compositions have been reported so far. Here, we show for the first time protracted differentiation at EAV that is not expressed volcanically at the surface, but is rather accessible via unique cognate gabbroic and microgabbroic blocks, and recorded by mixing with erupted basaltic magmas. These cognate samples record previously unknown mushy and evolved parts of the EAV plumbing system. To constrain their origin and evolution, we measured the major and trace element compositions of the bulk rocks, interstitial glasses, and melt inclusions. We also measured the oxygen isotopic compositions of olivine crystals, interstitial glasses, and melt inclusions. By combining these results with textural relationships and oxy-thermo-barometry calculations, we discuss magma differentiation and storage conditions, as well as magmatic interactions during transport through the crust. Comparison of our results with rhyolite-MELTS thermodynamic models highlights that protracted fractional crystallization is the main process of magma evolution, and when associated with reactive porous flow is capable of forming the evolved compositions observed (up to 75 wt.% SiO2). We also use the model outputs to quantify distinct steps of igneous differentiation in both shallow and deep crustal reservoirs, and we highlight significant interactions with hydrothermally altered wall rocks. We discuss this model within the geological contexts of the Erta Ale Range rift segment and the larger Afar region, and highlight contrasts with mature oceanic systems to argue that the region is not in the final stages of continental break-up.

Abstract. Iodine (I) abundance in marine carbonates (measured as an elemental ratio with calcium, I / Ca) is of broad interest as a proxy for local/regional ocean redox. This connection arises because the speciation of iodine in seawater, the balance between iodate (IO3-) and iodide (I−), is sensitive to the prevalence of oxic vs. anoxic conditions. However, although I / Ca ratios are increasingly commonly being measured in ancient carbonate samples, a fully quantitative interpretation of this proxy requires the availability of a mechanistic interpretative framework for the marine iodine cycle that can account for the extent and intensity of ocean deoxygenation in the past. Here we present and evaluate a representation of marine iodine cycling embedded in an Earth system model (“cGENIE”) against both modern and paleo-observations. In this framework, we account for IO3- uptake and release of I− through the biological pump, the reduction in ambient IO3- to I− in the water column, and the re-oxidation of I− to IO3-. We develop and test a variety of different plausible mechanisms for iodine reduction and oxidation transformation and contrast model projections against an updated compilation of observed dissolved IO3- and I− concentrations in the present-day ocean. By optimizing the parameters controlling previously proposed mechanisms involved in marine iodine cycling, we find that we can obtain broad matches to observed iodine speciation gradients in zonal surface distribution, depth profiles, and oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs). However, we also identify alternative, equally well performing mechanisms which assume a more explicit mechanistic link between iodine transformation and environment – an ambiguity that highlights the need for more process-based studies on modern marine iodine cycling. Finally, to help distinguish between competing representations of the marine iodine cycle and because our ultimate motivation is to further our ability to reconstruct ocean oxygenation in the geological past, we conducted “plausibility tests” of different model schemes against available I / Ca measurements made on Cretaceous carbonates – a time of substantially depleted ocean oxygen availability compared to modern and hence a strong test of our model. Overall, the simultaneous broad match we can achieve between modeled iodine speciation and modern observations, and between forward proxy modeled I / Ca and geological elemental ratios, supports the application of our Earth system modeling in simulating the marine iodine cycle to help interpret and constrain the redox evolution of past oceans.

Abstract Minerals with compositional zoning in volcanic products are widely used to decipher the history of magmatic evolution. However, structural information, which reflects physical conditions and crystallization equilibrium, has often been overlooked. This study presents the first report on the structural zoning of deep‐derived biotite phenocrysts through investigations of metaluminous rhyolite from Long Valley, CA. Biotite is enriched in Si, Mg, and K and depleted in Fe 3+ , Ti, and Al IV in core zones compared with rims. In situ structural analyses, including micro X‐ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, were conducted to identify cores with perfect 2 M 1 polytype and disordered rims of biotite. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in revealing various (micro)polytypes of a single species, which occur at different crystallization temperatures, pressures, supersaturation levels, and oxygen fugacities. The concept of structural zoning is introduced here to describe the different structural features distributed systematically in various parts of minerals. By combining structural and chemical zoning, we illustrate a two‐step growth for samples: equilibrium crystallization of the highly ordered cores in a deep magma reservoir with high temperature and pressure, followed by rapid growth of disordered rims during magma mixing in a crystal mush. We further discuss the implications of these findings for reflecting the plumbing system structure and eruption history of rhyolitic magma over extended periods. Our study underscores the remarkable sensitivity of structural zoning in delineating the crystallization conditions of minerals and documenting the environmental changes within magma.

The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of these disks. The winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the and lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas that of is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. The peak emission is compatible with the stellar location in all cases, apart from one target with high relative inclination with respect to the ionizing radiation, where the peak emission is located at the disk edge in the direction of the ionizing radiation. To verify whether the line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examined VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the and 6300 lines are well detected in all these targets, the total detection rate is $ in the case of the line. This number increases substantially to a $ detection rate in sigma -Orionis, a region with higher UV radiation than in low-mass SFRs, but lower than in the ONC. The spatial location of the line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-tale tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.

(1−3) Professor Haoshen Zhou from Nanjing University, China, has been selected as the 2024 PIER in the field of batteries and energy storage for his outstanding contribution to the area of high energy density secondary battery materials and systems. (4) We are honored to have the opportunity to celebrate his outstanding contributions in this special issue (SI).Professor Haoshen Zhou received his bachelor's degree in semiconductor physics from the Department of Physics at Nanjing University in 1985, master's degree in 1988 from the Nanjing Institute of Electronic Devices, and Ph.D. in chemical engineering in the School of Engineering at The University of Tokyo, Japan, in 1994. After his Ph.D. study, he pursued a further 3 years of postdoctoral training at RIKEN in Japan. In 1997, Professor Haoshen Zhou joined the Energy Interface Department of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, to pursue energy-related scientific research. He was promoted to a professor-level senior researcher in 2004 and became the chief senior researcher in AIST's Energy Department in 2011. During his tenure in Japan, Professor Zhou led numerous projects funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and the Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO). In 2012, he joined Nanjing University's College of Engineering and Applied Sciences as a full professor. Professor Zhou established the Department of Energy Science and Engineering and Center of Energy Storage Materials & Technology, where he served as their inaugural chairs. He was also appointed as a Yangtse Distinguished Professor by the Chinese Ministry of Education (2010). He held concurrent appointments as a special professor at The University of Tokyo and University of Tsukuba in Japan. Professor Zhou has served as an associate editor of Science Bulletin and Energy Storage Materials as well as an expert in charge of the National Key R&D Program's "Smart Grid Key Project" in China. During 2014–2018, he was the chief scientist for China's National Key Research Program in Nanotechnology. Professor Zhou received the "Lihua Yi" Chemical Innovation Award from the Chinese Chemical Society (2023) and the First Prize from the Chinese Materials Research Society (2024). Over his career, Professor Zhou has mentored more than 80 postdoctoral fellows and doctoral students, of which many have grown into emerging leaders in their respective research areas.Professor Haoshen Zhou has long been dedicated to the innovation and engineering of new high-energy-density battery systems and key materials. He established the reaction theory for high-capacity air electrodes, invented solid-state batteries based on sieving electrolytes, and developed and expanded the combined electrolyte battery system. As a corresponding author, he has published over 500 research papers and is a holder of over 80 authorized patents. Professor Zhou is a pioneer in the field of lithium–oxygen batteries, proposed a comprehensive mechanism for oxygen anion redox energy storage, and designed new high-energy-density lithium batteries. (5−9) Zhou and his team creatively introduced the "Li2O–Li2O2" oxygen anion redox process for charge storage, offering advantages such as high coulombic efficiency, good reversibility, and mild stability for the battery system. (6) He also discovered the critical role of trace amounts of H2O in enhancing the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) processes in organic electrolytes, proposing a synergistic catalytic mechanism between H2O molecules and Ru/SP/MnO2 cathodes, leading to breakthrough in lithium–air batteries. (7) Building upon the oxygen anion redox energy storage mechanism, he designed various highly efficient catalysts (e.g., Ir and Ni) to expand the reversible capacity of the cathode and suppress oxygen evolution. (6,8) Professor Zhou also proposed a concentrated dual-salt LiFSI–LiNO3/DOL electrolyte to improve the high-rate performance of lithium metal anodes, delivering stable operation for 240 cycles at 8.0 mA cm–2 and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.14%. (9) He also invented a closed lithium–oxygen battery with a lithium metal anode and high-capacity Li2O cathode, achieving a practical specific energy of 513 Wh kg–1 and a charge–discharge cycle life exceeding 200 cycles. (8) Professor Zhou summarized the essential criteria for redox mediators (RMs) to function as catalysts in lithium–air batteries and revealed the catalytic mechanism of these soluble catalysts during the charging process: (1) 2RM– + 2e– = 2RM+ and (2) 2RM+ + Li2O2 = 2Li+ + O2 + 2RM. (10) This theory led to his pioneering use of trichloroethyl chloroformate (TCCF) as a soluble catalyst for not only significantly reducing the overpotential of the OER but also greatly enhancing the reaction rate of the oxygen electrode. (11) The innovation improved the rate performance of lithium–oxygen batteries by over 10 times, with the cathode achieving a discharge specific capacity of 2005 mAh g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1.Professor Haoshen Zhou has also made groundbreaking contributions to the study of lithium–carbon dioxide (Li–CO2) batteries, high-energy-density batteries without lithium anodes, and development of new battery systems. He introduced in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to the study of CO2 electrode reactions, proposing the reaction mechanism for the reversible reduction and evolution of CO2 at the air electrode interface: 3CO2 + 4e– + 4Li+ = 2Li2CO3 + C. (12) He further introduced molten salt electrolytes, which verified the reversible reaction pathway of CO2 at the air electrode, reduced the electrode overpotential, and significantly improved the energy storage efficiency of the battery. (13) Professor Zhou and his team were the first to propose a lithium supplementation mechanism based on the OER of Li2O, successfully addressing the issue of capacity degradation caused by lithium loss during charge and discharge cycles. (14) A prototype anode-free lithium-ion battery with a layered transition metal oxide cathode was designed and operated, achieving a specific energy of 320 Wh kg–1 and a cycle life of 300 cycles. Professor Zhou also creatively introduced the concept of a combined electrolyte, constructed from "organic electrolytes", "lithium-ion solid electrolytes", and "aqueous electrolytes", integrating the characteristics of two or more electrolytes to design multiple energy conversion systems, leading to the invention of a high-capacity lithium–air battery and a technology for directly extracting elemental lithium from seawater. (15) The pioneering concept of combined electrolytes further led to the demonstration of an electrolytic cell system that has achieved both lithium extraction from seawater (or brine) and conversion of electrical energy into the chemical energy of lithium as a new energy storage solution. (16)Professor Zhou and his team further expanded the concept of combined electrolytes to integrate molecular sieves or framework compounds with organic electrolytes for successfully mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions on the anode surface, enhancing the stability of high-capacity lithium secondary batteries at high voltages (greater than 5.2 V versus Li/Li+) and elevated temperatures (100 °C). (17) This achievement is significant for expanding the application scenarios of electrolytes in high-output voltage systems and improving the energy density of various battery configurations. Professor Zhou then introduced the Cu3(BTC)2 metal–organic framework (MOF) as a selective electrolyte in lithium–sulfur battery systems for effectively preventing polysulfide ions from shuttling to the lithium metal side, significantly reducing capacity loss with an average capacity decay of only 0.019% over 1500 cycles. (18) He also invented a polypropylene ultrathin membrane modified with MOFs that greatly enhances the cycle life of lithium metal battery systems while increasing energy density, achieving a specific energy of 354 Wh kg–1 and 80% retention of its initial capacity after 200 cycles. (19)To celebrate the achievement of Professor Zhou as one of the 2024 PIERs, Energy & Fuels is also pleased to present this SI that includes a collection of 41 invited papers (22 reviews, 18 articles, and 1 communication), contributed by some invited leading as well as early to mid-career authors in the related energy field.

The sulfur content in dense molecular regions is highly depleted in comparison to diffuse clouds. The reason for this phenomenon is unclear, and it is therefore necessary to carry out observational studies of sulfur-bearing species toward dense regions, mainly in early evolution stages. In this context, the analysis of sulfur-bearing molecules in a large sample of dense starless molecular cores is of great importance to help us uncover the early sulfur chemistry in these regions. From the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data archive, we selected a project in Band 7 (275--373 GHz), which contains the emission of several sulfur-bearing species. The observations were performed toward a sample of 37 dense cores that are embedded in the most massive infrared-quiet molecular clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. The lines of 34SO, SO$_ $, NS, SO, SO$^ $, and H$_ $CS were analyzed, and the column densities of each molecular species were obtained. Based on the continuum emission and two CH$_ $OH lines, the 37 cores were characterized in density and temperature, and the corresponding H$_ $ column densities were derived. The abundances of these sulfur-bearing species were derived and studied. We find that the abundances of the analyzed sulfur-bearing species increase with increasing gas temperature. Based on the correlation between abundances and temperature, we suggest that the chemistry involved in the formation of each of the analyzed molecules may similarly depend on T$_ k $ in the range 20 to 100 K. Additionally, we find that the comparisons among abundances are highly correlated in general. Taking into account that this correlation decreases in more evolved sources, we suggest that the sulfur-bearing species we analyzed have a similar chemical origin. Our observational results show that the X(SO$_ $)/X(SO) ratio can be used as a chemical clock of molecular cores. Based on the line widths of the molecular lines, we point out that molecules with an oxygen content (34SO, SO$_ $, SO, and SO$^ $) may be associated with warmer and more turbulent gas than the other molecules. H$_ $CS and NS are associated with more quiescent gas, probably in the external envelopes of the cores, which trace similar physical and chemical conditions. We complement recent similar works done toward more evolved sources with a large sample of sources, but also provide quantitative information about abundances that might be useful in chemical models for explaining the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium.

Learn more about eLife Assessments Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods Data availability References Article and author information Metrics Abstract It is well established that several Homo sapiens populations experienced admixture with extinct human species during their evolutionary history. Sometimes, such a gene flow could have played a role in modulating their capability to cope with a variety of selective pressures, thus resulting in archaic adaptive introgression events. A paradigmatic example of this evolutionary mechanism is offered by the EPAS1 gene, whose most frequent haplotype in Himalayan highlanders was proved to reduce their susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness and to be introduced in the gene pool of their ancestors by admixture with Denisovans. In this study, we aimed at further expanding the investigation of the impact of archaic introgression on more complex adaptive responses to hypobaric hypoxia evolved by populations of Tibetan/Sherpa ancestry, which have been plausibly mediated by soft selective sweeps and/or polygenic adaptations rather than by hard selective sweeps. For this purpose, we used a combination of composite-likelihood and gene network-based methods to detect adaptive loci in introgressed chromosomal segments from Tibetan WGS data and to shortlist those presenting Denisovan-like derived alleles that participate to the same functional pathways and are absent in populations of African ancestry, which are supposed to do not have experienced Denisovan admixture. According to this approach, we identified multiple genes putatively involved in archaic introgression events and that, especially as regards TBC1D1, RASGRF2, PRKAG2, and KRAS, have plausibly contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and of certain cardiovascular traits in high-altitude Himalayan peoples. These findings provided unprecedented evidence about the complexity of the adaptive phenotype evolved by these human groups to cope with challenges imposed by hypobaric hypoxia, offering new insights into the tangled interplay of genetic determinants that mediates the physiological adjustments crucial for human adaptation to the high-altitude environment. Introduction The scientific community currently agrees that the Homo sapiens species experienced admixture with extinct Hominins since traces of such inbreeding events are still detectable in the genomes of modern humans (Gouy and Excoffier, 2020). In fact, people belonging to non-African populations show 1–2% of Neanderthal ancestry (Green et al., 2010; Prüfer et al., 2014), while Melanesians and East-Asians present 3% and 0.2% of Denisovan ancestry, respectively (Reich et al., 2010; Meyer et al., 2013; Prüfer et al., 2014; Racimo et al., 2017). Despite evidence supporting selection against introgressed alleles has been collected (Simonti et al., 2016; Racimo et al., 2017; McArthur et al., 2021), some of the genomic segments showing signatures ascribable to archaic introgression were also proved to have been targeted by natural selection in modern human populations, thus providing examples for the occurrence of adaptive introgression (AI) events (Racimo et al., 2017). So far, several studies have indeed identified introgressed archaic alleles at high frequency in human genes involved in metabolism or in the response to environmental conditions, such as temperature, sunlight, and altitude (Prüfer et al., 2014; Vernot and Akey, 2014; Sankararaman et al., 2014; Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Gittelman et al., 2016; Racimo et al., 2017; Enard and Petrov, 2018; Dannemann and Racimo, 2018). Moreover, some genes that play a role in immune responses to pathogens are found to be characterized by a similar pattern of variability (Laurent et al., 2011; Enard and Petrov, 2018) and certain Neanderthal alleles have been shown to be associated with down-regulation of gene expression in brain and testes (McCoy et al., 2017; Racimo et al., 2017; Dannemann and Racimo, 2018). These works collectively attest how genetic variants introduced in the human gene pool by admixture with archaic species can significantly impact our biology by possibly comporting modifications in the modulation of several functional pathways. In particular, the high frequency of some archaic alleles in protein-coding and/or regulatory genomic regions suggests a possible adaptive role for Neanderthal and/or Denisovan variants, pointing to a further evolutionary mechanism having potentially contributed to the processes of human biological adaptation to different environmental and cultural settings. By introducing new alleles in the gene pool of a given population, admixture in fact provides a very rapid opportunity for natural selection to act on it (Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Jeong et al., 2014; Racimo et al., 2015; Hamid et al., 2021) and this is supposed to have likely occurred during the evolutionary history of H. sapiens, particularly after the last Out of Africa migration in the late Pleistocene (Sugden, 2018; Vahdati et al., 2022). According to this view, gene flow from extinct Hominin species could have facilitated the adaptation of H. sapiens populations to peculiar Eurasian environments. For instance, a Denisovan origin of the adaptive EPAS1 haplotype, which confers reduced susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness to Tibetan and Sherpa highlanders (Beall, 2007; Bigham et al., 2010; Yi et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011) is well established (Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021). However, the hard selective sweep experienced in high-altitude Himalayan populations by the EPAS1 introgressed haplotype has been demonstrated to account only for an indirect aspect of their adaptive phenotype, which does not explain most of the physiological adjustments they evolved to cope with hypobaric hypoxia (Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2018). Therefore, how far gene flow between Denisovans and the ancestors of Tibetan/Sherpa peoples facilitated the evolution of other key adaptive traits of these populations remains to be elucidated. To fill this gap, and to overcome the main limitation of most approaches currently used to test for AI (i.e., inferring archaic introgression and the action of natural selection separately by means of different algorithms, which increases the risk of obtaining biased results due to confounding variables), we assembled a dataset of whole-genome sequences (WGSs) from 27 individuals of Tibetan ancestry living at high altitude (Cho et al., 2017; Jeong et al., 2018) and we analysed it using a composite-likelihood method specifically developed to detect AI events at once (Setter et al., 2020). Notably, this method was designed to recognize AI mediated by subtle selective events (as those involved in polygenic adaptation) and/or soft selective sweeps, which represent the evolutionary mechanisms that are supposed to have played a more relevant role than hard selective sweeps during the adaptive history of human groups characterized by particularly small effective population size, such as Tibetans and Sherpa (Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2018). Coupled with validation of the identified putative adaptive introgressed loci through (1) the assessment of the composition of gene networks made up of functionally related DNA segments presenting archaic derived alleles that are absent in human groups which are supposed to do not have experienced Denisovan admixture, such as African ones, (2) the confirmation that natural selection targeted these genomic regions in populations of Tibetan ancestry, and (3) the quantification of genetic distance between modern and archaic haplotypes, such an approach provided new evidence about the biological functions that have mediated high-altitude adaptation in Himalayan populations and that have been favourably shaped by admixture of their ancestors with Denisovans. Results Spatial distribution of genomic variation and ancestry components of Tibetan samples After quality control (QC) filtering of the available WGS data, we obtained a dataset made up of 27 individuals of Tibetan ancestry characterized for 6,921,628 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). To assess whether this dataset represents a reliable proxy for the genomic variation observable in high-altitude Himalayan populations, we merged it with genome-wide genotyping data for 1086 individuals of East-Asian ancestry belonging to both low- and high-altitude groups (Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2017; Landini et al., 2021). We thus obtained an extended dataset including 231,947 SNVs (Supplementary file 1a), which was used to perform population structure analyses. Results from ADMIXTURE and principal components analysis (PCA) were found to be concordant with those described in previous studies (Jeong et al., 2014; Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2017; Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2021). According to the ADMIXTURE model showing the best predictive accuracy (K = 7) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), the examined WGS exhibited a predominant genetic component that was appreciably represented also in other populations speaking Tibeto-Burman languages, such as Tu, Yizu, Naxi, Lahu, and Sherpa (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Such a component reached an average proportion of around 78% in individuals of Tibetan ancestry from Nepal included in the extended dataset, as well as of more than 80% in the subjects under investigation, who live in the Nepalese regions of Mustang and Ghorka (Figure 1A, B). This suggests that after their relatively recent migration in Nepalese high-altitude valleys, these communities might have experienced a higher degree of isolation and genetic drift with respect to populations that are still settled on the Tibetan Plateau, in which the same ancestry fraction did not exceed 64% (Figure 1A, B). Nevertheless, the overall ADMIXTURE profile of the considered WGS appeared to be quite comparable to those inferred according to genome-wide genotyping data for other Tibetan populations (Figure 1A, B, Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Similarly, PCA pointed to the expected divergence of Tibetan and Sherpa high-altitude groups from the cline of genomic variation of East-Asian lowland populations (Abdulla et al., 2009; Jeong et al., 2014; Gnecchi-Ruscone et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2022; Figure 1C). Remarkably, the WGS under investigation clustered within the bulk of genome-wide data generated for other groups from the Tibetan Plateau, thus supporting their representativeness as concerns the overall genetic background of high-altitude Himalayan populations.

Detecting putative AI signatures in Tibetan genomes To identify genomic regions showing signatures putatively ascribable to AI events, we scanned Tibetan WGS with the VolcanoFinder algorithm and we computed the composite likelihood ratio (LR) and −logα statistics for each polymorphic site (Setter et al., 2020). We then considered the most significant results by focusing on loci showing LR values falling in the positive tail (i.e., top 5%) of the obtained distribution (see Materials and methods, Supplementary file 1b). According to such an approach, we were first able to recapitulate the AI event previously described for the EPAS1 gene (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A; Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). In fact, this chromosomal interval was found to be characterized by a remarkable number of variants (N = 19) showing significant LR scores, as well as by high overall values of −logα (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), suggesting, respectively, the plausible archaic origin of many alleles at this gene and an appreciable action of natural selection on it. Five of these significant SNVs have been already described as Denisovan-like derived alleles at outstanding frequency (i.e., ranging between 0.96 and 1) in Tibetans but not in other modern human populations (Supplementary file 1c; Zhang et al., 2021). On the contrary, at the genomic region encompassing EGLN1 (which we have considered as a negative control for AI, see Materials and methods) we detected high −logα values coupled with a low number of SNVs (N = 3) showing significant LR scores, with only one being remarkably above the adopted significance threshold (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and Supplementary file 1d). Overall, these findings are concordant with evidence from literature that suggest adaptive evolution of both EPAS1 and EGLN1 loci in high-altitude Himalayan populations (Yang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2022), although only the former was proved to have been impacted by archaic introgression (Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). Moreover, we were able to confirm other introgression signatures previously inferred from WGS data for populations of Tibetan ancestry, such as those involving the PRKCE gene and the MIRLET7BHG long non-coding region, which are located in the overlapping upstream chromosomal intervals, respectively, of EPAS1 and PPARA (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B). In line with what reported for EPAS1, also PPARA has been already proposed to play a role in the modulation of high-altitude adaptation of Himalayan human groups (Simonson et al., 2010; Horscroft et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). Interestingly, AI signatures identified by VolcanoFinder in the MIRLET7BHG locus extended also in the PPARA gene, as well in its downstream region (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A), supporting the findings described by Hu et al., 2017. Finally, we observed patterns comparable to those at EPAS1 and PPARA for 10 additional genomic regions that were differentially pointed out by previous studies as Tibetan and/or Han Chinese DNA segments potentially carrying introgressed Denisovan alleles (Hu et al., 2017; Browning et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Figure 2A, B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, Supplementary file 1e). Figure 2 with 4 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Distribution of VolcanoFinder statistics suggestive of putative adaptive introgrossed loci across the TBC1D1 and PRKAG2 genomic regions. On the x-axis are reported genomic positions of each single-nucleotide variant (SNV), while on the y-axis are displayed the related statistics obtained. Pink background indicates the chromosomal interval occupied by the considered genes, while the grey background identifies those genes (i.e., PGM2 in the TBC1D1 downstream genomic region and the RHEB gene in the upstream PRKAG2 region) possibly involved in regulatory transcription mechanisms. The dashed red line identifies the threshold set to filter for significant likelihood ratio (LR) values (i.e., top 5% of LR values). For both these genomic regions, the distribution of LR and −logα are concordant with those observed at the EPAS1 positive control for adaptive introgression (AI). (A) A total of 50 significant LR values (red stars) and −logα (grey diamonds) values resulted collectively elevated in both the TBC1D1 gene and its downstream genomic regions. A remarkable concentration of significant LR values characterizing 19 SNVs was especially observable in the first portion of the gene. (B) The entire PRKAG2 genomic region was found to comprise 46 SNVs showing significant LR values, with the greatest peaks being located in the downstream region associated to such gene. Peaks detected for the LR statistic are accompanied by peaks of −logα values. Validating genomic regions affected by archaic introgression To validate signatures of archaic introgression at the candidate AI loci identified with VolcanoFinder, we relied on the approach described by Gouy and Excoffier, 2020. In detail, we used the Signet algorithm to identify networks of genes participating to the same functional pathway and presenting archaic-like (i.e., Denisovan) derived alleles observable in the putative admixed group (i.e., Tibetans) but not in an outgroup of African ancestry (i.e., Yoruba, YRI), by assuming that only Eurasian H. sapiens populations experienced Denisovan admixture (see Materials and methods). After having crosschecked results from the VolcanoFinder and Signet analyses, we identified six gene networks that turned out to be consistently significant across all the Signet runs performed and that included a total of 15 genes pointed by VolcanoFinder as candidate AI loci (Supplementary file 1f). Four of these loci composed the gene network overall ascribable to the Pathways in Cancer biological functions, which included also the EPAS1 positive control for AI (Figure 3A). Most of the other genes supported by both the analyses were instead observed in significant networks belonging to the Ras signalling and AMPK signalling pathways (Supplementary file 1f). Figure 3 Download asset Open asset Significant gene networks including Denisovan-like derived alleles according to the Signet analysis. (A) Schematic representation of the activation of the RAS/MAPK(ERK) axis after interaction of the bradykinin receptors with their ligands (e.g., ANG II) within the framework of the Pathways in Cancer network. Genes supported by both Signet (i.e., belonging to the significant network associated to Pathways in cancer) and VolcanoFinder (i.e., including at least a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) showing likelihood ratio (LR) value within top 5% of the obtained results) analyses as potentially introgressed loci, are highlighted in red and present solid outline. Grey circles with dotted-dashed contour instead indicate genes supported only by Signet, while loci marked with stars are those including genomic windows showing LASSI T statistic within top 5% of the related distribution. After the interaction between ANG II (active enzyme angiotensin II) and bradykinin receptors, activation of the Ras protein encoded by KRAS mediated by RAS-GTPases (e.g., RASGRF2) comports a series of phosphorylation reactions that eventually promotes angiogenesis (Kranenburg et al., 2004). In detail, phosphorylation of the MAPK1 protein and prevention of MAPK1-DAPK-1-dependent apoptosis leads to increased MAPK1 activity (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Stevens et al., 2007) that causes improved FOS mRNA expression (Monje et al., 2005). FOS together with other proteins (e.g., Jun) forms the AP-1 transcription factor, which bounds to the VEGF promoter region upregulating its expression in endothelial cells (Catar et al., 2013) and sustaining angiogenesis when the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signalling cascade is inhibited (Lorenzo et al., 2014). (B) Gene network built by setting co-expression as force function and by displaying the entire set of genes identified by the Signet algorithm as belonging to significant pathways including Denisovan-like derived alleles. Genes whose variation pattern was supported by both VolcanoFinder and Signet analyses (e.g., TBC1D1) as shaped by archaic introgression are displayed with a solid black outline. The EPAS1 positive control locus that has been previously proved to have mediated adaptive introgression in Tibetan populations was represented as light-blue octagonal. Genes included in pathways involved in angiogenesis (e.g., RASGRF2) and/or activated in hypoxic conditions (e.g., PRKAG2) are reported as dark red and light-blue circles, respectively, while the remining fraction of significant genes are represented as light-grey circles. The closeness or the distance between all nodes reflects the tendency to be co-expressed with each other and all the connections inferred are characterized by a confident score ≥0.7. Interestingly, gene networks belonging to the Pathways in Cancer and Ras signalling pathway appeared to be tightly related from a functional perspective because included oncogenes that promote the initiation and progression of tumour growth by stimulating cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Kranenburg et al., 2004). In particular, according to the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database KRAS and RASGRF2 genes from the Ras signalling network were found to contribute also to the Pathways in Cancer functions (Figure 3A), especially by interacting with the identified candidate introgressed loci PLCB1, RASGRP2, DAPK1, MAPK1, FOS, and VEGFA to modulate the VEGF signalling pathway, which is activated in hypoxic conditions and induces the transcription of genes that promote angiogenesis (Figure 3A; Maxwell and Ratcliffe, 2002; Kranenburg et al., 2004). Also, the AMPK signalling pathway is known to be activated in different cell types by stresses such as deprivation of oxygen and/or glucose, leading to the inhibition of energy-consuming biosynthetic pathways (e.g., protein and glycogen synthesis) and to the activation of ATP-producing catabolic pathways, such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Chen et al., 2018; Dengler, 2020). No significant gene networks involving the EGLN1 genomic region considered as a negative control for AI were instead reconstructed with the Signet approach (Supplementary file 1f), suggesting that the very few variants at this locus that showed VolcanoFinder LR scores above the adopted significant threshold might represent false positive results (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and Supplementary file 1d). Shortlisting introgressed genomic regions characterized by adaptive evolution To further shortlist the most robust candidate genes involved in AI events, we applied the LASSI algorithm to phased Tibetan WGS data with the aim of searching for genomic signatures ascribable to the action of natural selection (Harris and DeGiorgio, 2020) (see Materials and methods). This enabled us to confirm the strong selective events occurred at the EPAS1 and EGLN1 genes, as previously reported by multiple studies conducted on high-altitude Himalayan populations (Beall et al., 2010; Yi et al., 2010; Simonson et al., 2010; Horscroft et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021), as well as to corroborate adaptive evolution of some of the genes pointed out by both VolcanoFinder and Signet analyses. In fact, several chromosomal intervals associated to these loci presented values of the computed T statistic that fall within the top 5% of the related distribution (Figure 4C, D, Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2C, D, Figure 4—figure supplement 3C, D). Figure 4 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Representation of genetic distances between modern and archaic haplotypes and barplots showing haplotype frequency spectra for TBC1D1 and RASGRF2 candidate adaptive introgression (AI) genes. Haplotypes are reported in rows, while derived (i.e., black square) and ancestral (i.e., white square) alleles are displayed in columns. Haplotypes are ranked from top to bottom according to their number of pairwise differences with respect to the Denisovan sequence. (A) Heatmap displaying divergence between Tibetan, CHB and YRI TBC1D1 haplotypes with respect to the Denisovan genome. A total of 33 TBC1D1 haplotypes (i.e., 61% of the overall haplotypes inferred for such a region) belonging to individuals with Tibetan ancestry are plotted in the upper part of the heatmap thus presenting the smallest number of pairwise differences with respect to the Denisovan sequence. (B) Heatmap displaying divergence between Tibetan, CHB and YRI RASGRF2 haplotypes with respect to the Denisovan genome. A total of 16 Tibetan haplotypes in the RASGRF2 genomic region present no differences with respect to the Denisovan sequence. As regards barplots, on the x-axis are reported the haplotypes detected in the considered genomic windows, while on the y-axis is indicated the frequency for each haplotype. The black and dark-grey bars indicate the more frequent haplotypes (i.e., the putative adaptive haplotypes inferred by the LASSI method), while red stars mark those haplotypes carrying Denisovan-like derived alleles. (C) TBC1D1 haplotype frequency spectrum. The TBC1D1 gene presents a haplotype pattern qualitatively comparable to that observed at EPAS1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A), with a predominant haplotype carrying archaic derived alleles and reaching elevated frequencies in Tibetan populations. In line with this observation, such a pattern was inferred by LASSI as conformed with a non-neutral evolutionary scenario, even if it seems to be characterized by a soft rather than a hard selective sweep due to the occurrence of three sweeping haplotypes. (D) RASGRF2 haplotype frequency spectrum. A soft selective sweep was inferred also for the considered RASGRF2 genomic window, although frequencies reached by the sweeping haplotypes turned out to be more similar with each other. The second most represented haplotype was that carrying the archaic derived alleles and, reached a frequency of 29% in the Tibetan group. More in detail, in addition to EPAS1, genomic windows associated to the DAPK1, GNG7, AK5, TBC1D1, PLCB1, RASGRF2, and PRKAG2 introgressed loci supported by both VolcanoFinder and Signet approaches were found to present scores within the top 5% of the T distribution, suggesting that their haplotype diversity was appreciably shaped by positive selection. Interestingly, adaptive evolution of the TBC1D1 and RASGRF2 genes has been previously proposed by studies conducted on different populations of Tibetan ancestry (Peng et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2023). Estimating genetic distance between modern and archaic sequences As a final step for prioritizing the most convincing AI genes supported by VolcanoFinder, Signet, and LASSI approaches, as well as to explicitly test whether the Denisovan human species represented a plausible source of archaic alleles for them, we merged Tibetan WGS data with those from low-altitude Han Chinese (CHB) and YRI populations sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Auton et al., 2015), and with the Denisovan genome. We then used the Haplostrip algorithm (Marnetto and Huerta‐Sánchez, 2017) to estimate genetic distance between modern and archaic haplotypes at the candidate AI genes reported in the previous paragraph. We especially considered genomic windows that included Denisovan-like derived alleles and that presented values of the likelihood T statistic supporting an adaptive evolution (see Materials and methods). Among the tested putative AI loci, TBC1D1, RASGRF2, PRKAG2, and KRAS were found to present substantial proportions of Tibetan haplotypes that cluster close to the Denisovan sequence, thus showing the lowest numbers of pairwise differences with respect to it as compared with CHB or YRI haplotypes (Figure 4A, B, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B). More in detail, 61% of the TBC1D1 Tibetan haplotypes turned out to be the nearest ones to the archaic sequence by entailing only two pairwise differences with respect to it (Figure 4A), while 29% of Tibetan haplotypes inferred for the RASGRF2 gene were even identical to the Denisovan DNA (Figure 4B). Interestingly, both these chromosomal intervals were classified by the LASSI method as regions whose variation pattern was conformed with the soft selective sweep model, presenting three potential adaptive haplotypes (i.e., those haplotypes that plausibly carry putative advantageous alleles and thus increased in frequency due to positive selection). At each gene, one of these haplotypes was found to contain the Denisov
