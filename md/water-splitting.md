High-entropy materials (HEMs) play a significant role in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their unique properties. However, there are still challenges in the preparation of HEMs for OER catalysts. In this study, the FeCoNiMnCr catalyst is synthesized for the first time using the ultrasonic hydrothermal-sintering technique and exhibits excellent performance for OER electrocatalysis. There is an optimal ultrasonic hydrothermal time and power for achieving the best OER performance. The results demonstrate that the performance of FeCoNiMnCr catalysts prepared through ultrasonic hydrothermal sintering (US-FeCoNiMnCr) is significantly improved compared with the traditional hydrothermal-sintering method. The US-FeCoNiMnCr catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 228 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope as low as 45.39 mV dec−1 in an alkaline medium. Moreover, the US-FeCoNiMnCr catalyst demonstrates remarkable stability in electrocatalytic OER with a minimal potential increase observed even after 48 h. This work not only provides valuable insights into high-entropy material synthesis, but also presents a powerful electrocatalyst for water electrolysis.

The development of low‐cost transition metal compounds with high‐performance for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in promoting the development of electrocatalysis. In this study, a Ce‐doped Ni3S4 catalyst (Ce0.2‐Ni3S4) was synthesized through a one‐step solvothermal method, where the doped rare earth element Ce induced the transformation of NiS to Ni3S4. The Ce0.2‐Ni3S4 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance in 1 M KOH. At a current density of 10 mA cm‐2, it showed a low overpotential of 230 mV and a low Tafel slope of 52.39 mV dec‐1. Long‐term OER tests at the same potential lasted for 24 h without significant loss of current density. This work introduces a novel method of Ce element doping for modifying transition metal sulfides, providing new insights into the effective utilization of rare earth elements in the field of electrochemistry. It creates more chances for the progress of highly efficient catalysts for efficient OER, contributing to the advancement of electrocatalysis.

It is important for the practical application of water electrolysis to explore stable and earth-rich bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). An immersion-selenization strategy was proposed to prepare CoSe2/Co nanorods anchored on Co foam as bifunctional catalysts for OER and UOR. Due to the self-supported properties of CoSe2/Co and its unique nanorod structure, the OER activity is enhanced, showing an overpotential of 318 mV and a Tafel slope of 91.11 mV dec–1. In addition, the electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic UOR activity with an overpotential of 260 mV and a Tafel slope of 94.83 mV dec–1. The nanorod structure was basically retained after a 28 h durability test. This work provides a broad approach to the development of low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Electrochemical water splitting is regarded as an effective technology for producing green hydrogen, which is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. In particular, direct seawater splitting offers significant economic and environmental advantages. However, its efficiency is hindered by the high overpotential required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the competition from chloride oxidation. This review highlights the potential of interface engineering to overcome these limitations and develop efficient OER electrocatalysts. We comprehensively explore recent advancements in interface engineering for OER in both alkaline and seawater environments. We begin by introducing the mechanisms of freshwater and seawater electrolysis, emphasizing key considerations for OER catalyst design. Subsequently, we review the recent progress made in various interface engineering strategies, analyzing their impact on OER performance in both electrolytes. Finally, we outline promising future directions for developing efficient seawater oxidation catalysts through interface engineering.

In this research, a new nanocomposite was synthesized via the sol–gel method by encapsulation of tetranuclear sandwich-type hetropolyanion (Na9K[(FeW9O34)2Fe4(H2O)2].32H2O, abbreviated as Fe2W18Fe4, on the surface of MOF-Ni-100 for the first time. The as-prepared nanocomposite (Fe2W18Fe4@MOF-Ni-100) was examined using different microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, including FT-IR, UV–vis, XRD, SEM, EDX, and BET techniques. The assembled Fe2W18Fe4@MOF-Ni-100 nanocomposite served as a potential heterogeneous catalyst in the water oxidation process for the purpose of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at neutral pH conditions (N2-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4). The electrochemical characteristics of the Fe2W18Fe4@MOF-Ni-100 nanocomposite was assessed through cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The desired nanocatalyst displayed a low onset potential of 1.1 V vs. NHE and low overpotential of 269 mV at a current density (j) of 10 mAĊcm−2 with a Tafel slope of 73 mV.dec−1 (pH = 7). Furthermore, the Fe2W18Fe4@MOF-Ni-100 nanocomposite exhibited remarkable stability and retained its catalytic activity even after 200 catalytic cycles.

Abstract Silica‐derived nanostructured catalysts (SDNCs) are a class of materials synthesized using nanocasting and templating techniques, which involve the sacrificial removal of a silica template to generate highly porous nanostructured materials. The surface of these nanostructures is functionalized with a variety of electrocatalytically active metal and non‐metal atoms. SDNCs have attracted considerable attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, tunable electronic configuration, and microstructure. These properties make them highly efficient catalysts and promising electrode materials for next generation electrocatalysis, energy conversion, and energy storage technologies. The continued development of SDNCs is likely to lead to new and improved electrocatalysts and electrode materials. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the development of SDNCs for electrocatalysis and energy storage applications. It analyzes 337,061 research articles published in the Web of Science (WoS) database up to December 2022 using the keywords “silica”, “electrocatalysts”, “ORR”, “OER”, “HER”, “HOR”, “CO 2 RR”, “batteries”, and “supercapacitors”. The review discusses the application of SDNCs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), supercapacitors, lithium‐ion batteries, and thermal energy storage applications. It concludes by discussing the advantages and limitations of SDNCs for energy applications.

Abstract The rutile phase IrO 2 , as a promising catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still falls short of satisfactory activity. Here, a novel 1D monoclinic phase iridium‐ruthenium oxide solid solution (m‐Ir x Ru 1‐x O 2 ) is reported. For m‐Ir x Ru 1‐x O 2 with different metal proportions, the optimal m‐Ir 0.91 Ru 0.09 O 2‐δ catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity under acidic conditions with an overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA cm −2 . As an anode catalyst in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, m‐Ir 0.91 Ru 0.09 O 2‐δ with a low catalyst loading (0.1 mg cm −2 ) can operate ≈256 h at 1.8 V with a high current density over 900 mA cm −2 at room temperature. Such a satisfied stability may have originated from the specific morphology and crystal structure, which is confirmed by the transient potential scanning test. Density functional theory calculations show that the Ru in the m‐Ir x Ru 1‐x O 2 facilitates decreasing the OER overpotentials due to the electron transfer from Ru to Ir.

Abstract Understanding of fundamental mechanism and kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts owing to its key role in electrochemical energy conversion devices. In the past few years, the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) arising from the anodic redox chemistry has attracted significant attention as it involves a direct O─O coupling and thus bypasses thermodynamic limitations in the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Transition metal‐based oxyhydroxides are generally acknowledged as the real catalytic phase in alkaline media. In particular, their low‐dimensional layered structures offer sufficient structural flexibility to trigger the LOM.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an alternative route to the conventional anthraquinone process, but it is still restricted by the prevailing competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we reveal that intrinsic oxygen vacancies (OVs) of BiVO4 photoanodes are detrimental to PEC water oxidation to H2O2. The superabundant OVs of the BiVO4 photoanode are passivated by a thermal treatment in a pressurized O2 atmosphere by a Parr reactor. The passivated BiVO4 photoanode with the least OV concentration achieves ca. two times H2O2 selectivity enhancement than the BiVO4 photoanode with introduced OVs, resulting from the weakened band bending, the positively shifted quasi-Fermi level, and the suppressed decomposition of as-formed H2O2. In particular, the photoexcited electrochemical impedance spectra demonstrate a hole distribution rearrangement of the OVs-passivated BiVO4, which eliminates the OER-related surface states and steers the water oxidation reaction pathway toward H2O2 formation. This work reveals the importance of interfacial energetics induced by regulating intrinsic OVs in selective PEC water oxidation.

Abstract In this investigation, we successfully produced NiCo 2 O 4 nanostructures using a simple chemical precipitation method, wherein we adjusted molarity concentration of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) and precursor ratios of Ni and Co. Analysis of surface features revealed a diverse range of shapes, including particles, flowers, rods, and flakes. Notably, the NiCo 2 O 4 nanorods (NCO3) demonstrated a significant threefold increase in BET surface area compared to NCO5. The alterations observed in the physical and chemical characteristics significantly influenced the electrocatalytic efficacy in alkaline environments for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In the context of the oxygen reduction reaction, NCO5 displayed a commencement potential of 0.72 V compared to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing NCO4 by 110 mV, albeit falling short by 90 mV when compared to Pt/C, the standard benchmark material with a potential of 0.82 V. In terms of OER, NCO3 displayed a potential difference of 152 mV@10mA/cm 2 compared to other NiCo 2 O 4 materials and Pt/C. The increased level of activity observed can be attributed not only to the increased surface area but also to enhancements in electrical properties. This is supported by the lower charge transfer resistance measured in NCO3 (215.2 Ω.cm 2 ) compared to NCO5 (350.2 Ω.cm 2 ) as revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

The application of transition metal oxides in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for generating pollution-free energy has received extensive attention; however, many challenges still hinder its commercial application. Herein, a carbon fiber paper (CFP) with high conductivity (σ = 176.72 S m–1) was prepared in our lab and used as a free-standing substrate for OER and LIB electrodes. The FeCoO nanosheets with a mesoporous structure are homogeneously anchored on the CFP by a hydrothermal method and air calcination oxidation. The nanosheet structure of FeCoO effectively mitigates the volumetric expansion of the FeCoO/CFP composite while cycling, preventing the collapse of FeCoO and ensuring the fabrication integrity of the electrode. Moreover, the high conductivity of CFP accelerates electron transport and enhances reaction kinetics. For OER, the prepared FeCoO/CFP composites achieve an overpotential of 258 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 with a long-term durability of about 50 h. For LIBs, the FeCoO/CFP composites possess a high reversible capacity of 715.2 mA h g–1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g–1. It is confirmed that the self-made CFP is a good substrate for freestanding electrodes, and the FeCoO/CFP composites show potential applications in OER electrocatalysts and LIB anode materials.

In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the selection of highly active catalysts is fundamental to curtail overpotentials and to enhance the typically sluggish kinetics characteristic of the reaction. Cobalt selenide (Co3Se4), with its optimally configured electronic structure of cobalt ions, is consistently hailed as a prospective electrocatalyst for the OER, making it highly efficient in facilitating the reaction. Despite the persistent challenges of the exposure of catalytic active sites and the limited electronic conductivity, our study unveils a breakthrough solution. We introduce a highly efficient Fe-doped Co3Se4 electrocatalyst for the OER, addressing these long-standing issues, and it has desirable compositional flexibility, formed Co3-xFexSe4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) selenides, by introducing Fe doping, the electronic structure of Co3Se4 is effectively regulated, resulting in a remarkable reduction in the overpotential of the OER under alkaline conditions. Simultaneously, the introduction of Fe induces the formation of highly active Co–O sites, ultimately establishing a highly active and stable catalytic surface for oxygen evolution. Consequently, this leads to a significant improvement in the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesized Co2.5Fe0.5Se4 catalyst exhibits lower overpotential (η10 = 220 mV) and Tafel slope (41.2 mV dec−1), which is superior to the general commercial RuO2 benchmark. In addition, Co2.5Fe0.5Se4 also exhibits exceptional structural integrity and sustained operational longevity, with a durability of up to 280 h at 100 mA cmgeo−2. Impressively, the Pt/C∥Co2.5Fe0.5Se4 water electrolysis cell only requires a battery voltage of 1.67 V to provide a current density of 100 mA cmgeo−2 and has excellent long-term stability.

Abstract The discovery of Mn-Ca complex in photosystem II stimulates research of manganese-based catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, conventional chemical strategies face challenges in regulating the four electron-proton processes of OER. Herein, we investigate alpha-manganese dioxide (α-MnO 2 ) with typical Mn IV -O-Mn III -H x O motifs as a model for adjusting proton coupling. We reveal that pre-equilibrium proton-coupled redox transition provides an adjustable energy profile for OER, paving the way for in-situ enhancing proton coupling through a new "reagent"— external electric field. Based on the α-MnO 2 single-nanowire device, gate voltage induces a 6-fold increase in OER current density at 1.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the proof-of-principle external electric field-assisted flow cell for water splitting demonstrates a 34% increase in current density and a 44.7 mW/cm² increase in net output power. These findings indicate an in-depth understanding of the role of proton-incorporated redox transition and develop practical approach for high-efficiency electrocatalysis.

The study of non-precious metals to prepare catalytic materials with high performance and excellent stability is an important part of improving hydrogen production by electrolysis of water. In this work, we report on the preparation of direct composite Mo-CoFe LDH/NF as the working electrode of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using nickel foam as the substrate via one-step hydrothermal method. The direct growth in situ ensured the close contact between LDH and NF substrate, thereby reducing the charge transfer resistance and making the electrode have high electrocatalytic performance. At the current density of 10 mA·cm−2, the oxygen evolution overpotential of the Mo-CoFe LDH/NF catalytic material was 252 mV, the Tafel slope was 22.07 mV/dec, and the material could be maintained in alkaline solution for 10 hours, showing good stability. Therefore, this work proposed new ideas for the design and fabrication of low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst materials.

Exploring efficient, low-cost electrocatalysts is critical for improving the efficiency of water splitting reactions. Noble-metal-based oxides exhibit high activities in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their high cost and the lack of natural resources hinder their practical application. Therefore, in this study, we successfully synthesized an FeCoNiMgB high-entropy boride powder via a facile chemical reduction method for use as an OER catalyst in an alkaline medium. The FeCoNiMgB powder, with an ultrathin fluffy cotton structure, exhibited an excellent OER catalytic performance, affording an overpotential of 268 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a low Tafel slope of 42.9 mV/dec; this performance was superior to those of FeCoNiB, FeNiMgB, CoNiMgB, FeCoMgB, and commercial RuO2. The FeCoNiMgB powder also displayed remarkably stable catalytic properties for >72 h with no clear evidence of degradation. Finally, using theoretical calculations, the excellent OER performance of FeCoNiMgB was verified in terms of its adsorption and charge transfer energies and covalence. The performance and stability of FeCoNiMgB were equivalent or superior to those of several nanostructured catalysts, and thus, this study provided valuable insight into the design of efficient high-entropy boride materials.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a promising technology merging the usage of intermittent renewable energy sources with the production of green hydrogen. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction remains the bottleneck of the efficiency of these devices due to sluggish reaction kinetics, high cost, and the scarcity of state-of-the-art catalytic materials. Though most research is focused on the discovery of new catalytic materials, understanding the effects of acid electrolyte anions is crucial to designing and optimizing existing electrocatalysts in diverse electrochemical microenvironments. Herein, we systematically study the effects of acid electrolytes on the IrO2(110) surface under OER reaction conditions using density functional theory. The potential-dependent anion adsorption results show that HPO42– adsorbs the strongest, followed by SO42–, NO3–, and ClO4– respectively at 1.6 V (vs RHE). HPO42– and SO42– block the Ir-active sites by competitively adsorbing with the OER intermediates while ClO4– does not interfere with OER performance. By evaluating dipole-field interactions, surface work function changes, Bader charges of adsorbed anions, and the effects of adsorbed electrolyte anions on the adsorption of the OER intermediates, we provide further insights into acid anion electrolyte effects under the OER conditions. This expansion of fundamental understanding of the effects of acid electrolyte anion adsorption on IrO2 assists in engineering better-performing catalysts with integrated electrolyte microenvironment for OER.

The evolution of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a pivotal challenge in the realm of oxygen electrocatalysis. Recently, the proposition of regulating spin states has emerged as a novel avenue for enhancing the efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions. Presently, accurately modulating the metal active center into immediate spin (IS) remains a formidable challenge. Here, our research has achieved a breakthrough in precise spin state control and catalytic performance enhancement of Co3+ through the utilization of Ni-substituted LaCo1-xNixO3 perovskite. This achievement is primarily attributed to the fine regulation of both the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) and primary coordination sphere (PCS), i.e., Co6-y-[Co]-Niy (y = 0–6) and Co-O lengths, respectively. Our findings reveal that LaCo7/9Ni2/9O3 consisted of the SCS (y ≤ 2) with the eg1 fillings of IS Co3+ exhibits an optimal OER activity. Additionally, adjusting the Co-O bond length in PCS to approximately 1.89 Å proves to be more conducive to the transition of Co3+ spin states from high spin (HS) and low spin (LS) to IS. These discoveries present new approach to precisely modulating the spin state, offering promising prospects for the development of high-efficiency OER catalysts.

Due to the excellent activity and stability of MnCo2O4 toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic solution, a Pb–MnCo2O4 composite anode for zinc electrowinning was prepared by embedding dispersed MnCo2O4 particles into a Pb matrix in a powder metallurgy process. In this work, the phase structure, chemical composition, and morphology of the oxide layers formed on Pure-Pb and Pb–MnCo2O4 were analyzed by XRD, SEM, and EDS. Galvanostatic polorization, Tafel tests, and EIS measurements were performed to investigate the anodic potential variation and OER kinetics of the Pure-Pb and Pb–MnCo2O4 composite anodes. Compared with that on the Pure-Pb anode, the oxide layer on Pb–MnCo2O4 is thinner, more compact, and more stable in a 160 g L−1 H2SO4 solution containing 4 g L−1 Mn2+. Consequently, the Pb–MnCo2O4 composite anode exhibited a much lower anode slime production (8.7 mg) during 72 h of the simulated zinc electrowinning process. Despite the smaller surface area and lower PbO2 content of the oxide layer, the Pb–MnCo2O4 composite anode presented preferable OER kinetics with a lower OER charge transfer resistance (0.729 Ω cm2) and a smaller Tafel slope (90.74 mV dec−1), which contributed to a 70 mV reduction in the anodic potential compared with that of the Pure-Pb anode.

With the increasing need of clean energy demand, the development of efficient and green electrocatalysts for water electrolysis plays an irreplaceable role in the realization of large-scale production of hydrogen. Herein, an original iron modulated heterogeneous VN/V3O4/Co5·47N nanoparticles (FVOCN) is successfully synthesized using hydrothermal technique and in situ pyrolysis protocol. Through a series of characterization, it is found that the addition of iron in VN/V3O4/Co5·47N (VOCN) can significantly regulate the electronic structure and make it have better electrochemical oxygen evolution activity in 1 M KOH solution as opposed to the VOCN. The catalyst is obtained at the sintering temperature of 600 °C has the best performance, which only requires a lower overpotential of 270 mV to attain the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and superior to commercial IrO2. The method of introducing iron into vanadium-based, cobalt-based nitrides and vanadium-based oxides can broaden the research content of new electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts and provide a reference idea for the development of energy industry.
