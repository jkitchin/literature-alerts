The electrochemical splitting of seawater is promising but also challenging for sustainable hydrogen gas production. Herein, ZIF-67 nanosheets are grown on nickel foam and then etched by Ni2+ in situ to obtain a hierarchical hollow nanosheets structure, which demonstrates outstanding OER performance in alkaline seawater (355 mV at 100 mA cm−2). Diven by a silicon solar panel, an overall electrolysis energy efficiency of 62% is achieved at a high current of 100 mA cm−2 in seawater electrolytes. This work provides a new design route for improving the catalytic activity of metal organic framework materials.

The four-electron oxidation process of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) highly influences the performance of many green energy storage and conversion devices due to its sluggish kinetics. The fabrication of cost-effective OER electrocatalysts via a facile and green method is, hence, highly desirable. This review summarizes and discusses the recent progress in creating carbon-based materials for alkaline OER. The contents mainly focus on the design, fabrication, and application of carbon-based materials for alkaline OER, including metal-free carbon materials, carbon-based supported composites, and carbon-based material core–shell hybrids. The work presents references and suggestions for the rational design of highly efficient carbon-based OER materials.

Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e– oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy‐intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e– oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial‐level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50‒421 mA cm‒2 with 84‒100% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856‒7842 μmol cm‐2 h‐1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low‐current electrolysis. Finite‐element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e– oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.

The advancement of rechargeable zinc–air batteries (RZABs) faces challenges from the pronounced polarization and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Single-atom catalysts offer an effective solution, yet their insufficient or singular catalytic activity hinders their development. In this work, a dual single-atom catalyst, FeCo-SAs, was fabricated, featuring atomically dispersed N3–Fe–Co–N4 sites on N-doped graphene nanosheets for bifunctional activity. Introducing Co into Fe single-atoms and secondary pyrolysis altered Fe coordination with N, creating an asymmetric environment that promoted charge transfer and increased the density of states near the Fermi level. This catalyst achieved a narrow potential gap of 0.616 V, with a half-wave potential of 0.884 V for ORR (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a low OER overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm–2. Owing to the superior activity of FeCo-SAs, RZABs exhibited a peak power density of 203.36 mW cm–2 and an extended cycle life of over 550 h, exceeding the commercial Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, flexible RZABs with FeCo-SAs demonstrated the promising future of bimetallic pairs in wearable energy storage devices.

A new dinuclear Ni(II) complex 1, [Ni2II(dtbh-PLY)2], is synthesized from 9-(2-(3,6-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazineyl)-1H-phenalen-1-one, dtbh-PLYH2 ligand, and structurally characterized by various analytical tools including the single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) technique. In the solid state, both Ni(II) metal centers in complex 1 exist in a distorted square planar geometry and display the presence of rare Ni···H–C anagostic interactions to form a one-dimensional (1-D) linear motif in the supramolecular array. Complex 1 is further stabilized in the solid state by π–π-stacking interactions between the highly delocalized phenalenyl rings. The redox features of complex 1 have been analyzed by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique in solution as well as in the solid state, revealing the crucial involvement of both the Ni(II) metal centers for undergoing quasi-reversible oxidation reactions on the application of an anodic sweep. A complex 1-modified glassy carbon electrode, GC-1, is employed as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH, giving an OER onset at 1.45 V, and very low OER overpotential, 300 mV vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to reach 10 mA cm–2 current density. Furthermore, GC-1 displayed fast OER kinetics with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec–1, a significantly lower Tafel slope value than those of previously reported molecular Ni(II) catalysts. In situ electrochemical experiments and postoperational UV–vis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed to analyze the stability of the molecular nature of complex 1 and to gain reasonable insights into the true OER catalyst.

Efficient and cost-effective catalysts are essential to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in sustainable hydrogen production through water splitting. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy aimed at constructing heterogeneous structure that form abundant Fe2O3/NiSe2 interfaces on the FeOOH surface. The resulting catalyst exhibits extraordinary performance with an excellently low overpotential of 169 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Notably, this catalyst also demonstrates impressive long-term stability in alkaline seawater. Compared to traditional heterogeneous catalysts with core-shell structures, Fe2O3/NiSe2 possesses a closely heterogeneous interface, which plays a role in modulating the interface electron. Supported by complementary spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, it has been further demonstrated that the distinctive Fe-O-Ni-Se structure can effectively modulate the electronic state of Ni, thereby enhancing the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates and facilitating oxygen desorption. Overall, this research presents a promising avenue for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance by amplifying active sites at interfaces.

Recently, perovskite oxides have acquired a rapidly growing research interest in energy storage and conversion systems, especially the electrolysis of water. Rational doping is an extremely effective strategy to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) of the perovskite oxides. Herein, a series of novel bi-functional electrocatalysts were synthesized by doping Ru in SrFeO3-δ perovskite oxide (SrFe1-xRuxO3-δ, x = 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45) which exhibit remarkable enhancements of HER/OER activities and long-term stabilities in the alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH). Among them, SrFe0.7Ru0.3O3-δ (SFR30) shows the best electrocatalytic activities for overall water splitting, exhibiting low overpotentials for HER (∼41 mV) and OER (∼334 mV) at −10 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively, generating current densities of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolytic cell using the potential of 1.58 V. In addition, the SFR30 electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable stability which can be operated continuously for 96 h without significant delay. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Ru doping can effectively modulate the adsorption of intermediates on the active sites to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance. Many new prospects have been opened for the development of bi-functional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

The oxygen -evolving complex (OEC) oxidises water to molecular dioxygen in photosystem II (PS II) at the redox catalytic centre on the lumenal side of PS II, which includes four manganese ions, a calcium ion and a chloride ion. Exact structure or mechanistic pathways charge transfer inside of OEC is still subject to research. Many inorganic complexes have been synthesised which show structural or functional resemblance with OEC. Theses complexes helps us in understanding election transfer mechanisms operating in different steps of the oxygen -evolving complex.

The anode of a proton exchange membrane (PEM)−based electrolyzer presently necessitates the utilization of iridium oxide (IrO2) as an anodic catalyst, which is exceedingly costly and scarce on Earth. Ruthenium oxide (RuO2) has garnered significant attention due to its superior catalytic activity and lower cost compared to IrO2. However, the relatively inadequate stability of RuO2 impedes its practical application. The deterioration of RuO2 is presently ascribed to the dissolution of Ru sites. Through systematic investigations encompassing distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis, leaching measurements, structural characterizations, and designed experiments, we verify that the deactivation of RuO2 is primarily attributed to the surface reconstruction of the catalyst to insert phase, rather than dissolution.

Abstract Water electrolysis remains a key component in the societal transition to green energy. Membrane electrolyzers are the state‐of‐the‐art technology for water electrolysis, relying on 80 °C operation in highly alkaline electrolytes, which is undesirable for many of the myriad end‐use cases for electrolytic water splitting. Herein, an alternative water electrolysis process, decoupled electrolysis, is described which performed in mild acidic conditions with excellent efficiencies. Decoupled electrolysis sequentially performs the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), at the same catalyst. Here, H + ions generated from the OER are stored through pseudocapacitive (redox) charge storage, and released to drive the HER. Here, decoupled electrolysis is demonstrated using cheap, abundant, TiO 2 for the first time. To achieve decoupled acid electrolysis, ultra‐small anatase TiO 2 particles (4.5 nm diameter) are prepared. These ultra‐small TiO 2 particles supported on a carbon felt electrode show a highly electrochemical surface area with a capacitance of 375 F g −1 . When these electrodes are tested for decoupled water splitting an overall energy efficiency of 52.4% is observed, with excellent stability over 3000 cycles of testing. This technology can provide a viable alternative to membrane electrolyzers—eliminating the need for highly alkaline electrolytes and elevated temperatures.

Abstract With the rapid development and maturity of electrochemical CO 2 conversion involving cathodic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), conventional ex situ characterizations gradually fall behind in detecting real‐time products distribution, tracking intermediates, and monitoring structural evolution, etc. Nevertheless, advanced in situ techniques, with intriguing merits like good reproducibility, facile operability, high sensitivity, and short response time, can realize in situ detection and recording of dynamic data, and observe materials structural evolution in real time. As an emerging visual technique, scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) presents local electrochemical signals on various materials surface through capturing micro‐current caused by reactants oxidation and reduction. Importantly, SECM holds particular potentials in visualizing reactive intermediates at active sites and obtaining instantaneous morphology evolution images to reveal the intrinsic reactivity of active sites. Therefore, this review focuses on SECM fundamentals and its specific applications toward CO 2 RR and OER, mainly including electrochemical behavior observation on local regions of various materials, target products and onset potentials identification in real‐time, reaction pathways clarification, reaction kinetics exploration under steady‐state conditions, electroactive materials screening and multi‐techniques coupling for a joint utilization. This review undoubtedly provides a leading guidance to extend various SECM applications to other energy‐related fields.

Abstract Hierarchical hollow urchin-like nickel cobaltite (NiCo 2 O 4 ) was synthesized using a two-step hydrothermal method. The effects of metal composition and surfactant addition on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated. The addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) reduced particle aggregation, resulting in a higher electrochemical active surface area and electrical conductivity. Lowering the Ni content from 1.0 to 0.25 did not alter the morphology and structure of the product to any extent. However, the crystallite size slightly increased. Among the spinels with different Ni and Co compositions, NiCo 2 O 4 exhibited a superior OER electrocatalytic activity, achieving a 380 mV overpotential at 10 mA/cm 2 current density. It also delivered a good performance in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) using 1 M NaOH at 60 °C, reaching a current density of about 420 mA/cm 2 at a cell voltage of 1.95 V.

Abstract Atom‐site catalysts, especially for graphitic carbon nitride‐based catalysts, represents one of the most promising candidates in catalysis membrane for water decontamination. However, unravelling the intricate relationships between synthesis‐structure‐properties remains a great challenge. This study addressed the impacts of coordination environment and structure units of metal central sites based on Mantel test, correlation analysis and evolution of metal central sites. An optimized unconventional oxygen doping cooperated with Co‐N‐Fe dual‐sites (OCN Co/Fe) exhibited synergistic mechanism for efficient peroxymonosulfate activation, which benefited from a significant increase in charge density at the active sites and the regulation in the natural population of orbitals, leading to selective generation of SO 4 •− . Building upon these findings, the OCN‐Co/Fe/PVDF composite membrane demonstrated a 33 min −1 ciprofloxacin (CIP) rejection efficiency and maintained over 96% CIP removal efficiency (over 24 h) with an average permeance of 130.95 L m −2 h −1 . Our work offers a fundamental guide for elucidating the definitive origin of catalytic performance in advance oxidation process (AOPs) to facilitate the rational design of separation catalysis membrane with improved performance and enhanced stability.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as promising electrocatalysts have been widely studied, but their performance is limited by conductivity and coordinating saturation. This study proposes a cationic (V) modification strategy and evaluates its effect on the electrocatalytic performance of CoFe–MOF nanosheet arrays. The optimal V–CoFe–MOF/NF electrocatalyst exhibits excellent oxygen-evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) performance (231 mV at 100 mA cm–2/86 mV at 10 mA cm–2) in alkaline conditions, with its OER durability exceeding 400 h without evident degradation. Furthermore, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting, a small cell voltage is achieved (1.60 V at 10 mA cm–2). The practicability of the catalyst is further evaluated by membrane electrode assembly (MEA), showing outstanding activity (1.53 V at 10 mA cm–2) and long-term stability (at 300 mA cm–2). Moreover, our results reveal the apparent reconstruction properties of V–CoFe–MOF/NF in alkaline electrolytes, where the partially dissolved V promotes the formation of more active β-MOOH. The mechanism study shows the OER mechanism shifts to a lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) after V doping, which directly avoids complex multistep adsorption mechanism and reduces reaction energy. This study provides a cation mediated strategy for designing efficient electrocatalysts.

Herein we propose a Ba-site Gd doping protocol in layered perovskites, demonstrating highly active bifunctional PrBa1-xGdxCo2O5+δ electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from enhanced oxygen surface exchange and chemical diffusion kinetics, resultant PrBa0.95Gd0.05Co2O5+δ (PBG0.05CO) exhibits an area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.038 Ω cm2 at 700 oC, reduced by ∼46.5% relative to undoped PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBCO). When evaluated as the air electrode, the as-fabricated single coin fuel cell delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 1230 mW cm-2 at 700 oC. For the CO2-electrolysis at 750 oC, the large current density (J) of 2630 mA cm-2 is achieved in the PBG0.05CO anode-based electrolysis cell at a voltage (V) of 1.8 V. Furthermore, exceptional operating stability is realized in both ORR and OER manners. Our findings highlight an effective strategy to optimize the electrocatalytic properties of layered perovskites, endowing potential applications in energy storage and conversion aspects.

Deep insight into the synergy between anion and cation aids in the maximization of catalytic activity and the rational exploitation of efficient oxygen-evolving catalysts. However, how to use ion exchange reconstruction to devise highly active and cost-efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with anion and cation synergies for water electrolysis is rarely reported. Herein, the cobalt triphosphide (CoP3) nanowires are elaborately devised as a component-flexible precatalyst for directing an anodic reconfiguration with Ni cation exchange to construct a highly active and quasi‐amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) catalyst integrated with cation (Ni) substitution and oxyanion (PO43-) decoration (denoted by R-(Ni)CoP3). Interestingly, the structural evolution and the Ni cation exchange processes are captured through various in/ex situ techniques. The resultant R-(Ni)CoP3 nanowires display a splendid activity with low overpotentials of 406 and 420 mV to respectively deliver industrial grade current densities of 1000 and 1500 mA cm−2, and an outstanding stability over 300 h at a large current density of 500 mA cm−2, superior to most progressive cobalt-based OER materials and the benchmark IrO2. The combination of theoretical calculations with experimental studies demonstrate that the synergy of cation (Ni) substitution and oxyanion (PO43-) decoration can significantly modulate the electronic states of CoOOH and optimize the adsorption free energy of OER intermediates, thus immensely expediting the kinetics process and enhancing the charge transfer ability and the intrinsic OER activity. This research suggests ion-regulatory reconfiguration as a flexible and changeable strategy to construct various efficient and advanced catalysts for water electrolysis and beyond.

We constructed a photoanode comprising the homogeneous water oxidation catalyst (WOC) Na8K8[Co9(H2O)6(OH)3(HPO4)2(PW9O34)3] (Co9POM) and nanoporous n-type TiO2 photoelectrodes (henceforth "TiO2–Co9POM") by first anchoring the cationic 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) ligand on a metal oxide light absorber, followed by treatment of the metal oxide-APS with a solution of the polyoxometalate WOC. The resulting TiO2–Co9POM photoelectrode exhibits a 3-fold oxygen evolution photocurrent enhancement compared to bare TiO2 in aqueous acidic conditions. Three-element (Co 2p, W 4f, and O 1s) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy studies before and after use indicate that surface-bound Co9POM retains its structural integrity throughout all photoelectrochemical water oxidation studies reported here. Extensive charge-transfer mechanistic studies by photoelectrochemical techniques and transient absorption spectroscopy elucidate that Co9POM serves as an efficient WOC, extracting photogenerated holes from TiO2 on the picosecond time scale. This is the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation elucidating the roles of polyoxometalates in POM-photoelectrode hybrid oxygen evolution reaction systems.

Seawater electrolysis holds great promise for sustainable green hydrogen generation, but its implementation is hindered by high energy consumption and electrode degradation. Two dimensional (2D) layered double hydroxide (LDH) exhibits remarkable stability, high catalytic activity, and excellent corrosion resistance in the harsh electrolytic environment. The synergistic effect between LDH and seawater ions enhances the oxygen evolution reaction, enabling efficient and sustainable green hydrogen generation. Here, we report a synthesis of low cost, novel 2D Vanadium Copper (VCu) LDH first time in the series of LDH’s as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. The electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) study of VCu LDH and VCu LDH/Graphite Carbon Nitride (g‐C3N4) nanohybrid was performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 (acidic), 1 M KOH (basic), 0.5 M NaCl (artificial seawater), 0.5 M NaCl + 1 M KOH (artificial alkaline seawater), real seawater and 1 M KOH + real seawater (alkaline real seawater) electrolyte medium. It was found that VCu LDH shows a remarkable lower overpotential of 72 mV hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 254 mV oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at current density of 10 mA/cm2 under alkaline real seawater electrolysis exhibiting bifunctional activity and also showing better stability.

Transition metal oxides are considered alternative electrocatalysts for ZAB owing to their multiple oxidation states. However, they have limitations such as low electrical conductivity and the deficiency of reactive sites. In this study, to overcome these shortcomings and improve electrocatalytic activity, oxygen vacancies and porous architectures were introduced through a partial reduction process and a porous carbon framework. Open porous carbon microspheres with uniformly loaded NiCo2O4 nanosheets and oxygen vacancies (V-NCO/OPC) displayed enhanced electrocatalytic performance with a low Tafel slope (68 mV dec-1) in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential (402 mV) at 10 mA cm–2 in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The combined effect of the oxygen vacancies and porous architecture can offer sufficient active sites, modify the electronic structure of the metal oxide surface, and facilitate mass transport, enhancing the electrocatalytic properties of V-NCO/OPC. Furthermore, when applied for ZAB, V-NCO/OPC demonstrated better electrochemical performance including discharge power density (154.9 mW cm-2) at the current density of 175.9 mA cm-2, low voltage gap (0.85 V) at the initial cycle, and long-term (250 h) cycle stability at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 than those of noble-metal electrocatalysts.

The development of non‐precious metal electrocatalysts with excellent activity and durability for electrochemical water splitting has always been a goal. Transition metal sulfides are attractive electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this article, we designed and constructed efficient catalysts with multiple synergistic interactions and synthesized Ce‐NiS2@NF nanosphere using a solvothermal method. Ce‐NiS2@NF exhibits excellent HER performance, OER performance, and overall water splitting capability in alkaline electrolytes, demonstrating good stability. The addition of Ce influences the activity of the catalysts, attributed to the synergistic interactions creating more active sites and higher intrinsic activity through the introduction of Ce heteroatoms. Additionally, the self‐supported conductive substrate promotes electron transfer, enhancing the intrinsic activity and active site density of the catalyst. This study provides an in‐depth investigation into structural design and performance enhancement, offering ideas for designing efficient catalysts for overall water electrolysis. This work provides an in‐depth study in terms of structural design performance enhancement and provides ideas for designing efficient alkaline bifunctional catalysts. Valuable insights have been provided in elucidating the intrinsic mechanism of the catalytic activity of cerium‐doped nickel sulfide nanospheres, thus providing new guidance in the field of energy conversion technology.

Abstract Engineering the intermetallic nanostructures as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is of great interest in green hydrogen production. However, a few non‐noble metals act as bifunctional electrocatalysts, exhibiting terrific HER and OER processes reported to date. Herein the intermetallic nickel–antimonide (Ni─Sb) dendritic nanostructure via cost‐effective electro‐co‐deposition method is designed and their bifunctional electrocatalytic property toward HER and OER is unrevealed. The designed Ni─Sb delivers a superior bifunctional activity in 1 m KOH electrolyte, with a shallow overpotential of ≈119 mV at ‐10 mA for HER and ≈200 mV at 50 mA for OER. The mechanism behind the excellent bifunctional property of Ni─Sb is discussed via “interfacial descriptor” with the aid of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). This study reveals the rate of electrocatalytic reaction depends on the energy required for electron and proton transfer from the catalyst's surface. It is noteworthy that the assembled Ni─Sb‐90 electrolyzer requires only a minuscule cell voltage of ≈1.46 V for water splitting, which is far superior to the art of commercial catalysts.

Water electrolysis is one promising and eco‐friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In response, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2‐xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best‐performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500% current density promotion at overpotential η = 300 mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe‐based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni:Fe ratio rather than Fe content in all metal elements. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2‐xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large‐scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.

Abstract In addressing the challenge of hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment (TME), a significant obstacle to effective cancer therapy, this research introduces a pioneering nanozyme engineered to utilize water and oxygen as reactants. Utilizing ultrasonic piezoelectricity, this nanozyme converts these substrates into oxygen (O 2 ) and reactive oxygen species, thereby amplifying oxidative stress without relying on endogenous H 2 O 2 . This approach involves the strategic engineering of porous ZnSnO v :Mn nanosheets (named MZSO NSs), which are distinguished by oxygen‐rich vacancies and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This breakthrough represents the initial attempt to merge catalytic activities akin to catalase (CAT) with the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), confirmed through both enzymatic reactions and electrochemical voltammetric analysis. The predominant mechanism of ultrasound‐augmented oxygen generation in MZSO is identified as piezoelectric hole‐induced OER. Supporting theoretical analyses clarify the synergistic impact of oxygen vacancies and Mn doping on the dynamics of carriers and the OER process, leading to a notable increase in catalytic efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of piezoelectric‐enhanced OER electrocatalysts to alleviate hypoxia in the TME, providing novel insights into the development of piezoelectric acoustic sensitizers for the treatment of cancer.

Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) catalysts with high catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity have been extensively studied, especially Fe and Co-based sulfides. Fe and Co active sites with a strong synergistic effect, which can adjust the electron density distribution and effectively improve the electrocatalytic OER activity. However, TMSs has poor stability in alkaline environment caused by metal ions and sulfur elements are facilitated to dissolve. In this work, TMSs was modified by polyaniline (PANI) to inhibit the precipitation of iron, cobalt, and sulfur elements and enhance its stability under alkaline conditions. Moreover, π-d structure can also be formed by the coating of polyaniline, which can further adjust its own electronic structure on the basis of stabilizing the TMSs structure, so as to improve the electrochemical performance, rendering them to stably operate at harsh environment for more than 90 h. These findings offer new guidance for improving the electrocatalytic stability of TMSs.

Improving the conductivity of the electrocatalyst itself is essential for enhancing its performance . In this work, N, S-rich 6-thioguanine (TG) is selected as the ligand to synthesize a Fe, Ni bimetallic porous coordination polymer (PCP), which is then derived to fabricate N,S codoped carbon (NSC)-coated (Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni3S2 bridged nanowires. The (Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni3S2@NSC bridged nanowires obtained through bimetallic synergistic catalysis and self-sulfurization processes not only introduced additional electrocatalytic active sites but also significantly enhance the overall conductivity of the catalyst due to the interconnected nanowire structure. The resulting (Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni3S2@NSC demonstrates remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, exhibiting an overpotential as low as 252 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This work proposes a novel strategy for enhancing the overall conductivity of catalysts by growing bridged nanowires, providing valuable insights and inspiration for the design and preparation of advanced transition metal sulfide electrocatalysts.

Several CoS2/Ni flow-through porous electrodes are fabricated to promote gas bubble release for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. Structural characterization shows that CoS2 catalyst is immobilized on the porous Ni substrate. The bubble average diameter can be decreased from 29.29 ± 17.9 μm to 13.51 ± 5.05 μm, and the desorption time is decreased from 1.615 s to 0.067 s, with the electrolyte velocity increase from 0 cm/s to 2.89 cm/sat the current density of 100 mA/cm2. A mathematical model is proposed to describe gas bubble grown, which is found that higher current density is not bring much bigger gas bubble. The overpotential of the CoS2/Ni electrode for OER is 498 mV at 100 mA/cm2. The overpotential of CoS2/Ni electrode can be decreased from 754 mV to 661 mV with the electrolyte velocity increase from 0 cm/s to 9.42 cm/s at 200 mA/cm2 with the energy required for hydrogen production reduced by 5.01 kWh/kmol.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a half-reaction that transpires at the anode during water electrolysis. It is a controlling step in the process because of slow kinetics. Therefore, developing OER catalysts with low cost, enduring stability, and wide-pH-value adaptability is a significant challenge. In this article, NiXCo2.4-X-MOF (x = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) catalysts were synthesized via hydrothermal on nickel foam (NF). The proportion and hydrothermal temperature can affect the performances, and the optimal catalyst is obtained with x= 0.6 and hydrothermal temperature is 150°C (Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF). This catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performances. The overpotentials are 1.77, 1.61, and 1.68 V in 1 M PBS (pH= 7), 1 M KOH, and alkaline seawater at 20, 200, and 200 mA cm-2 with excellent stability towards OER, respectively. In-situ SERS results suggest that during the OER process, hydroxyoxides are formed on the catalyst surface, which serves as the actual active substance. Furthermore, XPS analysis of the OER reaction reveals the formation of M-O and high-valence state oxides. DFT calculations confirm that Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF/NiCoOOH acts as the genuine active site for the OER, formed through the reconstruction of Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF, lowering the energy barrier for OOH* formation further accelerates the reaction kinetics of the OER. This study indicates the broad application prospects of MOFs in wide-pH-value and seawater.

Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have been utilized as cost-effective alternatives for noble metal electrocatalysts, exhibiting comparable activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nickel-cobalt selenide (NiCoSe) is a TMC exhibiting significant potential in reducing the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A carbon-based hydrochar support is used as a scaffold for depositing NiCoSe, ensuring the dispersion and stability of the synthesized electrocatalyst. This work develops a NiCoSe/hydrochar electrocatalyst to enhance the stability and activity of the TMC towards OER. Various compositions of nickel-cobalt selenide (NiCoSe 2 , Ni 0.85 Co 0.85 Se, and Ni 0.6 Co 0.4 Se 2 ) with a chitin-based hydrochar support are synthesized. The electrocatalytic activity is determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry using a three-electrode set-up. NiCoSe 2 has the lowest overpotential at 179.3 mV and a Tafel slope of 163.4 mV-dec -1 . This highlights the enhanced performance of NiCoSe 2 compared to other compositions.

Oxygen vacancies are important factors to tune the performance of oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it remains challenging how to control the concentration of the oxygen vacancies and decouple their effects on OER from other factors. In this work, we use a specific composition/phase La 0.4 Sr 0.6 FeO 3- d perovskite oxide as an example to tailor the oxygen vacancies of their nanoparticulate using a modified molten salt synthesis and ozone treatment. The OER performance of the resulting La 0.4 Sr 0.6 FeO 3- d nanoparticles with different degree of oxygen vacancies ranging from 0 to 25% are compared. The OER reactivity increases with increased oxygen vacancies in the materials, but the change is nonlinear. The OER stability, on the other hand, has a bimodal distribution. The activities of fully oxidized sample and the most oxygen-deficient sample degrade slower than the two samples in the middle. The results suggest that it is feasible to design catalysts with oxygen vacancy to be the most OER active and stable. Further investigation into the oxygen vacancy – active site relation would offer guiding principle to design and synthesize high OER performance oxide catalysts.

The activity of iron oxyhydroxides (FeOOH) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is limited by its poor conductivity and the high energy barrier in the rate-determining step. Herein, we report the immobilization of atomic dispersed Pd species on Co doped FeOOH, realizing the preparation of amorphous hetero-structure FeCoaOOH-Pdb. In the case of Co/Fe of 0.68 and Pd/Fe of 0.026, the coexisting structure of nanorods and nanospheres with appropriate oxygen vacancies and unsaturated active centers increases the number of active sites and enhances the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst. The density functional theory results uncover that the FeCo0.68OOH-Pd0.026 optimizes the binding energies of ⁎O and ⁎OOH, and accelerates the OER kinetics. The rationally designed FeCo0.68OOH-Pd0.026 exhibits excellent OER activity and reliability, manifesting a Tafel slope of 37.5 mV dec-1, a low overpotential of 265.1 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which has the potential to realize the large-scale implementation of water splitting.

Transition metal materials that loaded with trace of Iridium (Ir) are widely accepted as effective catalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which the Ir atoms exposed on the surface can directly affect the electrocatalytic reaction. However, this neglects the Ir – Ir interaction of distinct locations, which may be benefit for the fine-tuning of electronic structure. Herein, we changed the locations (surface and inside) of Ir atoms in the cobalt oxide (Co3O4@NC), and investigated their alkaline OER and HER performances. Combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical calculations, we infer that the steric interactions induced by the surface – internal Ir sites can weaken the Ir-O bond and optimize the adsorption of intermediates on catalyst surface with a negative shift of d-band center, enabling the surface-Ir sites with lower energy barrier for water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption for HER. Therefore, the as-prepared Irw-Co3O4@NC with surface − inside Ir distributions significantly improve the HER without degrading OER performance, with low overpotential of −173 / −71 mV for HER at −10 mA·cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH / 1.0 M KOH, and 244 / 249 mV at 10 mA·cm−2 for OER.

Actual work devoted to the development of a homological approach for describing the kinetic properties of grossly nonstoichiometric oxides ABO3-δ with perovskite structure. The approach consists in considering such oxides having different oxygen stoichiometry 3-δ as chemical homologues involved in the same oxygen exchange reaction and forming a continuous series in δ. The proposed approach is considered using the oxide with exceptional oxygen mobility Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF). The kinetic properties of BSCF were studied by new method of the oxygen partial pressure relaxation. The equilibrium properties of BSCF were reported earlier and obtained by original technique of the quasi-equilibrium oxygen release. The power law dependence of the kinetic parameters on the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure is considered as the consequence of linear free energy relationship similar to the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation.

Electrodeposition of abundant metals to fabricate efficient and durable electrodes play a viable role in advancing renewable electrochemical energy technologies. Herein, we deposit Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF onto nickel foam (NF) to form Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF as a highly efficient electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical investigation verifies that the Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER because of its nanoflowers' open‐pore morphology, reduced overpotential (η10 = 125 mV), smaller charge transfer resistance, long‐term stability, and a synergistic effect between various components, which allows the reactants to be more easily absorbed and subsequently converted into gaseous products during the water electrolysis process. DFT calculation also reveals that the introduction of Ag (222) surface into the Co9S8 (440)‐Ni3S2 (120) system increases the electronic density of states per unit cell of a system and significantly reduces the energy barriers of intermediates for OER, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER. This study showcases the innovation of employing trimetallic nanomaterials immobilized on a conductive, continuous porous three‐dimensional network formed on a nickel foam (NF) substrate as a highly efficient catalyst for OER.

Maximization the synergistic effect of each component in transition metal-carbon complexes is expected to improve the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis for rechargeable Zn-air batteries but is still challenging. Herein, nucleobase guanine is employed as a supramolecular precursor to generate the core (FeCo alloy)-shell (carbon) structure embedded in ultrathin graphene-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (FeCo@NCNSs) via a confinement pyrolysis strategy. Thanks to the generated core-shell structure and bimetallic synergistic effect, the as-prepared FeCo@NCNSs exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, when served as the bifunctional air electrode for a practical Zn-air battery, FeCo@NCNSs exhibits a higher open-circuit voltage (1.553 V) and peak power density (197.30 mW cm-2), as well as the greatly improved long-term cyclic stability compared to the noble metal benchmarks. This work provides a promising approach to integrate various active sites for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and inspires the exploration of simple but efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.

The advancement of electrocatalysts exhibiting outstanding performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), crucial for hydrogen production, holds immense significance in addressing energy shortages and mitigating environmental pollution. In this study, a novel approach to synthesizing Co-MOF (Metal-Organic Framework) directly immobilized onto a Ni foam substrate through hydrothermal synthesis is presented. In contrast to conventional methods employing powder-based synthesis with binders, our direct attachment method offers a unique and efficient means of creating robust Co-MOF at Ni foam (Co-MOF@NF) hybrid catalysts. Subsequently, a chemical reduction approach utilizing sodium borohydride was employed to introduce surface modification into the Co-MOF structure. The resulting material, sodium borohydride treated Co-MOF@NF (Red. 1 h Co-MOF@NF), exhibited a remarkable enhancement in OER activity compared to the pristine Co-MOF@NF sample. Notably, Red.1 h Co-MOF@NF demonstrated a substantially reduced overpotential of 235 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm⁻2, in contrast to the 300 mV overpotential required by the pristine Co-MOF@NF under the same conditions. Furthermore, the Red.1 h Co-MOF@NF catalyst displayed exceptional stability, sustaining a current density of 50 mA cm⁻2 for over 48 h, highlighting its promising potential for practical applications. The synergistic effects of direct hydrothermal attachment, surface modification, and improved OER performance make this study a significant contribution to the advancement of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffers a complex four-electron process with sluggish kinetics, which severely hinders its practical application. In general, Ni-based spinel-structured materials have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for OER. However, fabricating surface with high efficient Ni3+ active sites for Ni-based spinel is thermodynamically unfavorable, which impedes the future development and application of Ni-based spinel. In this study, we have formulated a octahedral (Oh) sites doping route for the synthesis of a Ni3+-riched Ni(Co1.98Ni0.02)O4. The results demonstrate that the catalyst with high density of surface Ni3+ active sites exhibits an improved OER catalytic activity compared with NiCo2O4 and requires a low overpotential of 349 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.

The current study focuses on the synthesis, characterization and investigation of the potential applications of azo chromophore functionalized polyesters and their composites with graphene derivatives. Employing the two-step diazotization coupling reaction, diazo diol monomers are synthesized. Subsequently, the azo polyesters are prepared via low-temperature solution polycondensation of the diazo diols with diacid chloride followed by the incorporation of graphene derivatives to obtain composite materials. Characterization techniques including Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-Visible Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are employed to evaluate the chain structure, degree of crystallinity, optical properties and morphology. Further, their electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and detection ability toward heavy metal ion was evaluated. The results demonstrate enhanced catalytic and detection capabilities attributed to synergistic interactions between polymer and graphene components. This study provides significant insights into the development of efficient polymer-graphene hybrid materials, with potential applications in green chemistry and environmental monitoring.

Abstract Electrochemical water-splitting is a promising green technology for the production of hydrogen. One of the bottlenecks, however, is the oxygen evolution half-reaction (OER), which could be overcome with the development of a suitable electrocatalyst. Recently, non-noble metal, high-entropy oxides (HEO) have been investigated as potential OER electrocatalysts, but complex synthesis approaches that usually produce the material in powder form limit their wider utilization. Here, an innovative synthesis strategy of formulating a nanostructured (CoFeNiMnCr) 3 O 4 HEO thin film on a CoFeNiMnCr high entropy alloy (HEA) using facile electrochemical and thermal treatment methods is presented. The CoFeNiMnCr HEA serves as exceptional support to be electrochemically treated in an ethylene glycol electrolyte with ammonium fluoride to form a rough and microporous structure with nanopits. The electrochemically treated CoFeNiMnCr HEA surface is more prone to oxidation during a low-temperature thermal treatment, leading to the growth of a spinel (CoFeNiMnCr) 3 O 4 HEO thin film. The (CoFeNiMnCr) 3 O 4 HEO exhibits a superior overpotential of 341 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec −1 along with remarkable long-term stability in alkaline media. The excellent catalytic activity and stability for the OER can serve as a promising platform for the practical utilization of (CoFeNiMnCr) 3 O 4 HEO. Graphical abstract

Given the energy crisis and escalating environmental pollution, the imperative for developing clean new energy is evident. Hydrogen has garnered significant attention owing to its clean properties, high energy density, and ease of storage and transportation. This study synthesized four types of catalysts—FeS(DI/MB), FeS(ET/MB), Fe(DI/MB), and Fe(ET/MB)—using two distinct solution systems: DI/MB and ET/MB. The FeS(DI/MB) catalyst, synthesized using the layered solution system (DI/MB), demonstrates a uniformly distributed and dense nanosheet structure, exhibiting excellent resistance to strong bases and superior catalytic properties. The FeS(DI/MB) electrode showed OER overpotentials of 460 mV and 318 mV in 1 M and 6 M, respectively, at current densities of up to 500 mA cm−2. Under industrial electrolysis test conditions, the FeS(DI/MB) electrode required only 262 mV to achieve a current density of 500 mA cm−2, operating in a high-temperature, strong alkaline environment of 6 M at 60 °C. Furthermore, the FeS(DI/MB) electrode exhibited excellent OER catalytic activity and stability, as evidenced by a 60 h stability test These findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of iron nickel sulfide-based catalysts, and further in-depth and comprehensive exploration is anticipated to yield the excellent catalytic performance of these catalysts in the realm of electrolytic water hydrogen production.

CoFe 2 O 4 –La 1− x Sr x CoO 3 ( x = 0.2, 0.6, 0.8) composites have been synthesized using a two‐step, low‐temperature wet chemical approach that combines coprecipitation and sol–gel techniques. The composite materials have been physicochemically analyzed using Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope. The electrocatalytic properties of the composite materials have been assessed in terms of their performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline medium. Cyclic voltammetry has been used for analyzing the redox behavior of the materials in 1 M KOH solution. The electrocatalytic activity of the materials has been assessed using anodic polarization curves on Ni substrate and the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode demonstrates excellent activity, with current densities of 11.1 mA cm −2 for OER and 47.4 mA cm −2 for MOR at 650 mV. Also, the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode has the maximum specific activity of 1.1 × 10 3 mA cm −2 g −1 at 650 mV toward OER. The electrodes’ stability has been assessed through chronoamperometric experiments and additional insight into the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity gained through the electrochemical surface area estimations using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. From chronoamperometric experiment, it has been observed that the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode attains stability within 114 s with a current density of 108.7 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters, including the standard enthalpy of activation (Δ H ° # ), standard entropy of activation (Δ S ° # ), and standard electrochemical energy of activation (), have been estimated by anodic polarization curve recorded in KOH as well as KOH with CH 3 OH solutions at various temperatures.

Oxygen evolution reaction at the anode consumes about 60–70% of the total power for the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), and power consumption can be greatly reduced by introducing hydrocarbon fuels such as methane into the anode for the oxidation reaction. In this work, rare-earth doped CeO2 is used as catalyst support and oxygen ion conductor with Ni serving as an active metal for methane oxidation at the SOEC anode. The catalyst is synthesized via stepwise hydrolysis and impregnation methods, and the influences of rare-earth oxides on the performance of CH4 thermal oxidation, SOEC anode oxidation and hydrogen production are studied. The results show that 5%Ni–Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ exhibits the optimal catalytic oxidation and electrolytic hydrogen production with the lowest cell voltage of 0.38 V at 0.4 A/cm2. The high performance is mainly attributed to the oxygen vacancy, oxygen ion conductivity, and active metal dispersion. It is supposed that oxygen evolution reaction and simultaneous methane oxidation with generated oxygen occur at the SOEC anode can reduce oxygen partial pressure, which results in the ultra-low voltage for hydrogen production.

For the photocatalytic water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction on transition-metal oxide photoanodes is well known to be the bottleneck. As strongly correlated materials, strong electron-phonon couplings in transition-metal oxides indicate that atomic vibrations can greatly modify electronic structure and transport properties. By combining density functional theory and molecular dynamics, we study the effects of finite-temperature atomic vibrations on the band gaps, electronic localization, polaron formation, absorption spectra, and the band-edge levels in $\ensuremath{\alpha}\text{\ensuremath{-}}{\mathrm{Fe}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$. Atomic vibrations are found to induce strong electronic localization near the band edges and facilitate the hole polaron formation, which can hinder the transport of the photogenerated holes. In addition, atomic vibrations push up the valence band edge, indicating an increased reaction barrier. This study identifies that atomic vibrations in transition-metal oxide photoanodes can limit the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction.

Abstract The increasing demand for clean hydrogen necessitates the rapid development of efficient photoanodes to catalyze the water oxidation half‐reaction effectively. Here a strategy is introduced to fabricate photoanodes that synergistically combine and leverage the properties of porous Ti‐doped hematite (Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 ) and graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) nanosheets anchored with in situ grown Ni‐doped CoP co‐catalyst (Ni‐CoP). The resulting hybrid photoanodes exhibit >7 times higher photocurrent density at +1.23 V RHE compared with Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 photoanodes. Comprehensive characterization techniques, including ambient photoemission spectroscopy, intensity‐modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, and transient absorption spectroscopy complementarily reveal the key impact of g‐C 3 N 4 in these composites with enhanced solar oxygen evolution reaction: The incorporation of g‐C 3 N 4 leads to enhanced charge separation through a type‐II heterojunction, thereby increasing the hole flux at the surface, and extending the charge carrier lifetime to the ms‐s range needed for water oxidation. Additionally, g‐C 3 N 4 facilitates efficient transfer of photogenerated holes to the fine Ni‐CoP nanoparticles confined in the graphitic matrix for a boosted oxygen evolution reaction. These findings highlight the advantages of complex heterostructure photoanodes and demonstrate a new application of g‐C 3 N 4 as a multifunctional support of co‐catalysts for future photoanodes with enhanced performance.

A Fe-Co dual-metal co-doped N containing the carbon composite (FeCo-HNC) was prepared by adjusting the ratio of iron to cobalt as well as the pyrolysis temperature with the assistance of functionalized silica template. Fe1Co-HNC, which was formed with 1D carbon nanotubes and 2D carbon nanosheets including a rich mesoporous structure, exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities. The ORR half-wave potential is 0.86 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), and the OER overpotential is 0.76 V at 10 mA cm−2 with the Fe1Co-HNC catalyst. It also displayed superior performance in zinc–air batteries. This method provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of efficient transition metal-based carbon catalysts.

Abstract Slow oxygen evolution kinetics and severe corrosion limit the further application of BiVO4 photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Here, BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanodes were synthetized aiming at improving its photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability. Compared with pure BiVO4 photoanode, the BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanode enhanced the photocurrent from 1.1 mA/cm2 to 4.5 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. In addition, Ni(OH)2 acted as a corrosion protection layer on the surface of the photoanode, allowing the BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanode to exhibit excellent stability.

It is fascinating and challenging to construct earth-abundant first-row transition metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for large-scale hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Here we report a progressive conversion from spinel nanosheets to layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets through the preferential dissolution of alternated layers in spinel. This process enables the formation of a lattice-matched and chemically bonded edge-to-edge spinel/LDH 2D/2D heterojunction. Significant charge redistribution at the 2D/2D heterointerface accelerates water dissociation kinetics and optimize adsorption energy of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing intermediates. The synthesized CoFe2O4/CoFe-LDH 2D/2D heterojunction demonstrates exceptional performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving an overpotential of 337 mV at a high current density of 1000 mA cm-2, surpassing previously reported non-noble metal-based spinels and LDHs. Furthermore, its oxygen evolution reaction performance is comparable to that of typical spinel and LDH catalysts. The in-depth insights can guide rational interfacial engineering of heterogeneous catalysts for energy and environmental applications.

Amorphous RuOx (a-RuOx) with disordered atomic arrangement and abundant coordinatively unsaturated Ru sites possesses high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the a-RuOx is prone to fast corrosion during OER in strong acid. Here, we realized the stabilization of an ultrathin a-RuOx layer via constructing heterointerface with crystalline α-MnO2 nanorods array (MnO2@a-RuOx). Benefiting from the strong electronic interfacial interaction, the as-formed MnO2@a-RuOx electrocatalyst display an ultralow overpotential of 128 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 and stable operation for over 100 h in 0.1 M HClO4. The assembled proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer reach 1 A cm-2 at applied cell voltage of 1.71 V. Extensive characterizations indicate the MnO2 substrate work as an electron donor pool to prevent the overoxidation of Ru sites and the OER proceeds in adsorbent evolution mechanism process without involving lattice oxygen. Our work provides a promising route to construct robust amorphous phase electrocatalysts.

Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) technology holds tremendous promise for large‐scale green hydrogen production. However, its widespread application faces significant constraints due to the limited lifespan of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in highly acidic and oxidative operating environments. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's structural degradation mechanism is imperative for the rational design of high‐performance acidic catalysts. In this review, the essence of the structural degradation of catalysts: and irreversible cationic and anionic overoxidation is initially unveiled. This is followed by an in‐depth exploration of their intricate relationship with the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). Then, state‐of‐the‐art characterization techniques for cationic and anionic overoxidation analysis are introduced. Subsequently, 4 cutting‐edge catalyst antioxidation strategies, including heterostructure engineering, doping strategy, nanostructuring, and phase engineering are systematically discussed, aiming to reveal their intrinsic factors for effectively inhibiting catalyst overoxidation. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospective insights into catalysts for PEMWE are delineated. The overarching goal of this review is to facilitate a fundamental understanding of catalyst structural degradation mechanisms and provide principal guidelines for the rational design of robust acidic OER catalysts.

Electrochemical reactions are those that occur on the surface of a charged catalyst, including carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction in total hydrolyzed water, anode fuel oxidation reaction, and cathode oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells and so on. Usually, active sites of these catalysts used in the aforementioned electrochemical reactions are noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Ru, which are limited by high cost and low reserves. In comparison, transition metals with low cost and high reserves are gradually used in these electrochemical fields, and have the potential to replace common noble metal catalytic materials. As a typical transition metal, copper is not the best choice as active site in catalysts for electrochemical reactions, but its properties offer unique characteristics in different electrochemical reactions. For example, in CO2RR process, moderate adsorption capacity of CO intermediates on Cu active site promotes the formation of a carbon-carbon bond, which will increase the proportion of multi-carbon products. In other electrochemical reactions, the use of copper can affect the electronic structure of other transition metal active sites to improve the catalytic capacity. Therefore, this chapter gives an overview of the application of copper used as active site or dopant in the field of electrochemistry.

The modification of Ir or oxygen vacancies (Vo) is a strategy to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of heterogeneous nanocatalysts. However, it is crucial to further clarify the synergistic effect of Ir and Vo on the enhancement mechanism of OER performance after surface reconstruction. In this work, FeCo Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) co-modified by Ir and Vo were successfully prepared by the thermodynamically favorable galvanic replacement reaction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that the synergistic effect of Ir and Vo enhanced the charge transfer of FeCo LDHs. XPS spectra reveal robust interactions between Ir and FeCo LDHs. Density-functional theory further reveals that the low-oxygen-coordinated Ir (III) acts as an active site to optimize the OER rate-determining step energy barrier. As a result, Ir and Vo co-modified FeCo LDH requires only a 203 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and, more importantly, operates stably at an industrial current density of 250 mA cm−2 for 312 h without degradation. This work provides new insights and avenues for understanding the enhanced performance mechanism of catalysts after surface reconstruction and for industrial scale-up production.

Li-O2 batteries have attracted much attention due to their high energy density. However, the high charging potential cause serious side reactions and safety issues. Designing catalysts is one of the mostly adopted strategies to decrease the charging potential. Herein, we propose a distinct strategy of electrochemical lithiation of Pd-CN to significantly reduce the overpotential of Li-O2 batteries from 4.28V to 3.25V and the underlying catalysis mechanism is revealed. The lithiation promotes the formation of N defects and the Li-Pd alloying, which improves the conductivity of the catalyst and increases the number of active sites. This promotes the oxygen evolution reaction and decreases the overpotential. Theoretical calculations are further used to prove that the electrochemically tuned Pd-CN with nitrogen vacancies exhibits a weak adsorption energy for LiO2, enabling a significant reduction in the charge potential. This study proposes a distinct and facile strategy to address the overpotential issue in Li-O2 batteries.

Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries are a family of promising energy storage systems. However, they face various challenges related to their lifetime, such as the Faradaic imbalance due to the occurrence of parasitic reaction leading to the fading of its energy storage capacity. Herein, automatization of a rebalancing system to reverse the detrimental effects of Faradaic imbalance due to the unavoidable presence of small quantities of oxygen in the negative reservoir is developed and implemented in an alkaline flow battery. A membrane‐free rebalancing cell is proposed to promote the oxygen evolution reaction and reverse the accumulated charge in the catholyte showing a 100% coulombic efficiency. The programmable logic controller monitors the open circuit voltage to calculate the charge stored in each charge / discharge step and closes a circuit so a fixed voltage is applied to the rebalancing cell when the battery needs to be rebalanced. The system is tested using an alkaline flow battery consisting of ferrocyanide and 2,6‐dihydroxyanthraquinone, improving the energy capacity retention from 0.27% cycle‐1 and 0.47% h‐1 without rebalancing system to 100% retention after >850 cycles and >24 days (without Ar‐filled glovebox), demonstrating the feasibility of this proposed system to address the Faradaic imbalance.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a very complex process with slow reaction kinetics and high overpotential, which is the main limitation for the commercial application of water splitting. Thus, it is of necessary to design high-performance OER catalysts. NiFe based layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) have recently gained a lot of attention due to their high reaction activity and simple manufacturing process. In this study, a novel electrocatalyst based on NiFe-LDH was constructed by introducing Ti3C2, which was utilized to modulate the structural and electronic properties of the electrocatalysts. Structural examinations reveal that the Ti3C2 of 2D structure successfully dope the NiFe-LDHs nanosheets, forming NiFe-LDH/Ti3C2 heterojunctions. Firstly, the heterojunction substantially reduces the charge transfer resistance, promoting the electron migration between the LDH nanosheets. Secondly, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier between the rate-determining step from *OH to *O is lowered, favoring the formation of the reaction intermediates and thus the occurrence of OER. As a result, the composite electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 334 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec, which are superior to those of the NiFe-LDH by 11.2% and 38.5%, respectively. This study provides inspiration for promoting the performances of NiFe based electrocatalysts by utilizing 2D materials.

Developing an efficient strategy for the universal synthesis of electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing the industrialization of water splitting, yet it remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose combustion-assisted corrosion engineering as a rapid method to fabricate electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within seconds. By utilizing a three-dimensional framework composed of nickel foam and the unique structure of the active species, we enable swift electrolyte diffusion and gas release. Consequently, the optimized S–NiO/NF exhibits remarkable OER catalytic activity, requiring a low overpotential of 236 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Notably, the reconfiguration during the OER process leads to the formation of actual catalytic active species, enhancing the number of active centers and thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This research presents a versatile method for industrially fabricating non-noble metal self-supporting electrodes with high efficiency, offering a practical solution for energy conversion and storage.

Multifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial for development of the key electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, for which single-atom catalyst (SAC) has present great promises. Very recently, some experimental works showed that structurally well-defined ultra-small transition-metal clusters (such as Fe and Co tetramers, denoted as Fe4 and Co4, respectively), can efficiently modulate the catalytic behavior of SACs by axial coordination. Herein, taking the graphene-supported MN4 SACs as representatives, we theoretically explored the feasibility of realizing multifunctional SACs for ORR, OER, and HER by this novel axial coordination engineering. Through extensive first-principles calculations, from 23 candidates, IrN4 decorated with Fe4 (IrN4/Fe4) is identified as the promising trifunctional catalyst with the theoretical overpotential of 0.43, 0.51, and 0.30 V for OER, ORR, and HER, respectively. RhN4/Fe4 and CoN4/Fe4 are recognized as potential OER and ORR bifunctional catalysts. In addition, NiN4/Fe4 exhibits the best ORR activity with an overpotential of 0.30 V, far superior to the pristine NiN4 SAC (0.88 V). Electronic structure analyses reveal that the significantly enhanced ORR activity can be ascribed to the orbital and charge redistribution of Ni active center, resulting from its electronic interaction with Fe4 cluster. This work could stimulate and guide the rational design of graphene-based multifunctional SACs realized by axial coordination of small TM clusters, and provide insights into the modulation mechanism.

The implementation of nanocomposite materials as electrode layers represents a potential turning point for next-generation of solid oxide cells in order to reduce the use of critical raw materials. However, the substitution of bulk electrode materials by thin films is still under debate especially due to the uncertainty about their performance and stability under operando conditions, which restricts their use in real applications. In this work, we propose a multiphase nanocomposite characterized by a highly disordered microstructure and high cationic intermixing as a result from thin-film self-assembly of a perovskite-based mixed ionic-electronic conductor (lanthanum strontium cobaltite) and a fluorite-based pure ionic conductor (samarium-doped ceria) as an oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells. Electrochemical characterization shows remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (fuel cell mode) and oxygen evolution activity (electrolysis mode) in comparison with state-of-the-art bulk electrodes, combined with outstanding long-term stability at operational temperatures of 700 ºC. The disordered nanostructure was implemented as a standalone oxygen electrode on commercial anode-supported cells, resulting in high electrical output in fuel cell and electrolysis mode for active layer thicknesses of only 200 nm (>95% decrease in critical raw materials with respect to conventional cathodes). The cell was operated for over 300 hours displaying excellent stability. Our findings unlock the hidden potential of advanced thin-film technologies for obtaining high-performance disordered electrodes based on nanocomposite self-assembly combining long durability and minimized use of critical raw materials.

Transition-metal species embedded in carbon have sparked intense interest in the fields of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, improvement of the electrocatalytic kinetics remains a challenge caused by the synergistic assembly. Here, we propose a biochemical strategy to fabricate the Co nanoparticles (NPs) and Co/Ni–N4–C co-embedded N-doped porous carbon (CoNPs&Co/Ni–N4–C@NC) catalysts via constructing the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)@yeast precursor. The rich amino groups provide the possibility for the anchorage of Co2+/Ni2+ ions as well as the construction of Co/Ni–ZIF@yeast through the yeast cell biomineralization effect. The functional design induces the formation of CoNPs and Co/Ni–N4–C sites in N-doped carbon as well as regulates the porosity for exposing such sites. Synergy of CoNPs, Co/Ni–N4–C, and porous N-doped carbon delivered excellent electrocatalytic kinetics (the ORR Tafel slope of 76.3 mV dec–1 and the OER Tafel slope of 80.4 mV dec–1) and a high voltage of 1.15 V at 10 mA cm–2 for the discharge process in zinc air batteries. It provides an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance catalysts.

Direct electrolysis of pH-neutral seawater for hydrogen generation is a promising method for storing renewable energy. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) faces a selectivity challenge, competing with chlorine evolution and confronting severe corrosion issues of the electrode. Here, we have synthesized ultrathin, polycrystalline, porous Co3O4 nanosheets with Pd single atoms (PdSA-Co3O4) for efficient and stable pH-neutral seawater decomposition. The octahedral Pd-O-Co active unit, generated by the synergistic coordination of the Pd single atom strong proton adsorption (SPA) material with Co3O4 nanosheets, resulted in PdSA-Co3O4 have activities 3, 5, and 31 times higher than Co3O4, IrO2, and commercial Co3O4, respectively. It also remained stable in pH-neutral seawater for 80 h. Operando in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations showed that synergistic interactions between the strong proton adsorption of Pd single atoms and the active site Co enhanced the adsorption of intermediates and significantly reduced the free energy of adsorption at the rate-determining step (O*→OOH*). The Pd-O-Co active units inhibited the transformation of the dynamic structure of the Co3O4 substrate and reduced the corrosive effect of Cl ions during the OER process.

While dual-atom catalysts benefiting from synergetic interatomic interactions have inspired the development of emerging catalysts, the role of atomic interactions on the catalytic selectivity and activity has yet to be clearly discovered. Herein, two-types of Pt dual-atom active sites, Pt dimers (2Pt) with an interatomic distance of 2.6 Å and Pt pairs (Pt2) at a distance of 0.9 Å, are fabricated by anchoring onto cationic vacancy-rich nickel-based hydroxide (Pt@NiFeCo-E). It reveals that 2Pt sites are favorable for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while Pt2 sites are active towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The coexistence of two types of Pt dual atoms endows the bifunctional activity, which reached an overpotential of 14 mV@10 mA cm−2 for HER, an overpotential of 234 mV@100 mA cm−2 for OER, and an effective overall water splitting reaction (OWS) in alkaline at an overpotential of 1.42 V to reach 10 mA cm−2 and at 100 mA cm−2 for 50 h. This work not only clarifies a new mechanism in manipulating the selectivity of dual-atom catalysts via controlling the interatomic distance, but also paves a pathway for designing novel high-efficient bifunctional catalysts.

Water electrolysis is one promising and eco‐friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In response, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2‐xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best‐performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500% current density promotion at overpotential η = 300 mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe‐based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni:Fe ratio rather than Fe content in all metal elements. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2‐xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large‐scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.

Multimetallic oxide configuration and hollow structure construction are effective strategies for the design of efficient electrocatalysts, which can regulate the intrinsic properties of the active sites, enlarge the specific surface areas and expose more active sites. In this work, hollow-structured CuCo-based ternary metal oxides supported nitrogen-carbon networks (HS-CuMCoOx, M=Fe/Zn/Ni) derived from ZIF-67 hollow spheres were fabricated through facile ion exchange and heat treatment. The prepared composites possess hollow configurations with homogeneously dispersed trimetallic active species on the shells. Among all the ternary metallic derivatives, hollow spheres supporting Cu, Fe, and Co oxides (HS-CuFeCoOx) exhibited highest electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The improved OER performance ascribed to the inherent electrocatalytic properties of the ternary metal active species and microstructure by hollow structure design and heat treatment, which offered an effective synthetic strategy for the fabrication of trimetallic oxide composites for as OER electrocatalysts.

The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) plays a critical role in direct hydrazine fuel cells and presents a promising alternative to the kinetics-sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in water reduction. Engineering catalysts with high-density multifold nanotwin structures has emerged as a compelling strategy to enhance catalytic activity. However, the exploration of multifold nanotwins for HzOR applications remains absent. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a porous Ni-Zn-Cu catalyst featuring high-density twofold and fivefold nanotwins. The Ni-Zn-Cu catalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni-Zn-Cu/Ni foam) exhibits exceptionally high catalytic activity and stability toward the HzOR, achieving a current density of 204.3 mA·cm-2 at 0.0 V vs. RHE and retaining up to 89.1% after 20 hours of continuous electrolysis. Online mass spectrometer (MS) analysis indicates that the Ni-Zn-Cu coating facilitates N-N bond cleavage of N2H4. This study offers valuable insights into the development of multifold nanotwin catalysts for advancing HzOR applications.

Seawater Electrolysis is an exciting alternative to freshwater electrolysis; however, it suffers from a multitude of issues that must be resolved before the technology can be scaled. Corrosive hypochlorite forms at the anode of seawater electrolysis and can damage catalysts and electrolyzer components. Hypochlorite is unstable and can decay, particularly when exposed to heat and metal ions, which can lead to erroneously high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) selectivity conclusions, resulting in poor catalyst and electrolyzer component selection. In this study, we use the rotating ring-disc electrode technique to characterize the selectivity of IrO 2 , NiO, Co 3 O 4 , RuO 2 , Pt and PtRu electrocatalysts in situ at near-neutral pH (8.4) with linear scan voltammetry (LSV), potentiostatic and galvanostatic experiments. Our findings reveal that elevated temperatures are conducive to higher OER selectivity. Furthermore, when we increased the chloride concentration in the electrolyte with an IrO 2 catalyst, we observed that although the overall selectivity towards the OER reaction decreased, the OER current independently increased, indicating a synergistic relationship.

Advancing efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for commercializing emerging energy devices. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose doping different transition metal (TM) atoms to regulate the electronic structures of the two-dimensional 1T-HfTe2 monolayer to achieve bifunctional catalysis for the ORR/OER. Due to the small electronegativity of the Hf atom, we found the doped TMs can generally form anion centers by accepting abundant charges from the Hf interlayer. At the same time, the highly conductive 1T-HfTe2 contributes to the charge transfer between the active center and the reaction intermediates, rendering the designed SACs the tunable activity for the reactions. By comparing the theoretical overpotentials of ORR and OER on 15 single-atom catalysts (SACs), Pt-doped system exhibits excellent catalytic activity for both ORR and OER, outperforming the traditional Pt(1 1 1) and RuO2(1 1 0) catalysts. Based on the charge transfer mechanism, we clarified that the doped TM atoms act as a 'bridge' to transfer the electrons from the substrate to the reaction intermediates, thereby effectively contributing to the improvement of catalytic activity. In summary, our study shows that, by doping appropriate TM atoms, the intrinsic inert HfTe2 can be activated toward efficient ORR/OER. This could provide some guidance for the design of new two-dimensional ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst materials.

We combined ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface science techniques, electrochemical measurements, and computational modeling to investigate electrocatalytic systems that are crucial components of the carbon management effort, including oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). Well-defined Model catalysts were grown on substrates in the UHV chamber and characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Selected model electrocatalysts were then tested in electrochemical cells to establish the structure-property relationships in OER and CO2RR. Our results showed that the edge sites of Fe2O3 grown on Au(111) were the most active toward OER and incorporation of Ni at the edge sites (NiFeOx) further boosted their OER activity. We also resolved the size-dependent electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion of the Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with average particle diameter between 2 to 6 nm: smaller diameter (< 3 nm) particles favored H2 evolution reaction (HER) due to a high population of Ag edge sites, whereas larger diameter particles favored CO2RR as the population of Ag(100) surface sites grew. We further discovered that electronic interactions between small diameter Ag particles and highly defective carbon supports could break the size-dependent CO2RR selectivity, resulting in highly selective (CO Faradaic Efficiency > 90%) and active Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with sizes < 2 nm diameter.

The development of silicon (Si) photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation is highly crucial for the progress of solar‐driven hydrogen production. Apart from the typical water oxidation reaction or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is gaining more attention due to favorable thermodynamics. In this work, we study Si photoanodes modified with electrodeposited copper‐nickel (CuNi) alloy for OER and UOR. The optimized photoanodes exhibit a low onset potential of 1.15 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a current density of 6 mA cm‐2 at 1.23 V vs RHE (the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation) for OER. Further, CuNi alloy‐modified photoanodes can drive the UOR at a lower onset potential (1.05 V vs RHE) and generate a higher current density of 31 mA cm‐2 at 1.23 V vs RHE. Importantly, the CuNi alloy can extend the stability for UOR under PEC conditions when compared to a planar Ni film deposited by a vacuum‐based process. This work demonstrates that CuNi alloy can further improve the properties of inhomogeneous metal‐insulator‐semiconductor Si photoanodes which can be efficiently utilized for both OER and UOR.

In addressing the challenging quest for an efficient electrocatalyst in electrochemical water splitting, we demonstrate an Fe-doped NiO nanosheet array anchored on nickel foam synthesized via a two-step process. Demonstrating exceptional performance in an alkaline electrolyte, FeNiO catalysts exhibit the oxygen evolution reaction with a low potential of 1.52 V vs RHE and the urea oxidation reaction of 1.32 V vs RHE @ 10 mA/cm2. The bifunctional electrolyzer generates 10 mA/cm2 current at 1.95 V for water and 1.59 V for urea electrolysis at ambient temperature. Promisingly, the FeNiO catalyst based electrolyzer generates hydrogen at an industrial-scale current density of 400 mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of just 1.91 V in concentrated alkaline electrolyte and elevated temperature (80 °C) due to the dimensionally stable and robust behavior of the self-supported catalyst. The activation energy for alkaline water electrolysis is found to be 52 kJ/mol. The present catalysts also demonstrate stable performance at 300 mA/cm2 in 4 M KOH electrolyte at 50 °C for more than 20 h. The synergy induced by Fe doping into NiO activates catalytic sites, expediting charge transfer and reaction kinetics. The present research report highlights the potential of catalysts as a practical and cost-effective approach for green hydrogen production via water splitting.

Utilization of widely available seawater for hydrogen generation using robust electrolysis methods can provide sustainable solutions to energy carriers. Sea waves at the same time provide abundant renewable energy that can produce the electricity required for seawater electrolysis. This work presents a novel design for a self-powered hydrogen generation based on membrane-less seawater electrolysis integrated with spring-assisted spherical triboelectric nanogenerators. To streamline fabrication and minimize maintenance expenses, water electrolysis is conducted in a membrane-less electrochemical cell reactor. Employing a mathematical model, the system's performance is analyzed across different catalysts, electrolytes, and operational temperatures. The modeling outcomes indicate that elevating the cell's temperature can lower the necessary potential, enhancing overall electrochemical cell efficiency and decreasing capacitor charging duration. The voltage required for the cell to reach 100 mA cm−2 in the seawater decreases from 2.4 V to 1.9 V as the cell temperature increase from 25 °C to 70 °C. This is due to the decline in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction overpotentials for NPNNS and Ti supported PtPd from 351 mV to 246 mV and 568 mV–394 mV, respectively. Furthermore, increase in the temperature results in an additional 19 % improvement in cell efficiency from 78 % to 97 % and producing hydrogen per cycle during electrolysis of seawater increase from 0.015 μmole to 0.020 μmole.

Abstract Seawater electrolysis is a potentially cost‐effective approach to green hydrogen production, but it currently faces substantial challenges for its high energy consumption and the interference of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER). Replacing the energy‐demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising alternative, as the MOR occurs at a significantly low anodic potential, which cannot only reduces the voltage needed for electrolysis but also completely circumvents the ClER. To this end, developing high‐performance MOR catalysts is a key. Herein, we report a novel quaternary Pt 1.8 Pd 0.2 CuGa/C intermetallic nanoparticles (i‐NPs) catalyst, which shows a high mass activity (11.13 A mg PGM −1 ), a large specific activity (18.13 mA cm PGM −2 ), and outstanding stability toward alkaline MOR. Advanced in‐situ surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), online differential mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically distributed Pd in Pt 2 CuGa intermetallic markedly promotes the oxidation of key reaction intermediates by enriching electron concentration around Pt sites, resulting in weak adsorption of carbon‐containing intermediates and favorable adsorption of the synergistic OH − groups near Pd sites. Using Pt 1.8 Pd 0.2 CuGa/C i‐NPs as anodic catalysts, we demonstrate MOR‐assisted seawater electrolysis that continuously operates under 1.23 V for 240 h in simulated seawater and 120 h in natural seawater without notable degradation, showing great potential for energy‐saving and cost‐competitive hydrogen production from seawater.

5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) offers a promising avenue to achieve energy-saving H2 production and produce value-added chemicals. However, the lack of HMFOR electrocatalysts with large current density and high selectivity impedes the whole productivity. Herein, an Ni3P-Cu3P heterojunction grown on Cu foam (Ni3P-Cu3P/CF) was successfully constructed, achieving large current density (300 mA cm-2 at 1.60 V vs. RHE) and high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency (>99%) for HMFOR. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the interface charge redistributes at the Ni3P-Cu3P heterointerface, resulting into the charge-deficiency Ni3P and charge-accumulation Cu3P. The charge-deficiency Ni3P induced by charge-attracting Cu3P favors to form more high-valence Ni species, which facilitates to optimize the adsorption of HMF and OH⁎ species for improving current density and decreasing potential, while the charge-accumulation Cu3P enables to broaden the potential window by suppressing competitive oxygen evolution reaction, thus elevating the conversion rate and selectivity of products. Benefiting from the excellent performance of Ni3P-Cu3P/CF for HMFOR, when constructing a HMFOR-assisted H2 production system using Ni3P-Cu3P/CF and self-prepared MoNiNx/NF as anode and cathode, the energy consumption was substantially decreased to 3.8 kW•h/Nm3 relative to that of pure water splitting (4.66 kW•h/Nm3). Our work is instructive for achieving low energy consumption of H2 production and synthesis of valuable chemicals by constructing heterojunction.

This study examines the catalytic activity of NiFeCoOx catalysts for anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. The catalysts were synthesized with a Ni to Co ratio of 2:1 and Fe content ranges from 2.5 to 12.5 wt%. The catalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The catalytic activity of the NiFeCoOx catalysts was evaluated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) experiments for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst with 5% Fe content exhibited the highest catalytic activity, achieving an overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Long-term catalyst testing for the OER at 50 mA cm−2 showed stable electrolysis operation for 100 h. The catalyst was further analyzed in an AEM water electrolyzer in a single-cell test, and the NiFeCoOx catalyst with 5% Fe at the anode demonstrated the highest current densities of 1516 mA cm−2 and 1620 mA cm−2 at 55 °C and 70 °C at 2.1 V. The maximum current density of 1880 mA cm−2 was achieved at 2.2 V and 70 °C. The Nyquist plot analysis of electrolysis at 55 °C showed that the NiFeCoOx catalyst with 5% Fe had lower activation resistance compared with the other Fe loadings, indicating enhanced performance. The durability test was performed for 8 h, showing stable AEM water electrolysis with minimum degradation. An overall cell efficiency of 70.5% was achieved for the operation carried out at a higher current density of 0.8 A cm−2.

Developing efficient hole transport layers and water oxidation electrocatalysts is vital for improving the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices for water-splitting. In this work, we synthesized Co3O4 nanoparticles/Ti3C2-MXene hybrid material and utilized it as a dual-function material to transport the photogenerated holes and catalyze the water oxidation reaction. It was found that the modification of BiVO4 with Co3O4/Ti3C2-MXene prolonged the lifetime of the photogenerated holes by 13.7-fold (i.e. from 0.26 s for BiVO4 to 3.56 s for Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4) and significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance. The modification of BiVO4 with only Ti3C2-MXene resulted in significant surface recombination more likely due to the high concentration of the accumulated holes in the Mxene layer because of its low electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation reaction. Employing the Co3O4/Ti3C2-MXene hybrid materials reduced significantly the rate constant of surface recombination and dramatically enhanced the charge transfer efficiency (i.e. from 0.17% for BiVO4 to 14.0% for Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4 at 0.65 VRHE). Under optimized conditions, the Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4 photoanode was able to deliver 5.05 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE and outperforms Ti3C2/BiVO4 and Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanodes. Moreover, it showed high stability for over 50 hours and reached a Faradaic efficiency of 90%. An applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) value of 1.71% at 0.62 VPt was obtained for the overall water splitting. This work provides a facile method to reduce surface recombination and enhance the stability and PEC efficiency of BiVO4 photoanodes via modification with dual-function oxygen evolution catalyst/hole transport layer hybrid materials.

Abstract Double-atom catalysts (DACs) have open up novel paradigms in the field of rapidly developing atomic catalysis because of their great potential to promote catalytic performances in various reaction systems. However, increasing the loading and extending the service life of metal active centers represents a grand challenge for the efficient utilization of DACs. Here, we rationally design asymmetric nitrogen, sulfur-coordinated diatomic iron centers on highly defective nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (denoted as A-Fe2S1N5/SNC, A: asymmetric), which possesses the atomic configuration of N2S1Fe-FeN3 moiety. The abundant defects and low-electronegativity heteroatoms in the carbon-based framework endow the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC with a high loading of 6.72 wt%. Furthermore, the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC demonstrates an ultra-low overpotential of 193 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm− 2, outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalysts. In addition, the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC exhibits extraordinary stability, maintaining > 97% activity for over 2000 hours during the OER process. This work provides a practical scheme for simultaneously balancing activity and stability of DACs toward electrocatalysis applications.

The wettability of polymers is usually inadequate to ensure the appropriate spreading of polar liquids and thus enable the required adhesion of coatings. A standard ecologically benign method for increasing the polymer wettability is a brief treatment with a non-equilibrium plasma rich in reactive oxygen species and predominantly neutral oxygen atoms in the ground electronic state. The evolution of the surface wettability of selected aromatic polymers was investigated by water droplet contact angles deposited immediately after exposing polymer samples to fluxes of oxygen atoms between 3 × 1020 and 1 × 1023 m−2s−1. The treatment time varied between 0.01 and 1000 s. The wettability evolution versus the O-atom fluence for all aromatic polymers followed similar behavior regardless of the flux of O atoms or the type of polymer. In the range of fluences between approximately 5 × 1020 and 5 × 1023 m−2, the water contact angle decreased exponentially with increasing fluence and dropped to 1/e of the initial value after receiving the fluence close to 5 × 1022 m−2.

The evolution of oxide scales on a 9Cr–1Mo ferritic-martensitic steel (T91) in oxygen-saturated liquid LBE at 500 °C was investigated. While taken out at around 500 °C, the T91 steel, after corrosion, shows clean surface with little LBE adhesion due to the poor wettability induced by surface oxides, due to the formation of an oxide layer. The results reveal the evolution of surface oxides from irregular strip shapes to regular crystalline grains, and stack-packed equiaxed crystals in the outer magnetite layer. Thermally-induced cracks were captured in the oxide scale on T91 steel after 1,000 h exposure to LBE. A new oxidation mechanism is proposed, with consideration of the formation of the outer layer by metal dissolution/oxide precipitation, and a thin film of chromium oxide at the inner/outer layers interface. The dependency of temperature and oxygen concentration on the oxidation kinetics of T91 steel in LBE at the present condition is discussed.

Abstract Photosynthetic organisms, fungi, and animals comprise distinct pathways for vitamin C biosynthesis. Besides this diversity, the final biosynthetic step consistently involves an oxidation reaction carried out by the aldonolactone oxidoreductases. Here, we study the origin and evolution of the diversified activities and substrate preferences featured by these flavoenzymes using molecular phylogeny, kinetics, mutagenesis, and crystallographic experiments. We find clear evidence that they share a common ancestor. A flavin-interacting amino acid modulates the reactivity with the electron acceptors, including oxygen, and determines whether an enzyme functions as an oxidase or a dehydrogenase. We show that a few side chains in the catalytic cavity impart the reaction stereoselectivity. Ancestral sequence reconstruction outlines how these critical positions were affixed to specific amino acids along the evolution of the major eukaryotic clades. During Eukarya evolution, the aldonolactone oxidoreductases adapted to the varying metabolic demands while retaining their overarching vitamin C-generating function.

Paleontological and phylogenomic observations have shed light on the evolution of cyanobacteria. Nevertheless, the emergence of heterocytes, specialized cells for nitrogen fixation, remains unclear. Heterocytes are surrounded by heterocyte glycolipids (HGs), which contribute to protection of the nitrogenase enzyme from oxygen. Here, by comprehensive HG identification and screening of HG biosynthesis genes throughout cyanobacteria, we identify HG analogs produced by specific and distantly related non-heterocytous cyanobacteria. These structurally less complex molecules probably acted as precursors of HGs, suggesting that HGs arose after a genomic reorganization and expansion of ancestral biosynthetic machinery, enabling the rise of cyanobacterial heterocytes in an increasingly oxygenated atmosphere. Subsequently, HG chemical structure evolved convergently in response to environmental pressures. Our results open a new chapter in the potential use of diagenetic products of HGs and HG analogs as fossils for reconstructing the evolution of multicellularity and division of labor in cyanobacteria.

Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e– oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy‐intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e– oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial‐level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50‒421 mA cm‒2 with 84‒100% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856‒7842 μmol cm‐2 h‐1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low‐current electrolysis. Finite‐element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e– oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.

Employing the Cooper-Rushton-Grimes (CRG) interatomic empirical potential with new parameters for U3+ interactions in U1-y,PuyO2-x, classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the first time to compute the enthalpy, the lattice parameter, the elastic constants and derived properties of hypostoichiometric U1-y,PuyO2-x compounds (with y in the range 0-1, x between 1.92-2.0, and from 1000 K to melting points). As hypostoichiometry results from adding oxygen vacancies to U1-y,PuyO2, this study investigates how oxygen vacancies affect the thermodynamic and thermomechanical properties of MOX compounds. The most pronounced effect appears at high temperatures, where the so-called Bredig transition occurs. We observed that the effects of this transition on the properties are softened by the presence of oxygen vacancies. The analytical law of the heat capacity for stoichiometric mixed-oxide fuels U1-y,PuyO2 developed by Bathellier et al. [9] was modified by introducing the deviation from stoichiometry as a variable. It was fitted on Molecular Dynamics data of heat capacity and linear thermal expansion coefficient and a good agreement was found. To model the thermal evolution of mechanical properties up to melting point, a new law was developed. The laws may be used in Fuel Performance Codes.

Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital malformations that occur in adults and children, with differences in distribution and presentation. We present the case of a newborn who initiated respiratory distress from the first minutes of life, presenting with hypoventilation and rightward displacement of the cardiac impulse, requiring oxygen therapy and intubation. The first radiograph shows a left pulmonary emphysema. The computerized axial tomography revealed a large mediastinal mass causing an obstructive syndrome of the left bronchus. The mass was successfully excised, resulting in a favorable clinical evolution. Although the presentation of our case is exceptional, it is worth noting that while most bronchogenic cysts are asymptomatic, they can occur in childhood, even from birth, as in our case.

The Early Tonian period in the São Francisco Craton represents the development of an intracontinental rift across the northern and central Espinhaço regions, playing a crucial role in understanding the tectonic evolution of the Neoproterozoic Period within this craton and its adjacent orogens. This rift is associated with the breakup of the São Francisco paleoplate, marked by the formation of several rifts, some of which were aborted (e.g. Santo Onofre Rift), and magmatism associated. Field investigations, coupled with petrographic, lithogeochemical, and U-Pb geochronological data of the Serra do Meio Suite, elucidate key characteristics and offer significant insights into the Tonian tectonic evolution of the São Francisco Craton and its relationship with Santo Onofre Rift. The suite comprises metagranitoids exhibiting a mineralogical composition spanning from alkali-feldspar granites to granites and its petrogenesis and tectonic characteristics reveal an alkaline to calc-alkalic signature, exhibiting extreme ferroan geochemistry and indications of moderate to high oxygen fugacity. Pressure estimations suggest low-pressure conditions during magma crystallization, implying shallow crustal emplacement. The suite's evolution involves complex petrogenetic processes, likely influenced by fractional crystallization and contamination by country rocks from a quartz-feldspathic crustal source, as well as a possible contribution from juvenile tholeiitic mantle sources associated with rift environments, showcasing a signature typical of A1-type granite. The U-Pb SHRIMP age, determined as 930 ± 2 Ma (MSWD = 0.34), is interpreted as the crystallization age of the rock and allows us to connect it to the opening of the Santo Onofre-Macaúbas Rift in the São Francisco Craton.

Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a major public health concern. Antibiotic intermediates (AIs) used in the production of semisynthetic antibiotics have the same bioactive structure as parent antibiotics and synthetic antibiotic production wastewater usually contains high concentrations of residual AIs; however, the effects of AIs and their interactive effects with antibiotics on the emergence of AR are unknown. In this study, antibiotic-sensitive E. coli K12 was exposed to five types of β-lactam AIs and their parent antibiotic ampicillin to analyze their impact on the evolution of multiple AR. The results indicated that AI 6-APA inhibits bacterial growth and stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species, as well as induces AR and antibiotic persistence like the parent antibiotic AMP. Combined exposure to 6-APA and AMP synergistically stimulated the induction of multiple AR and antibiotic persistence. The resistance mutation frequency increased up to 6.1×106-fold under combined exposure and the combination index reached 1326.5, indicating a strong synergy of 6-APA and AMP. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that these effects were associated with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, enhanced stress response signatures, and activation of efflux pumps. These findings provide evidence and mechanistic insights into AR induction by AIs in antibiotic production wastewater.

Abstract Rechargeable Li‐CO 2 batteries are considered as a promising carbon‐neutral energy storage technology owing to their ultra‐high energy density and efficient CO 2 capture capability. However, the sluggish CO 2 reduction/evolution kinetics impedes their practical application, which leads to huge overpotentials and poor cyclability. Multi‐element transit metal oxides (TMOs) are demonstrated as effective cathodic catalysts for Li‐CO 2 batteries. But there are no reports on the integration of defect engineering on multi‐element TMOs. Herein, the oxygen vacancy‐bearing Li‐Ni‐Co‐Mn multi‐oxide (Re‐NCM‐H3) catalyst with the α ‐NaFeO 2 ‐type structure is first fabricated by annealing the NiCoMn precursor that derived from spent ternary LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathode, in H 2 at 300 °C. As demonstrated by experimental results and theory calculations, the introduction of moderate oxygen vacancy has optimized electronic state near the Fermi level (E f ), eventually improving CO 2 adsorption and charge transfer. Therefore, the Li‐CO 2 batteries with Re‐NCM‐H3 catalyst deliver a high capacity (11808.9 mAh g −1 ), a lower overpotential (1.54 V), as well as excellent stability over 216 cycles at 100 mA g −1 and 165 cycles at 400 mA g −1 . This study not only opens up a sustainable application of spent ternary cathode, but also validates the potential of multi‐element TMO catalysts with oxygen defects for high‐efficiency Li‐CO 2 batteries.

The advent of FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) has brought forth a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, showcasing remarkable normal cell sparing effects with ultra-high dose rates (>40 Gy/s). This review delves into the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of FLASH effect, examining both physicochemical and biological hypotheses in cell biophysics. The physicochemical process encompasses oxygen depletion, reactive oxygen species, and free radical recombination. In parallel, the biological process explores the FLASH effect on the immune system and on blood vessels in treatment sites such as the brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. This review investigated the selective targeting of cancer cells and the modulation of the tumor microenvironment through FLASH-RT. Examining these mechanisms, we explore the implications and challenges of integrating FLASH-RT into cancer treatment. The potential to spare normal cells, boost the immune response, and modify the tumor vasculature offers new therapeutic strategies. Despite progress in understanding FLASH-RT, this review highlights knowledge gaps, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize its clinical applications. The synthesis of physicochemical and biological insights serves as a comprehensive resource for cell biology, molecular biology, and biophysics researchers and clinicians navigating the evolution of FLASH-RT in cancer therapy.

The present study investigates the sparsely documented tribological performance of selective laser-melted Ti-6Al-4V over a wide range of temperatures (room temperature to 450 °C). The evolution of wear mechanism was traced by examining the phase changes, chemical composition, and morphology of wear tracks in the material. The native oxide layer developed on the surface of the material was found to mitigate adhesive wear during dry sliding at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, this oxide layer contributed to oxidative wear, as evidenced by the formation of a tribo-oxide layer with increased oxygen penetration. Further, abrasive wear was found to increase with increasing temperatures, which could be attributed to the presence of entrapped oxidized wear particles (third-body wear) and material softening.

Abstract Complex liquid–solid reactions occur during brazing. A deep understanding of brazing liquid evolution is therefore of important concern for the bonding between filler and substrates. The joining of gas‐pressure‐sintered silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) ceramic to oxygen‐free copper (OFC) foil was prepared using Ag–Cu–TiH 2 filler at 875°C for 0.5 h. The effect of the Ag:Cu ratio on the interfacial microstructure and peeling strength of the joints was analyzed. The reaction of brazing liquid with Si 3 N 4 ceramic includes reactions with both the β‐Si 3 N 4 and the grain boundary phases (Y–Si–Mg–O–N). The resulting interfacial reaction products include TiN, Ti 5 Si 3 , and potential Cu 3 Ti 3 O. Based on the phase composition and three‐dimensional morphology of the interfacial reaction products in the Si 3 N 4 ceramic/OFC foil joints, a model for the evolution of the brazing liquid as the reaction proceeds was proposed. Peeling test results indicated that the peeling strength of the joints rises unilaterally with the increase of the Ag:Cu ratio in the filler until reaching the peak value of 24.3 N/mm at the maximum Ag:Cu ratio of 90:10. The mechanisms of the joint peeling fracture were discussed in detail.

Due to the ever‐increasing demand for high‐quality steel and the need to reduce CO 2 emissions, research and development of sustainable steelmaking processes have gained a lot of interest in the past decade. One of these processes is the hydrogen plasma smelting reduction (HPSR), which has proven to be a promising solution for iron ore reduction where water vapor is formed instead of CO 2 . However, due to the highly dynamic and sometimes unpredictable behavior of plasmas and their nonlinear interaction with the liquid oxides, the monitoring and control of the underlying processes must be improved. This article explores the usage of optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and image analysis for HPSR process monitoring at laboratory and pilot scale. The results cover the time evolution of the OES and camera data with the focus on the most interesting radiating species, such as atomic hydrogen, iron, and oxygen together with the FeO molecule. In addition, the advantages, disadvantages, and requirements of these methods for HPSR process monitoring are discussed.

The utilization of NH3, a carbon-free hydrogen carrier, can be optimized through its co-combustion with solids. However, prior studies have primarily focused on coal as the solid fuel, which entails its consumption. Considering that hydrochar possesses abundant oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as high mass and energy density, it presents itself as a promising alternative solid fuel to coal, thereby decreasing dependence on fossil fuels. Therefore, this study investigates the co-combustion of different proportions of hydrochar, NH3, and O2. Molecular dynamic simulations using the ReaxFF MD method were conducted to investigate the impact of temperature on combustion by analyzing product distribution, evolution of bonds, and gas characteristic curves. Additionally, N migration was examined to elucidate the processes leading to the generation of N2 and NOx from NH3. The results showed that temperature facilitated the progression of combustion as the total number of molecules increased (from 2614 at 2000 K to 3137 at 2500 K) and variety of products expanded (from 48 at 2000 K to 69 at 2500 K) with increasing temperature. With increasing temperature, the descent rate of NH3 and oxygen accelerated, whereas the quantities of H2 and H2O increased. Furthermore, during combustion, hydrochar underwent three stages: initial coke formation, subsequent tar generation, and organic gas production. Second, during N migration, hydrochar directly or indirectly participated in the formation of N2. In this process, hydrochar indirectly contributed to the formation of NH and NH2 intermediates, leading to the formation of N2. In contrast, the majority of NO was formed through the direct decomposition of hydrochar. Finally, because of the limited quantity of generated NO2, N existed primarily in the form of N2 and NO. These findings provide theoretical guidance for the combustion of NH3 using hydrochar.

Abstract Gondwana developed marine platforms at its northern edge with Paleozoic deposits reflecting varied paleoclimatic conditions. In the northwestern (NW) Iberian Peninsula (NW Gondwana), Ordovician black-grey shales and sandstones were deposited in these platforms at southern polar latitudes. The current research contributes to a better understanding of the recycling, climate, and redox conditions during the deposition of black-grey shales in the low/mid-Ordovician period. During the Lower-Middle Ordovician period, the black-grey shales recorded an increase in recycling (Th/Sc, Zr/Sc, Zr/Ti, La/Th), low level of chemical alteration (CIA, Th/U) and relatively low oxygen conditions (Ce/Ce*, Y/Ho). These data indicate arid-cold conditions with a seasonal glacial-periglacial environment, consistent with the location of the NW Iberian Peninsula at low latitudes close to the South Pole. Towards the Middle Ordovician, the black-grey shales recorded a more temperate climate with higher levels of chemical alteration, less recycling, and a relatively more oxygenated environment, what suggests a transition to a moderate climate with no glacial events developed. This climate evolution could have been promoted by the progressive Gondwana drift away from the south pole aided by CO2 input to the atmosphere from alkaline mafic intraplate volcanism linked with a previous felsic LIP event in this area. The rapid decline of this volcanism and the partial alteration of its products (fixing CO2) could have contributed to the development of the Hirnantian glacial conditions during the Upper Ordovician, which brings a new view of the secular climatic evolution of the Earth during the Ordovician.

Earth-abundant and effective electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting process have seen an exceptional rise in research over the past few years. Among these, synthesis of active, long-lasting materials that act as bifunctional electrocatalysts in an alkaline environment is a crucial step for the development of perovskite-based electrocatalysts. Herein, perovskite type BaNi1-xCoxO3; x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5; prepared by economic solution combustion method is reported with regard to its oxygen and hydrogen evolution activity in 1.0 M KOH. The benchmark current density of 10 mAcm−2 was reached by BaNi0.7Co0.3O3 (BC3) with the lowest overpotential of 279 mV and 419 mV for OER and HER respectively. Furthermore, BC3 showed a phenomenal bifunctional electrocatalytic property with an overall cell voltage of 1.98 V at 10 mAcm−2 in a two-electrode system. A gain by 92 mV in overall electrocatalytic activity of BC3 was recorded after 24 h of constant splitting of water at 30 mAcm−2 makes it an interesting bifunctional electrocatalyst best suited for large scale hydrogen production through water electrolyser.

Composite oxides have been widely applied in the hydrogenation of CO/CO2 to methanol or as the component of bifunctional oxide–zeolite for the synthesis of hydrocarbon chemicals. However, it is still challenging to disentangle the stepwise formation mechanism of CH3OH at working conditions and selectively convert CO2 to hydrocarbon chemicals with narrow distribution. Here, we investigate the reaction network of the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol over a series of spinel oxides (AB2O4), among which the Zn-based nanostructures offer superior performance in methanol synthesis. Through a series of (quasi) in situ spectroscopic characterizations, we evidence that the dissociation of H2 tends to follow a heterolytic pathway and that hydrogenation ability can be regulated by the combination of Zn with Ga or Al. The coordinatively unsaturated metal sites over ZnAl2Ox and ZnGa2Ox originating from oxygen vacancies (OVs) are evidenced to be responsible for the dissociative adsorption and activation of CO2. The evolution of the reaction intermediates, including both carbonaceous and hydrogen species at high temperatures and pressures over the spinel oxides, has been experimentally elaborated at the atomic level. With the integration of a series of zeolites or zeotypes, high selectivities of hydrocarbon chemicals with narrow distributions can be directly produced from CO2 and H2, offering a promising route for CO2 utilization.

The progressive transfer of photogenerated electrons between the catalyst components and reactants is of great significance for photocatalysis. Amorphous Pd (PdA) and oxygen vacancies (VOs) were simultaneously introduced in Pd-In2O3 exploiting hydrogen-induced amorphization effects; 0.6 wt% Pd-In2O3 exhibited a 4.5-fold increase in activity and a 3.2-fold higher selectivity toward CH3OH + CO (63.62 %) compared with In2O3. Multiple in situ techniques and theoretical calculations revealed that intercomponent electron transfer channels were established via various interface structures formed between PdA or crystalline Pd (PdC) and In2O3; PdA acted as electronic pump, facilitating the transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons, resulting in their subsequent enrichment on the surface of PdA. Simultaneously, PdA acted as electron-donating adsorption site for H2O, increasing the number of electrons received by H2O, further inhibiting the competitive adsorption of H2O and CO2 on VO sites, and promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, the electronic coupling between PdC and VOs could significantly decrease the electron-donating ability of VOs, reducing the number of electrons received by CO2, thus effectively regulating the degree of CO2 reduction. This study employs PdA/PdC and VOs to synergistic optimize the progressive transfer of photogenerated electrons, and presents a novel approach for elucidating the catalytic mechanism.

Advances in material fabrication techniques and growth methods have opened up a new chapter for twistronics, in the form of twisted freestanding three-dimensional material membranes. Through first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we investigate the crystal and electronic structures of twisted bilayer BaTiO$_3$. Our findings reveal that large stacking fault energy leads to chiral in-plane vortex pattern that was recently observed in experiments. Moreover, we also found non-zero out-of-plane local dipole moments, indicating that the strong interlayer interaction might offer promising strategy to stabilize ferroelectric order in the two-dimensional limit. Remarkably, the vortex pattern in the twisted BaTiO$_3$ bilayer support localized electronic states with quasi-flat bands, associated with the interlayer hybridization of oxygen $p_z$ orbitals. We found that the associated band width reaches a minimum at $\sim$19$^{\circ}$ twisting, configuring the largest magic angle in moir\'e systems reported so far. Further, the moir\'e vortex pattern bears a striking resemblance to two interpenetrating Lieb lattices and corresponding tight-binding model provides a comprehensive description of the evolution the moir\'e bands with twist angle and reveals the topological nature of these states.

Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4-2.4 $\mu$m with Gemini-S/IGRINS. We detected the presence of H$_{2}$O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise rations of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of $\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.70^{+1.27}_{-0.93}$, consistent with the stellar value, and a super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O$=0.80^{+0.07}_{-0.11}$. We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within $1\sigma$ but favored a slightly more sub-stellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio ($\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.74^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and C/O$=0.59^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ($V_{sys}$) and Keplerian ($K_{p}$) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted $V_{sys}$ for H$_{2}$O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H$_{2}$O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.

Arsenic, ubiquitous in various industrial processes and consumer products, presents both essential functions and considerable toxicity risks, driving extensive research into safer applications. Our investigation, drawing from 7,182 arsenic-containing molecules in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), outlines their diverse bonding patterns. Notably, 51% of these molecules exhibit cyclic connections, while 49% display acyclic ones. Arsenic forms eight distinct bonding types with other elements, with significant interactions observed, particularly with phenyl rings. Top interactions involve carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sulfur, and arsenic itself. We meticulously evaluated average bond lengths under three conditions: without an R-factor cut-off, with R-factor ≤ 0.075, and with R-factor ≤ 0.05, supporting the credibility of our results. Comparative analysis with existing literature data enriches our understanding of arsenic's bonding behaviour. Our findings illuminate the structural attributes, molecular coordination, geometry, and bond lengths of arsenic with diverse atoms, enriching our comprehension of arsenic chemistry. These revelations not only offer a pathway for crafting innovative and safer arsenic-based compounds but also foster the evolution of arsenic detoxification mechanisms, tackling pivotal health and environmental challenges linked to arsenic exposure across different contexts.

The molecules of 3,8-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (L1), 3,8-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (L2), 3,8-di(naphthalen-2-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (L3), 3,8-di(anthracen-9-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (L4) and 3,8-di(pyren-1-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (L5) were prepared in good yield from the reaction of 3,8-dibromo-1,10-phenanthroline and the corresponding boronic acid catalyzed by [Pd(PPh3)4]. Computational DFT modelling suggest than the aromatic substituent arms are not coplanar with the central phenanthroline core, and that the HOMO-LUMO gap diminishes as the number of fused carbon rings in the arms increased. Cyclic voltammograms for the ligands show between one and two oxidation and one to three reduction waves, which are believed to be centered on the arms and the central phen fragments respectively, suggesting some small electronic mixing. The absorption and emission properties depend on the electronic interaction between the polyaromatic substituents and the phenanthroline core. Different emissive ππ* excited states for the molecules bearing anthryl and pyrenyl substituents conferring them a more charge transfer character, and a consequent major sensitive to the increase of solvent polarity. The photosensitizing capacity of singlet oxygen generation upon excitation of L1-L5 in solution is consistent with a significant evolution of the former singlet excited state towards a triplet excited state.

Mixing length scales for methane–oxygen shear-coaxial single-element rocket injectors were experimentally assessed using laser absorption tomography. The laser spectroscopy technique enables quantitative and spatially resolved measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and temperature within the near-field region, probing rovibrational absorption lines of CO near [Formula: see text]. Multiple injector designs were examined with differing oxidizer post recess depths to compare mixing characteristics. All tests were performed at an oxidizer-to-fuel ratio of 3 with a total propellant flow rate of 0.350 g/s. Planar measurements were taken at 16 axial positions, which collectively captured the first 57 mm of each flame. A tomographic inversion method was applied to obtain radially resolved distributions of temperature and CO mole fraction for each axial position, from which two-dimensional images of the thermochemical structure were generated. Characteristic mixing parameters are defined and extracted from features within the species and temperature profiles to visualize the spatial evolution of CO production. Increasing oxidizer post recess improved mixing due to enhanced shear-induced turbulence and associated radial diffusion of species and temperature; however, the enhancement was nonlinear. This work establishes the first use of laser absorption tomography to directly measure mixing length scales associated with temperature and species profiles in coaxial flames.

Abstract Lespedeza potaninii, a xerophytic subshrub belonging to the legume family, is native to the Tengger Desert and is highly adapted to drought. It has important ecological value due to its drought adaptability, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report a 1.24 Gb chromosome-scale assembly of the L. potaninii genome (contig N50=15.75 Mb). Our results indicate that L. potaninii underwent an allopolyploid event with two subgenomes, A and B, presenting asymmetric evolution and B subgenome dominance. We estimate that the two diploid progenitors of L. potaninii diverged around 3.6 MYA and merged around 1.0 MYA. We revealed that the expansion of hub genes associated with drought responses, such as the binding partner 1 of accelerated cell death 11 (ACD11) (BPA1), facilitated environmental adaptations of L. potaninii to desert habitats. We found a novel function of the BPA1 family in abiotic stress tolerance in addition to the known role in regulating the plant immune response, which could improve drought tolerance by positively regulating reactive oxygen species homeostasis in plants. We revealed that bZIP transcription factors could bind to the BPA1 promoter and activate its transcription. Our work fills the genomic data gap in the Lespedeza genus and the tribe Desmodieae, which should provide both theoretical support in the study of drought tolerance and in the molecular breeding of legume crops.

Abstract A 65–year–old male with renal cell carcinoma, previously treated with nephrectomy and recently diagnosed with lung metastases, presented to the cardiology clinic for investigations before starting chemotherapy. He reported a history of ischemic heart disease, a non–ST–elevation myocardial infarction for which he refused coronary angiography in 2005, and a negative maximal stress test for ischemia in 2017. Additionally, the patient reported insulin–dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and well–controlled arterial hypertension. The patient was referred for a cardiological evaluation due to a reported short–term rhythmic heartbeat without other cardiological symptoms. Cardiological parameters were stable (blood pressure: 140/95 mmHg; heart rate: 42 bpm, and oxygen saturation without oxygen supplementation: 98%). Physical examination was normal. Laboratory investigations did not show elevated levels of high–sensitivity troponin I, and only signs of mild chronic kidney disease were observed. The initial ECG showed sinus bradycardia with deeply inverted T–waves in the extended anterior area (Fig. 1), which were not present in an ECG performed one month earlier. There was no reported chest pain. An echocardiogram examination demonstrated hypertensive heart disease with marked hypokinesia of the mid–apical portion of the anterior wall and anterior interventricular septum, together with a moderate reduction in global systolic function (LV ejection fraction: 40%). The patient was hospitalized, and underwent coronary angiography the following day. He had a low–risk score (GRACE: 95 pts) As shown in Fig. 2, there was evidence of long sub–occlusive stenosis of the proximal part of the anterior descending coronary artery that was treated with angioplasty and a single drug–eluted stent placement, resulting in a good angiographic result. After the procedure, there was a rapid recovery of regional kinetics but a slower normalization of the electrocardiographic morphology (Fig. 3). Comment Wellens‘ syndrome identifies a particular subtype of unstable angina characterized by the appearance of ischemic changes on the ECG,. The clinical risk assessment of this subgroup of patients with ACS, apparently having a more benign prognosis due to their definition as unstable angina with a low GRACE risk score, potentially has an evolution toward a large myocardial infarction if not promptly diagnosed.

Abstract. A tipping point is defined by the IPCC as a critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly. Tipping points can be crossed solely by internal variation in the system or by approaching a bifurcation point where the current state loses stability and forces the system to move to another stable state. It is currently debated whether or not Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, abrupt warmings occurring during the last glacial period, are noise-induced or caused by the system reaching a bifurcation point. It can be shown that before a bifurcation point is reached there are observable changes in the statistical properties of the state variable. These are known as early warning signals and include increased fluctuation and correlation time. To express this behaviour we propose a new model based on the well-known first order autoregressive process (AR), with modifications to the correlation parameter such that it depends linearly on time. In order to estimate the time evolution of the correlation parameter we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework, from which Bayesian analysis can be performed using the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. We then apply the model to segments of the oxygen isotope ratios from the Northern Greenland Ice Core Project record corresponding to 17 DO events. Early warning signals were detected and found statistically significant for a number of DO events, suggesting that such events could indeed be caused by approaching a bifurcation point. The methodology developed to perform the given early warning analyses can be applied more generally, and is publicly available as the R-package INLA.ews.

This study investigated the effects of varied loadings of TiO2 overlayers in heterojunction with conventional Ir0.7Ta0.3Ox (IrTaOx) anodes on chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) and real (waste)water treatment at circum-neutral pH. With an optimized design of IrTaOx/TiO2, elevated ClER selectivity was attained by more facile chemisorption of chloride ions to a thin TiO2 layer on IrTaOx. The current efficiency (CE) of ClER in galvanostatic electrolysis of 50 mM NaCl solutions (at 30 mA cm–2) was maximized to ∼80% by a heterojunction architecture with ∼605 μg cm–2 of IrTaOx and ∼265 μg cm–2 of TiO2 after specific rounds of drop casting. Further increases in loading resulted in escalated film-pore resistance or deterioration of ClER selectivity. The observed CE values were correlated with experimental descriptors, such as potential of zero charge and flat band potential, demonstrating that the weaker metal–oxygen bond strength on TiO2 could enhance the ClER selectivity compared to bare IrTaOx. We concluded that ClER primarily occurs on TiO2 near the junction owing to the nanoporous nature of the TiO2 layer, while IrTaOx serves as ohmic contact. The optimized IrTaOx/TiO2 anodes effectively improved the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate, but phosphate ions in livestock wastewater caused adverse effects due to complexation on TiO2. The heterojunction architecture effectively tunes the surface charge density for selective generation of oxidants, which can facilitate electrochemical water treatment with reduced use of the precious metals.

Cyanobacteria oxygenated the atmosphere of early Earth and continue to be key players in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. A phylogenetically diverse subset of extant cyanobacteria can perform photosynthesis with far-red light through a process called far-red light photoacclimation, or FaRLiP. This phenotype is enabled by a cluster of ~20 genes, and involves the synthesis of red-shifted chlorophylls f and d, together with paralogues of the ubiquitous photosynthetic machinery used in visible light. The FaRLiP gene cluster is present in diverse, environmentally important cyanobacterial groups but its origin, evolutionary history, and connection to early biotic environments have remained unclear. This study takes advantage of the recent increase in (meta)genomic data to clarify this issue; sequence data mining, metagenomic assembly, and phylogenetic tree networks were used to recover more than 600 new FaRLiP gene sequences, corresponding to 52 new gene clusters. These data enable high-resolution phylogenetics and - by relying on multiple gene trees, together with gene arrangement conservation - support FaRLiP appearing early in cyanobacterial evolution. Sampling information shows that considerable FaRLiP diversity can be observed in microbialites to the present day, and the process may have been associated with microbial mats and stromatolite formation in the early Paleoproterozoic. The ancestral FaRLiP cluster was reconstructed, revealing a conserved intergenic regulatory sequence that has been maintained for billions of years. Taken together, our results indicate that oxygenic photosynthesis using far-red light may have played a significant role in Earth's early history.

The work investigates the deposition of zinc and oxygen atoms on a Zinc terminated ZnO substrate, maintaining their stoichiometric ratio (O:Zn) at 0.8, under varying incident energies (0.5 eV and 5 eV) and temperatures (300 K and 700 K) using the ReaxFF potential in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. The study explores the impact of deposition conditions on growth mechanisms, film morphology, and structural parameters such as Radial Distribution Function (RDF) and Coordination Number (CN). RDF analysis highlights disordered atomic arrangements and diverse bonding configurations within the film, with CN showing deviations from perfect crystalline ZnO, indicating non-uniform, non-crystalline, and nano behaviour. Post-heating the films to temperatures approaching the ZnO melting point results in enhanced crystallinity, as evidenced by distinct, dominant, and multiple RDF peaks. Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach of the deposited structures elucidates the formation of ZnO nanoclusters-(ZnO)3 and (ZnO)4 and investigates their electronic structure properties. DFT analysis of the post-heated films reveals the formation of ZnO monomers (ZnO), indicating an approaching crystalline behaviour, yet the films exhibit non-epitaxial and non-uniform characteristics. DFT calculations were instrumental in validating the observed structural behaviours in the deposited films. The study underscores the significance of stoichiometric ratio in film deposition and demonstrates the temperature-dependent evolution of structural properties towards crystallinity, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of ZnO film growth offering tailored control over film properties for enhanced performance in practical applications such as optoelectronics and gas sensing.

Studies have determined that nonredox enzymes that are cofactored with Fe(II) are the most oxidant-sensitive targets inside Escherichia coli . These enzymes use Fe(II) cofactors to bind and activate substrates. Because of their solvent exposure, the metal can be accessed and oxidized by reactive oxygen species, thereby inactivating the enzyme. Because these enzymes participate in key physiological processes, the consequences of stress can be severe. Accordingly, when E. coli senses elevated levels of H 2 O 2 , it induces both a miniferritin and a manganese importer, enabling the replacement of the iron atom in these enzymes with manganese. Manganese does not react with H 2 O 2 and thereby preserves enzyme activity. In this study, we examined several diverse microbes to identify the metal that they customarily integrate into ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase, a representative of this enzyme family. The anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , like E. coli , uses iron. In contrast, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis use manganese, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae uses zinc. The latter organisms are therefore well suited to the oxidizing environments in which they dwell. Similar results were obtained with peptide deformylase, another essential enzyme of the mononuclear class. Strikingly, heterologous expression experiments show that it is the metal pool within the organism, rather than features of the protein itself, that determine which metal is incorporated. Further, regardless of the source organism, each enzyme exhibits highest turnover with iron and lowest turnover with zinc. We infer that the intrinsic catalytic properties of the metal cannot easily be retuned by evolution of the polypeptide.

Abstract This study explores the low‐temperature pyrolysis kinetic of low metamorphic grade coal from Northern Shaanxi, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy to analyze the characteristics of various functional groups over a 293–1023 K temperature range. A kinetic model, correlating with the pyrolysis behaviors of these groups, was developed through thermal analysis kinetics. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology simulated the furnace's flow dynamics, allowing an examination of the physical field alterations and functional group evolution during pyrolysis. Results showed that the pyrolysis kinetic functions for aromatic C–H, C=C, C–O, and •OH, along with temperature, pressure, and velocity fields, were successfully integrated into the simulation. This integration provided detailed insights into the temperature profile, pressure distribution, flow velocities, and functional group distribution in the furnace. Aliphatics, exhibiting the largest mass fraction and wide pyrolysis temperature range, and •OH radicals with the highest activation energy were concentrated in the furnace's pyrolysis zone center. C=C's distribution was influenced by aromatic C–H and aliphatics, showing a complementary pattern. The oxygen‐containing groups C–O and C=O had similar pyrolysis mechanisms and uniform distribution. The functional groups' mass fractions were ranked from highest to lowest as follows: aliphatics > •OH > aromatic C–H > C–O > C=C > C=O.

The observation of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) associated with a supernova (SN) coincides remarkably with the energy output from a binary system comprising a very massive carbon-oxygen (CO) core and an associated binary neutron star (NS) by the Binary-Driven Hypernova (BdHN) model. The dragging effect in the late evolution of such systems leads to co-rotation, with binary periods on the order of minutes, resulting in a very fast rotating core and a binary NS companion at a distance of $\sim 10^5$ km. Such a fast-rotating CO core, stripped of its hydrogen and helium, undergoes gravitational collapse and, within a fraction of seconds, leads to a supernova (SN) and a newly born, fast-spinning neutron star ($\nu$NS), we name the emergence of the SN and the $\nu$NS as the SN-rise and $\nu$NS-rise. Typically, the SN energies range from $10^{51}$ to $10^{53}$ erg. We address this issue by examining 10 cases of Type-I BdHNe, the most energetic ones, in which SN accretion onto the companion NS leads to the formation of a black hole (BH). In all ten cases, the energetics of the SN events are estimated, ranging between $0.18$ and $12 \times 10^{52}$ erg. Additionally, in all 8 sources at redshift $z$ closer than $4.61$, a clear thermal blackbody component has been identified, with temperatures between $6.2$ and $39.99$ keV, as a possible signature of pair-driven SN. The triggering of the X-ray afterglow induced by the $\nu$NS-rise are identified in three cases at high redshift where early X-ray observations are achievable, benefits from the interplay of cosmological effects.

A magma ocean (MO) is thought to be a ubiquitous stage in the early evolution of rocky planets and exoplanets. During the lifetime of the MO, exchanges between the interior and exterior envelopes of the planet are very efficient. In particular, volatile elements that initially are contained in the solid part of the planet can be released and form a secondary outgassed atmosphere. We determine trends in the H-C-N-O-S composition and thickness of these secondary atmospheres for varying planetary sizes and MO extents, and the oxygen fugacity of MOs, which provides the main control for the atmospheric chemistry. We used a model with coupled chemical gas-gas and silicate melt-gas equilibria and mass conservation to predict the composition of an atmosphere at equilibrium with the MO depending on the planet size and the extent and redox state of the MO. We used a self-consistent mass-radius model for the rocky core to inform the structure of the planet, which we combined with an atmosphere model to predict the transit radius of lava worlds. We find that MOs (especially the shallow ones) on small planets are generally more reduced, and are thus dominated by H2-rich atmospheres (whose outgassing is strengthened at low planetary mass), while larger planets and deeper MOs vary from CO to CO2-N2-SO2 atmospheres, with increasing fO2 . In the former case, the low molecular mass of the atmosphere combined with the low gravity of the planets yields a large vertical extension of the atmosphere, while in the latter cases, secondary outgassed atmospheres on super-Earths are likely significantly shrunk. Both N and C are largely outgassed regardless of the conditions, while the S and H outgassing is strongly dependent on the fO2 , as well as on the planetary mass and MO extent for the latter.

We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of $\sim$20 au that straddles the L/T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 $\pm$ 3 km/s and water plus carbon monoxide mass fractions of log CO = $-$2.3 $\pm$ 0.3 and log H$_2$O = $-$2.7 $\pm$ 0.2. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 $\pm$ 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L/T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high $v\sin{i}$ and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures we are sensitive to. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation over break-up velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of >200 very low-mass objects (M$\lesssim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated field low-mass objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.

Abstract We use the extensive stellar occultation data set of the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph aboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft to determine the first quantification of vertical variation in O 2 mole fraction separately for day and night in the ∼90–130 km altitude range. The upper atmospheric O 2 variation is expected to be due to the interplay between diffusion and advection because of its long photochemical lifetime. It is therefore a useful tracer of the state of atmospheric mixing and circulation. The altitude‐averaged mixing ratio is measured to be 2.69(±0.03) × 10 −3 for the nightside and 2.05(±0.03) × 10 −3 for the dayside. The average O 2 mole fraction for day and night are nearly identical below 105 km, consistent with the value of 1.61 × 10 −3 derived from the Mars Curiosity Rover/Sample Analysis at Mars near‐surface measurements. At higher altitudes, dominated by molecular diffusive separation, the measured O 2 mole fraction demonstrates a vertical gradient with a local time dependence. The nightside mole fraction is a factor of 1.37 ± 0.04 larger than the dayside value at ∼125 km. This nightside enhancement is explained in terms of the relative role of solar‐driven rapid horizontal winds at high altitudes and slower vertical diffusion, resulting in a nightside (dayside) downward (upward) diffusive flux. Using the 1‐D diffusion model, the measured profiles correspond to a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient K = 3.5(±1.5) × 10 6 cm 2 / s . The Mars Climate Database predicts comparable but lower day‐night differences in oxygen mole fraction due to an overestimated K = 7.0(±1.0) × 10 6 cm 2 / s , which affects atmospheric mixing as well as the rate of atmospheric escape to space.

Abstract Male, 79 years old, presented to the ED with chest pain and hemodynamically instability. Approximately one month prior, he underwent aortic bioprosthesis implantation for severe aortic stenosis. Pre–intervention coronary angiography revealed diffuse atheromatous plaques, none of which were stenotic. Additionally, the patient‘s medical history included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on NOAC, hypertension and COPD. Upon admission: NIBP 80/50 mmHg, HR 150 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 85%. ECG showed atrial fibrillation with ST–segment elevation from V1 to V5. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.25 and lactate 6 mmol/L. He received inotropic and vasopressor support, and prompt coronary angiography was performed, revealing 99% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery at the bifurcation with the diagonal branch, which was treated with angioplasty and coronary stent placement (Fig.1). Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated the presence of the aortic bioprosthesis with diffusely thickened leaflets consistent with multiple vegetations. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed a nosocomial infectious endocarditis, with mild–to–moderate stenosis, and evidence of peri–prosthetic echogenic material directed towards the left atrium, suggestive of abscess. The patient reported low–grade fever and asthenia in the weeks prior. The systemic and local inflammatory state of the endocarditis contributed to an accelerated atherosclerotic process, destabilizing the plaque and resulting in its rupture. Blood cultures identified multidrug–resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus, for which specific antibiotic therapy was started. The patient and his family declined cardiac surgery due to high operative risk. Follow–up TEE, after approximately six weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy, showed reduced vegetations on the bioprosthetic valve leaflets, with evolution of the previously noted large echolucent cavity, along with two similar peri–prosthetic lesions. These findings were confirmed on contrast–enhanced CT. The patient, achieving hemodynamic stability, was discharged home, continuing intravenous antibiotic therapy (OPAT protocol). At the one–month post–discharge follow–up, the patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. A repeat TEE showed normally mobile bioprosthetic valve leaflets without vegetations, and the previously noted large cavity with internal flow, consistent with cleansed abscess (Fig.2–3).

Here, we use ecological modeling and computational flow simulations to explore how Ediacaran marine animal forests influenced their surrounding environment. Our results reveal how organism morphology and community structure and composition combined to impact vertical mixing of the surrounding water. We find that Mistaken Point communities were capable of generating high-mixing conditions, thereby likely promoting gas and nutrient transport within the "canopy." This mixing could have served to enhance local-scale oxygen concentrations and redistribute resources like dissolved organic carbon. Our work suggests that Ediacaran marine animal forests may have contributed to the ventilation of the oceans over 560 million years ago, well before the Cambrian explosion of animals.
