Abstract Alkaline zinc‐iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are well suited for energy storage because of their good safety, high cell voltage, and low cost. However, the occurrence of irreversible anodic parasitic reactions results in a diminished coulombic efficiency (CE), unbalanced charge state of catholyte/anolyte and subsequently, a poor cycling performance. Here, we report a universal CE compensation strategy centered around the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodic side. This strategy aims to equalize the charge state of the [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3‐/4− ‐based catholyte and counteract pH fluctuations. The OER process can be implemented either directly on the electrode through electrochemical reaction or in an external catalytic reactor column via a redox‐mediated process. This innovative approach effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3− in discharged catholyte and [Zn(OH) 4 ] 2− in charged anolyte by consuming the extra OH − during continuous cycling process. As a result, AZIFBs demonstrated exceptional cycling performance with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0128%/day (or 0.0005%/cycle) over 600 cycles at 80% state of charge (SOC). The proposed CE compensation strategy not only provides an effective way to address the CE loss issue for AZIFBs but can also be applied to diverse battery technologies encountering CE loss caused by water/oxygen‐induced parasitic reactions.

Herein, a self‐supported, robust, and noble‐metal‐free 3D hierarchical interface‐rich Fe‐doped Co‐LDH@MoS2‐Ni3S2/NF heterostructure electrocatalyst has been prepared through a controllable two‐step hydrothermal process. The resultant electrode shows low overpotential of ⁓95 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ⁓220 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the two‐electrode system requires only a cell voltage of ⁓1.54 V at 10 mA cm−2 current density, respectively. Extensive ab initio calculations were carried out to find out the overpotential for HER, orbital interaction through the determination of electron density of states and quantification of charge transfer by Bader charge analysis. The computed overpotential matched closely with the experimental data. The superior HER performance of the tri‐layer is enhanced due to the charge transfer (1.7444e) to Fe‐doped Co‐LDH from Ni3S2‐MoS2 hybrid. This research strategy paves an effective pathway for affordable green H2 production and future efficient non‐precious bifunctional electrocatalyst design for overall water electrolysis.

Abstract The potential of electrochemical water splitting to tackle energy and environmental issues has garnered substantial interest. In the present work, an effective ZnS/In 2 Te 3 has been constructed by hydrothermal support on a stainless‐steel strip and explored for oxygen evolution. The addition of ZnS modifies the band structure of In 2 Te 3 and enhances its specific conductivity and capacitance on an intrinsic level, making rapid ion transportation. The optimized ZnS/In 2 Te 3 displayed efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 228 mV and a Tafel slope of 111 mV dec −1 with cyclic activity up to 1000 cycles in 1 M KOH solution. ZnS/In 2 Te 3 has a large surface area (28 m 3 g −1 ) and a charge capacitance of (.037 mF), according to studies using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and double‐layer capacitance. Combining several strategies improves overall electrochemical performance of ZnS/In 2 Te 3 , making it a promising option for use in state‐of‐the‐art OER.

A series of monometallic Ni‐, Co‐ and Zn‐MOFs and bimetallic NiCo‐, NiZn‐ and CoZn‐MOFs M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M’)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, with the same pillar and layer linkers 4‐diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene‐1,4‐dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave‐assisted thermal conversion synthesis method within only 12 min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M’ was 4:1. The mono‐ and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic‐activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301 mV and Tafel slopes of 42 mV dec−1 on a glassy carbon electrode in 1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, NiCoMOF was in situ grown in just 25 min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) where overpotentials of 313 and 328 mV at current densities of 50 and 300 mA cm–2, respectively, were delivered and superior long‐term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27 mV dec−1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement (Rfar = 2 Ω), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite.

The advancement of water electrolyzer technologies and the production of sustainable hydrogen fuel heavily rely on the development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High entropy ceramics, characterized by their unique properties, such as lattice distortion and high configurational entropy, hold significant promise for catalytic applications. In this study, we utilized the sol–gel autocombustion method to synthesize high entropy ceramics containing a combination of 3d transition metals and aluminum ((AlCrCoNiFe2)O). We then compared their electrocatalytic performance with other series of synthesized multimetal and monometallic oxides for the OER under alkaline conditions. Our electrochemical analysis revealed that the high entropy ceramics exhibited excellent performance and the lowest charge transfer resistance, Tafel slope (29 mV·dec–1), and overpotential (η10 = 230 mV). These remarkable results can be primarily attributed to the high entropy effect induced by the addition of Al, Cr, Co, Ni, and Fe, which introduces increased disorder and complexity into the material's structure. This, in turn, facilitates more efficient OER catalysis by providing diverse active sites and promoting optimal electronic configurations for the reaction. Furthermore, the strong electronic interactions among the constituent elements in the metallic spinels further enhance their catalytic activity in the initiation of the OER process. Combined with the reduced charge transfer resistance, these factors collectively play pivotal roles in enhancing the OER performance of the electrocatalysts. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the design and development of high-performance electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications. By harnessing the high entropy effect and leveraging strong electronic interactions, electrocatalytic materials can be tailored to improve efficiency and stability, thus advancing the progress of clean energy technologies.

Developing highly active electrocatalysts is crucial for the application of electrocatalytic water splitting. In this study, we prepared vanadium oxide–graphene carbon nanocomposites (VxOy/C) with abundant defects using a carbon- and oxygen-rich hexavanadate derivative Na2[V6O7{(OCH2)3CCH3}4] as a precursor without the addition of an extra carbon source. Subsequently, the VxOy/C was used as a catalyst support to load a small amount of Ir, forming the Ir/VxOy/C nanoelectrocatalyst. This catalyst exhibited low hydrogen evolution overpotentials of only 18.90 and 13.46 mV at a working current density of 10 mA cm–2 in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte systems, outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalysts. Additionally, the catalyst showed excellent chemical stability and long-term durability. This work provides a new strategy for the design and synthesis of highly active electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Despite the widespread investigations on the M‐N‐C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure‐property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well‐designed pH‐dependent metal leaching experiments and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M‐N‐C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni‐N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni‐O coordination. The formed Ni‐O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.

Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with other less energy-intense oxidizing reactions is an attractive option to reduce the energy demand for hydrogen production in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer using transition metals and their alloys. Since urea is commonly available as a waste product, pairing the urea oxidation at the anode with hydrogen evolution at the cathode in alkaline electrolysis can alleviate environmental issues while simultaneously producing hydrogen. In this respect, we prepared nickel–copper films on nickel felt substrate as a urea oxidation catalyst, which exhibited a lower Tafel slope compared to oxygen evolution, indicating a more favorable reaction pathway. Confirming the improvement, in an AEM electrolyzer, a current density of 50 mA cm–2 required a cell voltage of 1.60 V for urea coupled hydrogen production compared to 1.83 V for water oxidation. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide were identified using mass spectrometry (MS) as the main gaseous products during urea electrolysis. A relatively stable zero-gap AEM urea electrolyzer operation at room temperature for over 120 h and at 323.15 K under intermittent power conditions, using nickel–copper catalyst as anode and nickel–molybdenum catalyst as cathode, was demonstrated. Finally, an efficient hydrogen production in the zero-gap alkaline urea electrolyzer at a lower voltage than for water electrolysis was proven using online MS analysis. These results validate the feasibility of reducing the specific energy consumption of electrolyzers used for low-carbon hydrogen production with renewable energy sources.

Antiferroelectric (AFE) ZrO2-based devices are anticipated to exhibit superior endurance properties in comparison to their ferroelectric (FE) counterparts. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of AFE devices remain elusive. In this study, guided by the dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies (Vo), we reveal three kinds of fatigue in AFE HfxZr1−xO2 (HZO) during uni-directional cycling. The first mechanism is related to the interfacial Vo charge trapping, which accelerates the switching from the P↓↑ state to the P↓↓ state, leading to extrinsic fatigue, and is demonstrated by electrical stress measurements. The other two mechanisms are Vo-related AFE to FE phase transition (PT) and Vo localization inside the HZO films, which are supported by the first-principles calculations. The highest polarization switching barrier occurs when Vo is localized at the tetra-coordinated oxygen sites inside HZO films. This means that tetra-coordinated Vo accumulation leads to less polarization switching, resulting in AFE to FE PT and Vo localization induced fatigue, i.e., intrinsic fatigue. This work reveals the dynamic evolution of Vo during cycling and its impact on AFE properties, paving the way for developing more durable AFE ZrO2-based devices and contributing to the emergence of diverse recovery methods in the future.

Seawater seems to be a sustainable feed for hydrogen generation through electrolysis. Despite the thermodynamic propensity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode during seawater electrolysis, the kinetically fast and unfavorable chlorine oxidation reaction (COR) dominates. Thus, designing active and selective anodes for seawater electrolysis is challenging. Here, we are investigating the effect of MnO2 polymorphic structures as an anode material for simulated seawater electrolysis in a basic medium. Contrary to the belief that MnO2 is an OER catalyst, we discovered that only α- and β-MnO2 are preferentially OER catalysts, whereas γ- and δ-MnO2 are selective for COR. The experimental findings imply that discrete translational symmetry in distinct polymorphs promotes different reaction intermediates, disrupting the scaling relation between the OER and COR. We also studied the polymorphic impact of MnO2 on limiting Cl– ion transport over a conventional catalyst of IrO2 in an alkaline medium to scale up seawater electrolysis. The research found that γ-MnO2 is the most likely to impede the COR active sites over IrO2 among the four polymorphs studied (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-MnO2). We identified that γ-MnO2 functions as a Lewis acid layer, thereby augmenting the kinetics of the OER across the IrO2 surface and establishing a barrier against Cl– ions.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising technology to produce hydrogen directly from renewable electricity sources due to its high power density and potential for dynamic operation. Widespread application of PEMWE is, however, currently limited due to high cost and low efficiency, for which high loading of expensive iridium catalyst and high OER overpotential, respectively, are important reasons. In this study, we synthesize highly dispersed IrRu nanoparticles (NPs) supported on antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) to maximize catalyst utilization. Furthermore, we study the effect of adding various amounts of Ni to the synthesis, both in terms of catalyst structure and OER activity. Through characterization using various X-ray techniques, we determine that the presence of Ni during synthesis yields significant changes in the structure of the IrRu NPs. With no Ni present, metallic IrRu NPs were synthesized with Ir-like structure, while the presence of Ni leads to the formation of IrRu oxide particles with rutile/hollandite structure. There are also clear indications that the presence of Ni yields smaller particles, which can result in better catalyst dispersion. The effect of these differences on OER activity was also studied through rotating disc electrode measurements. The IrRu-supported catalyst synthesized with Ni exhibited OER activity of up to 360 mA mgPGM–1 at 1.5 V vs RHE. This is ∼7 times higher OER activity than the best-performing IrOx benchmark reported in the literature and more than twice the activity of IrRu-supported catalyst synthesized without Ni. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to further elucidate the origin of the observed activity enhancement, showing no improvement in intrinsic OER activity for hollandite Ir and Ru compared to the rutile structures. We, therefore, hypothesize that the increased activity measured for the IrRu supported catalyst synthesized with Ni present is instead due to increased electrochemical surface area.

Water electrolysis is considered a compelling path for generating ecofriendly and sustainable hydrogen fuel. To realize highly effective electrocatalytic water splitting, improving anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is key because of its high overpotential. The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising method instead of the OER. Herein, a series of bimetallic nanoporous M2V-MOF materials (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) with vanadium doping is successfully synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method and the materials are applied as electrocatalysts for water and urea electrolysis. Among the as-synthesized M2V-MOF materials, Fe2V-MOF as an impressive trifunctional electrocatalyst has very low overpotentials of 291 mV@10 mA cm–2 for the OER, 1.48 V@50 mA cm–2 for the UOR, and 182 mV@–10 mA cm–2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Adapting it as a cathode and anode electrode for water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, a low cell voltage of 1.73 V is required for delivering 10 mA cm–2. The urea-assisted electrolysis cell only needs 1.63 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and exhibits excellent stability over 60 h.

Although Ru‐based materials are among the outstanding catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the instability issue still haunts them and impedes the widespread application. The instability of Ru‐based OER catalysts is generally ascribed to the formation of soluble species through the over‐oxidation of Ru and structural decomposition caused by involvement of lattice oxygen. Herein, an effective strategy of selectively activating the lattice oxygen around Ru site is proposed to improve the OER activity and stability. Our synthesized spinel‐type electrocatalyst of Ru and Zn co‐doped Co3O4 showed an ultralow overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and a long‐term stability reaching to 100 hours at 10 mA cm‐2 for alkaline OER. The experimental results and theoretical simulations demonstrated that the lattice oxygen site jointly connected with the octahedral Ru and tetrahedral Zn atoms became more active than other oxygen sites near Ru atom, which further lowered the reaction energy barriers and avoided generating excessive oxygen vacancies to enhance the structural stability of Ru sites. The findings hope to provide a new perspective to improve the catalytic activity of Ru‐incorporated OER catalysts and the stability of lattice‐oxygen‐mediated mechanism.

Designing bifunctional catalysts to reduce the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) reaction barriers while accelerating the reaction kinetics is perceived to be a promising strategy to improve the performance of Zinc-air batteries. Unsymmetric configuration in single-atom catalysts has attracted attention due to its unique advantages in regulating electron orbitals. In this work, a seesaw effect in unsymmetric Fe-Co bimetallic monoatomic configurations is proposed, which can effectively improve the OER/ORR bifunctional activity of the catalyst. Compared with the symmetrical model of Fe-Co, a strong charge polarization between Co and Fe atoms in the unsymmetric model is detected, in whom the spin-down electrons around Co atoms are much higher than those spin-up electrons. The seesaw effect occurred between Co atoms and Fe atoms, resulting in a negative shift of the d-band center, which means that the adsorption of oxygen intermediates is weakened and more conducive to their dissociation. The optimized reaction kinetics of the catalyst leads to excellent performance in ZABs, with a peak power density of 215 mW cm

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting offers an advancing approach to producing highly pure hydrogen and oxygen, motivated by the prevalence of a low‐carbon economy and the goal of a sustainable future. The customized modulation of electronic structures enables the electrocatalyst to directionally promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a promising shortcut to overall water splitting (OWS). Herein, 3D homologous WSeS/CoSeS heterojunction nanoarrays (WSeS/CoSeS NAs) and W‐doped CoSeS nanoarrays (W‐CoSeS NAs) are investigated. Abundant heterointerfaces within WSeS/CoSeS NAs facilitate HER kinetics, boosting mass diffusivity, and increasing carrier separation and transfer process. High‐valence W 6+ doping into CoSeS prevents phase separation and stabilizes Co sites by charge offset effect, leading to enhanced OER. Consequently, the WSeS/CoSeS NAs and W‐CoSeS NAs reach 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of 43.8 and 233.3 mV in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, when asymmetrically engaged as an electrolyzer, this configuration exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performances (cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm −2 ) with satisfying stability and mechanical robustness (over 1000 h at 1000 mA cm −2 ). The modulation and manufacture of reaction‐property‐oriented materials are experimentally and theoretically validated potential, illuminating the light of inspiration for multiple applications.

Abstract Although lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs) hold great promise as future energy storage systems, they are impeded by insulated discharge product Li 2 O 2 and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution revolution (ORR/OER) kinetics. The application of a highly efficient cathode catalyst determines the LOBs performance. The d‐band modulation and catalytic kinetics promotion are important concept guidelines for the performance enhancement of cathode catalysts. In this work, the homogeneous in‐plane distortion‐derived synergistic catalytic capability of an Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 catalyst with modulated d‐band centers and promoted ORR/OER kinetics is demontrated. The uniform elongation of Ag─O bonds and compression of Mo─O bonds in (020) plane leads to d‐band splitting and d‐band center optimization and delivers improved adsorption behavior for high ORR/OER capability. Furthermore, the spatial and energy overlap of Ag d xz and O 2 anti‐bonding π * orbitals facilitate electron injection during ORR process and reduce the energy barrier for charge transfer and O 2 desorption during OER process, accelerating the ORR/OER kinetics. As a result, the (020) plane‐exposed Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 cathode exhibits ultralong cycle stability of 817 cycles at 500 mA g −1 and large specific discharge/charge capacities of 15898/15180 mAh g −1 . This work provides facile concept guidance for optimizing catalytic capability through controlled lattice distortion in cathode catalysts for LOBs.

Flexible quasi-solid zinc–air batteries, known for their efficiency and promising potential as an energy storage system, have found extensive applications in the fields of portable power supply, wildlife rescue, and flexible wearable devices. Herein, a FeNx/ZnSe/Fe heterojunction nanocomposite anchored on leafy nitrogen-doped carbon (FeNx/ZnSe/Fe–NC) is developed as a highly active bifunctional catalyst via one-step high-temperature selenization of Fe-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks 8. The formation of the heterostructure FeNx/ZnSe/Fe is conducive to accelerating electron transfer and improving the activity of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, FeNx/ZnSe/Fe–NC exhibits exceptional performance in liquid Zn–air batteries, comparable to the potency of industrially produced catalysts fabricated from precious metals. Notably, the gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with a double-network structure, composed of poly(vinyl alcohol)- and polyacrylamide-modified with dimethyl sulfoxide (PVA–PAM–DMSO), exhibits significantly higher conductivity (193.5 mS cm–1) and excellent water retention (93.6%). As a result of the FeNx/ZnSe/Fe–NC catalyst and PVA–PAM–DMSO GPE, a flexible Zn–air battery with high-rate capability has been achieved, which demonstrates a high open-circuit potential of 1.51 V. This battery displays exceptional performance with excellent durability, adaptability, and adjustment capacity across a broad temperature range.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolutionc reaction (OER) are important chemical reactions for a rechargeable lithium–oxygen battery (LOB). Recently, high-entropy alloys and oxides have attracted much attention because they showed good electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and/or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we aimed to synthesize and characterize CoSn(OH)6 and two types of high-entropy perovskite hydroxides, that is, (Co0.2Cu0.2Fe0.2Mn0.2Mg0.2)Sn(OH)6 (CCFMMSOH) and (Co0.2Cu0.2Fe0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2)Sn(OH)6 (CCFMNSOH). TEM observation and XRD measurements revealed that the high-entropy hydroxides CCFMMSOH and CCFMNSOH had cubic crystals with sides of approximately 150–200 nm and crystal structures similar to those of perovskite-type CSOH. LSV measurement results showed that the high-entropy hydroxides CCFMMSOH and CCFMNSOH showed bifunctional catalytic functions for the ORR and OER. CCFMNSOH showed better catalytic performance than CCFMMSOH.

Abstract The energy transition and the implementation of new electrochemical technologies will result in an increased reliance on critical raw materials for electrodes. Their large‐scale application will ultimately mean working with lower grade materials. Here we study the influence of metal impurities on nickel foam electrocatalysts. We do this by electrodepositing known amounts of first‐row transition metals (Cu, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) on nickel foam and studying their performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model reaction. The electrodes’ performance is studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel analysis, stepwise chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Combining these results with microscopy analysis, we show that even small amounts of transition‐metal impurities have profound effects on the catalytic performance of nickel electrodes. The changes affect the OER onset potential (the energy that the system requires to convert OH – to O 2 ) and the Tafel slope of each electrode (the electrode's initial activity in the OER onset region). Our results highlight the implications of such impurities on electrode design and future large‐scale application.

Abstract In this manuscript, we explore the effect of pH on the selectivity of a hydrothermally synthesized nanostructured γ‐MnO 2 electrocatalyst in the alkaline environment. Selectivity of electrodeposited γ‐MnO 2 toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.5 M NaCl at pH 12 has been demonstrated by Fujimura et al (Mat. Sci. Eng., A267 (1999) 254–259). Herein, we extend the pH region from pH 8.2 to pH 13 and demonstrate by thin‐film rotating disk electrode (RDE) method that the catalyst is selective toward the OER at current densities up to ca 15 mA/cm 2 in the entire range of pH, if buffer is utilized to mitigate the effect of local pH. In synthetic seawater, at pH 8.2, the catalyst is not selective toward the OER. The analysis of the OER Tafel slopes at low current densities (<3 mA/cm 2 ) shows that the slopes were not affected by pH in 0.5 M NaCl solutions, which suggests the same OER mechanism. At the same time, reaction rate decreased with decrease in pH. Nafion ionomer in the catalyst layer may adversely affect the catalyst's performance at pH ≤12 by limiting diffusion of OH − ions through the Nafion film. Catalyst layers need to be carefully designed to avoid negative effects of Nafion.

The development of water electrolysis catalysts that accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial challenge. Ni-based oxides are promising OER catalysts; however, quantitative studies of Ni-based oxides remain unexplored. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the OER activity of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as a thin-film electrode catalyst. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin film fabricated using a sputtering method exhibited a current density of 6.6 and ∼2.6 mAcm−2 for geometric and estimated areas, respectively, at 1.78 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Ni3+ in the as-grown and post-OER LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin films. These results suggest that Ni3+ plays a key role in the OER of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4.

Abstract Alkali‐metal doped perovskite oxides have emerged as promising materials due to their unique properties and broad applications in various fields, including photovoltaics and catalysis. Understanding the complex interplay between alkali metal doping, structural modifications, and their impact on performance remains a crucial challenge. In this study, this challenge is addressed by investigating the synthesis and properties of Rb‐doped perovskite oxides. These results reveal that the doping of Rb into perovskite oxides function as a structural modifier in the as‐synthesized samples and during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well. Electron microscopy and first‐principles calculations confirm the enrichment of Rb on the surface of the as‐synthesized sample. Further investigations into the electrocatalytic reaction revealed that the Rb‐doped perovskite underwent drastic restructuring with Rb leaching and formation of strontium oxide.

Abstract Developing cost‐effective, durable bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial but remains challenging due to slow hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) kinetics in water electrolysis. Herein, a combined engineering strategy of phosphorous vacancy (V p ) and spontaneous built‐in electric field (BIEF) is proposed to design novel highly‐conductive Co‐doped MoP@MXene heterostructures with phosphorous vacancy (V p ‐Co‐MoP@MXene). Wherein, Co doping regulates the surface electronic structure and charge re‐distribution of MoP, V p induces more defects and active sites, while BIEF accelerates the interfacial charge transfer rate between V p ‐Co‐MoP and MXene. Therefore, the synergistic integration of V p ‐Co‐MoP/MXene efficiently decreases activation energy and kinetic barrier, thus promoting its intrinsically catalytic activity and structural stability. Consequently, the V p ‐Co‐MoP@MXene catalyst displays low overpotentials of 102.3/196.5 and 265.0/320.0 mV at 10/50 mA cm −2 for HER and OER, respectively. Notably, two‐electrode electrolyzers with the V p ‐Co‐MoP@MXene bifunctional catalysts to achieve 10/50 mA cm −2 , only need low‐cell voltages of 1.57/1.64 V in alkaline media. Besides, experimental and theoretical results confirm that the hetero‐structure effectively reduces hydrogen adsorption free energy and rate‐determining‐step energy barrier of OER intermediates, thereby greatly boosting its intrinsically catalytic activity. This work verifies an effective strategy to fabricate efficient non‐precious bifunctional electro‐catalysts for water splitting via combination engineering of phosphorous vacancy, cation doping, and BIEF.

Heterometal phosphates are burgeoning electrocatalysts and cathode materials in energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we demonstrate a novel and clean synthetic route for substoichiometric lithium-deficient metastable Cmcm-Li0.65(7)Co1.16(2)PO4 (Li-Co-P-HEX) and metaphosphate P212121-LiCo(PO3)3 (Li-Co-P-BT), starting from the same starting material [LiCo(dtbp)3] (dtbp = di-tert-butyl phosphate) through a thermolytic single-source precursor approach. The heterometal organophosphate [LiCo(dtbp)3] decomposed into different phases of inorganic heterometal phosphates by employing a solution and solid-state thermal treatment. The solution-processed Li-deficient orthophosphate exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction activity, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm–2 at an overpotential of 294 mV, outperforming other reported lithium–cobalt phosphates for water oxidation. The enhanced performance of the Cmcm-Li0.65(7)Co1.16(2)PO4 as an electrocatalyst elucidates the synergistic effect generated by the structure, composition, and morphology.

Oxygen evolution catalysis fuels the planet through photosynthesis and is a primary means for hydrogen storage in energy technologies. Yet the detection of intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) central to the catalytic mechanism has been an ongoing challenge. This tutorial and minireview covers the relevance of ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of the electrochemical transformations of a metal-oxide surface undergoing OER. Here, we highlight the ultrafast trigger and probes of the electron-doped SrTiO3/electrolyte as the primary example in which light probes across the electromagnetic spectrum have detected intermediate forms. We compare the results to other early transition-metal-oxide surfaces when they exist for select probes and longer timescales. The first part covers how the catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the semiconducting depletion and electrolyte Helmholtz layers. The second part covers the detection of the intermediates that occur upon electron and proton transfer from an adsorbed water species by transient spectroscopy. Their detection by a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and a coherent acoustic wave respectively targets electronic states, vibrational levels, and lattice strain respectively. One of the aims is a tutorial on how these measurements are made and to what extent they allow for the interpretation of experimental spectra by intermediate configurations predicted by theory. Another aim is to describe what these experiments directly recommend in terms of future efforts to visualize the OER intermediates and their dynamics.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology is seen as the most compatible hydrogen production technology with renewable energy generation. However, the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the scarcity of acid-resistant, high-activity, and low-cost catalysts have seriously hindered the overall efficiency and manufacturing costs of PEMWE. Recently, ruthenium (Ru)-based materials have gradually attracted attention due to their suitable binding strength toward oxygen intermediates and lowest price in the noble metal family. Herein, the great achievements and progress of Ru-based acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively reviewed, which started with a general description of reaction mechanisms and in situ characterization techniques to understand the structure–activity relationships. Subsequently, some typical strategies to enhance the activity and stability of Ru-based electrocatalysts are highlighted. Insights from synthesis methods, advanced characterizations, intermediate evolution, and theoretical calculations are provided, together with our viewpoints on the daunting challenges and future endeavors of Ru-based OER electrocatalysts for their practical employment.

With the gradual expansion of the application of organic electromechanical synthesis in the field of energetic materials, it is necessary to explore deeply the mechanisms behind the organic electromechanical oxidation of energetic materials in order to develop efficient electrocatalysts. Electrochemical synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate (ZT) salts is not only environmentally friendly and efficient but also can replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) combined with hydrogen production, significantly reducing the battery voltage of overall water splitting (OWS) and achieving low energy consumption hydrogen production. Here, we prepared the Co-modified nickel-based oxide electrodes (Ni3–xCoO4/carbon cloth (CC), x = 1, 2) as a medium to reveal the oxidative coupling mechanism of 5-aminotetrazole (5-AT). Experimental and theoretical calculations verified that Ni-catalyzed oxidative coupling of 5-AT is a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, including electron transfer of electrocatalytic intermediates (Ni2+–O + OH– = Ni3+–O(OH) + e–) and spontaneous dehydrogenation process (Ni3+–O(OH) + X–H = Ni2+–O + X•). The Ni3+–O(OH) is an extremely fast nonreducing electron transfer center that serves as a chemical oxidant to directly abstract hydrogen atoms from the 5-AT. Simultaneously, the synergistic effect of Co doping on the electric cloud around Ni causes the upshift of the d-band centers, which is conducive to the easier adsorption of OH*, forming the generation of active intermediate Ni3+–O(OH). Thus, Ni2CoO4/CC has higher Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield for the oxidation reaction of 5-AT, with a yield of approximately 72.3% after electrolysis at 1.7 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

Exploiting highly active bifunctional non-noble metal electrocatalysts for reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance for rechargeable Zn–air batteries. Herein, a robust bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst based on N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with CoFe alloys and Fe2N (denoted as CoFe/Fe2N@N-CNTs) has been successfully constructed. The introduction of Fe2N can not only regulate the electronic structure of the FeCo alloy but also provide sufficient metal-Nx catalytic sites. Besides, the strong synergistic effect among CoFe alloy, Fe2N, and N-CNTs endows CoFe/Fe2N@N-CNTs with prominent bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance toward ORR and OER (ΔE = 0.669 V), superior to that of the FeCo alloy@N-CNTs without Fe2N and commercial precious metal-based catalyst. Importantly, the assembled aqueous Zn–air battery (ZAB) possesses a high open-circuit voltage (1.60 V), high peak power density (173 mW cm–2), and prominent good charge–discharge stability (1000 h), surpassing commercial precious metal catalysts.

Electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e– ORR) is a crucial process for on-site and on-demand H2O2 production. Evaluating the impact of the medium's pH is essential for achieving selective H2O2 production at higher current density through continuous O2 supply to gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) in membrane electrolyzers. We investigated the effect of electrolyte pH on both H2O2 production and the flooding behavior of GDEs loaded with a cobalt single-atom catalyst in a typical H-type cell. The electrocatalyst was prepared by heating cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin loaded on Ketjen Black (CoTPP/KB) at 750 °C. Remarkably, the cobalt single-atom catalyst exhibited high current density when the top of the hydrophobic gas-diffusion layer was exposed to the gas phase, facilitating efficient O2 diffusion within the GDE. Potential–time curves at −40 mA cm–2 showed stable potentials and Faradaic efficiencies (>80%) over 5 h across a pH range from 1 to 10, with the H2O2 concentration reaching approximately 100 mmol L–1 at pH 1.0. In contrast, the potential at pH 13 decreased abruptly in 3 h due to the flooding of GDE. Long-term tests demonstrated stable electrocatalytic H2O2 production only in the acidic electrolytes for 24 h, attributed to reduced flooding with decreasing pH. These findings underscore the impact of electrolyte pH on GDE performance during H2O2 production via the 2e– ORR, with acidity favoring the mitigation of undesirable flooding behavior.

Abstract The inefficiency of electrocatalysts for water splitting in neutral media stems from a comprehensive impact of poor intrinsic activity, a limited number of active sites, and inadequate mass transport. Herein, hierarchical ultrathin NiCo 2 Se 4 nanosheets are synthesized by the selenization of NiCo 2 O 4 porous nanoneedles. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity primarily originate from the NiCo 2 Se 4 , whereas the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is related to the NiCoOOH due to the structural reconstruction. The abundant Se and O vacancies introduced by atomically thin nanostructure modulate the electronic structure of NiCo 2 Se 4 and NiCoOOH, thereby improving the intrinsic HER and OER activities, respectively. COMSOL simulation demonstrate the edges of extended nanosheets from the main body significantly promote the charge aggregation, boosting the reduction and oxidation current during HER/OER process. This charge aggregation effect notably exceeds the tip effect for the nanoneedle, highlighting the unique advantage of the hierarchical nanosheet structure. Benefiting from abundant vacancies and unique nanostructure, the hierarchical ultrathin nanosheet simultaneously improve the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrocatalyst.

Developing cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable energy applications. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) made from earth-abundant transition metals, thanks to their remarkable stability and electrocatalytic performance, provide a promising alternative to expensive electrocatalysts typically derived from noble metals. While pristine HEA surfaces have been theoretically investigated, and the effect of oxygen coverage on conventional metal electrocatalysts has been examined, the impact of surface oxygen coverage on the electrocatalytic performance of HEAs remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reconstruct the free energy diagram of OER intermediates on CoFeNiCr HEA surfaces with varying oxygen coverages, evaluating their impact on the rate-limiting step and theoretical overpotential. Our findings reveal that increased oxygen coverage weakens the adsorption of HO* and O*, but not HOO*. As a result, the theoretical overpotential for the OER decreases with higher oxygen coverage, and the rate-limiting step shifts from the third oxidation step (HOO* formation) at low coverage to the first oxidation step (HO* formation) at higher coverage.

This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the burgeoning field of MXene-based electrocatalysts, with a specific focus on their pivotal role in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and empirical evidence, we offer a comprehensive overview of the evolution of both pristine MXenes and hybrid MXenes. Commencing with a succinct synthesis overview, we unravel the intricate relationship between electrocatalytic behavior and essential attributes of MXenes, including their M, X, and T composition, as well as vacancies and morphologies. Additionally, we delve into various strategies aimed at augmenting MXene electrocatalysts, which encompass atom substitution, functionalization, defect engineering, and morphology manipulation. Noteworthy in our discussion is the spotlight on the construction of heterojunctions between MXenes and a diverse array of nanostructures, including metal nanoparticles, oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, and phosphides. This emphasis underscores the significance of synergistic interactions in advancing the performance and versatility of MXene-based electrocatalysts.

Synthesis of high-entropy oxide (HEO) nanocrystals has focused on increasing the temperature in the entropy term (T(ΔS)) to overcome the enthalpy term. However, these high temperatures lead to large, polydisperse nanocrystals. In this work, we leverage the low solubility product (Ksp) of metal oxides and optimize the Lewis-acid-catalyzed esterification reaction for equal rate production of the cation monomers to synthesize HEO nanocrystals at low temperatures, producing the smallest (<4 nm) and most monodisperse (<15% size dispersity) HEOs to date. We apply these HEO nanocrystals as electrocatalysts, exhibiting promising activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media, with an overpotential of 345 mV at 10 mA/cm2.

The quality of in situ XAS of electrochemical systems is highly sensitive to electrode disturbances, such as gas evolution and gas consumption at an electrolyte / catalyst interface. A novel in situ spectro‐electrochemical X‐ray absorption spectroscopy cell is presented as a new tool for the characterisation of gas evolving and consuming electrocatalysts at high overpotentials. By utilising a thin, porous membrane with efficient electrolyte and gas circulating loops, an improved three phase interface that enabled efficient gas supply and minimised the interference from bubble formation. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted in fluorescence mode with three experiments selected to demonstrate the cell’s performance. The first two reactions; an in‐situ study of a highly active amorphous iridium oxide catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction and an in‐situ study of copper oxide during the carbon dioxide reduction reaction are used to exemplify the XAS data quality achieved under operational conditions. Thirdly, a detailed XAS investigation of a highly dispersed platinum catalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction is presented, along with comparative data in nitrogen. These measurements show the retention of oxygen on the surface of the platinum metal particles down to 0.48 V (vs. RHE), well below the platinum oxide reduction peak.

We studied the influence of the surface and crystal lattice about both H2-oxidation reaction and electronic properties of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The oxygen evolution phenomena in CeO2 NPs were observed in reducing (hydrogen or vacuum) atmosphere. In the catalytic hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR) of CeO2, nonstoichiometric CeO2 produces active oxygen species which react with H2 to form H2O. The CeO2 NPs showed the main TPR temperature of the lattice oxygen at around 700 °C (slow reaction). A low temperature peak appeared at around 500 °C, which is originated from the surface of CeO2 (fast reaction). The active oxygen formation was characterized by different activation energies which were newly determined as 77±18 kJmol-1 (on surface) and 131±16 kJmol-1 (in lattice) for NPs, respectively. Regarding with the electric current response of CeO2 NP, we found the relatively fast peak-out peak and then the gradual increase at 300 °C under the low oxygen pressure of 5×10-3 Pa (vacuum). These were both related to the fast and slow release of oxygen on the surface and then in the lattice of CeO2 NPs. The comparative TPR and electric current observations revealed the common reduction behavior on surface and in bulk region of CeO2 NPs.

Abstract LiNi x Co y Al z O 2 (NCA) and LiNi x Co y Mn z O 2 (NCM) have become extensively utilized as cathodes in lithium‐ion batteries for consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and energy storage applications that necessitate consistent power output over prolonged periods and under varying environmental conditions. A crucial structural degradation issue leading to cycling‐induced deterioration, rapid loss of cell capacity/voltage, and the onset of undesirable thermal runaway events involves the decay of cathode materials enriched in nickel. This contribution offers a comprehensive evaluation of cutting‐edge strategies in engineering and material design to enhance the structural stability of cathode materials and reduce detrimental oxygen evolution reactions. It also provides the most recent discoveries regarding oxygen release phenomena and associated mechanisms contributing to structural breakdown in high‐nickel cathodes. The primary source of oxygen depletion and the ensuing structural deterioration caused are thoroughly examined. Additionally, the kinetic mechanisms responsible for oxygen loss are scrutinized, and measures to mitigate resulting electrochemical degradation are elaborated. This overview can guide researchers in the development of oxygen‐containing cathode materials in the future, where oxygen leakage is of lesser concern compared to other forms of deterioration.

Abstract The commercialization of water‐splitting technology strongly relies on the stable and high‐performance electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER‐OER). In this work, the nickel dopants in IrRu alloyed electrocatalyst for acidic water splitting activity are investigated. The incorporation of nickel dopants induces more oxygen atoms coordinating with Ir/Ru facilitating the formation of *OOH species via nucleophilic attack by H 2 O. Additionally, a fast surface reconstruction is achieved due to the electrochemical dissolution of Ni dopants; as a result, more oxygen species are incorporated, evidenced by in situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Therefore, the mass activity for Ni@IrRu is enhanced by threefold than commercial IrO 2 in acidic OER catalysis. Moreover, the nickel dopants balance the hydrogen binding strength; as a result, only 609 mV overpotential is demanded to reach 1 A cm −2 in acidic HER catalysis. The polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) test indicates only 1.87 V is required to attain 2 A cm −2 , 160 mV lower than Pt/C‐IrO 2 revealing its potential application in PEMWE.

Abstract Homogeneous microstructure in lead alloy matrix plays an important role in improving its mechanical and electrochemical properties. In this work, different stirring speed provided during the melt casting of the alloy are tended to obtain lead alloys with different microstructure. The results show that proper stirring speed is beneficial for improving the overall homogeneity of the alloy, however, as the stirring speed is too high, plenty of second phase impurities and defects produced in the lead matrix, which possesses negative effect on the mechanical and electrochemical properties. The most uniform composition and homogeneous microstructure was obtained when the stirring speed is 100 r/min, which is conducive to the decrease of oxygen evolution potential of 30 mV and charge transfer resistance of 22.77%, and the increase of the corrosion resistance of 1.49%, and promote the generation of the uniform and dense PbO2 protective layer.

Abstract To address the rising demand for H_{2} for fuel cells, hydrogen is produced through water splitting (electrochemically/photoelectrochemically).Although perovskite-structured materials show promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), their effectiveness in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses a challenge. Consequently, there's a growing demand for bifunctional catalysts exhibiting high electroactivity across a broad pH range. One potential candidate for exploration as a negative electrode in batteries and fuel cells is LaFeO_{3}. With co-substitution of Sr and Ti, La_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}O_{3} (LSFT) is formed and explored as an air electrode. In this study, we systematically assess LSFT as a bifunctional catalyst across a broad pH spectrum of electrolytic solutions. LSFT displays increased current densities in both the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) domains, alongside improved stability, notably in neutral conditions. Our investigation incorporates Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations to determine surface binding energies and construct a Pourbaix diagram. The results underscore the robustness of LSFT as a perovskite-based bifunctional catalyst, achieving a cycle stability exceeding 600 cycles and a chronopotentiometric stability of 1500 hours with a stable potential of \sim2 V at the current density of 150 mA/cm² in the neutral environment.

Water electrolysis is a sustainable method of hydrogen production with low levels of CO2 emissions. However, the problem of high economic costs must be resolved. Hybrid water electrolysis (HWE), derived by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, emerges as an alternative method to reduce power consumption. Recent studies on HWEs have focused on reporting cell potential reductions, but their impact on hydrogen production costs is still unclear. In this paper, power consumption and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) were evaluated to understand the economic impact of HWEs. Among various HWEs, HzOR showed an excellent energy consumption reduction (43.3 kWh/kg) resulting in the lowest LCOH ($1.92 kg–1). These results prove one of the most effective alternatives to water electrolysis in its current state. Although other HWEs show only small reductions in energy consumption and LCOH in their current state, these reactions still show high potential to reduce energy consumption and LCOH.

Abstract Introducing methane oxidation reaction into the anode of the high-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) can reduce the power consumption for water electrolysis. Compared to the traditional conditions of methane oxidation, the methane oxidation catalyst sintered at the SOEC anode, which is closely related to the cell sintering process. This study uses non-noble metals as active sites for methane oxidation, zirconia, and samarium oxides doped ceria as catalyst support and oxygen ion conductors. The effects of anode sintering temperature on the electrochemical performance of SOEC assisted by methane oxidation were investigated. The results indicate that the high-temperature sintering process promotes the performance of the SOEC anode with Ni as the active site, while high temperature harms the performance of the Co-loaded anode. The sintering temperature exhibits a poor effect on the Fe-loaded anode. The Ni exhibits good enhancement of methane oxidation on reducing the electrolysis voltage of SOEC, while Co only exhibits methane oxidation assistance at low-temperature sintering. Differently, Fe has almost no obvious methane oxidation assistance for SOEC, which mainly represents good oxygen evolution performance.

Abstract Owing to great energy density, eco-friendliness, safety and security, and cost-effectiveness, rechargeable metal-air batteries (MABs) have engrossed substantial devotion. The MABs signify one of the most feasible forthcoming alternatives to powering electric vehicles (EVs) and smart-grid energy storage. The progress of MABs has offered a solution benefitting from its much higher theoretical energy density than that of lithium-ion batteries (LIB). However, certain technical difficulties allied with metal-air batteries include sluggish electrochemical oxygen reaction kinetics that has yet to be fixed. The transition single metal and mixed metals sulfides (TMS) nanostructures have validated an advanced electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, due to their higher electronic conductivity and fast-charge transfer kinetics. The bifunctional electrocatalytic act of the TMSs can be enhanced by altering the electronic configuration, double layer structure and interface, valence state, and vacancies. In this minireview, the preparation, properties, and testing of electrode components of transition metal sulfides (TMS) nanomaterials towards different types of metal-air batteries (aqueous and non-aqueous), the fundamentals, configuration of battery, choice of electrode materials, electrolyte, and separator, current challenges as well as perspectives of the design of high-performance MABs are also discussed based on the existing execution.

Abstract Coordination complexes are promising candidates for powerful electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but challenges remain in favoring the kinetics behaviors through local coordination regulation. Herein, by refining the synergy of carboxylate anions and multiconjugated tripodal benzimidazole ligands, we tailor a series of well-defined and stable coordination complexes (CCs), Ni-tPBA0~3, with three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular/coordinated structures. The coordinated water as potential open coordination sites (OCSs) can directly become intermediates, while the metal center easily achieves re-coordination with water molecules in the pores to resist lattice oxygen dissolution. Specifically, nickel centers with mono-coordinated water undergo the intermolecular oxygen coupling while those with neighboring coordinated water molecules follow an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism (IOM) with a low thermodynamic energy barrier. With more coordinated water introduced, an optimized IOM process appears with the synergy of potential OCSs, enabling fast generation of –Ni–(OH)x intermediate and synchronizing the re-coordination of water molecules with the deprotonation of active –OH for enhanced kinetics. As such, a low overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and long-term stability of 150 h at 100 mA cm–2 was achieved, superior to most single transition metal-based molecular electrocatalysts. This study underscores the potential of crafting the coordinated water molecules for efficient electrocatalysis applications.

Metal atom catalysts have been among the most important research objects due to their specific physical and chemical properties. However, precise control of the anchoring of metal atoms is still challenging to achieve. Cobalt and iridium atomic arrays formed sequentially ordered stable arrays in graphdiyne (GDY) triangular cavities depending on their intrinsic chemical properties and interactions. The success of this method was attributed to multifunctional integration of GDY, enabling selective growth from one to several atoms and various atomic densities. The bimetallic atom arrays show several advantages resulting from reducibility of acetylene bonds, space limiting effect, incomplete charge transfer between GDY and metal atoms, and sp‐C hybridized triple bond skeleton. This well‐designed system exhibits unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a mass activity of 2.6 A mgcat.–1 at a low overpotential of 300 mV, which is 216.6 times higher than the state‐of‐the‐art IrO2 catalyst, and long‐term stability.

Robust engineering of two-dimensional (2D) materials via covalent grafting of organic molecules has been a great strategy for permanently tuningtheir physicochemical behaviors toward electrochemical energy applications. Herein, we demonstrated that a covalent functionalization approach of graphitic surfaces including graphene by a graftable porphyrin (g-Por) derivative, abbreviated as g-Por/HOPG or g-Por/G, is realizable. The efficiency of this approach is determined at both the molecular and global scales by using a state-of-the-art toolbox including cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Consequently, g-Por molecules were proven to covalently graft on graphitic surfaces via C-C bonds, resulting in the formation of a robust novel hybrid 2D material visualized by AFM and STM imaging. Interestingly, the resulting robust molecular material was elucidated as a novel bifunctional catalyst for both the oxygen evolution (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in acidic medium with highly catalytic stability and examined at the molecular level. These findings contribute to an in-depth understanding at the molecular level ofthe contribution of the synergetic effects of molecular structures toward the water-splitting process.

Electrocatalytic water splitting through the electrolyzer is the most promising strategy for hydrogen production. Recently, water electrolysis is mainly based on high‐purity freshwater, which not only consumes a large number of freshwater resources but also improves the overall cost due to the extra water purification system. Hence, direct electrolysis of seawater is more desirable for large‐scale hydrogen generation. As is known, the dominant rate‐determining step of overall water splitting is the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves four‐electron transfer and owns a much larger overpotential than cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction. The large challenge for the design of OER catalysts in the seawater media is the competition reaction between OER and chloride oxidation reaction, which greatly influences energy efficiency. Hence, except for the activity and stability, selectivity is another key point for seawater splitting. Herein, after a brief introduction of two half reactions for water splitting, the latest metal hydr(oxide) electrocatalysts with different crystalline structures are summarized according to the previous reports.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) shows potential for hydrogen production using cost-effective nonplatinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts, achieving high current density performance. However, challenges remain in developing materials, including stable membranes and ionomers under alkaline conditions and non-PGM catalysts that are both high-performing and durable for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study presents an approach for synthesizing highly crystalline carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticle networks using a polyphenolic tannic acid precursor and non-PGM NiFe metal cores, creating a durable OER catalyst. The simplified synthetic process introduces graphitic carbon layers (GCLs) to encompass the NiFe catalytic nanoparticles. Rigorous testing over 1100 h of continuous current operation demonstrates the stability of the catalysts, which is attributed to the robust interaction between the catalyst and the carbon support. The enhanced durability is further confirmed through theoretical calculations, showing greater resistance to corrosion in graphitic carbon compared to defective carbon. This study highlights the importance of highly crystalline carbon structures for achieving both high performance and durability in OER catalysts, which are vital for cost-effective AEMWE technologies. The findings contribute significantly to understanding the role of regulating carbon crystalline properties in developing efficient and durable non-PGM OER electrocatalysts.

IrO2 is the benchmark catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, the high cost and low earth abundance hinder its large‐scale application. Herein, surface‐segregated IrCo nanoparticles on CoO nanosheets with a strong electronic interaction are synthesized through the ion exchange‐pyrolysis method. The resulting IrCo‐CoO heterostructures, containing an ultra‐low Ir content of 4.73 wt %, demonstrate exceptional performance in the acidic OER. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and remarkable stability, with noticeable activity decay observed only after 140 hours of continuous operation. These results surpass most reported Ir‐based electrocatalysts. Specifically, the mass activity at the overpotential of 300 mV for the IrCo‐CoO catalyst reaches 124.52 mA mgIr‐1, which is 20 times higher than that of commercial IrO2. Furthermore, we constructed a home‐made overall water splitting cell utilizing IrCo‐CoO heterostructures as both anode and cathode electrodes, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a voltage of 1.51 V. Our findings present a promising strategy for designing high‐efficient catalysts with significantly reduced noble metals loading.

Consumption of fossil fuels causes greenhouse effect and global warming, hence the need for renewable energy sources that are environmentally friendly. Hydrogen is one of the abundant elements on earth. Hydrogen refers to a clean and renewable energy source, hydrogen can be a good choice to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One way to produce hydrogen is by electrochemical water splitting. This study aims to determine the characterization of iron-based nanomaterials (iron sulfide - iron hydroxide) as a water splitting catalyst in general. Iron sulfide synthesis was carried out using hydrothermal sulfidation method for 6 hours at 80 oC with nickel foam as substrate. Synthesis of iron sulfide varying the concentration of sodium sulfide nonahydrate (0.0125 M, 0.025 M, 0.05 M and 0.1 M) produced brownish yellow to blackish grey colored samples. Characterization results using XRD showed that iron sulfide peaks were detected at higher concentrations of sodium sulfide nonahydrate. Based on the results of analyzing iron hydroxide using SEM, it is known that the sample is in the form of nano walls and on iron sulfide, it is known that the sample is in the form of nanoscale particles. Based on electrochemical measurement results, iron hydroxide can be a good catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with commercial Pt/C. The overpotential of iron hydroxide is smaller than Pt/C, which is only 15 mV at a current density 10 mA/cm2 and iron sulfide can be a good catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with electrocatalytic measurement results close to commercial RuO2. This is indicated by the small overpotential (260 mV at current densisty 10 mA/cm2 and small tafel slope (51 mV/dec).

There has been a recent increasing interest in Zn–air batteries as an alternative to Li-ion batteries. Zn–air batteries possess some significant advantages; however, there are still problems to solve, especially related to the tuning of the properties of the air–cathode which should carry an inexpensive but efficient bifunctional oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reaction electrocatalyst. Biochar can be an alternative, since it is a material of low cost, it exhibits electric conductivity, and it can be used as support for transition metal ions. Although there is a significant number of publications on biochars, there is a lack of data about biochar from raw biomass rich in hemicellulose, and biochar with a small number of heteroatoms, in order to report the pristine activity of the carbon phase. In this work, activated biochar has been made by using corncobs. The biomass was first dried and minced into small pieces and pyrolyzed. Then, it was mixed with KOH and pyrolyzed for a second time. The final product was characterized by various techniques and its electroactivity as a cathode was determined. Physicochemical characterization revealed that the biochar had a hierarchical pore structure, moderate surface area of 92 m2 g−1, carbon phase with a relatively low sp2/sp3 ratio close to one, and a limited amount of N and S, but a high number of oxygen groups. The graphitization was not complete while the biochar had an ordered structure and contained significant O species. This biochar was used as an electrocatalyst for ORR and OER in Zn–air batteries where it demonstrated a satisfactory performance. More specifically, it reached an open-circuit voltage of about 1.4 V, which was stable over a period of several hours, with a short-circuit current density of 142 mA cm−2 and a maximum power density of 55 mW cm−2. Charge–discharge cycling of the battery was achieved between 1.2 and 2.1 V for a constant current of 10 mA. These data show that corncob biochar demonstrated good performance as an electrocatalyst in Zn–air batteries, despite its low specific surface and low sp2/sp3 ratio, owing to its rich oxygen sites, thus showing that electrocatalysis is a complex phenomenon and can be served by biochars of various origins.

Abstract Efficient, stable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts are essential to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process during water electrolysis applications. 2D transition metal carbides (MXene) show great potential in functional heterogeneous interface engineering for electrocatalytic OER. However, it is still a challenge to regulate the interlayer space and realize the heterogeneous layer‐by‐layer ordered embedding for MXene. Herein, a simple hydrothermal‐assisted strategy is proposed to prepare highly conductive Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene supported by synergized Ni 2+ , Co 2+ , and Fe 3+ with bilayer H 2 O, which significantly enlarges the interlayer distances and improves the interlayer ion concentrations. Benefiting from modulated interface chemistry, embedded metal ions undergo multi‐directional in situ growth on the MXene substrate, thereby forming a stable 0D/2D@2D nano‐hybrid material (NiFe/MX‐HT). Combining density functional theory calculations with experiments demonstrates that MXene offers a framework for electron transfer, enhances the exposure of active sites, modulates the electronic structure, and greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step in the process of OER. Thus, NiFe/MX‐HT requires only 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 and maintains stability even after operating at 100 mA cm −2 for 150 h. This work offers new insights into exploring various functional MXene‐based heterogeneous materials.

Abstract This chapter examines how networks of cooperating and competing species can reach a flexible stability, simultaneously remaining stable while retaining the ability to evolve in many directions. Cooperation among species alone cannot explain this, because such cooperation can only evolve if it makes the participating species, acting as a unit, better overall competitors in the larger ecosystem. We explore how these continually shifting cooperative and competitive interactions can result in a flexible, rather than an ossified, stable state. Remarkable new adaptations are free to appear, along with avenues for other members of the ecosystems to adapt to them. Such ecosystem flexibility explains the history of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. This system, on which almost all of Earth’s life now depends, began its evolution as types of more-limited anoxygenic photosynthesis in two bacterial lineages. Gene transfers brought these photosynthetic mechanisms together in a third bacterial lineage. There, they evolved cooperative interactions that allowed them to use carbon dioxide and water to generate chemical energy and release gaseous oxygen as a “waste” product. This did not result in the immediate death of all anaerobic organisms that were sensitive to oxygen, however. We explore why, in spite of the overwhelming advantage of oxygenic photosynthesis, it took two billion years for oxygenic photosynthetic organisms to fully take over the planet. This was because ecosystems still had many routes by which their species could adapt to this new selective factor, slowing its advance and increasing life’s complexity and flexibility at the same time.

Rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes affects the performance of a semiconductor device and limits the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. The use of an S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction catalyst for the separation of photogenerated charge carriers is a feasible approach to achieve high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Therefore, we synthesized a three-dimensional S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4) and investigated its activity in photocatalytic water splitting. An analysis of the band structure (XPS, UPS, and Mott–Schottky) indicated effective interfacial charge transfer in an S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction composed of two n-type semiconductors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirmed that the light-induced charge transfer followed the S-scheme mechanism. Based on the capture test (EPR) of •OH free radicals, it can be seen that the enhanced activity is attributed to the S-scheme carrier migration mechanism in heterojunction, which promotes the rapid adsorption of H+ by the abundant amino sites in g-C3N4, thus effectively generating H2. The 2D/2D LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4 heterojunction has a good interface and produces a built-in electric field, improving the separation of e– and h+ while increasing the oxygen vacancy. The synergistic effect of the heterostructure and oxygen vacancy makes the photocatalyst significantly better than LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and g-C3N4 in visible light. The hydrogen evolution rate of the composite catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4-70 wt %) was 34.50 mmol·h–1·g–1, which was 40.6 times and 9.2 times higher than that of the catalysts (LaNiO3 and g-C3N4), respectively. After 25 h of cyclic testing, the catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4-70 wt %) composite material still exhibited excellent hydrogen evolution performance and photostability. It was confirmed that the synergistic effect between abundant active sites, enriched oxygen vacancies, and 2D/2D heterojunctions improved the photoinduced carrier separation and the light absorption efficiency of visible light. This study opens up new possibilities for the logical design of efficient photodecomposition using 2D/2D heterojunctions combined with oxygen vacancies.

Ultramassive white dwarfs with masses $M\gtrsim 1.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ probe extreme physics near the Chandrasekhar limit. Despite the rapid increase in observations, it is still unclear how many harbour carbon-oxygen (CO) versus oxygen-neon (ONe) cores. The origin of these white dwarfs and their strong magnetic fields - single stellar evolution or a stellar merger - is another open question. The steep mass-radius relation of the relativistic ultramassive white dwarfs shortens their crystallization time $t_{\rm cryst}$, such that the recently proposed crystallization dynamo mechanism may present an alternative to mergers in explaining the early appearance of magnetism in the observed population. However, the magnetic diffusion time from the convective dynamo to the white dwarf's surface delays the magnetic field's breakout time $t_{\rm break}>t_{\rm cryst}$. We compute $t_{\rm break}(M)$ for CO and ONe ultramassive white dwarfs and compare it to the local 40 pc volume-limited sample. We find that the breakout time from CO cores is too long to account for the observations. ONe crystallization dynamos remain a viable option, but their surrounding non-convective envelopes comprise only a few per cent of the total mass, such that $t_{\rm break}$ is highly sensitive to the details of stellar evolution.

An interplay between Pd and PdO and their spatial distribution inside the particles are relevant for numerous catalytic reactions. Using in situ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) supported by theoretical simulations, a mechanistic picture of the structural evolution of 2.3 nm palladium nanoparticles upon their exposure to molecular oxygen is provided. XAS analysis revealed the restructuring of the fcc-like palladium surface into the 4-coordinated structure of palladium oxide upon absorption of oxygen from the gas phase and formation of core@shell Pd@PdO structures. The reconstruction starts from the low-coordinated sites at the edges of palladium nanoparticles. Formation of the PdO shell does not affect the average Pd‒Pd coordination numbers, since the decrease of the size of the metallic core is compensated by a more spherical shape of the oxidized nanoparticles due to a weaker interaction with the support. The metallic core is preserved below 200 °C even after continuous exposure to oxygen, with its size decreasing insignificantly upon increasing the temperature, while above 200 °C, bulk oxidation proceeds. The Pd‒Pd distances in the metallic phase progressively decrease upon increasing the fraction of the Pd oxide due to the alignment of the cell parameters of the two phases.

Sequential excitation energy and electron transfer (ET) are ubiquitous pathways for converting solar energy to chemical energy in photosynthesis. Mimicking this unique process for chemical synthesis is promising yet still a big challenge. Herein, taking photosynthesis as an inspiration, we demonstrate an interesting pathway for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an important and valuable commodity chemical. The proposed route was verified on a biomimetic photocatalyst, i.e., an aluminum porphyrin metal–organic framework nanosheet (Al–TCPP). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the dioxygen molecule is first converted to a highly active singlet oxygen intermediate through an excitation energy transfer (EET) and then reduced to H2O2 via the photogenerated electrons with a reduced barrier over Al–TCPP. Consequently, Al–TCPP shows a 32 times higher H2O2 evolution rate than that of the pristine TCPP counterpart, wherein excitation energy transfer mainly exists. This study presents a paradigm to mimic the photosynthetic sequential excitation energy and electron-transfer process for improved synthesis of valuable commodity chemicals.

Plasma oxidation of metals has been studied extensively to fabricate nanoporous oxides with the merits of room temperature treatment and facile control of the oxidation rate. Plasma oxidation of Ag, motivated by studies on atomic oxygen corrosion of Ag, is one of the most studied systems. However, several important questions remain unaddressed and even overlooked traditionally: the critical role played by atomic O in promoting oxidation, evolution of microstructures during plasma exposure, and a sound framework for quantitative oxidation kinetic analyses. In this paper, the O2 plasma oxidation behavior of Ag films deposited on Si substrates was systematically studied both experimentally and theoretically. The effects of plasma pressure and power on the microstructural evolution and oxidation kinetics of Ag films of various thicknesses were investigated using comprehensive characterization, as well as numerical analysis of plasma chemistry for deriving atomic O concentration. The findings here provide a full picture and deep mechanistic insights into the morphology and microstructure evolution of Ag films and the growth of dense or porous Ag2O and AgO oxide layers by plasma oxidation, revealing the intricate interplay between atomic O, vacancy creation, Ag ion diffusion, Kirkendall effect, formation of pores, and interfacial void coalescence. The methodology developed here can be easily transferred to help understand the plasma oxidation behavior of other metals.

Carbon deposits consisting of vertically oriented multilayer graphene sheets on metallic foils represent an interesting alternative to activated carbon in electrical and electrochemical devices such as super-capacitors because of the superior electrical conductivity of graphene and huge surface–mass ratio. The graphene sheets were deposited on cobalt foils by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using propane as the carbon precursor. Plasma was sustained by an inductively coupled radiofrequency discharge in the H mode at a power of 500 W and a propane pressure of 17 Pa. The precursor effectively dissociated in plasma conditions and enabled the growth of porous films consisting of multilayer graphene sheets. The deposition rate varied with time and peaked at 100 nm/s. The evolution of surface wettability was determined by the sessile drop method. The untreated substrates were moderately hydrophobic at a water contact angle of about 110°. The contact angle dropped to about 50° after plasma treatment for less than a second and increased monotonously thereafter. The maximal contact angle of 130° appeared at a treatment time of about 30 s. Thereafter, it slowly decreased, with a prolonged deposition time. The evolution of the wettability was explained by surface composition and morphology. A brief treatment with oxygen plasma enabled a super-hydrophilic surface finish of the films consisting of multilayer graphene sheets.

Production efficiency of solar-driven hydrogen (H2) through water splitting relies strongly on the activity and stability of semiconductor photocatalysts. Black TiO2 semiconductors have shown specific promise for photocatalysis due to their enhanced solar light absorption by the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ species, but their fabrication and functionalization are very challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx (MXene)-derived black TiO2 with atomically anchored nickel (Ni) species for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Advanced characterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy verified the presence of Ni–O bonds, confirming that the Ni atoms are coordinated with the surrounding O atoms from anatase black TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (TiO2–Ov). The introduction of atomic Ni species onto black TiO2–Ov promoted the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, thus leading to a significant enhancement in photocatalytic H2 production. Specifically, our Ni–TiO2–Ov delivered a H2 production rate of 697.44 μmol g–1 h–1 under 365 nm light-emitting diode light, which is 3.7 times higher than that of the system with bare black TiO2–Ov. This work paves the way to the design of functional black TiO2 materials using a facile and low-cost strategy.

Late Devonian aquatic environments hosted the fin-to-limb transition in vertebrates. Upper Devonian (ca. 365−360 Ma) strata in Pennsylvania, USA, preserve a diversity of fishes and tetrapods in coastal marine to fluvial depositional environments, making this region ideal for investigating the ecology and evolution of Late Devonian vertebrates. A key unresolved issue has been reconstructing the specific aquatic habitats that hosted various vertebrates during this period. Specifically, the salinity of environments spanning fresh to shallow marine water is difficult to discern from sedimentological and paleontological analyses alone. Here, we analyze rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) as well as stable oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions (δ18O, δ34S) in fossil vertebrate bioapatite from late Famennian (ca. 362−360 Ma) strata of the Catskill and Lock Haven formations in the Appalachian Basin, USA, to determine the relative salinity of their aquatic environments. These results confirm the ecological euryhalinity of several taxa (Bothriolepis sp., tristichopterids, and Holoptychius sp.). Our results are the first demonstrating that some early tetrapod species occupied unequivocally freshwater habitats by late Famennian time (ca. 362−360 Ma). Our study shows that integrating sedimentological and paleontological data with combined oxygen and sulfur isotope analysis allows precise tracing of the relative salinity of vertebrate habitats deep in the past.

Abstract. The study of isotopic ratios of atmospheric oxygen in fossilized air trapped in ice core bubbles provides information on variations in the hydrological cycle at low latitudes and productivity in the past. However, to refine these interpretations, it is necessary to better quantify fractionation of oxygen in the biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. We set up a system of closed biological chambers in which we studied the evolution of elemental and isotopic composition of O2 due to biological processes. To easily replicate experiments, we developed a multiplexing system which we describe here. We compared measurements of elemental and isotopic composition of O2 using two different measurement techniques: optical spectrometry (Optical-Feedback Cavity- Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy, i.e. OF-CEAS technique), which enables higher temporal resolution and continuous data collection and isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) with a flanged air recovery system, thus validating the data analysis conducted through the OF-CEAS technique. As a first application, we investigated isotopic discrimination during respiration and photosynthesis. We conducted a 5-day experiment using maize (Zea mays L.) as model species. The 18O discrimination value for maize during dark plant respiration was determined as - 17.8 ± 0.9 ‰ by IRMS and - 16.1 ± 1.1 ‰ by optical spectrometer. We also found a value attributed to the isotopic discrimination of terrestrial photosynthesis equal to + 3.2 ± 2.6 ‰ by IRMS and + 6.7 ± 3.8 ‰ by optical spectrometer. These findings were consistent with a previous study by Paul et al. (2023).

This study, placed in the context of the preparation for the Uranus Orbiter Probe mission, aims to predict the bulk volatile compositions of Uranus and Neptune. Using a protoplanetary disk model, it examines the evolution of trace species through vapor and solid transport as dust and pebbles. Due to the high carbon abundance found in their envelopes, the two planets are postulated to have formed at the carbon monoxide iceline within the protosolar nebula. The time evolution of the abundances of the major volatile species at the location of the CO iceline is then calculated to derive the abundance ratios of the corresponding key elements, including the heavy noble gases, in the feeding zones of Uranus and Neptune. Supersolar metallicity in their envelopes likely results from accreting solids in these zones. Two types of solids are considered: pure condensates (Case 1) and a mixture of pure condensates and clathrates (Case 2). The model, calibrated to observed carbon enrichments, predicts deep compositions. In Case 1, argon is deeply depleted, while nitrogen, oxygen, krypton, phosphorus, sulfur, and xenon are significantly enriched relative to their protosolar abundances in the two planets. Case 2 predicts significant enrichments for all species, including argon, relative to their protosolar abundances. Consequently, Case 1 predicts near-zero Ar/Kr or Ar/Xe ratios, while Case 2 suggests these ratios are 0.1 and 0.5-1 times their protosolar ratios. Both cases predict a bulk sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio consistent with atmospheric measurements.

We present here initial results of our spectro-photometric monitoring of XZ Tau. During our monitoring period, XZ Tau exhibited several episodes of brightness variations in timescales of months at optical wavelengths in contrast to the mid-infrared wavelengths. The color evolution of XZ Tau during this period suggests that the brightness variations are driven by changes in accretion from the disc. The mid-infrared light curve shows an overall decline in brightness by ∼ 0.5 and 0.7 magnitude respectively in WISE W1 (3.4 μm) and W2 (4.6 μm) bands. The emission profile of the hydrogen recombination lines along with that of Ca II IRT lines points towards magnetospheric accretion of XZ Tau. We have detected P Cygni profile in Hβ indicating of out-flowing winds from regions close to accretion. Forbidden transitions of oxygen are also detected, likely indicating jets originating around the central pre-main sequence star.

Abstract Geological evidence indicates that a supernova within 100 parsecs of Earth occurs around once per million years. Such nearby supernovas can produce an intense gamma-ray burst and a 100-fold increase of cosmic rays, lasting several centuries. We find that the effect of a short burst of gamma rays is small since they are strongly attenuated before reaching the lower stratosphere. Intense cosmic radiation affects stratospheric ozone but, due to compensating effects in catalytic chemical cycles, ozone depletion is moderate and comparable to that from current anthropogenic emissions. This also holds for the low-oxygen atmosphere during early evolution of terrestrial life. We estimate the increase in aerosol and clouds from a 100-fold increase of cosmic rays exerts a radiative forcing comparable in magnitude but opposite in sign to current anthropogenic climate forcing. We conclude that Earth’s atmosphere is effective at shielding the biosphere from nearby supernovae.

Developing efficient and low-cost catalysts is crucial to hydrogen generation through water electrolysis. Oxygen-functionalized titanium carbide MXene holds tremendous potential in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, appropriate modulation approaches aiming at optimizing the HER performance of these MXenes have not been systematically investigated. In this work, density functional theory was employed to screen the optimal HER operating conditions of Tin+1CnO2 (n = 1–3) by introducing carbon (C) vacancy modification coupled with strain engineering. Terminal oxygen atoms of pristine Ti2CO2 are identified as excellent reactive sites at relatively low hydrogen coverage, while those of Ti3C2O2 and Ti4C3O2 can reach an ideal catalytic state at high hydrogen coverage. An effective fine-tuning of reactive sites on these pristine MXenes can be achieved by exerting a biaxial strain. Besides, C vacancy can breed its nearest neighbor O atoms as active sites for Ti3C2O2 and Ti4C3O2, and their intrinsically excessive hydrogen adsorption would be weakened with the Gibbs free energies regulated extremely close to 0 eV. Detailed analyses indicate that more electrons are transferred to O atoms adjacent to the introduced C vacancy with the O-2p band center downshifting toward lower energy, thus weakening MXenes' capability in capturing hydrogen. Taken together, by collaborating biaxial strain with a C vacancy, Ti3C2O2 and Ti4C3O2 can perform with more outstanding reactive sites at a wider hydrogen coverage, while Ti2CO2 can perform only at low coverage. Our theoretical results point out reasonable regulation strategies for the desirable HER catalytic performance of Tin+1CnO2.

Life harnessing light energy transformed the relationship between biology and Earth-bringing a massive flux of organic carbon and oxidants to Earth's surface that gave way to today's organotrophy- and respiration-dominated biosphere. However, our understanding of how life drove this transition has largely relied on the geological record; much remains unresolved due to the complexity and paucity of the genetic record tied to photosynthesis. Here, through holistic phylogenetic comparison of the bacterial domain and all photosynthetic machinery (totally spanning >10,000 genomes), we identify evolutionary congruence between three independent biological systems-bacteria, (bacterio)chlorophyll-mediated light metabolism (chlorophototrophy), and carbon fixation-and uncover their intertwined history. Our analyses uniformly mapped progenitors of extant light-metabolizing machinery (reaction centers, [bacterio]chlorophyll synthases, and magnesium-chelatases) and enzymes facilitating the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (form I RuBisCO and phosphoribulokinase) to the same ancient Terrabacteria organism near the base of the bacterial domain. These phylogenies consistently showed that extant phototrophs ultimately derived light metabolism from this bacterium, the last phototroph common ancestor (LPCA). LPCA was a non-oxygen-generating (anoxygenic) phototroph that already possessed carbon fixation and two reaction centers, a type I analogous to extant forms and a primitive type II. Analyses also indicate chlorophototrophy originated before LPCA. We further reconstructed evolution of chlorophototrophs/chlorophototrophy post-LPCA, including vertical inheritance in Terrabacteria, the rise of oxygen-generating chlorophototrophy in one descendant branch near the Great Oxidation Event, and subsequent emergence of Cyanobacteria. These collectively unveil a detailed view of the coevolution of light metabolism and Bacteria having clear congruence with the geological record.

Abstract Anthropogenic stressors can have an impact in a broad range of physiological processes and can be a major selective force leading to rapid evolution and local population adaptation. In this study, three populations of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii were investigated. They are geographically separated for at least 20 years, and live in different abiotic environments: a freshwater inland lake (Salagou lake) with no major anthropogenic influence and two other coastal wetlands regularly polluted by pesticides along the Mediterranean coast (Camargue region and Bages-Sigean lagoon). Collected adults were genetically characterized using the mitochondrial COI gene and haplotype frequencies were analyzed for genetic variability within and between populations. Results revealed a higher genetic diversity for these invasive populations than any previous report in France, with more than seven different haplotypes in a single population. The contrasting genetic diversity between the Camargue and the other two populations suggest different times and sources of introduction. To identify differences in key physiological responses between these populations, individuals from each population were maintained in controlled conditions. Data on oxygen consumption rates indicate that the Salagou and Bages-Sigean populations possess a high inter-individual variability compared to the Camargue population. The low individual variability of oxygen consumption and low genetic diversity suggest a specific local adaptation for the Camargue population. Population-specific responses were identified when individuals were exposed to a pesticide cocktail containing azoxystrobin and oxadiazon at sublethal concentrations. The Salagou population was the only one with altered hydro-osmotic balance due to pollutant exposure and a change in protease activity in the hepatopancreas. These results revealed different phenotypic responses suggesting local adaptations at the population level.

Ab initio calculations have achieved remarkable success in nuclear structure studies. Numerous works highlight the pivotal role of three-body forces in nuclear ab initio calculations. Concurrently, efforts have been made to replicate these calculations using only realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. A novel local chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) NN interaction, distinct due to its weaker tensor force, has recently been established. This paper applies this local NN interaction in ab initio frameworks to calculate the low-lying spectra of p-shell light nuclei, particularly 10B, ground-state energies and shell evolution in oxygen isotopes. Results are compared with calculations utilizing nonlocal chiral N3LO NN and chiral NN +3N interactions. The ab initio calculations with the local N N potential accurately describe the spectra of p-shell nuclei, notably the 10B. Additionally, the neutron drip line for oxygen isotopes, with 24O as the drip line nucleus, is accurately reproduced in ab initio calculations with the local NN interaction. Calculations with the local NN interaction also reproduce the subshell closure at N = 14 and 16, albeit with a stronger shell gap compared to experimental data. However, the calculated charge radii based on the local NN interaction are underestimated compared with experimental data, which is similar to results from the nonlocal NN interaction. Consequently, the present ab initio calculations further indicate significant spin-orbit splitting effects with the new local NN potential, suggesting that 3N forces remain an important consideration.

Optical signals with distinctive properties, such as contactless, fast response, and high identification, are harnessed to realize advanced anti-counterfeiting. However, the simultaneous attainment of multi-color, -temporal, and -modal luminescence performance remains a compelling and imperative pursuit. In our work, a temperature/photon-responded dynamic self-activated luminescence originating from nonstoichiometric Zn2GeO4 is developed with the modulation of intrinsic defects. The increased concentration of oxygen vacancies (VO••) contributes to an enhanced recombination of ZnGe″–VO••, ultimately improving the self-activated luminescence performance. Additionally, the photoluminescence (PL) color of the representative Zn2.2GeO4 sample changes from green to blue–white with the increased ultraviolet (UV) irradiation time. Concurrently, the emission color undergoes a variation from blue to green as the ambient temperature raises from 280 to 420 K. Remarkably, green long persistent luminescence (LPL) and photostimulated luminescence (PSL) behaviors are observed. Herein, this study elucidates a sophisticated anti-counterfeiting approach grounded in the dynamic luminescent attributes of nonstoichiometric Zn2GeO4, presenting a promising frontier for the evolution of anti-counterfeiting technologies.

Vascular pathologies are prevalent in a broad spectrum of diseases, necessitating a deeper understanding of vascular biology, particularly in overcoming the oxygen and nutrient diffusion limit in tissue constructs. The evolution of vascularized tissues signifies a convergence of multiple scientific disciplines, encompassing the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into vascular cells, the development of advanced three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques, and the refinement of bioinks. These technologies are instrumental in creating intricate vascular networks essential for tissue viability, especially in thick, complex constructs. This review provides broad perspectives on the past, current state, and advancements in key areas, including the differentiation of hPSCs into specific vascular lineages, the potential and challenges of 3D bioprinting methods, and the role of innovative bioinks mimicking the native extracellular matrix. We also explore the integration of biophysical cues in vascularized tissues in vitro , highlighting their importance in stimulating vessel maturation and functionality. In this review, we aim to synthesize these diverse yet interconnected domains, offering a broad, multidisciplinary perspective on tissue vascularization. Advancements in this field will help address the global organ shortage and transform patient care.

Ab initio calculations have achieved remarkable success in nuclear structure studies. Numerous works highlight the pivotal role of three-body forces in nuclear ab initio calculations. Concurrently, efforts have been made to replicate these calculations using only realistic nucleon-nucleon $(NN)$ interactions. A novel local chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order $({\mathrm{N}}^{3}\mathrm{LO})$ $NN$ interaction, distinct due to its weaker tensor force, has recently been established. This paper applies this local $NN$ interaction in ab initio frameworks to calculate the low-lying spectra of $p$-shell light nuclei, particularly $^{10}\mathrm{B}$, ground-state energies and shell evolution in oxygen isotopes. Results are compared with calculations utilizing nonlocal chiral ${\mathrm{N}}^{3}\mathrm{LO}\phantom{\rule{4pt}{0ex}}NN$ and chiral $NN+3N$ interactions. The ab initio calculations with the local $NN$ potential accurately describe the spectra of $p$-shell nuclei, notably the $^{10}\mathrm{B}$. Additionally, the neutron drip line for oxygen isotopes, with $^{24}\mathrm{O}$ as the drip line nucleus, is accurately reproduced in ab initio calculations with the local $NN$ interaction. Calculations with the local $NN$ interaction also reproduce the subshell closure at $N=14$ and 16, albeit with a stronger shell gap compared to experimental data. However, the calculated charge radii based on the local $NN$ interaction are underestimated compared with experimental data, which is similar to results from the nonlocal $NN$ interaction. Consequently, the present ab initio calculations further indicate significant spin-orbit splitting effects with the new local $NN$ potential, suggesting that 3N forces remain an important consideration.

We present a study of three highly non-radial solar wind events in which the azimuthal solar wind flow angle exceeds 6° for one day or more. None of the events are associated with coronal mass ejections and co-rotating interaction regions observed at 1 AU. For all events, the solar wind outflows at 1 AU exhibit low velocity and density. Based on the significant increase in the oxygen charge state ratio of O7+/O6+ at 1 AU for all of the events, we have traced them back to the Sun and found that their source regions originated in active region and coronal hole (AR-CH) pairs mainly located at the central meridian. Furthermore, examining the dynamical evolutions in their source regions using both the Extreme ultra-violet Imaging Telescope and the Michelson Doppler Imager, we found that the changes taking place in AR-CH boundaries eventually disturbed the stable CH configurations, resulting in a reduction of the CH area and finally its disappearance, leaving only with the AR. Our study provides a possible explanation for discussing the origin of the prolonged and highly non-radial solar wind flows.

Abstract Spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiters measure their emission spectra at multiple orbital phases, thus enabling detailed characterisation of their atmospheres. Precise constraints on the atmospheric composition of these exoplanets offer insights into their formation and evolution. We analyse four phase-resolved emission spectra of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, generated from a phase curve observed with the MIRI/LRS onboard the JWST, to retrieve its atmospheric properties. Using a parametric 2D temperature model and assuming a chemically homogeneous atmosphere within the observed pressure region, we simultaneously fit the four spectra to constrain the abundances of atmospheric constituents, thereby yielding more precise constraints than previous work that analysed each spectrum independently. Our analysis reveals statistically significant evidence of NH3 (4σ) in a hot Jupiter’s emission spectra for the first time, along with evidence of H2O (6.5σ), CO (3.1σ), and a non-detection of CH4. With our abundance constraints, we tentatively estimate the metallicity of WASP-43b at 0.6−6.5 × solar and its C/O ratio at 0.6−0.9. Our findings offer vital insights into the atmospheric conditions and formation history of WASP-43b by simultaneously constraining the abundances of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen-bearing species.

This issue focuses on the multifaceted nature of hydrogen, exploring the latest research, advancements, and applications in this rapidly evolving field. Topics covered include hydrogen production methods, advancements in storage technologies, diverse applications, and the significance of hydrogen sensing for monitoring its environmental impact. Hydrogen is emerging as a transformative force in the global energy landscape, offering a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable pathway towards a carbon-neutral future. Its potential spans multiple domains – production, storage, applications, and sensing – each critical to the transition away from fossil fuels. As the world grapples with the impacts of climate change and the urgency to decarbonize energy systems, hydrogen's role becomes increasingly significant. This special issue focuses on the multifaceted nature of hydrogen, exploring the latest research, advancements, and applications that are shaping this rapidly evolving field. Realizing the full potential of hydrogen necessitates collaborative efforts from policymakers, industry stakeholders, and the scientific community. Investments in research and development, infrastructure development, and regulatory frameworks are crucial to scaling up hydrogen technologies in production, storage, application, and sensing. Hydrogen's impact spans decarbonization, energy security, air quality improvement, energy storage, industrial applications, transportation, and energy transit. By harnessing the power of hydrogen technologies, we can effectively tackle pressing environmental challenges, enhance energy security, and foster economic growth while creating a cleaner and healthier planet for future generations. Researchers, economists, industrialists, and politicians are actively considering a shift away from fossil fuels towards electrification and hydrogen as energy sources. Whether derived from renewable sources or hydrocarbons with carbon dioxide sequestration, hydrogen offers a viable pathway to mitigate climate change. In light of the multitude of challenges inherent in this energy transition, this special collection serves as a bridge, connecting the realms of chemistry and application in the hydrogen economy. Within this collection, we have curated a selection of valuable review articles and research papers that delve into various aspects of hydrogen production, storage, application, and sensing. In the sections below, we will introduce some insightful contributions, shedding light on the advancements and discoveries shaping the hydrogen landscape. In the context of global electricity surplus, the concept of storing electric energy through green hydrogen production offers a nearly infinite, clean, long-term, and scalable energy storage capacity. However, the reality of such abundant electric energy remains uncertain. Therefore, producing clean hydrogen from hydrocarbons should not be overlooked in meeting the world's energy demands. In this regard, Maeno et al. describe the production of syngas (CO and H2) through chemical looping dry reforming of methane over Ni-modified MoO3/ZrO2. Hardiantoa et al. describe the identification of an appropriate commercial stainless-steel mesh size for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction, which holds significance for the process of electrochemical hydrogen production from water. Additionally, Islam et al. summarize recent advancements in several platinum-free electro-catalysts relevant to hydrogen evolution from water reduction. Das et al. discuss the recent progress made towards sustainable environmental applications of Cu2ZnSnS4-based nanomaterials in photocatalytic and hydrogen production. Ihsanullah focuses on harnessing nanomaterials for enhanced biohydrogen generation from wastewater, and Baig et al. summarize recent advancements in metal-organic framework-based membranes for hydrogen separation. Hydrogen poses challenges in terms of storage, as significant amounts require high-pressure gaseous storage or energy-intensive cryogenic storage. Geological formation hydrogen storage, while a potential option for the future, is unsuitable for hydrogen transportation. Immediate storage methods include liquid organic hydrogen carriers, solid adsorbents, and metal hydrides. Ferdous et al. present a comprehensive review of advancements in biomass-derived activated carbon for sustainable hydrogen storage in this issue. Similarly, Wahab et al. describe enhanced hydrogen storage in solid-state materials, unlocking the potential of magnesium borohydride through nanoconfinement and catalysis. Ali et al. provide a brief account of MXenes for catalyzing solid-state hydrogen storage. Additionally, Mansha et al. discuss recent developments, challenges, and prospects of chemical-based hydrogen storage systems. Hydrogen is a versatile chemical element with potential uses across various industries, including "hard to abate" sectors such as aviation, as well as in steel, aluminum, and concrete production. Hydrogenation reactions are already widespread in the petrochemical industry. The future usage of hydrogen in power generation, whether through hydrogen-fueled gas turbines or continued use of fossil fuels with carbon capture, remains a subject of debate. In this issue, Motokura describes interparticle hydrogen spillover in enhanced catalytic reactions, while Miyazaki et al. present an in-situ spectroscopic study of CO2 capture and methanation over Ni−Ca-based dual-functional materials. Tracking hydrogen and monitoring its environmental impact is crucial in transitioning to a hydrogen economy. Even green hydrogen has its environmental footprint. Integrating with AI and autonomous sensing, advanced hydrogen sensing technology elevates the field to IR 5.0. In this issue, Fegade et al. describe high-selectivity hydrogen gas sensors based on mesoporous PbOx-ZnO nanocomposites, while Rahman et al. summarize hydrogen sensing with palladium-based materials, including mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities. In summary, the hydrogen economy presents a more compelling energy transition strategy compared to electrification alone. Nonetheless, critical areas such as hydrogen production, storage, transportation, utilization, safety, and accountability need thorough research and innovative solutions. While political factors will heavily influence the development of the hydrogen economy, the scientific community must play a key role in providing solutions that will help this field mature and support informed decision-making. With joint efforts, hydrogen could indeed transform our energy systems and lead us towards a greener future. S. M. A.

Abstract The advancement of renewable energy is intricately relied on the development of diverse sustainable electrochemical devices. Persuing exceptionally efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is imperative, as it promises to significantly streamline the electrode fabrication process, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of these devices. Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalysts of N‐doped carbon (NC) supported intermetallic PtZn catalyst (PtZn‐IMC@NC) are reported, which performs highly attractively toward the electrocatalysis of glycerol oxidation reactions (GOR), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Its effectiveness are demonstrated as electrocatalysts for both the anode and cathode in a hybrid acid/alkali direct glycerol fuel cell (AA‐DGFC) and a hybrid acid/alkali glycerol‐hydrogen electrolyzer (AA‐GHEC). The AA‐DGFC can release an impressive peak power density of 286.8 mW cm −2 , while the AA‐GHEC achieves a noteworthy current density of 100 mA cm −2 at a significantly low applied voltage of 0.47 V. Such intermetallic PtZn‐based trifunctional electrocatalyst empowers them to establish a self‐powered integrated electrochemical device with the AA‐DGFC driving the AA‐GHEC. This setup exemplifies efficient valorization of glycerol into formate in both cells and hydrogen production in electrolyzer device. This study sparks innovation across diverse applications of multifunctional electrocatalysts and infuses renewed momentum into the realm of advanced energy devices.

In the development of advanced energy saving technologies in the metallurgical industry, a comprehensive approach to managing energy flows is crucial. This article presents an in-depth analysis of the steelmaking and metallurgical industry in China and Russia, focusing on the evolution and current shortcomings of energy saving methods in metallurgical processes. The authors thoroughly analyze various technological processes, including sintering, coking, pellet production, iron production in blast furnaces, steel production in oxygen converters and electric arc furnaces, as well as steel rolling, identifying significant potential for enhancing energy efficiency and reducing harmful emissions. The main outcome of the research is the development of structural models of technological processes based on the concept of energy saving “temperature matching, cascade utilization, and global linkage”, covering key stages of steelmaking. These models provide detailed descriptions of the role and interrelation of each process within the complete metallurgical cycle and combine into a comprehensive structural model of steelmaking technological process. The model includes not only specific operations and characteristics of each stage but also explains how these processes interact and depend on each other, forming an integrated and interconnected system of metallurgical production. This model encompasses comprehensive temperature-pressure and production links, providing a theoretical basis for the development of mathematical models of energy saving and the design of corresponding computer applications. The structural model of steelmaking technological process is important for understanding and optimizing the entire process of metallurgical production, contributing to its energy and ecological efficiency.

The supra-molecular structure of a liquid is strongly connected to its dynamics, which in turn control macroscopic properties such as viscosity. Consequently, detailed knowledge about how this structure changes with temperature is essential to understand the thermal evolution of the dynamics ranging from the liquid to the glass. Here, we combine infrared spectroscopy (IR) measurements of the hydrogen (H) bond stretching vibration of water with molecular dynamics simulations and employ a quantitative analysis to extract the inter-molecular H-bond length in a wide temperature range of the liquid. The extracted expansivity of this H-bond differs strongly from that of the average nearest neighbor distance of oxygen atoms obtained through a common conversion of mass density. However, both properties can be connected through a simple model based on a random loose packing of spheres with a variable coordination number, which demonstrates the relevance of supra-molecular arrangement. Furthermore, the exclusion of the expansivity of the inter-molecular H-bonds reveals that the most compact molecular arrangement is formed in the range of ∼316-331K (i.e., above the density maximum) close to the temperature of several pressure-related anomalies, which indicates a characteristic point in the supra-molecular arrangement. These results confirm our earlier approach to deduce inter-molecular H-bond lengths via IR in polyalcohols [Gabriel et al. J. Chem. Phys. 154, 024503 (2021)] quantitatively and open a new alley to investigate the role of inter-molecular expansion as a precursor of molecular fluctuations on a bond-specific level.

Abstract The proliferation of microbial carbon fixation is a key control on the evolution of the biosphere and global carbon cycle. Most records of these metabolisms in ancient rocks come from organic matter or fossils, which are not always preserved. Here, we present a potential proxy for microbial carbon fixation (autotrophy) based on the isotopic composition of carbonate minerals. Autotrophs influence carbonate chemistry in the cellular microenvironment by decreasing CO 2 concentration and increasing the carbonate saturation state. This can induce rapid precipitation of carbonate minerals that are out of isotopic equilibrium with their environment. Recent work has identified disequilibrated dual clumped isotope compositions (∆ 47 and ∆ 48 ) in the skeletal fossils of marine calcifying organisms. Here we test whether the same is true of non‐skeletal carbonate fabrics associated with microbial autotrophs in modern and Eocene lakes. We found that microbial carbonate formed via autotrophic metabolism recorded lower ∆ 47 and higher ∆ 48 values (−∆ 47 /+∆ 48 ) than predicted for thermodynamic equilibrium mineral formation. Our findings are supported by models of dual clumped isotope kinetics in the DIC system, and disequilibrium in the oxygen isotope system. We hypothesize that the inverse trajectory away from the equilibrium line (+∆ 47 /−∆ 48 ) should be recorded by carbonates formed in association with alkalinizing heterotrophs, such as sulfate reducers. If so, carbonate dual clumped isotopes could be a powerful tool to identify the proliferation and rate of heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolisms in the carbonate rock record on Earth and (perhaps) other planets.

Abstract Gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ), with an ultrawide bandgap corresponding to the deep ultraviolet (DUV) range, has attracted significant attention in optical filter‐free photodetectors. In practical terms, DUV photodetectors employed in extreme conditions, for example, flame detection and space exploration, face the challenges of performance degradation caused by high/low‐temperature transformation. Here, DUV photodetectors are tailored with high durability and stability by one‐step‐grown β‐Ga 2 O 3 films via pulsed laser deposition. A high‐oxygen‐pressure scheme effectively addresses the issue of film‐free deposition at specifically high temperatures, facilitating the formation of polycrystalline high‐resistivity β‐Ga 2 O 3 films. As a result, the devices exhibit outstanding performance, including a low dark current (4.4 pA @30 V), high photoresponsivity (147.36 A W −1 ), and fast response time (3.1/22.6 ms). Additionally, the photoresponse performance shows minimal degradation at high temperatures up to 300 °C and even improves at low temperatures down to −100 °C, ranking it among the most robust DUV photodetectors. The mechanism of photoresponse, involving the exciton formation, bandgap evolution, carrier‐phonon scatter, etc., is also elucidated in a wide temperature range. This work provides an efficient solution for developing robust Ga 2 O 3 DUV photodetectors with excellent performance for extreme‐condition applications.

Plasma assisted combustion has been demonstrated to extend ignition limits and flame speeds in a variety of combustion environments. Its implementation addresses challenges such as stringent emission and efficiency requirements for power generation and propulsion, and flame holding and ignition in harsh flow environments during supersonic combustion. Plasma assisted combustion leverages the interaction of electric fields with ionized gases, to produce more reactive species, induce turbulence, or locally heat the flow. Timescales associated with plasma generation and high speed flows are short, often on the order of a few microseconds. This makes any experimental investigation of related phenomena inherently difficult. Additionally these short timescales limit the available time for intermolecular energy exchange. This can temporarily produce thermodynamic non-equilibrium, which may in turn affect the flow field and chemical reactions. In this dissertation, pulsed microwave plasmas are investigated in a variety of contexts: microwave plasmas are used to deposit electric field energy into sodium seeded detonation waves; the non-equilibrium created in microwave induced flame plasmas is investigated using high-speed laser diagnostics; and the interaction between laser induced ionization and the microwave field is leveraged for an improvement in molecular tagging velocimetry. The investigation of microwave detonation plasmas focuses on the role of ionization on microwave energy absorption. Alkali metals with low ionization energy thresholds are shown to increase free electron populations by up to 5 orders of magnitude, which increases the microwave energy absorption by a factor of 5 compared to unseeded detonations. The experimental results are shown to agree well with derived models for microwave absorption in high density, weakly ionized plasmas. The vibrational excitation and relaxation of oxygen and nitrogen in microwave flame plasmas with varying gas compositions are interrogated with several diagnostic techniques, including ultra-fast laser diagnostics and electric field measurements. Electron impact dissociation of oxygen and electronic excitation of nitrogen molecules are shown to significantly impact the evolution of the vibrational temperatures of either species. Long lived trace ionization from femtosecond laser pulses is shown to interact with pulsed microwave fields. This lays the foundation for a novel molecular tagging velocimetry technique: laser ionization tagging and emission re-excitation (LaITER). Emissions from LaITER can be measured by fast gated cameras to determine the displacement of tagged molecules and measure velocities. LaITER is demonstrated to improve signal levels, (up to 1000x) and signal lifetimes (up to ~10ms) in flows with varying gas compositions, at ambient and flame temperatures.

Nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films are attractive for many applications due to their smooth surfaces while holding the properties of diamond. However, their growth rate is generally low using common Ar/CH4 with or without H2 chemistry and strongly dependent on the overall growth conditions using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). In this work, incorporating a small amount of N2 and O2 additives into CH4/H2 chemistry offered a much higher growth rate of NCD films, which is promising for some applications. Several novel series of experiments were designed and conducted to tailor the growth features of NCD films by fine-tuning of the gas-phase compositions with different amounts of nitrogen and oxygen addition into CH4/H2 gas mixtures. The influence of growth parameters, such as the absolute amount and their relative ratios of O2 and N2 additives; substrate temperature, which was adjusted by two ways and inferred by simulation; and microwave power on NCD formation, was investigated. Short and long deposition runs were carried out to study surface structural evolution with time under identical growth conditions. The morphology, crystalline and optical quality, orientation, and texture of the NCD samples were characterized and analyzed. A variety of NCD films of high average growth rates ranging from 2.1 μm/h up to 6.7 μm/h were successfully achieved by slightly adjusting the O2/CH4 amounts from 6.25% to 18.75%, while that of N2 was kept constant. The results clearly show that the beneficial use of fine-tuning of gas-phase compositions offers a simple and effective way to tailor the growth characteristics and physical properties of NCD films for optimizing the growth conditions to envisage some specific applications.

The sedimentary environment is paramount in dictating depositional processes, ecological settings, and hydrodynamic conditions, all of which are pivotal to the aggregation of organic-rich sediments. A synergistic interplay is observed among the paleosedimentary environment, lithofacies, and enrichment of shale oil. Utilizing an analysis of elemental geochemistry and organic geochemical parameters─such as total organic carbon (TOC) content─this study endeavors to identify the predominant factors that govern the enrichment of organic matter (OM). It reconstructs the evolutionary trajectory of the paleosedimentary environment and introduces a dynamic model for shale oil enrichment within the Jurassic Lianggaoshan Formation of the Sichuan Basin. The results indicate that the Lianggaoshan Formation shale can be categorized into five lithological types, including high TOC felsic-rich shale (A), moderate TOC felsic-rich shale (B), moderate TOC felsic-rich mudstone (C), low TOC felsic-rich shale (D), and low TOC felsic-rich mudstone (E), and high TOC felsic-rich shale has the highest TOC and oil content. The shales of the Lianggaoshan Formation were deposited in an environment characterized by abundant terrestrial input, humid climate, freshwater conditions, reduced oxygen levels, and thriving primary productivity. OM enrichment is mainly controlled by the combination of a humid paleoclimate, high primary productivity, and other factors. The paleoenvironment deposited by lithofacies A coincides with the paleoenvironment conducive to OM enrichment, which makes lithofacies A become the dominant lithofacies for shale oil enrichment. Additionally, the sedimentary environment evolution characteristics and shale oil enrichment model of the Lianggaoshan Formation were established based on geochemical parameters. The paleosedimentary environment of the Lianggaoshan Formation from bottom to top is more and more unfavorable. The No.1 submember of the Lianggaoshan Formation is the most potential shale submember for shale oil exploration due to the paleosedimentary environment that promoted the deposition of lithofacies A and OM enrichment.

The growing interest in hybrid (aqueous–organic) electrolytes for electrochemical energy storage is due to their wide stability window, improved safety, and ease of assembly that does not require a moisture-free atmosphere. When it comes to applications in electrochemical capacitors, hybrid electrolytes are expected to fill the gap between high-voltage organic systems and their high discharge rate aqueous counterparts. This article discusses the potential applicability of aqueous–organic electrolytes utilizing water/N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solvent mixture, and sodium perchlorate as a source of charge carriers. The hydrogen bond formation between H2O and DMAc (mole fraction xDMAc = 0.16) is shown to regulate the original water and cation solvation structure, thus reducing the electrochemical activity of the primary aqueous solution both in the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions region. As a result, an electrochemical stability window of 3.0 V can be achieved on titanium electrodes while providing reasonable ionic conductivity of 39 mS cm−1 along with the electrolyte’s flame retardant and anti-freezing properties. Based on the diagnostic electrochemical studies, the operation conditions for carbon/carbon capacitors have been carefully optimized to adjust the potential ranges of the individual electrodes to the electrochemical stability region. The system with the appropriate electrode mass ratio (m+/m− = 1.51) was characterized by a wide operating voltage of 2.0 V, gravimetric energy of 13.2 Wh kg−1, and practically a 100% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles. This translates to a significant rise in the maximum energy of 76% when compared to the aqueous counterpart. Additionally, reasonable charge–discharge rates and anti-freeze properties of the developed electrolyte enable application in a broad temperature range down to −20 °C, which is demonstrated as well.

Abstract Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4 and 2.4 μ m with the high-resolution Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer on the Gemini-S telescope. We detected the presence of H 2 O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise ratios of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of       C + O   H      = −   0.70   − 0.93   + 1.27    , consistent with the stellar value, and a supersolar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O   =    0.80   − 0.11   + 0.07    . We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within 1 σ but favored a slightly more substellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio (       C + O   H      = −   0.74   − 0.17   + 0.23    and C/O   =    0.59   − 0.14   + 0.13    ). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ( V sys ) and Keplerian ( K p ) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted V sys for H 2 O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H 2 O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.

Cancers can manifest large variations in tumor phenotypes due to genetic and microenvironmental factors, which has motivated the development of quantitative radiomics-based image analysis with the aim to robustly classify tumor phenotypes in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be particularly helpful in elucidating the metabolic profiles of tumors. However, the relatively low resolution, high noise, and limited PET data availability make it difficult to study the relationship between the microenvironment properties and metabolic tumor phenotype as seen on the images. Most of previously proposed digital PET phantoms of tumors are static, have an over-simplified morphology, and lack the link to cellular biology that ultimately governs the tumor evolution. In this work, we propose a novel method to investigate the relationship between microscopic tumor parameters and PET image characteristics based on the computational simulation of tumor growth. We use a hybrid, multiscale, stochastic mathematical model of cellular metabolism and proliferation to generate simulated cross-sections of tumors in vascularized normal tissue on a microscopic level. The generated longitudinal tumor growth sequences are converted to PET images with realistic resolution and noise. By changing the biological parameters of the model, such as the blood vessel density and conditions for necrosis, distinct tumor phenotypes can be obtained. The simulated cellular maps were compared to real histology slides of SiHa and WiDr xenografts imaged with Hoechst 33342 and pimonidazole. As an example application of the proposed method, we simulated six tumor phenotypes that contain various amounts of hypoxic and necrotic regions induced by a lack of oxygen and glucose, including phenotypes that are distinct on the microscopic level but visually similar in PET images. We computed 22 standardized Haralick texture features for each phenotype, and identified the features that could best discriminate the phenotypes with varying image noise levels. We demonstrated that “cluster shade” and “difference entropy” are the most effective and noise-resilient features for microscopic phenotype discrimination. Longitudinal analysis of the simulated tumor growth showed that radiomics analysis can be beneficial even in small lesions with a diameter of 3.5–4 resolution units, corresponding to 8.7–10.0 mm in modern PET scanners. Certain radiomics features were shown to change non-monotonically with tumor growth, which has implications for feature selection for tracking disease progression and therapy response.

Abstract The Paleozoic Aktogai Group in Kazakhstan ranks among the thirty largest porphyry Cu deposits globally. The Aktogai deposit is the largest one in the Aktogai Group and is characterized by intensive potassic alteration where the dominant orebody occurred. However, its mineralization processes remain unclear. Our investigation focused on the texture, trace elements, fluid inclusions, and in-situ oxygen isotopes of the quartz from the ore-related tonalite porphyry and associated potassic alteration at Aktogai to trace the deposit’s mineralization processes. Ti-in-quartz thermobarometry, fluid inclusion microthermometry, and geological characteristics indicate that the ore-related magma at Aktogai originated from a shallow magma chamber at ~1.9±0.5 kbar (~7.2±1.9 km) and intruded as the tonalite porphyry stock at ~1.7-2.4 km. The potassic alteration and associated Cu mineralization comprise five types of veins (A1, A2, B1, B2, and C) and two types of altered rocks (biotite and K-feldspar). Among them, nine types of hydrothermal quartz were identified from early to late: (1) VQA1 in A1 veins and RQbt in biotite altered rocks, (2) VQA2 in A2 veins and RQkfs in K-feldspar altered rocks, (3) VQB1 in B1 veins and VQB2E in B2 veins, and (4) quartz associated with Cu-Fe sulfides (VQB2L, VQBC, and VQC) in B and C veins. Titanium contents of the quartz decreased, while Al/Ti ratios increased from early to late. Fluid inclusion microthermometry and mineral thermometers reveal that VQA1, RQbt, and hydrothermal biotite formed under high-temperature (~470-560 °C) and ductile conditions. VQA2, RQkfs, VQB1, and hydrothermal K-feldspar formed during the transition stage from ductile to brittle, with temperatures of ~350-540 °C. The rapid decrease in pressure from lithostatic to hydrostatic pressure led to fluid boiling and minor involvement of meteoric water (~11-14 %) in the mineralizing fluid. Extensive recrystallization in VQA1 to VQB1 was associated with repeated cleavage and healing of the intrusion. With cooling, K-feldspar decomposition and hydrolysis increased. Fluid cooling and water-rock reactions resulted in the co-precipitation of Cu-Fe sulfides, white mica, chlorite, VQBC, and VQC, with temperatures of ~275-370 °C and brittle conditions. The Paleozoic Aktogai deposit exhibits formation depths and fluid evolution processes similar to Mesozoic and Cenozoic PCDs worldwide. The close association between Cu-Fe sulfides and later quartz formed under intermediate-temperature conditions at Aktogai implies that Cu-Fe sulfides are not precipitated during early high-temperature conditions in porphyry Cu deposits.
