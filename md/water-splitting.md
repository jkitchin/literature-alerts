Iridium-based electrocatalysts are the most promising candidates for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Considering their high cost and scarcity, it is imperative to maximize atom utilization and enhance the intrinsic activity of iridium. In this work, IrOx sub-2 nm clusters are stabilized on TiO2 supports via metal support interaction (MSI) induced by vacancy defects in TiO2. The strength of MSI is readily tuned by the type of vacancies: oxygen vacancies in TiO2 (VO-TiO2) induce the adsorbed MSI with relatively weak strength, while titanium vacancies in TiO2 (VTi-TiO2) lead to the strong embedded MSI. The tunable MSI further modulates the electronic structure of IrOx sub-2 nm clusters. IrOx/VO-TiO2 with adsorbed MSI exhibits an optimized electronic structure with a downshifted d-band center of IrOx, resulting in a reduced binding energy with oxygen and a low energy barrier of the rate-determining step for OER. Consequently, IrOx/VO-TiO2 delivers an activity twice that of commercial IrO2 and a good stability for 120 h in a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Our study provides a guideline for the rational design of acidic OER catalysts based on modulating the electronic structure of IrOx sub-2 nm clusters via tunable MSI.

The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is severely limited by the poor stability, low activity, and high cost of available catalysts. Enhancing intrinsic activity while maintaining stability and reducing reliance on precious metals is crucial. The typical adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) leads to high overpotentials and low activity, making the transition to alternative mechanisms, such as the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) or oxide path mechanism (OPM), highly desirable due to their lower overpotentials. Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with experimental validation to enhance the activity and stability of β-MnO2 via co-substitution with ruthenium (Ru) and iridium (Ir), enabling the transition from AEM to OPM. DFT calculations reveal that AEM is hindered by the weak nucleophilicity of water, while LOM suffers from high kinetic barriers due to structural distortions. In contrast, OPM demonstrates a significantly lower kinetic barrier, facilitated by the synergistic interaction between Ru and Ir. Experimentally, IrRuMnOx was synthesized through co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, showing an 80-fold improvement in mass activity and a 96-fold increase in stability compared to commercial IrO2, with minimal noble metal leaching, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). IrRuMnOx exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 475 mV at 1 A·cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 44.26 mV·dec–1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, maintaining stable performance for over 100 h. Moreover, the IrRuMnOx-based membrane electrode, with a low Ir loading of 0.075 mgIr·cm–2, achieved remarkable current densities of 1.0 A·cm–2 at 1.66 V and 2.0 A·cm–2 at 1.91 V at 80 °C. This performance surpasses that of both unsupported and conventional supported Ir-based catalysts at comparable Ir loading levels. This study offers critical insights into OER mechanisms in acidic media and paves the way for developing efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.

Abstract Engineering nanomaterials at single‐atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO 2 ‐based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi‐RuO 2 single‐atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) RuBi single‐atom alloy. This Bi‐RuO 2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192 mV and superb stability over 650 h at 10 mA cm −2 , enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm −2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate‐evolving mechanism on Bi‐RuO 2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi 1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high‐performance electrocatalysts at atomic‐level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

Abstract Wide spread adaptation of green hydrogen can help to mitigate the serious climate issues, increasing global energy demands and the development of advanced electrocatalysts robust under industrial conditions is one of the key technological challenges. Herein, chromium‐doped nickel‐boride‐phosphide (Cr/NiBP) micro sphere (MS) electrocatalyst is demonstrated via a two‐step hydrothermal approach along with post‐annealing. The Cr/NiBP MS demonstrates low hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evaluation reaction over potentials of 78 and 250 mV at 100 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH, out performing most of the reported catalysts. The Cr/NiBP ǁ Cr/NiBP exhibits only 1.54 V at 100 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH and surpasses the benchmark of RuO 2 (+) ǁ Pt/C (−) up to 2000 mA cm −2 , which sets it as one of the best bifunctional electrocatalysts. Impressively, it maintains stable performance for over 240 h at 1000 mA cm −2 in 6 m KOH at 60°C, demonstrating rapid response, anti‐corrosion resistance, and robust structural integrity to meet the industrial operational conditions. Further, Cr/NiBP ǁ Pt/C exhibits a super‐low cell‐voltage of 2.25 V at 2000 mA cm −2 . The small amount of Cr atoms incorporation can significantly enhance active sites and intrinsic properties, accelerating water dissociation and rapid intermediate formation.

Abstract Integration of different active sites by heterostructure engineering is pivotal to optimize the intrinsic activities of an oxygen electrocatalyst and much needed to enhance the performance of rechargeable Zn–air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a biphasic nanoarchitecture encased in in situ grown N‐doped graphitic carbon (MnO/Co‐NGC) with heterointerfacial sites are constructed. The density functional theory model reveals formation of lattice oxygen bridged heterostructure with pyridinic nitrogen atoms anchored Co species, which facilitate adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Consequently, the well‐designed catalyst with accessible active sites, abundant oxygen vacant sites, and heterointerfacial coupling effects, simultaneously accelerate the electron/mass transfer and thus promotes the trifunctional electrocatalysis. The assembled aqueous ZAB delivers maximum power density of ≈268 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 797.8 mAh g zn −1 along with excellent rechargeability and extremely small voltage gap decay rate of 0.0007 V h −1 . Further, the fabricated quasisolid‐state ZAB owns a remarkable power density of 163 mW cm −2 and long cycle life, outperforming the benchmark air‐electrode and many recent reports, underlining its robustness and suitability for practical utilization in diverse portable applications.

Various sustainable energy conversion techniques like water electrolyzers, fuel cells, and metal-air battery devices are promising to alleviate the issues in fossil fuel consumption. However, their broad employment has been mainly inhibited by the lack of advanced electrocatalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the three involved half-reactions including oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent advances have witnessed the cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n])-directed strategy as a prominent tool to develop high performance electrocatalysts with either OER, ORR, or HER activities. In this review, the recent progress on CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts ranging from molecular complexes to heterogeneous nanostructures and single-atoms for the three half-reactions are reviewed, and future opportunities are discussed. A concise introduction to the fundamentals of CB[n]s regarding their synthesis, structure, and chemistry is given first. Subsequently, the systematic summary of CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts and their performance for the OER/ORR/HER are discussed in detail, with a specific emphasis on correlating their structure and activities by combining diverse physiochemical characterizations, electrochemical experiments, and theory simulations. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspective for future opportunities regarding CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts for many other electrocatalytic applications are proposed.

Abstract Designing cost‐effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge in green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two OWS half‐cell reactions. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesiz hierarchical heterostructure MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH and MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low IR‐corrected overpotentials of 156 and 61 mV with at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 under light assistance. The MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH‐MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH OWS cell achieves a low cell voltage of 1.46V at 10 mA cm −2 during light‐assisted water electrolysis. Both materials exhibited exceptional stability under industrially relevant HER and OER conditions, maintaining a current density of 1 A cm −2 with minimal alterations in their potential and performance. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping the LDH matrix with high‐valence Mo atoms and MoS 2 quantum dots improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the electrocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the thermodynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, this work develops a facile synthesis method to design highly active and stable MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.

An ideal water-splitting electrocatalyst is inexpensive, abundant, highly active, stable, selective, and durable. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the main bottleneck for H2 production with a complex and not fully resolved mechanism, slow kinetics, and high overpotential. Nickel oxide-based catalysts (NiOx) are highly active and cheaper than precious metal catalysts. However, rigorous catalyst tests and DFT calculations are still needed to rationally optimize NiOx catalysts. In this work, we combine plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) and density functional theory (DFT) to address the role of dopants in promoting NiOx OER activity. Ultrathin films of NiOx doped with Zn2+, Al3+, and Sn4+ presented improved intrinsic activity, stability, and durability for the OER. The results show a low to high catalytic performance of ZnNiOx < NiOx < AlNiOx < SnNiOx, which we attribute to an increase in the concentration of valence band (VB) holes combined with conduction band (CB) electron conductivity, characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of doping on the electronic structure and catalytic activity was investigated using advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (PEB0/pob-TZVP). DFT complements the experimental results, showing that the dopant charge states and orbital hybridization enhance the OER by improving the charge carrier concentration and mobility, thus allowing optimal binding energies and charge dynamics and delocalization. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PE-ALD-doped nanofilms NiOx and DFT to rationally design and develop catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves the recombination of diamagnetic hydroxyl (OH) or water (H 2 O) into the paramagnetic triplet state of oxygen (O 2 ). The spin conservation of oxygen intermediates plays a crucial role in OER, however, research on spin dynamics during the catalytic process remains in its early stages. Herein, β ‐Ni(OH) 2 and Fe‐doped β ‐Ni(OH) 2 (Ni 5 Fe 1 (OH) 2 ) are utilized as model catalysts to understand the mechanism of spin magnetic effects at iron (III) sites during OER. Combined with magnetic characterization, it is founded that the introduction of Fe transforms the antiferromagnetic Ni(OH) 2 into a ferromagnetic material. Testing the magnetic response of the catalyst under an external magnetic field, the OER activity of Ni 5 Fe 1 (OH) 2 is significantly enhanced in comparison to Ni(OH) 2 . This improvement is likely due to the introduction of iron sites, which promote spin magnetic effects and enhance reaction kinetics, thereby increasing catalytic efficiency. Combining experimental and theoretical characterization, it is discovered that the iron sites accelerate the formation of heterogeneous dual‐site O─O bridging, represented as ─Ni─O─O─Fe─, thereby effectively enhancing the kinetics of the OER reaction. This study provides a magnetic perspective on the structure‐function relationship of magnetic iron‐based catalysts and has significant implications for the design of new catalysts.

Abstract Nickel‐based double perovskites AA′BB′O 6 are an underexplored class of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, in which B‐site substitution is used to tune electronic and structural properties. BaSrNiWO 6 , with a B‐site comprised of alternating Ni and W, exhibits high oxygen evolution activity, attributed to the evolution of a highly OER active surface phase. The redox transformation of Ni 2+ (3d 8 ) to Ni 3+ (3d 7 ) combined with partial W dissolution into the electrolyte from the linear Ni(3d)‐O(2p)‐W(5d) chains drives an in situ reconstruction of the surface to an amorphized, NiO‐like layer, promoting oxygen redox in the OER mechanism. However, the high valence W 6+ (5d 0 ) acts as a stabilizing electronic influence in the bulk, preventing the mobilization of lattice oxygen which is bound in highly covalent W─O bonds. It is proposed that the surface generated during the OER can support a lattice oxygen evolution mechanism (LOEM) in which oxygen vacancies are created and preferentially refilled by electrolytic OH − , while bulk O species remain stable. This surface LOEM (sLOEM) allows BaSrNiWO 6 to retain structural integrity during OER catalysis. With a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec −1 in 0.1 m KOH, BaSrNiWO 6 illustrates the potential of Ni‐based double perovskites to offer both OER efficiency and bulk stability in alkaline electrolysis.

Abstract The preparation and modification of porous electrodes are an important component of the new generation electrochemical oxidation technology. Rapid preparation of porous electrodes can be easily achieved by synchronous oxygen bubble electrodeposition. However, according to the reaction mechanism of lead dioxide anodic electrodeposition, there is bound to be a competitive reaction of adsorbed hydroxyl radicals in the oxygen bubble template method, which means that synchronous OER impacts both the surface morphology and potentially the crystalline structure of the metal oxides. Clarifying the comprehensive influence of synchronous OER on the morphology and microstructure of the coating is important. In this work, the electrodeposition process of porous lead dioxide coating is regulated by the way of linear potential increase and realized the rapid preparation of high‐performance porous lead dioxide coating within 40 s. The morphology and microstructure, electrical, and electrochemical properties are characterized, combined with theoretical calculation and orthogonal analysis, to investigate the regulatory mechanism of the rapid growth of the porous lead dioxide by the electric potential. It is demonstrated that synchronous OER confers porous morphology and a large number of defects to the coating in situ, and enhancing the electrocatalytic oxidation performance of the electrode.

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) toward 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has been considered a promising approach for the substitution of the energy-consuming and hazardous oxygen evolution reaction and for the valorization of renewable biomass. However, it is limited by the susceptibility of HMF to the oxidative environment and requires efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a NiMo complex (NiMo-N) is provided as the precatalyst for the HMFOR, exhibiting favorable performances with a current density of 450 mA·cm-2 achieved at an anodic potential of 1.4 V vs RHE (similarly hereinafter) with 50 mmol/L (mM) HMF and over 95% HMF conversion and FDCA FE for at least five cycles. Combined with quasi situ and in situ analysis, it is confirmed that the extensive lattice distortions in the precatalyst facilitate the in-depth reconstruction, increasing the accessible Ni sites and defective oxygen vacancies (Ov), which would promptly convert to high-valence Ni and active O species during the reaction. The improved performance is then attributed to the incorporation of the improved chemisorption and dehydrogenation ability of HMF by the as-evolved active sites.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical half-reaction in water splitting and metal–air cells. The sensitivity of the OER to the composition and structure of the electrocatalyst presents a significant challenge in elucidating the structure–property relationship. In this study, highly stable single-crystal cobalt carbonate hydroxide [Co2(OH)2CO3, CoCH] was used as a model to investigate the correlations among structure, composition, and reactivity. Single-crystal CoCH nanowires (denoted as CoCH NWs) and Fe-doped CoCH nanowires (denoted as Fe-CoCH NWs) with an exposed (210) facet and Fe-doped CoCH nanosheets (denoted as Fe-CoCH NSs) with an exposed (2–13) facet were synthesized using electrochemical and one-step hydrothermal strategies, respectively. Their OER activity decreased in the following order: Fe-CoCH NWs > Fe-CoCH NSs > CoCH NWs. Theoretical investigation suggested that the doped Fe sites serve as active sites, and the crystal-facet dependence can finely adjust the 3d configuration of Fe sites, resulting in the optimal adsorption strengths and energy barriers for potential-determining steps on the (210) facet of CoCH. This renders the as-prepared Fe-CoCH NWs as some of the most promising Co-based OER catalysts.

Fe2B is a potentially promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its excellent electronic conductivity, which is superior to that of traditional oxide catalysts. However, the activity of Fe2B is still not satisfactory. In this study, meta-stable microstructure stacking faults (SFs) were incorporated into Fe2B through a one-step high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) method. Pressure suppressed atomic diffusion but formed SFs when the grain grew. Fe2B with SFs exhibited remarkable OER activity, with low overpotential values of only 269 and 344 mV required to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively; because of the presence of SFs, the overpotential for the OER was reduced to only 67.7% of that of Fe2B without SFs at 10 mA cm−2. Theoretical and experimental investigations confirmed that these SFs regulate the d-band center of Fe2B toward the Fermi level, optimizing the catalytic site activity. Furthermore, SFs reduced the charge transfer between Fe atoms and boron (B) atoms, increasing the number of free electrons in the structure and thereby increasing conductivity. Finally, this study suggests a strategy to construct microstructures in crystals, providing new insights into designing excellent catalysts via microstructure engineering.

Bimetallic oxides are promising electrocatalysts due to their rich composition, facile synthesis, and favorable stability under oxidizing conditions. This paper innovatively proposes a strategy aimed at constructing a one‐dimensional heterostructure (Fe–NiO/NiMoO 4 nanoparticles/nanofibers). The strategy commences with the meticulous treatment of NiMoO 4 nanofibers, utilizing in situ etching techniques to induce the formation of Prussian Blue Analog compounds. In this process, [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3− anions react with the NiMoO 4 host layer to form a steady NiFe PBA. Subsequently, the surface/interface reconstituted NiMoO 4 nanofibers undergo direct oxidation, leading to a reconfiguration of the surface structure and the formation of a unique Fe–NiO/NiMoO 4 one‐dimensional heterostructure. The catalyst showed markedly enhanced electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory results reveal that the incorporation of Fe as a dopant dramatically reduces the Gibbs free energy associated with the rate‐determining step in the oxygen evolution reaction pathway. This pivotal transformation directly lowers the activation energy barrier, thereby significantly enhancing electron transfer efficiency.

Heterogenous single-atom catalysts (SACs) are reminiscent of homogeneous catalysts because of the similarity of structural motif of active sites, showing the potential of using the advantage of homogeneous catalysts to tackle challenges in hetereogenous catalysis. In heterogeneous oxygen electrocatalysis, the homogeneity of adsorption patterns of reaction intermediates leads to scaling relationships that limit their activities. In contrast, homogeneous catalysts can circumvent such limits by selectively altering the adsorption of intermediates through secondary coordination effects (SCEs). This inspired us to explore potential SCEs in metal–nitrogen-carbon (M–N-C), a promising type of oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. We introduced SCEs with a neighboring metal site that can modulate the adsorption strengths of oxygen-containing intermediates. First-principles calculations show that the second site in the heteronuclear duo four-nitrogen-coordinated metal center can induce SCEs that selectively stabilize the OOH intermediate but with minor effects on the OH intermediate and, thereby, disrupt the scaling relation between oxygen species and eventually increase the catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reactions. Additionally, the activity of oxygen reduction reaction of selected M–N-C is also enhanced by such SCE. Our computational work underscored the critical role SCEs can have in shaping activities of SACs, particularly in favorably altering scaling relationships, and demonstrated its potential to address catalytic challenges in heterogeneous catalysis.

Exploring a general method for constructing uniform heterostructures with sub-5 nm crystallites and dense interfaces is crucial yet challenging for advancing water electrocatalysis. Herein, a bottom-up cocrystallization strategy, involving in situ transformation of amorphous Ni–P through gas–solid reactions, is proposed to synthesize a series of nickel-based heterojunctions on carbon cloth (CC). Thereinto, interface-wealthy NiS2-Ni2P/CC with densely packed 3–4 nm crystallites demonstrates superb catalytic performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The electrolyzer merely requires cell voltages of 1.79 and 1.89 V to propel overall water splitting currents of 200 and 400 mA cm–2, respectively, outperforming the vast majority of reported nickel-based heterojunctions. Theoretical calculations reveal that charge redistribution and electronic structure modulation optimize the hydrogen and oxygen evolution pathways at the NiS2 and Ni2P sides of the interfaces, respectively. Moreover, uniform hybridization with densely distributed heterointerfaces offers abundant active sites for electrocatalysis, pioneering an extendable approach for constructing advanced heterojunction catalysts for green hydrogen production.

Abstract Ni‐rich cathodes are more promising candidates to the increasing demand for high capacity and the ability to operate at high voltages. However, the high Ni content creates a trade‐off between energy density and cycling stability, mainly caused by the chemo‐mechanical degradation. Oxygen evolution, cation mixing, rock salt formation, phase transition, and crack formation contribute to the degradation process. To overcome this problem, strategies such as doping, surface coating, and core‐shell structures have been employed. The advantage of doping is to engineer the cathode surface, structure, and particle morphology simultaneously. This review aims to summarize recent advances in understanding chemo‐mechanical degradation mechanism and the role of different dopants in enhancing the thermal stability and overall electrochemical performance. The pinning and pillaring effects of dopants on suppressing oxygen evolution, cation mixing, and phase transition are introduced. It is found that the higher ionic radii enable dopants to reside on cathode particles, preserving the particle surface and refining particle morphology to suppress crack formation. Finally, the effect of doping on Li ion diffusion, rate capability, and long‐term stability are discussed.

Abstract The development of noble‐metal free electrocatalysts with low production cost is of utmost importance for sustainable water electrolysis. Herein, we present a fast flexible synthesis pathway for the preparation of a variety of different medium‐ and high‐entropy spinel sulfides of various compositions, using a non‐aqueous microwave‐assisted synthesis without any H 2 S. Nanoparticulate high‐entropy sulfides containing up to 8 different metal cations can be obtained after an extremely short synthesis time of only 1 min and comparatively low temperatures of 200–230°C. We further demonstrate the high activity of the obtained sulfides for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

The space charge effect induced by high-quality heterojunctions is essential for efficient electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we delicately manipulate intermolecular charge transfer by modifying substituents (-g = -CH3, -H, -NO2) with various electron donating/withdrawing capabilities in CoPc-g/CoS organic-inorganic heterostructures. CoPc-CH3, as a typical electron donor, transfers more electrons to CoS due to the presence of -CH3, forming the strongest space electric field and thus regulating the dual active sites at the interface. Furthermore, oxygen-containing intermediates preferentially adsorb on the positively charged CoPc-CH3 side, and the rapid accumulation of electrons on the CoS side decelerates catalyst dissolution at the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential, ensuring the stable OER process under the optimized adsorbate evolution mechanism. As a result, CoPc-CH3/CoS catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential and remains stable for 150 h at 0.5 A cm-2 in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The method provides a novel strategy for accurately regulating the space electric field of heterojunctions.

The incorporation of non-metal dopants can significantly enhance catalytic activity and improve stability. Furthermore, the creation of heterostructures is particularly advantageous to facilitate charge transfer and optimize electronic properties. This study presents an effective bifunctional mixed-valence Ruthenium heterostructure synthesized through a cascading process involving grinding with carbon nitride and subsequent thermal treatment. The catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance with remarkably low overpotentials of 197 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 24.8 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, with the stability exceeding 24 h at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻2 in acidic media. Additionally, when employed in an acidic oxygen water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer, the bifunctional catalyst demonstrates excellent activity, achieving an ultralow cell voltage of 1.53 V to sustain 10 mA cm⁻2. Enhanced performance is attributed to efficient charge transfer and increased exposure of active sites, providing valuable insights for the development of effective acidic water-electrolysis catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) to ammonia presents a promising alternative strategy to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. However, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reduces the Faradaic efficiency toward ammonia, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) increases the energy consumption. This study designs IrCu4 alloy nanoparticles as a bifunctional catalyst to achieve efficient NO3RR and OER while suppressing the unwanted HER. This is achieved by operating the NO3RR at positive potentials using the IrCu4 catalyst, which allows a Faradaic efficiency of 93.6% for NO3RR. When applied to OER catalysis, the IrCu4 alloy also shows excellent results, with a relatively low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Stable ammonia production can be achieved for 50 h in a 16 cm2 flow electrolyzer in simulated working conditions. Our research provides a pathway for optimizing NO3RR through bifunctional catalysts in a tandem approach.

In the realm of green hydrogen energy, utilizing ruthenium (Ru) as a precious metal electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) instead of platinum (Pt/C) is an excellent choice. Unfortunately, there are not enough active sites or electronic structures on a single Ru-based catalyst to significantly improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, creating bifunctional water electrolysis catalysts that are stable and highly active in a variety of media continues to be a major challenge. The study describes a new method for creating an electrocatalyst (RuCuCl/NF-2) by using Ru to regulate an inert CuCl precursor. The enhanced mass transfer performance of the distinctive coral structure and the synergistic effect of RuCu emphasize its excellent water electrolysis activity, which is based on the self-assembly of Cu nanoparticles into a conical membrane structure. Overtaking the commercial benchmark Pt/C (~38 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2), the RuCuCl/NF-2 displays HER activity (~25 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2) in 1M KOH. This sheds light on how to create more sophisticated bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Dye-sensitization is a promising strategy to improve the light absorption and photoactivity abilities of wide-bandgap semiconductors, like TiO2. For effective water-splitting photoanodes with no sacrificial agents, the electrochemical potential of the dye must exceed the thermodynamic threshold needed for the oxygen evolution reaction. This study investigates two promising organic cyanoacrylic dyes, designed to meet that criterion by means of theoretical calculations. Both yellow-colored dyes were synthesized and characterized by optical and photoelectrochemical techniques, demonstrating strong light absorption in the visible region, suitable experimental reduction potentials, and adsorption from the organic solvent onto mesoporous TiO2 layers. In addition, to promote immobilization in aqueous electrolytes, the dyes were hybridized with graphene oxide or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Photoelectrochemical analysis of the dye-sensitized photoelectrodes demonstrated efficient charge transfer from the dyes to the TiO2 photoanode under simulated solar light. While the starting photocurrent notably surpassed the blank TiO2, a subsequent decay points to kinetic obstacles that still need to be overcome.

Seawater electrolysis is an ideal technology for obtaining clean energy—green hydrogen. Developing efficient bifunctional catalysts is crucial for hydrogen production through direct seawater electrolysis. Currently, metal substrates loaded with active catalysts are widely employed as electrodes for seawater electrolysis. However, the challenge of metal corrosion cannot be ignored. In this work, the boron-doped diamond (BDD) with excellent corrosion resistance was explored as a substrate for loading active catalysts in seawater electrolysis. A step-by-step electrodeposition method was used to fabricate the FeCoS/Ni/BDD electrode, effectively addressing the poor adhesion of the FeCoS active layer to the BDD substrate. The resulting electrode demonstrated interesting bifunctional catalytic performance, achieving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials of 425 mV and 360 mV, respectively, in alkaline simulated seawater (1 M KOH and 3.5 wt% NaCl) at a current density of 100 mA cm− 2. Furthermore, by increasing the KOH concentration in the alkaline simulated seawater to 3 M, the OER and HER overpotentials of the electrode significantly decreased to 383 and 300 mV, respectively. This work offers a novel approach for utilizing BDD substrates in the design of corrosion-resistant electrodes for alkaline seawater electrolysis.

Rechargeable Zn-air batteries (RZABs) are poised for industrial application, yet they require low-cost, high-performance catalysts that efficiently facilitate both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The pivotal challenge lies in designing multimetal active sites and optimizing the carbon skeleton structure to modulate catalyst activity. In this study, we introduce a novel hierarchical porous carbon-supported FeCoNi bifunctional catalyst, synthesized via a spray combustion method. The carbon, derived from sucrose, was tailored into a hierarchical porous morphology through etching with NO3- ions and NaCl, thereby significantly increasing the surface area for the interaction of the O2 and electrolyte interaction. The in situ formation of FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles ensures their uniform dispersion and anchoring, facilitating electron transport. The strong interaction and charge transfer at the heterogeneous FeCoNi alloy interfaces, along with nitrogen doping, which enhances the OER/ORR activity, endow the FeCoNi/N-PC catalyst with exceptional bifunctional catalytic properties, characterized by an activity parameter of 0.73 V. Furthermore, the RZAB assembled with this catalyst demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and reversibility, with a minimal round-trip efficiency decay of 7.6% over 1380 cycles (460 h) at 10 mA cm-2.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials present novel electronic and catalytic performances, showing a promising application as nano-device. In this investigation, a family of 2D material, X 2 B 6 (X = K, Na and Rb), is predicted with puckered crystal structure by elemental mutation method. The dynamic and thermal stability of the X 2 B 6 monolayer is addressed. The anisotropic mechanical properties of the X 2 B 6 monolayer is obtained by the Young’s modulus (296–406 N/m) and the Poisson’s ratio (0.36–0.35). Interestingly, the K 2 B 6 and Rb 2 B 6 monolayers demonstrate a metallic band structure, while the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is a semiconductor with an ultra-narrow bandgap only about 0.42 eV. Then, the ultra-high electron mobility in the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is calculated as about 9942 cm 2 .V −1 .s −1 , and the excellent optical performance of the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is also addressed. More importantly, the advantageous catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reduction (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is explored in these X 2 B 6 monolayers. Our work suggests a theoretical guidance to use the X 2 B 6 monolayer as a high-speed electronic devices and highly efficient catalyst.

The 90-year-old Hume–Rothery rule was adapted to design an outstanding bifunctional tetra-metallic alloy electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. Following the radius mismatch principles, Fe (131 pm) and Ni (124 pm) are selectively incorporated at the Pd (139 pm) site of Mo0.30Pd0.70 nanosheets. Analogously, Cu (132 pm) alloys with only Pd, while Ag (145 pm) alloys with both Pd and Mo (154 pm). The face-centered cubic Mo0.30Pd0.35Ni0.23Fe0.12 nanosheets with 10–12 atomic layers, featuring in-plane compressive strain along the {111} basal plane, show 1/3 (422) reflection from local hexagonal symmetry. The more electronegative Pd attracts electron density from Ni/Fe in Mo0.30Pd0.35Ni0.23Fe0.12, synergistically boosting the mass activities for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to 89 ± 5 and 38.6 ± 3.1 A g–1 at ±400 mV versus RHE, respectively. Full water electrolysis continues for ≥550 h, requiring cell voltages of 1.51 and 1.63 V at 10 and 100 mA cm–2, delivering 45 mL h–1 green H2.

Abstract The idea of grid‐scale hydrogen production by water electrolysis has been made possible by developing catalyst‐anchored three‐dimensional (3D) foam‐based electrodes. Catalytic performance in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions is improved by incorporating catalyst in 3D interlinked porous architecture, which enhances electrical conductivity and speeds up the discharge of gas bubbles. The detailed study on the role‐play of 3D frameworks in energy generation is explained in this article. The review also focuses on the recent development in utilizing these 3D substrates in the field of electrochemistry. Furthermore, it is imperative to enhance their compatibility with renewable energy systems and high‐temperature electrolysis for the sustainable production of hydrogen. Therefore, this review briefly explores the innovative design of self‐supported 3D framework electrodes using heterostructures and doping techniques to develop stable, durable, and efficient electrocatalysts. These catalysts aim to provide near‐zero overpotential, high selectivity, and long‐term stability for hydrogen production through water electrolysis, paving the way for commercial‐scale green energy production. 3D foam‐based electrodes can emerge as a key technology in the field of electrochemistry.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials with multifunctional properties, such as negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), magnetism, catalysis, and energy storage capabilities, are of significant interest for advanced applications in flexible electronics, spintronics, catalysis, and lithium-ion batteries. However, the discovery of such materials, particularly in low-dimensional forms, remains a challenge. In this study, we perform high-throughput density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore a new class of 2D V-shaped monolayers with remarkable physicochemical properties. Among 18 stable $M_4X_8$ (M = transition metal; X = halogen) compounds, we identify 9 auxetic monolayers, with \ce{Pd4I8} standing out for its exceptionally high NPR of -0.798. Notably, 4 of these materials exhibit half semiconductor properties, while 5 others are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, offering a unique combination of electronic and magnetic behavior. Additionally, these materials demonstrate promising catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) and show potential as anodes for rechargeable metal-ion batteries, particularly in alkali-ion systems. This work not only expands the family of 2D NPR materials but also introduces new candidates with multifunctional capabilities for a wide range of applications in nanoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage.

Abstract Alloying atomically dispersed noble metals with earth‐abundant transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) presents a promising approach to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, the challenge remains of reducing the size of the NPs without sacrificing high activity and durability. In this study, Ru–Co 2 Ni nanoalloy particles (NAPs) encapsulated in nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) are introduced, forming a core‐shell electrocatalyst (Ru–Co 2 Ni@NCNT). This design leverages Ru site optimization, CNT density control, strain engineering, efficient water dissociation, and outstanding bubble release dynamics within the core‐shell structure. These factors significantly improve catalytic performance with low overpotentials of 35 and 57 mV overpotential in 1.0 m KOH and 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 solutions, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that while Ru sites serve as active sites, they also modify the electronic structure of Co and Ni, optimizing their hydrogen adsorption energies and improving HER efficiency. The Ru–Co 2 Ni@NCNT catalyst is successfully integrated into both anion exchange membrane (AEM) and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, demonstrating stable operation at 0.5 A cm −2 for 500 h, underscoring its potential for efficient and durable hydrogen production.

Experimental observations from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption analysis suggest that C@CNT[Ni] outperforms C@CNT[Cu] in the ORR and OER, which is further supported by density functional theory calculations. C@CNT[Ni] exhibits a higher onset potential (0.99 V vs RHE) and a smaller Tafel slope (40.2 mV decade–1) compared to those of C@CNT/[Cu] in an alkaline electrolyte (0.94 V vs RHE and 46.5 mV decade–1, respectively). Such circumstances are attributed to the alloying effect between Ni and Fe in C@CNT[Ni], in contrast to the existing copper iron oxide phase in C@CNT/[Cu]. It is noteworthy that C@CNT[Ni] also displayed an improved OER, demanding its bifunctional property. As a proof of concept, C@CNT[Ni] was utilized in zinc–air batteries, which shows a high energy efficiency of ∼60%, a small charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.78 V, and excellent cycling performance (∼120 h) at 5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C. This protocol expands the utility of novel metal–organic hyper-cross-linked polymer-derived bimetallic electrocatalysts for clean energy research.

Abstract Perovskite‐type oxides having composition La x Sm 0.8− x Sr 0.2 NiO 3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) were explored for their ability to act as facilitators for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Synthesis of the materials was conducted through a sol‐gel procedure via malic acid. The materials underwent advanced physicochemical characterization utilizing techniques, namely transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) and X‐ray diffraction (XRD). These analyses provided crucial details about the material’s particle size, surface morphology/chemical composition and crystalline structure, opening up exciting possibilities for their diverse applications. From TEM analysis, the average particle size of the oxide materials has been estimated and found to be 5.9 nm for Sm 0.8 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 and 4.8 nm for La 0.6 Sm 0.2 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 . The particle size of the oxide material decreases when La was partially substituted for Sm in Sm 0.8 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 . Cyclic voltammetry and Tafel plot were observed for the electrochemical analysis in 1 M KOH (25 °C). An investigation on the anodic polarization of oxides revealed an increased electrocatalytic activity when La was partially substituted for Sm in Sm 0.8 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 . La 0.6 Sm 0.2 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 was found to be most active at 800 mV with a current density, j = 184.1 mA/cm 2 . The Tafel experiment was conducted in 1M KOH at varying temperatures to determine thermodynamic properties like standard electrochemical energy of activation (), standard enthalpy of activation (Δ H ° # ), and standard entropy of activation (Δ S ° # ).

Recent ground- and space-based surveys have shown that planets between Earth and Neptune in size, known as "super-Earths," are among the most frequently found planets in the Galaxy. Although the JWST era has provided high-quality atmospheric data on several such super-Earths, modeling tools are crucial for understanding their unobservable interiors. Consequently, interior studies represent the next essential step in gaining a comprehensive understanding of this class of exoplanets. This study investigates the interior structure, thermal evolution, and atmospheric dynamics of the super-Earth GJ 486b using SERPINT, a 1-D self-consistent coupled interior structure and evolution model, aiming to understand the planet's thermal evolution based on an Earth-like structure. Our results indicate that GJ 486b's core is approximately 1.34 times larger than Earth's, with a core pressure of about 1171 GPa. The thermal evolution model predicts that the planet's mantle cools and solidifies over approximately 0.93 million years. As the magma ocean cools, water is released from the melt, forming a water-rich atmosphere during early solidification. Photolysis of water vapor and subsequent hydrogen escape lead to oxygen accumulation, forming a water- and oxygen-rich secondary atmosphere. Future high-sensitivity JWST observations, with improved wavelength coverage and the detection of additional trace gases, will enable a detailed analysis of the planet's atmospheric composition, providing crucial insights into the interior, surface, and subsurface properties of GJ 486b.

Global oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) often reach hypoxia but seldom reach anoxia. Recently it was reported that Michaelis Menten constants (Km) of oxidative enzymes are orders of magnitude higher than respiratory Km values, and in the Hypoxic Barrier Hypothesis it was proposed that, in ecosystems experiencing falling oxygen, oxygenase enzyme activities become oxygen-limited long before respiration. We conducted a mesocosm experiment with a phytoplankton bloom as an organic carbon source and controlled dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the dark to determine whether hypoxia slows carbon oxidation and oxygen decline. Total oxygen utilization (TOU) in hypoxic treatment (ca. 7.1 µM O2) was 21.7% lower than the oxic treatment (ca. 245.1 µM O2) over the first 43 days of the experiment. In addition, following the restoration of fully oxic conditions to the hypoxic treatment, TOU accelerated, demonstrating that oxidative processes are sensitive to DO concentrations found in large volumes of the ocean. Microbial amplicon-based community composition diverged between oxic treatments, indicating a specialized microbiome that included Thioglobaceae (SUP05 Gammaproteobacteria), OM190 (Planctomycetota), ABY1 (Patescibacteria), and SAR86 subclade D2472, thrived in the hypoxic treatment, while the genus Candidatus Actinomarina and SAR11 alphaproteobacteria were sharply inhibited. Our findings support the hypothesis that oxygenase kinetics might slow the progression of ocean deoxygenation in oxygen-poor regions and be a factor in the evolution of microbial taxa adapted to hypoxic environments.

Dual-atom catalysts featuring synergetic dinuclear active sites, have the potential of breaking the linear scaling relationship of the well-established single-atom catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction; however, the design of dual-atom catalysts with rationalized local microenvironment for high activity and selectivity remains a great challenge. Here we design a bisalphen ladder polymer with well-defined densely populated binuclear cobalt sites on Ketjenblack substrates. The strong electron coupling effect between the fully-conjugated ladder structure and carbon substrates enhances the electron transfer between the cobalt center and oxygen intermediates, inducing the low-to-high spin transition for the 3d electron of Co(II). In situ techniques and theoretical calculations reveal the dynamic evolution of Co2N4O2 active sites and reaction intermediates. In alkaline conditions, the catalyst exhibits impressive oxygen reduction reaction activity featuring an onset potential of 1.10 V and a half-wave potential of 1.00 V, insignificant decay after 30,000 cycles, pushing the overpotential boundaries of ORR electrocatalysis to a low level. This work provides a platform for designing efficient dual-atom catalysts with well-defined coordination and electronic structures in energy conversion technologies. Designing dual-atom catalysts with high activity and selectivity for oxygen reduction reactions is a challenging task. Here, the authors report a bisalphen ladder polymer with densely populated binuclear cobalt sites on Ketjenblack substrates, which improves oxygen reduction performance and stability.

Abstract Over the last decade, there has been significant advances in our understanding of anaerobic hydrocarbon oxidation in Archaea. While Bacteria are known to oxidise hydrocarbons aerobically, no aerobic hydrocarbon oxidation pathway has been found in Archaea. Here, we report the first aerobic hydrocarbon oxidizing archaeon in a novel order of the Syntropharchaeia. This order is represented by six metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) spanning three genera that are found in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Our analysis revealed that MAGs belonging to one newly defined genus, Candidatus ‘Aerovita’, encode a bacterial copper monooxygenase complex with homology to bacterial hydrocarbon monooxygenases. The presence of other oxygen-dependent enzymes, such as haem-copper oxygen reductase, and the absence of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, indicate an aerobic lifestyle for the Ca. ‘Aerovita’ lineage. These findings support horizontal gene transfer between archaeal and bacterial domains facilitating the evolution of aerobic hydrocarbon-oxidizing archaea.

The present study focuses on electrical stimulation for composting. Using the PSALSAR method, a systematic review resulted in 24 relevant articles. For each system, the review describes key materials, composter design, operating conditions, temperature evolution, compost maturity, microbial community, and outcome. The examined studies fall into four main systems: electric field-assisted aerobic composting (EAAC), electrolytic oxygen aerobic composting (EOAC), microbial fuel cells (MFC), and thermoelectric generators (TEG). Apart from the main systems highlighted above, there is a rare case, which remains hardly studied. This includes bioelectrochemically assisted anaerobic composting (AnCBE, III). EAAC and EOAC systems biologically balance microbial activity and organic matter decomposition, whereas MFC and TEG systems have dual functioning due to energy generated alongside waste degradation. These innovative systems significantly improve composting efficiency by speeding up organic matter breakdown, increasing oxygen supply, and facilitating energy recovery. Together, they overcome the drawbacks of conventional composting systems and promote more environmentally friendly waste management solutions.

Avascular necrosis (AVN) is characterized by compromised blood supply to bone tissue, often resulting in significant pain and functional impairment. Conservative treatment options for early-stage AVN of the talus are scarce, with non-weight-bearing protocols and hyperbaric oxygen therapy showing limited efficacy. This report presents a potential novel approach to managing non-traumatic AVN of the talus using a combination of adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). A 60-year-old male presented with progressive right ankle pain of a two-year evolution. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed stage II AVN of the talus with extensive bone infarctions occupying almost all of its volume but with no collapse. A single injection of SVF and PRP was performed after diagnostic arthroscopy, followed by a tailored rehabilitation protocol. The patient experienced significant pain relief, with no further need for analgesics, and was able to return to non-impact sports. At the 18-month follow-up, functional scores showed significant improvement, and MRI showed stable AVN with no evidence of collapse. This report highlights SVF and PRP as a potential effective conservative option for non-traumatic talar AVN.

ABSTRACT Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are attractive electrochemical systems for large‐scale energy storage. Despite the most developed ones being those based on vanadium, the search for new chemistries is essential to overcome several problems associated with this metal identified as a critical raw material. All‐iron redox flow battery (A‐IRFB) is an interesting device due to iron abundance and worldwide distribution. However, the poor performance of its negative half‐cell, due to the sluggish plating/stripping processes related to the Fe 2+ /Fe 0 redox pair, negatively impacts its energy efficiency and long‐term performance. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of a low concentration of NaHSO 3 (10 mM), as a novel additive, to an electrolyte formulation based on 0.5 M FeCl 2 , 3 M NaCl, and 10 mM citric acid (H 3 Cit) remarkably improves the electrochemical behavior of the negative half‐cell. The enhanced performance can be explained as the additive guarantees a low oxygen solution content (reductant agent), promotes the plating/stripping reactions (improving the kinetics of the Fe 0 deposit through the formation of a FeHSO 3 + complex), and diminishes the contribution of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. The use of this key additive opens up a promising scenario for the development of A‐IRFBs with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, thus boosting their potential commercial development.

The solar transition region (TR) is a narrow interface between the chromosphere and corona, where emitted radiation contains critical information pertinent to coronal heating processes. We conducted 2-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations using adaptive mesh refinement to spatially resolve the fine structure of the TR while simultaneously capturing the larger-scale dynamics originating from surface convection. The time evolution of ionization fractions for oxygen ions is computed alongside the simulations. A minimum grid size of 1.25 km is achieved in the TR, enabling adequate resolution of the upper TR (log$_{10}T \gtrsim$ 5), although the lower TR (log$_{10}T \lesssim$ 5) remains under-resolved. Doppler shifts and nonthermal widths synthesized from TR lines exhibit convergence with grid sizes as coarse as 40 km, though some discrepancies persist between our results and observed TR line properties. A notable enhancement in emission from \ion{O}{6} lines, converging at a grid size of 2.5 km, shows an intensity 1.2 times that expected under ionization equilibrium, attributable to shock interactions with the TR. While model refinements are still required, our ability to resolve the TR offers critical insights into TR line characteristics arising from non-equilibrium ionization states, advancing our understanding of the coronal heating problem.

Abstract Gold catalysts are extensively utilized in photothermal processes that rely on localized surface plasmon resonance effects. However, the development of novel gold(I)‐organic frameworks that function as highly efficient photothermal catalysts for the production of hydrogen peroxide from water and oxygen presents a fascinating and challenging research opportunity. Herein, three gold(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes (Au‐CTCs) based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are prepared, exhibiting good photothermal conversion efficiency and H 2 O 2 evolution rates. Utilizing the optimized Au‐TFPT, the production rates of H₂O₂ can reach as high as 51,987 µ m g⁻¹ h⁻¹, surpassing the performance of most reported metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), even with the use of sacrificial agents to accelerate the reaction. The thermal‐assisted photocatalytic mechanism is comprehensively studied by transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance, electron paramagnetic resonance, rotating ring disk electrode test, catalytic performance and among others, demonstrating thermal energy can enhance the mobility of photogenerated carriers and apparent quantum yield, regulate the reactive species ratio and H 2 O 2 selectivity, reduce the apparent activation energy of photocatalysis, and improve mass transfer rates, thereby accelerating the reaction process. This study offers new insights into the thermal‐assisted photocatalytic production of H 2 O 2 .

Exploiting biomimetic perception of invisible spectra in flexible artificial human vision systems (HVSs) is crucial for real-time dynamic information processing. Nevertheless, the fast processing of motion objects in natural environments poses a challenge, necessitating that these artificial HVSs simultaneously have swift photoresponse and nonvolatile memory. Here, inspired by the human retina, we propose a flexible UV neuromorphic visual synaptic device (NeuVSD) based on GaOx@GaN-composited nanowires for dynamic visual perception. Benefiting from the combined action of oxygen adsorption kinetics on the GaOx shell and photoelectronic excitation in the GaN core, the NeuVSD can achieve rapid photoresponse and long-term plasticity simultaneously, a feature that surpasses traditional devices based on persistent photoconductivity mechanisms. Beyond the optoelectronic synaptic plasticity, the flexible NeuVSD on the PET/PI substrate exhibits good performance stability after 1000 bending cycles, profiting from the high adaptability of nanowires. Furthermore, target recognition and motion detection with weak light intensities are achieved through the establishment of neuromorphic visual neural networks, relying on dynamic exposures and edge information processing, respectively. Real-time edge detection can still be realized under a 40% noise factor and effectively remove the noise background. The flexible NeuVSD array-based artificial visual system can enhance the capability of dynamic visual information processing in low-light and high-noise conditions, thereby fostering the evolution of in-sensor computing and artificial intelligence.

Nova shells are the remnants of a nova eruption in a cataclysmic variable system. By studying their geometry we can better understand the physical mechanisms that shape them during the nova eruption. A nova shell that challenges our current understanding of these processes is the shell observed around V1425 Aql. It has at least two different components: an inner and symmetric shell, and an outer and asymmetric shell, with the latter expanding faster than the former. The physical reason behind the asymmetric ejecta is not clear. We aim to characterize the properties and differences between these two components to understand the origin behind the unusual shape. We acquired MUSE data to study the spatial position and kinematics of the expanding gas across the shell. Our analysis includes channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and the reconstruction of the 3D geometry of the nova shell. Several emission lines are detected within the MUSE wavelength coverage, including but not limited to Balmer, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Helium lines. There are significant differences in the spectra of the inner and outer shells, with the latter being observed only in forbidden transitions, while the inner shows a mix of forbidden and allowed ones. Our analysis reveals that the outer shell has a geometry consistent with an arc-shaped structure that partially encircles the more spherical inner shell. Within the inner shell, clumpy structures start to be noticeable in the lines of H$\alpha$+[Nii]. We have constrained the geometry of the outer shell to an arc-shaped structure, although the physical reason behind its origin is still eluding us. Further monitoring of the evolution of both shells in this object might help to clarify the mechanism behind this unusual configuration.

The paper presents new data on the structure and composition of ultramafic rocks in the eastern part of the South Kraka massif. It is shown that the studied area is composed predominantly of spinel peridotites, among which the main role belongs to lherzolites with a low content of clinopyroxene (2–5%) and harzburgites, among which lens-shaped and bandshaped inclusions of monomineral olivine rocks – dunites – are quite often observed. The leading role in the structure of the rocks belongs to high-Mg olivine (Fo 87-94 ), a secondary role (2016). Nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Arabian Shield and genesis of Al-spinel micropods: Evidence from the mantle xenoliths of Harrat is played by high-Mg orthopyroxene (enstatite) and Ca-Mg clinopyroxene diopside. Rare minerals of the mantle stage are amphibole and plagioclase. A typical accessory mineral of ultramafic rocks is spinel, the composition of which varies from high-Al in lherzolites (Cr# = 0.16–0.3), to moderate-Al in harzburgites (Cr# = 0.3–0.55) and to high-Cr in dunites (Cr# = 0.6–0.85). Of the rare accessory minerals in the rocks, the following were identified: native copper, pentlandite, awaruite and PGM (laurite, irarsite, Os-Ir-Ru-alloys). The section of mantle ultramafic rocks of the Sargan Range completed its high-temperature evolution to the levels of the plagioclase peridotite facies, partly in the transition zone from spinel to plagioclase facies. An assessment of oxygen fugacity allows us to speak about more reducing conditions for the formation of rocks of the studied area compared to other similar formations of upper mantle origin and allows us to classify the studied ultramafic rocks as moderately depleted restites of the upper mantle under the riftogenic structure of the Paleo-Ural basin. The geochemical specialization of PGM also indicates a restite origin of ultramafic rocks. At the stage of cooling and tectonic transformations in the crust, ultramafic rocks underwent serpentinization.

Metallicity is a crucial tracer of galaxy evolution, providing insights into gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. At high redshift, these processes reveal how early galaxies assembled and enriched their interstellar medium. In this work, we present rest-frame optical spectroscopy of 12 massive ($\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})>9$) galaxies at $z\sim 6$-$8$ from the REBELS ALMA large program, observed with JWST NIRSpec/IFU in the prism mode. These observations span emission lines from [OII]$\lambda$3727,9 to [SII]$\lambda$6716,31, providing key information on nebular dust attenuation, ionisation states, and chemical abundances. We find lower O32 ratios (average $\sim3.7$) and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 equivalent widths (average ${EW_{[OIII]}}\sim390$\AA) than are generally found in existing large spectroscopic surveys at $z>6$, indicating less extreme ionising conditions. Strong-line diagnostics suggest that these systems are some of the most metal-rich galaxies observed at $z>6$ (average $Z_{\mathrm{gas}}\sim 0.4 Z_{\odot}$), including sources with near-solar oxygen abundances, in line with their high stellar masses (average $\log{M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}}\sim9.5$). Supplementing with literature sources at lower masses, we investigate the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations (MZR and FMR, respectively) over a 4 dex stellar mass range at $63$ studies.

The membrane electrode assembly in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) functions as the electrochemical reaction region, where the generated electric current relies on the diffusion of reactant gases and electron conduction. Drawing inspiration from biomechanics, this study embarked on constructing a database of PEMFC performance data. Similar to how biomechanical studies use advanced imaging and sensing techniques to map the internal workings of organisms, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were employed to capture the intricate fluid and gas behaviors within the fuel cell. The data was then used to train data-driven surrogate models based on artificial neural network (ANN) and improved differential evolution for rapid prediction and optimization. When considering the biomechanical aspects, we analyze the mechanical stresses and strains that occur within the membrane electrode assembly during operation. These biomechanical factors can affect the durability and performance of the fuel cell. The gas diffusion layer (GDL) is similar to the pore structure in biological tissues. The pore structure of biological organisms, such as bones, not only ensures the diffusion and transport of nutrients, but also provides space for the attachment of cells to maintain the growth and metabolism of bones. The optimization results revealed that the pores of the GDL, just like the pores of biological tissues, affect the diffusion efficiency of the reactant gases (similar to nutrients) to the catalytic layer, and an appropriate porosity ensures the supply of the reactants required for the electrochemical reactions inside the cell, and improves the PEMFC performance of the cell. By utilizing the random forest algorithm (RF) to conduct feature importance evaluation, we can gain further understanding and interpretation of the factors influencing coupling relationships. The researchers successfully identified the optimal values of GDL porosity and thickness, resulting in an 8.75% increase in power density and significant improvement in oxygen distribution uniformity. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the optimization, the optimized structural parameters were incorporated into CFD simulations. The validation results demonstrated close alignment between the optimized model's performance and actual values, confirming the efficacy and reliability of the optimization framework. Overall, this data-driven optimization approach provides an effective tool for multi-variable optimization of complex systems and holds significant importance in enhancing the performance and power density of PEMFC, while also taking into account the biomechanical factors that influence its long-term operation and stability.

Deciphering the most promising strategy for the evolution of cancer patient management remains a multifaceted, challenging affair to date. Additionally, such approaches often lead to microbial infections as side effects, probably due to the compromised immunity of the patients undergoing such treatment. Distinctly, this work delineates a rational combinatorial strategy harnessing stereogenic harmony in the diphenylalanine fragment, tethering it to an amphiphile 12-hydroxy-lauric acid at the N-terminus (compounds I-III) such that a potential therapeutic could be extracted out from the series. Aligned to the goal, the cytotoxic properties and cell viability of the compounds were investigated using two distinct cell lines: MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell) and HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney). Our rigorous investigations revealed that compounds I-III exhibited substantial cytotoxic impact on the MCF7 cell line. But from a pool of three constructs, compound III (12-hydroxy-lauric acid -d-Phe-l-Phe-OH) showed better selectivity toward cancerous MCF7 over normal HEK 293 in comparison to others, backed by computational calculations. Henceforth, it was fished out from the series and used for its elaborate anticancer activities using cell reactive oxygen species generation, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-dependent gene expression employing extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic factors as well as inflammatory biomarkers, namely, TNF-α and IL1-β. We anticipated that compound III, possessing mechanoresponsiveness and a nanofibrillar network, could be administered in patients with injections because of its shear-thinning properties. Moreover, the optimum partition coefficient of compound III might have allowed the scaffold to penetrate the cellular membranes and form a dilactate complex (compound VI) when exposed to the accumulated lactates/lactic acids, a common phenomenon observed within the hypoxic cancerous tumor cores, in accordance with the Warburg mechanism, thereby evading the cytotoxicity within normal cells. Besides, the supramolecular β-sheets of compound III manifest substantial antimicrobial efficacy against the common pathogens, two Gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus and B. subtilis, two Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and a fungus, C. albicans, along with proteolytic stability and high mechanical strength at physiological pH. Overall, we speculate that the discovery of these multifunctional bioinspired materials holds future promise as preferential therapeutics for the remediation of immune-susceptible cancer patients, afflicted by microbial infections arising alone or as side effects of chemotherapeutic medications.
