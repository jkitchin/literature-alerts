Abstract The industrial application of green hydrogen production from water electrolysis strongly depends on the invention of low‐cost, highly‐active, and stable nonprecious electrocatalysts for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a two‐step process is developed to prepare a NiCo‐Se/CFP bimetallic electrocatalyst by a low‐temperature selenization of NiCo‐PBA precursors electro‐deposited on carbon fibre paper. The NiCo‐Se/CFP bimetallic electrocatalyst exhibits good catalytic activity for the OER, with an overpotential of 307 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , and a Tafel slope of only 39.94 mV dec −1 in 1 M KOH. The steady current density and well‐preserved microscopic morphology during the 20 h electrolysis proves its outstanding stability. The high inherent activity of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the 3D porous structure, the synergistic effects of Ni, and Co active components doping, and low‐temperature selenization. The results provide an insightful reference for further improving composition and structure design while investigating nonprecious metal electrocatalysts.

Abstract Oxygen vacancy (OV) defect engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. However, the direct visual characterization of oxygen vacancies still remains technically limited. Herein, a bismuth titanate (Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , BTO‐OV) model photocatalyst containing oxygen vacancies is constructed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reveal the influence mechanism of distinctive periodic quantum well and oxygen vacancies on the charge transfer behavior in BTO. Notably, the distribution of oxygen vacancies is directly observed using the low‐dose integrated differential phase contrast‐scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC‐STEM), providing visual evidence for the location of these oxygen vacancies in BTO‐OV. Furthermore, the theoretical calculation results are verified by characterizing the photoelectric properties and conducting performance tests on the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) photosynthesis. Specifically, the oxygen vacancies and distinctive periodic quantum well in BTO‐OV accelerate charge separation, leading to a H 2 O 2 photosynthesis efficiency reaching 5278 µ m g −1 h −1 , which is 5 times that of the original BTO. This work offers theoretical and experimental references for the visual characterization of oxygen vacancies and the improvement of the charge transfer mechanism.

Transition‐metal nitrides (TMNs) have garnered considerable attention for energy conversion applications owing to their exceptional electronic structures and high catalytic activities. However, the scarcity of active sites in TMNs impedes their large‐scale application. This study describes the use of wetness impregnation and ionic‐liquid methods to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic clusters finely dispersed on nitrogen‐doped carbon (MoN@NC) substrates. The as‐synthesized electrocatalysts feature atomically dispersed MoN clusters, achieving an impressive onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and maintaining an overpotential of just 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The MoN@NC‐based zinc–air battery demonstrated a high‐power density of 151 mW/cm2, a robust specific discharge capacity of 759 mAh/gZn at 20 mA/cm2, and superior charge–discharge cycling stability exceeding 190 cycles. The detailed experimental characterization revealed that the uniformly dispersed MoN clusters served as the primary active sites driving the observed catalytic performance. Additionally, the present findings suggested significant correlations between the phase of the material, crystallization, atomic cluster distribution, support porosity, and nitridation temperature. These insights are expected to refine strategies for achieving atomically dispersed nitrides with optimized ORR performance.

Developing durable IrO2‐based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and sustained activity for over 650 hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70 V (~1200 mA cm‐2) for over 140 hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in‐situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re‐induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.

Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO2 produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine‐containing RuO2 (RuO2‐Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO2‐Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm‐2. Furthermore, the RuO2‐Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum‐coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200 hours at 100 mA cm‐2. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO2 by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO2 stability.

The complexity of the intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism, particularly the precise relationships between the local coordination geometry of active metal centers and the resulting OER kinetics, remains to be fully understood. Herein, we construct a series of 3 d transition metal-incorporated cobalt hydroxide-based nanobox architectures for the OER which contain tetrahedrally coordinated Co(II) centers. Combination of bulk- and surface-sensitive operando spectroelectrochemical approaches reveals that tetrahedral Co(II) centers undergo a dynamic transformation into highly active Co(IV) intermediates acting as the true OER active species which activate lattice oxygen during the OER. Such a dynamic change in the local coordination geometry of Co centers can be further facilitated by partial Fe incorporation. In comparison, the formation of such active Co(IV) species is found to be hindered in CoOOH and Co-FeOOH, which are predominantly containing [CoIIIO6] and [CoII/FeIIIO6] octahedra, respectively, but no mono-μ-oxo-bridged [CoIIO4] moieties. This study offers a comprehensive view of the dynamic role of local coordination geometry of active metal centers in the OER kinetics. The oxygen evolution reaction and its relationship with metal center coordination remain unclear. Here, the authors report that optimization of the local coordination geometry of Co centers plays a crucial role in facilitating the O-O bond formation atop high-valent Co (IV) sites.

NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) currently are the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. However, the development of high‐performance low cost OER electrocatalysts using straightforward strategies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we describe an innovative microbial mineralization‐based method for in situ‐induced preparation of NiFe LDH nanosheets loaded on nickel foam and demonstrate that this material serves as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. In the microbial mineralization process, bacteria adhere to electrode materials and promote the surface nucleation of nanomaterials when metal ions are present. Specifically, our findings indicate that biomineralization accelerates the formation and regulation of NiFe LDH. The new electrocatalyst displays excellent OER performance, with a small overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope down to 38.6 mV dec−1 in alkaline solution. The remarkable OER performance of the microbial mineralization‐derived electrocatalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect of NiFe LDH and a bacterial‐specific surface area that contains multiple active sites. This study has uncovered a new approach for the assembly of NiFe LDH that relies on biomineralization to bring about morphological and structural modification of LDH nanosheets.

Abstract The success of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) depends on active and robust electrocatalysts to facilitate oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Heteroatom-doped-RuO x has emerged as a promising electrocatalysts because heteroatoms suppress lattice oxygen participation in the OER, thereby preventing the destabilization of surface Ru and catalyst degradation. However, identifying suitable heteroatoms and achieving their atomic-scale coupling with Ru atoms are nontrivial tasks. Herein, to steer the reaction pathway away from the involvement of lattice oxygen, we integrate OER-active Ir atoms into the RuO 2 matrix, which maximizes the synergy between stable Ru and active Ir centers, by leveraging the changeable growth behavior of Ru/Ir atoms on lattice parameter-modulated templates. In PEMWE, the resulting (RuIr)O 2 /C electrocatalysts demonstrate notable current density of 4.96 A cm −2 and mass activity of 19.84 A mg Ru+Ir −1 at 2.0 V. In situ spectroscopic analysis and computational calculations highlight the importance of the synergistic coexistence of Ru/Ir-dual-OER-active sites for mitigating Ru dissolution via the optimization of the binding energy with oxygen intermediates and stabilization of Ru sites.

Abstract N‐doped carbon confined alloy catalysts possess considerable potential in facilitating oxygen electrocatalytic reaction and consequent applications in metal air batteries, but the sluggish catalytic kinetics and high reaction barrier of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remain the bottleneck restricting its further development. Here, a novel CoFe‐NiFe biphase alloy nanoheterojunction encapsulated within N‐doped carbon nanotubes (CoFe‐NiFe@NCNT) is fabricated via the hydrothermal carbothermic reduction approach. Owing to the plentiful active sites and high electrical conductance, the potential difference between OER and ORR amounts to merely 0.68 V. Simultaneously, the performance of the Zn‐air and Mg‐air batteries assembled by CoFe‐NiFe@NCNT serving as the air‐cathode are superior to that of commercial Pt/C + RuO 2 . The DFT outcomes reveal that the transformation between *OOH and *O is the rate‐determining step (RDS) of ORR/OER. Also, the synergy between the biphase alloy heterojunction and N‐doped carbon nanotubes is conducive to reduce the reaction energy barrier. This study offers a profound understanding toward the structural design of biphase alloy nanoheterojunction electrocatalysts and the utilization in metal‐air batteries for portable wearable electronic apparatuses.

In situ studies of the relationship between surface spin configurations and spin-related electrocatalytic reactions are crucial for understanding how magnetic catalysts enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance under magnetic fields. In this work, 2D Fe7Se8 nanosheets with rich surface spin configurations are synthesized via chemical vapor deposition. In situ magnetic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy reveal that a 200 mT magnetic field eliminates spin-disordered domain walls, forming a spin-ordered single-domain structure, which lowers the OER energy barrier, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. Electrochemical tests show that under a 200 mT magnetic field, the OER overpotential of multidomain Fe7Se8 nanosheets at 10 mA cm–2 decreases from 346 mV to 259 mV, while the magnetic field has minimal effect on single-domain nanosheets. These findings highlight the critical role of spin configurations in enhancing electrocatalytic performance, offering new insights into the design of magnetic catalysts for industrial applications.

Mitigating global warming necessitates transitioning from fossil fuels to alternative energy carriers like hydrogen. Efficient hydrogen production via electrocatalysis requires high-performance, stable anode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to support the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Developing noble metal-free electrocatalysts is therefore crucial, particularly for acidic electrolytes, to avoid reliance on scarce and expensive metals such as Ir and Ru. This study investigates a low-cost, solvent-free solid-state synthesis of CoSb2O6, focusing on the influence of calcination time and temperature. Six samples were prepared and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and electrochemical techniques. A non-pure CoSb2O6 phase was observed across all samples. Electrochemical testing revealed good short-term stability; however, all samples exhibited Tafel slopes exceeding 200 mV dec−1 and overpotentials greater than 1 V. The sample calcined at 600 °C for 6 h showed the best performance, with the lowest Tafel slope and overpotential, attributed to its high CoSb2O6 content and maximized {110} facet exposure. This work highlights the role of calcination protocols in developing Co-based OER catalysts and offers insights for enhancing their electrocatalytic properties.

Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in energy conversion and storage technologies. The precise identification of active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for developing an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. However, this remains a challenging endeavor. Here, it is demonstrated that metal‐free N‐doped defective carbon material derived from triazene derivative exhibits excellent bifunctional activity, achieving a notable ΔE value of 0.72 V. Through comprehensive X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopic analyses, the active sites responsible for oxygen electrocatalysis are elucidated, resolving a long‐standing issue. Specifically, pyridinic‐N sites are crucial for ORR, while graphitic‐N are good for OER. A predictive model utilizing π‐electron descriptors further aids in identifying these sites, with theoretical insights aligning with experimental results. Additionally, in situ ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy provides clarity on reaction intermediates for both reactions. This research paves the way for developing metal‐free, site‐specific electrocatalysts for practical applications in energy technologies.

Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal technology for storing intermittent electricity from renewable sources into hydrogen fuel. However, its overall energy efficiency is impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In the quest to design high-performance anode catalysts for driving the OER under non-acidic conditions, iron (Fe) has emerged as a crucial element. Although the profound impact of adventitious electrolyte Fen+ species on OER catalysis had been reported forty years ago, recent interest in tailoring the electrode-electrolyte interface has spurred studies on the controlled introduction of Fe ions into the electrolyte to improve OER performance. During the catalytic process, scenarios where the rate of Fen+ deposition on a specific host material outruns that of dissolution pave the way for establishing highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces for long-term steady operation. This review systematically summarizes recent endeavors devoted to elucidating the behaviors of in situ Fe(aq.) incorporation, the role of incorporated Fe sites in the OER, and critical factors influencing the interplay between the electrode surface and Fe ions in the electrolyte environment. Finally, unexplored issues related to comprehensively understanding and leveraging the dynamic exchange of Fen+ at the interface for improved OER catalysis are summarized.

Abstract Exploring highlyefficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is a challenging butnecessary task for development of green and renewable energy. Herein, PtIrFeCoNi high‐entropy alloy nanoflowers (HEA NFs) withstrong 3d‐5d orbital hybridization were fabricated to achieve highly efficientoverall water splitting at high current density. The Pt 26 Ir 7 Fe 13 Co 22 Ni 32 HEA NFs achieved a 57.52‐fold higher than commercial IrO 2 in turnoverfrequency (TOF) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides, its TOF value forhydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was 2.11‐fold higher than that of commercialPt/C. The cell voltages based on Pt 26 Ir 7 Fe 13 Co 22 Ni 32 HEA NFs for overall water splitting were only 1.594 V and 1.861 V at currentdensities of 100 mA cm −2 and 500 mA cm −2 , which weresignificantly lower than those of Pt/C

Transition metal‐based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition‐diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi‐C‐N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre‐deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9 nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization.

Transition metal‐based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition‐diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi‐C‐N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre‐deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9 nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization. The unique crystalline‐amorphous heterojunction interface enhances electrocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the electronic regulation of metal sites by interstitial C and N atoms not only optimizes the adsorption‐dissociation process in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also accelerates the surface reconstruction of hydroxyl oxides to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As a result, the as‐prepared coating achieved overpotentials of only 62 and 237 mV for the HER and OER at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolytes, and exhibited excellent OWS performance and long‐term stability at high current densities.

Abstract Transition metal oxides like Co, Ni, and Mn are promising alternatives to noble metals such as Pt for oxygen electrocatalysis in green energy. Alloying these metals forms multicomponent catalysts with compelling properties. In this study, CoCrFeNi and MnCrFeNi thin films are synthesized using High‐Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) and their catalytic activity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and corrosion resistance in 1 molar (1 M) potassium hydroxide (KOH) are evaluated. MnCrFeNi films exhibit a fine‐grained single face‐centered cubic (FCC) phase, while CoCrFeNi films have larger grains and multiple phases. ORR on CoCrFeNi follows a 2+1 electron transfer pathway, producing hydroxide radicals, while MnCrFeNi exhibits a 2‐electron pathway, yielding hydrogen peroxide. Anodization reduces the CoCrFeNi overpotential from 0.9 to 0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), comparable to platinum and iridium catalysts (Pt/C, Ir/C). Anodization also shifts CoCrFeNi ORR to a 2‐electron pathway. In situ Raman spectroscopy detects no ORR intermediates, but nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) appears during OER. Substituting Mn for Co increases corrosion resistance by raising the corrosion potential. All films show passive behavior during polarization, demonstrating their potential for corrosion protection and electrocatalysis in green energy applications.

The study of degradation behavior of electrocatalysts in an industrial context calls for rapid and efficient analysis methods. Optical methods like Raman spectroscopy fulfil these requirements and are thus predestined for this purpose. However, the iridium utilized in proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is Raman inactive in its metallic state. This work demonstrates the high oxidation sensitivity of iridium and its utilization in analysis of catalyst materials. Laser induced oxidation Raman spectroscopy (LIORS) is established as a novel method for qualitative, chemical and structural analysis of iridium catalysts. Differences in particle sizes of iridium powders drastically change oxidation sensitivity. Oxidation of the iridium powders to IrO2 occurred at a laser power density of 0.47 ± 0.06 mW μm-2 for the 850 μm powder and at 0.12 ± 0.06 mW μm-2 and 0.019 ± 0.015 mW μm-2 for the 50 μm and 0.7-0.9 μm powders respectively. LIORS was utilized to assess possible deterioration of an iridium electrocatalyst due to operation under electrolysis. The operating electrocatalyst exhibited higher oxidation sensitivity, suggesting smaller iridium particle size due to catalyst dissolution. Peak shifts of the IrO2 signal were utilized to assess differences in transformation temperatures. The operated electrocatalyst transformed to IrO2 at lower temperature (8 cm-1 redshift) relative to the pristine catalyst (10 cm-1 redshift), demonstrating that pre-oxidation of the iridium to amorphous IrOx during electrolysis diminishes the energy barrier needed for IrO2 formation. Thus, LIORS can be utilized as a straightforward screening method for the analysis of iridium electrocatalysts in the industrial application of PEMEL.

Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO2 produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine‐containing RuO2 (RuO2‐Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO2‐Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm‐2. Furthermore, the RuO2‐Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum‐coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200 hours at 100 mA cm‐2. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO2 by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO2 stability.

The perovskite oxides CaMnO3-δ, Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ, and SrMnO3-δ were synthesized in air using a solid-state method, and their structural, electrical, and electrocatalytic properties were studied in relation to their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Iodometric titration showed δ values of 0.05, 0.05, and 0.0, respectively, indicating that Mn is predominantly in the 4+ oxidation state across all materials, consistent with prior reports. Detailed characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), iodometric titration, and variable-temperature conductivity measurements. Four-point probe DC measurements revealed that CaMnO3-δ (δ = 0.05) has a semiconductive behavior over a temperature range from 25 °C to 300 °C, with its highest conductivity attributed to polaron activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M KOH was employed to assess OER catalytic performance, which correlated with room-temperature conductivity. CaMnO3-δ exhibited superior catalytic activity, followed by Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ and SrMnO3-δ, demonstrating that increased conductivity enhances OER performance. The conductivity trend, CaMnO3-δ > Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ > SrMnO3-δ, aligns with OER activity, underscoring a direct link between electronic transport properties and catalytic efficiency within this series.

High-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes are critical for electrochemical water splitting in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, a clean fuel for sustainable energy conversion and storage. Among OER catalysts, solid-state synthesized SrCo1−xIrxO3 has demonstrated superior activity compared to commercial standards, such as IrO2 and RuO2. However, the solid-state synthesis process is economically inefficient for industrial use due to the potential for impurities and low yield of the final product. In addition, the requirement for electrochemical cycling to activate the catalyst introduces contaminations and uncertainties for industrial applications. In this study, a modified solution-based sol–gel method was employed to produce SrCo0.5Ir0.5O3 (SCIO) with high purity and yield. Subsequent ball milling and acid leaching treatments were applied, resulting in a catalyst with higher efficiency than those activated solely by electrochemical cycling. The electrochemical analysis and physical characterizations of our SCIO catalyst after ex-situ post-synthesis treatments show a similar active phase in composition and structure to those obtained through in situ electrochemical cycling and activation. Our approach simplifies the preparation process, making the catalyst ready for direct use in PEM electrolyzers without further treatment, offering a promising solution for producing high-performance, industrial-scale OER catalysts.

Developing durable IrO2‐based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and sustained activity for over 650 hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70 V (~1200 mA cm‐2) for over 140 hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in‐situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re‐induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.

Abstract Hydrogen, a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, can be efficiently produced by electrochemical water splitting, which involves hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Both HER and OER require electrocatalysts. The large scale implementation of this technology depends heavily on the development of highly active, stable, and cost‐effective electrocatalysts. In view of this, several electrocatalysts have been explored. Herein, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of MnCO 3 synthesized by hydrothermal method is reported. While MnCO 3 is chosen as the electrocatalyst owing to cost‐effect and abundant precursors, environmental friendliness, and good electrochemical activity, the hydrothermal method is chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and scalability. The micron size MnCO 3 synthesized hydrothermally exhibits η 10 of 143 mV, a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec −1 and retains its performance over 3000 cycles and 14 h of continuous operation in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 , demonstrating its utility in sustainable hydrogen production.

Activated N-doped carbon derived from water hyacinth leaves (WHL) was prepared and investigated as metal-free bi-functional catalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution (ORR/OER) in zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods were used to examine the morphology, elemental composition and the specific surface area of the samples, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at rotating disk electrodes (RDEs) and rotating ring-disk electrodes (RRDEs) were employed to characterize the electrocatalytic activities. The electrochemical studies reveal that N-doped porous carbon from N-WHLs exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity for ORR, with an onset potential of 0.95 V and half-wave potential of 0.88 V comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst. It also displays promising activity towards OER, with an overall potential of 1.86 V versus RHE to reach a current density of 10 mAcm, resulting in an oxygen electrode activity (OEA) value of 0.98 V. The percentage of hydrogen peroxide produced was significantly low, with average electron transfer number value of 3.94 at 0.8 V for N-WHL. Furthermore, the ZAB using N-WHL catalysts as an air cathode displayed a power density of 84 mW cm−2 and superior stability over 450 hours.

Abstract Inducing magnetic ordering in a non‐ferrous layered double hydroxides (LDHs) instigates higher spin polarization, which leads to enhanced efficiency during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In nano‐sized magnetic materials, the concept of elongated grains drives domain alignment under the application of an external magnetic field. Hence, near the solid electrode interface, modified magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) positively impacts the electrocatalytic ability of non‐ferrous nanocatalysts. Consequently, significant improvement in the water‐splitting kinetics can be obtained by using even low magnetic fields. At 100 Gauss, 20% and 10% decrement in the overpotential is reported for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are also presented to explain the thermodynamics of the HER/OER processes. It is established that the Gibbs energy of the process can reduce the exchange energy barrier by using dopant like cobalt. The additional cobalt metal active site have the highest probability for adsorption of reactive intermediates during HER and OER, which results in higher efficiencies.

Abstract The design and fabrication of nanocatalysts with high accessibility and sintering resistance remain significant challenges in heterogeneous electrocatalysis. Herein, a novel catalyst is introduced that combines electronic pumping with alloy crystal facet engineering. At the nanoscale, the electronic pump leverages the chemical potential difference to drive electron migration from one region to another, separating and transferring electron‐hole pairs. This mechanism accelerates the reaction kinetics and improves the reaction rate. The interface electronic structure optimization enables the CoFe/carbon nanotube (CNT) catalyst to exhibit outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Specifically, this catalyst achieves an ORR half‐wave potential (E₁/₂) of 0.895 V, outperforming standard Pt/C and RuO₂ electrocatalysts in terms of both specific activity and stability. It also demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance for OER, with an overpotential of only 287 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻ 2 . Theoretical calculations reveal that the carefully designed crystal facets reduce the energy barrier of the rate‐determining steps for both ORR and OER, optimizing O₂ adsorption and promoting the oxygen capture process. This study highlights the potential of developing cost‐effective bifunctional ORR–OER electrocatalysts, offering a promising strategy for advancing Zn–air battery technology.

Electrocatalytic water splitting (EWS) driven by renewable energy is vital for clean hydrogen (H 2 ) production and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. While IrO 2 and RuO 2 are the leading electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Pt for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic environments, the need for efficient, stable, and affordable materials persists. Recently, transition‐metal borides (TMBs), particularly metal diborides (MDbs), have gained attention due to their unique layered crystal structures with multicentered boron bonds, offering remarkable physicochemical properties. Their nearly 2D structures boost electrochemical performance by offering high conductivity and a large active surface area, making them well‐suited for advanced energy storage and conversion technologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the critical factors for water splitting, the crystal and electronic structures of MDbs, and their synthetic strategies. Furthermore, it examines the relationship between catalytic performance and intermediate adsorption as elucidated by first‐principle calculations. The review also highlights the latest experimental advancements in MDb‐based electrocatalysts and addresses the current challenges and future directions for their development.

Abstract Constructing bifunctional electrocatalysts through the synergistic effect of diverse metal sites is crucial for achieving high‐efficiency and steady overall water splitting. Herein, a “dual‐HER/OER‐sites‐in‐one” strategy is proposed to regulate dominant active sites, wherein Ni/Co(OH) 2 ‐Ru heterogeneous catalysts formed on nickel foam (NF) demonstrate remarkable catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the potentials@10 mA cm −2 of Ni/Co(OH) 2 ‐Ru@NF for overall alkaline water and seawater splitting are only 1.36 and 1.41 V, respectively, surpassing those of commercial RuO 2 @NF and Pt/C@NF. The Ru site is identified as the primary active site for HER by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, while the Co(OH) 2 site displays the minimal rate‐determining step energy barrier (RDS) and functions as the main active site for OER. This study offers novel perspectives on the rational utilization of diverse metal species’ catalytic capabilities for developing dual active sites multifunctional electrocatalysts.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is characterized by a lower overpotential compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during electrolysis, which facilitates the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Charge distribution, which can be modulated by the introduction of a heterostructure, plays a key role in enhancing the adsorption and cleavage of chemical groups within urea molecules. Herein, a facile all-room temperature synthesis of functional heterojunction NiCo2S4/CoMo2S4 grown on carbon cloth (CC) is presented, and the as-prepared electrode served as a catalyst for simultaneous hydrogen evolution and urea oxidation reaction. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) study reveals spontaneous transfer of charge at the heterointerface of NiCo2S4/CoMo2S4, which triggers the formation of localized electrophilic/nucleophilic regions and facilitates the adsorption of electron donating/electron withdrawing group in urea molecules during the UOR. The NiCo2S4/CoMo2S4// NiCo2S4/CoMo2S4 electrode pair required only a cell voltage of 1.17 and 1.18 V to deliver a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 respectively in urea electrolysis cell and display very good stability. Tests performed in real urine samples show similar catalytic performance to urea electrolytes, making the work one of the best transition metal-based catalysts for UOR applications, promising both efficient hydrogen production and urea decomposition.

Developing clean and renewable energy technologies requires the design of efficient bifunctional catalysts that do not rely on inert metals for electrochemical water splitting. This study introduced a novel three-step strategy to fabricate NiCoFe-modified MoNi4/MoO2 nanowires supported on nickel foam substrates (denoted as NiCoFe-MoNi4/MoO2/NF), which demonstrate excellent catalytic performance with an impressively low overpotential of just 13 mV at 10 mA·cm–2 current density for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 230 mV at 50 mA·cm–2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, its performance greatly exceeded that of many noble-metal catalysts, requiring only 1.51 V for overall water splitting at 50 mA·cm–2 current density. The exceptional catalytic efficiency is ascribed to the unique one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure and the synergistic interactions between the NiCoFe complex and the MoNi4/MoO2 framework, which improve mass transfer, increase active site exposure, and enhance intrinsic catalytic activity. The incorporation of cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) into the ternary complex significantly enhanced the efficiencies of both HER and OER, offering a promising route for developing high-performance, low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts and advancing sustainable energy conversion technologies.

Abstract Enhancing the catalytic performance and durability of M‐N─C catalyst is crucial for the efficient operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and Zn‐Air batteries (ZABs). Herein, an approach is developed for the in situ fabrication of a MOFs‐derived porous carbon material, co‐loaded with Co nanoparticles (NPs) and Co‐N x sites and integrated onto Fe‐doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs), named Co NP/SA ‐NC/Fe‐NCNTs. Incorporating polymer‐wrapped CNTs improves MOFs dispersion annealing at high temperature, which amplifies the three‐phase boundary (TPB) by generating much more mesopores and exposing additional active sites within the catalysts layer. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the presence of Co NPs promotes the conversion of oxygen‐containing intermediates for Co‐N x sites. The optimized catalysts display a half‐wave potential of 0.9 V (vs RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential of 327 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, which significantly outperforms the counterpart single structure, as well as noble‐metal‐based catalysts. Specifically, the PEMFCs and ZABs derived from Co NP/SA ‐NC/Fe‐NCNTs catalyst exhibit power densities of 702 and 192 mW cm −2 , respectively. This work offers novel insights into the synthesis of the composited bifunctional carbon materials for ZABs and PEMFCs application.

Methanol (ME) is a liquid hydrogen carrier, ideal for on-site-on-demand H2 generation, avoiding its costly and risky distribution issues, but this "ME-to-H2" electric conversion suffers from high voltage (energy consumption) and competitive oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that a synergistic cofunctional Pt1Pdn/(Ni,Co)(OH)x catalyst with Pt single atoms (Pt1) and Pd nanoclusters (Pdn) anchored on OH-vacancy(VOH)-rich (Ni,Co)(OH)x nanoparticles create synergistic triadic active sites, allowing for methanol-enhanced low-voltage H2 generation. For MOR, OH* is preferentially adsorbed on Pdn and then interacts with the intermediates (such as *CHO or *CHOOH) adsorbed favorably on neighboring Pt1 with the assistance of hydrogen bonding from the surface hydrogen of (Ni,Co)(OH)x. The enhanced selectivity of the *CHOOH pathway, instead of *CO, sustains the MOR activity to a practically high current density. For HER, triadic Pt1, Pdn, and OH-vacancy sites on (Ni,Co)(OH)x create an "acid-base" microenvironment to facilitate water adsorption and splitting, forming H* species on Pt1 and Pdn, and *OH at the vacancy, to promote efficient H2 evolution from the asymmetric Pt1 and Pdn sites via the Tafel mechanism. The triadic-site synergy opens new avenues for the design and synthesis of highly efficient and stable cofunctional catalysts for "on-site-on-demand" H2 production, here facilitated by liquid methanol.

Abstract The vast compositional space of high-entropy materials offers unprecedented opportunities for the development of powerful catalysts. However, their inverse design remains unfeasible due to the lack of robust theoretical frameworks and high-throughput experimental tools. This study demonstrates a practical inverse design approach that integrates spectroscopic descriptors, generative machine learning, and a robotic experimental platform to synthesize and optimize catalyst composition for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The automated system significantly accelerated catalysts design and experimental validation, reducing the time required for synthesis, characterization and performance testing from approximately 20 hours to only 78 minutes per sample. Following a rapid screen for efficient senary high-entropy catalysts, the spectroscopic generative model further optimized the top-performing candidate, lowering its overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 by an additional 32 mV. Our findings are a testament to the potential of an inverse design approach that incorporates spectroscopic descriptors into generative machine learning to accelerate catalyst discovery. Moreover, this approach is also expected to drive the intelligent design of high-performance complex materials.

Abstract Developing overall water splitting non‐noble metal electrocatalysts achieving long‐term stability with high activity at industrial‐grade current density remains challenging. Herein, a self‐reconstruction strategy of Co 9 S 8 ‐Ni 3 S 2 /NCF is employed to fabricate Ni x Co 3‐x O 4 ‐Ov‐ in which partial Co is replaced by Ni in the structure. The reconstructed Ni x Co 3‐x O 4 ‐Ov can enhance the adsorbing ability of leached from the initial phase compared with Co spinel, achieving exceeding 1000‐h oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 600‐h overall water splitting stability at 1000 mA cm −2 with excellent activity. In situ Raman and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that partial substitution of Ni for Co atoms enhances the adsorption capacity on the reconstructed Ni x Co 3‐x O 4 ‐Ov, facilitating the formation of high‐density Co 3+ active sites on (400) that expedited interfacial electron transfer at high current densities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adsorption of leached stabilizes surface oxygen vacancies and optimizes the adsorption energy of intermediates, thereby improving both stability and catalytic performance. The findings provide new insights into overcoming the activity‐stability trade‐off and contribute to the strategy for the design of electrocatalysts for long‐term water splitting at industrial‐grade current densities.

Abstract Photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes will play a crucial role in future clean energy systems, however severe charge recombination and sluggish charge transfer kinetics have hindered their practical adoption. Exploiting ferroelectric polarization‐controlled charge dynamics promises an additional lever that can potentially enable the performance limits of traditional static photoelectrodes to be surpassed. Here one of the most notable ferroelectric polarization‐induced photocurrent enhancements is reported, using a heterostructure of the multiferroic bismuth ferrite (BFO) and the photoactive bismuth vanadate (BVO) in a neutral pH electrolyte. In contrast to previous works, enhancements for both poling directions are reported, of 136% for down‐poled BFO/BVO and 70% for up‐poled BFO/BVO at 1.23 V RHE in comparison to the unpoled sample, delivering a Faradaic efficiency of >95% for prolonged oxygen evolution reaction. Extensive PEC and surface analyses complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the improvements are attributed to the modulation of gradients in the BFO band energies, as well as changes in band‐bending and offsets at the interfaces. Given the scalability of the employed sol–gel synthesis method and the use of environmentally benign materials and PEC conditions, these findings pave the way for multifunctional materials as new‐generation agile and dynamic catalysts and photoelectrode systems.

Introducing foreign elements into a crystal lattice could trigger phase transformation, serving as an excellent means to fabricate highly electrocatalytic phases. NiCo2S4 is a notably electrocatalytic thiospinel phase, normally synthesized via two‐step route and rarely explored for electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). This work reports one‐step hydrothermal syntheses of NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 and their performance for HzOR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Time‐dependent syntheses suggest formation of (M, Co)9S8; M=Ni/Cu phase, followed by conversion to the respective thiospinel phase. Computational study validates that the incorporation of Ni into Co9S8 disrupts its stability and induces the formation of a stable bi‐metallic thiospinel phase. Even without the assistance of metal foam substrate, NiCo2S4 displayed remarkable activity for HzOR requiring potentials of 153 and 350 mV to afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA/cm2, respectively. Furthermore, NiCo2S4 showed good activity for OER, providing 10 mA/cm2 at 290 mV. For hydrazine‐assisted H2 production, the two‐electrode setup, NiCo2S4||Pt/C attained a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at 140 mV, which is 1.39 V less than that required for conventional water electrolyzer (1.53 V). Long‐term durability of NiCo2S4 for both HzOR and OER at high current densities highlights the suitability of the catalyst for practical applications.

Abstract Developing efficient, multifunctional electrodes for energy storage and conversion devices is crucial. Herein, lattice strains are reported in the β‐phase polymorph of CoMoO 4 within CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 heterostructure via phosphorus doping (P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 ) and used as a high‐performance trifunctional electrode for supercapacitors (SCs), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. A tensile strain of +2.42% on the β‐phase of CoMoO 4 in P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 results in superior electrochemical performance compared to CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 . The optimized P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 achieves a high energy density of 118 Wh kg −1 in an asymmetric supercapacitor and low overpotentials of 189 mV for the HER and 365 mV for the OER at a current density of 500 mA cm −2 . This results in a low overall water splitting voltage of 1.71 V at the same current density making it an effective bifunctional electrode in a 1 m KOH freshwater electrolyte. Theoretical analysis shows that the excellent performance of P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 can be attributed to interfacial interactions between CoMoO 4 and Co 3 O 4 , and the β‐phase of CoMoO 4 , which lead to strong OH − adsorption and low energy barriers for reaction intermediates. Practical application is demonstrated by using P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 ‐based ASCs to self‐generate hydrogen (H 2 ) in a P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 ||P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 alkaline seawater electrolyzer, showcasing its potential for future energy technologies.

Abstract The study introduces flexible and scalable manufacturing approach for electrodes utilizing boron‐doped silicon as conductive support for iridium nanoparticles, addressing the challenges of cost and scarcity associated wit noble catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Colloidal Ir nanoparticles are synthesized via pulsed‐laser ablation (≈4–7 nm) and decorated on B‐doped Si (≈100 nm) through electrostatic adsorption. Titanium substrates are ultrasonically sprayed with Si:B – Ir and Ir nanoparticles with very low iridium loading of 12 wt.%. Crystalline Ir phases (Ir(111), Ir(200)) are observed and known to enhance the OER mechanism. Additionally, atom probe tomography confirms that the Si support particles contained 0.03‐0.5 at% of boron throughout the entire particle, while electrical permittivity and through‐plane measurements reveal a positive impact of B‐doped Si on the electrical conductivity of the nanocatalysts and of the ultralow‐loaded catalyst coated Ti substrates (0.12 mg Ir cm −2 ), respectively. Rotating disk electrode results show pronounced oxidation peaks for decorated Ir nanoparticles. The Si:B‐Ir 4 nm catalyst exhibits the highest turonover frequency (2.62 s⁻¹) and a competitive electrochemical surface area (25 m 2 g Ir −1 ) compared to Si:B‐Ir 7 nm (0.96 s⁻¹; 37.5 m 2 g Ir −1 ) and Ir black (0.24 s⁻¹; 5 m 2 g Ir −1 ). The overall analysis of the parameters highlights a performant catalytic efficiency, through balancing activity and reaction kinetics effectively.

Iridium (Ir)-based catalysts embracing both catalytic activity and stability are of great significance for scaling up the application of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein, supported IrO2 on TiO2 (IrO2/TiO2) with high specific surface area and electrolytic activity was prepared by adopting a chlorine (Cl)-free synthesis based on the Adams fusion method. The crucial influential factors of annealing temperature were systematically explored on the catalytic activity and stability of IrO2/TiO2. Although increasing annealing temperature is believed to be of benefit to the increase of crystallinity and nanoparticle size in the catalyst, thus improving the stability of the catalyst, the as-prepared catalyst annealed at high temperature exhibited inferior stability at a constant-current density working state. This result is mainly attributed to the adverse impact of the annealing process at high temperatures on the catalytic activity, in terms of decreasing the active surface area due to the aggregation effect and decreasing the intrinsic activity due to the formation of a highly crystalline structure. The inferior catalytic activity caused by the adverse impact can induce a large working voltage, which can accelerate the catalyst degradation via a positive feedback mechanism (PFM) beneath the electrocatalytic system consisting of 'catalytic activity–electrocatalytic performance (working voltage)–aging'. Besides, the influences of Cl residue on the catalytic activity and stability of the as-prepared IrO2/TiO2 were also investigated by substituting a Cl-free precursor using IrCl3 (IrO2/TiO2–Cl). It presented slightly inferior initial oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic performance to that using a Cl-free precursor, perhaps due to the strong adsorption of Cl residue on IrO2 nanoparticles. However, the stability of the as-prepared IrO2/TiO2–Cl deteriorates significantly in chronopotentiometric measurement probably due to the PFM. Consequently, catalytic activity and stability are of equal significance; both the annealing temperature and Cl residue need to be fine-tuned to achieve an optimal combination of catalytic activity and stability.

ii regions closest to the centre of the MW (at a radii of 4-5 kpc) are close to the binned oxygen abundances in NGC 3521 at the same galactocentric distances; an accurate value of the central oxygen abundance in the MW cannot be established because of the lack of the measurements near the centre. The oxygen abundances in the outer part of the MW are lower than those in the outer part of NGC 3521. The gas mass fraction in the outer part of the MW is higher than in NGC 3521. The obtained values of the effective oxygen yield, Y_eff, in NGC 3521 are close to the empirical estimation of the oxygen yield, Y_O. This suggests that mass exchange with the surroundings plays little to no role in the current chemical evolution of NGC3521. The values of the Y_eff in the MW were determined using two variants of the radial distribution of the gas mass surface density. The values of the Y_eff in the MW obtained with the first distribution are also close to Y_O, as in NGC 3521. The Y_eff in the MW obtained with the second distribution are below Y_O at radii between ∼6 and ∼10.4 kpc. This suggests that the mass exchange with the surroundings can play a significant role in the chemical evolution of this part of the MW, in contrast to that in NGC 3521. To draw a solid conclusion about the role of mass exchange with the surroundings in the chemical evolution of the MW it is essential to determine which of these distributions provides a more adequate description of the gas distribution in the MW.

We applied a highly accurate Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to obtain thermodynamic data for various water-nitrogen clusters. In combination with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and wavefunction analysis, we proposed a theoretical pathway for the evolution of nitrogen-water cation clusters, offering insights into the formation of oxidative environments. Our calculations reveal that nitrogen molecules can form weak bonds with certain hydrogen-oxygen cations, stabilizing key intermediates during hydroxyl radical transfer. Such interaction alters the cluster’s evolution. Our findings show a clear map of how nitrogen-water cluster cations evolve and give oxidative reactants.

The oxidation of carbon fiber ablators for thermal protection systems has been extensively studied for atmospheric reentry missions. We investigate this oxidation process at the atomic scale using atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (A-KMC) simulations, focusing on the influence of two pathways of oxygen adsorption on carbon oxidation: adsorption of oxygen on the basal plane as epoxy groups and adsorption of oxygen directly on the edges of defects. We find that the majority of CO formation results from oxygen adsorbed on the basal plane, which subsequently diffuses toward defect edges. This is due to the greater availability of basal sites relative to defect edges throughout most of the simulation, and the rapid diffusion of epoxy groups toward defect edges at the studied temperatures (1700–2200 K). In this study, we exploit the temporal data from these A-KMC simulations to investigate the dynamics between the adsorption and CO formation reactions as they evolve with time. From KMC, we obtain time series that represent the time evolution of the frequency of occurrence of these reactions in the model. Pearson's correlation coefficient is used as a metric to identify correlated relationships between time series. By comparing adsorption and CO formation time series using this metric, we find that the contribution of each adsorption reaction toward CO formation varies with time due to the evolving oxidized graphite structure. Specifically, as the ratio of basal plane sites (nbasal) to defect edge sites (nedge) decreases during the simulation, the contribution of basal plane adsorption relative to direct edge adsorption toward CO formation also decreases. We also address several challenges associated with conducting time series analysis in KMC due to the stochastic nature of the method.

Pogo is identified as a deep-seated, intrusion-related gold deposit. Carbonate minerals have a close spatial relationship to hydrothermal gold mineralization in all of its principal ore zones. The carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of carbonate minerals (siderite, ankerite, and calcite) present within the deposit illustrate the isotopic evolution of the ore-forming fluid. The initial hydrothermal fluid phase is interpreted to be magmatic in origin. The fluid evolution was characterized by a gradual decrease in δ18O and a slight increase in δ13C with decreasing temperature. The dominant carbon-bearing species was CO2, with methane introduced sporadically. Siderite is associated with early-stage mineralization and occurs with ankerite in main-stage ore assemblages. Calcite is recognized in the later stages of mineralization. Gold in the Pogo deposit occurs as native gold, Au-Bi-Te minerals, inclusions in sulfide minerals, or as “invisible gold”. The latter is found in pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and quartz, based on ion microprobe analysis. The presence of invisible gold in these minerals has significant metallurgical implications for gold processing at the Pogo mine.

Modern-day applications demand onboard electricity generation that can be achieved using piezoelectric phenomena. Reducing the dimensionality of materials is a pathway to enhancing the piezoelectric properties. Transition-metal dichalcogenides have been shown to exhibit high piezoelectricity. Monolayer MoS2 possesses strong piezoelectricity that is otherwise negligible in its bulk form. The presence of sulfur vacancy defects in two-dimensional MoS2 can starkly reduce piezoelectric output due to enhanced charge screening. Oxygen passivation offers thermodynamically favorable and superior vacancy passivation. Here, we demonstrate an in situ oxygen passivation of sulfur vacancies achieved by performing chemical vapor deposition in atmospheric pressure conditions, resulting in a dramatically enhanced piezoelectric output. We achieved an out-of-plane effective piezoelectric coefficient d33eff 0.54 pm/V for the MoS2 monolayer with sulfur vacancies (SV-MoS2) and 0.94 pm/V where sulfur vacancies are passivated by oxygen (OP-MoS2). The piezoelectric device (PED) based on OP-MoS2 exhibits 26% higher output voltage than SV-MoS2 with the maximum peak-to-peak value of 0.95 V. Additionally, we show that the OP-MoS2-based PED can charge a 330 nF capacitor 30% faster than the SV-MoS2 PED for up to 50 mV in 0.5 s by repetitive finger tapping. The evolution of piezoelectricity in MoS2 with sulfur vacancy defect manipulation promises an avenue for scalable defect engineering for next-generation applications in miniaturized self-powered electronics and sensors across computing, healthcare, and size-, weight-, and power-constrained environments.

In this study, hydrogeochemistry and environmentally stable isotopes were employed to examine the processes involved in recharging aquifer systems and the changes in the groundwater chemistry caused by the interaction between the water and the aquifer matrix. Based on data derived from 113 groundwater wells, various tools and techniques, including stable environmental isotopes Oxygen-18 and Deuterium (δ18O and δD) for 33 samples and geochemical modeling with NETPATH, were used to evaluate the recharge mechanism and the evolution of the groundwater, combining GIS with hydrological and hydrochemical methods. The results revealed that groundwater from the Quaternary was the main source for irrigation; the water quality was categorized as relatively fresh to saline, with the total dissolved solids (TDSs) ranging from 261.3 to 8628.56 mg/L, exhibiting an average value of 2311.68 mg/L. The results of the environmental isotope analysis showed that the range of oxygen δ18O isotopes in the groundwater was from −5.65‰ to +0.39‰, while the range of hydrogen δD isotopes was from −32.60‰ to 4.73‰. Moreover, the δ18O–δD relationship indicated that the groundwater samples fell around the global meteoric precipitation line, showing a strong relationship, with a coefficient (R2) of approximately 0.82. The NETPATH model revealed that the dissolved chemical species within the groundwater system primarily originated from processes such as mineral weathering and dissolution, ion exchange, and evaporation.

In a hybrid microbial–inorganic catalysis system, H2 evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are coupled with microorganisms to achieve the highly efficient conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals using H2 as an electron mediator. However, currently developed HER electrocatalysts suffer from poor biocompatibility, hindering the performance of the system. This study presents a N- and Si-doped polythiophene nanocomposite (PTh-NSi) as a nonmetal HER electrocatalyst with biocompatibility for use in a hybrid microbial–inorganic catalysis system. By coupling PTh-NSi with Ralstonia eutropha H16, conversion of CO2 to poly-β-hydroxybutyrate with a maximum yield of 662.99 ± 27.46 mg/L was achieved. The PTh-NSi electrocatalyst demonstrated HER performance in bacterial media, minimal reactive oxygen species production, and no heavy metal ion leaching, ensuring biocompatibility with R. eutropha H16. The interactions between PTh-NSi and R. eutropha H16 were revealed. This work highlights an approach to designing biocompatible catalysts for hybrid microbial–inorganic catalysis systems, offering the potential for sustainable CO2 conversion.

Plants must effectively respond to various environmental stimuli to achieve optimal growth. This is especially relevant in the context of climate change, where drought emerges as a major factor globally impacting crops and limiting overall yield potential. Throughout evolution, plants have developed adaptative strategies for environmental stimuli, with plant hormones and reactive oxygen species (ROS) playing essential roles in their development. Hormonal signaling and the maintenance of ROS homeostasis are interconnected, playing indispensable roles in growth, development, and stress responses and orchestrating diverse molecular responses during environmental adversities. Nine principal classes of phytohormones have been categorized: auxins, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, and gibberellins primarily oversee developmental growth regulation, while abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and strigolactones are the main orchestrators of environmental stress responses. Coordination between phytohormones and transcriptional regulation is crucial for effective plant responses, especially in drought stress. Understanding the interplay of ROS and phytohormones is pivotal for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in plant stress responses. This review provides an overview of the intricate relationship between ROS, redox metabolism, and the nine different phytohormones signaling in plants, shedding light on potential strategies for enhancing drought tolerance for sustainable crop production.

Abstract The Systemic Evolutionary Theory of the Origin of Cancer (SETOC) is a recently proposed theory founded on two primary principles: the cooperative and endosymbiotic process of cell evolution as described by Lynn Margulis, and the integration of complex systems operating in eukaryotic cells, which is a core concept in systems biology. The SETOC proposes that malignant transformation occurs when cells undergo a continuous adaptation process in response to long-term injuries, leading to tissue remodeling, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately cancer. This process involves a maladaptive response, wherein the 'endosymbiotic contract’ between the nuclear-cytoplasmic system (derived from the primordial archaeal cell) and the mitochondrial system (derived from the primordial α-proteobacterium) gradually breaks down. This ultimately leads to uncoordinated behaviors and functions in transformed cells. The decoupling of the two cellular subsystems causes transformed cells to acquire phenotypic characteristics analogous to those of unicellular organisms, as well as certain biological features of embryonic development that are normally suppressed. These adaptive changes enable cancer cells to survive in the harsh tumor microenvironment characterized by low oxygen concentrations, inadequate nutrients, increased catabolic waste, and increased acidity. De-endosymbiosis reprograms the sequential metabolic functions of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This leads to increased lactate fermentation (Warburg effect), respiratory chain dysfunction, and TCA cycle reversal. Here, we present an updated version of the SETOC that incorporates the fundamental principles outlined by this theory and integrates the epistemological approach used to develop it.

The synthesis of micro-and nano-particles must be precisely controlled to achieve the desired shape and composition, as these characteristics profoundly influence their applicative efficacy. A large body of literature aims at constantly improving structure/function of these materials by refining synthesis procedures. Within it, a growing field of chemistry focuses on green synthesis methods to provide more sustainable alternatives while maintaining the bioactive efficiency of the particles. For instance, this Research Topic features a study on magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles synthesized using Azadirachta indica (neem) extract (Al-Harbi et al., 2024). The produced MgO nanoparticles exhibit remarkable stability under heat and in biological media, alongside notable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. Aligned with this search for greener processes and materials, another featured study reviews the development of silk fibroin-based scaffolds for tissue engineering (Ma et al., 2024). Silk, biosynthesized by over 200,000 arthropod species -including the Bombyx mori moth, whose silk is the most characterized -offers a rich source of fibroin, a natural biopolymer. Silk fibroin stands out for its mechanical strength, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and structural tunability. It can be used alone or combined with other materials to enhance cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.A focus in regenerative medicine consists in creating tissue alternatives to repair aging or diseased tissues and organs. It generally relies on the use of a scaffold for cell support. These scaffolds must meet precise guidelines to provide appropriate biomechanical and biochemical cues to facilitate cell adhesion and regulate phenotypic expression. Their conception thus requires control over shape, mechanical properties, and surface characteristics. The previously mentioned review on silk fibroin details the numerous possible processing techniques of this biomaterial (i.e. electrospinning, freeze-drying, solvent casting, gas foaming, particulate leaching, 3D printing) making it versatile and relevant for the repair of various tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, blood vessel, and nerves (Ma et al., 2024). Nano-and micro-structuration of scaffolds is another approach to enhance scaffold features as explored in this research topic in a study that showcases the incorporation of graphene oxide to the pure hardystonite (used for bone repair) leading to the obtention of a porous nano-and microstructured hardystonite/reduced graphene oxide composite (Bagherpour et al., 2023). The produced biomaterial demonstrates enhanced osteogenic differentiation and mechanical strength. An additional study focuses on the nanoscale properties of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), also employed in bone repair (Su et al., 2023). Granular-shaped BCP nanoparticles were synthesized, and the nanoscale texturing of these materials enhanced biocompatibility and osteogenic features. Importantly, they demonstrated immunomodulatory effects by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages, even under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions. The ability of BCP nanoparticles to restore osteogenesis impaired by inflammation underscores their dual role in promoting bone regeneration and modulating the immune response.Nanometer-scaled materials can provide stronger antibacterial features. The silver-copper bimetallic nanoparticles featured in this issue exemplify this strategy (Hao et al., 2024). Silver and copper nanoparticles have superior antibacterial effects compared to their bulk or micron-size counterparts. Furthermore, combining these nanomaterials rather than using them individually amplifies their antibacterial efficacy while minimizing cytotoxicity. These nanoparticles have dynamic interactions in biological environments through metal ions release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which collectively boost localized antibacterial activity, minimizing systemic side effects (Hao et al., 2024).Bioinspired MgO NPs also exhibited targeted effects. They show selective cytotoxicity against liver hepatic cancer cells in comparison to human umbilical vein endothelial ones, encouraging their potential in anticancer therapies (Al-Harbi et al., 2024). Additionally, they demonstrate significant antidiabetic activity through the inhibition of key enzymes like αglucosidase and α-amylase, along with robust anti-inflammatory effects via protein stabilization and cytokine regulation. Antioxidant activity is another critical aspect of bioactive particles. By scavenging free radicals, MgO NPs protect tissues from oxidative stress, a major contributor to inflammation and chronic diseases.Similarly, BCP nanomaterials have shown remarkable bioactivity. They mitigate inflammation in macrophages and enhance osteogenic processes by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and upregulating osteogenesis-related genes, such as Runx2 and OPN (Su et al., 2023). Notably, BCP nanoparticles can reverse the detrimental effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions on osteoblast activity. This dual functionality makes BCP nanoparticles promising candidates for applications in environments where inflammation impedes bone regeneration.The integration of micro-and nano-particles into regenerative medicine can not only support tissue regeneration but also actively engage in therapeutic processes. While these versatile biomaterials hold large promises, challenges still remain for their widespread adoption in the clinic. Among them, the assessment of long-term biocompatibility requires monitoring biomaterial evolution over years. It is a complex task, yet necessary, as these materials are designed to interact with biological systems over extended periods. Another challenge concerns their integration with advanced manufacturing, such as 3D printing, as well as the scalability and reproducibility of their manufacturing. This is necessary to ensure consistent production of high-quality particles for large-scale applications. In parallel to these technical hurdles come regulatory and translational barriers. However, as this field progresses and with sustained efforts to overcome these obstacles, we are optimistic that micro-and nanoparticles can pave the way for more effective medical solutions.

Metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) breast cancer often develops resistance to first-line treatment, typically combining cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with hormone therapy (HT) [1, 2]. After an initial response, most patients become resistant, and compensatory mechanisms are not fully uncovered [3]. To address this, we analyzed HR+ resistant CAMA1 and 747D cells using whole-exome and RNA sequencing, supplemented by proteomics and target validation with human samples. Additionally, we conducted combination therapy trials using xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Detailed study designs and methods are provided in the Supplementary file. In a cohort of 27 patients with metastatic breast cancer, we observed reduced progression-free survival in second- and third-line therapies following progression post palbociclib-HT treatment (Supplementary Figure S1A and Supplementary Table S1). Resistant tumors showed reduced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and progesterone receptor (PR) and increased proliferation rates (Supplementary Figure S1B-D). CAMA1 and T47D cells, treated with palbociclib and fulvestrant (PF) for 2 years, developed resistance (CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR) confirmed by proliferation assays and elevated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. Resistant cells exhibited reduced levels of ERα and retinoblastoma protein (Supplementary Figure S2). Exome analysis revealed no drug resistance-related mutations (Supplementary Tables S2-S3), suggesting non-genetic factors. RNA sequencing of T47D cells treated with DMSO or PF for 20 days and T47D-PFR cells revealed 1,172 upregulated genes and 824 downregulated genes in the resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). Gene set enrichment analysis indicated increased fatty acid localization (Supplementary Figure S3B), with a heatmap showing elevated fatty acid uptake and metabolism-related genes, such as fatty acid binding protein-6 (FABP6), FABP7, cluster of differentiation-36 (CD36), and proteasome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in T47D-PFR cells (Figure 1A). Lipid droplets accumulated in PF-treated parental and PF-resistant T47D and CAMA1 cells (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S3C). FABP6 levels were elevated in PF-treated parental and PF-resistant cells, with CD36 overexpression unique to T47D-PFR cells at both protein and mRNA levels (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S3D-E), suggesting that lipid uptake might be an adaptive response to oxidative stress [4, 5]. This was supported by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in PF-treated parental cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, proteomic analysis in human biopsies revealed a functional network of 11 oxidative stress-triggered proteasomes (Supplementary Figure S4A and Supplementary Tables S4-S5) as indicators of oxidative stress [6]. Immunohistochemistry validated increased proteasome subunit alpha type-7 (PSMA7) in resistant biopsies (Supplementary Figure S4B). Ferroptosis inducers overcome resistance of HR+HER2− breast cancer cells to palbociclib-hormone therapy. (A) Heatmap of upregulated genes (red) or downregulated genes (blue) during the treatment of T47D cells with PF combination for 20 days, and in PF-resistant cells (T47D-PFR) after continuous PF treatment for 2 years, compared to parental T47D cells treated with vehicle (DMSO).

Continuous PF treatment for resistant cells was discontinued 3 days prior to the assay. (H) Assessment of cell proliferation according to the fold change in confluence in parental and PF-resistant CAMA1 and T47D cells treated with different combinations of DMSO, palbociclib (P) (0.3 µmol/L), fulvestrant (F) (30 nmol/L), or eprenetapopt (Ep) (25 µmol/L) for 7 days.

The difference between the measured tumor volumes was significant between the "vehicle" group and the eprenetapopt + fulvestrant + palbociclib (FPE) group from Day 25 until the end of the experiment (P < 0.05). Tumor evolution formula is (Vf − V0 / V0) × 100%, where V0 is the initial volume and Vf is the final volume measured at each time point.

We investigated whether cell survival is affected by ferroptosis—a type of non-apoptotic cell death linked to lipid peroxidation. GPX4 protein, the main protector against ferroptosis, was overexpressed in parental cells after PF treatment and in PF-resistant cells, even after drug wash-out, with no changes in mRNA levels (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure S5A-C). Silencing GPX4 expression reduced cell proliferation in parental and PF-resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S5D-F), indicating their reliance on GPX4. GPX4 overexpression was also observed in resistant human tumors (Figure 1F). Cells were treated with the GPX4 inhibitor RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) and the antioxidant Trolox for 6 days. CAMA1 and T47D cells were insensitive to RSL3, whereas CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells showed high sensitivity to RSL3 (Figure 1G). Trolox reversed RSL3's effect in both cell lines (Figure 1G), highlighting the role of GPX4 in PF-resistant cell proliferation. Due to unverified safety of RLS3, we used eprenetapopt (Ep), a p53 activator and GSH depletory [7] proven safe in hematological cancer patients [8]. In vitro, CAMA1 and CAMA1-PFR cells were sensitive to Ep, while T47D cells were insensitive; T47D-PFR showed higher sensitivity (Figure 1H). To investigate the effect of pharmacologically induced ferroptosis on the palbociclib-fulvestrant response in vivo, we used nude mice implanted with estrogen pellets. Due to its low pharmacokinetics in mouse plasma [9], RSL3 was administered via intratumoral injection. Mice were treated with vehicle, PF, Ep, RSL3, a combination of palbociclib-fulvestrant and eprenetapopt (PFEp), or a combination of palbociclib-fulvestrant and RSL3 (PF-RSL3). PF effectively inhibited the growth of the CAMA1 xenografts, while CAMA1-PFR tumors were insensitive (Figure 1I and J). RSL3 alone did not affect CAMA1-PFR tumor growth, whereas PF-RSL3 demonstrated a strong antitumor effect (Figure 1J), suggesting that RSL3 sensitizes CAMA1-PFR cells to PF, or vice versa. Similarly, Ep alone did not inhibit CAMA1-PFR tumor growth, but its combination with PF completely abolished tumor growth (Figure 1J). To evaluate treatment effects on proliferation and cell death, we assessed Ki67, caspase-3 and hydroxynonenal (HNE) in tumors by immunohistochemistry. Parental CAMA1 tumors treated with PF showed a significant decrease in Ki67, with no effect on caspase-3, while CAMA1-PFR tumors exhibited no significant changes in either marker after treatment with PF, PFEp, or PF-RSL3 (Supplementary Figure S6A-D). HNE labeling revealed no difference between PF- and vehicle-treated CAMA1 tumors (Supplementary Figure S6E), but HNE increased moderately in CAMA1-PFR tumors treated with RSL3 and significantly with PFEp or PF-RSL3 (Supplementary Figure S6F), indicating potential cell death by ferroptosis. No treatments affected CD36 expression in either tumor type, although CAMA1-PFR xenografts showed significantly increased basal expression compared to human biopsies (Supplementary Figure S6G-J). To strengthen the translational impact of our findings, we used patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from HR+HER2− breast cancer patients without p53 mutations (Supplementary Figure S7A) [10]. Consistent with human samples, GPX4 protein was upregulated in the palbociclib-HT-resistant PDX model (HBCx-180) compared to the palbociclib-HT-naïve PDX model (HBCx-124) (Supplementary Figure S7B). While GPX4 mRNA levels were unaffected in resistant cells, its expression was significantly higher in HBCx-180 (Supplementary Figure S7C), suggesting specific transcriptional/translational regulation differing between in vitro and in vivo contexts. In the HBCx-124 model, all the tumors (n = 5) responded well to PF, with no added benefit from Ep (PFEp), although a partial response to Ep monotherapy was observed (Figure 1K). Conversely, the HBCx-180 model showed no significant response to PF or Ep, with significant differences in tumor volumes between PFEp and vehicle and Ep groups from Day 25 onward (P < 0.05) (Figure 1L). These results confirm that adding Ep to PF in PF-resistant tumors produces a strong antitumor effect. Ki67 labeling decreased with PF in the HBCx-124 PDX but not in the HBCx-180 PDX (Supplementary Figure S8A-B). Aside from reduction in caspase-3 labeling in the HBCx-124 treated with PF, no significant changes were observed with Ep or PFEp, and none of the treatment conditions affected HBCx-180 (Supplementary Figure S8C-D), indicating that proliferation and apoptosis are not affected in HBCx-180. HNE labeling suggested that PF promoted ferroptosis in HBCx-124, while only tumors treated with PFEp in HBCx-180 exhibited significant HNE increase compared to vehicle (Supplementary Figure S8E-F). PF slightly increased HNE in HBCx-124 without significance but the only vulnerability of HBCx-180 is attributed to ferroptosis induced with PFEp. The p53-dependent antitumor effect of eprenetapopt was excluded, as p53 expression was similar in parental and PF-resistant cells and in PDXs, while slightly elevated in resistant human tumors (Supplementary Figure S9). Finally, the addition of Ep or RSL3 to PF did not induce significant renal, hepatic, or hematological toxicity in mice (Supplementary Figure S10). In conclusion, HR+HER2− tumors resistant to palbociclib-HT are vulnerable to ferroptosis inducers, highlighting the potential of collateral drug sensitivity and the promise of developing pro-ferroptosis agents for treating drug-resistant metastatic breast cancer (Supplementary Figure S11).
