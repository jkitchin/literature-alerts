The development of advanced electrolysis technologies such as anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is central to the vision of a sustainable energy future. Key to the realization of such AEMWE technology lies in the exploration of low‐cost and high‐efficient catalysts for facilitating the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite tremendous efforts in the fundamental research, most of today’s OER works are conducted under room temperature, which deviates significantly with AEMWE’s operating temperature (50–80 °C). To bridge this gap, it is highly desirable to obtain insights into the OER catalytic behavior at elevated temperatures. Herein, using the well‐known perovskite catalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) as a proof of concept, the effect of temperature on the variation in OER catalytic activity and stability is evaluated. It is found that the BSCF’s activity increases with increasing temperature due to enhanced lattice oxygen participation promoting the lattice oxygen‐mediated OER process. Further, surface amorphization and cation leaching of BSCF become more pronounced as temperature increases, causing a somewhat attenuated OER stability. These new understandings of the fundamental OER catalysis over perovskite materials at industrial‐relevant temperature conditions are expected to have strong implications for the research of OER catalysts to be deployed in practical water electrolyzers.

Nitrogen doped leather waste-derived carbon materials have been employed as eletrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. Low current densities and complex synthesis routes of other carbon-based materials limit their practical applicability. We present herein a simple and cost-competitive design of a metal free nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NCM). At 10 mA cm−2 of current density, the assembled NCM showed a low over potential of 330 mV. NCM provided 73 mV dec-1 of slope value according to Tafel analysis, with NCM slope value improved as compared to previously described electrocatalysts inclusive of graphene (113 mV dec−1) and carbon nanosheets (101 mV dec−1), under similar reaction conditions. Linear sweep voltamogram, stability test and electrochemical impedance spectra confirmed the potential of NCM in OER as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst.

Trimetallic catalysts exhibit potential for functional complementarity and synergistic interactions, rendering them promising for catalyzing reactions involving multi-intermediates. However, achieving a uniform dispersion of all three metal species at the single-atom level continues to pose a significant challenge. In this work, a metal encapsulation-interlayer stacking strategy is developed to prepare FeCoNi@NC triple single-atom catalysts. Benefiting from the synergistic interplay among the M-NX (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) active sites, the FeCoNi@NC TACs demonstrate superior bifunctional catalytic efficacy in alkaline solutions, with a half-wave potential reaching 0.878 V (vs. RHE) and a minimal overpotential of 285 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable ORR performance in acidic environments, achieving a half-wave potential of 0.814 V (vs. RHE). DFT calculations elucidate that an elevated d-band center enhances the adsorption of reactive intermediates at the Fe-N4 and Co-N4 sites, consequently augmenting ORR and OER activities. This study delineates a direct and effective methodology for the synthesis of high-performance and durable trimetallic single atom MNC ORR/OER catalysts for Zn-air batteries.

Abstract The discovery of non‐precious catalysts for replacing the precious metal of ruthenium in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a key step in reducing the cost of green hydrogen production. The 2D d ‐MHOFs, a new 2D materials with controllable oxygen vacancies formed by controlling the degree of coordination bridging between metal hydroxyl oxide and BDC ligands are synthesized at room temperature, exhibit excellent OER properties with low overpotentials of 207 mV at 10 mA cm −2 . High‐resolution transmission electron microscopy images and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the introduction of oxygen vacancy sites leads to a lattice distortion and charge redistribution in the catalysts, enhancing the OER activity of 2D d ‐MHOFs comprehensively. Synchrotron radiation and in situ Raman/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that part of oxygen defect sites on the surface of 2D d ‐MHOFs are prone to transition to highly active metal hydroxyl oxides during the OER process. This work provides a mild strategy for scalable preparation of 2D d ‐MHOFs nanosheets with controllable oxygen defects, reveals the relationship between oxygen vacancies and OER performance, and offers a profound insight into the basic process of structural transformation in the OER process.

Water electrolysis driven by “green electricity“ is an ideal technology to realize energy conversion and store renewable energy into hydrogen. With the development of proton exchange membrane (PEM), water electrolysis in acidic media suitable for many situations with an outstanding advantage of high gas purity has attracted significant attention. Compared with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kinetic sluggish process that needs a higher overpotential. Especially in acidic media, OER process poses higher requirements for the electrocatalysts, such as high efficiency, high stability and low costs. This review focuses on the acidic OER electrocatalysis, reaction mechanisms, and critical parameters used to evaluate performance. Especially the modification strategies applied in the design and construction of new‐type electrocatalysts are also summarized. The characteristics of traditional noble metal‐based electrocatalysts and the noble metal‐free electrocatalysts developed in recent decades are compared and discussed. Finally, the current challenges for the most promising acidic OER electrocatalysts are presented, together with a perspective for future water electrolysis.

Electrocatalytic water splitting is a sustainable way to produce hydrogen energy. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode always has sluggish kinetics and low energy conversion efficiency, which is the major bottleneck for water splitting. In this paper, the electronic structure of the Co3O4/carbon composites was regulated by anion doping. The F-doped carbon substrate is compounded with ZIF-67, and the active component Co3O4 is encapsulated in the skeleton formed by ZIF-67. The prepared hybrid nanocomposite catalyst F-Co3O4@NF has excellent OER performance. It requires an overpotential of only 172 mV with the current density of 50 mA cm-2, and the Tafel slope is 88 mV dec-1. It can maintain good stability after 24 hours of continuous operation, and the catalytic activity exceeds most of the similar series of catalysts. The characterization show that F doping can affect the catalytic activity in the form of adjusting the electronic structure and lifting d band center. These structural changes effectively optimize the adsorption/desorption capacity of the composite catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen intermediates in the catalytic process, thereby improving the catalytic activity for alkaline oxygen evolution.

Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for future renewable energy technology. Here, we use first-principles calculations combined with genetic algorithm to determine the structures of various Pd clusters supported on experimentally available C2N monolayer and evaluate the OER and ORR performance. Our findings show that the activity of the supported Pd clusters is closely linked to the local geometrical and electronic structure of the active site. Furthermore, we establish the activity trends of the clusters based on the adsorption free energies of intermediates. In particular, C2N supported Pd7 and Pd8 clusters exhibit outstanding OER activity with low overpotentials. We identify a volcano relation for the OER on the clusters, suggesting that the high activity of the cluster is related to the moderate adsorption strength of intermediates. Mechanistic analysis indicates that the second water formation is the potential-determining step for ORR on the clusters due to the strong adsorption of *OH. Additionally, we identify a linear scaling relationship between the ORR overpotentials and adsorption free energies of *OH, demonstrating that reducing the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on Pd clusters can improve the activity. This work unravels the activity trends of cluster catalysts and provides strategies for the rational design of highly efficient single-cluster catalysts for OER and ORR.

Electrocatalysts with high activity and long-term durability are vital toward large-scale hydrogen production from electrocatalytic water splitting. Here, the self-supported electrode (FeOxHy@Ni3B/NF) with hierarchical heterostructure was simply prepared by using Ni3B chunks grown on nickel foam as substrate to in situ form vertical FeOxHy nanosheets. Such hybrid shows efficient oxygen evolution reaction activity with overpotentials as low as 267 and 249 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution and 30 wt% KOH solution, respectively. Meanwhile, it also exhibits excellent catalytic stability, sustaining catalysis at 500 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution for 200 h, and even for 200 h at 1000 mA cm−2 in 30 wt% KOH solution. Further experimental results reveal that the FeOxHy@Ni3B/NF is endowed with superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface properties, which not only provide more mass transport channels, as well as facilitated the diffusion of reaction intermediates and gas bubbles. Also, it holds faster reaction kinetics, more accessible active sites and accelerated electron transfer rates due to strong synergistic interactions at the heterogeneous interface.

Design the electrocatalysts without noble metal is still a challenge for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media. Herein, we reported the manganese doping method to decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancy (Vo) and form the Mn−O structure adjacent octahedral sites in spinel NiCo2O4−δ (NiMn1.5Co3O4−δ), which highly enhanced the activity and stability of spinel NiCo2O4−δ with a low overpotential (η) of 280 mV at j = 10 mA cm−2 and long‐term stability of 80 h in acid media. The isotopic labelling experiment based on differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) clearly demonstrated the lattice oxygen in NiMn1.5Co3O4−δ is more stable due to strong Mn‐O bond and synergetic adsorbate evolution mechanism (SAEM) for acid OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal highly increased oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVO) of NiCo2O4−δ after Mn doping. More importantly, the highly hydrogen bonding between Mn−O and *OOH adsorbed on adjacent Co octahedral sites promote the formation of *OO from *OOH due to the greatly enhanced charge density of O in Mn substituted sites.

Abstract Organic supramolecular photocatalysts have garnered widespread attention due to their adjustable structure and exceptional photocatalytic activity. Herein, a novel bis‐dicarboxyphenyl‐substituent naphthalenediimide self‐assembly supramolecular photocatalyst (SA‐NDI‐BCOOH) with efficient dual‐functional photocatalytic performance is successfully constructed. The large molecular dipole moment and short‐range ordered stacking structure of SA‐NDI‐BCOOH synergistically create a giant internal electric field (IEF), resulting in a remarkable 6.7‐fold increase in its charge separation efficiency. Additionally, the tetracarboxylic structure of SA‐NDI‐BCOOH greatly enhances its hydrophilicity. Thus, SA‐NDI‐BCOOH demonstrates efficient dual‐functional activity for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution, with rates of 372.8 and 3.8 µmol h −1 , respectively. Meanwhile, a notable apparent quantum efficiency of 10.86% at 400 nm for hydrogen evolution is achieved, prominently surpassing many reported supramolecular photocatalysts. More importantly, with the help of dual co‐catalysts, it exhibits photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H 2 and O 2 evolution rates of 3.2 and 1.6 µmol h −1 . Briefly, this work sheds light on enhancing the IEF by controlling the molecular polarity and stacking structure to dramatically improve the photocatalytic performance of supramolecular materials.

Abstract Merely all transition‐metal‐based materials reconstruct into similar oxyhydroxides during the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), severely limiting the options for a tailored OER catalyst design. In such reconstructions, initial constituent p‐block elements take a sacrificial role and leach into the electrolyte as oxyanions, thereby losing the ability to tune the catalyst's properties systematically. From a thermodynamic point of view, indium is expected to behave differently and should remain in the solid phase under alkaline OER conditions. However, the structural behavior of transition metal indium phases during the OER remains unexplored. Herein, are synthesized intermetallic cobalt indium (CoIn 3 ) nanoparticles and revealed by in situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission microscopy that they undergo phase segregation to cobalt oxyhydroxide and indium hydroxide. The obtained cobalt oxyhydroxide outperforms a metallic‐cobalt‐derived one due to more accessible active sites. The observed phase segregation shows that indium behaves distinctively differently from most p‐block elements and remains at the electrode surface, where it can form lasting interfaces with the active metal oxo phases.
