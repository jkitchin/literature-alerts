Bioinspired, self-assembled hybrid materials show great potential in the field of energy conversion. Here, we have prepared a sonication-induced boladipeptide (HO-YF-AA-FY-OH (PBFY); AA = Adipic acid, F = l-phenylalanine, and Y = l-tyrosine) and an anchored, self-assembled nickel-based coordinated polymeric nanohybrid hydrogel (Ni-PBFY). The morphological studies of hydrogels PBFY and Ni-PBFY exhibit nanofibrillar network structures. XPS analysis has been used to study the self-assembled coordinated polymeric hydrogel Ni-PBFY-3, with the aim of identifying its chemical makeup and electronic state. XANES and EXAFS analyses have been used to examine the local electronic structure and coordination environment of Ni-PBFY-3. The xerogel of Ni-PBFY was used to fabricate the electrodes and is utilized in the OER (oxygen evolution reaction). The native hydrogel (PBFY) contains a gelator boladipeptide of 15.33 mg (20 mmol L

Efficient production of green hydrogen energy is crucial in addressing the energy crisis and environmental concerns. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses a challenge in conventional overall water electrolysis due to its slow thermodynamically process. Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers an alternative anodic oxidation method that is highly efficient and cost-effective, with favorable thermodynamics and sustainability. Recently, there has been limited research on bifunctional catalysts that exhibit excellent activity for both OER and UOR reactions. In this study, we developed a selenium and iron co-doped nickel sulfide (SeFe-Ni3S2) catalyst that demonstrated excellent Tafel slopes of 53.9 mV dec−1 and 16.4 mV dec−1 for OER and UOR, respectively. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the introduction of metal (iron) and nonmetallic elements (selenium) was found to coordinate the d-band center, resulting in improved adsorption/desorption energies of the catalysts and reduced the overpotentials and limiting potentials for OER and UOR, respectively. This activity enhancement can be attributed to the altered electronic coordination structure after the introduction of selenium (Se) and iron (Fe), leading to an increase in the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. This work offers a new strategy for bifunctional catalysts for OER and UOR, presenting new possibilities for the future development of hydrogen production and novel energy conversion technologies It contributes towards the urgent search for technologies that efficiently produce green hydrogen energy, providing potential solutions to mitigate the energy crisis and protect the environment.

The exploration of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high activity and acceptable price is essential for water splitting to hydrogen generation. High-entropy materials (HEMs) have aroused increasing interest in the field of electrocatalysis due to their unusual physicochemical properties. In this work, we reported a novel FeCoNiMoZn-OH high entropy hydroxide (HEH)/nickel foam (NF) synthesized by a facile pulsed electrochemical deposition method at room temperature. The FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH displays a 3D porous nanosheet morphology and polycrystalline structure, which exhibits extraordinary OER activity in alkaline media, including much lower overpotential (248 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope (30 mV dec−1). Furthermore, FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH demonstrates excellent OER catalytic stability. The enhanced catalytic performance of the FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH primarily contributed to the porous morphology and the positive synergistic effect between Mo and Zn. This work provides a novel insight into the design of HEMs in catalytic application.

ABSTRACT. There is a growing need to develop catalysts based on non-precious metals for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the various catalysts comprising multiple transition metals, nickel (Ni)-iron (Fe) selenides have gained considerable attention due to their promising catalytic activity, attributed to their distinct metal-like characteristics. Although a lot of studies have focused on the dissolution of selenium (Se) under alkaline OER conditions and its consequent in-situ reconstructing impact, little attention has been paid to the possible involvement of Se itself in OER. In this work, we focus on the small amounts of Se residues that remain after dissolution. Our findings suggest that the quantity of these residues directly influences the OER activity of the Fe active sites within NiFe selenides. These residues are presented on the surface in the form of SeOx.

Unraveling the catalyst surface structure and behavior during reactions is essential for both mechanistic understanding and performance optimization. Here we report a phenomenon of facet-dependent surface restructuring intrinsic to β-Ni(OH)2 catalysts during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), discovered by the correlative ex situ and operando characterization. The ex situ study after OER reveals β-Ni(OH)2 restructuring at the edge facets to form nanoporous Ni1–xO, which is Ni deficient containing Ni3+ species. Operando liquid transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy further identify the active role of the intermediate β-NiOOH phase in both the OER catalysis and Ni1–xO formation, pinpointing the complete surface restructuring pathway. Such surface restructuring is shown to effectively increase the exposed active sites, accelerate Ni oxidation kinetics, and optimize *OH intermediate bonding energy toward fast OER kinetics, which leads to an extraordinary activity enhancement of ∼16-fold. Facilitated by such a self-activation process, the specially prepared β-Ni(OH)2 with larger edge facets exhibits a 470-fold current enhancement than that of the benchmark IrO2, demonstrating a promising way to optimize metal-(oxy)hydroxide-based catalysts.

The utilization of water electrolysis for green hydrogen (H2) production, powered by renewable energy, is a promising avenue for sustainable development. Proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) stands out as one of the most efficient H2 production technologies. However, implementing it on an industrial scale faces substantial challenges, particularly regarding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER, a critical process with inherently slow kinetics requiring additional potential, significantly influences overall water-splitting efficiency. Most OER electrocatalysts in PEMWE struggle with poor stability in harsh acidic environments at high oxidative potentials. While rare-earth metal oxides, such as iridium or ruthenium oxides, offer stability in commercial oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts (OECs), their use depends on achieving economically and sustainably viable operations. An alternative approach involves developing low- or non-noble metal-based OECs with sustaining high activity and long-term durability. Although such materials currently exhibit lower activity and stability than noble-based OECs, notable progress has been made in enhancing their performance. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in designing acidic-stable OECs based on low or without noble metal contents. It delves into the thermodynamics and degradation mechanisms of OECs in acidic media, evaluation parameters for activity and stability, strategies for developing active and acid-stable OECs, and the challenges and opportunities of acid water electrolysis. Through a detailed analysis of these aspects, the review aims to identify opportunities for engineering actively durable OECs.

<p>Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can convert renewable energy into hydrogen through water electrolysis. Identifying stable and active single-atom catalysts (SACs) for OER under acidic conditions holds great promise for developing cost-effective and efficient energy storage solutions, but challenging due to the vast number of potential material compositions and diverse surface morphologies. Here, to accelerate new discoveries, we present a high-throughput screening (HTS) framework that leverages the power of machine learning (ML) and density functional theory (DFT). The proposed framework includes an assessment of both the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of support surfaces. In addition, the integration of ML and uncertainty quantification for predicting the binding energies dramatically reduces the computational cost (by over a factor of 10), facilitating the identification of catalytically active SACs. Following the proposed scheme, we suggest 14 new promising SACs for OER across the 795 binary oxide supports and 21 transition metal atom combinations. These catalysts are found to break the scaling relation due to the enhanced *OOH binding with the support, which arises from favorable hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>

Abstract Understanding the structure‐activity correlation is an important prerequisite for the rational design of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts at the atomic level. However, the effect of coordination environment on electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains enigmatic. In this work, the regulation of proton transfer involved in water oxidation by coordination engineering based on Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2 and CoHPO 4 is reported. The HPO 4 2− anion has intermediate p K a value between Co(II)‐H 2 O and Co(III)‐H 2 O to be served as an appealing proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) induction group. From theoretical calculations, the pH‐dependent OER properties, deuterium kinetic isotope effects, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Raman studies, the CoHPO 4 catalyst beneficially reduces the energy barrier of proton hopping and modulates the formation energy of high‐valent Co species, thereby enhancing OER activity. This work demonstrates a promising strategy that involves tuning the local coordination environment to optimize PCET steps and electrocatalytic activities for electrochemical applications. In addition, the designed system offers a motif to understand the structure‐efficiency relationship from those amino‐acid residue with proton buffer ability in natural photosynthesis.

NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) with abundant heterostructures represents a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, NiFe LDH/Fe2O3 nanosheet arrays have been fabricated by facile combustion of corrosion-engineered NiFe foam (NFF). The in situ grown, self-supported electrocatalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 248 mV for the OER at 50 mA cm–2, a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec–1, and excellent durability over 100 h under the industrial benchmarking 500 mA cm–2 current density. A balanced Ni and Fe composition under optimal corrosion and combustion contributed to the desirable electrochemical properties. Comprehensive ex-situ analyses and operando characterizations including Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTACV) and in situ Raman demonstrate the beneficial role of modulated interfacial electron transfer, dynamic atomic structural transformation to NiOOH, and the high-valence active metal sites. This study provides a low-cost and easy-to-expand way to synthesize efficient and durable electrocatalysts.

Reasonable design and development of non-precious metal Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with high efficiency, low cost and stability are of great significance for electrocatalytic water splitting. The unique molecular structure and exceptional properties of polyoxometalates (POMs) have caught significant attention from the scientific community. Herein, CoMo-POM@IF nanoflowers has been successfully synthesized by facile etching iron foam (IF) at room temperature using polyoxometalates (POMs) as a precursor. POMs as a carbon-free metal-oxygen clusters with unique structural characteristics can be uniformly nucleated at room temperature, which can not only enable efficient green synthesis, but also provide a clear source of catalytic activity. CoMo-POM@IF catalysts with perfect nanoflake layer structure are obtained with the optimal reaction time, and the embedding of POM nanoparticles increased the surface roughness to expose more active sites. The embedding of POMs nanoparticles increases the surface roughness and electrochemically active area, showing great advantages in OER. An overpotential of 282 mV is measured at a current density of 10 mA·cm-2 in 1 M KOH, showing long-term electrochemical stability. The green synthesis of POMs electrocatalyst provides great ideas for the development of room temperature oxygen evolution electrocatalyst and speeds up the development of OER electrocatalyst in the actual production.

Development of cost-effective catalysts that provide low overpotentials and enhanced electrochemical kinetics is a critical goal of contemporary research on electrochemical water splitting and similar technologically significant processes. Translation to practical applications demands that they should also enable high current densities to be ex-tracted. A simple strategy of encapsulating the active electrocatalyst in hydrogel polymer matrices is shown to provide a solution in several respects, especially regarding the last criterion. The concept is illustrated using two examples of ‘gelectrodes’ based on nanocomposites of cobalt oxyhydroxide and nickel-iron hydroxide with chitosan on nickel foam, and their efficient mediation of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Comparison with various control systems show that significantly lower overpotentials and higher current densities with extended temporal stability can be achieved with the gelectrodes; the cobalt oxyhydroxide - chitosan and nickel-iron hydroxide - chitosan systems provide stable current densities up to 1.6 - 1.7 A cm-2 for the OER with alkaline aqueous electrolyte. This simple design strategy is expected to open up a general route to technologically useful electrocatalyst performance.

Abstract Catalysts for zinc‐air batteries (ZABs) must be stable over long‐term charging‐discharging cycles and exhibit bifunctional catalytic activity. In this study, by doping nitrogen‐doped carbon (NC) materials with three metal atoms (Fe, Ni, and Cu), a single‐atom‐distributed FeNiCu‐NC bifunctional catalyst is prepared. The catalyst includes Fe(Ni‐doped)‐N 4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Fe(Cu‐doped)‐N 4 for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and the NiCu‐NC catalytic structure for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the nitrogen‐doped carbon nanoparticles. This single‐atom distribution catalyst structure enhances the bifunctional catalytic activity. If a trimetallic single‐atom catalyst is designed, it will surpass the typical bimetallic single‐atom catcalyst. FeNiCu‐NC exhibits outstanding performance as an electrocatalyst, with a half‐wave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 0.876 V versus RHE, overpotential ( E j = 10 ) of 253 mV versus RHE at 10 mA cm −2 , and a small potential gap ( ΔE = 0.61 V). As the anode in a ZAB, FeNiCu‐NC can undergo continuous charge‐discharged cycles for 575 h without significant attenuation. This study presents a new method for achieving high‐performance, low‐cost ZABs via trimetallic single‐atom doping.

Abstract Direct electrolysis of seawater to generate hydrogen is an attractive approach for storing renewable energy. However, direct seawater splitting suffers from low current density and limited operating stability, which severely hinders its industrialization. Herein, a promising strategy is reported to obtain a nano needle‐like array catalyst‐CDs‐Mn‐Co x P on nickel foam, in which the Mn─O─C bond tightly binds Mn, Carbon dots (CDs), and Co x P together. The coordination engineering of CDs and Mn not only effectively regulates the electronic structure of Co x P, but also endows the as‐prepared catalyst with selectivity and marked long‐term stability at ampere‐level current density. Low overpotentials of 208 and 447 mV are required to achieve 1000 mA cm −2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in simulated seawater, respectively. Cell potentials of 1.78 and 1.86 V are needed to reach 500 and 1000 mA cm −2 in alkaline seawater along with excellent durability for 350 h. DFT studies have verified that the introduction of Mn and CDs effectively shifts the d‐band center of Co‐3d toward higher energy, thereby strengthening the adsorption of intermediates and enhancing the catalytic activity. This study sheds light on the development of highly effective and stable catalysts for large‐scale seawater electrolysis.

Abstract As a promising alternative to Ir based acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, Ru suffers from severe fading issues. Supporting it on robust oxides such as TiO2 is a simple and effective way to enhance its lifetime. Here, we find that a simple reduction-oxidation process can further improve both activity and stability of RuO2-TiO2 composites at high potentials. In this process, the degree of oxidation was carefully controlled to form Ru/RuO2 heterostructure to improve OER activity. Moreover, due to the oxophilicity difference of Ru and Ti, the structure of catalysts was changed from supported to embedded, which enhanced the protective effect of TiO2 and mitigated the dissolution of Ru element in acidic electrolyte, making as-prepared Ru/RuO2-TiO2 with better durability at all tested potentials.

Ozonation water treatment technology has attracted increasing attention due to its environmental benign and high efficiency. Rutile PbO2 is a promising anode material for electrochemical ozone production (EOP). However, the reaction mechanism underlying ozone production catalyzed by PbO2 was rarely studied and not well‐understood, which was in part due to the overlook of the electrochemistry‐driven formation of oxygen vacancy (OV) of PbO2. Herein, we unrevealed the origin of the EOP activity of PbO2 starting from the electrochemical surface state analysis using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, activity analysis, and catalytic volcano modeling. Interestingly, we found that under experimental EOP potential (i.e., a potential around 2.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), OV can still be generated easily on PbO2 surfaces. Our subsequent kinetic and thermodynamic analyses show that these OV sites on PbO2 surfaces are highly active for the EOP reaction through an interesting atomic oxygen (O*)‐O2 coupled mechanism. In particular, rutile PbO2(101) with the “in‐situ” generated OV exhibited superior EOP activities, outperforming (111) and (110). Finally, by catalytic modeling, we found that PbO2 is close to the theoretical optimum of the reaction, suggesting a superior EOP performance of rutile PbO2. All these analyses are in good agreement with experimental observations.

The continuous dissolution and oxidation of active sites in Ru-based electrocatalysts have greatly hindered their practical application in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). In this work, we first used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the dissolution energy of Ru in the 3d transition metal-doped MRuOx (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) to evaluate their stability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and screen out ZnRuOx as the best candidate. To confirm the theoretical predictions, we experimentally synthesized these MRuOx materials and found that ZnRuOx indeed displays robust acidic OER stability with a negligible decay of η10 after 15 000 CV cycles. Of importance, using ZnRuOx as the anode, the PEMWE can run stably for 120 h at 200 mA cm–2. We also further uncover the stability mechanism of ZnRuOx, i.e., Zn atoms doped in the outside of ZnRuOx nanocrystal would form a "Zn-rich" shell, which effectively shortened average Ru–O bond lengths in ZnRuOx to strengthen the Ru–O interaction and therefore boosted intrinsic stability of ZnRuOx in acidic OER. In short, this work not only provides a new study paradigm of using DFT calculations to guide the experimental synthesis but also offers a proof-of-concept with 3d metal dopants as RuO2 stabilizer as a universal principle to develop high-durability Ru-based catalysts for PEMWE.

Transition metal tungstates (TMTs) possess a wolframite-like lattice structure and preferably form via an electrostatic interaction between a divalent transition metal cation (MII) and an oxyanion of tungsten ([WO4]2–). A unit cell of a TMT is primarily composed of two repeating units, [MO6]oh and [WO6]oh, which are held together via several M−μ2–O–W bridging links. The bond character (ionic or covalent) of this bridging unit determines the stability of the lattice and influences the electronic structure of the bulk TMT materials. Recently, TMTs have been successfully employed as an electrode material for various applications, including electrochemical water splitting. Despite the wide electrocatalytic applications of TMTs, the study of the structure–activity correlation and electronic factors responsible for in situ structural evolution to electroactive species during electrochemical reactions is still in its infancy. Herein, a series of TMTs, MIIWVIO4 (M = Mn/Fe/Co/Ni), have been prepared and employed as electrocatalysts to study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions and to scrutinize the role of transition metals in controlling the energetics of the formation of electroactive species. Since the [WO6]oh unit is common in the TMTs considered, the variation of the central atom of the corresponding [MO6]oh unit plays an intriguing role in controlling the electronic structure and stability of the lattice under anodic potential. Under the OER conditions, a potential-dependent structural transformation of MWO4 is noticed, where MnWO4 appears to be the most labile, whereas NiWO4 is stable up to a high anodic potential of ∼1.68 V (vs RHE). Potential-dependent hydrolytic [WO4]2– dissolution to form MOx active species, traced by in situ Raman and various spectro-/microscopic analyses, can directly be related to the electronic factors of the lattice, viz., crystal field splitting energy (CFSE) of MII in [MO6]oh, formation enthalpy (ΔHf), decomposition enthalpy (ΔHd), and Madelung factor associated with the MWO4 ionic lattice. Additionally, the magnitude of the Löwdin and Bader charges on M of the M−μ2–O–W bond is directly related to the degree of ionicity or covalency in the MWO4 lattice, which indirectly influences the electronic structure and activity. The experimental results substantiated by the computational study explain the electrochemical activity of the TMTs with the help of various structural and electronic factors and bonding interactions in the lattice, which has never been realized. Therefore, the study presented here can be taken as a general guideline to correlate the reactivity to the structure of the inorganic materials.

This research offers novel ideas for development a new class of materials with enhanced OER kinetics utilizing an easy electrochemical deposition technique. Here, the Ti/CoNiyOx/FeOOH electrocatalyst was prepared in two steps. First, CoNiyOx thin film was anodically electrodeposited on an activated titanium substrate. Then iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) nanosheets were cathodically electrodeposited on the first layer. The properties of this electrocatalyst was evaluated and compared with some monolayer electrocatalysts using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Raman, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical methods. The Ti/CoNiyOx/FeOOH electrode requires an overpotential less than 330 mV at 100 mA/cm2 with Tafel constant of only 23.7 mV/dec for OER. The Ti/CoNiyOx/FeOOH electrode delivered long-term electrochemical stability in a solution containing corrosive chloride ions for more than 90 h at a constant current density of 100 mA/cm2 (with less than 9 % potential increase). Overall seawater splitting using the synthesized Ti/CoNiyOx/FeOOH electrode was performed at a current density of 100 mA/cm2 by a voltage as low as 1.58 V. The exceptional activity was ascribed to the synergistic effects of high electrochemical active sites and appropriate charge transfer ability found in CoNiyOx/FeOOH junction.

Developing nonprecious metallic electrocatalysts for water splitting is of vital importance for sustainable environment and energy technologies. As for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), FeCo‐based bimetallic catalysts have been found to act as promising candidates owing to their high intrinsic activity. Herein, a novel FeCo‐oxalate organic framework was grown on nickel foam (FeCo‐OA@NF) under mild conditions. The optimized electrocatalyst shows good OER performance with a low overpotential of 275 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline environment, comparable to that of commercial Ru‐based catalyst. Moreover, the quantification of produced oxygen by both gas chromatography and drainage method demonstrates nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. Except for the contribution of Fe and Co species for the excellent OER catalytic activity, in‐situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the positive effect of oxalate coordination also makes a difference, which can possibly reduce electron transport resistance and provide more active sites. This work provides a promising approach for the preparation of alkaline oxygen evolution electrocatalysts with low‐cost and high performance.

Aqueous Sn‐air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra‐high safety, low cost, dendrite‐free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn‐air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000 mV) of these Sn‐air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti is further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn‐air batteries. The core‐shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo‐excited electrons and holes to active oxygen‐related reaction processes. DFT and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo‐catalytic activity to promote charge kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti‐based Sn‐air batteries show ultra‐low overpotential of ~40 mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo‐assisted catalytic cathode design for new‐type metal‐air batteries.

Abstract Beyond optimizing electronic energy levels, the modulation of the electronic spin configuration is an effective strategy, often overlooked, to boost activity and selectivity in a range of catalytic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This electronic spin modulation is frequently accomplished using external magnetic fields, which makes it impractical for real applications. Herein, spin modulation is achieved by engineering Ni/MnFe 2 O 4 heterojunctions, whose surface is reconstructed into NiOOH/MnFeOOH during the OER. NiOOH/MnFeOOH shows a high spin state of Ni, which regulates the OH ‐ and O 2 adsorption energy and enables spin alignment of oxygen intermediates. As a result, NiOOH/MnFeOOH electrocatalysts provide excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 . Besides, rechargeable zinc‐air batteries based on Ni/MnFe 2 O 4 show a high open circuit potential of 1.56 V and excellent stability for more than 1000 cycles. This outstanding performance is rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which show that the optimal spin state of both Ni active sites and oxygen intermediates facilitates spin‐selected charge transport, optimizes the reaction kinetics, and decreases the energy barrier to the evolution of oxygen. This study provides valuable insight into spin polarization modulation by heterojunctions enabling the design of next‐generation OER catalysts with boosted performance.

Abstract Developing low‐cost and highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a challenging problem in electrochemical overall water splitting. Here, iron, tungsten dual‐doped nickel sulfide catalyst (Fe/W‐Ni 3 S 2 ) is synthesized on the nickel foam, and it exhibits excellent OER and HER performance. As a result, the water electrolyze based on Fe/W‐Ni 3 S 2 bifunctional catalyst illustrates 10 mA cm −2 at 1.69 V (without iR ‐compensation) and highly durable overall water splitting over 100 h tested under 500 mA cm −2 . Experimental results and DFT calculations indicate that the synergistic interaction between Fe doping and Ni vacancy induced by W leaching during the in situ oxidation process can maximize exposed OER active sites on the reconstructed NiOOH species for accelerating OER kinetics, while the Fe/W dual‐doping optimizes the electronic structure of Fe/W‐Ni 3 S 2 and the binding strength of intermediates for boosting HER. This study unlocks the different promoting mechanisms of incorporating Fe and W for boosting the OER and HER activity of Ni 3 S 2 for water splitting, which provides significant guidance for designing high‐performance bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.

Hydrogen (H2) is widely acknowledged as a promising, sustainable, and environmentally friendly energy carrier, offering numerous environmental benefits over conventional fossil fuels. However, the advancement of this technology is severely hindered by the scarcity of effective and robust catalysts for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions activity. This study marks the inaugural fabrication of a hybrid tri-metallic electrocatalyst, termed MnCoCu–P, through hydrothermal synthesis. Subsequently, the catalyst undergoes atmospheric O2 plasma surface activation, aiming to amplify the efficiency of water splitting. The novel atmospheric O2 plasma-activated MnCoCu–P electrode outperforms the reported classic metal phosphides, and it outperformed the compared commercial Pt/C and RuO2 benchmark catalysts with outstanding performances of 0.488 and 1.20 V towards HER and OER at 1000 mA/cm2, respectively. Additionally, the MnCoCu–P (5 min) catalyst Faradic efficiency was calculated under alkaline conditions in 1.0 M KOH, and both the produced gas H2 and O2 match the theoretical and experimental calculated values well, indicating a high efficiency of almost 100%. In the 2-E system, MnCoCu–P (5 min)‖MnCoCu–P (5 min) demonstrated remarkable performance by attaining a current density of 1000 mA/cm2 at low total cell voltages of 1.93 V and outperforming the benchmark Pt/C‖RuO2 electrode system. On the other hand, the MnCoCu–P electrode possesses excellent activity under industrial conditions at 6.0 M @ 60 °C exhibited 1.89 V at 1000 mA/cm2 and performs well in natural water systems. Moreover, the 5 min O2 plasma-treated MnCoCu–P‖MnCoCu–P electrodes showed improved activity in all the pH solutions which makes it one of the potential candidates for commercial application in the future.

## Oxygen-Evolution Reaction on Nickel Oxyhydroxide’s Surface: Toward a Super Catalyst for Oxygen-Evolution Reaction with Ultralow Overpotentials

This study challenges the conventional understanding of nickel (hydr)oxides as inefficient catalysts for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. It is demonstrated that nickel oxyhydroxide, characterized by several methods, forms on Ni foam's surface and exhibits OER activity at extremely low potentials. This activity becomes particularly notable at the peak of Ni(II) oxidation to Ni(III), which follows charge accumulation. Remarkably, this mesoporous, super hydrophilic, and high-surface-area catalyst requires a minimal overpotential, as low as 130 mV, with a current density of 200 μA/cm2, and displays a Tafel slope of 77.9 mV/decade in alkaline media (0.10 M KOH). Considering the amount of oxygen produced and the concentration of redox-active Ni ions in the redox peak region, the turnover frequency was calculated to be 1.1 × 10–3 s–1 at a potential of 1.36 V. Achieving these parameters at such a remarkably low overpotential holds significant promise. This study also proposes a mechanism for OER at this low overpotential, based on in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis of the Ni(II) to Ni(III) oxidation peak and the OER region. The observed low overpotential for OER can be attributed to the complex interplay between the OER process and the phenomenon of charge accumulation. All these factors result in an exceptionally low overpotential for OER. Our findings hold profound implications for the development of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for OER, particularly in water-splitting applications. This research not only expands our understanding of nickel oxyhydroxide as a potential OER catalyst but also opens avenues for future exploration in electrocatalysis.

Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the directly formation of oxygen−oxygen bond. High‐valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre‐catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn−Teller (J−T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high‐spin Mn3+ (t2g3eg1) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in‐situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH‐dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and on‐line electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O‐labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J−T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of catalyst’s electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.

Clean and renewable energy is generally localized and intermittent. Thus, energy conversion and storage technologies are necessary to compensate for these shortcomings. Electrolytic water splitting presents a reliable and promising energy technology for producing high purity hydrogen (H2). Among the platinum metals, ruthenium (Ru) has gained significant attentions as it generally outperforms commercial catalysts in terms of activity at a more affordable price. Although great progress has been made in improving the catalytic activity of Ru-based catalysts, stability remains a major challenge hindering their practical applications. To this end, this review introduces the fundamentals of the stability over Ru-based catalysts for water splitting, including the reaction mechanisms of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), measurement methods and evaluation criteria, as well as deactivation mechanisms. Moreover, the up-to-date advances of representative strategies for improving HER and OER stability of Ru-based catalysts are further discussed with respect to specific design principles and underlying mechanisms. Ultimately, insights into the challenges and opportunities for Ru-based electrocatalysts are provided to promote the development of next-generation Ru-based catalysts with exceptional stability. This review aims at guiding the design and synthesis of superior catalysts, generating increased interest among researchers, and stimulating further advanced research.

The in-situ generated oxyanions at electrochemically reconstructed catalysts from metal-based non-oxide compounds have been proven to significantly accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. However, it remains a challenge to retain these self-released oxyanions at reconstructed catalysts, hindering its utilization as a tool to develop efficient OER catalysts. Here, we demonstrate a versatile self-transformed carbonate regulation strategy to efficiently retain the self-released chalcogenate at Co oxyhydroxides reconstructed from carbon-incorporated Co selenides under OER conditions. These self-transformed CO32− can induce electron accumulation and narrow d bond at Co sites to facilitate the Co 3d–O 2p orbital hybridization between Co sites and SeOx2− for enhanced SeOx2− retention, which can accelerate the rate-limiting step for *OOH formation during OER. Relative to CoOOH-SeOx2− with limited SeOx2− residues, CoOOH-CO32−/SeOx2− with elevated SeOx2− retention by CO32− regulation exhibited a 5.6-fold increase in current density and a remarkable lower Tafel slope towards OER. This strategy paves a rational avenue to design efficient catalysts for electrooxidation reactions through finely regulating self-released oxyanions at reconstructed structures.

Hydrogen gas generated through water electrolysis can replace fossil fuels. Thus, developing cost-effective and efficient water-splitting electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is highly important. Herein, biomass-porous-carbon-supported sulphur-doped flower-like NiFe-based alloy composites are prepared using an in situ impregnation–heat treatment technology.

In this work, we examine carbonization of natural product derived thermoset polymer by CO2 laser-assisted direct-write transient pyrolysis process without and with the addition of nickel salt for possible catalytic intervention. We find that nickel indeed plays an interesting and crucial role in significantly enhancing the graphene content in the laser processed sample (Ni-LIG) retaining its few monolayer character. The unique and significant advantages of laser induced transient pyrolysis process are: a) it is a direct write process enabling in-process functionality patterning, if needed, b) it is highly energy economic because energy is localized and directed to the desired process zone, c) being a transient process it can be implemented under ambient conditions, and d) it creates distinctly different microstructure as compared to furnace annealing. It was further observed that upon incorporation of the Ni-(CH3COO)2.4H2O salt in the polymer the LIG process reduces it to Ni (111), which in turn catalyses the nucleation process and lowers the activation barrier for graphene formation by annealing the defects. Moreover, due to the very low lattice mismatch between Ni (111) and graphene facilitates its high growth quality. The concurrent decoration of Ni/NiO on graphene is also shown to promote water dissociation as well as adsorption of water oxidation intermediates. This leads to an impressive value of the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA/cm2 of only 290 mV in 1M KOH. Additionally, the catalytic capacity and structure remain stable after 30 h of continuous work in 1M KOH.

The rational design and advancement of highly efficient and readily available bifunctional electrocatalysts are crucial in pursuing renewable-energy-driven electrocatalytic water splitting as a potential strategy for clean hydrogen generation. Researchers have increasingly focused on transition-metal carbides (MXenes) in the past decade due to their distinctive properties, particularly their potential as cocatalysts in electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we have presented a method for surface modification of V2CTx MXene to create an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for water-splitting applications. The desired results are achieved through the intercalation of rare earth element Sm (samarium) with V2CTx MXene by the sonochemical method. The anchoring of samarium on the surface of two-dimensional MXene served as a conductive medium, and their extensive interfacial effects enabled the fast transportation of ions by creating short and conductive channels at the electrode–electrolyte interface by exposing more active sites. The OER and HER electrocatalytic activity of the electrode material was investigated by using a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The results showed that the Sm@V2CTx nanocomposite (referred to as V1) exhibited exceptional performance for the OER with an overpotential of 350 mV (vs RHE) delivered at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 100 mV/dec. For HER, the system is capable of delivering an overpotential of 236 mV (vs RHE) and fast kinetics, having a Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability for over 14 h. This research showcases the capability of earth-abundant MXene materials and the modification of their electrocatalytic activity to act as a foundation for creating a broad range of high-performance, environmentally sustainable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts.

Abstract Lattice oxygen loss from transition metal oxide cathodes in Li-ion batteries (LiBs) is a key factor responsible in their gradual capacity decline over time. Understanding and mitigating this phenomenon is crucial for the development of next-generation LiBs. The effect of various parameters on lattice oxygen loss, such as cathode chemical composition, has been studied extensively. However, there is a lack of experimental investigation into the lattice oxygen stability across different crystallographic facets within the same cathode composition. Here, we employed in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to investigate oxygen evolution from preferentially faceted, electrodeposited LiCoO2 cathodes. Samples predominantly exposing the (003) basal planes and the (101), (102), (110) fast Li-ion diffusing facets exhibited oxygen evolution at potentials exceeding 3.5 V vs Li+/Li. Finite element simulations helped quantify the flux of oxygen evolution on the first charge cycle to 33±5 pmol/cm2s for the basal plane and 37±9 pmol/cm2s for the faceted samples at potentials above 4 V based on single spot measurements. However, spatially resolved measurements showed that faceted samples exhibited significant heterogeneity in their oxygen evolution, reaching twofold values compared to the basal plane samples at potentials beyond 4.5 V.

The effect of different valence states Vo on the photo(electro)catalytic performance of the 2D TiO2:N system was investigated using the GGA+U method with first principles. In the poor oxygen conditions, the Ef values of 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0/Vo1+/Vo2+) systems are all less than zero, and all of them are exothermic. Photocatalytic investigations revealed that among the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo1+), 2D Ti24O46N (Vo2+), and 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) systems, the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system has the best carrier activity, the longest electron–hole lifetime, prominent visible light, infrared light redshift, and outstanding oxidation ability. The photocatalytic decomposition of water and oxygen evolution is highly advantageous. Electrocatalytic studies showed that compared with the free energy of 2D Ti24O46N (Vo1+) and 2D Ti24O46N (Vo2+) systems the free energy ΔGH* of the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system is −0.156 eV and the smallest, which is conducive to hydrogen evolution. The overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction is 0.360 V, which is close to zero, and the four reaction processes are all downward, indicating that the OER reaction can be driven independently by the photogenerated holes, which is conducive to the electrocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the ability of decomposing water is relatively good. The 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system is a candidate nanomaterial and can be applied as a novel photoelectric catalyst.

Hydrogen obtained from electrochemical water splitting is the most promising clean energy carrier, which is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, the development of an efficient OER electrocatalyst using nonprecious 3d transition elements is desirable. Multielement synergistic effect and lattice oxygen oxidation are two well-known mechanisms to enhance the OER activity of catalysts. The latter is generally related to the high valence state of 3d transition elements leading to structural destabilization under the OER condition. We have found that Al doping in nanosheet Ni-Fe hydroxide exhibits 2-fold advantage: (1) a strong enhanced OER activity from 277 mV to 238 mV at 10 mA cm

Highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts are of critical significance in the domain of water electrolysis. In this study, a Ni3N-CeO2/NF heterostructure is synthesized through a facile hydrothermal technique followed by a subsequent nitridation process. This catalyst is endowed with an abundance of oxygen vacancies, thereby conferring a richer array of active sites. Therefore, the catalyst demonstrates a markedly low overpotential of 350 mV for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) at 50 mA cm−2 and a low overpotential of 42 mV for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm−2. Serving as a dual-function electrode, this electrocatalyst is employed in overall water splitting in alkaline environments, demonstrating impressive efficiency at a cell voltage of 1.52 V of 10 mA cm−2. The in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis demonstrates that cerium dioxide (CeO2) facilitates the rapid reconfiguration of oxygen vacancy-enriched nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), thereby enhancing the OER performance. This investigation elucidates the catalytic role of CeO2 in augmenting the OER efficiency of nickel nitride (Ni3N) for water electrolysis, offering valuable insights for the design of high-performance bifunctional catalysts tailored for water splitting applications.

Barium–cobaltate-based perovskite (BaCoO3−δ) and barium–cobaltate-based nanocomposites have been intensively studied in energy storage and conversion devices mainly due to flexible oxygen stoichiometry and tunable nonprecious transition metal oxidation states. Although a rich and complex family of structural polymorphs has already been reported for these perovskites in the literature, the potential structural evolution that may occur during the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction has not been investigated so far. In this study, we synthesized and characterized the lowest Co-oxidation state possible in the compound, BaCoO2, which exhibits a quartz-derived, trigonal structure with a helicoidally corner-sharing, CoO4-tetrahedral-framework as already proposed by Spitsbergen et al. Oxygen can reversibly be inserted in such a crystal structure to form BaCoO3−δ, i.e., with 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1, based on the results of an in situ coupled thermogravimetric - neutron diffraction study and which presents therefore giant oxygen capacity storage due to the extreme tunability of the electronic configuration of the cobalt cations which defines the fundamental origins of the materials performance. The reversible conversion of BaCoO2 to BaCoO3−δ associated with a similar electronic conductivity above 900 K permits to clarify the high potential of BaCoO3−δ-based energy storage and conversion devices.

Abstract Electrocatalysis, which involves oxidation and reduction reactions with direct electron transfer, is essential for a variety of clean energy conversion devices. Currently, the vast majority of studies regarding electrocatalysis reactions focus on strong acidic or alkaline media because of the higher catalytic activity. Nevertheless, some inherent drawbacks, including the corrosive environment, expensive proton exchange membranes, and side effects, are still hard to break through. A sustainably promising way to overcome these shortcomings is to deploy neutral/near‐neutral electrolytes for electrocatalysis reactions. Unfortunately, insufficient research in this area due to the lack of attention to related issues has slowed down the development process. In this review, we systematically review the catalytic reaction mechanisms, neutral electrolytes, electrocatalysts, and modification strategies carried out in neutral media on the three most common electrocatalytic reactions, that is, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the advanced characterization tools for guiding catalyst synthesis and mechanistic studies are also summarized. Eventually, we propose some challenges and perspectives on electrocatalysis reactions in neutral media and hope it will attract more research interest and provide guidance in neutral electrocatalysis.

Using nickel foam as a substrate for electrocatalyst to report overpotential in a manuscript is a popular method in electrochemical testing or water-splitting i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, use of coated Nickel foam as substrate methodology is, in essence, not reasonable for studying the intrinsic chemistry difference of electrocatalysts. To assess water-splitting devices, Ni-foam is a valid substrate if nanoparticles are grown uniformly; however, when drop-casted ink methodology is used or there is inhomogeneous growth of nanoparticles, it becomes difficult to determine whether a particular electrocatalyst is intrinsically active or not. In order to gain a rational understanding of the electrochemical activity and overpotential findings of a specific catalyst, it is essential to recognize the limitations of Ni-foam on reflecting its intrinsic role in electrocatalytic activity. Ni-foam is therefore should not be preferred as a conductive substrate during electrochemical testing (ET). On the contrary, use of other neutral substrates like carbon fiber paper (CFP) and glassy carbon electrode (GCE) should be employed.

Abstract This work focuses on predicting and characterizing the electronic conductivity of spinel oxides, which are promising materials for energy storage devices and for the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions due to their attractive properties and abundance of transition metals that can act as active sites for catalysis. To this end, a new database was developed from first principles, including band structure and conductivity properties of spinel oxides, and machine learning algorithms were trained on this database to predict electronic conductivity and band gaps based solely on the compositions. The models developed in this study are scaled from the quantum level up to a continuum conductivity model. The relatively small database used in this study allowed for accurate predictions of band gap and conductivity. By altering the composition of spinel oxides, the model was able to predict high conductivity for spinels with high nickel content and to match experimental trends for manganese cobalt spinels. The ability to predict material properties is especially important in energy conversion devices such as batteries and supercapacitors where redox reactions take place.

Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production. The design and development of efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts are the key to realizing hydrogen production from water splitting. Herein, we successfully synthesized bifunctional MoOx/CoMo grown on copper nanowires (Cu NWs) through an electrodeposition approach, showing excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances. The MoOx/CoMo/Cu NWs catalyst exhibited overpotentials as low as 56 mV and 211 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 for HER and OER in alkaline media, respectively. Moreover, the MoOx/CoMo/Cu NWs as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting achieved a low voltage of 1.45 and 1.62 V at 10 and 50 mA cm‐2, respectively, with a stability of 10 h at 50 mA cm‐2. This work provides a promising strategy for designing highly active catalysts that replace precious‐metal‐based catalysts on energy conversion.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting is a promising technique for the production of high‐purity hydrogen. Substituting the slow anodic oxygen evolution reaction with an oxidation reaction that is thermodynamically more favorable enables the energy‐efficient production of hydrogen. Moreover, this approach facilitates the degradation of environmental pollutants and synthesis of value‐added chemicals through the rational selection of small molecules as substrates. Strategies for small‐molecule selection and electrocatalyst design are critical to electrocatalytic performance, with a focus on achieving a high current density, selectivity, Faradaic efficiency, and operational durability. This perspective discusses the key factors required for further advancement, including technoeconomic analysis, new reactor system design, meeting the requirements of industrial applications, bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical applications, and product detection and separation. This perspective aims to advance the development of hybrid water electrolysis applications.

Developing bifunctional non‐precious metal electrocatalysts of superior reactivity and durability is essential. Herein, we report a class of phthalocyanine‐based covalent organic frameworks as self‐sacrificial precursors derived Co‐based hybrid electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated Co‐COFs/CNT‐700 catalysts displayed highly efficient ORR properties with a half‐potential of 0.83 V, while its half‐wave potential in alkaline solution at a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 is 1.70 V in the OER test, reflecting exceptional OER activity. Moreover, zinc‐air batteries assembled with Co‐COFs/CNT‐700 catalysts exhibit a marginally higher power density (114 mW cm2) than traditional Pt/C‐IrO2 batteries in an air atmosphere, along with an enhanced cycling stability (5.1% potential loss after 65 h). This work may pave a facile and efficient approach for fabricating electrocatalytic materials with controllably introduced metals and heteroatoms.

Abstract Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R‐PCECs) offer the potential for high‐efficiency power generation and green hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures. However, the commercial viability of R‐PCECs is hampered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within conventional air electrodes operating at reduced temperatures. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on the simultaneous optimization of bulk‐phase metal‐oxygen bonds and in‐situ formation of a metal oxide nano‐catalyst surface modification. This strategy is designed to expedite the ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity of air electrodes exhibiting triple (O 2− , H + , e − ) conductivity. Specifically, our engineered air electrode nanocomposite‐Ba(Co 0.4 Fe 0.4 Zr 0.1 Y 0.1 ) 0.95 Ni 0.05 F 0.1 O 2.9‐δ demonstrates remarkable ORR/OER catalytic activity and exceptional durability in R‐PCECs. This is evidenced by significantly improved peak power density from 626 mW cm −2 to 996 mW cm −2 and highly stable reversibility over a 100‐hour cycling period. This research offers a rational design strategy to achieve high‐performance R‐PCEC air electrodes with superior operational activity and stability for efficient and sustainable energy conversion and storage.

Electric-driven water dissociation is considered to be a sustainable approach for the generation of H2. Ni nanoparticles show poor freshwater/seawater electrolysis activity owing to the severe aggregation of Ni, which blocks the active sites to catalyze water splitting. Here, we present Ni nanoparticles/N-doped carbon sheets by the thermal treatment of Ni-based triazole-benzoic acid complexes. The electronic state and coordination environment of Ni are modulated by the formation of the confined space with the N-doped carbon layer. Ni/N-doped carbon sheets promote acidic/alkaline hydrogen evolution activity with 143/81 mV@10 mA/cm2. Upon being used as the catalysts for water oxidation reaction, it expedited alkaline oxygen evolution 218/312 mV@10/50 mA/cm2 for Ni/N-doped carbon, which is even superior to commercial RuO2 with 309/364 mV. Tests for alkaline freshwater/seawater splitting find that Ni/N-doped carbon sheets possess remarkable activity with 1.56/1.62 V@10 mA/cm2 as well as outstanding stability. Our work offers an efficient strategy to rationally regulate the coordination structure of metal nanoparticles for promoting water electrolysis activity.

Abstract As promising energy-storage devices, zinc–air batteries (ZABs) exhibit slow reaction kinetics for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at their electrodes. High-performance bifunctional catalysts must thus be synthesized to accelerate the reversible conversion of oxygen and improve the rate and overall performance of ZABs. Herein, we reported the promising prospects of self-supported composite electrodes composed of wood-derived carbon (WDC) and bimetallic cobalt-iron alloys/oxides (CoFe-CoFe 2 O 4 @WDC) as efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline ORR/OER. WDC provided a favorable three-phase interface for heterogeneous reactions owing to its layered porous structure and genetic stability, thereby enabling mass diffusion and improving reaction kinetics. The CoFe 2 O 4 spinel surface was reduced to bimetallic CoFe alloy to form abundant heterostructure interfaces that promote electron transfer. Under alkaline conditions, the optimized composite electrode exhibited a remarkable high half-wave potential of 0.85 V and an exceptionally low overpotential of 1.49 V. It also exhibited stable performance over an impressive 2340 cycles in a ZAB. Theoretical calculations also confirmed that the heterointerface addresses the issue of proton scarcity throughout the reaction and actively facilitates the creation of O–O bonds during the reversible transformation of oxygen. This study introduces a new concept for developing bifunctional and efficient electrocatalysts based on charcoal and encourages the sustainable and high-value use of forest biomass resources.

New advances in creating effective and affordable copper-based catalysts for water splitting represent a promising strategy for driving sustainable energy technologies. However, ma- terials containing copper are susceptible to corrosion and agglomeration. In this study, we describe a synthesis route to produce olamine-functionalized CuO nanoparticles using the Hot Injection method. Nanoparticles were obtained and subsequently deposited on FTO substrates, undergoing thermal treatment at 500&deg;C and 600&deg;C in atmospheres containing O2 and N2, aiming to enhance the adhesion of the active material to the substrate and modify its oxidation state. Microstructural properties were analyzed using XRD, SEM, and TEM, while electrochemical properties were studied using CV, LSV, and EIS. Electrodes treated thermally in an N2 atmosphere at 600&deg;C exhibited higher ESCA, indicating a greater area of active sites exposed to surface reactions and, therefore, superior catalytic activity in Hy- drogen Evolution Reaction (HER). These findings show an interesting strategy for avoiding rapid electron-hole recombination and, consequently, CuO corrosion. For Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), samples treated thermally in O2 atmosphere at 500&deg;C and 600&deg;C appear to be more effective.

Abstract The development of cathode materials with controllable physicochemical structures and explicit catalytic sites is important in rechargeable Zn–air batteries (ZABs). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered increasing attention owing to their facile synthesis methods, ordered pore structure, and selectivity of functional groups. However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) inhibit their practical applications in ZABs. Herein, nucleophilic substitution is adopted to synthesize pyridine bi‐triazine covalent organic framework (denoted as O‐COF), and meanwhile, ionothermal conversion synthesis is employed to load MO x (M=Fe, Co) onto carbon nanosheet (named as FeCo@NC) to modulate the electronic structure. The Fe, Co‐N codoped carbon material possesses a large portion of pyridinic N and M‐N, high graphitization, and a larger BET surface area. An outstanding bifunctional activity has been exhibited in FeCo@NC, which provides a small voltage at 10 mA cm −2 for OER (E 10 = 1.67 V) and a remarkable half‐wave voltage for ORR (E 1/2 = 0.86 V). More impressively, when assembling ZABs, it displays notable rate performance, significant specific capacity (783.9 mAh g Zn −1 ), and satisfactory long‐term endurance. This method of regulating covalent organic framework and ionothermal synthesis can be extended to design diverse catalysts.

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as an alternative to precious metals as efficient and low‐cost catalysts for water electrolysis. Elemental doping and morphology control are effective approaches to further improve the performance of TMPs. Herein, Fe‐doped CoP nanoframes (Fe‐CoP NFs) with specific open cage configuration were designed and synthesized. The unique nano‐framework structured Fe‐CoP material shows overpotentials of only 255 and 122 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, overwhelming most transition metal phosphides. For overall water splitting, the cell voltage is 1.65 V for Fe‐CoP NFs at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , much superior to what is observed for the classical nanocubic structures. Fe‐CoP NFs show no activity degradation up to 100 h which contrasts sharply with the rapidly decaying performance of noble metal catalyst reference. The superior electrocatalytic performance of Fe‐CoP NFs due to abundant accessible active sites, reduced kinetic energy barrier, and preferable *O‐containing intermediate adsorption is demonstrated through experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Our findings could provide a potential method for the preparation of multifunctional material with hollow structures and offer more hopeful prospects for obtaining efficient earth‐abundant catalysts for water splitting.

Abstract Liquid alkaline water electrolyzers (LAWEs), being the most commercially mature electrolysis technology, play a pivotal role in large-scale hydrogen production. However, LAWEs suffer from low operational efficiency, primarily due to un-optimized electrode structure and chemical compositions. Thus, we investigated how various electrode configurations could impact LAWE performance. Our results show that Ni felt electrodes outperform the conventional Ni foam thanks to improved electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and preferred electrode surface structure that minimizes the micro-gaps in between the electrode and separator. By comparing the stainless steel (SS) felt electrodes with Ni felt electrodes, SS not only shows better oxygen evolution reaction activity but also improved hydrogen evolution reaction activity, which is less studied in the literature. We also show that a bilayer structure with small pore radius facing the separator could further improve LAWE performance by further optimizing interfacial contact between electrode and separator. These findings enable LAWEs to sustain 2 A cm-2 at 2.2 V and operate steadily at 1 A cm-2 for nearly 600 h with negligible performance decay. Our studies establish criteria for selecting electrodes to achieve high-performance LAWE and, in turn, expedite the adoption of LAWEs in hydrogen production and the transition towards low-carbon economies.

To design and construct bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activity is important to the commercial development of electrochemical water splitting (EWS) technology. The carbon clothe (CC) supported on Ni(OH)2 nanosheet is used as template to tune the morphology of Ni0.85Se. To improve the activity of Ni0.85Se, amorphous Ni4Mo alloy is anchored on the Ni0.85Se to obtain the Ni0.85Se/Ni4Mo catalyst (NS/NM) by electrodeposition method. The electron state and conductivity of NS/NM are modulated compared to that of the NS sample. It is found that the electron transfers from Ni4Mo to Ni0.85Se. Benefiting from the tuned electron state of Ni0.85Se and Ni4Mo, the enhanced number of exposed active sites and lower Rct value, the NS/NM heterostructure electrode requires low overpotentials of 51 and 206 mV to obtain 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized electrode shows fast kinetics and exhibits near to 100% Faraday efficiency for HER and OER in 1 M KOH. Importantly, it is noted that the electrocatalytic activity of NS/NM catalyst for both HER and OER is enhanced obviously in comparison with NS sample. With heterostructure catalyst, the EWS only proceeds at 1.48 V to yield 10 mA cm−2, which is reduced about 110 mV compared to NS electrode. Here, a novel kind of bifunctional heterostructure electrocatalyst is constructed.

Abstract Recently, lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising photoanode materials for efficient hydrogen production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and interfacial defect‐mediated charge accumulation inevitably result in efficiency loss and degradation of perovskite photoanodes. Herein, a defect‐passivated electron transport layer‐based perovskite photoanode combined with a catalyst layer favorable is introduced for iodide oxidation reaction bearing a small thermodynamic barrier and rapid kinetics compared to OER for efficient solar fuel generation. The resulting perovskite photoanode revealed a saturated photocurrent density of 22.4 mA cm −2 at 0.3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (V RHE ) with an impressive onset potential of −0.2 V RHE as well as durability for 225 h in a neutral electrolyte. In addition, an unbiased hydrogen‐production device comprising a perovskite photoanode and Pt coil electrocatalyst is demonstrated, achieving a remarkable solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 11.45% and stable operation for 25 h. Moreover, a wireless artificial leaf‐structured device realizing solar‐driven hydrogen generation in natural sea water under outdoor sunlight is presented.

Abstract Developing highly effective transition metal‐based bifunctional electrocatalysts remains a tremendously challenging task for large‐scale overall water splitting. Herein, a multiheterostructured Mo‐doped Ni 2 P/Fe x P electrocatalyst on NiFe foam with P vacancy (denoted as Mo─Ni 2 P/Fe x P‐V/NFF) is developed to serve as an efficient dual‐pH electrocatalyst. Due to the synergistic effect of multiple strategies (heteroatom doping, heterointerface, and P vacancy), the Mo─Ni 2 P/Fe x P‐V/NFF possesses remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity in alkaline/acidic and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, along with encouraging durability. The mechanisms of improved electrocatalytic activity combining multicharacterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are elucidated. Specifically, X‐ray absorption fine structure experimental analysis confirms that the Mo doping can optimize the electronic structure of electrocatalyst. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the evolved oxyhydroxides are the real active substances for the OER. DFT calculations reveal that the conductivity of as‐prepared samples can be enhanced through multiple strategy synergy. Moreover, in the HER process, multiple strategies can not only reduce the hydrogen binding energy to near zero but also enhance the H 2 O dissociation and *OH desorption. In the OER process, DFT calculations also verify that Mo doping and interface engineering can optimize the adsorption of the rate‐determining step, achieving the lowest theoretical overpotential.

Nickel–molybdenum–boron (Ni–Mo–B)-based catalysts with biphasic interfaces are highly advantageous in bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline water-splitting. However, it remains an ongoing challenge to obtain porous Ni–Mo alloy substrates that provide stable adhesion to catalysts, ensuring the long-term performance of bifunctional self-supporting electrodes at a high current density. Herein, a porous Ni–Mo alloy substrate was effectively obtained by a cost-effective dealloying process on a commercial Ni–Mo alloy with high-energy crystal planes. Subsequently, the Mo2NiB2/Ni3B bifunctional catalyst was in situ synthesized on this substrate via boriding heat treatment, resulting in outstanding catalytic activity and stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the abundant biphasic interfaces and surface-reconstructed sites of the Mo2NiB2/Ni3B catalyst can decrease the energy barriers for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Thus, the designed self-supporting electrodes show bifunctional catalytic activity with overpotentials of 151 mV for HER and 260 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm–2. Markedly, the assembled water electrolyzer can be driven up to 10 mA cm–2 at 1.64 V and maintain catalytic activity at a high current density of 1000 mA cm–2 for 100 h. The new strategy is expected to provide a low-cost scheme for designing self-supporting bifunctional electrodes with high activity and excellent stability and contribute to the development of hydrogen energy technology.

Hydrogen has been identified as a clean, zero carbon, sustainable, and promising energy source for the future, and electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production is an emission-free, efficient energy conversion technology. A major limitation of this approach is the unavailability of efficient, abundant, inexpensive catalysts, which prompts the need for new catalytic materials. Here, we report the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of a novel transition metal-based ternary chalcogenide family, LaMS$_3$ (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Powder X-ray diffraction confirms the phase purity of these materials, while composition analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirms the presence of the stoichiometric ratio of elements in these compounds. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were used to study the chemical states on the surface and in bulk, respectively. These materials exhibit bifunctional catalytic activity towards the two half-reactions of the water-splitting process, with LaNiS$_3$ being the most active material for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The LaMS$_3$ compounds show long-term stability with negligible change in the overpotential at a constant current density of 10 mA cm$^{-2}$ over 18 hours of measurements. As compared to the corresponding ternary oxides, the LaMS$_3$ materials exhibit higher activity and significantly lower Tafel slopes. The ability to catalyze both half-reactions of water electrolysis makes these materials promising candidates for bifunctional catalysts and presents a new avenue to search for high-efficiency electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Ultrathin film of active materials having thickness <5 nm emerged as a promising candidate for miniaturized energy storage and conversion devices. However, the small lateral size restricts its real device applications. Herein, we report large area, 2D, ultrathin (thickness: 4.3±0.3 nm) Co(OH)2 nanosheets as bi-functional electrode material for supercapacitor and oxygen evolution reaction developed by Ionic layer epitaxy (ILE) method at the water-air interface. The symmetric supercapacitor device exhibited excellent volumetric capacitance of 2313 F cm-3 at 0.4 mA cm-2 current density. Additionally, it exhibited a remarkable volumetric energy density of 0.205 Wh cm-3 at a power density of 0.145 W cm-3, which is better than reported 2D electrode materials. Furthermore, the Co(OH)2 ultrathin-film electrodes showed improved OER electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential (ƞ10, 330 mV) and Tafel slope (47 mV dec-1). The structural and morphological investigations after long-term operations show substantial stability of the electrode material. The theoretical investigations of electronic structures, quantum capacitance, and free energy profiles for the OER mechanism corroborate the experimental results.

Abstract Hybrid water electrolysis offers a groundbreaking approach to energy‐saving hydrogen production by utilizing thermodynamically favorable and value‐added reactions to replace sluggish anodic oxygen evolution in overall water splitting. However, numerous anodic processes generate intermediates or products incompatible with aqueous environments, thereby degrading anodic performance to limit the efficiency and durability of hybrid water electrolysis. Herein, this difficulty is addressed by applying anodic mass transport intensification in conjunction with catalyst engineering, realizing a long‐lasting hybrid seawater electrolysis coupling sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) for efficient hydrogen production below 1.2 V at an industrial‐level current density of 500 mA cm −2 . An exceptional longevity of 2000 h is achieved for the electrolysis by eliminating anode passivation by sulfur deposition during SOR, a general concern in the sulfur‐involved industrial sector. This technology cut the electricity expense of hydrogen production to 2.80 kWh m −3 H 2 , undercutting alkaline water electrolysis by 34.9–51.1%. Simultaneously, fast upcycling of sulfion pollutants to value‐added sulfur is achieved to add additional economic and environmental profits, enabling hydrogen production at a midpoint expense ($ 0.93) of the United States Department of Energy's 2026 target ($ 2.0) for the cost per gallon of gasoline‐equivalent.

Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high-temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir-B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor-acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate-determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir-B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B-induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

Abstract In this work, we explored the recovering possibilities of nickel‐based products from the cathode materials of spent nickel‐metal hydride (NiMH) batteries collected from car repair centers in Mongolia. Specifically, nickel‐based by‐products such as metallic nickel, Ni microparticles, nickel oxide, nickel chloride, and betta‐phase ( β ) nickel hydroxide powders are successfully produced. X‐ray diffraction patterns suggested that all samples show high crystallinity and phase purity. Ni microparticles were recovered using a chemical reduction method from a leachate solution prepared by dissolving the cathode of the spent NiMH battery in hydrochloric acid. Notably, β ‐Ni(OH)₂ displayed two redox peaks in KOH electrolyte solution, suggesting that it has excellent electrochemical potential and can be reused for the fabrication of new NiMH batteries. To validate the electrochemical performances, we examined the catalytic activity of nickel microparticles as a catalyst for the degradation of Congo red (CR) dye and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reduction reaction rate of CR dye in the presence of a nickel catalyst was 2.17×10 −3 s −1 , significantly higher than the control experiment without a nickel catalyst. These results provide possible solutions for developing sustainable battery systems by recovering different nickel‐based products from spent NiMH batteries.

Transition metal oxides are widely pursued as potent electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, single-metal chromium catalysts remain underexplored due to their intrinsic activity limitations. Herein, we successfully synthesize mixed-valence, nitrogen-doped Cr2O3/CrO3/CrN@NC nanoelectrocatalysts via one-step targeted pyrolysis techniques from a binuclear Cr-based complex (Cr2(Salophen)2(CH3OH)2), which is strategically designed as a precursor. Comprehensive pyrolysis mechanisms were thoroughly delineated by using coupled thermogravimetric analysis and mass spectrometry (TG–MS) alongside X-ray diffraction. Below 800 °C, the generation of a reducing atmosphere was noted, while continuous pyrolysis at temperatures exceeding 800 °C promoted highly oxidized CrO3 species with an elevated +6 oxidation state. The optimized catalyst pyrolyzed at 1000 °C (Cr2O3/CrO3/CrN@NCs-1000) demonstrated remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential of 290 mV in 1 M KOH and excellent stability. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a much smaller reaction energy barrier of CrO3 than the low oxidation state species for OER reactivity. This work reveals fresh strategies for rationally engineering chromium-based electrocatalysts and overcoming intrinsic roadblocks to enable efficient OER catalysis through a deliberate oxidation state and compositional tuning.

The domain of energy research is vigorously exploring a wide array of materials, from advanced carbon-based substances like graphene and carbon nanotubes to emerging contenders like MXenes. Ti3C2 MXene offers exceptional performance in electrochemistry, benefiting from its remarkable electronic conductivity, considerable surface area, chemical stability, cost-effectiveness, hydrophilicity, and eco-friendliness. However, it undergoes self-accumulation, which diminishes the number of electrochemically active sites, resulting in decreased performance. In this study, MnO2 particles are intricately anchored onto the surfaces and within the layers of nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 (N–Ti3C2), resulting in the creation of innovative interface engineered N–Ti3C2/MnO2 nanosheets. Due to its distinctive heterostructure and favourable interfacial interaction, the N–Ti3C2/MnO2 electrode shows better performance in both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, exhibiting low overpotentials of 130 mV and 289 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, it requires a cell voltage of 1.7 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 during the overall water splitting process. The N–Ti3C2/MnO2 composite also maintains sustained durability for a period of 4 h. This enhanced electrochemical activity of N–Ti3C2/MnO2 can be due to the synergistic effects resulting from the intricate contact between N–Ti3C2 and MnO2. This research presents a simple methodology for designing MXenes-based multicomponent electrodes for electrochemical water splitting reactions and its potential application for electrochemical water splitting.

Exploiting the high-entropy alloy (HEA) electrocatalysts with the synergistic effect of multi-metal components is an effective approach to address the slow kinetics and undesirable stability of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Zn-air batteries (ZABs), but still faces many challenges. In this study, a multimetallic Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived HEA catalyst was successfully fabricated on carbon fiber as a flexible self-supporting electrode (denoted as CC@FeCoNiMoRu-HEA/C) for high-performance liquid/flexible ZABs using a facile and cost-effective strategy. The three-dimensional (3D) highly open network framework and hierarchical porous structure accelerate the mass transport of OH−/O2 and charge transfer. The electronic structure adjustment, lattice defects and high entropy effects enable the CC@FeCoNiMoRu-HEA/C catalysts to perform high OER catalytic activity and strong durability while reducing the Ru content and lowering the economic cost. In situ Raman spectra and XPS results reveal the generation of metal-OOH intermediates on the HEA surface during the OER process. In a practical demonstration, the liquid ZAB assembled with CC@FeCoNiMoRu-HEA/C + Pt/C as the air electrode offers stable open-circuit voltage, large power density, excellent specific capacity and satisfactory cycle life, outperforming the commercial RuO2 + Pt/C-based reference ZAB. More attractively, the flexible solid-state ZAB also achieves fast dynamic response, high peak power density, robust cycling stability as well as favorable mechanical flexibility, indicating a promising application prospect in future flexible electronics and wearable devices. This work provides a viable pathway to develop low precious metal-loaded HEAs as advanced OER self-supporting electrocatalysts and realize high-performance flexible energy storage devices.

Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exfoliated from bulk layered materials possess interesting properties. Most transition metal oxides (TMOs) are not layered and therefore cannot be exfoliated. Here we report the synthesis of a new family of ultrathin materials – transition metal oxychalcogenides (TMOCs) and demonstrate their unique properties. Specifically, 2D TMOCs such as HfSxOy, ZrSxOy, TiSxOy, TaSxOy, NbSxOy, VSexOy, HfSexOy, ZrSexOy, TaTexOy (x, y ~ 0–2) from bulk TMDs (HfS2, ZrS2, TiS2, TaS2, NbS2, VSe2, HfSe2, ZrSe2, TaTe2) have been fabricated using tetrabutylammonium intercalation. The stoichiometry of TMOCs can be adjusted, which enables control of their optical band gaps and tunability of electrical conductivity by more than 8 orders of magnitude. Our results show that by tuning the chalcogen to oxygen ratio along with local atomic structure in TMOCs, it is possible to impart unexpected properties. For example, in contrast to conventional TMDs, the hybrid structure renders TMOCs surprisingly stable and electrochemically active in strong acids, which allows them to be used as proof-of-concept catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at pH ≈ 0. The HfS0.52O1.09 catalysts show high mass activity (10,3000 A g–1 at an overpotential of 0.5 V) and exhibit durability in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysers.

The microbiological safety of irrigation water is critical to the prevention of fresh produce contamination with human pathogens. This work reports on the electrochemical disinfection of natural irrigation water using an undivided batch cell assembled with titanium (Ti) electrodes as both anode and cathode. Although Ti is considered an inactive electrode material for most applications due to the presence of an oxide film on the surface, we show here that it can efficiently catalyze the electrochemical oxidation of a few ppm of chloride ions in natural irrigation water to free chlorine species, which in turn enable fast disinfection. Disinfection experiments were performed by applying a polarity-reversing direct current between the two Ti electrodes. Compared to applying a polarity-constant direct current, the polarity-reversal technique effectively inhibited extensive oxidation of the Ti electrode surface as indicated by a lower oxide/hydroxide content on the electrode surface, thus providing excellent stability during electrolysis. The natural irrigation water was collected from the Waiahole Ditch Irrigation System in Hawaii. The naturally occurring concentration of chloride in the water was 1.84 mg/L and no other chemicals were added. E. coli K12 ER2738 was selected as a model bacterium to evaluate the electrochemical cell’s disinfection capability. The applied current density was varied between 0 mA/cm2 and 2 mA/cm2, and the half-period (T/2) of the polarity-reversing direct current was varied between 5 s and 60 s. The best disinfection performance was achieved at 2 mA/cm2 and T/2 = 10 s, requiring only 5 min of treatment for the complete disinfection of E. coli (4-log reduction). The trends in the concentration of free and total chlorine in the solution matched very well with those of the disinfection efficiency, suggesting that E. coli was inactivated by free chlorine species electrogenerated at the Ti electrodes. Hydrogen peroxide, short-lived oxidants, and direct electron transfer most likely had minor contributions to the disinfection process. The presence of a volcano-shaped dependence of the free and total chlorine concentration and disinfection efficiency on T/2 suggests that the chloride oxidation activity of the Ti electrode was closely related to the oxidation state (or the thickness of the oxide layer) of the electrode surface, i.e., there exists an optimal oxide layer thickness at which the Ti electrode shows the highest electrocatalytic activity toward chloride oxidation. During the disinfection experiment, disinfection byproducts (DBPs) of chlorate, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform were not detected in the solution. Chloroform was first seen in the solution at 10 min (2.5 μg/L), and then its concentration increased to 9.0 μg/L at 20 min. These values are significantly lower than recommendations for drinking water, and the timeframe of chloroform production suggests a 5 min disinfection treatment avoids significant DBP formation. As a comparison, Pt/Ti electrodes prepared by electrodeposition showed negligible disinfection at 2 mA/cm2, but the disinfection efficiency increased dramatically at 4 mA/cm2 and 6 mA/cm2. This phenomenon was most likely due to the Pt catalyst’s high activity, readily catalyzing side reactions such as oxygen evolution and oxidation of organic matter in the natural irrigation water. The Ti electrodes consumed less electrical energy than the Pt/Ti electrodes because they needed a lower current density to achieve similar disinfection efficiency. The current work demonstrates that the Ti electrode electrochemical cell can provide an efficient, robust, and cost-effective solution to irrigation water disinfection, and thus is well suited for agriculture sector applications.

Oxygenic photosynthesis generates the initial energy source which fuels nearly all life on earth. At the heart of the process are the photosystems, pigment binding multi-protein complexes that catalyse the first step of photochemical conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Here, we investigate the molecular evolution at single residue resolution of the plastid-encoded subunits of the photosystems across 773 angiosperm species. We show that despite an extremely high level of conservation, 7% of residues in the photosystems, spanning all photosystem subunits, exhibit hallmarks of adaptive evolution. Through in silico modelling of these adaptive substitutions we uncover the impact of these changes on the properties of the photosystems, focussing on their effects on co-factor binding and the formation of inter-subunit interfaces. We further reveal that evolution has repeatedly destabilised the interaction photosystem II and its D1 subunit, thereby reducing the energetic barrier for D1 turn-over and photosystem repair. Together, these results provide new insight into the trajectory of photosystem evolution during the radiation of the angiosperms.

Abstract. Understanding the compositions and evolution of atmospheric organic vapors is crucial for exploring their impact on air quality. However, the molecular and seasonal characteristics of organic vapors in urban areas, with complex anthropogenic emissions and high variability, remain inadequately understood. In this study, we conducted measurements in urban Beijing during 2021–2022 covering four seasons using a Vocus-PTR, an improved Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS). During the measurement period, a total of 895 peaks are observed, and 543 of them can be assigned to formulas. The contribution of CxHyOz species is most significant, which compose up to 53.7 % of the number and 76.0 % of the mass of total organics. With enhanced sensitivity and mass resolution, various sub-ppt level species and organics with multiple oxygens (≥3) were discovered. When counting the species number, 42.2 % of the organics measured are at sub-ppt level and 37.8 % of the species contain 3–8 oxygens. Organic vapors with multiple oxygens mainly consist of intermediate volatility and semi-volatile compounds, and many of them are found to be the multi-generational oxidation products of various volatile organic precursors. In summer, the fast photooxidation process generates organic vapors with multiple oxygens, and leads to an increase in both their concentration and proportion. While in other seasons, the variations of organic vapors with multiple oxygens are closely correlated with those of organic vapors with 1–2 oxygens, which could be heavily influenced by primary emissions. Organic vapors with low oxygen content (≤ 2 oxygens) are comparable to the results obtained by traditional PTR-MS measurements in both urban Beijing and neighboring regions.

Abstract Background Cancers are spatially heterogenous, thus their clonal evolution, especially following anti-cancer treatments, depends on where the mutated cells are located within the tumor tissue. For example, cells exposed to different concentrations of drugs, such as cells located near the vessels in contrast to those residing far from the vasculature, can undergo a different evolutionary path. However, classical representations of cell lineage trees do not account for this spatial component of emerging cancer clones. Here, we propose routines to trace spatial and temporal clonal evolution in computer simulations of the tumor evolution models. Results The LinG3D (Lineage Graphs in 3D) is an open-source collection of routines (in MATLAB, Python, and R) that enables spatio-temporal visualization of clonal evolution in a two-dimensional tumor slice from computer simulations of the tumor evolution models. These routines draw traces of tumor clones in both time and space, and may include a projection of a selected microenvironmental factor, such as the drug or oxygen distribution within the tumor, if such a microenvironmental factor is used in the tumor evolution model. The utility of LinG3D has been demonstrated through examples of simulated tumors with different number of clones and, additionally, in experimental colony growth assay. Conclusions This routine package extends the classical lineage trees, that show cellular clone relationships in time, by adding the space component to show the locations of cellular clones within the 2D tumor tissue patch from computer simulations of tumor evolution models.

TiZrNbVAl lightweight high-entropy alloys (LHEAs) with body-centered cubic (BCC) structure have received extensive attention due to their low density and considerable mechanical properties. And the mechanical properties of these LHEAs can be further improved by adjusting the local chemical order (LCO). Here, we report a strategy for regulating LCOs in TiZrNbVAl LHEAs by adding oxygen. The results showed that the yield strength of LHEA increased from 787.8 MPa to 1029.5 MPa after oxygen addition. Moreover, the microstructure evolution proves that LCOs is conducive to promoting the transition of dislocation from plane slip, which is easy to produce stress concentration, to multistage slip, which improves the homogenizing deformation ability, and increasing the ductility from 12.8% to 20.9%, which is an increase of ∼63%. Our work provides a paradigm for achieving outstanding strength-ductility tradeoff in BCC-LHEAs via O doping.

Exploring highly efficient ultrasound-triggered catalysts is pivotal for various areas. Herein, we presented that Ba2+ doped brookite TiO2 nanorod (TiO2: Ba) with polarization-induced charge separation is a candidate. The replacement of Ba2+ for Ti4+ not only induced significant lattice distortion to induce polarization but also created oxygen vacancy defects for facilitating the charge separation, leading to high-efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS) evolution in the piezo-catalytic processes. Furthermore, the piezocatalytic ability to degrade dye wastewater demonstrates a rate constant of 0.172 min-1 and achieves a 100 % antibacterial rate at a low dose for eliminating E. coli. This study advances that doping can induce piezoelectricity and reveals that lattice distortion-induced polarization and vacancy defects engineering can improve ROS production, which might impact applications such as water disinfection and sonodynamic therapy.

C4 photosynthesis is a repeatedly evolved adaptation to photosynthesis that functions to reduce energy loss from photorespiration. The recurrent evolution of this adaptation is achieved through changes in the expression and localisation of several enzymes and transporters that are conventionally used in non-photosynthetic metabolism. These alterations result in the establishment of a biochemical CO2 pump that increases the concentration of CO2 around rubisco in a cellular environment where rubisco is protected from oxygen thus preventing the occurrence of photorespiration. A key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is the change in subcellular localisation of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity from the mesophyll cell chloroplast to the cytosol, where it catalyzes the first biochemical step of the C4 pathway. Here, we achieve this key step in C4 evolution in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) using genome editing. We show that editing the chloroplast transit peptide of the primary CA isoform in the leaf results in relocalisation of leaf CA activity from the chloroplast to the cytosol. Through analysis of fluorescence induction kinetics in these CA relocalisation lines we uncover a role a new role for chloroplast CA in photosynthetic induction. We also reveal that relocalisation of CA activity to the cytosol causes no detectable perturbation to plant growth or leaf-level CO2 assimilation. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel role for chloroplast CA in C3 plants, and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis by genome editing.

Abstract The utilization of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) have underscored their utility in addressing the challenge of the elevated overpotential during the charging process. Nonetheless, the generation of highly electrophilic singlet oxygen (1O2) throughout the battery cycles leads to adverse reactions with RMs, thereby impeding their effectiveness. In the quest for enhanced RM durability, this study unveils a novel RM, 7,7'-bi-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (BAC), incorporating N–N interconnected aza-bicycles, and assesses its efficacy and robustness relative to those of other N–N non-bicyclic RMs. Unlike non-bicyclic RMs, which exhibit diminished O2 evolution after exposure to 1O2, BAC maintains consistent O2 profiles during charging, indicating its superior 1O2 resistance and steady redox-catalyst performance in LOBs. Theoretical analyses align with the experimental findings that the bicyclic structural design of BAC confers a superior ability to resist oxidative degradation through cleavage of the C–H bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms.

Abstract Light‐assisted Li‐O 2 batteries exhibit a high round‐trip efficiency attributable to the assistance of light‐generated electrons and holes in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Nonetheless, the excitonic effect arising from Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes impedes carrier separation, thus hindering efficient utilization of photo‐energy. Herein, porphyrinic metal‐organic frameworks with (Fe 2 Ni)O(COO) 6 clusters were used as photocathodes to accelerate exciton dissociation into charge carriers for light‐assisted Li‐O 2 batteries. The coupling of Ni 3d and Fe 3d orbitals boosts ligand‐to‐metal cluster charge transfer, and hence drives exciton dissociation and activates O 2 for superoxide ( • O 2 − ) radicals, rather than singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) under photoexcitation. These enable the light‐assisted Li‐O 2 batteries with a low total overvoltage of 0.28 V and round‐trip efficiency of 92% under light irradiation of 100 mW cm −2 . This work highlights the excitonic effect in photoelectrochemical processes and provides insights into photocathode design for light‐assisted Li‐O 2 batteries. This article is protected by copyright.

This work examines the oxygenation process of polycrystalline powder of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ superconductor material through constant temperature thermogravimetric analysis. Starting from completely deoxygenated samples ($\delta$ = 0), both the mass evolution in an oxygen atmosphere and a differential temperature value referenced to an inert sample (alumina powder) subjected to the same experimental conditions are recorded. The oxygenation process itself is identified as an exothermic process accompanied by a second also exothermic associated process. This second process is identified as the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition present in the material. Based on the obtained results, the structural phase diagram of the material is reconstructed. Issues of metastability of the structural phases, as well as the potential of the equipment used to obtain these results comparable to those obtained in large facilities, are discussed. Reinterpretations of previously discussed works in the literature are inferred.

Abstract. A three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model with multiple nutrient and plankton functional groups was developed and adapted to the Gulf of Mexico to investigate the role of nutrients and the complexity of plankton community in dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics. A 15-year hindcast was achieved covering the period of 2006–2020. Extensive model validation against in situ data demonstrates that the model was capable of reproducing vertical distributions of DO and spatial distributions of bottom DO concentration, as well as their interannual variations. The study demonstrates that bottom DO dynamics and hypoxia evolution are significantly influenced by both physical processes and local biochemistry, with sedimentary oxygen consumption and vertical diffusion identified as key contributors. Summer hydrodynamics play a critical role in nutrient distribution and limitation: a notable expansion of Si limitation was simulated when coastal currents shifted eastward or northward. This effect, especially pronounced on the western part of the Louisiana–Texas shelf, underscores the importance of nutrient limitation in shaping DO dynamics. The model identifies a bi-peak primary production pattern in spring and early summer, aligned with satellite chlorophyll a variations, attributed to the complexity of the plankton community and interactions among different plankton groups. Our findings emphasize the necessity of integrating sophisticated plankton community dynamics into biogeochemical models to understand primary production variability and its impact on bottom hypoxia.

Gold (Au) is a precious metal that has played an important role in the development of the global economy. It is therefore important to better define the genesis of Au mineralisation as an aid to focus exploration as the consumption of Au increases. The Dashui goldfield contains a super large Au resource of over 120 t (tonnes) in the West Qinling Orogen, central China. Despite several studies have focused on the genesis of the Dashui goldfield, the original physico–chemical natures of the magmatic and hydrothermal evolution remain unclear. Biotite and apatite in the mineralised diorite porphyry in the goldfield are sensitive to the changes in the physico–chemical conditions and the evolution of magmatic and hydrothermal fluids, and thus provide important keys to address these issues. Hence, we conducted detailed in–situ major and trace element studies of biotite and apatite from the ore–bearing diorite porphyry in the Dashui goldfield. Our aim is to elucidate the physico–chemical conditions, magma source, and the magmatic and hydrothermal evolution processes during the deposition of the gold, and to enhance the understanding of the Au genesis in the West Qinling Au province. Using the geochemistry of magmatic apatite, and magmatic and hydrothermal biotite, we have found that the crystallisation temperature and pressure along with emplacement depth of diorite porphyry were constrained at ∼ 737–791 °C, 1.08–1.73 kbar, and 3.94–6.30 km. The diorite porphyry has the geochemical affinities with calcium alkaline orogenic suites derived from a mixed crustal and mantle source. During the early emplacement of the diorite porphyry, the melt had a high oxygen fugacity and was highly enriched in Au. During the late magma crystallisation of the diorite porphyry, the magma was enriched continuously in most elements with the Ba/Rb ratios in the biotite varying from 10 to 5, and most of the Au was hosted by pyrite. Additionally, elements were continuously dissolved into fluids generating Cl–rich hydrothermal fluids during the evolution of the magma. During hydrothermal evolution, Au is migrated with As and Sb in the vapour phases of fluids, whereas Au migrated with Cl in the liquid phase. When temperatures dropped to ∼ 200–400 °C, Au started to combine with S and Si in the liquid phase of fluids. Subsequently, hydrothermal fluids interacted with host carbonate to form the Dashui goldfield, the Au during this stage was also transported and hosted in magnetite, hematite, and quartz within the carbonate rocks.

Abstract The interturn paper insulation of oil‐immersed power transformer windings, under the combined influence of electric fields, moisture, and conductor heating, will produce bubbles, which pose a significant threat to the insulation system. However, there is limited research on the characteristics of bubble evolution in oil–paper insulation under the influence of electric fields and the subsequent dissolution process. Based on the continuous observation of bubble size using electron microscopes, experimental and theoretical investigations into the formation and dissolution of bubbles under electric field conditions are presented. The effects of different field strengths on bubble evolution and dissolution characteristics were studied. The results showed that the electric field promoted both the generation and dissolution of bubbles, with a more pronounced effect observed at higher field strengths (below partial discharge (PD) inception electric field, hereafter referred to as PDIE). However, when the field strength exceeded PDIE, the bubbles tended to shrink and gradually increase in size. The changes in bubble volume were related to not only gas diffusion but also oxygen consumption and fault gases generation due to PD. A better understanding of the formation and dissolution characteristics of bubbles under varying field strengths is achieved. Furthermore, it also provides a reference for assessing the risk of bubble generation and conducting bubble‐related fault diagnosis during the overload operation of oil‐immersed power equipment.

Numerical simulations are carried out to understand the heat energy transport characteristics of an autothermal reactor by steam-methanol reforming on copper-based catalysts. Mathematical expressions are derived for the reactor system based upon the principles of chemical kinetics and fluid mechanics. Enthalpy analysis is performed and the evolution of energy in the reforming and oxidation processes is discussed in terms of reaction heat flux. The effects of different factors on the thermal behavior of the autothermal reactor is evaluated in order to fully describe the thermal energy change in the reactor. The objective of the present study is to understand the heat energy transport characteristics of microchannel reactors for hydrogen production by steam-methanol reforming on copper-based catalysts. Emphasis is placed on the effects of different factors on the thermal behavior of autothermal reactors. The results indicate that the heat required for the endothermic reforming reaction must pass through the wall of the tube. Minimal oxygen requirements serve to inhibit carbon formation in the catalyst bed. Small size and weight allow for rapid catalyst bed heat-up to operating temperatures which is a critical requirement for quick start capability necessary in most vehicle applications. The temperature within the hot spot can be increased or decreased respectively by increasing or decreasing respectively the amount of oxygen supplied to the mixture. Direct heating is of considerable advantage as it largely overcomes the problems encountered with reaction rates being limited by the rate of heat transfer through the tube wall. The intervening walls may be flat plates or cylindrical walls with heat transfer capabilities. The separation is often affected by an adsorption process after condensing out the steam from the shifted gas. Silicon is considered a good material for fabrication of microreactors due to the high strength of the silicon-silicon bonds which results in the chemical inertness and thermal stability of silicon.

Aqueous Sn‐air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra‐high safety, low cost, dendrite‐free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn‐air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000 mV) of these Sn‐air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti is further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn‐air batteries. The core‐shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo‐excited electrons and holes to active oxygen‐related reaction processes. DFT and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo‐catalytic activity to promote charge kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti‐based Sn‐air batteries show ultra‐low overpotential of ~40 mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo‐assisted catalytic cathode design for new‐type metal‐air batteries.

Sulfur (S) is a central element in global biogeochemical cycling and Earth's redox evolution. Minerals that contain S are an important record of local environmental conditions at the time of their formation based on chemical speciation and redox. However, the oxidation state of S for hundreds of different S-containing minerals and thousands of S-containing mineral localities is unknown, largely sulfides and sulfosalts, and the redox state alone does not fully capture mineral chemistry diversity, thus limiting understanding of S redox evolution. Here, we use mineral chemistry network analysis and the weighted Mineral Element Electronegativity Coefficient of Variation (wMEECV) metric to investigate the element interactions and localities of S-containing minerals from the Mineral Evolution Database (MED) to infer the redox state of S in minerals where the redox state is unknown (SU). Louvain community detection of the S mineral chemistry redox network reveals that there are three main network communities that are separated by redox state. The S6+ community includes minerals that contain the S6+ redox state and a small number of S4+ and S2+ minerals, the S2− community includes S2−-containing minerals, and the SU community includes minerals in which the redox state of S is unknown. The wMEECV values of the SU community closely overlap with the wMEECV values of the S2− community, and do not overlap with the wMEECV values of the S6+ community, indicating the SU community minerals contain predominately reduced S. Assuming that SU community minerals contain reduced S, as supported by their network chemical associations and wMEECV values, then reduced S-containing minerals make up approximately 81 % of S-containing mineral localities in the S mineral chemistry network, even though the majority of all mineral localities (S-containing and non-S-containing) are oxygen (O)-containing minerals. Additionally, reduced S-containing minerals make up the majority (∼75 %) of all non-O containing mineral localities in the MED, representing the importance of reduced S as an electron source and substrate in the evolution of microbial metabolic networks. The range wMEECV values of S6+ community minerals expands through time due primarily to formation of chemically diverse sulfate minerals, coinciding with crustal oxidation from the late Proterozoic to Phanerozoic and the expansion of the marine sulfate reservoir. The intersection of shared constituent elements among reduced and oxidized S in the mineral chemistry network represents redox convergence of weathered S in the geosphere that was crucial in the formation of natural resource deposits and the evolution of biogeochemical cycles.

Abstract This study presents an overview of the Late Cenozoic evolution of the West African Monsoon (WAM), and the associated changes in atmospheric dynamics and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation (δ 18 O p ). This evolution is established by using the high‐resolution isotope‐enabled GCM ECHAM5‐wiso to simulate the climatic responses to paleoenvironmental changes during the Mid‐Holocene (MH), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and Mid‐Pliocene (MP). The simulated responses are compared to a set of GCM outputs from Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 4 (PMIP4) to assess the added value of a high resolution and model consistency across different time periods. Results show WAM magnitudes and pattern changes that are consistent with PMIP4 models and proxy reconstructions. ECHAM5‐wiso estimates the highest WAM intensification in the MH, with a precipitation increase of up to 150 mm/month reaching 25°N during the monsoon season. The WAM intensification in the MP estimated by ECHAM5‐wiso (up to 80 mm/month) aligns with the mid‐range of the PMIP4 estimates, while the LGM dryness magnitude matches most of the models. Despite an enhanced hydrological cycle in MP, MH simulations indicate a ∼50% precipitation increase and a greater northward extent of WAM than the MP simulations. Strengthened conditions of the WAM in the MH and MP result from a pronounced meridional temperature gradient driving low‐level westerly, Sahel‐Sahara vegetation expansion, and a northward shift of the Africa Easterly Jet. The simulated δ 18 O p values patterns and their relationship with temperature and precipitation are non‐stationarity over time, emphasizing the implications of assuming stationarity in proxy reconstruction transfer functions.

Extreme pinniped divers are extraordinary models to study adaptations to hypoxia/reoxygenation events derived from extreme fluctuations in oxygen levels during deep diving. We analyzed the evolutionary adaptations of the Weddell seal ( Leptonychotes weddellii) and the Northern and Southern elephant seals ( Mirounga angustirostris and M. leonina), which have exceptional diving abilities, reaching depths of over 1000 meters for extended periods up to 90 minutes. To understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning these remarkable adaptations, we conducted a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of thirteen pinniped species. Our gene family evolution analyses revealed a significant loss of function in genes involved in the enzymatic degradation of glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant that our functional analysis have previously shown to increase rapidly in response to hypoxia exposure in primary cells derived from extreme divers, likely to protect cells against oxidative damage. We also detected adaptive signatures in pathways involved in the optimization of mitochondrial respiration, energy metabolism, DNA repair and cardiovascular regulation in these extreme divers. Notably the Weddell seal exhibited more genes under positive selection compared to the Elephant seals, possibly reflecting adaptations to extreme environmental pressures. Pathways enriched in Weddell seals include those related to fat metabolism, oxidative damage against hydrogen peroxide and membrane lipid remodeling. Our analysis sheds light on the remarkable genomic adaptations that enable extreme pinniped divers to tolerate oxygen fluctuations associated with deep diving while offering valuable insights into their unique physiological and biochemical strategies for overcoming the challenges posed by hypoxia and reperfusion damage.

We derive the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in the Narrow Line Regions (NLRs) of a sample of 38 local ($z \: < \: 0.4$) Seyfert~2 nuclei. For that, we consider narrow optical emission line intensities and direct estimates of the electron temperatures ($T_{\rm e}$-method). We find nitrogen abundances in the range $7.6 \: < \: \rm 12+log(N/H) \: < \: 8.6$ (mean value $8.06\pm0.22$) or $\rm 0.4 \: < \: (N/N_{\odot}) \: < 4.7$, in the metallicity regime $8.3 \: < \: \rm 12+log(O/H) \: < \: 9.0$. Our results indicate that the dispersion in N/H abundance for a fixed O/H value in AGNs is in agreement with that for disc \ion{H}{ii} regions with similar metallicity. We show that Seyfert~2 nuclei follow a similar (N/O)-(O/H) relation to the one followed by star-forming objects. Finally, we find that active galaxies called as 'nitrogen-loud' observed at very high redshift ($z \: > \: 5$) show N/O values in consonance with those derived for local NLRs. This result indicates that the main star-formation event is completed in the early evolution stages of active galaxies.

Introduction. Pneumonia is a common infectious disease among children, very familiar to pediatricians and a major cause of hospitalization worldwide. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) - atypical pathogen, is estimated to be responsible for approximately 30-40% of community-acquired pneumonias. The aim of the paper was to underline the diagnostic and treatment difficulties in a case of pneumonia with M. pneumoniae in a school-aged boy, with multiple presentations in the Emergency Service for respiratory difficulties. Material and method. We present the case of a 7 years and 10-month-old male patient, admitted to our clinic for wheezing, cough and dyspnea. Results. The clinical exam at admission pointed out influenced general status, wheezing, thoraco-abdominal swing, intercostal draft, sibilant and crackles, oxygen saturation 89%, tachycardia 134 beats/minute. The blood tests revealed mild leukocytosis, with neutrophilia, slightly increased inflammatory biomarkers. Considering the general status and the presence of functional respiratory syndrome, steroid and symptomatic anti-inflammatory treatment is initiated. However, the general condition remains stable, which required the widening of the spectrum of investigations with the performance of a chest CT noticing a pneumonic condensation with an air bronchogram located at the level of the right upper lobe. Considering the stationary respiratory functional syndrome and the radiological appearance of the pneumonia as well as the age, we performed serology for atypical germs and identified a positive titer of Ig M antibodies for M. pneumoniae by instituting Azithromycin po., but after 3 days, the evolution remains stationary, thus we changed the treatment with intravenous Levofloxacin, with a favorable subsequent evolution. Conclusions. Pneumonia with atypical pathogens such as M. pneumoniae is a well-defined and well-known pathology in the literature, but it still remains a condition that imposes multiple difficulties related to the diagnosis and therapeutic management of pediatric cases.

Abstract We report direct measurements of the magnetic field screening at the limits of the Meissner phase for two superconducting Nb samples. The samples are processed with two different surface treatments that have been developed for superconducting radio-frequency cavity applications — a “baseline” treatment and an oxygen-doping (“O-doping” ) treatment. The measurements show: 1) that the screening length is significantly longer in the “O-doping” sample compared to the “baseline” sample; 2) that the screening length near the limits of the Meissner phase increases with applied field; 3) the evolution of the screening profile as the material transitions from the Meissner phase to the mixed phase; and 4) a demonstration of the absence of any screening profile for the highest applied field, indicative of the full flux entering the sample. Measurements are performed utilizing the β -detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β -NMR) technique that allows depth resolved studies of the local magnetic field within the first 100 nm of the surface. The study takes advantage of the β -SRF beamline, a new facility at TRIUMF, Canada, where field levels up to 200 mT are available parallel to the sample surface to replicate radio frequency (RF) fields near the Meissner breakdown limits of Nb.

We present a scalable machine learning (ML) force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of cooperative Jahn-Teller (JT) systems. Large scale dynamical simulations of the JT model also shed light on the orbital ordering dynamics in colossal magnetoresistance manganites. The JT effect in these materials describes the distortion of local oxygen octahedra driven by a coupling to the orbital degrees of freedom of $e_g$ electrons. An effective electron-mediated interaction between the local JT modes leads to a structural transition and the emergence of long-range orbital order at low temperatures. Assuming the principle of locality, a deep-learning neural-network model is developed to accurately and efficiently predict the electron-induced forces that drive the dynamical evolution of JT phonons. A group-theoretical method is utilized to develop a descriptor that incorporates the combined orbital and lattice symmetry into the ML model. Large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations, enabled by the ML force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening dynamics of the composite JT distortion and orbital order after a thermal quench. The late-stage coarsening of orbital domains exhibits pronounced freezing behaviors which are likely related to the unusual morphology of the domain structures. Our work highlights a promising avenue for multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.

Advancing protonic ceramic electrochemical cell (PCEC) technology offers promise for a variety of energy applications, including membrane reactors, fuel cells, and electrolyzers. Computational modeling of PCECs requires tracking the movement of three mobile charge carriers: protons, oxygen vacancies, and small polarons to adequately predict the cell operating characteristics. This paper develops an experimentally validated, quasi-2D (1+ 1D), transient, dual-channel cell model based on a multiple-charged defect-conducting electrolyte. The new model advances predictive capabilities on a number of fronts. First, it reduces empiricism, simplifies integration of experimentally derived modeling parameters, and enables rapid model scale-up to large cell platforms. Additionally, it predicts the distribution of properties in the streamwise gas flow direction and cell faradaic efficiency over a wide range of operating cell conditions helping to establish the inlet gas conditions needed to produce a dry hydrogen product gas. Model simulation reveals that the evolution of steady-state, thermal-neutral voltages in a PCEC can significantly change from initial operating values due to a dynamic, complex interaction which arises from local decreases in faradaic efficiency. Insights from model-based performance predictions touch upon thermal management considerations and the means for regulating cell temperature when trying to achieve either adiabatic or quasi-isothermal PCEC operation.

Abstract In layered Li‐rich materials, over stoichiometric Li forms an ordered occupation of LiTM6 in TM layer, showing a honeycomb superstructure along [001] direction. At the atomic scale, the instability of the superstructure at high voltage is the root cause of problems such as capacity/voltage decay of Li‐rich materials. Here we report a Li‐rich material with a high Li/Ni disorder, these interlayer Ni atoms locate above the honeycomb superstructure and share adjacent O coordination with honeycomb TM. These Ni‐O bonds act as cable‐stayed bridge to the honeycomb plane, and improve the high‐voltage stability. The cable‐stayed honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by in‐situ X‐ray diffraction to have a unique cell evolution mechanism that it can alleviate interlaminar lattice strain by promoting in‐plane expansion along a‐axis and inhibiting c‐axis stretching. Electrochemical tests also demonstrate significantly improved long cycle performance after 500 cycles (86% for Li‐rich/Li half cell and 82% for Li‐rich/Si‐C full cell) and reduced irreversible oxygen release. This work proves the feasibility of achieving outstanding stability of lithium‐rich materials through superstructure regulation and provides new insights for the development of the next‐generation high‐energy‐density cathodes.

Vanadium (V) is ubiquitously distributed in environmental media, imposing toxic hazards to organisms in biogeosphere. This review focuses on a comprehensive summary of the ecological and human health risks ascribed to V pollution, based on existing V toxicity relevant publications. Lower doses of V (< 2 mg/L) is beneficial to plant growth, however, V reduces plant biomass, induces toxic effects on plant morphology and adversely affects the absorption of essential plant elements at higher levels (≥ 2 mg/L). Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced under V stress may be the main reason for V toxicity to terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Although V contributes to high-efficient biological nitrogen fixation as a co-factor, V alters microbial community structures and drives its evolution. V can also accumulate in and harm human bodies. Knowledge gaps and further perspectives in aspects of V risks are thereby proposed, such as more toxic data reports for deriving V environmental quality criteria, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of detoxification and tolerance of organisms to V for bioremediation applications, and exploring the medical potential of V with the prevention of V toxicity to humans. This review advances our understanding of the toxic effects of V in the ecosystem and inspires future efforts on V management as well as application.

Following the advancement of medically assisted reproduction (MAR) technology, and the rationale to extend the culture to the blastocyst stage, performing elective single embryo transfer (eSET), gamete quality and assessment have acquired large relevance in ART. Embryo quality is strictly correlated with gametes quality and culture conditions. Oocyte maturity assessment is therefore imperative for fertilization and embryo evolution. Mature oocytes at the metaphase II stage result in a higher fertilization rate compared to immature oocytes. Indeed, oocyte morphology evaluation represents an important and challenging task that may serve as a valuable prognostic tool for future embryo development and implantation potential. Different grading systems have been reported to assess human embryos, however, in many cases, it is still a major challenge to select the single embryo to transfer with the highest implantation potential. Further, eSET has conferred a challenge to embryologists, who must try to enhance embryo culture and selection to provide an adequate success rate, whilst reducing the overall number of embryos transferred. Above the standard morphological assessment, there are several invasive or non-invasive approaches for embryo selection such as preimplantation genetic testing, time-lapse technology, proteomics and metabolomics, as well as oxygen utilization and analysis of oxidative stress in culture medium. This short review is not designed to be a comprehensive review of all possible features that may influence oocyte quality. It does give, however, a brief overview and describes the prognostic value of the morphological characteristics of human oocytes on their developmental capacity following ART treatments.

The evolution of oxide inclusions and cleanliness control in Al-killed GCr15SiMn bearing steel was investigated using a combination of industrial tests and thermodynamic calculations during the secondary refining process. Three different refining conditions were employed in the LF process. With varying ranges of slag basicity (about 5.6–5.7, 4.8–4.9 and 3.9–4.3) and Al content (0.028–0.035 mass%, 0.023–0.025 mass% and 0.014–0.02 mass%), the total oxygen content in the steel after VD refining was measured as 0.0019 mass%, 0.0017 mass% and 0.0008 mass%, respectively. Throughout the refining process, the inclusions underwent a transformation from MgO-Al 2 O 3 (or Al 2 O 3 ) into CaO-Al 2 O 3 (-MgO), and eventually to CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 inclusions. Furthermore, it was observed that under high Al content and slag basicity refining conditions, a significant number of inclusions in VD treatment were formed and transformed into CaO·Al 2 O 3 ·SiO 2 inclusions enriched with 60 mass% CaO. This indicated that when the proportion of CaO in calcium aluminates exceeded 45 mass%, there was an increased risk of larger-sized inclusions. Conversely, refining conditions with a slag basicity of 3.9–4.3 and an Al content of 0.014–0.02 mass% demonstrated effective inclusion control, resulting in lower number density, smaller sizes within 10 μm and an average composition located in the liquid region. This study carries important practical significance for the smelting of high cleanliness GCr15SiMn bearing steel.

Peroxiredoxins are a group of antioxidant enzymes that play a crucial role in eliminating hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produced during cellular metabolism. In conditions such as tissue ischemia/reperfusion, H 2 O 2 production is heightened. This scenario is recurrent in aquatic mammals, such as cetaceans and pinnipeds, when they perform breath-hold dives that lead to depletion of oxygen stores and cell hypoxia due to prolonged submersion. In such circumstances, peroxiredoxins are essential for regulating metabolism and preventing oxidative damage. Thus, our objective was to investigate evolutionary patterns of the peroxiredoxin gene family among aquatic mammalian species. Accordingly, we identified the number of ortholog and paralog genes among mammals, examining events of gene duplication, patterns of chromosomal distribution, and adaptive selection. We found that most subtypes of peroxiredoxins are characterized by single-copy genes with minimal missing data, with PRDX1, the most highly expressed subtype found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, exhibiting an increase in gene copies in aquatic mammals, particularly in pinnipeds. The distribution of the copies was dispersed along the genome and the majority were retrocopies of the main coding sequence with little divergence among them. We also found evidence of positive selection in the PRDX3 gene, especially in a convergent mutation among two deepest-diving species, cuvier’s beaked whale and southern elephant seal in which the amino acid had radical physical-chemical property change, possibly affecting the protein function. These results suggest that the peroxiredoxin gene family has a role in the evolution of aquatic mammals by reducing oxidative damage intrinsic to diving behavior in these species.

Abstract High‐entropy alloys (HEAs) confine multifarious elements into the same lattice, leading to intense lattice distortion effect. The lattice distortion tends to induce local microstrain at atomic level and thus affect surface adsorptions towards different adsorbates in various electrocatalytic reactions, yet remains unexplored. Herein, we report a class of sub‐2 nm IrRuRhMoW HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with distinct local microstrain induced by lattice distortion for boosting alkaline hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and evolution reactions (HER). We demonstrate that the distortion‐rich HEA catalysts with optimized electronic structure can downshift the d‐band center and generate uncoordinated oxygen sites to enhance the surface oxophilicity. As a result, the IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs show a remarkable HOR kinetic current density of 8.09 mA μg ‐1 PGM at 50 mV versus RHE, 8.89, 22.47 times higher than those of IrRuRh NPs without internal strain and commercial Pt/C, respectively, which is the best value among all the reported non‐Pt based catalysts. IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs also display great HER performances with a TOF value of 5.93 H 2 s ‐1 at 70 mV versus RHE, 4.6‐fold higher than that of Pt/C catalyst, exceeding most noble metal‐based catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical studies collectively confirm that weakened hydrogen (H ad ) and enhanced hydroxyl (OH ad ) adsorption are achieved by simultaneously modulating the hydrogen adsorption binding energy and surface oxophilicity originated from intensified ligand effect and microstrain effect over IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs, which guarantees the remarkable performances toward HOR/HER.

The analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of [${\alpha}$/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-${\alpha}$ and low-${\alpha}$ sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality, invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration. Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H], thus confirming previous suggestions by Gratton et al. (1996) and Fuhrmann (1998). Then we try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models. We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking also into account possible accretion of dwarf satellites. The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] exhibit a sharp increase of [Fe/$\alpha$] at a nearly constant [$\alpha$/H] (where $\alpha$ elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. A chemical model predicting a stop in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and where the high-$\alpha$ disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy can well explain the observations.

During the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), interstitial proton intercalation readily occurs in some transition metal oxide (TMO) catalysts and changes their d-band electronic structure. This work fabricated phosphorus (P)-doped tungsten oxide (WO3) with enriched oxygen vacancies (OVs) to study the impact of proton intercalation and heteroatom doping on eNRR and HER. Our results demonstrated that the electronic structure of the P-OV-WO3 catalyst was altered by in situ proton intercalation as indicated by the greater negative onset potential of eNRR at −0.05 V compared to the proton intercalation potential of 0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Compared to the non-P-doped WO3, the introduction of P doping in WO3 (e.g., 4.8 at. %) led to a reduction of more than 36% in proton intercalation. As a result, the HER activity of the P-OV-WO3 was significantly suppressed, as demonstrated by a considerably negative shift of the onset HER potential from −0.06 to −0.15 V and a slower HER kinetics with the Tafel slope increased from 129.0 to 343.1 mV/dec. Density functional theory calculations revealed the synergy of the proton intercalation, substitutional P doping, and the associated OVs in the improvement of N2 activation and hydrogenation in eNRR. The increased eNRR and the suppressed HER led to a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 64.1% and the NH3 yield of 24.5 μg·mg cat–1 h–1 at −0.15 V versus RHE in H2SO4 (pH = 2) as the electrolyte. The specific NH3 yield is more than 20 times higher than that of C-WO3 (1.1 μg·mg cat–1 h–1 with a FE of 20%). The results exceed most of the reported eNRR performances for TMO-based catalysts. Thus, the synergistic proton intercalation and P doping could lead to newer designs and applications of TMO-based catalysts for improved eNRR while suppressing the competing HER.

Abstract Estimates of oxygen fugacity of eclogitic rocks are linked to the redox evolution of the oceanic protolith during subduction and its residence in the lithospheric mantle, and, based on knowledge of pressures and temperatures, allow modelling of the speciation of volatile elements and diamond (or graphite) versus carbonate stability. To date, the oxygen fugacity of mantle eclogites has been shown to vary between -6 (Kasai, Congo and Udachnaya, Siberia) and -0.1 (Udachnaya, Siberia) log units (relative to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer, FMQ), linked to the low Fe3+ contents of garnets. In this study we investigated the Fe oxidation state of coexisting garnet and clinopyroxene hand-picked out of 17 diamond-free high-MgO and low-MgO mantle eclogites (dated at 2.84 Ga) from the V. Grib kimberlite pipe (East-European platform). Measured Fe3+/∑Fe values range between 0.03 and 0.19 for garnet and 0.18 to 0.38 for clinopyroxene, the former being higher than what was measured previously in garnets equilibrated at mantle conditions. The Fe3+/∑Fe of the reconstructed bulk rock ranges between 0.10 and 0.15 for high-MgO eclogites and 0.10 and 0.24 for low-MgO eclogites (with uncertainties of ± 0.02 and ± 0.03 in both cases). Thermobarometric calculations result in equilibration pressures and temperatures of 3.0 - 5.2 (± 0.4) GPa and 720 - 1050 (± 60) °C for both high-MgO and low-MgO eclogites, slightly lower than previous P-T estimates of mantle eclogites from the Udachnaya kimberlite pipe (Siberian craton). At these conditions, ∆logfo2 (FMQ) calculated using the available oxythermobarometric model varies from -1.7 to -0.6 log units for high-MgO eclogites and from -2.9 to 0.9 log units for low-MgO eclogites. Samples recording ∆logfo2 (FMQ) ≤ -1 log units overlap with North Slave, West Africa and Udachnaya eclogites, with no difference among eclogite types. The average values of -1.2 (± 0.4) log units for high-MgO and -0.6 (± 1.1) log units for low-MgO eclogites suggest different redox conditions of basaltic protoliths during subduction worldwide. Previous geochemical studies on the same rock samples reported evidence of cryptic metasomatism in both garnet and clinopyroxene that we demonstrate being not recorded by their major elements, while modal metasomatism evidenced by the presence of phlogopite as a product of interaction with a kimberlitic melt only affects the MgO of the bulk rock. Therefore, we suggest that high Fe3+/∑Fe ratios for garnet (&gt; 0.10) and for reconstructed bulk rocks in the case of both low-MgO and high-MgO samples cannot be due to metasomatic interaction with an oxidized fluid, but rather are the consequence of Fe3+ redistribution in an unusually oxidized mafic protolith upon metamorphism. Our results highlight the redox variability of eclogites of Archaean age at conditions more oxidized than present-day MORBs and imply an oxidizing nature of the convective mantle source where magma was formed with consequent speciation of C in the form of carbonate fluid explaining, therefore, the lack of diamonds in V. Grib kimberlite pipe.

Abstract Background and Aims kidney failure is a frequent reason for emergency department (ED) visits. Patients may require emergency hemodialysis and this situation may increases mortality risk. We set out to study the clinical relevance and biological characteristics of patients with renal failure presenting to the emergency department with an indication for emergency hemodialysis. Method A prospective observational study conducted in ED conducted over a 6-month period. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older and suffering from acute or chronic renal insufficiency defined by creatinine clearance (CrCL) calculated by MDRD&lt;60 ml/min. Information is recorded on demographics, clinical profile, clinical presentation, laboratory, causes of for emergency hemodialysis and in-hospital complications. Results Eighty one patients were enrolled, among them 61.7% patients had an indication for emergency hemodialysis. Mean age was 61± 12, sex-ratio=1,7. Sixty seven patients (82.7%) were known to have a chronic kidney failure and 17.3 % were discovered at the emergency department at the same hospitalisation period. Clinical profile (%): Anuric patients (11.1), preserved diuresis (40.7). Clinical presentation (%): deterioration of general condition (35.8), dyspnea and chest pain (21) and fever (17.3). Clinical examination showed a peripheral oxygen saturation between 70 and 100% with a mean of 94.81, a respiratory rhythm mean of 20 cycles/min, a systolic blood pressure mean of 134.61 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure mean of 70 mmHg. biological exams showed that kalemia was between 2.4 and 8.6 and 45 of those patients had kalemia more or equal to 5.5. Twelve per cent of these patients had hyperkalemia signs on the electrocardiogram. The average were 28 mmol/l with a maximum of 83.3 mmol/l. Creatinine values were between 185 et 2620 μmol/l with a median of 81. The value of Ph was between 7.04 and 7.53 with a median of 7.29 mm Hg. The value of HCO3- value was between 4.6 and 28.4 with a median of 14.2. Causes of emergency hemodialysis were acidosis in 12 cases, severe anemia with blood transfusion in 4 cases, hyperkalemia in 10 cases, acute pulmonary oedema in 5 cases and acute renal failure in 6 cases .the evolution of the patients was marked by improvement of 61.7% of the patients, only 3 of the 81 patients died during the hospitalization. Conclusion This study showed that the causes of emergency dialysis can be avoided by improving care and educating patients to improve the prognosis.
