Abstract Seawater direct electrolysis (SDE) using renewable energy provides a sustainable pathway to harness abundant oceanic hydrogen resources. However, the side-reaction of the chlorine electro-oxidation reaction (ClOR) severely decreased direct electrolysis efficiency of seawater and gradually corrodes the anode. In this study, a redox-mediated strategy is introduced to suppress the ClOR, and a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis (DSDE) system incorporating a separate O 2 evolution reactor is established. Ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN) 6 ] 3−/4− ) serves as an electron-mediator between the cell and the reactor, thereby enabling a more dynamically favorable half-reaction to supplant the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This alteration involves a straightforward, single-electron-transfer anodic reaction without gas precipitation and effectively eliminates the generation of chlorine-containing byproducts. By operating at low voltages (~1.37 V at 10 mA cm −2 and ~1.57 V at 100 mA cm −2 ) and maintaining stability even in a Cl − -saturated seawater electrolyte, this system has the potential of undergoing decoupled seawater electrolysis with zero chlorine emissions. Further improvements in the high-performance redox-mediators and catalysts can provide enhanced cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the DSDE system.

Abstract The construction of sub‐nanometer cluster catalysts (<1 nm) with almost complete exposure of active atoms serves as a promising avenue for the simultaneous enhancement of atom utilization efficiency and specific activity. Herein, a core–shell cobalt‐cerium bimetallic oxide protected by high coverage sub‐nanometer Ir clusters (denoted as Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 ) is constructed by a confined in situ exsolution strategy. The distinctive core–shell structure endows Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 with enhanced intrinsic activity and high conductivity, facilitating efficient charge transfer and full‐pH water splitting. The Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 achieves low overpotentials of 49/215, 52/390, and 54/243 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 , 1.0 m PBS, and 1.0 m KOH, respectively. The small decline in performance after 300 h of operation renders it one of the most effective catalysts for full‐pH water splitting. DFT calculations indicate that oriented electron transfer (along the path from Ce to Co and then to Ir) creates an electron‐rich environment for surface Ir clusters. The reconstructed interface electronic environment provides optimized intermediates adsorption/desorption energy at the Ir site (for HER) and at the Ir‐Co site (for OER), thus simultaneously speeding up the HER/OER kinetics.

Metal–support interaction (MSI) is pivotal and ubiquitously used in the development of next-generation catalysts, offering a pathway to enhance both catalytic activity and stability. However, owing to the lattice mismatch and poor solubility, traditional catalysts often exhibit a metal-on-support heterogeneous structure with limited interfaces and interaction and, consequently, a compromised enhancement of properties. Herein, we report a universal and tunable method for supersaturated doping of transition-metal carbides via strongly nonequilibrium carbothermal shock synthesis, characterized by rapid heating and swift quenching. Our results enable ∼20 at. % Ni2FeCo doping in Mo2C, significantly surpassing the thermodynamic equilibrium limit of <3 at. %. The supersaturation ensures more catalytically active NiFeCo doping and sufficient interaction with Mo2C, resulting in the maximized MSI (Max-MSI) effect. The Max-MSI enables outstanding activity and particularly stability in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction, showing an overpotential of 284 mV at 100 mA cm–2 and stable for 700 h, while individual Ni2FeCo and Mo2C only last less than 70 and 10 h (completely dissolved), respectively. In particular, the SD-Mo2C catalyst also exhibits excellent durability at 100 mA cm–2 for up to 400 h in 7 M KOH. Such a significantly improved stability is attributed to the supersaturated doping that led to each Mo atom strongly binding with adjacent heteroatoms, thus elevating the dissolution potential and corrosion resistance of Mo2C at a high current density. Additionally, the highly dispersed NiFeCo also facilitates the formation of dense oxyhydroxide coating during reconstruction, further protecting the integrated catalysts for durable operation. Furthermore, the synthesis has been successfully scaled up to fabricate large (16 cm2) electrodes and is adaptable to nickel foam substrates, indicating promising industrial applications. Our strategy allows the general and versatile production of various highly doped transition-metal carbides, such as Ni2FeCo-doped TiC, NbC, and W2C, thus unlocking the potential of maximized or adjustable MSI for diverse catalytic applications.

Developing stable and active electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency, which sluggish kinetics hinders sustainable hydrogen production. High entropy selenides (HESes) features with random distribution of multiple metals cations and unique electronic and size effect of Se anion, allowing for precious regulation of their catalytic properties towards high OER activity. In this work, we report a series of high‐entropy selenides catalysts with tunable lattice strain for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. Electrochemical measurements show that the quinary (NiCoMnMoFe)Sex requires only 291 mV to reach 10 mA cm‐2 and exhibits a superior stability with negligible current decay during 100 h’s continuous operation. By combining experimental measurements and theoretical calculation, the study reveals that the lattice distortion, reflected by the local microstrain near the active site, plays a vital role in boosting the OER activity of HESes.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is considered an ideal green hydrogen production technology with promising application prospects. However, the development of efficient and stable acid electroanalytic oxygen electrocatalysts is still a challenging bottleneck. This progress is achieved by adopting a strategic approach with the introduction of the high valence metal Ta to regulate the electronic configuration of RuO2 by manipulating its local microenvironment to optimize the stability and activity of the electrocatalysts. The Ta-RuO2 catalysts are notable for their excellent electrocatalytic activity, as evidenced by an overpotential of only 202 mV at 10 mA cm–2, which significantly exceeds that of homemade RuO2 and commercial RuO2. Furthermore, the Ta-RuO2 catalyst exhibits exceptional stability with negligible potential reduction observed after 50 h of electrolysis. Theoretical calculations show that the asymmetric configuration of Ru–O–Ta breaks the thermodynamic activity limitations usually associated with adsorption evolution, weakening the energy barrier for the formation of the OOH* formation. The strategic approach presented in this study provides an important reference for the development of a stable active center for acid water splitting.

Innovative electrode design is critical for improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and meeting rising global energy demands. Despite the development of numerous carbon materials for water splitting, their potential is hampered by sluggish kinetics, primarily due to high activation energy compounded by various smaller factors, including additives or binders used in electrode modification. To address these limitations, a catalyst‐free plastic chip electrode (PCE) for OER is developed. PCE is functionalized by oxidizing it in acidic media at 1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl and eliminates the need for additives, offering a more accurate industrial representation. The oxidation process enhances the electrode's surface area and introduces electrochemically active oxygen‐containing functional groups. Characterization of the modified PCE is conducted using scanning electron microscope, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, Raman, and thermogravimetric analysis, while electrolyte analysis utilizes UV–vis spectroscopy and NMR. The PCE oxidized for 6 h (PCE@6) demonstrates improved OER performance, with an onset overpotential of 260 mV, an overpotential of 1.06 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at 10 mA cm −2 , and a Tafel slope of 494 mV decade −1 . The modified PCE reduces overpotential and minimizes bubble formation, enhancing efficiency and showcasing its potential as a cost‐effective solution for alkaline water electrolysis systems.

A novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst was prepared by a synthesis strategy consisting of the solvothermal growth of Ni3S2 nanostructures on Ni foam, followed by hydrothermal incorporation of Fe species (Fe–Ni3S2/Ni foam). This electrocatalyst displayed a low OER overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA·cm–2, a low Tafel slope of 43 mV·dec–1, and constant performance at an industrially relevant current density (500 mA·cm–2) over 100 h in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, despite a minor loss of Fe in the process. Based on a detailed characterization by (in situ) Raman spectroscopy, (quasi-in situ) XPS, SEM, TEM, XRD, ICP-AES, EIS, and Cdl analysis, the high OER activity and stability of Fe–Ni3S2/Ni foam were attributed to the nanostructuring of the surface in the form of stable nanosheets and to the combination of Ni3S2 granting suitable electrical conductivity with newly formed NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides at the surface of the material providing the active sites for OER.

Abstract Here, low-crystalline ruthenium oxide (S-RuO x ) with abundant oxygen vacancies was synthesized, after which its activity and selectivity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in additive-free brine solution were compared with those of commercial ruthenium(IV) dioxide (C-RuO 2 ), a benchmark catalyst for OER in an alkaline electrolyte. S-RuO x delivered a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at a significantly low overpotential (465 mV) in a 0.5 M NaCl solution without requiring an alkali. The estimated Faradaic efficiency toward chloride oxidation reaction (COR), FE(COR), was 2%, and exceptional OER was achieved without generating chlorine oxide species. This sharply contrasts the fact that C-RuO 2 required an overpotential of 525 mV to generate 10 mA cm −2 , where the FE(COR) was 59%. The activity and selectivity toward OER decreased after reducing the oxygen vacancies by sintering S-RuO x at different temperatures. S-RuO x continued to generate 10 mA cm −2 in 0.5 M NaCl solution for ≥60 h while maintaining the increasing potential at <30 mV. However, FE(COR) increased from a few percent for 20h to 34% probably because of an irreversible decrease in vacancies. Notably, the addition of an alkali or a buffer could only enhance OER.    

    

## Coastal <i>Synechococcus</i> strains can exploit low oxygen habitats

We found that PhycoErythrin-rich <i>Synechococcus</i> achieved faster growth rates (µ), across the spectral bandwidths from 405 – 730 nm, under 2.5 µM [O<sub>2</sub>], characteristic of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs), than under 250 µM [O<sub>2</sub>], whereas PhycoCyanin-rich strain showed generally similar µ under 2.5 and 250 µM [O<sub>2</sub>]. For PhycoCyanin- and PhycoErythrin-rich <i>Synechococcus</i>, µ showed also positive linear responses to both Phycobiliproteins:Chlorophyll <i>a</i>, and to cumulative diel PSII electron flux, although the relations vary across strain and [O<sub>2</sub>]. Electron transport downstream of Photosystem II was generally higher for both PhycoCyanin- and PhycoErythrin-rich strains under 250 µM [O<sub>2</sub>], since cyanobacteria show strong capacity for electron flow away from PSII to O<sub>2</sub>, particularly under excess excitation. Even though electron transport was faster under 250 µM [O<sub>2</sub>], the PhycoErythrin-rich strain showed a higher growth yield of electron transport under 2.5 µM [O<sub>2</sub>]. PhycoErythrin-rich <i>Synechococcus</i> are currently typically found at greater depths, and lower light, than are PhycoCyanin-rich strains, but we suggest that the PhycoErythrin-rich strains are actually limited to lower light by an interaction between light and full air-saturated [O<sub>2</sub>]. In expanding Oxygen Minimum Zones PhycoErythrin-rich strains will likely exploit higher light niches, across a wider spectral range.

There is a great deal of interest in the development of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that are stable and have high activity because this anodic half-reaction is the main bottleneck in water splitting and other key technologies. Cobalt and iron oxide and oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts constitute a cheaper alternative to the highly active and commonly used Ir- and Ru-based catalysts. Most of the described electrocatalysts require tedious synthetic and expensive preparation procedures. We report here a facile and straightforward preparation of an electrocatalyst by a combination of commercial compounds, such as cobalt chloride and ferrocene. A highly active and stable OER electrocatalyst is obtained, which shows a low overpotential in the alkaline medium as a consequence of a synergistic effect between both compounds and is inexpensive.

Abstract Photothermocatalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM) offers a promising strategy for converting solar energy into fuel. However, the high light intensity required for high fuel production rates and thermodynamically more favorable coking side reactions limit this strategy. Herein, a nanocomposite of La‐doped Al 2 O 3 supporting Ru nanoparticles (NPs) (Ru/La‐Al 2 O 3 ) is synthesized. At relatively low light intensity (80.2 kW m −2 ), Ru/La‐Al 2 O 3 obtains high production rates of CO and H 2 per gram of Ru ( r Ru, CO and r Ru, H2 , 8410.19 and 7181.94 mmol g Ru −1 min −1 ) with light‐to‐fuel efficiency ( η , 26.6%), and completely prohibits coking. In striking contrast, the reference catalyst without La doping (Ru/Al 2 O 3 ) exhibits lower r Ru, CO , r Ru, H2 , η and produces large amounts of coke. The improved photothermocatalytic performance stems from the fact that reactive oxygen species and carbonate species are involved in the oxidation of carbon species (rate‐determining steps of DRM) through two different reaction pathways, which significantly increases catalytic activity and prevents the carbon species from polymerizing into coke. Additionally, light not only enhances the DRM on Ru NPs and the oxidation reaction between carbonate species and carbon species but also promotes the dissociation of CH 4 and desorption of H 2 , which improves the catalytic activity and product selectivity of Ru/La‐Al 2 O 3 .

Realizing efficient and durable non‐precious metal‐based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a great challenge. Here, a multi‐component composite of Co2P2O7‐MoN/NC containing pyrophosphate, nitride, and nitrogen‐doped carbon is successfully prepared via a facile two‐step synthesis method. Combining the structural regulation between the active metal‐ and non‐metal‐based species, Co2P2O7‐MoN/NC demonstrates superior activity and durability for OER, requiring an overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 83.3 mV dec−1, and long‐term stability over 100 h in an alkaline solution. Post‐characterizations reveal that synergistic effect among stable Co2P2O7, partially dissolved MoN, N‐doped carbon, and new‐formed CoOOH nanosheets enable structural reconstruction, fast charge transfer, and formation of oxygen‐containing intermediates, promoting the OER performance significantly. This work provides a promising pathway to tune multi‐components to fabricate efficient transition‐metal‐based electrocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

Enhancing the efficiencies of electrochemical reactions for converting renewable energy into clean chemical fuels as well as generating clean energy is critical to achieving carbon neutrality. However, this enhancement can be achieved using materials that are not constrained by resource limitations and those that can be converted into devices in a scalable manner, preferably for industrial applications. This review explores the applications of electrochemically deposited manganese dioxides (MnO2) and their composites as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions for converting renewable energy into chemical fuels. It also explores their applications as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and bifunctional OER/ORR for the efficient operation of fuel cells and metal–air batteries, respectively. Manganese is the second most abundant transition metal in the Earth’s crust, and electrodeposition represents a binder‐free and scalable technique for fabricating devices (electrodes). To propose an improved catalyst design, the studies on the electrodeposition mechanism of MnO2 as well as the fabrication techniques for MnO2‐based nanocomposites accumulated in the development of electrodes for supercapacitors are also included in this review.

In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high‐valent transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high‐valent metal sites, particularly in high‐current‐density water‐splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co‐O‐Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt‐iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe‐PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co‐O‐Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double‐exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high‐valent Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low‐valent state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe‐PBA‐30) requires an overpotential of only 276 mV to achieve 1000 mA cm‐2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe‐PBA‐30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1 A cm‐2 at 1.76 V and continuously operates for 250 hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.

We investigated the composition-activity relationship of porous FeNi alloy foams for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We compared conventional transient behavior using cyclic voltammetry with the performance at high geometric current densities up to 3.0 A cm-2 achieved at quasi steady-state conditions employing pulsed electrolysis. The experiments were performed under setup parameters, we introduce as dry anode conditions for anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers. In this context, a dry anode refers to an electrode setup in which the catalyst is not directly submerged in a liquid medium, unlike conventional electrodes fed with an alkaline electrolyte. Instead, the anode is purged with humidified gas. Eleven different compositions in the FeNi alloy space (93 – 2 at. % Fe) were synthesized using the hydrogen bubble template method, resulting in porous foams with similar structures. A rigorous statistical analysis of all measured data was conducted to ensure reproducibility. The influence of bubble formation on the solution resistance is elucidated and, consequently, the apparent performance is assessed. The most efficient alloy composition required an averaged mean potential of 1.82 VRHE for 3 A cm-2 under quasi steady-state conditions.

The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3‐ to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a‐c) heterojunction. Taking a‐c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3·H2O (Ni‐FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3‐ are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a‐c Fe(Ni)OOH during OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a‐c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni‐FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303 mV and high durability of 500 hours at 500 mA cm‐2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100 hours under a high operating current of 8000 mA.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to sustainable energy and environmental engineering, thus necessitating rational design of high-performing electrocatalysts that requires understanding the structure-performance relationship with a possible dynamic nature under working conditions. Herein, we uncover a novel type of OER mechanisms thrust by the fleeting active sites (FASs) dynamically formed on Ni-based layered double hydroxides (Ni-LDHs) by Fe cations from the electrolyte under OER potentials. We employ grand-canonical ensemble methods and microkinetic modeling to elucidate the potential-dependent structures of FASs on Ni-LDHs and demonstrate that the fleeting-active-site-thrust (FAST) mechanism delivers superior OER activity via the FAST intramolecular oxygen coupling pathway, which also suppresses the lattice oxygen mechanism, leading to improved operando stability of Ni-LDHs. We further reveal that introducing only trace-level loadings (10-100 ppm) of FASs on Ni-LDHs can significantly boost and govern the catalytic performance for OER. This underscores the crucial importance of considering the novel FAST mechanism in OER and also suggests the electrolyte as a key part of the structure-performance relationship as well as an effective design strategy via engineering the electrolyte.

The utilization of oxygen transport membranes enables the production of high-purity hydrogen by the thermal decomposition of water below 1000 °C. This process is based on a chemical potential gradient across the membrane, which is usually achieved by introducing a reducing gas. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used to model reactors based on this concept. In this study, a modelling approach for water splitting is presented in which oxygen transport through the membrane acts as the rate-determining process for the overall reaction. This transport step is implemented in the CFD simulation. Both gas compartments are modelled in the simulations. Hydrogen and methane are used as reducing gases. The model is validated using experimental data from the literature and compared with a simplified perfect mixing modelling approach. Although the main focus of this work is to propose an approach to implement the water splitting in CFD simulations, a simulation study was conducted to exemplify how CFD modelling can be utilized in design optimization. Simplified 2-dimensional and rotational symmetric reactor geometries were compared. This study shows that a parallel overflow of the membrane in an elongated reactor is advantageous, as this reduces the back diffusion of the reaction products, which increases the mean driving force for oxygen transport through the membrane.

NiFe electrocatalysts are among the most active phases for water splitting with regard to the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The interplay between Ni and Fe, both at the surface and in the subsurface of the catalyst, is crucial to understanding such outstanding properties and remains a subject of debate. Various phenomena, ranging from the formation of oxides/(oxy)hydroxides to the associated segregation of certain species, occur during the electrochemical reactions and add another dimension of complexity that hinders the rational design of electrodes for water splitting. In this work, we have developed the procedure for the quantification of chemical depth profiling by XPS/HAXPES measurements and applied it to two NiFe electrodes with different porosities. The main outcome of this study is related to the surface reconstruction of the electrodes during the OER, followed at two different depths by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We find that Fe initially segregates at the surface when exposed to ambient conditions, resulting in the formation of an inactive FeO

Rechargeable zinc‐air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi‐functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi‐functional catalyst (rGO‐CoFe2O4/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO‐CoFe2O4) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO‐CoFe2O4/Co with the in‐situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half‐wave potential is 0.81 V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310 mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc‐air batteries assembled with rGO‐CoFe2O4/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9 mW cm‐2) and cycling stability compared to rGO‐CoFe2O4 and commercial Pt/C‐RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.

Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising low-cost strategy for clean and sustainable hydrogen production but is largely limited by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the challenges in maintaining adequate separation between H2 and O2. Here, we reveal an anodic-cathodic sequential oxygen evolution process via electrochemical oxidation and subsequent reduction of Ni hydroxides, enabling much lower overpotentials than conventional anodic oxygen evolution. By using (isotope-labeled) differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations, we evidence that the sequential oxygen evolution originates from the electrochemical oxidation of Ni hydroxides to NiOO– active species while undergoing a different, reductive step of NiOO– for the final release of O2 due to weakened Ni–O covalency. Based on this sequential process, we propose and demonstrate a hybrid water electrolysis and energy storage device, which enables time-decoupled hydrogen and oxygen evolution and electrochemical energy storage in the Ni hydroxides. The authors report a sequential oxygen evolution process via electrochemical oxidation and reduction of Ni hydroxides, allowing for decoupled oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution during water splitting and energy storage in the Ni hydroxides.

Manganese is a key metal involved in the catalysis of natural photosynthesis. Thus, the investigation of Mn‐based electrocatalysts for water oxidation is of high importance. This work reports the doping of Mo into α‐MnO2 nanorods to improve the water oxidation performance. The doping of Mo can transform the microstructure of α‐MnO2 from nanorods into nanosphere superstructures. As a dopant, Mo expands the α‐MnO2 lattice to result in a decrease in the average oxidation state of Mn and the generation of oxygen vacancies, which are beneficial to water oxidation catalysis. Under optimized doping, the OER overpotential of Mo/α‐MnO2 is reduced by 80 mV (at 10 mA/cm2) compared with pure α‐MnO2.

NiFe-based nanomaterials have emerged as highly promising catalysts to replace platinum, ruthenium and iridium for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in “green hydrogen” production process through water splitting. Using iron (2+) sulfate and nickel acetate as the raw materials, with the molar ratio of Ni acetate to iron (2+) sulfate controlled at 8:5, the concentration of metal-ion was 0.6 mol/L, and precursor fibers rich in Ni2+, Fe2+, and SO4 2− were prepared using electrospinning technology, with polyvinyl alcohol acting as the colloid. Subsequently, composite nanorods rich in the elements of Ni, Fe, S, and C were successfully obtained at a heat treatment temperature of 1000°C in an Ar gas atmosphere. The results demonstrate that the nanorod samples possessed a surface diameter of ~200 nm, and the main phases of the nanorods after heat treatment at 1000°C included FeNi3 alloy, (Fe,Ni)9S8, Ni4S3, and amorphous C. Electrochemical performance tests conducted in a 1.0 mol/L KOH solution exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction properties of the catalysts prepared using FeNi3/(Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni4S3/C nanorods as the materials. The overpotential was about 258.6 mV of the catalyst material at 10 mAcm−2.

The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3‐ to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a‐c) heterojunction. Taking a‐c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3·H2O (Ni‐FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3‐ are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a‐c Fe(Ni)OOH during OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a‐c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni‐FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303 mV and high durability of 500 hours at 500 mA cm‐2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100 hours under a high operating current of 8000 mA.

Abstract An in-depth understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms is essential for advancing electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The emerging oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) streamlines direct O–O radical coupling, circumventing the formation of oxygen vacancy defects characteristic of the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and bypassing additional reaction intermediates (*OOH) inherent to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). With only *O and *OH as intermediates, OPM-driven electrocatalysts stand out for their ability to disrupt traditional scaling relationships while ensuring stability. This review compiles the latest significant advances in OPM-based electrocatalysis, detailing design principles, synthetic methods, and sophisticated techniques to identify active sites and pathways. We conclude with prospective challenges and opportunities for OPM-driven electrocatalysts, aiming to advance the field into a new era by overcoming traditional constraints.

The need for efficient, economical, and clean energy systems is increasing, and as a result, interest in water-splitting techniques to produce green hydrogen is also increasing. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinders the practical application and widespread use of water-splitting technologies; therefore, to address this challenge, it is essential to develop cost-effective and efficient OER catalysts. In this work, we have synthesized an inexpensive and tunable FeCoMn Prussian blue analogue (PBAs) as an efficient OER catalyst via a straightforward process.

In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high‐valent transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high‐valent metal sites, particularly in high‐current‐density water‐splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co‐O‐Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt‐iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe‐PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co‐O‐Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double‐exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high‐valent Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low‐valent state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe‐PBA‐30) requires an overpotential of only 276 mV to achieve 1000 mA cm‐2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe‐PBA‐30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1 A cm‐2 at 1.76 V and continuously operates for 250 hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.

Evolving highly competent and economical electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis is crucial in renewable hydrogen energy technologies. The slow hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics under alkaline electrolytes, still, has troubled developments in high-performance green hydrogen production systems. Herein, we demonstrate the tailoring of the interface of earth-abundant transition-metal nanoclusters (MNCs), including iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu) nanoclusters on nickel oxide nanosheets (M NCs|NiO NS) through metal-support interaction for enriched overall water splitting under an alkaline electrolyte. The strong metal-metal oxide interaction allows alteration of the binding capabilities of hydrogen ions (*H) and hydroxyl ions (*OH) on Ni electrodes. Specifically, the robust interaction between Fe and NiO reveals optimized binding of H* and OH* energies, facilitating the water-splitting reaction under an alkaline electrolyte. In addition, the improved HER/OER catalytic activity is attained with the Fe NCs|NiO NS with small overpotentials of ∼62.0 and ∼380.0 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, a high mass activity of ∼90.0 A g

Currently, NiFe-LDH exhibits an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the interaction of the two metal elements on the layered double hydroxide (LDH) platform. However, such interaction is still insufficient to compensate for its poor electrical conductivity, limited number of active sites and sluggish dynamics. Herein, a feasible two-step hydrothermal strategy that involves coupling low-conductivity NiFe-LDH with 3D porous graphene aerogel (GA) is proposed. The optimized NiFe-LDH/GA (1:1) produced possesses a 257 mV (10 mA cm−2) overpotential and could operate stably for 56 h in an OER. Our investigation demonstrates that the NiFe-LDH/GA has a three-dimensional mesoporous structure, and that there is synergistic interaction between LDH and GA and interfacial reconstruction of NiOOH. Such an interface synergistic coupling effect promotes fast mass transfer and facilitates OER kinetics, and this work offers new insights into designing efficient and stable GA-based electrocatalysts.

Developing an OER electrocatalyst that balances high performance with low cost is crucial for widely adopting PEM water electrolyzers. Ru-based catalysts are gaining attention for their cost-effectiveness and high activity, positioning them as promising alternatives to Ir-based catalysts. However, Ru-based catalysts can be prone to oxidation at high potentials, compromising their durability. In this study, we utilize a simple synthesis method to synthesize a SnO2, Nb2O5, and RuO2 composite catalyst (SnO2/Nb2O5@RuO2) with multiple interfaces and abundant oxygen vacancies. The large surface area and numerous active sites of the SnO2/Nb2O5@RuO2 catalyst lead to outstanding acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, achieving current densities of 10, 50, and 200 mA cm−2 at ultralow overpotentials of 287, 359, and 534 mV, respectively, significantly surpassing commercial IrO2. Moreover, incorporating Nb2O5 into the SnO2/Nb2O5@RuO2 alters the electronic structure at the interfaces and generates a high density of oxygen vacancies, markedly enhancing durability. Consequently, the membrane electrode composed of SnO2/Nb2O5@RuO2 and commercial Pt/C demonstrated stable operation in the PEM cell for 25 days at an industrial current density of 1 A cm−2. This research presents a convenient approach for developing a highly efficient and durable Ru-based electrocatalyst, underscoring its potential for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

Chiral inorganic materials possess unique asymmetric properties that could significantly impact various fields. However, their practical application has been hindered by challenges in creating structurally robust chiral materials. We report the synthesis of well-defined chiral-shaped hollow cobalt oxide nanostructures, extendable to a family of chalcogenides including sulfide, selenide, and telluride through topological transformations. Taking chiral cobalt oxide nanostructures as a representative material, we demonstrate precise control over their chiral architectures, enabling fine-tuning of parameters, such as twist degrees, handedness, and compositions. These chiral nanostructures exhibit high spin selectivity effects that influence the electron transfer processes in catalytic reactions. Leveraging this spin-selective behavior, the chiral cobalt oxide nanoarchitectures demonstrate enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction compared to their achiral counterparts. Our findings not only expand the library of chiral inorganic materials but also advance the application of chiral effects in fields such as catalysis, spintronics, and beyond.

In this research, the electronic states, band structures, and bond properties of the framework compounds of CoPO4, Co1-xFexPO4, and Co1–xNixPO4 were investigated by the density functional theory calculations. The potential capabilities of these systems in the photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen were analyzed. The spin-up electron densities of states for the CoPO4, Co1–xFexPO4, and Co1–xNixPO4 systems have band gaps of 2.7, 3.4, and 3.45 eV, respectively. The band of spin-down electron states has several energy gaps above the Fermi level. The density of states of electron with spin up near the Fermi level is obviously greater than that of electrons with spin down. In this case, localized states of electrons appear in the band gap of doped semiconductors due to impurity atoms. The calculated value of the energy at the lower edge of the conduction band for CoPO4 was –0.7 eV, which is more negative than the energy required for water splitting. Meanwhile, the calculated value of the energy at the upper edge of the valence band was 2.01 eV, which is more positive than the oxygen evolution energy of 1.23 eV.

Abstract High‐efficient and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are desirable to Zn‐air batteries (ZABs). However, most of catalysts in powder form with sole active sites remain challenging in achieving the satisfactory bifunctional catalysis and suffer from peeling off during the long‐term operation. Herein, hybrid CoFe active sites are constructed containing nanoalloys (≈10 nm), clusters (< 2 nm), and single atoms on aerophilic carbon fiber membranes as binder‐free air cathodes for ultra‐long‐life ZABs. In particular, the high air‐permeability of membranes (0.2 s) can prevent the active sites from blocking by O 2 bubbles and promote the mass transfer. The theoretical and experimental results confirm that the hydrophilic CoFe 2 O 4 /CoFeOOH sites reconstructed on the surface of CoFe nanoalloys are mainly responsible for OER. While for single atoms and clusters on nitrogen (N)‐doped carbon matrix, they play a synergetic role in optimizing the adsorption energy to enhance ORR activity. Thus, the as‐prepared catalysts exhibit an ultra‐low ORR/OER potential gap (0.64 V). When further assembled as freestanding air‐electrodes, it exhibits an outstanding cycling lifespan of 1200 and 155 h in liquid‐ and quasi‐solid‐state ZABs respectively, which are fivefold and twofold higher than those of powder‐based cathodes (240/67 h).

Abstract The escalating global demand for clean and sustainable energy has ignited significant interest in hydrogen production through water splitting. A major challenge in this pursuit is the development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we present the synthesis of a novel two-dimensional d-Ti₃CN @CdSe nanocomposite, designed as a high-performance electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Synthesized via hydrothermal methods, the nanocomposite was characterized using advanced characterization techniques viz. Raman spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, and SEM/EDS. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate that the d-Ti₃CN @CdSe nanocomposite significantly enhances catalytic performance compared to its individual components, achieving a low overpotential of 232 mV for HER at 10 mA cm⁻² and reducing the OER overpotential from 498.3 mV for d-Ti₃CN MXene to 382.2 mV in the nanocomposite at 30 mA cm⁻². Additionally, it exhibits excellent stability, retaining about 75.37% of its current density after 36 hours of continuous operation. This remarkable performance is attributed to the synergistic interactions between CdSe nanoparticles and Ti₃CN MXene layers, which prevent restacking, increase the electrochemically active surface area, and enhance charge transfer efficiency. These features position the d-Ti₃CN @CdSe nanocomposite as a promising candidate for scalable and sustainable water-splitting applications.

Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para‐benzoquinone (p‐BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value‐added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p‐BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2‐supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5% and an excellent p‐BQ yield of 83.4% at pH 7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p‐BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction‐distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p‐BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol‐containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low‐carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.

Abstract Water oxidation, a crucial step in electrochemical water splitting, is often hindered by its complex kinetics. In our pursuit of designing efficient electrocatalysts, we have found that morphological modifications during synthesis are powerful tools. By manipulating various parameters, such as reaction time and temperature, we have tuned the morphology of the catalysts, leading to a significant enhancement in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rate. Our thorough research involves using a simple hydrothermal method for synthesizing bimetallic Ni–Cu oxides, resulting in the emergence of different morphologies by varying reaction times from 4 to 24 h. The OER performance in an alkaline medium, using a 1 M KOH solution, has been meticulously investigated, and our results have unveiled the highest activity for Ni–Cu fabricated with a growth time of 24 h. Ni–Cu oxide 24 exhibits a remarkably low onset potential for OER at 222 mV with a Tafel slope of 373 mV/dec. The catalyst boasts the lowest R ct value of 2.788 ohm, ensuring faster charge transfer rates and stability up to 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles, thereby supporting its electrochemical applications for water splitting.

The synthesized CuO@C is used as an efficient heterogeneous nanocatalyst for the synthesis of 2H-indazoles and quinazolines utilizing commercially available 2-bromobenzaldehydes, primary amines, and sodium azide under ligand-free and base-free conditions. The present methodology demonstrates the formation of new N–N, C–N, and C═N bonds under one-pot reaction conditions using PEG-400 as a green solvent. The reaction pathways are supported by control experiments and mechanistic elucidation. Further, the synthesized catalyst was characterized by a range of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques such as powdered X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, UV–vis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and BET-BJH analysis. Importantly, the study focused on the recyclability of the catalyst and successfully showed gram-scale production. Significantly, our active catalyst exhibited an outstanding performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, with an overpotential of 290 mV and a swallow Tafel slope of 91 mV dec–1.

In this study, the electronic engineering of a high-valent active site for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was achieved through the electrochemical pre-cathodic treatment method (EPCTM). This method involves applying a cathodic potential to the drop-cast working electrode of Mn-substituted nickel ferrite (Ni1−xMnxFe2O4; where x = 0.0, 0.2, and 0.4) electrocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed an increase in the ratios of Ni3+/Ni2+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ in Ni1−xMnxFe2O4 after EPCTM followed by OER, leading to an enhancement in electrochemical OER current density at 600 mV overpotential by 3.65 times for x = 0.0, 5.56 times for x = 0.20, and 4.72 times for x = 0.40. This enhancement was further supported by a decrease in the slope of the anodic Tafel equation after EPCTM, indicating improved efficiency of the interaction between the working electrode and electrolyte, as a lower Tafel slope suggests better charge exchange at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The positive slope in the Mott–Schottky (MS) plot for all Ni1−xMnxFe2O4 samples confirmed the p-type nature of the electrocatalysts. Additionally, the significant decrease in the slope of the linear portion of the MS plot indicated an increase in carrier concentration after electrochemical pre-cathodic treatment in all Ni1−xMnxFe2O4 samples. This increase in p-type carrier concentration supports the observed increase in the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio for OER after EPCTM.

Abstract Electronic structure regulation is a prevailing approach to modifying the electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet its impact on the co‐catalysts modified photoanodes remains uncertain. Herein, B‐modified NiFe‐LDH (NiFeB‐hydx) co‐catalyst in situ is immobilized onto Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 and emphasizes the effect of lower‐valence Ni (Ni 2‐δ ) in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) process. A flexible adjustment in the oxidation state of Ni from +2 to 0 by manipulating the Ni content and the corresponding B quantity is achieved. Interestingly, the Ni 0 significantly reduces the onset potential low to 0.53 V RHE , albeit leading to wasted holes due to incomplete redox transition. An optimal amount of Ni 2‐δ effectively facilitates the redox transition of Ni and achieves a delicate balance between hole extraction and consumption, substantially enhancing the PEC performance. Density functional theory calculations verifies the electron enrichment of Ni and the corresponding benefits for enhancing OER. Furthermore, introducing FeOOH as a hole transfer layer on Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 induces a pronounced band bending effect, remarkably promoting the meticulously engineered NiFeB‐hydx/FeOOH/Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 photoanode to a photocurrent density of 3.29 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V RHE . NiFeB‐hydx/FeOOH can be universally applied to the BiVO 4 photoanode, resulting in doubled photocurrent density (4.8 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V RHE ).

Abstract Colonisation of novel habitats are important events in evolution, but the factors that initially prompt such ecological transitions are often unknown. The invasion of land by fish is an extreme habitat transition that offers an opportunity to empirically investigate the causes of major ecological transitions. The intertidal ecotone—and rock pools in particular—have been an important staging ground for transitions onto land. Classic hypotheses focus on the adverse abiotic conditions of rock pools at low tide as the instigator of fish voluntarily stranding themselves out of water, which can then lead to the evolution of an amphibious lifestyle. To test these hypotheses, we studied the abiotic conditions of 54 rock pools on the island of Guam where there are various species of aquatic, amphibious and terrestrial blenny fishes. We found little support for the expected deterioration of abiotic conditions in standing pools at low tide (salinity, pH and oxygen), and fish were not seen to be excluded from those pools that were found to exhibit poor abiotic conditions (temperature, salinity and pH). Hypoxia was the only factor that might account for the absence of blennies from certain rock pools. Next, we experimentally measured oxygen depletion by an aquatic, mildly amphibious and highly amphibious species of blenny found on Guam in a simulated rockpool to infer the proportion of rock pools at low tide outside the tolerable range of blennies. Rock pools were found to have oxygen levels within the requirements of most blennies and those of other marine fishes reported in the literature. We conclude that the abiotic environment of rock pools alone was unlikely to have instigated the evolution of amphibious behaviour in blennies, at least on Guam. Instead, the broad range of abiotic conditions experienced in rock pools suggests these conditions could have primed amphibious blennies to better endure the novel conditions on land. Any ecotone typified by fluctuations or gradients in abiotic conditions is likely a key transitional environment for the invasion of novel habitats and, as such, are an important location for adaptive evolution and species diversification.

We describe the impact of post-annealing on ferroelectric-domain structures in arrays of BiFeO3 (BFO) epitaxial nanoislands, which exhibit a domain evolution from an initial 71° stripe/vortex domains to center-convergent topological domains. These results suggest that the increase and redistribution of charged defects, e.g., oxygen vacancies, in BFO nanoislands play a crucial role in driving the formation of center-type domain structures. The observation of defect-driven domain evolution in BFO nanoislands provides a path for further exploring their formation mechanism, topological properties, novel functionalities, and potential applications.

Abstract Oxygenic photosynthesis generates the initial energy source that fuels nearly all life on Earth. At the heart of the process are the photosystems, which are pigment binding multi-protein complexes that catalyse the first step of photochemical conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Here, we investigate the molecular evolution of the plastid-encoded photosystem subunits at single-residue resolution across 773 angiosperm species. We show that despite an extremely high level of conservation, 7% of residues in the photosystems, spanning all photosystem subunits, exhibit hallmarks of adaptive evolution. Through in silico modelling of these adaptive substitutions, we uncover the impact of these changes on the predicted properties of the photosystems, focussing on their effects on co-factor binding and inter-subunit interface formation. By analyzing these cohorts of changes, we reveal that evolution has repeatedly altered the interaction between photosystem II and its D1 subunit in a manner that is predicted to reduce the energetic barrier for D1 turnover and photosystem repair. Together, these results provide insight into the trajectory of photosystem adaptation during angiosperm evolution.

Highly enduring and methanol‐tolerant electrocatalysts are pertinent to revolutionizing direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) technologies. Transition metal‐based electrocatalysts are anticipated to rank among the remarkable electrocatalysts for boosting the sluggish Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, we report a facile approach to optimize the activity and stability of the AgCl‐CuO systems. The tailored Nano Particle‐Nano Rod (NP‐NR) and Nano Leaf (NL) like morphologies deliver remarkable bifunctional catalytic performance for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, sustained activity, and comparatively better stability for ORR. A meager shift of only 0.014 V and 0.024 V in the half‐wave potential is observed in the NP‐NR and NL structures, respectively, for the ORR even after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, both the AgCl‐CuO composite exhibits an excellent tolerance to methanol.

Detecting parasitic side reactions is paramount for developing stable cathode active materials (CAMs) for Li-ion batteries. This study presents a method for the quantification of released lattice oxygen and transition metal ions (TM II+ ions). It is based on a 3-electrode cell design employing a Vulcan carbon-based sense electrode (SE) that is held at a controlled voltage against a partially delithiated lithium iron phosphate (LFP) counter electrode (CE). At this SE, reductive currents can be measured while polarizing a CAM working electrode (WE), here a LiNi 0.80 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O 2 (NCA), against the same LFP CE. In voltammetric scans, we show how the SE potential can be selected to specifically detect a given side reaction during CAM charge/discharge, allowing, e.g., to discriminate between lattice oxygen and dissolved TMs. Furthermore, it is shown via online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) that O 2 reduction in the here-used LP47 electrolyte consumes ∼2.3 electrons/O 2 . Using this value, the lattice oxygen release deduced from the 3-electrode setup upon charging of the NCA WE is in good agreement with OEMS measurements up to NCA potentials >4.65 V Li . At higher potentials, the contributions from the reduction of TM II+ ions can be quantified by comparing the integrated SE current with the O 2 evolution from OEMS.

Abstract Background COVID-19 remains a major public health concern, with continued resurgences of cases and substantial risk of mortality for hospitalized patients. Remdesivir has become standard-of-care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Given the continued evolution of the disease, clinical management relies on evidence from the current endemic period. Methods Using the PINC AI Healthcare database, effectiveness of remdesivir was evaluated among adults hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 between December 2021 and February 2024. Three cohorts were analysed: adults, elderly (≥65 years), and those with documented COVID-19 pneumonia. Analyses were stratified by oxygen requirements. Patients receiving remdesivir were matched to those not receiving remdesivir using propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine in-hospital mortality. Results 169,965 adults hospitalized for COVID-19 were included, of which 94,129 (55.4%) initiated remdesivir in the first two days of hospitalization. Remdesivir was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate as compared to no remdesivir among patients with no supplemental oxygen charges (NSOc) (aHR [95% CI]: 14-day, 0.75 [0.69-0.82]; 28-day, 0.77 [0.72-0.83]) and among those with supplemental oxygen charges (SOc): 14-day, 0.76 [0.72-0.81]; 28-day, 0.79 [0.74-0.83]) (p&lt;0.0001, for all). Similar findings were observed for elderly patients and those hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions This evidence builds on learnings from randomized controlled trials from the pandemic era to inform clinical practices. Remdesivir was associated with significant reduction in mortality for hospitalized patients including the elderly and those with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Abstract Urea, a highly sought‐after fertilizer, is conventionally manufactured through the energy‐intensive Haber–Bosch process but is frequently encountered as a pollutant in wastewater. Thus, achieving sustainable urea production under ambient conditions and the potential to recycle urea from wastewater represent significant eco‐economic advancements. In this study, a novel Ni‐confined In 2 O 3 (Ni‐In 2 O 3 ) electrocatalyst demonstrating outstanding capabilities in both the urea evolution reaction (UER) from nitrate and carbon dioxide and the highly efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for waste urea utilization is introduced. Computational data and in situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis demonstrate that the unique Ni‐oxygen vacancy (Ni‐Vo) local structure effectively modulates the electronic configuration of neighboring In and Ni atoms. This structural refinement results in a significantly reduced energy barrier for the potential‐determining steps (PDS) in both UER (*COOHNH 2 → *CONH 2 ) and UOR (*CO(NH 2 ) 2 → *CONHNH 2 ). Consequently, the optimized catalysts achieve a urea evolution faradic efficiency of 19.6%, accompanied by remarkable UOR performance, attaining a 100 mA cm −2 anodic current density at a potential of 1.35 V. This work not only offers a sustainable route to urea production but also highlights the potential for efficient urea oxidation, contributing to a greener and more economically viable future for the nitrogen cycle.

Gas bubbles are a necessary byproduct of water electrolysis whereby hydrogen and oxygen are produced from water. These attached gases reduce the electrode's active area, which necessitates a deep understanding of the bubble life cycle starting from nanobubbles. Synchronized with the electrochemistry, the time evolution of the surface nanobubble size and coverage is resolved using grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and correlated with optical microscopy and theoretical calculations to show that a significant portion of the surface is covered in nanobubbles after larger micron-sized bubbles are observed. These nanobubbles increase in number and decrease in size, toward 2 nm diameter, with the charge passed. The trend in size and number is consistent with an increase in supersaturation, which reduces the nascent bubble size. Altogether, this study suggests a significant portion of the surface contains nanobubbles and that strategies to reduce the dissolved hydrogen would be effective at reducing the nanobubble surface coverage.

Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

Key message Plant‐virus‐host interaction is a complex process involving several players. A constant arms race between the hosts and viruses has led to their co‐evolution. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling molecules that regulate plant growth, development, and stress responses. Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) has a wide host range and infects several plant species such as barley, rice, oats, wheat, etc. A recent study by Tian et al. (2024) has highlighted that the movement protein (MP) of BYDV is involved in manipulation of the host ROS pathway to promote viral multiplication as well as transmission. The findings display the multifaceted role of a viral protein that is otherwise involved in movement. The limited coding ability of viruses is compensated by their proteins having multiple roles in the modulation of several different host molecular pathways. This is one of the key reasons for viruses being successful pathogens despite their limited coding ability.

Stars presently identified in the bulge spheroid are probably very old, and their abundances can be interpreted as due to the fast chemical enrichment of the early Galactic bulge. The abundances of the iron-peak elements are important tracers of nucleosynthesis processes, in particular oxygen burning, silicon burning, the weak $s$-process, and alpha -rich freeze-out. The aim of this work is to derive the abundances of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in 58 bulge spheroid stars and to compare them with the results of a previous analysis of data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We selected the best lines for V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu located within the H -band of the spectrum, identifying the most suitable ones for abundance determination, and discarding severe blends. Using the stellar physical parameters available for our sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project, we derived the individual abundances through spectrum synthesis. We then complemented these measurements with similar results from different bulge field and globular cluster stars, in order to define the trends of the individual elements and compare with the results of chemical-evolution models. We verify that the H -band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in moderately metal-poor stars. The abundances, plotted together with others from high-resolution spectroscopy of bulge stars, indicate that: V, Cr, and Ni vary in lockstep with Fe; Co tends to vary in lockstep with Fe, but could be showing a slight decrease with decreasing metallicity; and Mn and Cu decrease with decreasing metallicity. These behaviours are well reproduced by chemical-evolution models that adopt literature yields, except for Cu, which appears to drop faster than the models predict for Fe/H $<$$-$0.8. Finally, abundance indicators combined with kinematical and dynamical criteria appear to show that our 58 sample stars are likely to have originated in situ.

The universe began 13.8 billion years ago, and Earth was born 4.6 billion years ago. Early traces of life were found as soon as 4.1 billion years ago; then, ~200,000 years ago, the human being was born. The evolution of life on earth was to become individual rather than cellular life. The birth of mitochondria made this possible to be the individual life. Since then, individuals have had a limited time of life. It was 1.4 billion years ago that a bacterial cell began living inside an archaeal host cell, a form of endosymbiosis that is the development of eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments. The bacterium started to provide its host cell with additional energy, and the interaction eventually resulted in a eukaryotic cell, with both archaeal (the host cell) and bacterial (mitochondrial) origins still having genomes. The cells survived high concentrations of oxygen producing more energy inside the cell. Further, the roles of mitochondria in human being’s life and aging will be discussed.

Abstract Meteorites and their components exhibit a diverse range of oxygen isotope compositions, and the isotopic exchange timescale between dust grains and ambient gas is a key parameter for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the solar nebula. As dust grains existed as macroscopic aggregates in the solar nebula, it is necessary to consider the isotopic exchange timescales for these aggregates. Here, we theoretically estimate the isotope exchange timescales between dust aggregates and ambient vapor. The isotope exchange process between aggregates and ambient vapor is divided into four processes: (i) supply of gas molecules to the aggregate surface, (ii) diffusion of molecules within the aggregate, (iii) isotope exchange on the surface of constituent particles, and (iv) isotope diffusion within the particles. We evaluate these timescales and assess which one becomes the rate-determining step. We reveal that the isotope exchange timescale is approximately the same as that of the constituent particles when the aggregate radius is smaller than the critical value, which is a few centimeters when considering the exchange reaction between amorphous forsterite aggregates and water vapor.

Abstract Na‐ion batteries (NIBs) have received considerable attention as promising alternatives to lithium‐ion batteries, particularly for low‐speed electric vehicles and large‐scale energy storage applications. Currently, layered oxide compounds are considered the most important cathode materials for NIBs. However, they suffer from reduced capacity and a shortened lifespan when exposed to water vapor during storage or battery assembly. This article elaborates on the structural and chemical evolution of NaNi 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 (NFM) cathode at the atomic scale in a pure water vapor environment. The Na + /H + exchange induces the formation of a spinel‐like phase via a multi‐site nucleation mechanism. This transition preferentially occurs either at the cathode surface or along planar defects such as twin boundaries and grain boundaries. Additionally, numerous microcracks perpendicular to <003> direction appear inside NFM grains, further exacerbating the structural deterioration. Upon prolonged exposure to water vapor, NFM grains decompose into a mixture of Na 2 O and transition metal oxide nanoparticles (FeO, NiO, and MnO), accompanied by the generation of oxygen gas. This research provides a comprehensive atomic‐scale insight into the water vapor instability mechanism of layered oxide cathodes, offering guidance for the design and manufacture of the next generation of water vapor‐tolerant layered oxide cathodes in NIBs.

Abstract Background Achieving cost-competitiveness remains challenging for industrial biomanufacturing. With whole-cell biocatalysis, inefficiency presents when individual cells vary in their production levels. The problem exacerbates when the basis for such production heterogeneity is heritable. Here, evolution selects for the low- and non-producers, as they have lowered/abolished the cost of bioproduction to fitness. With the scale of population expansion required for industrial bioproduction, the asymmetrical enrichment can be severe enough to compromise the performance, and hence commercial viability of the bioprocess. Clearly, addressing production heterogeneity is crucial, especially in improving the stability of bioproduction across the cell generations. In this respect, we designed a growth-coupling strategy for terpenoid bioproduction in Escherichia coli . By knocking out the native 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase ( dxr ) gene and introducing the heterologous mevalonate pathway, we created a chassis that relies solely on the latter for synthesis of all terpenoids. We hypothesise that the need to sustain the biosynthesis of endogenous life-sustaining terpenoids will impose a minimum level of productivity, which concomitantly improves the bioproduction of our target terpenoid. Results Following the confirmation of lethality of a dxr knockout, we challenged the strains with a continuous plasmid-based bioproduction of linalool. The Δ dxr strain achieved an improved productivity profile in the first three days post-inoculation when compared to the parental strain. Productivity of the Δ dxr strain remained observable near the end of 12 days, and after a disruption in nutrient and oxygen supply in a separate run. Unlike the parental strain, the Δ dxr strain did not evolve the same deleterious mutations in the mevalonate pathway, nor a viable subgroup that had lost its resistance to the antibiotic selection pressure (a plausible plasmid loss event). We believe that this divergence in the evolution trajectories is indicative of a successful growth-coupling. Conclusion We have demonstrated a proof of concept of a growth-coupling strategy that improves the performance, and stability of terpenoid bioproduction across cell generations. The strategy is relatively broad in scope, and easy to implement in the background as a ‘fail-safe’ against a fall in productivity below the imposed minimum. We thus believe this work will find widespread utility in our collective effort towards industrial bioproduction.

ABSTRACT After an initial evolution in a reducing environment, life got successively challenged by reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially during the great oxidation event (GOE) that followed the development of photosynthesis. Therefore, ROS are deeply intertwined into the physiological, morphological and transcriptional responses of most present‐day organisms. Copper‐zinc superoxide dismutases (CuZnSODs) evolved during the GOE and are present in charophytes and extant land plants, but nearly absent from chlorophytes. The chemical inhibitor of CuZnSOD, lung cancer screen 1 (LCS‐1), could greatly facilitate the study of SODs in diverse plants. Here, we determined the impact of chemical inhibition of plant CuZnSOD activity, on plant growth, transcription and metabolism. We followed a comparative approach by using different plant species, including Marchantia Polymorpha and Physcomitrium patens, representing bryophytes, the sister lineage to vascular plants, and Arabidopsis thaliana . We show that LCS‐1 causes oxidative stress in plants and that the inhibition of CuZnSODs provoked a similar core response that mainly impacted glutathione homoeostasis in all plant species analysed. That said, Physcomitrium and Arabidopsis, which contain multiple CuZnSOD isoforms showed a more complex and exacerbated response. In addition, an untargeted metabolomics approach revealed a specific metabolic signature for each plant species. Our comparative analysis exposes a conserved core response at the physiological and transcriptional level towards LCS‐1, while the metabolic response largely varies. These differences correlate with the number and localization of the CuZnSOD isoforms present in each species.

Abstract We derive the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in the Narrow Line Regions (NLRs) of a sample of 38 local (z &lt; 0.4) Seyfert 2 nuclei. For that, we consider narrow optical emission line intensities and direct estimates of the electron temperatures (Te-method). We obtain a new theoretical expression for the nitrogen Ionization Correction Factor [ICF($\rm N^{+}$)] for NLRs. Applying this new ICF, we unexpectedly find that NLRs and disk H ii regions exhibit similar ICF distributions. We find nitrogen abundances in the range $7.6 \: &lt; \: \rm 12+log(N/H) \: &lt; \: 8.6$ (mean value 8.06 ± 0.22) or $\rm 0.4 \: &lt; \: (N/N_{\odot }) \: &lt; 4.7$, in the metallicity regime $8.3 \: &lt; \: \rm 12+log(O/H) \: &lt; \: 9.0$. Our results indicate that the dispersion in N/H abundance for a fixed O/H value in AGNs of ∼0.2 dex agrees with that for disc H ii regions with similar metallicity. We show that Seyfert 2 nuclei follow a similar (N/O)-(O/H) relation to the one followed by star-forming objects. Finally, we find that active galaxies called as ”nitrogen-loud” observed at very high redshift (z &gt; 5) show N/O values in consonance with those derived for local NLRs. This result indicates that the main star-formation event is completed in the early evolution stages of active galaxies.

In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$, where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a local superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We present how this scenario can fit most of the available data and propose additional experimental tests which can distinguish our proposal from the Meissner flux exclusion scenario. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. More broadly, this work provides a new mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales.

Abstract. Effective observation of the ocean is vital for studying and assessing the state and evolution of the marine ecosystem and for evaluating the impact of human activities. However, obtaining comprehensive oceanic measurements across temporal and spatial scales and for different biogeochemical variables remains challenging. Autonomous oceanographic instruments, such as Biogeochemical (BGC)-Argo profiling floats, have helped expand our ability to obtain subsurface and deep-ocean measurements, but measuring biogeochemical variables, such as nutrient concentration, still remains more demanding and expensive than measuring physical variables. Therefore, developing methods to estimate marine biogeochemical variables from high-frequency measurements is very much needed. Current neural network (NN) models developed for this task are based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, trained over point-wise pairs of input–output features. Although MLPs can produce smooth outputs if the inputs change smoothly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently designed to handle profile data effectively. In this study, we present a novel one-dimensional (1D) CNN model to predict profiles leveraging the typical shape of vertical profiles of a variable as a prior constraint during training. In particular, the Predict Profiles Convolutional (PPCon) model predicts nitrate, chlorophyll, and backscattering (bbp700) starting from the date and geolocation and from temperature, salinity, and oxygen profiles. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using a robust BGC-Argo dataset collected in the Mediterranean Sea for training and validation. Results, which include quantitative metrics and visual representations, prove the capability of PPCon to produce smooth and accurate profile predictions improving upon previous MLP applications.

Computationally derived volcano curve has become the gold standard in catalysis, whose practical application usually relies on empirical interpretations of composition or size effects by the identical active site assumption. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study on disclosing both the support- and adsorbate-induced restructuring of Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts, and the related interplays among different interfacial sites to propose the synergy-dependent volcano curves. Multiple characterizations, isotopic kinetic investigations, and multiscale simulations unravel that the progressive incorporation of Co into Pt catalysts, driven by strong Pt-C bonding (metal-support interfaces) and Co-O bonding (metal-adsorbate interfaces), initiates the formation of Pt-rich alloys accompanied by isolated Co species, then Co segregation to epitaxial CoOx overlayers and adjacent Co3O4 clusters, and ultimately structural collapse into amorphous alloys. Accordingly, three distinct synergies, involving lattice oxygen redox from Pt-Co alloy/Co3O4 clusters, dual-active sites engineering via Pt-rich alloy/CoOx overlayer, and electron coupling within exposed alloy, are identified and quantified for CO oxidation (gas-phase), ammonia borane hydrolysis (liquid-phase), and hydrogen evolution reaction (electrocatalysis), respectively. The resultant synergy-dependent volcano curves represent an advancement over traditional composition-/size-dependent ones, serving as a bridge between theoretical models and experimental observations in bimetallic catalysis. Volcano curves have become the gold standard in catalyst design. Here, the authors propose synergy-dependent volcano curves by disclosing both support- and adsorbate-induced catalyst restructuring, ideally bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental observations.

Abstract Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a tool for mapping tissue susceptibility. Using QSM for functional brain mapping, it is possible to directly quantify blood‐oxygen‐level‐dependent (BOLD) susceptibility changes. This study presents a submillimeter functional QSM (fQSM) approach compared to BOLD fMRI from data acquired with 3D gradient‐echo echo planar imaging (EPI) at ultra‐high field. Complex EPI data were acquired in nine healthy subjects with varying temporal and spatial resolutions and used for BOLD fMRI and for fQSM. Right‐hand finger tapping experiments were performed as well as one measurement with intentional subject movement. Susceptibility maps were computed using 3D path‐based unwrapping, the variable‐kernel sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data, and the streaking artifact reduction for QSM algorithm. Functional data analysis included general linear modeling and computation of z ‐scores. Submillimeter data were denoised using NOise reduction with DIstribution Corrected (NORDIC), which improved z ‐scores in the motor cortex for fQSM and fMRI. An expected increase in BOLD fMRI signal and corresponding decrease in magnetic susceptibility was observed in sensorimotor areas during active periods. For all experiments, fQSM showed smaller activation regions compared with fMRI. The percentage of high negative t ‐values localized in the cortex was higher for fQSM (52%) than for positive or negative t ‐values for fMRI (45%). For the scans with intentional motion, movement exceeded the size of a voxel, but paradigm dependent signal evolution could be recovered using motion correction. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of submillimeter whole‐brain fQSM with voxel volume of 0.53 μL. In comparison to traditional BOLD fMRI, fQSM provided improved localization of brain activation within the cortex, especially in submillimeter 3D EPI sequences.

Abstract Amid climate change, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy sources is crucial. Ammonia, a carbon-free and renewable fuel, shows significant potential as an alternative energy source. By incorporating hydrogen as an additive, its flammability can be enhanced to suit existing spark ignition engines. However, understanding the characteristics of nitrogen pollutant emissions (i.e., NOx, which includes NO and NO2, and N2O) from ammonia-hydrogen combustion is challenging due to contributions from both fuel-borne and air-borne nitrogen. However, understanding the characteristics of nitrogen pollutant emissions from ammonia-hydrogen combustion is challenging due to contributions from both fuel-borne and air-borne nitrogen. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of fuel-borne nitrogen pollutants during ammonia-hydrogen combustion is essential. This study focuses on investigating fuel-borne nitrogen pollutants in an argon-oxygen atmosphere, thereby eliminating nitrogen from the oxidizer and its role in thermal NOx formation. The research examines the formation and evolution of fuel-borne nitrogen pollutants during ammonia-hydrogen combustion under engine-like conditions. Results indicate that fuel-borne nitrogen pollutants act as intermediates, potentially originating from chemical equilibrium. While fuel NO predominantly forms in the burning zone, it undergoes reduction in the burned zone. N2O, absent in thermal NOx mechanisms, shows significant concentrations in the burning zone and is mostly converted to N2, leading to limited N2O in the final fuel-borne nitrogen pollutant concentration. Lean burn conditions, hydrogen addition, and oxyfuel combustion promote fuel NOx formation. Additionally, the equivalence ratio affects the ammonia-hydrogen premixed flame structure due to the de-NOx effect of ammonia. Overall, these findings highlight that fuel-borne nitrogen pollutant mechanisms differ from thermal NOx mechanisms, necessitating specially designed reduction technologies for clean spark ignition engines.

As a potential model organism for studies of environmental and cell biology, Paramecium duboscqui is a special euryhaline species of Paramecium that can be found in fresh, brackish, or marine water in natural salinity ranges between 0‰ and 33‰. However, the genome information as well as molecular mechanisms that account for its remarkable halotolerant traits remain extremely unknown. To characterize its genome feature, we combined PacBio and Illumina sequencing to assemble the first high-quality and near-complete macronuclear genome of P. duboscqui. Meanwhile, comparative transcriptomic profiles under different salinities gave underlying insight into the molecular mechanism of its adaptations to environmental salinity. The results showed that the MAC genome of P. duboscqui comprises 160 contigs, with 113 of them possessing telomere (~ 28.82 Mb haploid genome size). Through comparative genomic analyses with the other ciliate, we found that gene families encoding transmembrane transporter proteins have been expanded in P. duboscqui, showing enormous potential in salinity adaptation. Like other Paramecium, P. duboscqui utilizes TGA as its only termination codon and has reassigned TAA and TAG to encode glutamine. P. duboscqui showed different growth rates under different salinities, with an optimum growth rate in 5‰ salinity. A comparison of the transcriptomic profiles among P. duboscqui grown under different concentrations showed that genes involved in protein folding, oxygen respiration, and glutathione-dependent detoxification were upregulated in the high-salt group, whereas genes encoding DNA-binding proteins and transcription factors were upregulated in the low-salt group, suggesting distinct mechanisms for responding to low and high salinity. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) linked the hub genes expressed at 30‰ salinity to cysteine-type peptidase activity, lipid transfer, sodium hydrogen exchange, and cell division, with the hub genes expressed at 0‰ salinity involved in transmembrane transport and protein localization. This study characterizes a new euryhaline model Paramecium, provides novel insights into Paramecium evolution, and describes the molecular mechanisms that have allow P. duboscqui to adapt to different osmotic environments.

Abstract Tissue engineering is a pivotal research domain, central to advancing biomedical manufacturing processes with the aim of fabricating functional artificial organs and tissues. Addressing the pressing concern of organ shortages and myriad medical challenges necessitates innovative manufacturing techniques. Hydrogel scaffolds, due to their biocompatibility and extracellular matrix-mimicking porous structure, have emerged as prime candidates in this arena. Moreover, their hygroscopic properties and tunable mechanical characteristics render them suitable for various tissue engineering applications. Despite their promising attributes, a significant manufacturing challenge persists: the optimization of cellular growth within the confines of hydrogel scaffolds. Effective vascularization, essential for optimal cellular nutrient and oxygen supply, remains elusive. Our previous manufacturing research tackled this, introducing a novel hybrid Bio-Fabrication technique. This technique integrated coaxial electrospinning and extrusion-based bioprinting methodologies, yielding hydrogel scaffolds fortified with microtubes. These strategically embedded microtubes, modeled after capillary structures, function as microchannel diffusion conduits, enhancing cellular viability within the hydrogel matrix. A core aspect of scaffold manufacturing is ensuring the stability of its 3D architecture, especially post-swelling. Preliminary hypotheses suggest a gamut of factors — including microtube shape, size, orientation, alignment, and density — play determinant roles in shaping the scaffold’s mechanical attributes. This research rigorously examines the mechanical evolution of hydrogel scaffolds when supplemented with aligned electrospun microtubes across a spectrum of densities. A blend of sodium alginate (SA) and gelatin was selected for the hydrogel matrix due to their inherent biocompatibility and favorable mechanical properties. Different concentrations were prepared to assess the optimal mixture for mechanical stability. A co-axial electrospinning setup was employed where polycaprolactone (PCL) was used as the sheath material and polyethylene oxide (PEO) functioned as the core. This dual material approach was intended to leverage the structural rigidity of PCL with the biodegradability of PEO. The spinning parameters, including voltage, flow rate, and tip-to-collector distance, were meticulously adjusted to produce aligned microtubes of varied densities and diameters. Once the microtubes were synthesized, they were layered within the hydrogel constructs. The layering process involved depositing a hydrogel layer, positioning the microtubes, and then sealing with another hydrogel layer. The entire structure was then solidified using calcium chloride, resulting in a robust, multi-layered composite. Post-fabrication, the hydrogel scaffolds underwent mechanical evaluations. Compression tests were employed to measure the compressive modulus. Tensile tests were conducted to determine ultimate tensile strength. These tests were crucial to understanding the impact of microtube density on the overall mechanical properties of the hydrogel scaffolds. The high-density group, while showing improved mechanical properties over the control group, did not surpass the low-density group, suggesting a possible saturation point. In conclusion, our research methodically explored the influence of microtube density on the mechanical and structural attributes of hydrogel scaffolds. The manufacturing insights gleaned hold substantive implications, promising to propel the field of tissue engineering and drive transformative advancements in biomedical manufacturing.
