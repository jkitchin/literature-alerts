Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is a fundamental process, with gold standards like RuO2 and IrO2. Recently, it was suggested that OER could go through unconventional intermediates, ‐O‐H, ‐OO‐H. ‐O‐H is formed by the direct interaction of an adsorbed O species to a metal surface atom and a proton bound to a surface oxygen. Similarly, in ‐OO‐H, an adsorbed ‐OO adduct interacts with a proton bound to a surface oxygen. This work compares the nature of key intermediates of OER on TiO2, RuO2, and IrO2(110) surfaces by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and Ab‐Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). We rationalized the nature, the relative stability trends in vacuum, the effect of water solvation of the species. ‐OO‐H is preferred than ‐OOH. ‐OH is preferred than ‐O‐H except for RuO2. We investigated the nature of the catalyst/water interfaces and the interaction of intermediates with water based on AIMD. On RuO2, ‐OH and ‐O‐H display a different interaction with water. ‐OO‐H is quite rigid on RuO2, while it is dynamic on IrO2 as the proton is shared between ‐OO and a surface oxygen atom. This study provides insights on the role of solvation to the nature of OER intermediates, that may help future studies.

## Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation

The development of active, stable, and more affordable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for the practical application of electrolyzers and the advancement of renewable energy conversion technologies. Currently, IrO2 is the only catalyst with high stability and activity, but a high cost. Further optimization of the catalyst is limited by the lack of understanding of catalytic behaviors at the acid-IrO2 interface. Here, in strong interaction with the experiment, we develop an explicit model based on grand-canonical density function theory (GC-DFT) calculations to describe acidic OER over IrO2. Compared to the explicit models reported previously, hydronium cations (H3O+) are introduced at the electrochemical interface in the current model. As a result, a variation in stable IrO2 surface configuration under the OER operating condition from previously proposed complete *O-coverage to a mixture coverage of *OH and *O is revealed, which is well supported by in situ Raman measurements. In addition, the accuracy of predicted overpotential is increased in comparison with the experimentally measured. More importantly, an alteration of the potential limiting step from previously identified *O → *OOH to *OH → *O is observed, which opens new opportunities to advance the IrO2-based catalysts for acidic OER.

Abstract The red algae Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis is extensively cultivated at high densities, leading to significant increases in regional seawater pH due to its photosynthetic removal of inorganic carbon. We conducted a study on G. lemaneiformis cultured under various pH conditions (normal pH, pH 9.3, and pH 9.6) and light levels (dark and 100 μmol photons m −2 s −1 ) to investigate how high pH seawater environments affect the metabolic processes of G. lemaneiformis . The high pH did not directly damage the photosynthetic light reactions or the Calvin cycle. Instead, the observed reduction in photosynthetic rates was primarily due to CO 2 limitation. However, under illuminated conditions, a high pH environment leads to a decrease in electron transport efficiency (ETo/RC) and reaction center density (RC/CSo), while simultaneously increasing the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Under illuminated conditions, the limitation of inhibit the photosynthetic electron transport process, leading to energy imbalance and excessive production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn resulted in lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane. This might be one of the inducing factors responsible for the bleaching in sea‐farmed G. lemaneiformis plants.

A novel Ir‐Mn dual‐atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion‐exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self‐limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir‐Mn dual‐atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir‐Mn dual‐atom (2.41 Å) than the Mn‐Mn dual‐atom (2.49 Å). The modulated Ir‐Mn dual‐atom enables the same spin direction O (↑) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2 via the oxygen‐oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir‐SrMnO3 exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100 A gIr‐1 at 1.5 V. The proton‐exchange‐membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir‐SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63 V at 1.0 A cm‐2 and a stable 2000‐h operation with a decay of only 15 μV h‐1 at 0.5 A cm‐2.

The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) supplies the protons and electrons needed to transform renewable electricity into chemicals and fuels. However, the OER is kinetically sluggish; it operates at significant rates only when the applied potential far exceeds the reversible voltage. The origin of this overpotential is hidden in a complex mechanism involving multiple electron transfers and chemical bond making/breaking steps. Our desire to improve catalytic performance has then made mechanistic studies of the OER an area of major scientific inquiry, though the complexity of the reaction has made understanding difficult. While historically, mechanistic studies have relied solely on experiment and phenomenological models, over the past twenty years

By utilizing Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials as a base, constructing electrocatalysts with heterogeneous structures offers advantages for catalyzing water splitting. In this study, a hollow heterogeneous nanocatalyst, Ir-MIL-88A@NiFe-LDHs, was prepared by growing a layered double hydroxides (LDHs) shell on MIL-88A substrate. The catalyst shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in a 1.0 M KOH solution, requiring only 217 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm

Prochlorococcus marinus , the smallest picocyanobacterium, comprises multiple clades occupying distinct niches, currently across tropical and sub-tropical oligotrophic ocean regions, including Oxygen Minimum Zones. Ocean warming may open growth-permissive temperatures in new, poleward photic regimes, along with expanded Oxygen Minimum Zones. We used ocean metaproteomic data on current Prochlorococcus marinus niches, to guide testing of Prochlorococcus marinus growth across a matrix of peak irradiances, photoperiods, spectral bands and dissolved oxygen. MED4 from Clade HLI requires greater than 4 h photoperiod, grows at 25 μmol O 2 L -1 and above, and exploits high cumulative diel photon doses. MED4, however, relies upon an alternative oxidase to balance electron transport, which may exclude it from growth under our lowest, 2.5 μmol O 2 L -1 , condition. SS120 from clade LLII/III is restricted to low light under full 250 μmol O 2 L -1 , shows expanded light exploitation under 25 μmol O 2 L -1 , but is excluded from growth under 2.5 μmol O 2 L -1 . Intermediate oxygen suppresses the cost of PSII photoinactivation, and possibly the enzymatic production of H 2 O 2 in SS120, which has limitations on genomic capacity for PSII and DNA repair. MIT9313 from Clade LLIV is restricted to low blue irradiance under 250 μmol O 2 L -1 , but exploits much higher irradiance under red light, or under lower O 2 concentrations, conditions which slow photoinactivation of PSII and production of reactive oxygen species. In warming oceans, range expansions and competition among clades will be governed not only by light levels. Short photoperiods governed by latitude, temperate winters, and depth attenuation of light, will exclude clade HLI (including MED4) from some habitats. In contrast, clade LLII/III (including SS120), and particularly clade LLIV (including MIT9313), may exploit higher light niches nearer the surface, under expanding OMZ conditions, where low O 2 relieves the stresses of oxidation stress and PSII photoinhibition.

Trifunctional electrocatalysts, an exciting class of materials that can simultaneously catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), can significantly enhance the performance and economic viability of electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies such as water‐splitting electrolyzers, metal‐air batteries, fuel cells and their integrated devices. Such multifunctional electrocatalysts encompass multiple active sites that can simultaneously catalyze two or more different electrochemical reactions and are feasible routes for addressing global energy and environmental challenges. This review accounts for nanocarbons‐based trifunctional electrocatalysts reported for electrolyzers, metal‐air batteries and integrated electrolyzer‐battery systems, providing a practical perspective. Metal‐free and hybrid (hybrids of nanocarbons and transition metals/compounds) trifunctional electrocatalysts are covered. Given the growing importance of green technologies, we discuss biomass‐derived carbon‐based trifunctional electrocatalysts separately. The collective information provided in the review could help researchers derive more effective and durable trifunctional electrocatalysts suitable for commercial use.

Abstract Photosystem II (PSII) uses light energy to oxidize water and to reduce plastoquinone in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. O 2 is produced as a byproduct. While most members of the PSII research community agree that O 2 originates from water molecules, alternative hypotheses involving bicarbonate persist in the literature. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the important roles of bicarbonate in regulating PSII activity and assembly. Further, we emphasize that biochemistry, spectroscopy, and structural biology experiments have all failed to detect bicarbonate near the active site of O 2 evolution. While thermodynamic arguments for oxygen-centered bicarbonate oxidation are valid, the claim that bicarbonate is a substrate for photosynthetic O 2 evolution is challenged.

Abstract Stable, efficient, and economical bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are needed for rechargeable Zn–air batteries. In this study, a directional electron transfer pathway is exploited in a spatial heterojunction of Co y Ni x @Fe─N─C heterogeneous catalyst for effective bifunctional electrolysis (OER/ORR). Thereinto, the Co/Ni alloy is strongly coupled to the Fe─N─C support through Co/Ni─N bonds. DFT calculations and experimental findings confirm that Co/Ni─N bonds play a bridging role in the directional electron transfer from Co/Ni alloy to the Fe─N─C support, increasing the content of pyridinic nitrogen in the ORR‐active support. In addition, the discovered directional electron transfer mechanism enhances both the ORR/OER activity and the durability of the catalyst. The Co 0.66 Ni 0.34 @Fe─N─C with the optimal Ni/Co ratio exhibits satisfying bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, requiring an ORR half‐wave potential of 0.90 V and an OER overpotential of 317 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline electrolytes. The assembled rechargeable zinc–air batteries (ZABs) incorporating Co 0.66 Ni 0.34 @Fe─N─C cathode exhibits a charge–discharge voltage gap comparable to the Pt/C||IrO 2 assembly and high robustness for over 60 h at 20 mA cm −2 .

Abstract Acidic water electrolysis is of considerable interest due to its higher current density operation and energy conversion efficiency, but its real industrial application is highly limited by the shortage of efficient, stable, and cost‐effective acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Here, an electrocatalyst consisting of Ni‐implanted RuO 2 supported is reported on α‐MnO 2 (MnO 2 /RuO 2 ‐Ni) that shows high activity and remarkable durability in acidic OER. Precisely, the MnO 2 /RuO 2 ‐Ni catalyst shows an overpotential of 198 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 and can operate continuously and stably for 400 h (j = 10 mA cm −2 ) without any obvious attenuation of activity, making it one of the best‐performing acid‐stable OER catalysts. Experimental results, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, demonstrate that the interface electron transfer effect from RuO 2 to MnO 2 , further enhanced by Ni incorporation, effectively modulates the adsorption of OOH * and significantly reduces the overpotential, thereby enhancing catalytic activity and durability.

Abstract MXene, regarded as cutting‐edge two‐dimensional (2D) materials, have been widely explored in various applications due to their remarkable flexibility, high specific surface area, good mechanical strength, and interesting electrical conductivity. Recently, 2D MXene has served as a ideal platform for the design and development of electrocatalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability. This review article provides a detailed description of the structural engineering of MXene‐based electrocatalysts and summarizes the uses of 2D MXene in hydrogen evolution reactions, nitrogen reduction reactions, oxygen evolution reactions, oxygen reduction reactions, and methanol/ethanol oxidation. Then, key issues and prospects for 2D MXene as a next‐generation platform in fundamental research and real‐world electrocatalysis applications are discussed. Emphasis will be given to material design and enhancement techniques. Finally, future research directions are suggested to improve the efficiency of MXene‐based electrocatalysts.

Compositional complex alloys, including high and medium-entropy alloys (HEAs/MEAs) have displayed significant potential as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but their structure-activity relationship remains unclear. In particular, the basic question of which crystal facets are more active, especially considering the surface reconstructions, has yet to be answered. This study demonstrates that the lowest index {100} facets of FeCoNiCr MEAs exhibit the highest activity. The underlying mechanism associated with the {100} facet's low in-plane density, making it easier to surface reconstruction and form amorphous structures containing the true active species is uncovered. These results are validated by experiments on single crystals and polycrystal MEAs, as well as DFT calculations. The discoveries contribute to a fundamental comprehension of MEAs in electrocatalysis and offer physics-based strategies for developing electrocatalysts.

In the current highly industrialized living environment, air quality has become an increasing public health concern. Natural environments like forests have excellent air quality due to high concentrations of negative oxygen ions originating from low-voltage ionization, without harmful ozone. Traditional negative oxygen ion generators require high voltage for corona discharge to produce ions. However, high voltage can increase electron collisions and excitations, leading to more dissociation and recombination of oxygen molecules and consequently higher ozone production. To address the challenge of generating negative oxygen ions without accompanying ozone production, this study designed and constructed a low-voltage negative oxygen ion generator based on nanometer-tip carbon fiber electrodes. The advantage of this device lies in the high curvature radius of carbon fibers, which provides high local electric field strength. This allows for efficient production of negative oxygen ions at low operating voltages without generating ozone. Experiments demonstrated that the device can efficiently generate negative oxygen ions at a working voltage as low as 2.16 kV, 28% lower than the lowest voltage reported in similar studies. The purification device manufactured in this study had a total decay constant for PM2.5 purification of 0.8967 min−1 within five minutes, compared to a natural decay constant of only 0.0438 min−1, resulting in a calculated Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) of 0.1535 m3/min. Within half an hour, concentrations of PM2.5, PM1, PM10, formaldehyde, and TVOC were reduced by 99.09%, 99.40%, 99.37%, 94.39%, and 99.35%, respectively, demonstrating good decay constants and CADR. These findings confirm its effectiveness in improving indoor air quality, highlighting its significant application value in air purification.

Abstract Poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) film was applied as a photoanode on an electron‐extracting layer‐coated upon a current‐collecting plastic substrate. The film soaked in an aqueous solution (pH 12) exhibited an enhanced anodic current with light illumination, and the photocurrent density ( J ) reached almost 100 μA/cm 2 for its wound cylinder, which was accompanied by oxygen bubble evolution. The light ON/OFF response, light‐intensity proportion, and wavelength‐dependency of the J value supported the photo‐electrolytic function of the P3HT film. The hole‐injection efficiency of the film estimated for water oxidation using a solution involving a sacrificial reagent, was relatively high in the range of 46%–86%. Although an apparent activation energy of 39 kJ/mol for the electrolytic water oxidation in the dark suggested a chemical but catalytic pathway for the film anode, the temperature independence of the photocurrent indicated direct hole‐injection into water or hydroxide ions. The photoanode performance of the P3HT film for water oxidation was discussed in relation to the energy diagram including the highest occupied molecular orbital level.

Ru‐based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7–d) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7–d over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7–d due to its inner ²perfecting² lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir‐substituted Y2Ru2O7–d is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double‐exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg'2­­a1g­1 eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg'4a1g­2 eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn‐Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir‐substituted Y2Ru2O7–d presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru‐based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.

Balancing the relationship between electrocatalytic activity and stability of sulfide catalysts during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been attracting extensive research interest. Here, a simple electrodeposition‐vulcanization two‐step route was designed to successfully construct nickel foam supported sheet‐like Fe,Ce‐codoped Ni3S2/NiS polymorphism catalyst (labeled as Fe,Ce‐Ni3S2/NiS/NF). Electrochemical measurements showed that the as‐obtained Fe,Ce‐Ni3S2/NiS/NF electrode presented excellent OER electrocatalytic performances. In 1 M KOH solution, merely 173 and 234 mV of overpotentials were required to deliver the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm‐2, respectively. Further investigations revealed that the Fe,Ce co‐doping regulated the electron density around Ni, which promoted the conversion of Ni towards the higher valence state and simultaneously, avoided the stability decrease of the catalyst caused by excessive oxidation corrosion. Moreover, the defects generated during vulcanization also contributed to promoting water oxidation. The present work provides a facile and feasible approach to balance the relationship between the stability and the activity of sulfide catalysts for OER.

Abstract Effectively suppressing nonradiative recombination at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface is imperative for perovskite solar cells. Although the capabilities of alkali salts at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface have been acknowledged, the effects and optimal selection of alkali metal cations remain poorly understood. Herein, a novel approach for obtaining the optimal alkali metal cation (A‐cation) at the interface is investigated by comparatively analyzing different alkali carbonates (A 2 CO 3 ; Li 2 CO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 , K 2 CO 3 , Rb 2 CO 3 , and Cs 2 CO 3 ). Theoretical calculations demonstrate that A 2 CO 3 coordinates with undercoordinated Sn and O on the surface, effectively mitigating oxygen vacancy (V O ) defects with increasing A‐cation size, whereas Cs 2 CO 3 exhibits diminished preferability owing to enhanced steric hindrance. The experimental results highlight the crucial role of Rb 2 CO 3 in actively passivating V O defects, forming a robust bond with SnO 2 , and facilitating Rb + diffusion into the perovskite layer, thereby enhancing charge extraction, alleviating deep‐level trap states and structural distortion in the perovskite film, and significantly suppressing nonradiative recombination. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy analyses further reveal the effect of Rb 2 CO 3 on the local structure of the perovskite film. Consequently, a Rb 2 CO 3 ‐treated device with aperture area of 0.14 cm 2 achieves a notable efficiency of 22.10%, showing improved stability compared to the 20.11% achieved for the control device.

Understanding the origin of surface reconstruction is crucial for developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides. Traditionally, the reconstruction has been achieved through electrochemical procedures, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In this work, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM‐based CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 catalyst was an irreversible oxygen redox chemical reaction. And a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (EO‐V) could benefit the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Motivated by this finding, a strategy of phase boundary construction from Co tetrahedral to octahedral was employed to decrease EO‐V in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results showed that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rose to 64%, a 3.5 nm‐thick reconstructed layer formed on the catalyst surface with a 158 mV decrease in overpotential. Further experiments indicated that the coexistence of tetrahedral‐octahedral (O‐T) phase would result in lattice mismatch, promoting non‐bonding oxygen states and lowering EO‐V. Then more active lattice oxygen combined with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH‐), followed by soluble cation leaching, which enhanced the reconstruction process. This work provided new insights into the relationship between the intrinsic structure of pre‐catalysts and surface reconstruction in LOM‐based spinel electrocatalysts.

Abstract The nickel‐iron based materials are widely studied as excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, its relatively poor OER stability limits its practical applications. Herein, a zipper‐like interlocked heterostructure of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)‐WN is constructed. The NiFe LDH‐WN exhibits not only ultrahigh OER activity of 228 mV overpotential at a current density of 50 mA cm −2 , but also extremely long‐term stability over 4500 h at 50 mA cm −2 and over 550 h at an industrial current density ≈350 mA cm −2 , which is ascribed to its special zipper‐like interlocked structure. Moreover, in situ Raman confirms that the presence of WN can efficiently achieve NiFe LDH reconstruction to slower the metal dissolution during OER, and therefore boosts its stability. DFT calculations reveal that WN not only can increase the *O adsorption capability and conductivity of NiFe LDH layer, but also can anchor the metal atoms of NiFe LDH layer to improve the dissolution energy barrier. In short, this work presents a new method of constructing the interlocked heterostructure to improve the OER stability of Ni‐Fe‐based catalysts, which would accelerate its practical application.

Cyanobacteriota, the sole prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis (OxyP), occupy a unique and pivotal role in Earth's history. While the notion that OxyP may have originated from Cyanobacteriota is widely accepted, its early evolution remains elusive. Here, by using both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, we explore 36 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from hot spring ecosystems, belonging to two deep-branching cyanobacterial orders: Thermostichales and Gloeomargaritales. Functional investigation reveals that Thermostichales encode the crucial thylakoid membrane biogenesis protein, Vipp1. Based on the phylogenetic results, we infer that the evolution of the thylakoid membrane predates the divergence of Thermostichales from other cyanobacterial groups and that Thermostichales may be the most ancient lineage known to date to have inherited this feature from their common ancestor. Apart from OxyP, both lineages are potentially capable of sulfide-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis (AnoxyP) by linking sulfide oxidation to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Unexpectedly, this AnoxyP capacity appears to be an acquired feature, as the key gene sqr was horizontally transferred from later-evolved cyanobacterial lineages. The presence of two D1 protein variants in Thermostichales suggests the functional flexibility of photosystems, ensuring their survival in fluctuating redox environments. Furthermore, all MAGs feature streamlined phycobilisomes with a preference for capturing longer-wavelength light, implying a unique evolutionary trajectory. Collectively, these results reveal the photosynthetic flexibility in these early-diverging cyanobacterial lineages, shedding new light on the early evolution of Cyanobacteriota and their photosynthetic processes.

As modern society continues to advance, the depletion of non-renewable energy sources (such as natural gas and petroleum) exacerbates environmental and energy issues. The development of green, environmentally friendly energy storage and conversion systems is imperative. The energy density of commercial lithium-ion batteries is approaching its theoretical limit, and even so, it struggles to meet the rapidly growing market demand. Lithium–oxygen batteries have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their exceptionally high theoretical energy density. However, challenges such as poor electrolyte stability, short cycle life, low discharge capacity, and high overpotential arise from the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging. This article elucidates the fundamental principles of lithium–oxygen batteries, analyzes the primary issues currently faced, and summarizes recent research advancements in air cathodes and anodes. Additionally, it proposes future directions and efforts for the development of lithium–air batteries.

Abstract The rational development and synthesis of renewable nanostructured materials hold significant importance within the realm of energy storage applications. In this study, the quaternary chalcogenide of Cu2FeBiS4 was fabricated using a facile solvothermal method and evaluated for its performance in Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Supercapacitor applications. The material underwent characterization employing various analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman analysis. Cu2FeBiS4 demonstrates an improved super-capacitive performance, exhibiting an outstanding specific capacity (Cs) of 1530 F g–1 at 2 A g–1. The admirable electrochemical activity is mainly due to the synergistic effect of mixed metal sulfide nanostructure that can escalate the rapid diffusion of ions and electrons, which is beneficial to the electrode/electrolyte contact area, thereby boosting the rate of charge transfer. Additionally, Cu2FeBiS4 exhibits a commendable energy density of 43.17 Wh kg− 1 at a power density of 327.87 W kg− 1, accompanied by a retention rate of 96.2% after 1000 cycles. As a result, the Cu2FeBiS4 electrode developed in this study is evinced to be a promising electrode material for high-performance energy storage devices. Moreover, Cu2FeBiS4 demonstrates proficient electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction, displaying a minimal overpotential of 202 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm− 2 and exhibiting operational stability for up to 10 hours.

Inducing strain in the lattice effectively enhances the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts by shifting the metal's d-band center and tuning the binding energy of reaction intermediates. NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their cost-effectiveness and high catalytic activity. The distorted β-NiOOH phase produced by the Jahn-Teller effect under the oxidation polarization is known to exhibit superior catalytic activity, but it eventually transforms to the undistorted γ-NiOOH phase during the OER process. Such a reversible lattice distortion limits the OER activity. In this study, we propose a facile boron tungstate (BWO) anion intercalation method to induce irreversible lattice distortion in NiFe LDHs, leading to significantly enhanced OER activity. Strong interactions with BWO anions induce significant stress on the LDH's metal-hydroxide slab, leading to an expansion of metal-oxygen bonds and subsequent lattice distortion.

Abstract It is vital to understand the degradation mechanisms for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic electrolyser operating conditions. To this end, we have studied a commercial benchmark Ir-Oxide electrocatalyst during an accelerated stress test (AST) of potential cycling (2000 cycles at 100 mV/s) between 1.0 and 1.7 V in 0.1 M HClO4. The OER activity degradation (>60%) has been investigated due to (i) bulk structure changes from metal dissolution, (ii) particle growth and, (iii) surface chemical state changes. Microscopic images of the Ir-Oxide catalyst before and after the AST show no significant change in the particle size or agglomeration; moreover, negligible mass loss of the element. Therefore, the OER activity degradation is found to be dominantly (99%) associated with changes of the surface chemical state of Ir, i.e., increase in the Ir4+/Ir3+ ratio at the surface of Ir-Oxide during the AST.

To address energy shortages and environmental issues, prioritizing renewable energy development and usage is crucial. Employing renewable sources for water electrolysis offers a sustainable method for hydrogen generation. Reducing the water electrolysis potential is vital for efficient clean energy conversion and storage. Substituting the anodic oxygen evolution reaction in conventional hydrogen production from water electrolysis with the more thermodynamically favorable 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction can greatly decrease overpotential and yield the valuable product 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid. The key to this process is developing effective electrocatalysts to minimize the potential of the HMF electrooxidation-hydrogen production system. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive introduction to the modulation strategies that affect the electronic and geometric structure of electrocatalysts for HMF oxidation-assisted water splitting. The strategies encompass heteroatom doping, defect projection, interface engineering, structural design, and multi-metal synergies. The catalysts are assessed from various angles, encompassing structural characterization, reaction mechanisms, and electrochemical performance. Finally, current challenges in the catalyst design and potential development of this promising field are proposed.

Abstract Improving the efficiency of bifunctional electrocatalysts is a decisive challenge in the area of long‐lasting rechargeable zinc‐air batteries. Enhancing the catalysts' performance is crucial for advancing zinc‐air batteries. Transition‐metal oxides have emerged as promising non‐precious, noble‐metal‐free catalysts. Herein, a unique precursor directed approach is introduced for preparing a cobalt ferrite@nitrogen doped carbon nanohorns (CoFe 2 O 4 @N‐CNHs) nanohybrid catalyst in a single step annealing process involving stoichiometric amounts of single‐source cobalt and iron molecular precursors and carbon nanohorns (CNHs) under an argon/ammonia (Ar/NH 3 ) atmosphere. This procedure enables a simultaneous CoFe 2 O 4 ferrite synthesis and nitrogen functionalization of CNHs. The precious metal free nanohybrid CoFe 2 O 4 @N‐CNHs‐30% containing 30% of carbon presents an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half wave potential and onset potential comparable to the standard ORR catalyst 20% Pt/C. CoFe 2 O 4 @N‐CNHs‐30% also establishes superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope than benchmark OER catalyst RuO 2 . Furthermore, the rechargeable zinc‐air battery with the CoFe 2 O 4 @N‐CNHs‐30% nanohybrid as air electrode demonstrates steadier and more durable charge–discharge cycles, and outstanding energy density relative to the state‐of‐the‐art 20% Pt/C‐RuO 2 catalyst.

Abstract Developing cost‐effective, high‐performance, and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal for advancing hydrogen energy conversion and storage technologies. Simultaneously, establishing scalable methods for their production is essential for the widespread adoption of these renewable energy solutions. In this study, we present a successful large‐scale synthesis of surfactant‐free iridium‐doped Pt−cobalt nanoparticles supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Ir−Pt 3 Co/MWCNTs). This composite demonstrates significantly enhanced ORR and OER activity compared to commercial Pt/C and IrO 2 in acidic environments. The Ir−Pt 3 Co/MWCNTs catalyst composite exhibits a low overpotential of 357 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a remarkable mass activity of 0.594 A/mg Pt . Investigating the influence of Ir doping content on ORR and OER, we found that Pt 3 Co 0.6 Ir 0.4 /MWCNTs showcased the most superior activity in both reactions. We present a reproducible protocol for the synthesis of surfactant‐free Ir−Pt 3 Co nanoparticles supported on MWCNTs, yielding a bifunctional catalyst capable of efficiently catalyzing both ORR and OER with outstanding efficiency and stability in acidic media. Detailed X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis elucidates the electron transfer between atoms, optimizing the electronic structure and adjusting the position of the d‐band. This optimization enhances the electrocatalytic activity and structural stability of the catalysts, contributing to their superior performance in ORR and OER.

Abstract Recently, Ni‐based chalcogenides havedemonstrated remarkable activity and selectivity for alcohol electrooxidation, but the mechanisms remain debated. This study synthesizes Ni‐based electrodeswith different chalcogen anion coordination on nickel nanorod arrays (NiO x /Ni,NiS x /Ni, and NiSe x /Ni NRAs). NiSe x /Ni NRAsshowcases superior performance (Faradaic efficiency 92.9%) in glycerolelectrooxidation reaction (GOR). In situ spectroscopy reveals that NiSecoordination inhibits deep oxidative reconstruction of the Ni‐based interface, preventingNiOOH phase formation during GOR, enhancing activity and stability of NiSe x /NiNRAs. Conversely, NiS and NiO coordination lead to deep reconstruction with NiOOHphase formation, limiting GOR performance. Differently, during competingreaction of GOR, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) leads to deepreconstruction of NiSex interface due to the instability of Ni‐Sebonds, inducing performance degradation and dissolution of Se components. Furthermechanism investigation elucidates that the rate‐determining step (RDS) ofGOR at the NiSe x interface involves oxidation of *C 2 H 3 O 3 intermediatesthrough H 2 O adsorption, favoring stable formate production.Contrarily, the RDS at the NiS x , NiO x , and NiOOHinterfaces predominantly focus on the decarboxylation of multi‐carbon intermediates, raisingenergy barriers and over‐oxidizing formate to CO 2 . These results providenew insights for designing Ni‐based non‐oxide catalysts forefficient and stable electrocatalytic oxidation.

Abstract Today world is looking for a cheap, environment friendly and efficient substitute of fossil fuel. Because due to large consumption of the fossil fuels on daily basis in whole world, emission of hazardous gases have produced lethal effects on human being. In this scenario hydrogen energy has emerged in form of clean, renewable and more efficient energy. Now the key challenge is that efficient production of the green hydrogen at commercial scale to meet demand of hydrogen. The electrolysis of water is the best pathway to achieve efficient hydrogen production. For this purpose the synthesis and improvement of low cast, active as well as stable catalysts or electrolysis is prerequisite for hydrogen production by electro-catalytic method for splitting of water. Main focus of this review is that, how we can perform the electrolysis of water by various techniques using novel methods especially electro-catalysts in term of activity, efficiency, large surface area, porosity, and stability. This will be performed by the method of two-half cell reaction one is the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) other one Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), where reaction proceeded in both medium acidic as well as alkaline phases. Particular attention is given to produce green clean hydrogen production from usable water and its physical and chemical storages for further uses for the support of human sustainability. Basically the recent strategy is to prepare, design and development of nanoscale materials/composite with non-noble metals and with also nanostructured with noble-metals will be discussed in this approach. The increased efficiency and utility have been the focal points of the use of diverse materials from different classes. To increase the electro-catalytic efficiency in OER and HER, we will discuss about new analyses methods and insights into studying the chemical compositions, shapes, surface area, porosity, and synergy of catalysts and the active sites of nanostructured electro-catalysts. This review will further provide the picture of current state of developments as well as recent progress for mechanized efficient production of clean hydrogen (i.e., HER) from water by electrocatalytic method using various nanoscale materials in a broad scale.

Abstract Data for mass loss of a variety of magnesium alloys as a function of exposure period show that corrosion loss follows bimodal trending with time for different exposure environments, both laboratory and field support these findings. For data sets sufficient to discriminate bimodal behaviour, the instantaneous rate of corrosion at the commencement of the second mode is (close to) 4 times the instantaneous rate of corrosion at the end of the first mode (i.e. through the transition period). This observation is consistent with the theoretical relative diffusivities of oxygen and hydrogen through the corrosion product layer as it exists during the transition period. These findings support the notion that the bimodal model has corrosion in Mode 1 rate-controlled by the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction and the inward diffusion of oxygen while in Mode 2 corrosion is rate-controlled by the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction and the outward diffusion of hydrogen. Similar findings have been made previously for various ferrous and other alloys and thus throws new light on the development of corrosion of magnesium alloys. It also provides reasons for measurements of hydrogen evolution and for electrochemical techniques underestimating magnesium corrosion rates. A new procedure for combining these is proposed.

This study investigates the evolution of the biofilm matrix responsible for treating effluent from a pulp mill and identifies the microbial community by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition, a biocarrier promising a functional structure with better specific features for biofilm formation than traditional polyurethane carriers was explored. The average removal efficiencies were 43.7% for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 62.7% for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). The color increased during the treatment, indicating anoxic zones being formed in the inner part of this type of carrier. Periodic micrographs showed the evolution of extracellular polymeric substances and materials like fungi and bacteria adhered to the carriers. Genetic sequencing confirmed the presence of Bacillus sp. and Paenibacillus glucanolyticus, species with the potential to degrade and discolor pulp industrial effluents. Results offer a potential basis to enhance treatment facilities of pulp and paper mills based on microbial activities.

Temperature and oxygen are two factors that profoundly affect survival limits of animals; too much or too little of either is lethal. However, both humans and animals can exhibit exceptional survival when oxygen and temperature are simultaneously low. To better understand this apparent synergistic interaction between oxygen and temperature, we assayed the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans in experimental environments at different temperatures and oxygen concentrations. While nematodes cannot survive a day in room air at 2 degrees C (cold shock), we found that when oxygen is low, 200-fold less than room air, they can survive this temperature for 48 hours. Consistent with this, we found that worms exposed to high oxygen concentrations, 35 times greater than room air, are more sensitive to low temperature than worms in room air. These results show that normal atmospheric levels of oxygen are toxic in the cold. Using these survival assays, we found that cold acclimatization protects worms from lethal effects of high oxygen, mutations in the cold acclimatization pathway affect oxygen tolerance, and that the naturally occurring and physiologically relevant compounds glucose, manganese (II), and ascorbate improve survival limits in both low temperature and high oxygen when supplied early in life. These results show that the interdependence of temperature and oxygen on survival in C. elegans is based in part on shared physiological mechanisms involved in response to these two environmental stressors. The evolution and natural history of stress responses in animals suggest similar phenomena may function in humans.

Abstract The interplay of lattice, electronic, and spin degrees of freedom at epitaxial complex oxide interfaces provides a route to tune their magnetic ground states. Unraveling the competing contributions is critical for tuning their functional properties. The relationship between magnetic ordering and magnetic anisotropy and the lattice symmetry, oxygen content, and film thickness in compressively strained LaMnO 3 (LMO)/LaCrO 3 (LCO) superlattices is investigated. Mn–O–Cr antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions across the heterointerface result in a net ferrimagnetic magnetic structure. Bulk magnetometry measurements reveal isotropic in‐plane magnetism for as‐grown oxygen‐deficient thin samples due to equal fractions of orthorhombic a+a‐c‐, and a‐a+c‐ twin domains. As the superlattice thickness is increased, in‐plane magnetic anisotropy emerges as the fraction of the a+a‐c‐ domain increases. On annealing in oxygen, the suppression of oxygen vacancies results in a contraction of the lattice volume, and an orthorhombic to rhombohedral transition leads to isotropic magnetism independent of the film thickness. The complex interactions are investigated using high‐resolution synchrotron diffraction and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy. These results highlight the role of the evolution of structural domains with film thickness, interfacial spin interactions, and oxygen‐vacancy‐induced structural phase transitions in tuning the magnetic properties of complex oxide heterostructures.

Light-dark cycles affect photosynthetic efficiency in autotrophic cyanobacteria; therefore, determining whether ancient cyanobacteria possessed a self-sustained circadian clock when oxygenic photosynthetic systems were established is an important issue in chronobiology. Here we examined the oscillation of the clock protein KaiC in modern cyanobacteria, as well as the function and structure of ancestral Kai proteins, to determine the evolutionary origin of the self-sustained Kai-protein oscillators. The results show that the oldest double-domain KaiC in ancestral bacteria lacked the factors functionally and structurally essential for rhythmicity. The ancestral Kai proteins had acquired these factors through molecular evolution that occurred around Global Oxidation and Snowball Earth events, and were eventually inherited as a self-sustained circadian oscillator by the most recent common ancestor of cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis. This autonomous Kai protein oscillator was further inherited by most freshwater and marine cyanobacteria present today as an autotrophic basis for time-optimal acquisition and consumption of energy from oxygenic photosynthesis.

The onset of Darwinian evolution represents a key step in the transition of chemical systems into living ones. Here, we show the emergence of Darwinian evolution in two systems of self-replicating molecules, where natural selection favors replicator mutants best capable of catalyzing the production of the precursors required for their own replication. Such selection for protometabolic activity was observed in a system where trimer and hexamer replicators compete for common resources, as well as in a system of different hexamer replicator mutants. An out-of-equilibrium replication-destruction regime was implemented in a flow reactor, where replication from continuously supplied dithiol building blocks needs to keep up with “destruction” by outflow. Selection occurred based on the ability of the mutants to activate a cofactor that photocatalytically produces singlet oxygen which, in turn, enhances the rate by which dithiol building blocks are converted into disulfide-based replicator precursors. Selection was based on a functional trait (catalytic activity) opening up Darwinian evolution as a tool for catalyst development. This work functionally integrates self-replication with protometabolism and Darwinian evolution and marks a further advance in the de-novo synthesis of life.

Abstract Jeju Volcanic Island is the largest island in South Korea which is known as the continental shelf intraplate volcanic island. MELTS, one of the powerful programs utilizing for modeling magmatic evolution processes, is applied to simulate fractional crystallization process of low-alumina alkaline volcanic rock suite in Jeju Island. At many isobaric pressure conditions from 2.0 GPa to 0.1 GPa as well as different oxygen fugacities (fO2) from FMQ-3 to FMQ + 3 and H2O content, MELTS modeling were conducted as various calculations. The results demonstrate that the most suitable fractionation model for Jeju low-alumina alkaline magma would occur from 0.2 GPa to 0.1 GPa with oxygen fugacity FMQ buffer. These contain 0.5 wt.% H2O in the system leading to more consistent with evolution trending of as well as mineral composition in natural rock suite on Jeju Island. Although MELTS still possesses several limitations in the stability of calibration such as spinel overestimation as well as a lack of experiments for hydrous minerals which have been renovated, MELTS exhibits its affection on temperature and pressure prediction as well as assess other factor of fractional crystallization process on Jeju Island. Consequently, to evaluate a magmatic process in a particular region, it would be better to combine MELTS with other analyses rather than operating independently.

Summary Coral thermal bleaching resilience can be improved by enhancing photosymbiont thermal tolerance via experimental evolution. While successful for some strains, selection under stable temperatures was ineffective at increasing the thermal threshold of an already thermo‐tolerant photosymbiont ( Durusdinium trenchii ). Corals from environments with fluctuating temperatures tend to have comparatively high heat tolerance. Therefore, we investigated whether exposure to temperature oscillations can raise the upper thermal limit of D. trenchii . We exposed a D. trenchii strain to stable and fluctuating temperature profiles, which varied in oscillation frequency. After 2.1 yr (54–73 generations), we characterised the adaptive responses under the various experimental evolution treatments by constructing thermal performance curves of growth from 21 to 31°C for the heat‐evolved and wild‐type lineages. Additionally, the accumulation of extracellular reactive oxygen species, photophysiology, photosynthesis and respiration rates were assessed under increasing temperatures. Of the fluctuating temperature profiles investigated, selection under the most frequent oscillations (diurnal) induced the greatest widening of D. trenchii 's thermal niche. Continuous selection under elevated temperatures induced the only increase in thermal optimum and a degree of generalism. Our findings demonstrate how differing levels of thermal homogeneity during selection drive unique adaptive responses to heat in a coral photosymbiont.

Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e− ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex‐situ and in‐situ characterizations, including X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo‐induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration‐corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical‐driven methods. The electrochemical‐driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen‐deficient [NiO6]‐[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e− ORR capability than that of chemical‐driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of >90% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4 V) with a peak selectivity of >99%. Notably, within the flow cell, a current density exceeding 200 mA cm−2 was sustained for over 20 h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of approximately 90% and a hydrogen peroxide production rate surpassing 4 mol g−1 h−1.

Field observations and laboratory data collected from the Taurus Mountains Range, Turkey during the last two decades provided evidence for the link between the evolution of hypogene karst and the geodynamic history. Major evidence includes; carbonate-hosted secondary ore deposits that are converted from primarily hypogene minerals by epigene, oxygen-rich groundwater circulating at local to intermediate depths. Another piece of evidence of hypogene karst in the Tauride is the Kırkgöz springs’ huge submerged cave/conduit system, which formed the Antalya Travertine Plateau, which is the world’s largest deposit precipitated by cool karst groundwater. The obruks in central Tauride are giant collapse dolines formed by ascending hypogene fluids in the upper continental crust, rich in volcanogenic carbondioxide. The groundwater’s noble gas and carbon isotope data are helpful in determining the existing but asymptomatic hypogene activity in the upper crust. Hypogene karst development seems common in parts of the world with current or past geodynamic activity. However, a hydrogeological overview of the geodynamic history is essential to assess the hypogene processes and their reflections on the land surface.

Abstract In pursuing cheap and effective oxygen reduction catalysts, the Fe/N/C system emerges as a promising candidate. Nevertheless, the structural transformations of starting materials into Fe- and N-doped carbon catalysts remains poorly characterized under pyrolytic conditions. Here, we explore the evolution of Fe species and track the formation of Fe–N 4 site development by employing diverse in-situ diagnostic techniques. In-situ heating microscopy reveals the initial formation of FeO x nanoparticles and subsequent internal migration within the carbon matrix, which stops once FeO x is fully reduced. The migration and decomposition of nanoparticles then leads to carbon layer reconstruction. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveals size-dependent behavior of FeO x where nanoparticles below 7 nm readily release Fe atoms to form Fe–N 4 while nanoparticles with sizes >10 nm tend to coalesce and impede Fe–N 4 site formation. The work visualizes the pyrolysis process of Fe/N/C materials, providing theoretical guidance for the rational design of catalysts.

The oxidation of benzylic alcohols is an important transformation in modern organic synthesis. A plethora of photoredox protocols have been developed to achieve the aerobic oxidation of alcohols into carbonyls. Recently, several groups described that ultraviolet (UV) or purple light can initiate the aerobic oxidation of benzylic alcohols in the absence of an external catalyst, and depicted different mechanisms involving the photoinduction of •O2− as a critical reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, based on comprehensive mechanistic investigations, including control experiments, radical quenching experiments, EPR studies, UV–vis spectroscopy, kinetics studies, and density functional theory calculations (DFT), we elucidate here that HOO•, which is released via the H2O2 elimination of α-hydroxyl peroxyl radicals [ArCR(OH)OO•], serves as the real chain carrier for the autocatalytic photooxidation of benzylic alcohols. The mechanistic ambiguities depicted in the precedent literature are clarified, in terms of the crucial ROS and its evolution, the rate-limiting step, and the primary radical cascade. This work highlights the necessity of stricter mechanistic analyses on UV-driven oxidative reactions that involve aldehydes’ (or ketones) generation.

Abstract In this study, it is attempted to enhance the properties and biodegradability of poly(butylene adipate terephthalate) (PBAT) using nanocomposite technology to meet the demand for sustainable packaging applications. Two nanoclays containing PBAT composites are reactively processed and integrated into the multilayered films. Reactive processing facilitates the dispersion and distribution of nanoclay particles in the PBAT matrix. The multilayered films comprising reactively processed PBAT composites exhibited a 24.5%–31.5% reduction in the oxygen transmission rate and improved dimensional stability and tensile properties. Moreover, the degradability of the multilayered film comprising reactively processed PBAT composites reached 82% in 180 days. In contrast, a neat PBAT film of similar thickness attained only 53% degradation in the same period. The biodegradation mechanism is proposed based on the topology of the disintegrated films studied using scanning electron microscopy, chemical bond vibrations determined by Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, and structural evolution by small‐ and wide‐angle X‐ray scattering (SWAXS). The SWAXS analysis is used to understand the changes in the degree of crystallinity, long‐range periodic order, and crystalline and amorphous layer thickness of the multilayered films before and after degradation. Such multilayered films can find applications where packaging or biomedical devices cannot be recycled.

We conducted an investigation on the chemical abundances of 4,316 stars in the red giant branch (RGB) phase from the recently released APO-K2 catalogue. Our aim was to characterize the abundance trends of the single elements with afe , mainly focusing on C, N, and O, which are the most relevant for the estimation of stellar ages. The chemical analysis of the RGB sample involved cross-matching data from the APO-K2 catalogue with individual element abundances from APOGEE DR17. The analysis detected a statistically significant difference in the (C+N+O)/Fe -- afe trend with respect to the simple alpha -enhancement scenario. This difference remained robust across different choices for the reference solar mixture and potential zero-point calibrations of C and N abundances. The primary discrepancy was a steeper increase in O/Fe with afe , reaching a 0.1 dex difference at $ = 0.3$. Notably, the impact on the evolutionary timescale of such oxygen over-abundance with respect to the commonly adopted uniform alpha -enhancement is rather limited. We verified that stellar models computed using an ad hoc O-rich mixture sped up the evolution by only 1<!PCT!> at $ = 0.3$, due to the counterbalancing effects of O enrichment on both the evolutionary timescale and the Fe/H relationship.

The paper presents the first data on PGE sulfide and selenide mineralization formed in podiform chromitites at different stages of evolution of the Dunzhugur ophiolite massif. The chromite bodies are local-ized in listvenitized aposerpentinites, which are part of the Dunzhugur ophiolite complex. The forms of occurrence, microstructural features and compositions of platinum-group minerals in chromitites were stud-ied by scanning electron microscopy. The enrichment of chromitites with a refractory platinum group-ele-ment (PGE) sulfides and alloys in the Os-Ir-Ru system (IPGE) testify that the for-mation of magmatic platinum-group minerals (PGMs) occurred under mantle conditions. Primary PGMs were replaced by iridium sulfoarsenides and sulfoantimonides due to the interaction of mantle peridotites and chromitites with As–Sb-bearing fluid generated during dehydration and melting of the subducting slab. Native osmium was formed as a result of desulfurization of magmatic PGE-bearing sulfides with the partic-ipation of reduced fluids at the serpentinization stage. The replacement of Ru–Os sulfides by selenides of these metals in chromitites could occur at the stages of subduction or obduction at high oxygen fugacity under the influence of acid hydrothermal/metamorphogenic fluids. A qualitative assessment of physicochemical parameters of the formation of ruthenium selenides was carried out. Oxygen fugacity values estimated from the mag-netite–hematite association are log fO2 (–30.5) at 300օC and log fO2 (–40.5) at 200օC. The minimum sulfur fugacity value was determined by the stability line of laurite at 300օC, log fS2 = –20; the maximum sulfur fugacity values—by the stability line of iron and nickel sulfides: log fS2 –4.5 at 300օC and log fS2 –10.5 at 200օC. The selenium fugacity at T = 300օC is log fSe2 (–8…–13); at T = 200օC, log fSe2 (–12…–17). Au–Ag selenides were formed at T = 200օC, log fS2 (–9…–10.5); log fSe2 is from –13.5 to –20.5, log fO2 (–40). An important factor for the possibility of replacement of Ru–Os sulfides by selenides is Se occurrence in the ore-forming system. The source of Se may be the substance of the subducting slab—volcanogenic–sedimentary rocks containing fragments of Se-rich hydrothermal–sedimentary sulfide ores. They were involved in the processes of magma genesis and accompanying hydrothermal circulation.

The impact of transient reoxidation environments on the chemical morphology evolution of nonmetallic oxide inclusions in rare‐earth‐treated bearing steel is investigated using FactSage thermodynamic simulation calculations, vacuum induction furnace experiments, and high‐temperature laser confocal microscopy experiments. Thermodynamic calculations indicate a direct correlation between the initial rare‐earth content and the oxygen required to transform Ce 2 O 2 S to CeAlO 3 during secondary oxidation. Furthermore, a higher initial rare‐earth content leads to a more extensive and complete conversion to CeAlO 3 . Vacuum induction furnace experiments reveal that the inclusions transform from Ce 2 O 2 S to CeAlO 3 and Al 2 O 3 and eventually into composite oxide clusters. This results in a significant increase in inclusions, with near‐spherical Ce 2 O 2 S inclusions transforming into aggregated CeAlO 3 , leading to an increase in the average inclusion size from 2.4 to 4.2 μm. Laser confocal scanning microscopy experiments show that CeAlO 3 exhibits a higher tendency to aggregate than Ce 2 O 2 S inclusions, the primary factor contributing to the observed increase in the average inclusion size after secondary oxidation. The results of this study provide theoretical guidance for mitigating the adverse effects of rare‐earth secondary oxidation on bearing steels, particularly in terms of inclusion control.

Atmospheric chemistry plays a crucial role in the evolution of climate habitability on Venus. It has been widely explored by chemistry-transport models, but some characteristics are still poorly interpreted. This study is devoted to developing an open-access chemistry-transport model spanning both the middle and lower atmospheres of Venus. It provides a scheme for the structure of the chemistry, especially for the sulfur and oxygen, and investigates the influence of the cloud diffusivity and the SO$_ $ dissolution that are adopted in the clouds. The developed model is based on the VULCAN framework and was updated with the state-of-the-art Venusian atmospheric chemistry. It includes vertical eddy diffusion retrieved recently with the Venus Express observations, and it resolves radiative transfer containing gas absorption and scattering, Mie scattering of the cloud droplets, and absorption of the unknown UV absorber. The obtained abundance profiles of SO, SO$_ $, CO, COS, O, O$_ $, O$_ $, HCl, and NO are in overall agreement with the observations. The results show that the increase in cloud diffusivity has slight effects on the chemical structure. The SO$_ $ mainly dissolves in 50-90 km and evaporates below the clouds. The rapid dissolution-release cycle is responsible for the large upward flux of SO$_ $ at 58 km. At around 70 km, SO has a significant peak that is larger than that of previous studies by an order of magnitude, and S and SO$_ $ also show slight increases. They are attributed to the buffering effects of liquid SO$_ $ in the clouds. O$_ $ is significantly eliminated by SO in this layer. We emphasize the superior regulation of the sulfur cycle on O$_ $ at 70 km and its potential contributions to the long-standing problem of the overestimated O$_ $ abundance.

The influence of chromium‐bearing filler sand on the transformation of inclusions in high‐Mn and high‐Al steel under various reaction times and Mn content levels is studied, and the mechanism of filler sand intrusion into the steel matrix is analyzed. It is demonstrated that an inclusion containing Cr 2 O 3 is discovered. The evolution pathway of oxide inclusions is identified as Al 2 O 3 –MnO → Al 2 O 3 –MnO–SiO 2 → Al 2 O 3 –MnO–SiO 2 –Cr 2 O 3 (Cr 2 O 3 + MnO–SiO 2 ) → Al 2 O 3 –MnO–Cr 2 O 3 –MgO·Al 2 O 3 . It is noteworthy that Cr 2 O 3 inclusions tend to diffuse from the outside inward, but the internal content remains almost unchanged, which is due to the strong diffusion hindrance of SiO 2 . The formation of a liquid phase in the filler sand is a necessary condition for its infiltration into the steel matrix. The critical liquid‐phase content that results in the formation of Cr 2 O 3 inclusions is 42%, which contains 5–8% of Cr 2 O 3 . The formation of pore channels provides favorable conditions for sand penetration, with the maximum penetration depth reaching up to 29 mm. Large sand inclusion particles reach millimeter scale in size and are distributed quite randomly. Chemical reactions at the steel/sand interface can lead to an increase in the total oxygen (T.O) content in the steel. The reaction time has little effect on the T.O content, while the Mn content in the steel has a significant impact, with an increase of up to 41 ppm. During the smelting stage, the filler sand can enter the molten steel, thereby affecting the quality of the product.

The hydrocarbon activity in Pengyang area, situated in the southwestern Ordos Basin, is notably prominent. Investigation on the migration laws of hydrocarbons is imperative for comprehending the involvement in uranium mineralization. Based on the analysis of spatial distribution of hydrocarbon containing fluid and hydrocarbon generation conditions of sandstone in the Luohe Formation, the organic geochemical characteristics including hydrocarbon components, carbon isotopes and biomarker compounds were analysed. The research results indicate that: (1) hydrocarbon fluid activities in the Luohe Formation are predominantly observed in layers exhibiting higher uranium mineralization. The mudstone of the Luohe Formation had low organic matter content and low thermal maturity, which was not conducive to hydrocarbon generation. (2) Hydrocarbon‐containing fluid in the sandstone of Luohe Formation not only contained reducing gases such as methane and hydrogen but also chloroform asphalt components. The carbon isotopes of hydrocarbon in sandstone inform Luohe Formation resemble oil and gas in the Mesozoic. The biomarker parameter inferred that the parent rock of hydrocarbons in the Luohe Formation was formed under reducing and freshwater conditions, and hydrocarbon generation occurred at the mature stage. As above mentioned, a comparison was carried out between the affinity of hydrocarbon‐containing fluid in the Luohe Formation and different layers of hydrocarbon source rocks. The migration behaviour of hydrocarbon‐containing fluid in the Pengyang area has been summarized, and the involvement of hydrocarbon‐containing fluid in uranium mineralization has been discussed. The main concepts are as follows: the sedimentary environment and thermal evolution conditions of hydrocarbons in the sandstone of Luohe Formation resemble those of the primary hydrocarbon source rocks in the Yanchang Formation. The main hydrocarbon charging events in the Luohe Formation occurred before the Late Cretaceous period, which is primarily related to two hydrocarbon generation events from 130 to 100 Ma in the Yanchang Formation and fault conduits connecting the Triassic to the Cretaceous Strata. The hydrocarbon‐containing fluid released from Yanchang Formation migrating to the Luohe Formation provides reducing conditions for the precipitation of uranium in oxygen‐bearing water bodies.

Hot plasma plays a crucial role in regulating the baryon cycle within the Milky Way, flowing from the energetic sources in the Galactic center and plane, to the corona and the halo. This hot plasma represents an important fraction of the Galactic baryons, plays a key role in galactic outflows and is an important ingredient in galaxy evolution models. Taking advantage of the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG first all-sky survey (eRASS1), in this work our aim is to provide a panoramic view of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way. Compared to the previous all-sky X-ray survey performed by ROSAT, the improved energy resolution of enabled us to map, for the first time, the sky within the narrow energy bands characteristic of soft X-ray emission lines. These lines provide essential information on the physical properties of the hot plasma. Here we present the eRASS1\ half sky maps in narrow energy bands corresponding to the most prominent soft X-ray lines and which allowed us to constrain the distribution of the hot plasma within and surrounding the Milky Way. We corrected the maps by removing the expected contribution associated with the cosmic X-ray background, the time-variable solar wind charge exchange, and the local hot bubble. We applied corrections to mitigate the effect of absorption, therefore highlighting the emission from the CGM of the Milky Way. We used the line ratio of the oxygen lines as a proxy to constrain the temperature of the warm-hot CGM, and we defined a pseudo-temperature $ T $ map. The map highlights how different regions are dominated by different thermal components. Toward the outer halo, the temperature distribution of the CGM on angular scales of 2--20 deg is consistent with being constant $ T T 4<!PCT!>$ with a marginal detection of $ T T = 2.7 <!PCT!> 0.2<!PCT!>$ (statistical) $ 0.6<!PCT!>$ (systematic) in the southern hemisphere. Instead significant variations of $ 12<!PCT!>$ are observed on scales of many tens of degrees when comparing the northern and southern hemispheres. The pseudo-temperature map shows significant variations across the borders of the bubbles, suggesting temperature variations, possibly linked to shocks, between the interior of the Galactic outflow and the unperturbed CGM. In particular, a shell characterized by a lower line ratio appears close to the edge of the bubbles.    

    

## Lithium Ions as Modulators of Complex Biological Processes: The Conundrum of Multiple Targets, Responsiveness and Non-Responsiveness, and the Potential to Prevent or Correct Dysregulation of Systems during Aging and in Disease

Lithium is one of the lightest elements on Earth and it has been in the environment since the formation of the galaxy. While a common element, it has not been found to be an essential element in biological processes, ranging from single cell organisms to Homo sapiens. Instead, at an early stage of evolution, organisms committed to a range of elements such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron to serve essential functions. Such ions serve critical functions in ion channels, as co-factors in enzymes, as a cofactor in oxygen transport, in DNA replication, as a storage molecule in bone and liver, and in a variety of other roles in biological processes. While seemingly excluded from a major essential role in such processes, lithium ions appear to be able to modulate a variety of biological processes and “correct” deviation from normal activity, as a deficiency of lithium can have biological consequences. Lithium salts are found in low levels in many foods and water supplies, but the effectiveness of Li salts to affect biological systems came to recent prominence with the work of Cade, who reported that administrating Li salts calmed guinea pigs and was subsequently effective at relatively high doses to “normalize” a subset of patients with bipolar disorders. Because of its ability to modulate many biological pathways and processes (e.g., cyclic AMP, GSK-3beta, inositol metabolism, NaK ATPases, neuro processes and centers, immune-related events, respectively) both in vitro and in vivo and during development and adult life, Li salts have become both a useful tool to better understand the molecular regulation of such processes and to also provide insights into altered biological processes in vivo during aging and in disease states. While the range of targets for lithium action supports its possible role as a modulator of biological dysregulation, it presents a conundrum for researchers attempting to elucidate its specific primary target in different tissues in vivo. This review will discuss aspects of the state of knowledge regarding some of the systems that can be influenced, focusing on those involving neural and autoimmunity as examples, some of the mechanisms involved, examples of how Li salts can be used to study model systems, as well as suggesting areas where the use of Li salts could lead to additional insights into both disease mechanisms and natural processes at the molecular and cell levels. In addition, caveats regarding lithium doses used, the strengths and weaknesses of rodent models, the background genetics of the strain of mice or rats employed, and the sex of the animals or the cells used, are discussed. Low-dose lithium may have excellent potential, alone or in combination with other interventions to prevent or alleviate aging-associated conditions and disease progression.

Abstract. Black shale sediments from the Barremian to Aptian South Atlantic document the intense and widespread burial of marine organic carbon during the initial stages of seafloor spreading between Africa and South America. The enhanced sequestration of atmospheric CO2 makes these young ocean basins potential drivers of the Early Cretaceous carbon cycle and climate perturbations. The opening of marine gateways between initially restricted basins and related circulation and ventilation changes are a commonly invoked explanation for the transient formation and disappearance of these regional carbon sinks. However, large uncertainties in palaeogeographic reconstructions limit the interpretation of available palaeoceanographic data and prevent any robust model-based quantifications of the proposed circulation and carbon burial changes. Here, we present a new approach to assess the principal controls on the Early Cretaceous South Atlantic and Southern Ocean circulation changes under full consideration of the uncertainties in available boundary conditions. Specifically, we use a large ensemble of 36 climate model experiments to simulate the Barremian to Albian progressive opening of the Falkland Plateau and Georgia Basin gateways with different configurations of the proto-Drake Passage, the Walvis Ridge, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The experiments are designed to complement available geochemical data across the regions and to test circulation scenarios derived from them. All simulations show increased evaporation and intermediate water formation at subtropical latitudes that drive a meridional overturning circulation whose vertical extent is determined by the sill depth of the Falkland Plateau. The densest water masses formed in the southern Angola Basin and potentially reached the deep Cape Basin as Walvis Ridge Overflow Water. Palaeogeographic uncertainties are as important as the lack of precise knowledge of atmospheric CO2 levels for the simulated temperature and salinity spread in large parts of the South Atlantic. Overall temperature uncertainties reach up to 15 °C and increase significantly with water depth. The ensemble approach reveals temporal changes in the relative importance of geographic and radiative forcings for the simulated oceanographic conditions and, importantly, nonlinear interactions between them. The progressive northward opening of the highly restricted Angola Basin increased the sensitivity of local overturning and upper-ocean stratification to atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to large-scale changes in the hydrological cycle, while the chosen proto-Drake Passage depth is critical for the ocean dynamics and CO2 response in the southern South Atlantic. Finally, the simulated processes are integrated into a recent carbon burial framework to document the principal control of the regional gateway evolution on the progressive shift from the prevailing saline and oxygen-depleted subtropical water masses to the dominance of ventilated high-latitude deep waters.
