Abstract Anionic redox allows the direct formation of O─O bonds from lattice oxygens and provides higher catalytic in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than does the conventional metal ion mechanism. While previous theories have predicted and experiments have suggested the possible O─O bond, it has not yet been directly observed in the OER process. In this study, operando soft X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) at the O K‐edge and the operando Raman spectra is performed on layered double CoFe hydroxides (LDHs) after intercalation with [Cr(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3− , and revealed a three‐step oxidation process, staring from Co 2+ to Co 3+ , further to Co 4+ (3d6L), and ultimately leading to the formation of O─O bonds and O 2 evolution above a threshold voltage (1.4 V). In contrast, a gradual oxidation of Fe is observed in CoFe LDHs. The OER activity exhibits a significant enhancement, with the overpotential decreasing from 300 to 248 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , following the intercalation of [Cr(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3− into CoFe LDHs, underscoring a crucial role of anionic redox in facilitating water splitting.

Understanding the influence of surface structural features at a molecular level is beneficial in guiding an electrode's mechanistic proposals for electrocatalytic reactions. The relationship between structural stability and catalytic activity significantly impacts reaction performance, even though atomistic knowledge of active sites remains a topic of discussion. In this context, this work presents scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results for the highly ordered arrangement of manganese porphyrin molecules on a Au(111) surface; STM allows us to monitor active sites at a molecular level to focus on long-standing issues with the electrocatalytic process, especially the exact nature of the real active sites at the interfaces. After water oxidation, manganese porphyrin rapidly decomposes into active catalytic species as bright protrusions. These newly formed active species drastically lost catalytic activity, up to 82%, through only acid treatment, one of the oxide removal methods, not by deionized water and acetone treatments. STM results of the obviated active species on the Au surface by an acidic solution support the forfeited catalytic activity. In addition, it shows a 67% decrement in catalytic activity by adsorption of phosphonic acid, one of the oxide's preferred adsorption materials, compared to the pristine one. Based on these observations, we confirm that the newly formed active species, as water oxidation catalysts, mostly consist of manganese oxides. Notable findings of our work provide molecular evidence for the active sites of Au and modified Au electrodes that spur the future development of water oxidation catalysts.

Transition metal oxides, particularly NiFe(OH)2, are recognized for their high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and structural stability. However, their performance in natural seawater electrolysis remains insufficiently studied. Manganese dioxide (MnO2), which is known for its multiple crystal phases and high OER selectivity, can be incorporated to enhance the catalytic properties. In this study, the OER catalytic performance of carbon cloth-supported manganese dioxide-modified nickel–iron bimetallic hydroxide (MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC) electrodes was explored in both alkaline and natural seawater. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode achieved overpotentials of 284 mV and 363 mV at current densities of 10 mA·cm−2 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively, with a Tafel slope of 68.6 mV·dec−1 in alkaline seawater. Most importantly, the prepared MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode maintained stable OER performance over 120 h of testing. In natural seawater, the MnO2-NiFe-LDH/CC electrode outperformed the NiFe-LDH/CC electrode by exhibiting an oxygen evolution selectivity of 61.1%. This study highlights the potential of MnO2-modified nickel–iron-based materials for efficient and stable OER in seawater electrolysis, which offers a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production in coastal desert regions.

Searching for high energy-density electrode materials for sodium ion batteries has revealed Na-deficient intercalation compounds with lattice oxygen redox as promising high-capacity cathodes. However, anionic redox reactions commonly encountered poor electrochemical reversibility and unfavorable structural transformations during dynamic (de)sodiation processes. To address this issue, we employed lithium orbital hybridization chemistry to create Na-O-Li configuration in a prototype P2-layered Na

A comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes at the catalyst/electrolyte interfaces is crucial for the development of advanced electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the chemical processes related to surface corrosion and catalyst degradation have not been well understood so far. In this study, we employ LiCoO 2 as a model catalyst and observe distinct OER activities and surface stabilities in different alkaline solutions. Operando X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and online mass spectroscopy (OMS) measurements prove the selective intercalation of alkali cations into the layered structure of LiCoO 2 during OER. It is proposed that the dynamic cation intercalations facilitate the chemical oxidation process between highly oxidative Co species and adsorbed water molecules, triggering the so‐called electrochemical‐chemical reaction mechanism (EC‐mechanism). The results of this study emphasize the influence of cations on OER and provide insights into new strategies for achieving both high activity and stability in high‐performance OER catalysts.

Abstract Oxygen redox in layered oxide cathodes for Na‐ion batteries is considered a promising approach for improving the energy density. However, oxygen‐redox‐based cathodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and undesirable structural change during charge/discharge, leading to poor electrochemical performances. Herein, introducing vacancies (□) in the transition metal layers enables the enhanced oxygen redox‐based electrochemical performances in the P3‐type Mn‐based layered oxide cathode is demonstrated. The vacancies can play a role of the local distortion buffers, resulting in the enhanced oxygen redox kinetics and the suppressed structural deformation such as P3‐O3(II) phase transition. The oxygen‐redox‐based P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 exhibits the large discharge capacity of ≈140.95 mAh g −1 at 26 mA g −1 with a high average discharge voltage of ≈3.54 V (vs Na + /Na). Even at 650 mA g −1 , its discharge capacity and average operation voltages delivered ≈122.06 mAh g −1 and ≈3.22 V, respectively. Especially, the small gap of average discharge voltage indicates both improves power‐capability and enhanced kinetics of oxygen redox in P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 . Moreover, the vacancy buffer in the transition metal layers results in the stable cycle‐performance of P3‐type Na 0.56 [Ni 0.1 Mn 0.81 □ 0.09 ]O 2 with the capacity retention of ≈80.80% for 100 cycles, due to the suppressed P3‐O3(II) phase transition.

Abstract Multinuclear metal clusters are ideal candidates to catalyze small molecule activation reactions involving the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, on constructing an unparalleled Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster within porphyrin‐based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and the electrocatalytic features of such Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is reported. The reaction of Co II sulfate and metal complexes of tetrakis(4‐pyridyl)porphyrin under solvothermal conditions afforded Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs (M═Co, Cu, and Zn). Crystallographic studies revealed that these Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs have the same framework structure, having the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters connected by metalloporphyrin units through Co─N pyridyl bonds. In the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster, the four Co II ions are chemically and symmetrically equivalent and are each coordinated with four sulfate O atoms to give a distorted cube‐like structure. Electrocatalytic studies showed that these Co 4 ‐M‐MOFs are all active for electrocatalytic OER and ORR. Importantly, by regulating the activity of the metalloporphyrin units, it is confirmed that the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster is active for oxygen electrocatalysis. With the use of Co porphyrins as connecting units, Co 4 ‐Co‐MOF displays the highest electrocatalytic activity in this series of MOFs by showing a 10 mA cm −2 OER current density at 357 mV overpotential and an ORR half‐wave potential at 0.83 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of two proximal Co atoms in the Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 cluster in OER by facilitating the formation of O─O bonds. This work is of fundamental significance to present the construction of Co 4 (SO 4 ) 4 clusters in framework structures for oxygen electrocatalysis and to demonstrate the cooperation between two proximal Co atoms in such clusters during the O─O bond formation process.

Abstract The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) from O 2 or H 2 O via the two‐electron (2e − ) oxygen reduction (2e − ORR) or water oxidation (2e − WOR) reaction provides a green and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, a paired‐electrosynthesis tactic is reported for concerted H 2 O 2 production at a high rate by coupling the 2e − ORR and 2e − WOR, in which the bifunctional oxygen‐vacancy‐enriched Bi 2 O 3 nanorods (O v ‐Bi 2 O 3 ‐EO), obtained through electrochemically oxidative reconstruction of Bi‐based metal–organic framework (Bi‐MOF) nanorod precursor, are used as both efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, achieving concurrent H 2 O 2 production at both electrodes with high Faradaic efficiencies. Specifically, the coupled 2e − ORR//2e − WOR electrolysis system based on such distinctive oxygen‐defect Bi catalyst displays excellent performance for the paired‐electrosynthesis of H 2 O 2 , delivering a remarkable cell Faradaic efficiency of 154.8% and an ultrahigh H 2 O 2 production rate of 4.3 mmol h −1 cm −2 . Experiments combined with theoretical analysis reveal the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in optimizing the adsorption of intermediates associated with the selective two‐electron reaction pathways, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of the 2e − reaction processes at both electrodes. This work establishes a new paradigm for developing advanced electrocatalysts and designing novel paired‐electrolysis systems for scalable and sustainable H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis.

Abstract The synthesis of nitrate by the electrochemical N 2 oxidation reaction (NOR) is currently one of the most promising routes. However, the traditional generation of nitrate depends on the oxidation reaction between N 2 and H 2 O (or ·OH), which involves complex reaction steps and intermediates, showing strong competition from oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, an effective NOR method is proposed to directly oxidize N 2 by using O 3 as a reactive oxygen source to reduce the reaction step. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the nitrate yield of Pd‐Mn 3 O 4 /CNT electrocatalyst reaches the milligram level, which is the highest yield reported so far for electrocatalytic NOR. Quantitative characterization is employed to establish a comprehensive set of benchmarks to confirm the intrinsic nature of nitrogen activation and test the O 3 ‐mediated reaction mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the heterostructure Pd‐Mn 3 O 4 leads to a strong adsorption preference for N 2 and O 3 , which greatly reduces the activation energy barrier for N 2 . This accelerates the synthesis of nitrate based on the direct formation mechanism, which reduces energy barriers and the reaction steps, thus increasing the performance of electrocatalytic nitrate production. The techno‐economic analysis underscores the promising feasibility and sustainable economic value of the presented method.

The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/non‐magnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core‐shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores’ local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells’ surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen‐containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128% at 1.63 V and an overpotential reduction by 28 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100 h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.

Abstract Electrochemical splitting of water for hydrogen generation has emerged as a potential strategy for transitioning towards renewable energy sources and mitigating the environmental impact of fossil fuel dependence. However, the efficiency of water splitting is mainly hindered by oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side, which involves kinetically sluggish four proton‐coupled electron‐transfer steps. Recent studies on OER demonstrate that a spin‐dependent mechanism governs the reaction kinetics, wherein the electronic exchange interactions in the catalytic activity of transition metals can provide a spin‐selective channel to filter out electron spins with the right orientation during the formation of O 2 . Maximizing efficiency and stability of such catalysts require optimization the geometric and electrical structures of transition metal systems. In addition, it is vital to understand the OER mechanism with spin considerations to be familiar with the connection between spin, charge, orbital, and lattice characteristics. This review focuses on current developments in understanding and the use of the spin‐related effect in the OER mechanism.

Introducing multiple active sites and constructing a heterostructure are efficient strategies to develop high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, two-dimensional heterostructure NiFeP@FeOOH nanosheets supported by nickel foam (NF) are prepared by a hydrothermal–phosphorization–electrodeposition process. The synthesis of self-supporting heterostructure NiFeP@FeOOH nanosheets on NF increases the specific surface region, while bimetallic phosphide realizes rapid charge transfer, improving the electron transfer rate. The introduction of FeOOH and the construction of a heterostructure result in a synergistic effect among the components, and the surface-active sites are abundant. In situ Raman spectroscopy showed that the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance was due to reconstruction-induced hydroxyl oxide, which achieved a multi-active site reaction. The NiFeP@FeOOH/NF electrocatalytic activity was then significantly improved. The findings indicate that in a 1.0 M KOH alkaline solution, NiFeP@FeOOH/NF showed an OER overpotential of 235 mV at 100 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 46.46 mV dec−1, and it worked stably at 50 mA cm−2 for 80 h. This research proves that constructing heterostructure and introducing FeOOH are of great significance to the study of the properties of OER electrocatalysts.

The pursuit of carbon‐neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni‐based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine‐rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser‐ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L‐LFP), derived from spent Li‐ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43– species, formed around L‐LFP, effectively repels Cl− ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH– adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high‐performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

Abstract This work illustrates the practicality and economic benefits of employing a hetero‐interfaced electrocatalyst (CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH), containing cobalt sulphide and iron‐cobalt double‐layer hydroxide for large‐scale hydrogen generation. Here, the rational synthesis and detailed characterization of the CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH material to unravel its unique heterostructure are essayed. The CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH operates as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to trigger both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline seawater (pH 14.0) while showcasing low overpotential requirement for HER (311 mV) and OER (450 mV) at 100 mA cm − 2 current density. The identical CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH on either electrode in an H‐cell setup results in simultaneous H 2 and O 2 production from seawater with a ≈98% Faradaic efficiency with an applied potential of 1.96V@100 mA cm − 2 . Next, this CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH catalyst is deployed on both sides of a membrane electrode assembly in a one‐stack electrolyzer, which retains the intrinsic bifunctional reactivity of the catalyst to generate H 2 and O 2 in tandem from alkaline seawater with an impeccable energy efficiency (50 kWh kg −1 ‐of‐H 2 ). This electrolyzer assembly can be directly linked with a Si‐solar cell to produce truly green hydrogen with a solar‐to‐hydrogen generation efficiency of 15.88%, highlighting the potential of this converting seawater to hydrogen under solar irradiation.

Fe has been reported to play a crucial role in improving the catalytic activity and stability of Ni/Co-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while the Fe effect remains intangible. Here, we design several experiments to identify the activity and stability improvement using porous anodized nickel foam (ANF) as the electrode and 1.0 M KOH containing 1000 μM Fe(III) ions as the electrolyte. Systematic investigations reveal that Ni sites serve as hosts to capture Fe ions to create active FeNi-based intermediates on the surface of ANF to improve the OER activity significantly, and Fe ions regulate catalytic equilibrium and maintain the stability for a long time. The system exhibits 242 and 343 mV overpotentials to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm

Abstract Efficient and stable catalysts are in high demand for accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a high‐entropy sulfide (HES) of (FeCoNiCrCuAl)S@HCS with a 3D structure is successfully prepared by utilizing a simple one‐step solvothermal method and employed as catalyst toward OER. The lower electronegativity of Al compared to the other metal elements and its anti‐corrosion character enable an outstanding OER performance of (FeCoNiCrCuAl)S@HCS with an overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and an excellent durability after 20 000 CV cycles, outperforming the commercial RuO 2 and most reported metal‐sulfide catalysts. Experiments coupled with theoretical calculations reveal that Al atom primarily serves as electron donor and promotes a redistribution of local electrons from Co and Cr toward adjacent Fe, Ni, and Cu sites. As a result, the Cr‐Al site possesses a lowest energy barrier during the rate‐determining step and works as the dominant active site for OER process. This study provides a novel insight and strategy into structural design and performance enhancement for HES materials.

Developing energy‐ and time‐efficient strategies to derive high‐performance non‐precious electrocatalysts for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), especially stably working at industrial‐demanding current density, is still a big challenge. In this work, a concise molten salt erosion scenario was devised to rapidly modulate the smooth surface of the commercial NiMo foam substrate into the rough, electronically coupled, and hierarchically porous Ni/Fe/Mo(oxy)hydroxide catalyst layer assembled by the nanosphere array. This self‐supported catalyst is super‐hydrophilic for the alkaline electrolyte and distinguished by a balanced Mo leaching/surface‐readsorption process to tune the metal d band center and electronic perturbation. The altered electronic environment with the favored OER intermediate adsorption behavior attains the outstanding OER activity in terms of a very small overpotential of 230.21 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and an ultra‐long stability for 1179.45 h to sustain the initial commercial‐level current density of ca. 1000 mA cm‐2. This superb performance transcends most of the edge‐cutting transition metal peers reported recently and can satisfy the standards of industrial applications. This industrial‐compatible synthesis technology holds profound implications for hydrogen production via water splitting and other electrochemical applications.

Designing a high-performing iridium (Ir) single-atom catalyst is desired for acidic water electrolysis, which shows enormous potential given its high catalytic activity toward acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with minimum usage of precious Ir metal. However, it still remains a substantial challenge to stabilize the Ir single atoms during the OER operation without sacrificing the activity. Here, we report a high-performing OER catalyst by immobilizing Ir single atoms on a polyimide support, which exhibits a high mass activity on a carbon paper electrode while simultaneously achieving outstanding stability with negligible decay for 360 h. The resulting electrode (denoted as Ir

Abstract Development of high‐performance, low‐cost catalysts for electrochemical water splitting is key to sustainable hydrogen production. Herein, ultrafast synthesis of carbon‐supported ruthenium–copper (RuCu/C) nanocomposites is reported by magnetic induction heating, where the rapid Joule's heating of RuCl 3 and CuCl 2 at 200 A for 10 s produces Ru–Cl residues‐decorated Ru nanocrystals dispersed on a CuCl x scaffold, featuring effective Ru to Cu charge transfer. Among the series, the RuCu/C‐3 sample exhibits the best activity in 1 m KOH toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an overpotential of only −23 and +270 mV to reach 10 mA cm −2 , respectively. When RuCu/C‐3 is used as bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.53 V is needed to produce 10 mA cm −2 , markedly better than that with a mixture of commercial Pt/C+RuO 2 (1.59 V). In situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the bifunctional activity is due to reduction of the Ru–Cl residues at low electrode potentials that enriches metallic Ru and oxidation at high electrode potentials that facilitates the formation of amorphous RuO x . These findings highlight the unique potential of MIH in the ultrafast synthesis of high‐performance catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.

Abstract The design of a low‐iridium‐loading anode catalyst layer with high activity and durability is a key challenge for a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, the synthesis of a novel supported IrO 2 nanocatalyst with a tri‐layered structure, dubbed IrO 2 @TaO x @TaB that is composed of ultrasmall IrO 2 nanoparticles anchored on amorphous TaO x overlayer of TaB nanorods is reported. The composite electrocatalyst shows great activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, thanks to its dual‐interface structural feature. The electronic interaction in IrO 2 /TaO x interface can regulate the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, the Ir 3+ / Ir 4+ ratio, and the redox peak potential of IrO 2 for enhancing OER activity, while the dense TaO x overlayer can prevent further oxidation of TaB substrate and stabilize the IrO 2 catalytic layers for improving structural stability during OER. The IrO 2 @TaO x @TaB can be used to fabricate an anode catalyst layer of PEMWE with an iridium‐loading as low as 0.26 mg cm −2 . The low‐iridium‐loading PEMWE delivers high current densities at low cell voltages (e.g., 3.9 A cm −2 @2.0 V), and gives excellent activity retention for more than 1500 h at 2.0 A cm −2 current density.

Electrolytic hydrogen production from water is a promising approach for obtaining clean energy. The development of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for the generation of hydrogen through water electrolysis. Transition metal oxides, such as Fe, Co, and Mn, have shown potential as efficient OER electrocatalysts for water splitting. However, accurately predicting their electrocatalytic performance in complex compositional spaces remains a challenge, impeding the precise design of compositions and processes for optimal performance. Herein, a machine learning-based method is proposed for predicting the OER activity of (FeCoMn)Ox catalysts across a wide range of compositions. Physical features that are highly relevant to the OER overpotential (OP) are identified and analyzed. The random forest algorithm is successfully used to establish the relationship between composition and overpotential. The model demonstrates good accuracy in predicting the outcomes of new experiments, with a mean relative error (MRE) of 9.3%. The features based on covalent radius (RC) and the number of electrons in the outermost d orbitals (DEs) are the primary factors. Their variances (δRC and δDE) exhibit a linearly decreasing relationship with the overpotential (OP), providing direct guidance for designing OP-oriented components. This work presents an effective and innovative approach for predicting and analyzing the physical factors of transition metal oxide electrocatalysts, which can enhance the design of highly catalytic materials for electrocatalysis.

The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/non-magnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core-shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores' local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells' surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen-containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128% at 1.63 V and an overpotential reduction by 28 mV at 10 mA cm-2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100 h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.

NiCo2O4 has been proven to show high electrocatalytic activity, however facile and inexpensive techniques for preparation of this compound as mesostructured thin film is lacking. In this study, the sol‐gel synthesis of nanocrystalline mesoporous spinel NiCo2O4 thin films by dip‐coating and soft‐templating using the evaporation‐induced self‐assembly approach is reported. The morphology and crystallographic structure were thoroughly probed by various physicochemical characterization techniques collectively validating the development of uniform mesoporous NiCo2O4 architectures crystallizing exclusively in the cubic spinel phase after calcination in air. The surface area of the thin films depended on the calcination temperature. XPS investigations showed that the amount of Ni3+ and defective oxygen species increased for decreasing calcination temperatures. The overall electrochemical surface area, Ni3+ content, charge transfer resistance, and amount of defective oxygen sites were found to collectively control the oxygen evolution reaction performance. After an optimized annealing procedure at 300°C and chronopotentiometric analysis at 10 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h, a low overpotential of 330 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline solution was achieved. The results highlight the necessity of precise selection of the appropriate calcination temperature and electrochemical pre‐treatment conditions for adjusting the concentration of electrocatalytically active reaction sites of sol‐gel‐derived NiCo2O4 thin films.

Graphene oxide (GO) has shown significant potential in humidity sensing. It is well accepted that the oxygen-containing functional groups in GO significantly influence its humidity sensing performance. However, the relationship between the content of these groups and the humidity sensing capability of GO-based sensors remains unclear. In the present work, we investigate the role of oxygen-containing functional groups in the humidity sensing performance by oxidizing graphite with mesh numbers 80–120, 325, and 8000 using the Hummers method, resulting in GO-80, GO-325, and GO-8000. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to identify the types and quantification of oxygen-containing functional groups. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to simulate the adsorption energy, intercalation dynamics, and hydrogen bonding of water molecules. Electrochemical tests were used to compare the adsorption/desorption time and response sensitivity of graphene oxide to humidity. It is proposed that hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are the main contributing groups to humidity sensing. GO-8000 shows a relatively fast response time, but the large number of carboxyl groups will hinder intercalation of water molecules, thus exhibiting lower sensitivity. This research provides a reference for the future development of graphene-based sensors, catalysts, and environmental materials.

Microstructural evolution of inner oxide layer of a Si-modified austenitic stainless steel exposed to oxygen-saturated static lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) at 550 °C up to 3000 h has been investigated. A dual-phase separated structure consisting of Fe-Cr spinel and (Fe, Cr)1-xNix phase is formed in inner oxide layer, attributed to partitioning of Ni and Cr associated with Fe-Cr spinel formation. SiO2 is preferentially formed preceding the Fe-Cr spinel at internal oxidation frontier, leading to dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles within Fe-Cr spinel. The mechanism of LBE penetration into inner oxide layer is further developed based on preferable dissolution process of (Fe, Cr)1-xNix phase.

The slow oxygen evolution kinetics of iron oxide nanorod arrays have limited their applications in photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we introduce p-type semiconductor cuprous oxide and further cover cobalt hydroxide ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of both by electrochemical deposition; these methods obviously enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance of iron oxide nanorods on titanium sheet substrate. The photocurrent of this heterostructure reached 4.8 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution under AM 1.5G illumination, which is much higher than the currently reported photocatalytic water splitting performance of iron oxide nanoarrays. The construction of Fe2O3/Cu2S p-n heterojunction accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers in the main body of Fe2O3 nanorod arrays; as an excellent oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC), the introduction of Co(OH)x accelerates the kinetic process of interfacial water oxidation leading to the rapid depletion of photogenerated holes, which further improves the charge separation on the photoanode surface. Thus, the synergistic effect between Fe2O3/Cu2S p-n heterojunctions and oxygen evolution catalysts enhanced the iron oxide nanorod array photoanodes.

Oxygen evolution reaction is the essential anodic reaction for water splitting. Designing tunable electronic structures to overcome its slow kinetics is an effective strategy. Herein, the molecular ammonium iron sulfate dodecahydrate is employed as the precursor to synthesize the C, N, S triatomic co-doped Fe(Al)OOH on Ni foam (C,N,S-Fe(Al)OOH-NF) with asymmetric electronic structure. Both in situ oxygen vacancies and their special electronic configuration enable the electron transfer between the d-p orbitals and get the increase of OER activity. Density functional theory calculation further indicates the effect of electronic structure on catalytic activity and stability at the oxygen vacancies. In alkaline solution, the catalyst C,N,S-Fe(Al)OOH-NF shows good catalytic activity and stability for water splitting. For OER, the overpotential of 10 mA cm

Abstract Crystalline perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, particularly for anodic oxygen evolution reactions, owing to their low cost and high intrinsic activity. Perovskite oxides with noncrystalline or amorphous characteristics also exhibit promising electrocatalytic performance toward electrochemical water splitting. In this review, a fundamental understanding of the characteristics and advantages of crystalline, noncrystalline, and amorphous perovskite oxides is presented. Subsequently, recent progress in the development of advanced electrocatalysts for water electrolysis by engineering and breaking the crystallinity of perovskite oxides is reviewed, with a special focus on the underlying structure–activity relationships. Finally, the remaining challenges and unsolved issues are presented, and an outlook is briefly proposed for the future exploration of next‐generation water‐splitting electrocatalysts based on perovskite oxides.

Abstract Tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on intratumoral free radicals, while the limited oxygen source and the depletion of tissue oxygen may exacerbate the hypoxia. As the treatment progresses, there will eventually be a problem of insufficient free radicals. Here, it is found that Au@CeO 2 nano‐rods (Au@Ce NRs), assembled by gold nano‐rods (Au NRs) and ceria nanoparticles (CeO 2 NPs), can efficaciously absorb near‐infrared light (NIR) to promote the release of oxygen and free radicals. Au@Ce NRs exhibit a higher proportion of Ce 3+ (Ce 2 O 3 ) after oxygen release, while Ce 3+ is subsequently oxidized to Ce 4+ (CeO 2 ) by trace H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, Au@Ce NRs re‐oxidized by trace H 2 O 2 can re‐releasing oxygen and free radicals again upon NIR treatment, achieving oxygenation/oxygen evolution, similar to charging/discharging. This loop maximizes the conversion of limited oxygen source into highly cytotoxic free radicals. As a result, when B16‐F10 cells are treated by NIR/Au@Ce NRs, more tumor cells undergo apoptosis, consistent with the higher level of free radicals. Importantly, NIR/Au@Ce NRs successfully suppresses tumor growth and promotes the generation of epidermal collagen fibers in the transplanted tumor model. Therefore, the rod‐shaped Au@Ce NRs provide an ideal platform for maximizing the utilization of intratumoral oxygen sources and improving the treatment of melanoma.

Abstract In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to produce high-value products. Most studies have focused solely on the photocatalytic properties of the electrodes, overlooking their electrocatalytic properties and the different products obtained under dark conditions. Our work aims to address this gap by comparing the electrocatalytic activity under dark and light conditions to determine whether light influences the reactivity of the electrodes or if it just reduces the overpotential of the reaction. To achieve this, we employed two model semiconductors, TiO2 and BiVO4. We have analyzed their polarization curves under both dark and light conditions and evaluated the competence of glycerol oxidation reaction with the oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, we conducted long-term (photo)electrolysis revealing the beneficial role of light on the electrolytic process, as it enables the obtention of C3 products on illuminated TiO2 photoanodes at low electrode polarization, comparable to the performance of BiVO4.

To improve the stability of high-temperature water electrolysis, I prepared membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) using a decal method and investigated their water electrolysis properties. Nafion 115 and crosslinked sulfonated polyphenylsulfone (CSPPSU) membranes were used. IrO2 was used as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and Pt/C was used as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. The conductivity of the CSPPSU membrane at 80 °C and 90% RH (relative humidity) is about four times lower than that of the Nafion 115 membrane. Single-cell water electrolysis was performed while measuring the current density and performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at cell temperatures from 80 to 150 °C and the stability of the current density over time at 120 °C and 1.7 V. The current density of water electrolysis using Nafion 115 and CSPPSU membranes at 150 °C and 2 V was 1.2 A/cm2 for both. The current density of the water electrolysis using the CSPPSU membrane at 120 °C and 1.7 V was stable for 40 h. The decal method improved the contact between the CSPPSU membrane and the catalyst electrode, and a stable current density was obtained.

Electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation (EAO) is an attractive alternative to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical hydrogen evolution cells. However, the development of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts is a major challenge. Herein, we developed a nitrogen-doped bimetallic oxide electrocatalyst (WO-N/NF) by a one-step hydrothermal method for the selective electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid in alkaline electrolytes. The WO-N/NF electrode features block-shaped particles on a rough, inhomogeneous surface with cracks and lumpy nodules, increasing active sites and enhancing electrolyte diffusion. The electrode demonstrates exceptional activity, stability, and selectivity, achieving efficient benzoic acid production while reducing the electrolysis voltage. A low onset potential of 1.38 V (vs. RHE) is achieved to reach a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with only 0.2 mmol of metal precursors, which is 396 mV lower than that of water oxidation. The analysis reveals a yield, conversion, and selectivity of 98.41%, 99.66%, and 99.74%, respectively, with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.77%. This work provides insight into the rational design of a highly active and selective catalyst for electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR), requiring less energy to produce hydrogen, is considered as a potential alternative to the traditional oxygen evolution reaction. Consequently, developing highly efficient UOR catalysts to facilitate H2 production has garnered widespread attention. A promising approach to enhancing the effectiveness of these electrocatalysts is defect engineering. By introducing structural defects, defect engineering can expose more active sites and optimize their electronic structure, thereby improving their activity. This work offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress in defect engineering of nickel-based electrocatalysts for the UOR. It summarizes various strategies for generating defects, including the creation of vacancies, doping, the incorporation of single atoms, amorphization, and achieving high refractivity. Furthermore, we discuss the advanced characterization techniques commonly used to identify the presence of defects in these electrocatalysts, as well as to determine their detailed structures. Finally, we outline the prospects and challenges associated with the systematic design and fabrication of novel UOR electrocatalysts with tunable defects, aiming to further enhance their efficiency and stability.

Hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions catalyzed by transition metals have sluggish kinetics during prolonged water electrolysis in neutral media. Covering the surface with an amorphous protecting layer can improve the reactivity and stability of these catalysts; however, the rational design of crystalline–amorphous electrocatalysts for efficient and stable water electrolysis in neutral media has been challenging. Here, we present a unique and facile strategy for the in situ synthesis of the heterophase-structured cNiMo(S)/aNiMoP catalyst with a crystalline–amorphous phase boundary. The high-density active sites present on the surface and at the interface of the heterophase is responsible for the excellent electrochemical activity and operational stability of water electrolysis in neutral media. For the overall water splitting reaction, the cNiMo(S)/aNiMoP || cNiMo(S)/aNiMoP system displays a low cell voltage of 1.67 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm−2. Moreover, negligible performance degradation was observed during a continuous long-term stability test for 100 h.

The implementation of nanocomposite materials as electrode layers represents a potential turning point for next-generation of solid oxide cells in order to reduce the use of critical raw materials. However, the substitution of bulk electrode materials by thin films is still under debate especially due to the uncertainty about their performance and stability under operando conditions, which restricts their use in real applications. In this work, we propose a multiphase nanocomposite characterized by a highly disordered microstructure and high cationic intermixing as a result from thin-film self-assembly of a perovskite-based mixed ionic-electronic conductor (lanthanum strontium cobaltite) and a fluorite-based pure ionic conductor (samarium-doped ceria) as an oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells. Electrochemical characterization shows remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (fuel cell mode) and oxygen evolution activity (electrolysis mode) in comparison with state-of-the-art bulk electrodes, combined with outstanding long-term stability at operational temperatures of 700 °C. The disordered nanostructure was implemented as a standalone oxygen electrode on commercial anode-supported cells, resulting in high electrical output in fuel cell and electrolysis mode for active layer thicknesses of only 200 nm (>95% decrease in critical raw materials with respect to conventional cathodes). The cell was operated for over 300 h in fuel cell mode displaying excellent stability. Our findings unlock the hidden potential of advanced thin-film technologies for obtaining high-performance disordered electrodes based on nanocomposite self-assembly combining long durability and minimized use of critical raw materials.

The metabolism of phototrophic cyanobacteria is an integral part of global biogeochemical cycles, and the capability of cyanobacteria to assimilate atmospheric CO2 into organic carbon has manifold potential applications for a sustainable biotechnology. To elucidate the properties of cyanobacterial metabolism and growth, computational reconstructions of genome-scale metabolic networks play an increasingly important role. Here, we present an updated reconstruction of the metabolic network of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and its quantitative evaluation using flux balance analysis (FBA). To overcome limitations of conventional FBA, and to allow for the integration of experimental analyses, we develop a novel approach to describe light absorption and light utilization within the framework of FBA. Our approach incorporates photoinhibition and a variable quantum yield into the constraint-based description of light-limited phototrophic growth. We show that the resulting model is capable of predicting quantitative properties of cyanobacterial growth, including photosynthetic oxygen evolution and the ATP/NADPH ratio required for growth and cellular maintenance. Our approach retains the computational and conceptual simplicity of FBA and is readily applicable to other phototrophic microorganisms.

Abstract High entropy perovskite oxide (HEPO) materials have received significant interest as efficient electrocatalysts owing to their chemical and structural stability, effective interaction of multiple metal active sites with the reaction intermediate species resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. The effect of high‐entropy strategy could achieve the regulation of the structural durability by tailoring the composition. Herein, we design a novel transition metal and rare‐earth metal based high entropy perovskite oxide (Co 0.11 Mn 0.11 Ni 0.11 Fe 0.14 La 0.13 Nd 0.13 Gd 0.13 Pr 0.13 )O 3, showing superior catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and also promising electrocatalyst in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High degree of cationic dispersion in the lattice and multiple electrocatalytic active sites enhance the oxygen ion migration at the surface and facilitate electron transfer, manifesting good ORR performance. Notably, the as‐prepared high entropy material exhibits onset and half‐wave potential of 1.02 V and 0.89 V versus RHE, respectively, exceeding the performance of the benchmarked Pt/C catalyst in the ORR process with reasonable redox kinetics. Moreover, the material also presents faster kinetics with reasonably low overpotential and excellent electrochemical stability in the OER process as well. This study shows the viability of designing non‐precious high entropy materials as highly efficient oxide electrocatalyst by utilizing its broad compositional space.

Harnessing the inexhaustible solar energy for water splitting is regarded one of the most promising strategies for hydrogen production. However, sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and expensive photovoltaics have hindered commercial viability. Here, an adhesive-free electrodeposition process is developed for in-situ preparation of earth-abundant electrocatalysts on super-flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. NiFe hydroxide exhibited prominent OER performance, achieving an ultra-low overpotential of 236 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline solution. With the superior OER activity, we achieved an unassisted solar water splitting by series connected perovskite solar cells (PSCs) of 2 cm2 aperture area with NiFe/ITO//Pt electrodes, yielding overall solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 13.75 %. Furthermore, we upscaled the monolithic facility to utilize perovskite solar module for large-scale hydrogen production and maintained an approximate operating current of 20 mA. This creative strategy contributes to the decrease of industrial manufacturing expenses for perovskite-based photovoltaic-electrochemical (PV-EC) hydrogen production, further accelerating the conversion and utilization of carbon-free energy.

Abstract Aiming to efficiently expedite alkaline overall water splitting (OWS) by addressing challenges such as sluggish kinetics and limited stability, a hollow Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 ‐NiS@Ni(OH) 2 nanorod array with surface nanosheets is devised, featuring a high‐index Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 (101)‐NiS(211) heterostructural interface and an upshifted d ‐band center. This nanoarchitecture intensifies the adsorption and interaction of H 2 O and OH − reactants on the electrocatalyst surface, suitably bonds the * H intermediate in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and accelerates electron movement of * H, minimizes the energy requirement of the rate‐limiting phase ( * OH → * O) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by facilitating O─H cleavage of * OH and optimally adsorbs * O, amplifies the exposure of surface‐active centers, and ultimately reduces the apparent activation energy. Consequently, the overpotentials are as low as 66.4 mV (HER) and 254.9 mV (OER) at 10 mA cm −2 , alongside high turnover frequencies of 142 s −1 (H 2 ) and 279 s −1 (O 2 ) at 100 and 300 mV, respectively, markedly outperforming direct‐electrodeposited analogues. When functioning as a bifunctional electrode in OWS, this material merely requires 1.57 V at 10 mA cm −2 and sustains an operation for 168 h, approaching Pt/C||RuO 2 benchmark.

Abstract Rapid cost reduction of green hydrogen is essential for the large‐scale deployment of hydrogen‐based energy system. A major component in achieving this is the development of advanced water electrolyzers. Sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck for water electrolysis, and tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop electrocatalysts that accelerate the OER kinetics. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of precious metal‐free OER electrocatalyst capable of stable operation at current densities above 1 A cm 2 . This brings an opportunity of constructing new‐generation electrolyzer with lower cost and higher productivity. However, achieving such high operating current densities presents new challenges. This review summarize the recent progress of high‐performance OER catalysts, and identifies key factors that can be leveraged to enhance catalyst activity. These factors include interface/surface engineering, amorphous and crystal phase coupling, hierarchical structure design, structural reconstruction and phase conversion, high entropy catalyst, and defect engineering. Additionally, the pressing challenges that have been largely ignored in previous research is addressed, such as sustaining long‐term stability under crucial conditions, disadvantages of immobilized powder electrocatalysts, electrode scale design, the necessity of designing innovative electrolyzer cell designs and advance characterization techniques.

The pursuit of carbon‐neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni‐based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine‐rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser‐ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L‐LFP), derived from spent Li‐ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43– species, formed around L‐LFP, effectively repels Cl− ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH– adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high‐performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

The hydrogen production of water electrolysis is a potential technique route of clean energy exchange, but suffering from the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to its four-electron step. In this work, we presented a significant improvement in the OER activity by photothermally triggering P-doped NiFe2O4 (NFO-P) electrocatalyst. As compared to the NiFe2O4 (NFO) catalyst, the excellent PEC performance of robust NFO-P is a result of more readliy generated active sites (Ni(III)), evidencing by the in-situ Raman spectra and polarization curves. With the near-infrared (λ=808 nm) irradiation, the NFO-P surface temperature increases from 37 to 73°C, and the NFO-P delivers a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a pretty low overpotential of 191 mV (10 W/cm2), outperforms most OER catalysts including noble oxides. Photothermal enhancement in OER is attributed to photogenerated hot carriers and thermal activation. The thermal effect accelerates the kinetics, while with the assistance of the hot carrier, the rate-determining step (RDS) transforms from the O* to OOH* formation, reducing the activation energy. This study offers a thorough understanding of the combined contributions of hot carriers and thermal effects to the OER and also opens avenues for enhancing electrochemical efficiency and diminishing techno-economic costs in future applications.

Abstract The inverse problem of reconstructing two space-varying coefficients in a system of one-dimensional (1-d) time-dependent advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equations is considered. The ADR system can be used as a water quality model which describes the evolution of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in a river or stream. The coefficients to be reconstructed represents the effect of the deoxygenation and superficial reaeration processes on the DO and BOD concentration in water. Hölder stability estimates for the coefficients of interest are established using the Carleman estimate technique.

As an energy-sustainable and environmentally friendly technology, electrochemical water splitting is a highly recognized approach for the production of clean energy and overcoming the energy crisis. However, this method faces a series of challenges, such as low catalyst activity, slow kinetics, poor stability, and high cost. Many reports showed that transition metal layered double hydroxides (TM-LDHs) with unique oxygen vacancy (Ov) defects are a significant new type of candidate nanomaterials to replace precious metal catalysts. This is mainly attributed to their unique physicochemical properties, as well as the tuning of the electronic and lattice structure of the catalyst and optimization of the catalyst surface desorption/adsorption reactions achieved through the introduction of oxygen vacancies, thereby accelerating the oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) processes in water splitting. Herein, the preparation methods for engineering oxygen vacancies, and advanced techniques for characterizing oxygen vacancies in catalysts are systematically reviewed, with the aim of clarifying the role of oxygen vacancies in TM-LDHs. The effects of oxygen vacancies on regulating electronic structure, optimizing adsorption energy for intermediates, activating surrounding atomic sites, and generating new active species in TM-LDHs for efficient catalytic HER/OER and decomposition of water are analyzed. More importantly, we discuss the mechanism by which oxygen vacancies promote efficient water splitting in TM-LDHs and outline opportunities and challenges for future development.

A thermal dynamic disaster in the goaf is one of the most serious coal mine disasters formed by coal spontaneous combustion and gas interweaving. However, the influence of the high-temperature hidden fire source formed in the goaf on the evolution law of thermal dynamic disasters is not clear, and effective prevention and control measures cannot be taken. Therefore, this paper uses the experimental platform of thermal dynamic disaster in the goaf to study the influence of different fire point positions on the development of thermal dynamic disaster in the goaf through a similar simulation experiment of thermal dynamic disaster evolution in the goaf and analyzes the corresponding relationship between temperature and CO concentration in the upper corner. The results show that under different locations of heat source, the high-temperature heat source of coal spontaneous combustion migrates to the air leakage side with sufficient oxygen supply, and an oxygen-poor circle is formed near the ignition point. Under the action of air leakage flow, CH4 accumulates in the deep part of the goaf on the return air side. Due to the increase in coal, part of CH4 is produced, which leads to the increase in concentration of CH4 at the ignition point. Under the action of different heat sources, the changing trend of concentration of CO and temperature in the return air corner is the same, but the temperature change in the return air corner shows a lag compared with the change in the concentration of CO, so concentration monitoring of CO can reflect the evolution process of the fire field in the goaf more quickly than temperature monitoring.

Abstract Oxyapatites A 10 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 (A – alkaline, rare‐earth elements) are considered promising materials for applications in solid‐state lighting and non‐contact thermometry. The temperature dynamics of the oxygen sublattice have a crucial influence on the luminescent properties of these optical hosts. Here, the structural evolution with temperature of germanates with the general formula ALa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 (A – Li, Na, K, Rb) is investigated, using X‐ray and neutron powder diffraction methods. These compounds crystallize in space‐group P 6 3 / m . NPD experiments helped to determine the oxygen and alkaline metal positions. Thermally‐induced reentrant structural transitions relating to the oxygen in the apatite channel are discovered for the first time. In the example of Eu‐doped RbLa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 and KLa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 , it is demonstrated that the luminescence of the Eu 3+ ion is influenced by small changes in the crystal structure.

Abstract Catalyzing vanadium redox reactions in VRFBs with transition metal oxides is an effective and affordable approach. In this study, the surface electron distribution of TiO 2 was regulated by introducing oxygen vacancies into its lattice, enabling the electrode to exhibit outstanding catalytic efficacy in VO 2 + /VO 2+ and V 3+ /V 2+ redox transformations and suppress the detrimental side reaction (HER and OER) simultaneously. Benefiting from the enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, the 1000-TiO 2 -GF electrode sustained a stable operation for 100 cycles at 120 mA cm −2 with no discernible efficiency degradation. The DFT results indicate that oxygen vacancy in TiO 2 provides more extra electrons to its neighboring titanium, further strengthening the interaction between the electron-rich titanium and oxygen in VO 2 + /VO 2+ , thus enhancing its catalytic performance. The enhanced catalytic activity for V 3+ /V 2+ on oxygen vacancy-rich TiO 2 coating can be attributed to the effective suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction, which can occupy active sites exclusively and produce detrimental H 2 bubbles. This insight provides valuable guidance for the innovative design of catalysts in vanadium redox flow batteries.

Abstract Lewisite is a representative chemical warfare agent that contains arsenic. Thermal decomposition is an essential method for Lewisite destruction, and appropriate destruction conditions can enhance the environmental friendliness of this method by minimizing the hazards of destruction products. In this study, the variation of Lewisite during pyrolysis and incineration was calculated, with particular emphasis on the evolution behaviors of arsenic and chloride with temperature, pressure, and molar ratio. The main products identified during pyrolysis were HCl(g), C, As, and AsCl 3 (g). Under anoxic conditions, AsCl 3 (g) and As were the dominant species. In oxygen‐enriched conditions, arsenic existed primarily as AsCl 3 (g), As 2 O 5 , As 2 O 4 , and AsOCl. Below 600 °C, arsenic predominantly existed in high valence forms such as As 2 O 5 . Above 600 °C, the binding capacity of chlorine and arsenic was stronger than that of oxygen, resulting in an AsCl 3 (g) molar fraction exceeding 75 % at 1200 °C. The primary chlorides in oxygen‐enriched conditions were Cl 2 (g), HCl(g), AsCl 3 (g), and Cl(g). Lower incineration temperatures (around 500 °C), sufficient oxygen conditions (molar ratio above 4 : 1), and positive pressures were conducive to reducing the toxicity of destruction products. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating neurological and pathological condition that results in significant impairments in motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. By integrating multispectral imaging (MSI) with Raman spectroscopy, a label-free optical methodology was developed for achieving a non-invasive in vivo understanding on the pathological features of SCI evolution. Under the guidance of captured the spectral imaging data cube with a rigid endoscope based MSI system, a special designed fiber probe passed through the instrumental channel for acquiring the finger-print spectral information from compression rat SCI models. After identifying the main visual features of injured spinal cord tissue in all Sham, 0-, 3- and 7-days post injury (0 DPI, 3 DPI, and 7 DPI) groups, the blood volume and oxygen content were visualized to describe hemorrhage, hypoxia and inflammatory state after acute injury. The averaged reflectance spectra, which were deduced from MSI data cubes, were utilized for describing oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration in living tissue. The results of Raman spectroscopy addressed complex compositional and conformational phenomena during SCI progression, correlated with the well-known event like neuronal apoptosis, hemorrhage, demyelination, and even the upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). A principal component analysis and linear discriminate algorithm (PCA-LDA) based discriminate model was introduced for categorizing spectral features in different injury stages, which was applicable for intraoperative interpretations on the complex pathological courses of SCI and therapeutic outcomes.

Abstract This study, placed in the context of the preparation for the Uranus Orbiter Probe mission, aims to predict the bulk volatile compositions of Uranus and Neptune. Using a protoplanetary disk model, it examines the evolution of trace species through vapor and solid transport as dust and pebbles. Due to the high carbon abundance found in their envelopes, the two planets are postulated to have formed at the carbon monoxide ice line within the protosolar nebula. The time evolution of the abundances of the major volatile species at the location of the CO ice line is then calculated to derive the abundance ratios of the corresponding key elements, including the heavy noble gases, in the feeding zones of Uranus and Neptune. Supersolar metallicity in their envelopes likely results from accreting solids in these zones. Two types of solids are considered: pure condensates (Case 1) and a mixture of pure condensates and clathrates (Case 2). The model, calibrated to observed carbon enrichments, predicts deep compositions. In Case 1, argon is deeply depleted, while nitrogen, oxygen, krypton, phosphorus, sulfur, and xenon are significantly enriched relative to their protosolar abundances in the two planets. Case 2 predicts significant enrichments for all species, including argon, relative to their protosolar abundances. Consequently, Case 1 predicts near-zero Ar/Kr or Ar/Xe ratios, while Case 2 suggests that these ratios are 0.1 and 0.5–1 times their protosolar ratios, respectively. Both cases predict a bulk sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio consistent with atmospheric measurements.

Photocatalytic degradation of pollutants coupled with hydrogen (H2) evolution has emerged as a promising solution for environmental and energy crises. However, the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes limits photocatalytic activities. Herein, an S-scheme heterojunction carbon doped-TiO2 /ZnIn2S4 (C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4) was designed by substituting oxygen sites within C-TiO2 by ZnIn2S4. Under visible light irradiation, the optimal C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 exhibits a higher degradation efficiency (88.6%) of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), compared to pristine C-TiO2 (72.9%) and ZnIn2S4 (66.8%). Furthermore, the H2 yield of the C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 reaches 1526.9 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is 3.83 times and 2.87 times that of the C-TiO2 and ZnIn2S4, respectively. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that an internal electric field (IEF) informed in the C-TiO2/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction, accelerates the separation of photogenerated charge pairs, thereby enhancing photocatalytic efficiency of MC-LR degradation and H2 production. This work highlights a new perspective on the development of high-performance photocatalysts for wastewater treatment and H2 generation.

The Eastern Pontides host a diverse suite of plutonic rocks spanning a wide range of ages and compositions. Among these, the Middle Eocene Kazıkbeli pluton, located in the Kürtün district of Gümüşhane, stands out due to its distinctive petrological characteristics. This study aims to unravel the petrological implications of petrographic and mineral chemical data to constrain the physicaydınçakırochemical conditions (temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity) under which the Kazıkbeli magma crystallized and was emplaced. By integrating mineral chemical data, we seek to quantify emplacement pressure, crystallization temperature, and oxygen fugacity. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic relationships and physicochemical properties of the Kazıkbeli pluton rocks, as determined through geological, petrographic and mineral chemistry, is crucial for elucidating the geological evolution of the Eastern Pontides. The Kazıkbeli Pluton exhibits a predominant NE-SW orientation and encompasses an area of roughly 46 km². Modal mineralogical analysis reveals a compositional spectrum ranging from gabbroic diorite to monzogranite, with granodiorite and tonalite being the most prominent rock types. Textural variations encompass fine- to medium-grained, porphyritic, poikilitic, and occasionally graphic textures. The primary mineral assemblage of the pluton comprises plagioclase, orthoclase, quartz, amphibole, biotite, and Fe-Ti oxides. Accessory minerals include zircon, apatite, sphene, and allanite. Plagioclases are labradorite to oligoclase (An26 to An66) in composition. K-feldspar minerals exhibited an orthoclase composition (Or80 to Or97). All amphiboles belong to the calcic amphibole field and exhibit a magnesio-hornblende (Mg#=0.63-0.73) composition. Biotites crystallized as solidified melt products with compositions between annite and phlogopite endmembers, plotting close to the magnesium-rich (Mg#=0.52-0.58) end of the phlogopite solid solution series. Calculated crystallization temperatures derived from amphibole and biotite data range from 712°C to 824°C. Pressure estimations calculated using amphibole-plagioclase, amphibole and biotite suggest a range of 0.04 to 2.06 kbar. Oxygen fugacity (ƒO2) values calculated using amphibole and biotite fall between -12.5 and -16.1. Amphibole-based water content estimations indicate a range of 3.7% to 5.7% for the pluton. Biotite compositions within the studied Kazıkbeli pluton rocks exhibit characteristics suggestive of a potential mantle origin. Geobarometric calculations based on mineral chemistry data with geological and petrographic features indicate the emplacement of the Kazıkbeli Pluton at relatively shallow depths within the crust (~1 to 8 km).

In the metal matrix composites (MMCs) reinforced with nanoparticles, the enhancement of composite performance is often closely associated with the types of nanoparticles. It is vital to explore the influences and differences of various nanoparticles on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of highly alloyed aluminum-based composites. This study is the first to employ hot pressing for preparing Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite materials reinforced with SiC and Al 2 O 3 nano-ceramic particles, respectively. By employing hot extrusion and T6 heat treatment techniques, a systematic investigation was conducted on the effects of the addition of nano-ceramic particles on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composites, and a comparative analysis was performed on the two types of composite materials. The experimental results demonstrated that the Mg atoms in the α-Al matrix were consumed by the addition of SiC/Al 2 O 3 nano-ceramic particles, and thereby the grain size primary η’ (MgZn 2 ) strengthening phase was refined, leading to an enhanced overall mechanical performance of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite. In particular, the Mg 2 Si phase was generated by the addition of SiC nanoceramic particles, through the interfacial reactions, and thus with the synergistic effects of precipitation strengthening and Orowan strengthening, the ultimate compressive strength and compressibility of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu composite can be increased to 844 MPa and 27.5%, respectively. On the other hand, the addition of Al 2 O 3 nanoceramic particles can bring about the formation of an oxygen-rich phase and refined precipitates at grain boundaries. Accordingly, the elongation is increased to 43.5% while a high ultimate compressive strength in the composites can be maintained. It is anticipated that nanoceramic particle-reinforced Al-based metal composites have significant potential for achieving both high strength and exceptional ductility for the application in the industry field.

Superhydrophobic surfaces can seal the gas–liquid interface (GLI) under water to produce the drag reduction effect. Enhancing the stability and slip length of the GLI is an important issue in this context. Herein, we fabricate wettability step electrodes (WSEs) by creating an array of millimeter-scale circular superhydrophobic regions on a hydrophilic graphite plate by using an economical and efficient mask spraying method. When the WSE was electrified as an anode, the oxygen produced by the electrolytic reaction was preferentially precipitated in the superhydrophobic regions and ultimately formed an array of millimeter-scale GLIs. The evolution process of this GLI can be divided into a spreading stage and a growth stage. The results of experiments revealed that the spreading duration of the GLI increased with the diameter of the superhydrophobic regions (D) and decreased with the spacing between adjacent superhydrophobic regions (L). During the growth stage, the height of the GLI decreased with the ratio D/(L + D) and increased over the duration of electrification according to a 1/3 power-law relationship. Finally, we measured the slip characteristic on a single millimeter-scale GLI by particle image velocimetry. The result showed that the effective slip length of the GLI with a streamwise length of 2 mm can exceed 100 μm, thus confirming the potential of the millimeter-scale GLI for drag reduction.

Converting CO2 to carbon‐based fuels using solar energy via photocatalysis is a promising approach to boost carbon neutrality. However, the solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency is hampered by interconnected multiple factors including insufficient light absorption, low separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers as well as complex and sluggish surface reaction kinetics. Herein, we incorporate MnO2 nanowires and Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons with abundant oxygen vacancies (Vo) into MnO2/Co3O4 sugar‐gourd nanohybrids for boosting CO2 photoreduction. The MnO2/Co3O4 nanohybrids not only display strong absorption in the visible–near infrared region, but also facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers in terms of S‐scheme transfer pathway, supplying abundant electrons for CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, the presence of VO enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and promotes the chemical adsorption to CO2 molecules. In addition, the interfacial electronic interaction between MnO2 and Co3O4 also contributes to the chemical adsorption and activation to CO2. Owing to the synergy of S‐scheme transfer pathway and VO, the MnO2/Co3O4 hybrids exhibit greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction under the irradiation of visible light in comparison with bare MnO2 and Co3O4, delivering a CO evolution rate of 15.9 umol g−1 h−1 with a 100% selectivity.

Abstract Defect engineering is an effective strategy to enhance the enzyme‐like activity of nanozymes. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on introducing defects via de novo synthesis and post‐synthetic treatment, overlooking the dynamic evolution of defects during the catalytic process involving highly reactive oxygen species. Herein, a defect‐engineered metal–organic framework (MOF) nanozyme with mixed linkers is reported. Over twofold peroxidase (POD)‐like activity enhancement compared with unmodified nanozyme highlights the critical role of in situ defect formation in enhancing the catalytic performance of nanozyme. Experimental results reveal that highly active hydroxyl radical (•OH) generated in the catalytic process etches the 2,5‐dihydroxyterephthalic acid ligands, contributing to electronic structure modulation of metal sites and enlarged pore sizes in the framework. The self‐enhanced POD‐like activity induced by in situ defect engineering promotes the generation of •OH, holding promise in colorimetric sensing for detecting dichlorvos. Utilizing smartphone photography for RGB value extraction, the resultant sensing platform achieves the detection for dichlorvos ranging from 5 to 300 ng mL −1 with a low detection limit of 2.06 ng mL −1 . This pioneering work in creating in situ defects in MOFs to improve catalytic activity offers a novel perspective on traditional defect engineering.

Abstract Excited by intense infrared ultrafast light pulses, a wide bandgap material undergoes nonlinear ionization, generating a high density of free electrons in conduction states. As a result, the electronic band structure is critically modified and the bandgap shrinks. This induces rapid changes in optical properties, dramatically affecting the absorption spectrum during light coupling to the dielectric surface or during nonlinear propagation inside the bulk. This study analyzes the structural behavior and the modification of the optical properties of laser‐excited silica glass at the molecular cluster level through first‐principles simulations. Employing density functional theory and the GW approximations for band structure under nonequilibrium conditions, alongside the Bethe–Salpeter equation, the dynamics of the optical properties of fused silica are comprehensively explored. The behavior of excited fused silica in a wide photon energy range (from a few to 20 eV) is thus predicted. Laser‐induced electron excitation triggers a redistribution of charges between oxygen and silicon atoms, accompanied by a significant increase in electronic pressure, local atomic structure rearrangement, and material expansion. Molecular dynamics simulations offer a temporal perspective on the excited state dynamics, unveiling the intricate interplay between electronic and atomic effects on bandgap evolution. The analysis sheds light on excitonic resonances, intraband and interband transitions in fused silica under ultrafast laser irradiation, providing valuable insights into its excited state behavior and optical properties.

Abstract We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of ∼20 au that straddles the L–T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with on-axis host star spectra, which provides self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 ± 3 km s −1 and carbon monoxide and water mass fractions of logCO = −2.3 ± 0.3 and logH 2 O = −2.7 ± 0.2, respectively. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 ± 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 ± 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L–T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high v sin i and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures to which we are sensitive. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation to the breakup velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of >200 very low-mass objects ( M ≲ 0.1 M ⊙ ) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated low-mass field objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.

Two cool-season putting green turfgrass species, annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass, are differential in ice encasement tolerance. Physiological mechanisms associated with creeping bentgrass ice encasement tolerance and annual bluegrass susceptibility are not understood. The objectives were to evaluate oxygen, ethylene, and CO 2 content within the upper soil space of the plants while frozen and immediately after ice melt after 0, 5, 10, 20, and 28 days of ice encasement (2.54 cm of ice) in growth chamber conditions. Following ice melt, plant samples were separated into leaf, crown, and root tissues and used to evaluate carbohydrate and amino acid content. Annual bluegrass exhibited higher damage (slower recovery rates) on most sampling days compared with creeping bentgrass. The organs that were most damaged and exhibited a differential principal component analysis snapshot, were the leaf and crown tissues. Creeping bentgrass may preserve leaf and crown tissues for postwinter recovery whereas significant metabolic changes occur in annual bluegrass leaves and crowns. Creeping bentgrass retained total amino acids in leaves following ice encasement whereas total leaf amino acid levels declined in annual bluegrass. Specific carbohydrates and amino acids such as the ability to maintain high levels of fructose, asparagine, and proline may be important indicators of the tolerance to ice encasement stress. On the basis of more prominent carbohydrate and amino acid loss in leaves and crowns and higher levels of CO 2 evolution, annual bluegrass may exhibit a higher metabolism and/or tissue damage during ice encasement compared with creeping bentgrass, which could reduce spring recuperative potential.

Ultralow pressure filtration system, which integrates the dual functionalities of biofilm degradation and membrane filtration, has gained significant attention in water treatment due to its superior contaminant removal efficiency. However, it is a challenge to mitigate membrane biofouling while maintaining the high activity of biofilm. This study presents a novel ceramic-based ultrafiltration membrane functionalized with tourmaline nanoparticles to address this challenge. The incorporation of tourmaline nanoparticles enables the release of nutrient elements and the generation of an electric field, which enhances the biofilm activity on the membrane surface and simultaneously alleviates intrapore biofouling. The tourmaline-modified ceramic membrane (TCM) demonstrated a significant antifouling effect, with a substantial increase in water flux by 60%. Additionally, the TCM achieved high removal efficiencies for contaminants (48.78% in TOC, 22.28% in UV254, and 24.42% in TN) after 30 days of continuous operation. The fouling resistance by various constituents in natural water was individually analyzed using model compounds. The TCM with improved electronegativity and hydrophilicity exhibited superior resistance to irreversible fouling through increased electrostatic repulsion and reduced adhesion to foulants. Comprehensive characterizations and analyses, including interfacial interaction energies, redox reaction processes, and biofilm evolutions, demonstrated that the TCM can release nutrient elements to facilitate the development of functional microbial community within the biofilm, and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the membrane surface to the degrade contaminants and mitigate membrane biofouling. The electric field generated by tourmaline nanoparticles can promote electron transfer in the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle, ensuring a stable and sustainable generation of ROS and bactericidal negative ions. These synergistic functions enhance contaminant removal and reduce irreversible fouling of the TCM. This study provides fundamental insights into the role of tourmaline-modified surfaces in enhancing membrane filtration performance and fouling resistance, inspiring the development of high-performance, anti-fouling membranes.
