Regulating the spintronic structure of electrocatalysts can improve the oxygen evolution reaction performance efficiently. Nonetheless, the effects of tuning the spintronic structure for the oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms have rarely been discussed. Here, we show a ruthenium-cobalt-tin oxide with optimized spintronic structure due to the quantum spin interaction of Ru and Co. The specific spintronic structure of ruthenium-cobalt-tin oxide promotes the charge transfer kinetics and intermediates evolution behavior under applied potential, generating long-lived active species with higher spin density sites for the oxygen evolution reaction after the reconstruction process. Moreover, the ruthenium-cobalt-tin oxide possesses decoupled proton-electron transfer procedure during the oxygen evolution reaction process, demonstrating that the electron transfer procedure of O-O bond formation between *O intermediate and lattice oxygen in Co-O-Ru is the rate-determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction process. This work provides rational perspectives on the correlation between spintronic structure and oxygen evolution reaction mechanism. Tuning the spintronic structure in oxygen evolution reactions is underexplored, despite its potential to enhance catalytic performance. Here, the authors report a ruthenium-cobalt-tin oxide with an optimized spintronic structure, highlighting its improved performance and reaction mechanisms.

Since carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased at unprecedented rate over the last ten years, global warming has become an increasingly pressing concern for humanity. This work suggests a sustainable solution to this issue by employing a unique mechanism that uses sunlight and electricity to transform CO2 into useful fuel. To construct the device, a Simulink model of the electrochemical reduction cell was created. The model essentially transforms photovoltaic power, CO2 and water into other chemical products. Using the reversible, activation and ohmic equations, the voltage needed to run the CO2 reduction cell was determined. As the anode, cathode, and voltage source blocks are the three main models that make up the CO2 electrolyser cell, the production flow rates of formic acid and oxygen were also evaluated based on molar and charge balances, as well as continuity equations at operating conditions of 1 atm and 298 K. The simulation predicts about 176 kg of CO2 consumption in 10 seconds of the electrochemical conversion. Therefore, the implication of this study is to justify photosynthesis as electrochemical reduction process to efficiently mitigate the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibits a sluggish four‐electron transfer process, necessitating catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity to enhance its kinetic rate. Van der Waals layered oxides are ideal materials for catalyst design, yet its stability for acidic OER remains large obstacle. Doping provides a crucial way to improve the activity and stability simultaneously. However, doping in Van der Waals layered oxides remains a great challenge since it easily leads to lattice distortion or even the crystal structure damage. In this work, we successfully doping acid‐resistant niobium (Nb) into Van der Waals layered edge‐shared 1T phase iridium oxide (1T‐IrO2) via alkali‐assisted thermal method. 1T‐IrO2 with a 5% Nb doping (Nb0.05Ir0.95O2) only required an overpotential of 191 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 56 mV lower than that of 1T‐IrO2. When applied in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Nb0.05Ir0.95O2 achieved a current density of 1.2 A cm‐2 at a cell voltage of 1.7 V for 50 days. Density functional theory calculation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential‐determining step from the *OOH deprotonation process in 1T‐IrO2 to the *O‐OH coupling process in Nb0.05Ir0.95O2.

Abstract Mn‐based layered oxides have garnered significant attention as cathode materials for energy storage due to their environmental benignity and high theoretical specific capacity. However, practical applications remain constrained by sluggish Na + intercalation kinetics and poor structural stability. In this study, it is engineered that the Mn‐O‐B unit through an oxygen edge‐sharing strategy to modulate Mn─O covalency in P2‐type Na 0.67 MnO 2 , thereby achieving high specific capacity and structural stability. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that increased TM‐O covalency facilitates Na + diffusion in P2‐type Na 0.67 MnO 2 while simultaneously enhancing air stability. The as‐prepared P2‐type Na 0.67 MnB 0.05 O 2 exhibits a specific capacitance of 452 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 , maintaining 96.75% capacity retention after 8800 cycles. This work elucidates the critical role of oxygen edge‐sharing in optimizing interactions between transition metal and oxygen atoms, establishing a relationship between Mn─O structure and functional properties. These findings advance the development of high‐performance energy storage technologies.

Abstract Herein, multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) embedded with RuPdIrPtAu‐high entropy alloys (HEA) via pulsed laser irradiation in liquids are successfully fabricated. The resultant composite synergistically enhances hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR)‐boosted water electrolysis. Notably, HEA with ≈2–5 nm size, are uniformly distributed across the surface of the CNTs. An optimized HEA/CNT‐10 demonstrates exceptional performance in oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER), depicted by ultralow overpotentials of 30.7 and 330 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , respectively. By replacing OER with HzOR, HEA/CNT‐10 needs a lower potential of 0.1 V to accomplish 10 mA cm −2 , as compared to OER (1.56 V vs. RHE). Moreover, the hydrazine splitting electrolyzer desirable a small voltage of 0.242 V to attain 10 mA cm −2 , while maintaining exceptional stability. Experimental and DFT studies validate the cocktail effects and role of multiple metal‐sites in HEA/CNT‐10, which significantly enhance the efficiency of parallel HER||HzOR processes, highlighting its potential in energy‐efficient, hydrogen production. In situ Raman probe indicated the configuration of an acidic environment, monitoring of H 3 O + , during HER, despite the basic conditions. This is attributed to the dominance of the Heyrovsky step, facilitated by the high catalytic activity of the HEA, coupled with protonation of the CNT surface.

ABSTRACT In this study, we present the synthesis and characterization of a high‐performance Zn 3 (PO 4 ) 2 ·4H₂O/TiO 2 nanocomposite, designed as a versatile electrocatalyst for advanced energy storage and conversion applications. The synthesis of the Zn 3 (PO 4 ) 2 ·4H₂O/TiO 2 nanocomposite was confirmed using various sophisticated analytical techniques such as powder x‐ray diffraction, FTIR, UV spectroscopy, FESEM imaging, EDX, and XPS etc. Notably, the nanocomposite demonstrates exceptional performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a low overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 50 mV/cm 2 and a Tafel slope of 129 mV/dec, indicating superior kinetics. Furthermore, it demonstrates a specific capacitance of 112 F/g at a scan rate of 20 mV/s and remarkable cyclic stability, retaining 91% capacitance over 1000 cycles in supercapacitor applications. Additionally, in a practical application, the nanocomposite successfully powered a red light‐emitting diode (LED) for 11 min. The combined effect of Zn 3 (PO 4 ) 2 ·4H₂O 2 and TiO 2 contributes to its outstanding electrochemical properties. This makes it a promising candidate for sustainable energy solutions, with the potential to enhance the efficiency and durability of energy storage and conversion systems.

Abstract The dual‐site electrocatalysts formed by metal single atoms combines with metal nanoparticles represent a promising strategy to enhance both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Herein, defect engineering is applied to dual‐site ORR and OER electrocatalysts. Its design, synthesis, structural properties, and catalytic performance experimentally and theoretically are insightfully studied for the single‐atomic Fe─N 4 and the adjacent Fe 7 Co 3 nanoalloy (FeCo NA ) as dual‐site loading on nitrogen‐doped graphene aerogel (Fe─N/FeCo@NGA). The high‐density dual‐sites, together with the good electronic conductivity of NGA, synergistically improve the electronic structure for superior electrocatalytic activity. The half‐wave potential of Fe─N/FeCo@NGA in ORR is 0.92 V and the overpotential of it in OER is 1.58 V. Corresponding all‐solid‐state Zn‐air battery demonstrates a peak power density of 147.6 mW cm −2 and charge/discharge durability for over 140 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that the single‐atomic Fe‐N 4 and FeCo NA dual‐site on the skeleton defect optimized NGA, further refine the local electronic structure, modulating the tensile force on the O─O bond in * OOH intermediate, leading to its spontaneous dissociation and facilitating a significantly reduced energy barrier. This work takes a promising shortcut in the application of defect engineering for the development of highly efficient dual‐site bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with single atoms.

Abstract The sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis necessitates applied bias to facilitate electron transfer as well as bond cleavage and formation. Traditional electrocatalysis focuses on analyzing the effects of electron transfer, while the role of charge accumulation induced by the applied overpotential has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence mechanism of bias‐driven charge accumulation, capacitive Mn is incorporated into IrO 2 to regulate the local electronic structure and the adsorption behavior. The applied bias triggers dynamic redox reactions at the active sites, which introduce local charge accumulation on the surface of electrocatalyst. Under bias, Mn oxidation induced a noticeable pseudocapacitance in the pre‐OER region, promoting the OER kinetics of iridium sites. Meanwhile, the increased oxygen vacancy formation energy further prevents the lattice oxygen activation. The PEM electrolyzer, equipped with optimal materials as an anode, operates at a low driving voltage of 1.637 V under 2.0 A cm −2 , maintaining stable performance for over 800 h with a low degradation rate (19.4 µV h −1 ). This work provides insights into the performance of metal oxide catalysts in acidic environments and offers forward‐looking strategies for enhancing the catalytic performance through dynamic redox induced capacitive behavior.

Abstract Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exfoliated from bulk layered materials possess interesting properties. Most transition metal oxides are not layered and therefore cannot be exfoliated. Here we report the synthesis of a family of ultrathin materials—transition metal oxychalcogenides (TMOCs)—and demonstrate their unique properties. Two-dimensional TMOCs (MX x O y , M = group IV or V transition metal, X = chalcogen, O = oxygen; x , y = 0–2) from bulk transition metal dichalcogenides (MX 2 ) have been fabricated using tetrabutylammonium intercalation. The stoichiometry of TMOCs can be adjusted, which enables control of their optical bandgaps and tunability of electrical conductivity by more than eight orders of magnitude. By tuning the chalcogen-to-oxygen ratio along with local atomic structure in TMOCs, it is possible to impart unexpected properties. For example, in contrast to conventional TMDs, the hybrid structure of TMOCs renders them surprisingly stable and electrochemically active in strong acids, allowing them to be used as proof-of-concept catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction at pH ≈ 0. The HfS 0.52 O 1.09 catalyst shows high mass activity (103,000 A g −1 at an overpotential of 0.5 V) and exhibits durability in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers.

The production, conversion and storage of energy based on electrocatalysis, mainly assisted by oxygen evolution reaction (OER), plays a crucial role in alkaline water electrolyzers (AWEs) and fuel cells. Nevertheless, the insufficient availability of highly efficient catalyst materials at a reasonable cost that overcome the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of the OER is one of the significant obstacles. Herein, we report a fast and facile synthesis of vapor phase deposition of dual-phase nickel sulfide (Ni-sulfide) using low-temperature annealing in the presence of H2S and demonstrated as an efficient catalyst for OER to address the issues with sluggish electrochemical kinetics. The dual-phase Ni-sulfide structures consist of densely packed 10–50 μm microcrystals with 40–50 individual dual-phase layers, such as NiS and Ni7S6. As an electrocatalyst, the dual-phase Ni-sulfide exhibits excellent OER activity by achieving a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential (η10) of 0.29 V and excellent electrochemical stability over 50 h. Besides, the Ni-sulfide displays considerable electrochemical robustness in alkaline conditions and forms OER-active Ni-oxide/hydroxide species during the process. Using an energy-efficient synthesis method, the fabricated unique crystalline nanodesign of dual-phase Ni-sulfide could open new pathways for the controlled synthesis of a high-efficiency group of electrocatalysts for a long-time stable electrochemical catalytic activity.

Using metal oxides to disperse iridium (Ir) in the anode layer proves effective for lowering Ir loading in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). However, the reported low-Ir-based catalysts still suffer from unsatisfying electrolytic efficiency and durability under practical industrial working conditions, mainly due to insufficient catalytic activity and mass transport in the catalyst layer. Herein we report a class of porous heterogeneous nanosheet catalyst with abundant Ir-O-Mn bonds, achieving a notable mass activity of 4 A mgIr−1 for oxygen evolution reaction at an overpotential of 300 mV, which is 150.6 times higher than that of commercial IrO2. Ir-O-Mn bonds are unraveled to serve as efficient charge-transfer channels between in-situ electrochemically-formed IrOx clusters and MnOx matrix, fostering the generation and stabilization of highly active Ir3+ species. Notably, Ir/MnOx-based PEMWE demonstrates comparable performance under 10-fold lower Ir loading (0.2 mgIr cm−2), taking a low cell voltage of 1.63 V to deliver 1 A cm−2 for over 300 h, which positions it among the elite of low Ir-based PEMWEs. Building an efficient proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzer with low Ir loading remains important but challenging. Here, the authors report an Ir/MnOx catalyst with rich Ir-O-Mn bonds that serve as charge-transfer channels to generate and stabilize active Ir3+ species, enhancing both activity and stability.

Water splitting is a promising approach to producing eco-friendly and high-energy-density hydrogen, addressing both energy shortages and environmental challenges. However, the development of efficient non-noble electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains challenging due to the sluggish kinetics of four sequential proton-coupled electron transfer steps. In this study, nickel-cobalt-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets on nickel foam (NiCoFe@LDH/NF) are synthesized via a straightforward one-step solvothermal method. Unlike traditional Co doping, our work found that the proper introduction of Co could improve the lattice tolerance and inhibit the formation of Ni-rich or Fe-rich phase simultaneously. Both experimental and theoretical data collaboratively demonstrated that the proper incorporation of cobalt in NiFe-LDH optimized its electronic structure and tuned the Gibbs free energy of oxygen intermediates (*O) to an optimal value (~2.5 eV). This reduced the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, resulting in enhanced active site utilization and improved catalytic efficiency at the interface between LDH materials and water. Consequently, NiCoFe@LDH/NF exhibited excellent OER activity, with overpotentials of 149 and 246 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−1 in 1 mol∙L−1 KOH, surpassing noble metal-based catalysts like RuO2. In addition, the synthesis process was completed within four hours, enabling its potential for industrial-scale production. This work provides a novel strategy for optimizing catalytic activity of LDH interface through adjusting the O adsorption behavior on Fe sites, lays the foundation for LDH catalyst development with outstanding activity.

Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), a predominant technology for large-scale industrial hydrogen production, faces limitations in commercialization owing to the inadequate catalytic activity and stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. This study introduces a NiFeAl self-supported electrode characterized by high activity and stability for the OER and outlines a rational design strategy for NiFe (oxy)hydroxide-based self-supported electrodes. The introduction of Al, a ternary dopant with relatively low electronegativity and a small ionic radius, into the NiFe electrode effectively controls the adsorption energy of O-intermediates and facilitates the deprotonation of adsorbed OH*, thereby accelerating the OER. Remarkably, the NiFeAl self-supported electrode demonstrates approximately 50% enhanced operational activity (0.71 A cm–2 at 1.8 V) compared to NiFe alongside exceptional stability (>72 h at 0.6 A cm–2) in OER within an AWE single cell. These findings highlight the significant potential of the NiFeAl electrode for application in AWE for efficient, large-scale hydrogen production.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal process for sustainable hydrogen energy production, relying on efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, particularly in acidic environments, where both high activity and durability are crucial. Despite the favorable kinetics of platinum (Pt)‐based materials, their performance is hindered under harsh conditions, driving the search for alternatives. Due to their unique structural characteristic, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) emerge as attractive candidates for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts. However, modulating their properties and functionalities is crucial to overcome their conductivity issue. Herein, a reconfiguration strategy for the dual‐driven surface restructuring of the CoFe PBA involving graphene quantum dots (GQD) and UV/ozone is proposed. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis revealed that dual‐driven reconstruction plays a pivotal role in promoting the high‐valence metal ions, effectively reducing charge transfer resistance—a key limitation in HER. The optimized CoFe PBA/GQD‐UV exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance toward HER, with a low overpotential of 77 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm −2 with excellent durability for 12 h under an extremely high current density of 500 mA cm −2 in an acidic solution. This dual‐combination strategy offering a new pathway to develop highly active electrocatalysts.

This work aims to deal with the challenges associated with designing complementary bifunctional electrocatalysts and a separator/membrane that enables rechargeable zinc–air batteries (RZABs) with nearly solid-state operability. This solid-state RZAB was accomplished by integrating a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on Ru-RuO2 interface nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene (Ru-RuO2/NGr) and a dual-doped poly(acrylic acid) hydrogel (d-PAA) electrolyte soaked in KOH with sodium stannate additive. The catalyst shows enhanced activity and stability toward the two oxygen reactions, i.e., oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), with a very low potential difference (ΔE) of 0.64 V. The computational insights bring out the electronic factors contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity of Ru-RuO2/NGr based on the charge density difference (CDD) between the interfaces. The disadvantages of the existing solid-state RZABs, such as their limited lifespan brought on by passivation, dendritic growth, corrosion, and shape change, have also been taken into account. The introduction of the stannate additive to the electrolyte induced an in situ Zn-anode modification, which subsequently improved the interfacial stability of the ZABs and, hence, the battery life cycles. The experimental observations reveal that, during the charging process, the Sn nanoparticles enable the homogeneous Zn deposition on the surface of the anode. Thus, the in situ Zn-anode surface modification assisted in achieving a high-rate cycle capability, viz., the homemade catalyst-based system exhibited continuous charge–discharge cycles for 20 h at a current density of 2.0 mA cm–2, with each cycle lasting for 5 min.

Alkaline water electrolysis is one of most potential techniques for green hydrogen production, offering high energy conversion and storage. High current density and durability diaphragms are crucial for electrochemical performance. Here we have developed a high-performance composite diaphragm based on in-situ self-assemble of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) loaded on Zirfon-type substrate, and at the same time catalytic NiFe-LDHs integrated the anode side for high-performance alkaline water electrolysis. By modulating the microstructure, a unique surficial feature with high surface free energy and super-hydrophilicity to address the issue of high ohmic resistance is established and achieves rapid OH−conduction and high catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Consequently, the prepared ZLDH-χ series diaphragm affords excellent application properties, with ZLDH-10 diaphragm an ultra-short wetting time of 0.23s and a reduction of 120 mV over-voltage in single electrolytic cell. Electrolyzer with ZLDH-10 diaphragm provides exceptional current density of 1400 mA cm-2 at 2.0 V in 80oC 30wt% KOH. Importantly, large-scale ZLDH-10 diaphragm with 37 × 37 cm2 can be readily made and reaches an unprecedented durability at 1000 mA cm-2@1.8 V over 240 hours. Both simple in-situ self-assemble approach and excellent performance of ZLDH-χ series diaphragm pave a new way for manufacturing diaphragm in advanced alkaline water electrolysis. A partial polarization method was first invented to figure out the contribution ratio for cell voltage reduction between NiFe-LDHs catalytic effect and hydrophilic improving effect.

Constructing fast electron transfer pathways and abundant electro-active sites is an effective strategy to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of catalysts. Herein, structural engineering and dual-phase engineering were employed to construct a NiS2 nanoparticle-encapsulated MOF configured with a pseudo-neuronal structure (NiS2/MOF/HT). It was found that the pseudo-neuronal structure, constructed with a carbon nanohorn (CNH) and carbon nanotube (CNT), provided fast electron transfer pathways and abundant exposed active sites. Moreover, the NiS2/MOF/HT composite obtained via partial vulcanization not only inherited the pseudo-neuronal structure but also prevented the aggregation and growth of NiS2 particles. NiS2/MOF composites provide various active sites. With the combination of the promotion of electronic transfer and enrichment of electro-active sites (NiS2, MOF), NiS2/MOF/HT showed excellent performance, whose overpotential at 25 mA cm−2 was reduced by 19.5% compared with MOF/HT.

Perovskites exhibit catalytic properties on the oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis. Elemental doping by specific preparation methods is a good strategy to obtain highly catalytical active perovskite catalysts. In this work, La0.5Sr0.5Co1-xNixO3-δ perovskite materials doped with different ratios of nickel were successfully synthesized by the sol-gel method. The electrochemical measurement results show that in 1 M KOH solution, La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ prepared by the sol-gel method requires only a low overpotential of 213 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2, which is significantly lower than that of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ prepared by the hydrothermal method for the increasing about 45.24 % (389 @ 10 mA cm-2). In addition, La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ by the sol-gel method can be kept stable in alkaline medium tested for 30 h without degradation. This indicates that the prepared La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ has better OER performance. The SEM results shows that layer structured La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ by the sol-gel method has more surface pores with a pore diameter of about 0.362 μm than spherical granular structured La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ by the hydrothermal method. XPS results reveal that the crystal lattice of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ by nickel doping is lengthened and the electronic configuration of Co also is changed by the sol-gel preparation process. The improved electrocatalytic performance of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ may be attributed to the pore structure formed with providing more active sites during the sol-gel process and the improved oxygen mobility with Ni doping by the sol-gel method. The doping strategy by the sol-gel method provides valuable insights for optimizing perovskite catalytic properties.

The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a rapid control step in water splitting for hydrogen production can utilise FeNi-based catalysts to reduce the reaction overpotential. In considering the disparate effects of crystalline and amorphous phases on the stability and activity of the catalyst, amorphous/crystalline heterojunctions were formed by FeNi-based metal oxides and employed as catalysts. In this work, the amorphous NiFeOx-modified Ni3S2-NiO/NF* heterojunction nanosheets (NiFe@Ni3S2-NiO/NF*) with a three-dimensional structural configuration were successfully prepared through a two-stage process involving hydrothermal and electrical treatments. In NiFe@Ni3S2-NiO/NF*, the electrically activated Ni3S2-NiO/NF* in-stiu nanosheets exhibit a stable crystal structure and regular morphology, which enhances catalytic stability and facilitates exposure of active sites. Meanwhile, amorphous nickel-iron oxides modified by electrodeposition methods exhibit a robust bond with the substrate, coupled with structural flexibility, low contact resistance and high electrocatalytic activity. The NiFe@Ni3S2-NiO/NF* electrode exhibits remarkable catalytic activity towards OER in alkaline media, particularly at low potential of 1.49 V to reach large current density of 50 mA cm-2, along with excellent long-term stability. These findings are of significant importance in providing novel insights for the design and construction of FeNi-based metal oxide catalysts.

Hydrogen energy has the potential to mitigate the adverse environmental effects of fossil fuels and address the growing need for energy. Water electrolysis is an environmentally friendly process of hydrogen production compared to the more widely used steam methane reforming. Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is a type of electrolysis that combines the advantages of both alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) and proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), operating in an alkaline solution and zero-gap configuration, respectively. During the reaction of water splitting, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) determines the reaction kinetics. In this study, we developed Ni/Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH), a cost-effective catalyst for AEMWE. Optimum operating conditions, such as temperature, membrane pretreatment, catalyst loadings, and GDL characteristics, are evaluated through polarization testing and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Results show that membrane pretreatments with KOH and NaCl have similar effects with an optimum 1-hour immersion. A cathode gas diffusion layer with a hydrophobic surface for efficient bubble removal and hydrophilic internal properties for effective electrolyte exchange offered an increase in current density of 68.4% at 2 V. Pt loading of 1.0 mg cm−2 with ultrasonic spraying is the most favorable, and increasing the temperature from 25 to 60 °C also increases the current density from 200 mA cm−2 to 600 mAcm−2 at 1.8 V.

Continuous tungsten trioxide (WO3) and porous titanium dioxide (TiO2) films on AISI304 type steel were prepared by electrochemical methods. The morphology and structure of the obtained films were studied by X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Oxygen evolution catalyst containing cobalt–phosphate compound was deposited photochemically onto the surface of semiconductor particles. The photoelectrochemical properties of the prepared electrodes were investigated in neutral 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions. The voltammetric characteristics revealed that the presence of cobalt-based catalyst effectively changes the photoelectrocatalytic activity of WO3 and TiO2 particles. The influence of some synthesis parameters (type of cobalt(II) salt, photodeposition time) on the electrochemical properties of the prepared electrodes was evaluated experimentally.

Abstract Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) is a conventional anode material for solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) to catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the inferior chemical stability of BSCF results in severe surface segregation and performance degradation under high temperatures. A critical challenge lies in alleviating surface segregation and preserving the high OER performance of BSCF anode. Herein, lanthanides are introduced to substitute Ba of BSCF, labeled as Ln0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (LnSCF, Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm), to regulate its stability and performance. The introduction of La and Pr effectively enhances stability, suppresses surface segregation, and maintains high OER activity. The continuous lattice oxygen loss and Co ions oxidation of LnSCF are demonstrated upon annealing in oxidizing atmosphere, thus we propose that surface segregation is a self-regulation mechanism of perovskite lattice to tolerant oxidizing atmosphere and maintain structurally stable via decreasing A-site valence state and forming surface segregation. SOEC with La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (LSCF) anode delivers the optimal current density of 1.69 A cm-2 at1.6 V and stability for CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C, shedding light on designing advanced catalysts for high-temperature OER.&#xD;

Abstract Hydrogen spillover‐based binary (HSBB) system has attracted significant attention in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Accelerating hydrogen spillover in the HSBB system is crucial for the HER activity. Herein, a highly efficient HSBB system is developed by anchoring nano‐Ru on oxygen vacancy (Vo) rich amorphous/crystal ZrO 2 . Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the water molecules dissociate on the Vo of ZrO 2 into protons, which then couple with electrons to form H * , and the produced H * are spilled over to the nano‐Ru to evolve H 2 . The amorphous regions enhance the adsorption and desorption rates of hydrogen while exposing a greater number of active sites; meanwhile, the Vo significantly reduce the work function of ZrO 2 , facilitates electron transfer from ZrO 2 to Ru, and thereby accelerates hydrogen spillover. As a result, the Ru/ac‐ZrO 2 delivers a low overpotential of 14 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a high mass activity of 46.47 A mg metal −2 at 300 mV for alkaline HER, bypass those of commercial Pt/C (19 mV and 0.09 A mg metal −2 , respectively).

Heterogenous single-atom catalysts (SACs) are reminescent of homogenous catalysts because of similarity of structural motif of active sites, showing the potential of using the advantage of homogenous catalysts to tackle challenges in hetereogenous catalysis. In heterogeneous oxygen electrocatalysis, the homogeneity of adsorption patterns of reaction intermediates leads to scaling relationships that limit their activities. In contrast, homogeneous catalysts can circumvent such limits by selectively altering the adsorption of intermediates through secondary coordination effects (SCE). This inspired us to explored potential SCE in metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C), a promising type of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. We introduced SCE with a neighboring metal site, which can modulate the adsorption strengths of oxygen-containing intermediates. First-principles calculations show that the second site in heteronuclear duo four-nitrogen-coordinated metal-center can induce SCE that selectively stabilize the OOH intermediate, but with minor effects on the OH intermediate, and thereby, disrupt scaling relation between oxygen-species, and eventually increase the catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reactions. Additionally, the activity of oxygen reduction reaction of selected M-N-C is also enhanced by such SCE. Our computational work underscored the critical role SCE can have in shaping activities of SACs, particularly in altering scaling relationships favorably, and demonstrated its potential of addressing catalytic challenges in heterogeneous catalysis.

ABSTRACT Electrocatalysis plays a central role in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, providing a number of sustainable processes for future technologies. As a green, renewable, and abundant natural polymer material, the unique structure and physicochemical properties of wood and its derivatives provide a unique application advantage in the field of electrocatalysis, which has aroused intense attention from researchers. At present, researchers have developed many wood‐based catalytic electrodes by taking advantage of the anisotropic hierarchical porous structure of wood and abundant active functional groups on the cell wall surface of wood. Here, a comprehensive review of recent progress in the design and synthesis of wood‐inspired electrodes for electrocatalytic reactions is summarized. Starting from the role and importance of the electrocatalytic process in the whole energy conversion system, this review highlights the composition and structure of wood, analyzes the mechanisms of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and discusses the structure‐activity relationship between the structural properties and electrochemical activity of wood‐inspired electrodes. Finally, the opportunities, challenges, and future directions in the application of wood and its derivatives in the field of electrocatalysis are prospected.

The development of efficient and low-cost overall water splitting electrocatalysts for an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer is desirable for hydrogen production. The control of geometrical and electronical structure of electrocatalysts can improve the catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and durability in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Spacially confined growth and heteroatom doping can achieve this prospection of the target electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepared a carbon-shell confined Mo-doped CoP electrocatalyst (Mo-CoP@C) via anion adsorption coupled pyrolytic phosphorization method. A Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) of Co was used to achieve Mo6+ doping and carbon-shell-confined-growth. Mo ion doping significantly altered the electronic structure of CoP, which produced a local polarized environment for water dissociation during alkali HER process. Meanwhile, the carbon framework confined the growth of Mo-CoP and provide protective layer to durable OER process. Consequently, Mo-CoP@C exhibits attractive alkaline electrocatalytic HER and OER activities with the overpotentials of 122 and 280 mV at 0.01 A cm-2. Finally, the assembled Mo-CoP@C-CP‖Mo-CoP@C-TFF AEM electrolyzer could operate for 500 h at 0.1 A cm-2.

To address the challenge of designing a highly reactive and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a hydrophilic Fe-CoPx nanorod array on nickel foam (NF) was designed and prepared in this work. The modulation of a d-band center of Co by adding Fe effectively optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates. The synergistic effect of the bimetallic active sites significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic performance for both reactions. In alkaline seawater, Fe-CoPx/NF exhibited excellent HER (−32 mV at −10 mA cm–2) and OER (216 mV at 10 mA cm–2) activities, maintaining stability for over 100 h at 100 mA cm–2. For overall seawater electrolysis, the catalyst achieved a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm–2, outperforming the conventional RuO2∥Pt/C electrode (1.58 V at 10 mA cm–2). Additionally, in a simulated industrial flow cell, the catalyst operated stably for over 200 h at 100 mA cm–2, indicating its strong potential for practical applications. This study introduced a simple synthesis method for bimetallic phosphides, providing a new avenue for the design of high-performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater electrolysis.

Water electrolysis is a promising path to the industrialization development of hydrogen energy. The exploitation of high-efficiency and inexpensive catalysts become important to the mass use of water decomposition. Ni-based nanomaterials have exhibited great potential for the catalysis of water splitting, which have attracted the attention of researchers around the world. Here, we prepared a novel Mo-doped NiFe-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) with a nanoarray microstructure on Ni foam. The doping amount of Mo can significantly change the microstructure of the electrocatalysis, which will further affect the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of water splitting. This novel nanomaterial required only an overpotential of 227 mV for 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 54.8 mV/dec in 1 M KOH. Meanwhile, there was no Mo, and the NiFe-LDH needed 233 mV to attain to 10 mA cm−2. Compared to the NiFe-LDH without Mo, the NiFeMo-LDH nanosheet arrays exhibited enhanced activities with 17.1 mV/dec less Tafel in OER. The good performance of the electrocatalyst is ascribed to the special nanosheet arrays and the heterostructure of the Ni-Fe-Mo system. These features help to increase the active surface, enhancing the efficient charge transfer and the reactive activity in OER.

Abstract The bi‐transition‐metal interstitial compounds (BTMICs) are promising for water electrolysis. The previous BTMICs are usually composed of irregular particles. Here, this work shows the synthesis of novel 1D Co 6 Mo 6 C‐based heterojunction nanowires (1D Co/Co 6 Mo 6 C) with diameters about 50 nm and a length‐to‐diameter ratio about 20 for efficient water electrolysis. An interesting growth process based on pyrolytically “squeezing” PMo 12 (Phosphomolybdic acid)/ZIF‐67 (Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework‐67) cube precursor is demonstrated. The “squeezing” growth is related to the role of Mo species for isolating Co species. A series of tests and theoretical calculation show the mutual regulation of Co and Mo to optimize the electronic structure, accelerating H 2 O dissociation and the reduction kinetics of H + . Additionally, the nanowires provide pathways for electron transfer and the transmission of reactants. Consequently, the 1D Co/Co 6 Mo 6 C exhibits high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction ( η 10 of 31 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction ( η 10 of 210 mV) in 1 m KOH. The electrolytic cell based on 1D Co/Co 6 Mo 6 C requires a low voltage of 1.43 V to drive 10 mA cm −2 . The catalyst also exhibits good HER performance in 1 m phosphate‐buffered saline solution, exceeding Pt/C at a current density >42 mA cm −2 .

Global photosynthesis is the key element of the recently proposed global carbon cycle model. It describes an integral action of ensemble of photosynthesizing organisms in large systems, like biosphere and global carbon cycle. At least two main features associated with the participation of global photosynthesis in large systems, differs it from conventional photosynthesis of individual organism. The first is the cyclic character of the photosynthesis evolution, and the second is spontaneous striving of global photosynthesis to the ecological compensation point that brings the carbon cycle to a stationary state. It is shown that the conventional photosynthesis equation should be modified to describe this process in the biosphere and in the global carbon cycle. The terms “living matter” and “sedimentary organic carbon” were used as an analog of biomass in the equation of global photosynthesis. Corresponding changes were made to describe the second product of global photosynthesis-atmospheric oxygen. Considering that the global carbon cycle reached the ecological compensation point that occurred in the Miocene, when the further accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere and sedimentary organic matter in the earth’s crust ended, the obtained approximate equations of photosynthesis were used to estimate the world’s potential oil resources. To test the predictive capability of the model we compared the above characteristic with its analogue, the world’s initial summary resources, calculated by independent geological methods. In spite of various assumptions a surprising proximity was found. It evidences that the model itself and underlying physical foundations are realistic and can be used as approximation in solving different problems in geology, evolution, climatology and related fields of knowledge.

High-capacity power battery can be attained through the elevation of the cut-off voltage for LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 high-nickel material. Nevertheless, unstable lattice oxygen would be released during the lithium deep extraction. To solve the above issues, the electronic structure is reconstructed by substituting Li+ ions with Y3+ ions. The dopant within the Li layer could transfer electrons to the adjacent lattice oxygen. Subsequently, the accumulated electrons in the oxygen site are transferred to nickel of highly valence state under the action of the reduction coupling mechanism. The modified strategy suppresses the generation of oxygen defects by regulating the local electronic structure, but more importantly, it reduces the concentration of highly reactive Ni4+ species during the charging state, thus avoiding the evolution of an unexpected phase transition. Strengthening the coupling strength between the lithium layers and transition metal layers finally realizes the fast-charging performance improvement and the cycling stability enhancement under high voltage. Authors report on restructuring the electronic structure of a high-nickel material by substituting Li+ ions with Y3+ ions. This strategy suppresses the generation of oxygen defects with a reduction coupling mechanism improving high-voltage stability.

Abstract Choosing the right and appropriate amount of substances in a changing environment is essential for the growth and survival of all species. We found that elevated oxygen levels significantly enhanced the iron-rich trapping devices of a nematode-trapping fungus (NTF), Arthrobotrys oligospora . Interestingly, genomic analysis revealed that all NTFs lacked coq7 , a key gene involved in ubiquinol (UQ) biosynthesis and iron chelation. Notably, A. oligospora utilizes UQ instead of UQ for low-aerobic respiration. Transcriptional, metabolic, mutational, and phenotypic analyses revealed that A. oligospora produces a chemotaxonomic class of highly oxygenated arthrobotrins with characteristics similar to UQ skeleton, for high-aerobic respiration. Disruption of arthrobotrin biosynthesis in the Δ art mutant not only enhanced UQ biosynthesis, but also triggered trapping device formation and nematicidal activity under elevated oxygen conditions. The addition of UQ to both wild-type and Δ art mutants strongly inhibited trapping device development. Remarkably, the iron-rich trapping devices preferentially capture N2 nematodes harboring iron-chelating COQ7 with ferritin properties. Time-calibrated evolutionary analyses, combined with geological data, indicated that the NTF ancestor lost the coq7 gene after acquiring the arthrobotrin biosynthetic gene cluster during the "superoligotrophy" period, characterized by dramatic shifts in global oxygen levels and temperature changes. Our results demonstrate that oxygen is a critical factor in inducing iron overload, highlighting the origin and role of coq7 loss in the evolution of predatory behavior of NTFs. Our finding that NTFs capture nematodes for iron chelation therapy, rather than for food, explains a long standing debate about the limited carnivorous ability of trapping devices.

Abstract The utilization of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs) has underscored their utility in high overpotential during the charging process. Among the currently known RMs, it is exceptionally challenging to identify those with a redox potential capable of attenuating singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generation while resisting degradation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as 1 O 2 and superoxide (O 2 •− ). In this context, computational and experimental approaches for rational molecular design have led to the development of 7,7′‐bi‐7‐azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (BAC), a newly suggested RM incorporating N–N interconnected aza‐bicycles. BAC harnesses the advantages of falling within the potential range that suppresses 1 O 2 generation, as previously reported N–N embedded non‐bicyclic RMs, and effectively defends against ROS‐induced degradation due to the incorporation of a novel bicyclic moiety. Unlike the non‐bicyclic RMs, which exhibit reduced O 2 evolution after exposure to 1 O 2 , BAC maintains consistent O 2 profiles during charging, indicating its superior 1 O 2 resistance and steady redox‐catalyst performance in LOBs. This study introduces a precise and rational design strategy for low‐molecular‐weight RMs, marking a significant step forward in advancing LOB development by improving efficiency, stability, and practical applicability.

Q355B is extensively utilised owing to its superior mechanical properties. Nevertheless, the inclusions generated during the deoxidation process with aluminium and the treatment with calcium in steelmaking can profoundly influence these properties. Consequently, this study explores the inclusions formed during the manufacturing process of Q355B utilising silicon–manganese deoxidation alloys in an industrial setting. Furthermore, this research evaluates the deoxidation efficacy of the silicon–manganese alloy and elucidates the fluctuations in oxygen and nitrogen concentrations throughout the entire process. This study further investigates the types, number density, size, morphology and transformation processes of the inclusions generated throughout the Q355B production using silicon–manganese deoxidation alloy; additionally, electrolytic treatment was performed on the cast billets to extract large inclusions. The findings reveal that the deoxidation efficiency of the SiMn alloy is enhanced at relatively low temperatures and with a high manganese-to-silicon ratio. The predominant cause for the increase in total oxygen content in the molten steel during the smelting process is the exposure of the molten steel to secondary oxidation. Manganese–silicon deoxidation adequately fulfils the production requirements for Q355B. Oxide inclusions predominantly comprise Si–Mn-type oxides and their evolved inclusions; during the evolution process, aluminium-containing spinels generate calcium aluminium silicates in conjunction with CaO present in the slag. The number density of inclusions consistently decreases; however, it may subsequently increase due to secondary oxidation and slag entrapment. Throughout the evolution process, inclusions continuously aggregate and grow, resulting in an increasing proportion of large inclusions, while small-sized sulphide inclusions precipitate during the continuous casting process. The analysis of the isothermal ternary phase diagram of the slag system, in conjunction with the electrolytic results of the cast billets, confirms the occurrence of secondary oxidation and slag entrapment during the smelting process. Thermodynamic software calculations elucidate the formation and evolution of composite inclusions, offering critical insights for composition control to mitigate the associated hazards of composite inclusions. Thermodynamic and kinetic calculations of precipitates clarify the solidification conditions and temperature required for the precipitation of MnS, demonstrating that the size of the precipitates is negatively correlated with the cooling rate and positively correlated with the concentration of the strongly segregated element sulphur.

The origin of complex life and the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems are fundamental aspects of the natural history on Earth. Here, we present evidence for a protracted stabilization of the Earth’s ozone layer. The destruction of atmospheric ozone today is inherently linked to the cycling of marine and atmospheric iodine. Supported by multiple independent lines of geological evidence and examined through an iodine mass balance model, we find that elevated marine iodide content prevailed through most of Earth’s history. Since the rise of oxygen ~2.4 billion years ago, high marine iodide concentrations would have led to significant inorganic iodine emissions to the atmosphere, facilitating catalytic ozone destruction and resulting in atmospheric ozone instability with periodic or persistently lower ozone levels. At a global scale, unstable and low ozone levels likely persisted for about two billion years until the early Phanerozoic, roughly 0.5 billion years ago. The delayed stabilization of the Earth’s ozone layer holds significant implications for the tempo and direction of the evolution of life, in particular life on land.

The elemental and isotopic abundances of major species in the Martian atmosphere have been determined, but analyses often lack sufficient precision, and those of minor and trace species are frequently not well known. Many important questions about the evolution and current state of Mars require the kind of knowledge that can be gained from analysis of a returned sample of the Martian atmosphere. Key target species include the noble gases, nitrogen, and various species containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, such as methane. More detailed analyses will no doubt provide measurements of other species that will allow insights of their own. These volatiles can constrain the origin of the Martian atmosphere, exchange of volatiles between the surface and interior, polar processes, and (in the case of methane) the possibility of extant biology on Mars.

Abstract Tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) based metal oxide semiconductor material has been conventionally used for sensing inorganic gases at elevated temperatures. However, in this study, the gas sensing performance of tungsten oxide‐based sensors is evaluated at room temperature. In this study, WO 3 quantum dots (QDs) are synthesized via the electrochemical method, followed by a microwave treatment to dehydrate them. The newly developed process is relatively less expensive and offers the flexibility to alter the structure in terms of phase, size, shape, and vacancy concentration. It is observed that electrochemical process parameters play an important role in phase evolution and control the oxygen vacancy concentration in the powder, which are essential for enhancing its gas sensing characteristics. Results showed an enhanced gas‐sensing ability of WO 3 QDs at room temperature toward inorganic gases, such as CO, NO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 when subjected to microwave treatment. The enhanced gas‐sensing performance of microwave‐treated WO 3 QDs is attributed to its smaller size and high oxygen vacancy concentration. The minimum limit of detection values for CO, NO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 at room temperature using microwave‐treated hydrated tungsten oxide QDs were 4.60, 1.5, 0.35, and 10.25 ppm, respectively.

Abstract Understanding the behavior of high‐entropy carbides (HECs) under oxygen‐containing environments is of particular importance for their promising applications in structural components, catalysis, and energy‐related fields. Herein, the structural evolution of (Ta, Ti, Cr, Nb)C (HEC‐1) nanoparticles (NPs) is tracked in situ during the oxidation at the atomic scale by using an open‐cell environmental aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Three key stages are clearly discerned during the oxidation of HEC‐1 NPs at the atomic level below 900 °C: i) increased amorphization of HEC‐1 NPs from 300 to 500 °C due to the energetically favorable formation of carbon vacancies and substitution of carbon with oxygen atoms; ii) nucleation and subsequent growth of locally ordered nanocluster intermediates within the generated amorphous oxides from 500 to 800 °C; and iii) final one‐step crystallization of non‐equimolar MeO 2 and Me 2 O 5 (Me = metallic elements, Ta, Ti, Cr, and Nb) high‐entropy oxides above 800 °C, accompanied with the reduction in atomic defects. This result is further confirmed by theoretical calculations that these observed high‐entropy oxide phases are thermodynamically preferable to generate above 830 °C. The study provides direct evidence of the ordered–disordered–ordered structural transition of HECs during oxidation.

Platinum is the most efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, the lack of earth abundance and high cost restrict its widespread use. Herein, we report electrocatalytic HER efficacy of oxygen-deficient, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-active tungsten-oxide (WO3–x) nanocrystals (NCs) as a function of free conduction electron density and metal oxidation states. These plasmonic, anisotropic WO3–x NCs display ∼160 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 54 mV/dec. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopic measurements support the HER electrocatalytic properties attributed to the Fermi energy pinning as a function of the NC shape (i.e., nanowires, nanorods, and nanoplatelets) and chemical composition of the inorganic WO3–x lattice. Furthermore, our experimental data show that increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated tungsten sites, which are generated from the ionization of surface oxygen atoms in WO3–x NCs, improves the surface reactivity and thus, enhances the catalytic performance. Together, structure–property relationship delineating the NC morphology and the resulting optoelectronic properties studied here provide the opportunity to unravel the correlation between the NC shape, free conduction electron density and the HER kinetics of this unique class of NC and to potentially initiate the designer principle of noble metal-free, highly active, but not limited to HER catalysts to produce an energy-dense fuel.

Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

Abstract Speleothem oxygen isotope records offer unique insights into Asian Monsoon evolution, with their precise chronologies used to identify abrupt climatic events. However, individual records are sometimes used to draw broad conclusions about global climate, without considering the dynamical context in which they exist. We present a robust framework for assessing the regional significance, and hence the potential global significance, of paleoclimate events, using the proposed Meghalayan age onset (associated with the “4.2 ka event”) as a case study. Analyzing 14 well‐dated speleothem oxygen isotope records from the SISAL v3 database and recent literature, we investigate the regional coherency of rapid shifts in Asian paleohydrology, which is the regional center of action for the proposed event, over the Holocene. Three robust methods fail to detect spatially coherent variability consistent with a 4.2 ka event across Asia, either because none exists or because it is of insufficient magnitude. In contrast, the 8.2 ka event is expressed in most records that resolve it. The absence of a clear isotopic excursion across this data set suggests that the “4.2 ka megadrought” was not global, with important implications for archeology and geochronology. This casts doubt on the proposal that the 4.2 ka event marks the onset of a new geologic age. We do, however, observe support for a gradual isotopic enrichment between 3.9 and 3.6 ka, followed by partial recovery—consistent with the “Double Drying” hypothesis and possibly related to changes in El Niño‐Southern Oscillation variability.

Abstract To study the effect of dose-rate in the time evolution of chemical yields produced in pure water versus a cellular-like environment for FLASH radiotherapy research. &#xD;A version of TOPAS-nBio with Tau-Leaping algorithm was used to simulate the homogenous chemistry stage of water radiolysis using three chemical models: 1) liquid water model that considered scavenging of eaq-, H● by dissolved oxygen; 2) Michaels & Hunt model that considered scavenging of ●OH, eaq-, and H● by biomolecules existing in cellular environment; 3) Wardman model that considered model 2) and the chemical repair enzyme glutathione (GHS). H2O2 concentrations at conventional and FLASH dose-rates were compared with published measurements. Model 3) was used to estimate DNA single-strand break (SSB) yields and compared with published data. SSBs were estimated from simulated yields of DNA hydrogen abstraction and attenuation factors to account for the scavenging capacity of the medium. The simulation setup consisted of monoenergetic protons (100 MeV) delivered in pulses at conventional (0.2857Gy s⁻¹) and FLASH (500Gy s⁻¹) dose rates. Dose varied from 5-20Gy, and oxygen concentration from 10µM-1mM.&#xD;At the steady state, for model 1), H2O2 concentration differed by 81.5%±4.0% between FLASH and conventional dose-rates. For models 2) and 3) the differences were within 8.0%±4.8%, and calculated SSB yields agreed with published data within 3.8%±1.2%. A maximum oxygen concentration difference of 60% and 50% for models 2) and 3) between conventional and FLASH dose-rates was found between 2106 and 91013 ps for 20 Gy of absorbed dose.&#xD;The findings highlight the importance of developing more advanced cellular models to account for both the chemical and biological factors that comprise the FLASH effect. It was found that differences between pure water and cellular environment models were significant and extrapolating results between the two should be avoided. Observed differences call for further experimental investigation.

Herein, we report a simple mechanochemical dehydration (MD) method to synthesize MD-NiMoO4, which is treated with NaBH4 to generate oxygen vacancy-enriched MD-NiMoO4–SBH to understand the role of oxygen defects on water splitting performance. Among the as-prepared catalysts, MD-NiMoO4–SBH, MD-NiMoO4, MD-NiO, and MD-MoO, MD-NiMoO4–SBH exhibits superior activity by demanding a small overpotential (OER/HER) of 241/108 mV with a Tafel slope of 97/85 mV dec–1 (MD-NiMoO4: 293/156 mV; Tafel slope: 114/93 mV dec–1) and is stable for ∼100 h. The activation energies were calculated for electrolysis using MD-NiMoO4–SBH (32 kJ/mol) and MD-NiMoO4 (28 kJ/mol). The calculated integrated areas of 5.41 × 10–5 AV (MD-NiMoO4–SBH) and 3.61 × 10–5 AV (MD-NiMoO4) confirmed MOOH* formation, and the number of active sites was found to be 3.484 × 10–16 (MD-NiMoO4) and 6.540 × 10–16 (MD-NiMoO4–SBH). The superaerophobicity of MD-NiMoO4–SBH was corroborated by rapid gas bubble growth as well as fast evolution from the catalyst surface. The bifunctional electrolyzer with MD-NiMoO4–SBH (1.48 V) and MD-NiMoO4 (1.59 V) released vigorous gas bubbles in the alkaline electrolyte and exhibits robust durability, which could be employed in water splitting devices for practical utility. As observed from the electrochemical results, the MO theory reveals that the band gap state-assisted antibonding state formation, having low electron occupancy to favor OER and HER kinetics.

We report transport measurements of infinite-layer cuprate Sr1−xEuxCuO2+y films with controlled electron (by trivalent europium) and hole (by interstitial apical oxygen) carriers grown on SrTiO3(001) with molecular beam epitaxy. An unusual enhancement of superconductivity upon the moderate coexistence of electron and hole carriers in the films is found, which spans over the whole superconducting phase diagram and becomes more prominent in the underdoped regime. The superconductivity exhibits a two-dimensional nature with a thickness of approximately 5.2 nm, irrespective of the varying carriers, confirmed by angle-resolved magnetoresistance measurements and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Nevertheless, the coexisting electron and hole carriers enlarge the thermal activation energy of vortex motion that deviates obviously from the usual logarithmic evolution with the magnetic field. Our results offer a promising perspective to understand and enhance the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon Physics Subject Headings (PhySH)MagnetoresistanceSuperconductivityCupratesSuperconductorsThin filmsResistivity measurements

The 2D CdSe/CdS core/shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) have recently emerged as a new class of promising photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. Here, we have synthesized 2D/2D composites of CdSe/CdS core/shell nanoplatelets with MoS2 nanosheets for photocatalytic water splitting where hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution rates are 221.4 (909.7 μmol·g–1) and 114.8 μmol·g–1·h–1 (461.1 μmol·g–1), respectively, under 360 nm laser irradiation. Notably, an extraordinary external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 76.12% is obtained. The interfacial charge transfer dynamics are elucidated through steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates delayed recovery kinetics, corroborating the enhanced charge separation and transfer processes within the composite structure. The underlying mechanisms of the enhanced photocatalytic behavior elucidate the role of the 2D/2D interface. The synergistic integration of CdSe/CdS NPLs with MoS2 NSs results in an extended light absorption range, improved charge separation, and increased availability of catalytic active sites, collectively contributing to superior photocatalytic performance.

Small RNAs (sRNA) play an essential role in the epigenetic modulation of the genome. They are implicated in numerous processes, encompassing factors that mitigate both abiotic and biotic stressors. Notable among these are heat shock proteins (HSP), enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and nuclear factor Y (NF-Y). Molecularly, sRNAs are characterized by sequences of approximately 21–23 nucleotides in length. Based on contemporary understandings in plant science, numerous abiotic constraints have the potential to curtail crop yield, growth, and reproductive potential in plants. These constraints exert their deleterious effects by undermining cellular homeostasis, perturbing ionic equilibrium, and impinging upon essential physiological processes. However, evolution has endowed certain plant species with the ability to adapt to elevated thermal conditions through the nuanced regulation of genes and proteins, notably heat shock factors (HSF) and HSP. While there has been an incremental growth in literature concerning microRNA (miRNA) functionality in plants, the emergent targets of miRNA and their intricate relationship with the HSF-HSP complex remain underexplored. In this scholarly review, we delve into the thermal responses of HSF-HSP in both Hordeum vulgare and Arabidopsis thaliana, emphasizing their regulation by miRNA under conditions of heat stress.

Safety and ecological health are restricted by the high amount of suspended sediment in the Yellow River. To solve the problems of the high sediment content and siltation in the Yellow River, the Xiaolangdi Reservoir (XLDR) has been carrying out water–sediment regulation (WSR) since 2002. To clarify the effects of the water and sediment changes caused by WSR on microbial communities, we analysed the composition of the microbial communities and functional groups in surface water and sediments before and after WSR using high-throughput sequencing and microbial functional annotation. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were detected as the main microbial communities in the Yellow River’s middle and lower reaches. The water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and evolution of the microbial communities were all correlated (p < 0.05). The biodiversity indices of the surface water and sediment microbes, respectively, greatly declined. The WSR programme broke down nutrients that had been adsorbed on the sediments, which diminished microbial metabolic activity and impaired the water bodies’ capacity to purify themselves. In summary, this study provides the biological information needed for the ecological conservation of the Yellow River basin, as well as insights into the changes in and response characteristics of microorganisms following severe disturbances in rivers with high sediment concentrations.

Abstract Helium nuclei (alpha particles) strongly influence the momentum and energy balance in the solar wind, comprising up to 20% of the solar wind mass density. In fast Alfvénic wind at heliocentric distances greater than 0.3 au, the alpha particles’ bulk flow speed is systematically different to that of the protons. This relative drift speed is of unknown origin and is often close to the local Alfvén wave speed. Novel Parker Solar Probe measurements of the solar wind below 0.3 au show that, closer to the Sun, the alpha–proton drift speed remains on the order of 100–200 km s −1 , even where the Alfvén speed is greater than 600 km s −1 . This relative speed is quantitatively similar to oxygen–hydrogen drift speeds observed in the transition region by remote sensing, suggesting similar selective acceleration processes in the corona. Due to the relative speed of the Alfvén wave to each particle population close to the Sun, the alphas fluctuate with velocity amplitudes comparable to those of the protons, altering the energy balance of the wave. As a result, alpha particles carry a significant fraction of the total kinetic energy in Alfvénic fluctuations in the near-Sun solar wind. The alpha–proton drift speed is comparable to the proton speed in the near-Sun wind, making the bulk flow of the alpha particles a significant contribution to the kinetic energy flux. These heavy-ion dynamics provide new observational constraints on quantifying the energy budget of the solar wind and the magnetic field evolution through the heliosphere.

T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with an 80-year recurrence interval whose next eruption is imminent. We aim to resolve the accretion mechanism of the binary system governing the mass transfer during its super-active phase. Using phase-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy, we analyze the zoo of spectral-line profiles arising from the symbiotic activity. We perform Doppler tomography of selected emission lines to resolve the system's gaseous components and their different velocity regimes. We find evidence of enhanced accretion through Roche lobe overflow during the super-active phase, as traced by the oxygen, helium, and hydrogen lines. The accretion disc is found to be fully viscously evolved and extends up to its maximal radius. By mapping the kinematics of lines probing different excitation energies, we can identify distinct interaction sites. These include the bright spot at the stream impact on the accretion disc outer radius, the irradiation at the red-giant facing side, the stream-disc overflow, the accretion disk wind, and an expanding bipolar nebula. The bipolar jet emerged at the rise of the super-active phase and underwent an acceleration phase of about five years. The temporal evolution of the lines supports the scenario where the departure from quiescence started in the disc, likely triggered by a disc instability similar to what occurs in dwarf novae outburst, leading to an increased mass accretion and causing important irradiation of the giant that has further enhanced the mass-transfer rate during the super-active phase. Conclusions. Symbiotic recurrent novae, such as T CrB, are governed by similar mass-transfer mechanisms as found in cataclysmic variables despite their different orbital properties (longer orbital periods imposing larger accretion discs) and evolutionary pathways.

Coal spontaneous combustion in goaf seriously affects the safety of mine production, and air leakage is one of the prerequisites for coal spontaneous combustion. Taking the ultra-long working face with a length of 410 m as an example, due to the insufficient compaction degree of the goaf, the high development of large-scale cracks, and the large air flow pressure difference between the intake and return air, the air leakage law in the goaf is not clear, and the risk of spontaneous combustion of broken residual coal increases. Based on the physical and mechanical parameters of coal rock, this paper studies the plastic failure and fracture development in the goaf under various stress disturbances in ultra-long working faces. The laws of gas migration and air leakage in goaf of ultra-long working face was studied by means of field test and numerical simulation. Based on the theory of coal-oxygen composite in goaf, the dangerous areas of coal spontaneous combustion in goaf with different mining sequence evolution of ultra-long working face were determined. Based on the distribution of air leakage flow field and coal spontaneous combustion danger zone in goaf, the comprehensive fire prevention and extinguishing technology of nitrogen injection inerting, plugging and leakage reduction was applied in field demonstration, and the application effect was verified. The research results show that the plastic failure range of overlying strata in goaf presents "saddle shape." The permeability and porosity increase gradually from the middle to the surrounding direction, showing "O-ring" distribution. The main air leakage channels are concentrated at the intake air tunnel corner of the goaf and 160–200 m of the working face. The air leakage sinks are located at a distance of 20–80 m along the dip direction of the working face and at the return corner of the working face, respectively. The average air leakage is 268 m3/min and 153 m3/min, and the maximum width of the coal spontaneous combustion danger zone in the goaf during the dynamic advancement of the ultra-long working face is 107 m. Through comprehensive fire prevention and extinguishing techniques such as nitrogen injection for inerting and filling with high-molecular-weight gel for sealing and leakage reduction, the prevention and control of coal spontaneous combustion in ultra-long working faces at different mining sequences under corresponding engineering backgrounds are effectively ensured.    

    

## Timing is everything: complex (a)synchrony of heart–muscle interactions during exercise

Exercise requires physiological adjustments to defend regulatory variables. Oxygen delivery is augmented to support metabolic rate, inactive tissues vasoconstrict to maintain blood pressure, the vasculature dilates to support convective heat transfer, cardiovascular reflexes maintain perfusion and arterial pressure, etc. At the whole-body level, the result is the sustainment of power output until metabolic demand outpaces oxygen supply. While numerous tissues are involved during exercise, it is fair to say that the cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal systems dominate: the former as the contractile units driving locomotion and the latter as driving oxygen transport required for energy provision. Thus, it would make sense that there is a physiological link between muscle and cardiac activity, such that they exhibit temporal coordination to achieve efficient movement. During concentric muscle contractions intramuscular pressure transiently impedes flow, followed by hyperaemia during relaxation due to an increased pressure gradient across the muscle vasculature. Theoretically, coupling of muscle contraction with cardiac rhythms (cardio-locomotor coupling) dissociates the peaks of intramuscular and arterial pressure occurring at the same time, promoting greater blood flow in muscle and decreasing cardiac afterload. Natural entrainment of heart rate (HR) and cadence occurs during running (Kirby et al., 1989), and coaching foot strikes to occur during diastole is haemodynamically beneficial. However, previous investigations used surrogates of muscle activity (foot strike) and measured only snapshots of exercise responses (i.e. stroke volume at specified time points). This is a broader limitation of physiology in general where, due to historical inertia and methodological limitations, our data sometimes fail to capture the human body as a non-linear dynamic network by relying on isolated/static measures to explain complex physiology. When viewed as a complex adaptive system, the outcomes (e.g. aerobic performance) cannot be solely determined by one component (e.g. cardiac output or mitochondrial content) (Balague et al., 2020). Even higher-level isolated variables such as running economy, which represents several individual physiological characteristics (biomechanics, muscle and tendon properties, bioenergetics), is not sufficient by itself to explain performance. Complex networks (e.g. a city) are made up of individual nodes/components (businesses, homes, people) that interact through various connections/linkages (transportation systems, relationships). The collective behaviour of the city (its economy or flow of resources and information) cannot be determined by an individual component but how all the nodes interact. Seminal work by Bashan et al. (2012) introduced the field of Network Physiology as the human organism exemplifies the integration of multiple systems to achieve an outcome. The authors showed substantial connectivity between and within the brain and periphery during sleep, and importantly, how these connections facilitated the emergence of basic physiological conditions (transition from deep to light sleep) (Bashan et al., 2012). Globally, the field focuses on how hierarchically structured organ systems interact and adapt in real time to achieve, and transition between, different physiological states (e.g. sleep/wake, rest/exercise, health/disease), relying on continuous streams of data from areas of interest. In this issue of the Journal of Physiology, Garcia-Retortillo and Ivanov studied heart–muscle coupling during exhaustive exercise through a Network Physiology framework (Garcia-Retortillo & Ch Ivanov, 2024). Their study comprehensively analysed the cardiomuscular network, its dynamic function during exercise and its relationship to fatigue. Two important methodological points differentiating this study from previous work were the use of EMG (compared to cadence) coupled with ECG and cross-correlation analyses of instantaneous EMG and ECG signals to visualize network evolution over time. The exercise protocol was relatively simple: participants performed two sets of bodyweight squats at a specified tempo (3 s eccentric/3 s concentric) until exhaustion, separated by 5 min (acute and residual fatigue). Electrodes for EMG were placed on both quadriceps and erector spinae. Decomposition of EMG spectral power signals allowed grouping into 10 different frequency bands, ranging from 10–29.5 Hz (F1) up to 205–224.5 Hz (F10), with the rationale of correspondence to muscle fibre types (type I: F1–F2; type IIa: F3–F7; type IIx: F8–F10). Cardio-muscle synchrony was determined with cross-correlations between HR (ECG) and EMG frequency bands (negative correlation = −1, positive correlation = 1), and then link strength was determined between each heart–muscle pair, resulting in >17,000 links given their sample size, exercise bouts and number of EMG locations. Essentially, link strength represents the degree of coupling observed (higher link strength = better coupling). The variability of the coupling in relation to time was further assessed by analysing the first and last third of each bout. In essence, the temporal variability (analysed at short and large time scales) would allow for the identification of the transition between sustainability and fatigue (synchrony and asynchrony). Both EMG and ECG activity were periodized into 6 s windows corresponding to the exercise tempo, with their signals virtually overlapping one another in the first half of exercise, with greater synchrony in the quadriceps than the erector spinae. Muscle activity and EMG spectral band amplitude increased progressively with fatigue, reflecting the need for higher threshold motor unit recruitment to meet the physical demand. There was also a non-linear decline in respiratory sinus arrhythmia amplitude, probably pointing to cardiovascular reflex-driven increased ventilatory demands with accumulating fatigue. As a result, HR spectral power declined with fatigue due to cardiac sympathetic activity. Remarkably, regardless of HR or EMG amplitude throughout exercise, the peaks of spectral power consistently occurred at 0.15 Hz, aligning with exercise tempo (1 squat/6 s = 0.15). Thus, EMG and ECG signals always retained their periodicity in regard to the prescribed tempo, but they fell out of sync with each other when fatigue set in. In general, link strengths between EMG and ECG signals were far stronger in the lower frequency bands, indicating the heart may be more fine-tuned with oxidative muscle fibre activity. However, as fatigue accumulated, link strength was degraded more in the low-frequency bands and the fibre type-specific link strength differences were lost. Overall link strength was reduced by ∼45 (quadriceps) to 60% (low back) compared to the non-fatigued state. During exercise bout 2 (residual fatigue), coupling strength was reduced in all frequency bands, but much more in the F6–F10 range (type IIa–IIx), exemplifying the lack of fatigue resistance in these fibres. A more frequent and earlier onset of negative cross-correlation (link strength) values was more prevalent in the higher versus lower frequency bands during exercise bouts 1 and 2. In one subject, the cross-correlation in the F10 band was almost fully negative from the first contraction onwards (fig. 6A in the paper). Accumulation of fatigue reduced the probability of positive cross-correlations (positive = better coupling) across all linkages by 20% and increased the probability of anti-correlations by ∼40%; residual fatigue further worsened these coupling probabilities. Collectively, using advanced analytical methods, the authors were able to precisely quantify how heart and muscle signals interact. Further, they demonstrate (1) its strength between different muscles and fibre types, (2) that decreased coupling relates to parasympathetic withdrawal and neuromuscular fatigue, and importantly (3) the dynamic changes over time (on a time scale of a few seconds) from the fresh to fatigued state, within and between exercise bouts. Reductionist studies have helped to explain exercise physiology mechanistically (e.g. training-induced muscle mitochondrial quality control). However, exercise involves several layers of interacting systems contributing to whole-body outcomes and isolated molecular analyses are only one facet of a larger organization. It is precisely this fact that 'exercise in a pill' remains elusive – exercise is truly an integrative phenomenon that cannot be represented or replicated by focusing on one component. While advances in molecular biology and -omics technology have been profound, by definition these methods confine exercise to a single restrained level of analysis, ignoring or overlooking the complexity of observations observed in the field (Balague et al., 2020). Molecular studies of course have an upside but may stall progress for bigger translational questions (Joyner, 2011). Placing more onus on the Network Physiology of exercise and how it complements previous methods may be an avenue to accelerate our understanding of what reductionism can provide. The unique methods and results from Garcia-Retortillo and Ch Ivanov (2024) open the door to a wide range of new research and complement previous seminal work, extending the cardio-locomotor coupling concept. Mortensen et al. (2013) showed improving muscle oxidative capacity alone favourably influences cardiac responses to exercise and improves exercise intolerance. Inherent in these findings is the role of skeletal muscle afferents in cardiac autonomic control, where heightened metaboreflex sensitivity precipitates fatigue, dyspnoea and adrenergic activation, but is modifiable by training (Aimo et al., 2021). Postural and orthostatic challenges during exercise can also influence sympathetic outflow via the baroreflex. Recently, a more crude coupling concept, the ratio of internal (%HRmax) and external workload (% of critical speed, CS) (Smyth et al., 2022), was effectively applied in an analysis of >80,000 marathon runners. Low versus high 'decouplers' ran faster by 0.3 m/s on average, experienced decoupling onset ∼14 km later (33 vs. 19 km) and ran at a higher fraction of CS (88 vs. 82%). Collectively, the cardiomuscular network is an integrator of inputs regulating cardiac sympathetic activity, with its temporal resolution precisely defining the deviation from homeostasis and onset/presence of fatigue. Further, the progressive recruitment of type II fibres is one proposed mediator of the V ̇ O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ slow component (and thus fatigue). Indeed, activity in higher EMG frequency bands temporally aligned with fatigue and cardiac sympathetic activity, indicating a loss of efficiency and suggesting better synchrony with type I fibres. The latter finding is quite profound, emphasizing muscle activity rather than cadence per se is a crucial component of the network, shedding light on another feature of the intensity–duration relationship. Fibre-specific synchrony may also have a teleological underpinning given the unique capacity of Homo sapiens for slow-twitch endurance activity. Many sport-related phenomena will probably not be resolved by further increasing our capability to measure biological molecules but by incorporating new laws of physiological regulation (Bartsch et al., 2015). Prime examples include the mechanistic basis of fatigue, which are still debated (Westerblad, 2016), and overtraining syndrome. In both cases a bottom-up model (molecules transmitting information 'up' to affect the whole body) has often been assumed. Fatigue involves various physiological (molecules, cells and organs) and psychological (motivation and stress) factors and develops across disparate time scales. Overtraining is a complex disorder of non-functional coupling between systems, and current biomarkers (e.g. hormones and HR variability) are alone inadequate for its detection. Quantifying physiological coupling between diverse systems may be a superior strategy to isolated tests and has already been demonstrated for detecting autonomic dysfunction (Balague et al., 2020; Da Silva et al., 2023). Accepting the multifactorial origin of these states, greater measurement accuracy can be achieved shifting from a microscopic to mesoscopic approach (Balague et al., 2022). Through Network Physiology, mesoscopic variables can be identified (e.g. coupling) which operate at a higher organizational level, integrate multiple levels of physiological systems and allow for various directions of causal interactions between systems (bottom-up, top-down, horizontal, circular causality, etc.) (Balague et al., 2022). It makes sense to use integrated methods to measure integrated phenomena. Importantly, these variables capture the effect of what is occurring cellularly but constrain the microscopic fluctuations. For instance, heart–muscle link strength in the current study (Garcia-Retortillo & Ch Ivanov, 2024) may be strengthened by increased muscle perfusion, but in this context it is not relevant to know whether the perfusion was caused by microscopic fluctuations in nitric oxide or prostaglandins (known vasodilators). Hence a major question to tackle in the future is how to re-compose previously decomposed physiological mechanisms of exercise and fatigue (Balague et al., 2022). This new model of physiological analysis and cardiomuscular synchrony opens the door for new ideas involving its trainability, application to training prescription, modification by disease and extreme environments, recovery from asynchrony to synchrony, changes during work rate transitions and alignment with other endurance parameters. It is likely that stronger network connectivity, complexity and diversity is a feature of high 'resilience' or 'durability' in athletes (Smyth et al., 2022) and by extension the general population, making these metrics relevant. The growing body of work in the Network Physiology field suggests it can be applied to nearly all health and disease states, and the future of its application to exercise may lead us to novel findings that are unattainable by traditional methods.
