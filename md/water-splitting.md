Abstract Supercapacitors (SCs) and secondary batteries (SBs) are commonly utilized for energy storage, although each has some limitations: low energy density (Ed) and power density (Pd), respectively. To address these issues, a hybrid supercapacitor is a new emerging technique known as supercapattery, which combines both of these devices to optimum the Ed and Pd in a single setting. The hydrothermal method was adopted to synthesize a cost-effective, eco-friendly, and non-toxic SrCoS/PANI, a composite material for optimum results of supercapattery. Crystallinity and morphology study of synthesized nanocomposites strontium cobalt sulfide with Polyaniline (SrCoS/PANI) were examined using SEM and XRD techniques. Initially, the performance was tested using a three-electrode setup of nanocomposites (SrCoS/PANI) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The effectiveness of a SrCoS/PANI-activated carbon two-electrode supercapattery was examined through cyclic CV, GCD, and EIS techniques. In the two electrodes setup, the device performs admirably with an astonishing specific capacity of 139.4 C/g, a high Ed of 29.56 Wh/kg, and a high Pd of 800 W/kg at 1.0 A/g. The cyclic stability was tested by putting the device through 5000 charging and discharging cycles, which maintained 91.65 % of its Specific capacity (Qs). A hybrid nanocomposite (SrCoS/PANI) device was accomplished, with exceptional electrochemical capabilities at a low price making them a fascinating active material with potential applications in supercapattery technology. The electrocatalytic performance of the synthesized nanostructure (NSs) was studied comprehensively with regard to an oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential reaction commonly applied in various energy storage and conversion technologies. One of the common issues of OER lies in its low kinetic activity. Therefore, developing durable, low-cost, and high-performance OER catalysts is critical. Recently, many attempts have used stainless steel mesh (SSM) as the substrate for OER electrodes because SSM is abundant, cheap, and durable. Nickel/iron-based materials, i.e., NiFe 2 O 4 /NiFe layer double hydroxides (LDHs), are regarded as one of the most excellent OER catalysts in alkaline electrolytes, making them attractive low-cost materials for OER catalysts. However, synthesizing NiFe 2 O 4 /NiFe LDHs directly on the surface of SSM is challenging. Modifying the SSM surface through cathodization has proved to enhance the adhesion and OER activity. Moreover, the cathodization technique is facile and cost-effective. In this work, the surface of SSM is modified by cathodization treatment. Subsequently, NiFe 2 O 4 /NiFe LDHs are deposited onto the surface of treated SSM via a low-temperature one-step chemical bath deposition technique. This synthesis is a binder-free method; the resulted electrodes show excellent OER performance without the binder effects. The as-prepared electrodes have a small Tafel slope of 125.4 mV/dec (1 M KOH) and high durability (10 mA/cm2 for 50 hours).

Abstract CeO 2 greatly enhances the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of CoO x , though the enhancement mechanism beyond this synergy is yet to be understood. Here, operando hard X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (hXAS) is applied to monitor the Co K edge and Ce L 3 edge in CoO x /CeO 2 to shed light on the evolution of the Co and Ce oxidation states during OER. In addition, ex situ soft XAS (sXAS) characterizations provide information on the irreversible surface‐specific transformations of the Co L 3 edge as well as of the O K edge. Combining the operando and ex situ spectroscopic characterizations with comprehensive electrochemical analyses, it is confirmed that CeO 2 is not the active center for the OER. However, coupling CeO 2 with CoO x introduces significant modifications in the Co and O species at the CoO x surface and alters the flat band potential (E fb ), leading to more favorable Co oxidation state transformations during OER and possibly modifying the preferential reaction pathway. This work establishes the connections between electronic structures, Co oxidation state and the OER reaction mechanism for CoO x /CeO 2 composites electrodes.

The scarcity of state‐of‐the‐art oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts has led to intensive research on alternative viable electrocatalytic materials. While activity and cost are the main factors to be sought after, the catalyst stability under harsh acidic conditions is equally crucial. Considering that OER is a proton‐coupled electron‐transfer reaction that involves local acidification of the reaction environment by liberation of H + , the catalyst stability can be largely compromised in such conditions. Consequently, probing the pH value near the catalyst surface under operation leads to a deeper understanding of this process. The applicability of bare Au microelectrodes and nanoelectrodes as sensitive local pH probes during OER is shown in this work by using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Two case studies are presented, including the state‐of‐the‐art OER catalyst (IrO 2 ) in acidic media and a ZnGa 2 O 4 catalyst in alkaline buffered solution, demonstrating the suitability of the Au probe to accurately determine the local pH value in a wide pH range.

The use of magnetic fields as external stimuli to improve the kinetics of electrochemical reactions is attracting substantial attention, given their potential to reduce energy losses. Despite recent reports showing a positive effect on catalytic performance upon applying a magnetic field to a working electrode, there are still many uncertainties and a lack of experimental evidence correlating the presence of the magnetic field to the electrocatalytic performance. Here, we present a combination of electrochemical and spectroscopic tools that demonstrate how the presence of an external magnetic field alters the reaction mechanism of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), accelerating the overall performance of a Ni4FeOx electrode. Complementary experimental evidence has been gathered supporting the participation of this microscopic magnetic field effect. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) points to a speed-up of the intrinsic reaction kinetics, independent of other indirect effects. In the same direction, the spectro-electrochemical fingerprint of the intermediate species that appear during the electrocatalytic cycle, as detected under operando conditions, indicates a change in the order of the reaction as a function of hole accumulation. All these experimental data confirm the direct influence of an external magnetic field on the reaction mechanism at the origin of the magnetically enhanced electrocatalytic OER.

The stability studies, using a rotating disk electrode under a constant current, are commonly used for the development of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, where rise in potential with time is reported to be due to the electrocatalyst degradation. Here, we present a careful examination on the use of this technique on commercial IrO2 electrocatalysts in acidic media for a duration of 9 h. We observed that a sudden rise in the electrode potential after ∼6 h is rather due to the glassy carbon surface-edge corrosion and detachment between carbon–catalyst interfaces. Indeed, the layer detachment generates an insulating gap between the electrode and carbon layer, resulting in an increase in the cell potential. On this regard, we examine and recommend a potentiodynamic stability test as a reliable and practical method for fast material screening and for the development of OER electrocatalysts.

Improving the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable and environmentally friendly hydrogen energy. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for the OER. However, a thorough understanding of the impact of structural disorder and defects on the catalytic activity of LDHs remains limited. In this work, a series of NiAl-LDH models are systematically constructed, and their OER performance is rigorously screened through theoretical density functional theory. The acquired results unequivocally reveal that the energy increase induced by structural disorder is effectively counteracted at the defect surface, indicating the coexistence of defects and disorder. Notably, it is ascertained that the simultaneous presence of defects and disorder synergistically augments the catalytic activity of LDHs in the context of the OER. These theoretical findings offer valuable insights into the design of highly efficient OER catalysts while also shedding light on the efficacy of LDH electrocatalysts.

Abstract During the past few years, single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in electrolysis due to their outstanding catalytic performance and efficient atomic utilization. SACs exhibit a simple structure, high catalytic activity, consistent scaling relationships for single sites, and low metal content but their practical applications are still limited. Dual single‐atom catalysts (DACs), which feature excellent selectivity, high atomic utilization efficiency, and remarkable stability, are emerging as new frontiers in heterogeneous electrocatalysis. They increase catalytic activity by promoting synergistic effects between metal‐active sites. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in dual‐atom catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In addition, we explore the differences between homonuclear and heteronuclear configurations, the emergence of single/dual‐site metal catalysts, and the methods currently used for their synthesis. Lastly, this review discusses several perspectives for advancing the development of dual‐atom catalysts for OER and ORR electrocatalysis.

Constructing nano-heterojunction catalysts is a highly efficient method for enhancing the thermodynamics and kinetics towards oxygen evolution reaction. In the present study, NiFe-LDH nanoparticles in-situ grown on Co3O4 nanowires bring about abundant heterogeneous interfaces, which productively increase specific surface area and tune electron density distribution. The as-obtained composite comprises rich unsaturated Co sites on Co3O4 and hybrid crystalline/amorphous NiFe-LDH phase, both of which expedite the flow of charge and expose large amounts of active sites. The Co-Ni-Fe electron transport channels are established at the core-shell heterojunction with the transmission of electrons from Co3O4 to NiFe-LDH. The resultant optimal Co3O4@NiFe-LDH/NF-100 catalyst displayed attractive OER activity with low overpotential of 270 mV at 50 mA cm−2, along with excellent durability in alkaline media. This typical core-shell heterojunction promotes H2O dissociation and strengthens the adsorption of intermediates, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction.

Electrical stimulation and oxygen are vital for promoting cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation to repair damaged tissues in chronic wound healing in patients with diabetes. The effective oxygen production by Chlorella has garnered attention in the medical field, but the potential of extracellular electron production in skin repair has not been explored. Inspired by this, we developed CHPS hydrogels, a composite of polyacrylamide and sodium alginate, with Chlorella loaded in a semi-interpenetrating network. This network is formed by crosslinking acrylamide initiated by free radicals, with alginate chains dispersed within the network. When applied to wounds, CHPS hydrogels effectively protect damaged tissue, provide mechanical support to Chlorella against external forces, and create an optimal artificial microenvironment to promote the proliferation of Chlorella. Our study demonstrated that CHPS hydrogels exhibit remarkable fracture elongation and adhesion properties and continuously produce oxygen and bioelectrical currents through photosynthesis. Furthermore, the sustained release of dissolved oxygen and bioelectricity by CHPS hydrogels significantly enhances cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, leading to improved wound healing in diabetic mice. These findings provide compelling evidence for further exploration of CHPS hydrogels as a cost-effective, simple, and accessible strategy for enhancing the clinical treatment of chronic wounds in diabetic patients.

Herein, variable valence states Mn was adopted to regulate Ru-NC, which serves as a model to reduce the localization of Ru 4d structure and stimulate facile charge transfer, achieving accelerated surface reconstruction to generate Ru‒O active ingredient with high active to acidic water oxidation. Doping Mn not only accelerate surface reconstruction, but also improves durability by eliminating Ru peroxidation due to Mn-buffered charge compensation. The enhancement of OER activity results from the Mn and O induced Ru spin states to change from intermediate spin to low spin, thereby weakening the interaction with *O intermediates, and promoting *OH adsorption，which benefits the initial step of OER.

As promising non-noble candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), NiFe-based layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) has been proven to transform into its high-oxidation-state Ni/Fe oxyhydroxide, which act as the primary active sites. However, advancing the emergence of high-oxidation-state Ni/Fe oxyhydroxide during OER process currently remains a challenge. Herein, a novel 2D NiFe-LDH/stanene p-n junction catalyst is achieved by inserting stanene between NiFe LDH and Ni foam. Time-dependent Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations (DFT) confirm that stanene not only benefits for the construction of built-in electric field, but also serves as an electron absorber to induce a directed electron transport from Ni, Fe to Sn, which thus facilitates the surface reconstruction to form the catalytically active NiOOH. Consequently, an ultralow OER overpotential (230 mV) at 100 mA cm-2 is achieved, corresponding to a considerable decrease of 22.3 % and 42.1 % compared with the individual NiFe-LDH and stanene, respectively.

Water electrolysis is a promising strategy for hydrogen production but the major hindrance lies in the inherently sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a potential OER catalyst with hollow nanostructure is designed and fabricated, which is composed of highly dispersed mixed metal phosphide (CoP/Ni2P/Fe2P) nanoparticles encapsulated in the mesoporous carbon nanoboxes (denoted as CoNiFeP@C NBs). Beneficial from abundant CoP/Ni2P/Fe2P interfaces in these nanoparticles, the electronic structure would be optimized and thus decrease the catalytic energy barrier. Furthermore, the porous hollow carbon layer can not only promote electron and mass transport but also expose more active sites and prevent aggregation of active CoNiFeP units. Owing to the structural and compositional advantages including the suitable electronic structure, promoted charge and mass transfer capability, and massive electrochemical catalytic active sites, the optimized CoNiFeP@C NBs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance towards OER. Typically, an overpotential of 260 mV is achieved for CoNiFeP@C NBs at 10 mA cm−2 with a low Tafel slope of 65.5 mV dec−1, which is among the top values of the reported Co-based OER electrocatalysts and even outperform commercial RuO2. Impressive stability is also realized in alkaline electrolyte due to the protective carbon layer. This work paves the way for developing advanced OER catalyst towards high catalytic capability and remarkable stability.

The synthesis of nanoscale porous coordination network (PCN-224 MOF) is intricate due to the difficulty in spatially influencing typical soluble metal salt chemicals, leading to the formation of bulk MOFs. This study presents the novel utilization of V2CTx as a metal precursor for the preparation of PCN-224 MOF nanostructures, with the ability to modulate the resulting nanostructure by adjusting the reaction temperature. The growth of PCN-224 provides the surface atoms with strong electronegative in V2CTx MXene and the availability of abundant accessible active sites for ligands. This study introduces a novel methodology for fabricating a composite material by integrating V2CTx MXene and PCN-224 MOF. The PCN-224/V2CTx supercapattery have 185.5C/g specific capacity (Qs) at 2 A/g and an electrode with 82 Wh/kg and 840 W/kg energy density (Ed) and power density (Pd). The electrode exhibited a coulombic efficiency and capacitive retention of 96 % and 82 % after undergoing 15,000 cycles. It has outstanding cyclic stability, maintaining 94 % of charge time and 97 % discharge time after 15,000 cycles. This study suggests using duplicate cell electrodes of PCN-224/V2CTx supercapattery in daily-use portable devices and oxygen evaluation reaction (OER) investigation. This is the first study to examine PCN-224/V2CTx electrochemical behavior and propose high-energy, high-rate electrochemical devices use it as an electrode.

Abstract Ruthenium oxide is currently considered as the promising alternative to Ir‐based catalysts employed for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers but still faces the bottlenecks of limited durability and slow kinetics. Herein, a 2D amorphous/crystalline heterophase ac‐Cr 0.53 Ru 0.47 O 2‐δ substitutional solid solution with pervasive grain boundaries (GBs) is developed to accelerate the kinetics of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and extend the long‐term stability simultaneously. The ac‐Cr 0.53 Ru 0.47 O 2‐δ shows a super stability with a slow degradation rate and a remarkable mass activity of 455 A g Ru −1 at 1.6 V vs RHE, which is ≈3.6‐ and 5.9‐fold higher than those of synthesized RuO 2 and commercial RuO 2 , respectively. The strong interaction of Cr–O–Ru local units in synergy with the specific 2D structural characteristics of ac‐Cr 0.53 Ru 0.47 O 2‐δ dominates its enhanced stability. Meanwhile, high‐density GBs and the shortened Ru‐O bonds tailored by amorphous/crystalline structure and Cr–O–Ru interaction regulate the adsorption and desorption rates of oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the overall acidic OER kinetics.

Abstract Isolated metal-coordinated nitrogen embedded carbon (M-N-C) materials are potential alternatives to noble catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the activity of metal centers can be further modulated by adjusting the coordination environment. Recently, experimental studies have shown that the aggregation of metal atoms into small clusters or particles is inevitable during the high temperature pyrolysis, while the influences of metal clusters on the OER activity of single metal atoms in M-N-C are unclear. Herein, taking Ni-based single atom as examples, the interaction characters of NiN4 doped graphene (NiN4-graphene) with different Ni clusters were studied. The modulation effects of Ni clusters to the NiN4-graphene were systematically investigated from the geometric configurations, electronic structures, and the OER activity of the Ni single atom. It was found that the OER&#xD;performance of NiN4-graphene can be remarkably improved through the addition of Ni clusters, and the lowest overpotential of 0.43 V is achieved on NiN4-graphene with the modification of Ni13 cluster, which is smaller than that of 0.69 V on NiN4-graphene. Electronic properties calculations showed that the charge transfer from Ni clusters to NiN4-graphene will alter the density of states of Ni single atom near the Fermi level, which promotes the charge transfer from NiN4-graphene to oxygen containing products and optimizes the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediate to close to the ideal adsorption free energy of 2.46 eV by enhancing the hybridization interaction between the O-p orbitals and the Ni-dxz, Ni-dyz orbitals, and finally leading to an enhanced OER activity. The current findings highlight the important role of metal clusters on improving the catalytic performance of M-N-C materials, which benefits for the rational design of M-N-C catalysts with high catalytic activity.

Intermediates in the overall water splitting on particulate photocatalysts were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap. In situ EPR spectra under ultraviolet light showed the exclusive formation of a hydroxyl radical adduct (•DMPO-OH) over Ga2O3 and NaTaO3:La without a Rh–Cr oxide cocatalyst. In contrast, the Rh–Cr oxide cocatalyst-loaded photocatalysts active for water splitting formed a 5,5-dimethyl-2-oxo-pyrroline-1-oxyl radical (•DMPOX). •DMPOX is suggested as an indicator of the surface peroxyl radical intermediate (M-OO•) in the oxygen evolution reaction pathway.

In this work, non-peripherally tetra 3-(4-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)phenoxy) substituted nickel(II) phthalocyanine (NiPc), cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc), zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc), copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and lead(II) phthalocyanine (PbPc) were synthesized. The structural characterization of the novel compounds was performed by a combination of instrumental methods. The electrochemical and in-situ spectroelectrochemical responses of the compounds were recorded and redox properties were illuminated. Graphitic carbon nitride(g-C3N4) was synthesized by thermal decomposition of urea and combined with metallophthalocyanines to avoid agglomeration of phthalocyanine, to obtain homogeneous microstructured catalyst and to provide synergistic effects between pyridinic N-metal bonds of g-C3N4 and metallophthalocyanines (MPcs). The synthesized compounds were electropolymerized onto g-C3N4 thanks to piperazin substitute groups. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of g-C3N4/Poly-MPcs was investigated in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). The g-C3N4/Poly-NiPc exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance with low overpotential and Tafel slope, respectively, 380 mV@ 10 mA cm−2 and 80 mVdec−1, which is superior to the g-C3N4. Moreover, g-C3N4/Poly-NiPc electrocatalyst exhibited ∼100 times higher current density than g-C3N4.

Electrochemical water‐splitting to produce hydrogen is potential to substitute the traditional industrial coal gasification, but the oxygen evolution kinetics at the anode remains sluggish. In this paper, sea urchin‐like Fe doped Ni3S2 catalyst growing on nickel foam (NF) substrate is constructed via a simple two‐step strategy, including surface iron activation and post sulfuration process. The NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2 obtains at temperature of 130 ℃ (NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130) features nanoneedle‐like arrays which are vertically grown on the particles to form sea urchin‐like morphology, features high electrochemical surface area. As oxygen evolution catalyst, NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130 exhibits excellent oxygen evolution activities, fast reaction kinetics, and superior reaction stability. The excellent OER performance of sea urchin‐like NF‐Fe‐Ni3S2‐130 is mainly ascribed to the high‐vertically dispersive of nanoneedles and the existing Fe dopants, which obviously improved the reaction kinetics and the intrinsic catalytic properties. The simple preparation strategy is conducive to establish high‐electrochemical‐interface catalysts, which shows great potential in renewable energy conversion.

The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for many renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. However, the high energy required to break the strong covalent O-H bond of H2O in acidic media results in sluggish OER kinetics. Here, we report the critical role of iron in a new family of iron-containing yttrium ruthenate (Y2-xFexRu2O7-δ) electrocatalysts in highly increasing the electrophilicity of surface oxygen, leading to a significant reduction of the kinetics barrier by 33%, thus an exceptional OER mass activity of 1,021 A · g Ru − 1 up to 12.4 and 7.7 times that of Y2Ru2O7-δ and RuO2, respectively. Introducing iron reduces the Mulliken atomic charge on the O sites in the generated Ru-O-Fe structure, thereby facilitating the acid-base nucleophilic assault from H2O and reducing the free energy on the rate-determining step of OER. This work provides an effective strategy to reduce the kinetics barrier to achieve highly efficient and economic OER in acidic conditions.

Nanotubes constructed from methylene-bridged cycloparaphenyleneas (MCPPs) are investigated using density functional theory. The dynamical stability is indicated by the real vibrational frequencies of the infrared spectra. MCPPs are semiconductors with an energy gap of ∼ 2.9 eV that significantly decreases in the finite nanotubes. This decrease is a result of the interactive molecular orbitals that are localized at the pentagonal rings linking MCPPs. The UV-vis spectra show that transitions from the highest occupied and neighbor orbitals to the lowest unoccupied orbital dominate the primary absorption peaks. Oxygen evolution reaction shows that all the reaction intermediates, HO, O, and HOO are adsorbed by the pentagonal active sites. The considered nanotubes show good catalytic performance but the best performance is observed in the wider nanotubes with an overpotential of 0.10 V. This remarkably low overpotential in addition to the abundant active sites makes finite nanotubes from MCPPs exceptional catalysts for oxygen evolution.

Hydrogen has recently attracted a lot of attention as a clean as well as sustainable energy source. However, the vast bulk of industrial hydrogen is produced by converting natural gas into hydrogen. One of the primary goals of large-scale electrolysis is to find efficient, cost-effective, stable, and many other catalysts capable of producing hydrogen from water with minimal electrical bias. Using readily available electrocatalysts on Earth to facilitate the oxidation of water is one way to get closer to an effective method of splitting water to produce hydrogen. Here in the present work, CuWO4 was coated on the conducting polypyrrole (PPy) polymer via hydrothermal techniques to boost its catalytic performance. The fabricated PPy/CuWO4 composite is then utilized for water splitting to yield hydrogen in addition to oxygen. The PPy is able to raise the CuWO4 Fermi levels are separated, as a result, the PPy/CuWO4 produced a large number of strong and readily accessible charges, which led to the splitting of water into hydrogen, and demonstrated that at a potential of 1.470 V vs. RHE, the current density intended for CuWO4-3/PPY reached 10 mAcm−2, attaining an overpotential of 197 mV, with a Tafel plot slope of about 34.4 mVdec−1, and also with a charge transfer resistance of 2.3Ω for OER. Furthermore, the HER activity also attained lower overpotential (250 mV), with a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec−1 in order to reach a 10 mAcm−2 current density. In addition, the CuWO4 is completely encased by the PPy, facilitating charge transfer, allowing the particles to travel rapidly to the polymer's surface. Hence, this study demonstrates that the highly effective CuWO4-3/PPy nanocomposite is responsible for future energy-related applications.

Noble metal electrocatalysts are highly preferred for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis cell (PEMWE) due to their exceptional catalytic activity and stability. This study proposes a novel thin electrode (NTE) design to enhance the performance of noble metal electrocatalysts for the OER in PEMWE. The NTE utilizes a thin porous transport layer for the direct deposition of Iridium (Ir). Unlike conventional gas diffusion electrodes with deep porous structures that underutilize the catalyst due to limited triple-phase boundary conditions, the flat NTEs with straight-through pores overcome this restriction. The paper compares two deposition methods, electroplating and sputter coating. The in-situ electrochemical properties of NTEs with varying Ir loadings (0.06–1.01 mg cm−2) are investigated. The electroplated NTE demonstrates excellent mass activity, achieving 5.05 A mg−1 at 1.6 V and 80 °C. The NTE exhibits a simple fabrication process and low cost while significantly improving catalyst mass activity. Additionally, the NTE reduces electrode thickness from hundreds of micrometers to only 25 μm. This concept holds great promise for the future advancement of compact and high-efficiency PEMWE electrodes, resulting in reduced cost, volume, and mass of both the electrode itself and the overall system.

Abstract Developing efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional electrocatalysts is attractive for rechargeable metal–air batteries. Meanwhile, single metal atoms embedded in 2D layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) have become a very promising catalyst. Recently, many attentions have been paid to the 2D ReS 2 electrocatalyst due to its unique distorted octahedral 1T’ crystal structure and thickness‐independent electronic properties. Here, the catalytic activity of different transition metal (TM) atoms embedded in ReS 2 using the density functional theory is investigated. The results indicate that TM@ReS 2 exhibits outstanding thermal stability, good electrical conductivity, and electron transfer for electrochemical reactions. And the Ir@ReS 2 and Pd@ReS 2 can be used as OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalysts with a lower overpotential for OER (η OER ) of 0.44 V and overpotentials for ORR (η ORR ) of 0.26 V and 0.27 V, respectively. The excellent catalytic activity is attributed to the optimal adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates coming from the effective modulation of the electronic structure of ReS 2 after Ir/Pd doping. The results can help to deeply understand the catalytic activity of TM@ReS 2 and develop novel and highly efficient OER/ORR electrocatalysts.
