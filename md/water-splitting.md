The construction of solar‐to‐chemical conversion system by mimicking the photosynthetic network of the chloroplast holds great promise on efficient solar energy utilization. We developed an artificial photosynthetic cell (APC) based on molecular biomimetic thylakoid (CoTPP‐FePy) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2) at low driving voltage (1.1 V) and neutral condition (pH≈7). The CoTPP‐FePy can emulate the light reaction in thylakoids to produce O2 by coupling light harvesting, photocatalysis, and electron/energy storage (FeIII/FeII‐Py). Subsequently, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were employed to simulate the dark reaction, wherein the proton, electron and energy generated by the light reaction can drive the H2 producing process. By a temporally and spatially coupling of the light and dark reactions, the resulting APC achieved a solar conversion efficiency of 3.1%, exceeding that of natural photosynthetic systems and demonstrating the potential of artificial photosynthesis.

Abstract Green hydrogen (H 2 ) is an essential component of global plans to reduce carbon emissions from hard‐to‐abate industries and heavy transport. However, challenges remain in the highly efficient H 2 production from water electrolysis powered by renewable energies. The sluggish oxygen evolution restrains the H 2 production from water splitting. Rational electrocatalyst designs for highly efficient H 2 production and oxygen evolution are pivotal for water electrolysis. With the development of high‐performance electrolyzers, the scale‐up of H 2 production to an industrial‐level related activity can be achieved. This review summarizes recent advances in water electrolysis such as the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). The critical challenges for PEMWE and AEMWE are the high cost of noble‐metal catalysts and their durability, respectively. This review highlights the anode and cathode designs for improving the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts, the electrolyte and membrane engineering for membrane electrode assembly (MEA) optimizations, and stack systems for the most promising electrolyzers in water electrolysis. Besides, the advantages of integrating water electrolyzers, fuel cells (FC), and regenerative fuel cells (RFC) into the hydrogen ecosystem are introduced. Finally, the perspective of electrolyzer designs with superior performance is presented.

Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc‐air batteries (ZABs). High‐valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low‐cost fluorine‐lodged high‐valent high‐entropy layered double hydroxide (HV‐HE‐LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi‐ions co‐precipitation, where F‐ are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O 2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal‐oxygen (M‐O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M‐O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long‐term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three‐phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round‐trip energy efficiency (60.6% at 10 mA cm‐2) and long‐term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8% after 1050 charge‐discharge cycles).

Abstract Zn‐air battery (ZAB)‐driven water splitting holds great promise as a next‐generation energy conversion technology, but its large overpotential, low activity, and poor stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remain obstacles. Here, a trifunctional graphene‐sandwiched, heterojunction‐embedded layered lattice (G‐SHELL) electrocatalyst offering a solution to these challenges are reported. Its hollow core‐layered shell morphology promotes ion transport to Co 3 S 4 for OER and graphene‐sandwiched MoS 2 for ORR/HER, while its heterojunction‐induced internal electric fields facilitate electron migration. The structural characteristics of G‐SHELL are thoroughly investigated using X‐ray absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, atomic‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images align well with the DFT‐relaxed structures and simulated TEM images, further confirming its structure. It exhibits an approximately threefold smaller ORR charge transfer resistance than Pt/C, a lower OER overpotential and Tafel slope than RuO₂, and excellent HER overpotential and Tafel slope, while outlasting noble metals in terms of durability. Ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis under varying potentials by examining the peak shifts and ratios (Co 2+ /Co 3+ and Mo 4+ /Mo 6+ ) elucidates electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, the ZAB with G‐SHELL outperforms Pt/C+RuO 2 in terms of energy density (797 Wh kg −1 ) and peak power density (275.8 mW cm −2 ), realizing the ZAB‐driven water splitting.

Abstract Combining multiple design strategies often enhances catalyst performance but usually comes with high costs and low reproducibility. A technique that enhances catalyst performance in multiple strategies is urgently needed. Herein, a novel bioregulation technique is introduced, allowing simultaneous control over morphology, particle size, doping, interface engineering, and electronic properties. Bioregulation technique utilizes the soluble extracellular polymer from Aspergillus niger as a templating agent to construct high‐performance catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). This technique controls catalyst morphology, introduces biological N and S doping, and regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. Biomolecule modification enhances surface hydrophilicity, and the nanostructure increases surface roughness and gas‐release efficiency. Theoretical calculations show that the bioregulation technique shortens the d/p‐band center, optimizing reaction intermediate adsorption and desorption. The Bio‐Pt/Co 3 O 4 catalyst with trace Pt on the surface, designed with these strategies, achieves HER ( η 10 of 42 mV), OER ( η 10 of 221 mV), and overall water‐splitting performance (1.51 V at 10 mA cm −2 ), maintaining stability for over 50 h, outperforming most Pt‐based catalysts. Notably, using spent lithium‐ion battery cathodes leachate, rich in Co 2 ⁺, successfully replicates the experiment. This approach holds promise as a mainstream method for synthesizing high‐performance materials in the future.

This study aims to explore the n-FeO and p-α-Fe2O3 semiconductor nanoparticles in hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions and a combined full cell electrocatalyst system to electrolyze the water. We have observed a distinct electrocatalytic performance for both HER and OER by tuning the interplay between iron oxidation states Fe2+ and Fe3+ and utilizing phase-transformed iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs). The Fe2+ rich n-FeO NPs exhibited superior HER performance compared to p-α-Fe2O3 and Fe(OH)x NPs, which is attributed to the enhancement in n-type semiconducting nature under HER potential, facilitating the electron transfer for the reduction in H+ ions. In contrast, p-α-Fe2O3 NPs demonstrated excellent OER activity. An H-cell constructed using n-FeO||p-α-Fe2O3 NPs as cathode and anode achieved a cell voltage of 1.87 V at a current density of 50 mA/cm2. The cell exhibited remarkable stability after 30 h of activation and maintained the high current density of 100 mA/cm2 for 80 h with a negligible increase in cell voltage. This work highlights the semiconducting properties of n-FeO and p-α-Fe2O3 for the electrochemical water splitting system using the band bending phenomenon under the applied potential.

Seawater electrolysis is the most promising technology for hydrogen production, in which surface reconstruction on the interface of electrode/electrolyte plays a crucial role in activating the catalytic reactions with a low activation energy barrier. Herein, an efficient Mo modifying NiCoMo prickly flower clusters electrocatalyst supported on nickel foam (Mo-doped Ni/Co-OOH prickly flower clusters) is obtained, which serves as an eminently active and durable catalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the surface reconstruction during the alkaline seawater electrolysis with ultralow overpotentials. It just requires a cell voltage of 1.52 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm

As COVID-19 profoundly affected nations worldwide, there was a significant reduction in gas and electricity consumption, contrasting with the surplus production of oil and gas by companies. This situation has ignited a growing interest in researching alternative green fuels. Electrochemical water-splitting has emerged as a promising avenue for advancing the green hydrogen economy. However, the high costs associated with traditional catalysts have hindered the feasibility of this remarkable method on an industrial scale. Here, this study mainly objects to fabricating an efficient, low cost and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst and our focus has been on refining the morphology to enhance activity levels.

Abstract Lithium‐oxygen (Li‐O 2 ) battery is considered a high‐energy alternative to Li‐ion one due its characteristic electrochemical conversion process, with the additional advantage of lower cost and environmental impact. However, this emerging battery still requires an enhancement of stability and lifespan to allow its use as a practical energy storage system. In this work we investigate an electrode material benefitting of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), few layer graphene (FLG), and gold nano‐powder catalyst to improve the Li‐O 2 battery performances in terms of energy efficiency, cycle life and stability. Morphological, structural, and electrochemical tests indicate that the composite electrode can actually boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and enhance the Li‐O 2 process reversibility, with a capacity of 1000 mAh g −1 over 70 cycles. On the other hand, the tests reveal the role of the gold in decreasing the polarization and increasing the cell life. Therefore, the results suggest the combination of carbons with various morphologies as a suitable architecture for hosting the Li‐O 2 reaction products and allowing their reversible reaction. On the other hand, the results highlight the necessity for a better tuning the noble metal characteristics to further enhance the cell performances.

Solar‐driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water‐splitting cells coupled with a photovoltaic (PV) cell as a photoanode have become an intriguing topic in solar energy conversion. In this study, for the purpose of developing a system with high efficiency, several photoanode materials were investigated to adjust the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) energy bands. Among all, MAPbBr 3 with a wide bandgap (2.3 eV) was selected. However, the power conversion efficiency of the PV cell was not desirable due to the low light absorption. Therefore, the NiO–GeSe core–shell was placed inside the perovskite layer to enhance light absorption and carrier generation. In order to achieve a cell with the maximum performance, the core–shell height, and the shell radius were optimized, where the optimum structure was recognized with a core–shell height of 300 nm and a radius of 25–60 nm. The system’s total efficiency, which is represented by the solar to hydrogen efficiency, was then increased from 5.49% to 19.74% for the planar and nanostructure photoanode, respectively. The proposed PEC cell with the optimized photoanode is considered as the most efficient half‐tandem and perovskite‐based reported coupled system, operating without the need for an external voltage. In this study, three optical, electrical, and electrochemical models were solved using the finite element method to analyze the coupled system.

The use of ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) as a novel additive in the refractory industry is becoming increasingly popular. However, the synthesis of such materials is associated with some commercial obstacles, mainly high-temperature synthesis methods. In the present study, the pyro-vacuum method is presented as a new method to decrease the final product's synthesis temperature and oxygen content. Some thermodynamic aspects and phase evolution of the materials during the synthesis procedure are described for the synthesis of non-oxide material. Conclusively, it seems that by applying vacuum conditions, the final UHTC phases can be synthesized at significantly lower temperatures (>400 °C lower, for ZrC), if adequate powder mixtures are considered. Also due to phase analysis, it was found that the oxygen content of the final phase is lower than the conventional routes and other references. The process provides promising prospects for the economic synthesis of UHTCs.

Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials gain increasing attention as water splitting photocatalysts for hydrogen production. We use first-principles calculations to predict a stable 2D Janus $T$-TiNBr structure, with strong near-ultraviolet sunlight absorption and band edges that align favorably with the water redox potentials for oxygen and hydrogen evolution. We show that the optical and electronic properties of $T$-TiNBr can be modulated to a certain extend by applying external uniaxial strain. Explicit calculations of the redox reactions reveal that solar-driven water splitting is viable at the N-side of $T$-TiNBr, while the Br-side requires modifications such as vacancy creation, the application of an external potential, or adjustment of the pH conditions.

Abstract In this study, the siphon‐type composite vertical flow constructed wetland (Sc‐VSsFCW) was constructed with anthracite and shale ceramsite chosen as the substrate bed materials. During the 90‐day experiment, typical pollutant removal effects of wastewater and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) accumulation were investigated. Meanwhile, X‐ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the phase composition and surface morphology to analyze adsorptive property. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of siphon effluent on clogging and depolymerization by measuring the EPS components' evolution within the system. The findings reveal that both the anthracite and shale ceramsite systems exhibit impressive removal efficiencies for total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 + ‐N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 − ‐N). However, as the experiment progressed, TP removal rates in both systems gradually declined because of the saturation of adsorption sites on the substrate surfaces. Although the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels remained relatively stable throughout the experiment, pH exhibited distinct patterns, suggesting that the anthracite system relies primarily on chemical adsorption, whereas the shale ceramsite system predominantly utilizes physical adsorption. After an initial period of fluctuation, the permeability coefficient and porosity of the system gradually stabilized, and the protein and polysaccharide contents in both systems exhibited a downward trend. The study underscores that anthracite and shale ceramsite have good effectiveness in pollutant removal as substrate materials. Overall, the hydraulic conditions of the double repeated oxygen coupling siphon in the Sc‐VSsFCW system contribute to enhanced re‐oxygenation capacity and permeability coefficient during operation. The changes in EPS content indicate that the siphon effluent exerts a certain depolymerization effect on the EPS within the system, thereby mitigating the risk of biological clogging to a certain extent. Practitioner Points The system can still maintain good pollutant treatment effect in long‐term operation. The re‐oxygenation method of the system can achieve efficient and long‐term re‐oxygenation effect. The siphon effluent has a certain improvement effect on the permeability coefficient and porosity, but it cannot effectively inhibit the occurrence of clogging. The EPS content did not change significantly during the operation of the system, and there was a risk of biological clogging.

Nitrogen is important in planetary evolution because it is essential to life and the most abundant element in Earth’s atmosphere. Here, we investigate how core formation affects the distribution of N within accreting terrestrial planets. We conducted laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments (LH-DAC) over a wide range of high pressure-temperature-compositional (PTX) conditions (38-103 GPa, 2728-5609 K, -1.95 to -1.03 ∆IW, 0.5-3.7 NBO/T) to study nitrogen partitioning in metal-silicate systems. Combining our data with existing low and high PT results, we developed a nitrogen partitioning model applicable from early accretion to extreme PT stages associated with giant impacts. We test the robustness of our model by accurately predicting nitrogen partitioning in a multi-anvil experiment conducted independently at 15 GPa, 2573 K with oxygen fugacity of -2.5 ∆IW. Our model shows that increasing pressure, oxygen fugacity, and N concentration in the alloy make nitrogen more siderophile, while increasing temperature, oxygen and silicon contents in the alloy, and the SiO2 content of the silicate melt make nitrogen less siderophile. Application of our model to core formation conditions under oxidized and reduced scenarios suggest that nitrogen can be siderophile or lithophile under low PT conditions but exhibits a neutral partitioning at high PT conditions (&gt; 100 GPa, 5000 K) over a wide range of bulk planet compositions. Using our model, along with partitioning models for S and C, we examine how core formation scenarios can fractionate C/N and S/N ratios in the BSE. Our model suggests that backreaction of volatile rich cores from reduced, smaller impactors (sub-Mars-sized) within deep magma oceans can impart a wide range of C/N and S/N ratios on the magma ocean. We find that the amount of silicate entrainment has a strong control on elemental fractionations imparted to the magma oceans. Elevated C/N and S/N ratios are associated with larger degrees of silicate entrainment, and vice versa. Thus, Earth’s apparent depletion of N may relate to its volatiles being reprocessed within deep magma oceans, possibly during the end stages of accretion.
