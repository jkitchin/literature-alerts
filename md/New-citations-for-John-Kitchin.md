Since the kinetic barrier posed by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a significant obstacle in water-splitting systems, the creation of effective and inexpensive OER electrocatalysts has received considerable research interest. We report the facile synthesis of an amorphized NiFeSn oxyhydroxide wet gel on Ni foam via a gelation-induced embedding method. Its intrinsic pore structure provided a sufficiently large surface area without the need for a binder. The NiFeSn oxyhydroxide wet-gel electrocatalyst only needed overpotentials of 253, 301, and 346 mV to produce 100, 200, and 300 mA·cm-2, respectively, for the OER and an overpotential value of 198 mV at 50 mA·cm-2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, an exceptionally low voltage of 1.55 V was required for overall water splitting under alkaline conditions. Enhancement of the catalytic properties of the oxyhydroxide by adding Sn was confirmed by using density functional theory calculations. The nanoporous multi-metallic wet gel can be used to create effective low-cost stable self-supporting electrocatalysts with a high current density for enhanced water electrolysis.

Density functional theory calculations employing a hybrid implicit/explicit solvation method were used to explore a new strategy for electrochemical conversion of CO2 using an electro-organocatalyst. A particular structural motif is identified that consists of an electron-rich vicinal enediamine (>N–C═C–N<) backbone, which is capable of activating CO2 by the formation of a C–C bond while subsequently facilitating the transfer of electrons from a chemically inert cathode to ultimately produce formaldehyde. Unlike transition metal-based electrocatalysts, the electro-organocatalyst is not constrained by scaling relations between the formation energies of activated CO2 and adsorbed CO, nor is it expected to be active for the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The rate-limiting steps are found to occur during two proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) sequences and are associated with the transfer of a proton from a proton transfer mediator to a carbon atom on the electro-organocatalyst. The difficulty of this step in the second PCET sequence necessitates an electrode potential of −0.85 V vs RHE to achieve the maximum turnover frequency. In addition, it is postulated that the electro-organocatalyst should also be capable of forming long-chain aldehydes by successively carrying out reductive aldol condensation to grow the alkyl chain one carbon at a time.    

    

## Impact of Potential and Active-Site Environment on Single-Iron-Atom-Catalyzed Electrochemical CO2 Reduction from Accurate Quantum Many-Body Simulations

Single iron atoms supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe–N–C) have shown promise in catalyzing electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with low overpotential and high selectivity. However, the nature of its rate-limiting step and the effect of active-site environment on catalytic activity are still under debate. Previous theoretical studies exclusively rely on density functional theory (DFT), but their predictions are limited by inherent errors in DFT functionals, leading to diverging conclusions on catalytic mechanisms. Herein, we employ an efficient quantum embedding strategy to enable high-level coupled-cluster (CCSD(T)) simulations of the thermodynamics of Fe–N–C-catalyzed CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and its competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Our calculations accurately predict experimental CO binding energy, onset potential, and potential of maximal Faradaic efficiency (FE) with FeN4 as the catalytic active site. We find that the thermodynamic-limiting step is the formation of a *COOH intermediate at low overpotential, which becomes CO2 adsorption and CO desorption at higher overpotential. Our simulation reveals that the potential-dependent high selectivity of FeN4 originates from the higher charge capacity of *COOH compared to *H. Furthermore, our calculations elucidate distinct roles of active-site environments, including vacancy defect and nitrogen doping. Particularly, graphitic nitrogen doping simultaneously lowers the CO2RR onset potential and allows a wider potential range for high CO FE. This work highlights the importance of robust many-body quantum chemical simulations in achieving quantitative understanding of multistep electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms.

Abstract Efficient and affordable price bifunctional electrocatalysts based on transition metal oxides for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions have a balanced efficiency, but it remains a significant challenge to control their activity and durability. Herein, a trace Ru (0.74 wt.%) decorated ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets (≈4 nm) supported on the surface of nickel foam (Ru/CoOOH@NF) is rationally designed via an electrochemically induced strategy to effectively drive the electrolysis of alkaline overall water splitting. The as‐synthesized Ru/CoOOH@NF electrocatalysts integrate the advantages of a large number of different HER (Ru nanoclusters) and OER (CoOOH nanosheets) active sites as well as strong in‐suit structure stability, thereby exhibiting exceptional catalytic activity. In particular, the ultra‐low overpotential of the HER (36 mV) and the OER (264 mV) are implemented to achieve 10 mA cm −2 . Experimental and theoretical calculations also reveal that Ru/CoOOH@NF possesses high intrinsic conductivity, which facilitates electron release from H 2 O and H‐OH bond breakage and accelerates electron/mass transfer by regulating the charge distribution. This work provides a new avenue for the rational design of low‐cost and high‐activity bifunctional electrocatalysts for large‐scale water‐splitting technology and expects to help contribute to the creation of various hybrid electrocatalysts.

Electric currents have the intriguing ability to induce magnetization in nonmagnetic crystals with sufficiently low crystallographic symmetry. Some associated phenomena include the non-linear anomalous Hall effect in polar crystals and the nonreciprocal directional dichroism in chiral crystals when magnetic fields are applied. In this work, we demonstrate that the same underlying physics is also manifested in the electronic tunneling process between the surface of a nonmagnetic chiral material and a magnetized scanning probe. In the paramagnetic but chiral metallic compound Co 1/3 NbS 2 , the magnetization induced by the tunneling current is shown to become detectable by its coupling to the magnetization of the tip itself. This results in a contrast across different chiral domains, achieving atomic-scale spatial resolution of structural chirality. To support the proposed mechanism, we used first-principles theory to compute the chirality-dependent current-induced magnetization and Berry curvature in the bulk of the material. Our demonstration of this magnetochiral tunneling effect opens up an avenue for investigating atomic-scale variations in the local crystallographic symmetry and electronic structure across the structural domain boundaries of low-symmetry nonmagnetic crystals.

Abstract Single‐atom‐based catalysts are intriguing electrocatalytic platforms that combine the advantages of molecular catalysts and conductive carbon‐based materials. In this work, hybrids (Co‐NrGO‐1 and Co‐NrGO‐2) were generated by wet‐reactions between organometallic complexes (Co(CH 3 COO) 2 and Co[CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 CH(C 2 H 5 )COO] 2 , respectively) and N‐doped reduced graphene oxide at 25°C. Various characterizations revealed the formation of atomically dispersed Co(O) 4 (N) species in Co‐NrGO‐2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations explained the effect of the aliphatic C7 group in Co2 on the formation processes. The Co‐NrGO‐2 hybrid showed excellent catalytic performance, such as onset (0.94 V) and half‐wave (0.83 V) potentials, for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Co‐NrGO‐2 outperformed Co‐NrGO‐1, which was explained by more back donation to the antibonding orbitals of O 2 from electron‐rich aliphatic groups. DFT calculations support this feature, with mechanistic investigations showing favored ORR reactions and facile breakage of double bonds in O 2 .

Abstract Water splitting is a critical process for the production of green hydrogen, contributing to the advancement of a circular economy. However, the application of water splitting devices on a large scale is primarily impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Thus, developing and designing efficient OER catalysts is a significant target. NiFe‐based catalysts are extensively researched as excellent OER electrocatalysts due to their affordability, abundant reserves, and intrinsic activities. However, they still suffer from long‐term stability challenges. To date, few systematic strategies for improving OER durability have been reported. In this review, various advanced NiFe‐based catalysts are introduced. Moreover, the OER stability challenges of NiFe‐based electrocatalysts in alkaline media, including iron segregation, structural degradation, and peeling from the substrate are summarized. More importantly, strategies to enhance OER stability are highlighted and opportunities are discussed to facilitate future stability studies for alkaline water electrolysis. This review presents a design strategy for NiFe‐based electrocatalysts and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzers to overcome stability challenges in OER, which also emphasizes the importance of long‐term stability in alkaline media and its significance for achieving large‐scale commercialization.

The iron(III) complexes [Fe(H2O)n(OH)m]3−m (n + m = 5, 6, m ≤ 3) and corresponding proton transfer reactions are studied with total energy calculations, the nudged elastic band (NEB) method, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using ab initio and a modification of reactive force field potentials, the ReaxFF-AQ potentials, based on the implementation according to Böhm et al. [J. Phys. Chem. C 120, 10849–10856 (2016)]. Applying ab initio potentials, the energies for the reactions [Fe(H2O)n(OH)m]3−m + H2O → [Fe(H2O)n−1(OH)m+1]2−m + H3O+ in a gaseous environment are in good agreement with comparable theoretical results. In an aqueous (aq) or alkaline environment, with the aid of NEB computations, respective minimum energy paths with energy barriers of up to 14.6 kcal/mol and a collective transfer of protons are modeled. Within MD simulations at room temperature, a permanent transfer of protons around the iron(III) ion is observed. The information gained concerning the geometrical and energetic properties of water and the [Fe(H2O)n(OH)m]3−m complexes from the ab initio computations has been used as reference data to optimize parameters for the O–H–Fe interaction within the ReaxFF-AQ approach. For the optimized ReaxFF-AQ parameter set, the statistical properties of the basic water model, such as the radial distribution functions and the proton hopping functions, are evaluated. For the [Fe(H2O)n(OH)m]3−m complexes, it was found that while geometrical and energetic properties are in good agreement with the ab initio data for gaseous environment, the statistical properties as obtained from the MD simulations are only partly in accordance with the ab initio results for the iron(III) complexes in aqueous or alkaline environments.
