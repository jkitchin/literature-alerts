The interplay between covalent and noncovalent interactions at the solid–liquid interface strongly influences electrocatalytic reactions. Although methods to determine the former interactions have been rigorously developed, the latter are often described with static bilayer models or similarly approximate methods. In this study, we account for the disorder and dynamics at complex electrochemical interfaces by proposing a simple theory to estimate the enthalpy of solvation for adsorbed intermediates. In a strategy reminiscent of Born–Haber cycles, the enthalpy of solvation is expressed in terms of two subprocesses: vacancy creation by water reorganization and adsorbate interaction with solvent molecules. The magnitude of the solvation enthalpy is then determined as a mean valueof hydrated adsorbate-catalyst configurations obtained from simulated annealing with ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations. This theory can be generalized for many combinations of surfaces and adsorbates. Its application improves treatment of energetics at electrified solid–liquid interfaces as well as corresponding structure–activity–stability predictions, as demonstrated for electrochemical oxygen reduction on Pt(111) and on Fe–N–C catalysts and for ethanol electrooxidation on Pt(111).

We present a methodology leveraging machine learning models to generate interatomic potentials for crystalline materials. This approach is rooted in the material’s crystallography in question. Specifically, we tap into the occupied Wyckoff sites, extracting the defining features that encapsulate the atomic local order in the material. Our choice for the target variable is the formation energy per atom, derived from the total energy of the structure’s representative cell. Our machine learning model’s architecture depends on the occupied Wyckoff sites. The diversity of these occupied sites conditions the layering scheme within the model. Atoms occupying a particular Wyckoff site were modeled with the architecture and learning parameters linked to the respective layer. To illustrate our method, we developed an interatomic potential for atomic interactions in α-alumina. For training purposes, we generated the samples through quantum mechanical computations. The evaluation of the learned interatomic potential involved conducting molecular dynamics calculations on a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell, yielding formation energies per atom deviating by less than 1.0 meV from the quantum mechanics results. The methodology described here paves the way for further innovations, potentially ushering in the creation of interatomic potentials that can be utilized for more than one material. Moreover, this approach provides valuable insights into the feasibility of substituting atoms within a compound by focusing exclusively on the specific Wyckoff sites that they occupy.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key half-reaction in fields including water electrolysis, organic synthesis, and water treatment. With the development of the industry, research into highly active and stable oxygen evolution anodes in an acidic environment is essential. DSA is the dimensionally stable anode. Widespread attention has been paid to titanium-based DSAs in the field of acidic oxygen precipitation due to their low overpotential and high acid resistance. The titanium-based anode mainly consists of two parts: catalyst and titanium substrate, where the design of the catalyst is the key to the anode design. The factors affecting the catalytic activity and durability of the titanium-based DSA were heterogeneous and rarely reported. In this paper, the influence of catalytic mechanism and composition design on the catalytic activity and service life of anode is reviewed from the perspective of the catalyst. Then, the current situation related to anode preparation is summarized, and an improvement strategy to enhance the activity and stability of anode is proposed based on the failure mode of titanium-based DSA.

Hydrogen fuel cells have drawn increasing attention as one of the most promising next-generation power sources for future automotive transportation. Developing efficient, durable, and low-cost electrocatalysts, to accelerate the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, is urgently needed to advance fuel cell technologies. Herein, we report on metal–organic frameworks-derived nonprecious dual metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) (Zn/Co–N–C), consisting of Co–N4 and Zn–N4 local structures. These catalysts exhibited superior ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.938 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) and robust stability (ΔE1/2 = −8.5 mV) after 50k electrochemical cycles. Moreover, this remarkable performance was validated under realistic fuel cell working conditions, achieving a record-high peak power density of ∼1 W cm–2 among the reported SACs for alkaline fuel cells. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy was conducted to identify the active sites and reveal catalytic mechanistic insights. The results indicated that the Co atom in the Co–N4 structure was the main catalytically active center, where one axial oxygenated species binds to form an Oads–Co–N4 moiety during the ORR. In addition, theoretical studies, based on a potential-dependent microkinetic model and core-level shift calculations, showed good agreement with the experimental results and provided insights into the bonding of oxygen species on Co–N4 centers during the ORR. This work provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the active sites in the Zn/Co–N–C catalysts and will pave the way for the future design and advancement of high-performance single-site electrocatalysts for fuel cells and other energy applications.

Photoreduction of CO2 and H2O into fuels and value-added chemicals is a promising green technology for solar-to-chemical conversion. However, improving the conversion efficiency with regulated product selectivity is a big challenge due to the sluggish dynamic transfer and insufficient active sites. Herein, we report on Pt single atoms anchored porous C3N4 nanosheet photocatalyst (Pt1@CN) with Pt–N4 coordination for stable and efficient CO2 photoreduction using H2O as reductant. The Pt1@CN exhibits an evolution rate of 84.8 μmol g−1 h−1 with nearly 100% CO selectivity, outperforming most previous C3N4-based single-atom photocatalysts. Experimental and DFT calculation results reveal that the Pt–N4 coordinated active sites promote the photogenerated electron transfer, CO2 adsorption/activation, *COOH generation, and *CO desorption, thus accounting for the significantly improved CO2 photoreduction activity with ∼100% CO selectivity. This study provides a deep insight into the significant roles of single-atom active sites in enhancing the CO2 photoreduction activity and regulating the product selectivity.

Development of effective transition metal catalyst to alternate precious metal platinum (Pt) based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has attracted wide interest recently. HER through electrochemical water splitting (EWS) is a green pathway to generate hydrogen (H2) fuel without any carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. However, this technology has been restricted dependency on platinum (Pt)-based catalyst to achieve optimum performance. At present, Pt based catalyst serves as a benchmark material in electrochemical H2 production. Extensive studies have been conducted on new type of porous materials metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) due to the Pt-based catalysts scarcity and cost. In this review, we have discussed the latest advancements of MOFs, which encompass transition metals (TMs), graphene, and MXenes. MOF-based electrocatalysts synthesis methods and electrochemical characteristics are also briefly summarized. Scientists can embark on further exploration of the capabilities offered by MOF-based catalysts by expanding the progress achieved and acknowledging the hurdles that remain. Consequently, their efforts can significantly contribute to the advancement of next-generation technologies for energy storage and conversion.

Exploring high-performance and cost-effective materials for electrochemical applications to meet eco-friendly and sustainable energy demands remain as an urgent need all the time. Large specific surface area and robust chemical activity endow two-dimensional (2D) materials with the potential as excellent candidates for electrochemical applications. Herein, we systematically study the 2D morphology for the Co-P system via advanced structural search and identify a series of stable monolayers, such as CoP, Co2P, and Co3P2. Detailed first-principle calculations reveal that these monolayers showcase inherent metallicity which benefits boosting the electrochemical process. For hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), the activity of CoP could reach 54 meV, which is comparable to that of Pt. As anode material potassium-ion batteries, CoP exhibits a suitable open circuit voltage and high capacity to store metal ion. This work disclosed the possible multifunctional applications for CoxPy monolayers and provided some theoretical guidance in designing electrocatalysts and anode materials from 2D transition-metal materials used in electrochemical processes.

This work evaluates the feasibility of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using Pt single-atoms (1.0 wt %) on defect-rich ceria (Pt1/CeOx) as an active and stable dual-site catalyst. The catalyst displayed a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope in an alkaline medium. Moreover, Pt1/CeOx presented a high mass activity and excellent durability, competing with those of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt %). In this picture, the defective CeOx is active for water adsorption and dissociation to create H* intermediates, providing the first site where the reaction occurs. The H* intermediate species then migrate to adsorb and react on the Pt2+ isolated atoms, the site where H2 is formed and released. DFT calculations were also performed to obtain mechanistic insight on the Pt1/CeOx catalyst for the HER. The results indicate a new possibility to improve the state-of-the-art alkaline HER catalysts via a combined effect of the O vacancies on the ceria support and Pt2+ single atoms.

Alkaline water electrolysis is a sustainable way to produce green hydrogen using renewable electricity. Even though the rates of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less under alkaline conditions than under acidic conditions, the possibility of using non-precious metal catalysts makes alkaline HER appealing. We identify a novel and facile route for substantially improving HER performance via the use of commercially available NiTi shape memory alloys, which upon heating undergo a phase transformation from the monoclinic martensite to the cubic austenite structure. While the room-temperature performance is modest, austenitic NiTi outperforms Pt (which is the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalyst) in terms of current density by ≤50% at 80 °C. Surface ensembles presented by the austenite phase are computed with density functional theory to bind hydrogen more weakly than either metallic Ni or Ti and to have binding energies ideally suited for HER.

The integration of transition metal (TM) atoms into two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has been identified as a promising strategy for enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. However, the vast combinatorial space presents challenges for rapid catalyst screening. In response, high-throughput calculations were conducted on Ti2CO2 and Zr2CO2 doped with a wide array of TM single atoms. The local structural and corresponding electronic structural changes were analyzed, with an emphasis on their implications for HER performance. Furthermore, universal electronic descriptors were developed using the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) method, harmonizing the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) trends across different MXenes substrates doped with TM atoms. These descriptors enabled the prediction of Cr, Fe, Ru, Pd, Os, and Ir as effective dopants for optimizing the ΔGH* of Hf2CO2, resulting in a reduction of ΔGH* from 1.082 eV to within ± 0.2 eV. Our work not only highlights the potential of these TM dopants in significantly enhancing the catalytic activity of MXenes but also underscores the value of universal electronic structure descriptors in rapidly identifying and developing high-performance HER catalysts.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as a valuable oxidant, has been extensively used in environmental applications. In the past decade, the electrochemical two-electron water oxidation reactions (2e− WOR) process have attracted considerable interest as a promising route to realize the decentralized production of H2O2. Nonetheless, a systematic review regarding the rational design strategies for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis systems through the 2e− WOR is still scarce, which is essential for advancing this burgeoning field. Hence, the basic knowledge of WOR, including the reaction mechanism, theoretical calculation prediction, and catalytic performance evaluation indicators, is introduced at the beginning of this review. Next, the different design strategies of catalysts and reaction medium modulation for H2O2 production by the 2e− WOR route are critically discussed and reviewed. Ultimately, some significant perspectives are proposed on the challenges and opportunities of 2e− WOR for H2O2 generation based on recent advances.

Glucose from plants or food industry wastes is a cost-effective hole scavenger for photocatalytic water splitting, but the related H2 evolution rate is always restricted by the fast recombination of photo electron-hole pairs and the poor intrinsic activity of traditional Pt cocatalysts. Herein, we fabricated Au-Pt heterostructure cocatalyst that consist of one ∼3 nm Au core and several ∼1 nm Pt islands on ultrathin g-C3N4 through one-pot photo-deposition. The heterostructure exhibited superior H2 evolution activity to monometallic Au or Pt nanoparticles. Our experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the enhanced activity was caused by the synergistic effect between Au and Pt, rather than the well-known plasmonic effect of Au. The heterostructure not only favored the trapping of photo electrons from g-C3N4, but also had suitable adsorption strength of H*, exhibiting high intrinsic activity towards H2 evolution. Our research provides a strategy to boost photocatalytic H2 evolution by regulating the synergy of bimetallic cocatalysts.

Water-splitting electrocatalysis has gained increasing attention as a promising strategy for developing renewable energy in recent years, but its high overpotential caused by the unfavorable thermodynamics has limited its widespread implementation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design catalytic materials with outstanding activity and stability that can overcome the high overpotential and thus improve the electrocatalytic efficiency. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based and/or derived materials are widely used as water-splitting catalysts because of their easily controlled structures, abundant heterointerfaces and increased specific surface area. Herein, some recent research findings on MOFs-based/derived materials are summarized and presented. First, the mechanism and evaluation parameters of electrochemical water splitting are described. Subsequently, advanced modulation strategies for designing MOFs-based/derived catalysts and their catalytic performance toward water splitting are summarized. In particular, the correlation between chemical composition/structural functionalization and catalytic performance is highlighted. Finally, the future outlook and challenges for MOFs materials are also addressed.

Achieving composition tunability and structure editability of nanoalloys with high level strain may be an efficient strategy to remarkably boost catalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic water oxidation. Herein, lotus root-like RuIr alloys with native micro-strain were constructed by an epitaxial growth of Ru-richened hcp-(0001) branches on Ir-richened fcc-(111) seeds using a polyol thermal synthesis strategy. The resultant Ru60Ir40 alloy shows an OER overpotential of 197 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 46.59 mV dec−1, showing no obvious activity decay for 80 h continuous chronopotentiometry test in 0.5 M H2SO4. The related characterizations including X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that that the remarkably improved activity of the lotus root-like alloy can be attributed to the (0001) facet-triggered strain, which can efficiently optimize the electronic band structure of the active metal and the weakening of the chemisorption of oxygen-containing substances to boost OER electrocatalysis. Therefore, this work provides a new strategy to designing a class of advanced electrocatalysts with high strain using diverse nanostructures as building materials for carbon-free clean energy conversion systems.

We present a method, including tool support, for bibliometric mining of trends in large and dynamic research areas. The method is applied to the machine learning research area for the years 2013 to 2022. A total number of 398,782 documents from Scopus were analyzed. A taxonomy containing 26 research directions within machine learning was defined by four experts with the help of a Python program and existing taxonomies. The trends in terms of productivity, growth rate, and citations were analyzed for the research directions in the taxonomy. Our results show that the two directions, Applications and Algorithms, are the largest, and that the direction Convolutional Neural Networks is the one that grows the fastest and has the highest average number of citations per document. It also turns out that there is a clear correlation between the growth rate and the average number of citations per document, i.e., documents in fast-growing research directions have more citations. The trends for machine learning research in four geographic regions (North America, Europe, the BRICS countries, and The Rest of the World) were also analyzed. The number of documents during the time period considered is approximately the same for all regions. BRICS has the highest growth rate, and, on average, North America has the highest number of citations per document. Using our tool and method, we expect that one could perform a similar study in some other large and dynamic research area in a relatively short time.

Hydrogen production using an electrochemical cell might be an alternative to conventional fuel systems (i.e., fossil fuels). The NiFe-layered hydroxide (NiFeOxHy) is one of the most popular electrocatalysts for water-splitting applications. However, its electrochemical activity is limited in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of its minimal active sites and modest charge transfer rates. To overcome the limitations in NiFeOxHy, silver sulfide (Ag2S) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were added as heterostructure cocatalysts. The heterostructure cocatalyst (Ag2S/g-C3N4) addition in NiFeOxHy is found to improve the electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) seven times greater than that of pristine NiFeOxHy. The addition of the heterostructure cocatalyst in the NiFeOxHy sample enables hydrogen production with a minimum overpotential of η10 = 43 mV and Tafel slope of 131 mV/dec in saline water conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the heterostructure cocatalyst effectively donates electrons to NiFeOxHy, which enhance the resultant charge transfer ability of the electrocatalyst. In addition, the density functional theoretical (DFT) analysis suggests that the exposed sulfur (S) sites within the Ag2S/g-C3N4 heterostructure cocatalyst serve as the prominent catalytic center for H* interactions. This study highlights the alteration of charge transfer dynamics in NiFeOxHy via heterostructure cocatalyst addition as an effective way to facilitate enhanced alkaline and saline water reduction.

Protic dimeric ionic liquid (IL) 9′9’-(butane-1, 4-diyl)bis (3,4,6,7,8,9-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido [1,2-a]pyrimidin-1-ium) 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4-nonafluorobutane-1-sulfonate (D-HTBD) has been developed as a surface modifier to a PtCo/C oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Thermal properties, intrinsic conductivity, and viscosity were studied to understand the ionic liquid's protonation effect. The protic IL was incorporated into the PtCo/C catalyst and its effect on MEA performance at various humidities were evaluated and compared with pristine PtCo/C catalyst. Electrochemically active surface area, AC impedance and gas diffusion resistance of the MEAs with IL were compared with the PtCo/C catalyst without modification by IL. Besides promoting the oxygen reduction reaction activity of the PtCo/C catalyst, the protic dimeric IL enhances dry condition MEA performance significantly, attributed to the hydrogen bonds between the Brønsted acids and Brønsted bases. A durability study of the PtCo/C catalyst with and without IL shows the reduction of catalyst degradation after incorporating IL. This work suggests that the protic dimeric IL could be a promising modifier to enhance ORR catalyst activity, fuel cell performance and durability.

Direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using oxygen and water through the photocatalytic route is a prospective approach for the on-site production of H2O2. However, the limited varieties of photocatalytic sites and ambiguous structure-active relationship impede the development of environmentally friendly technology. Herein, we report a active compound (benzotrithiophene, BTT) for the photosynthesis of H2O2 using oxygen and water, and design four benzotrithiophene-based 2D covalent organic frameworks (BTT-COFs) linked with aromatic amines linkers. Significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity has been observed via the introduction of BTT struct into 2D COFs. The high crystallinity of COFs increases the visible light absorption ability and photostability of BTT. The suitable distance of BTT struct in COFs and the construction of donor–acceptor (D-A) structure further promote the carrier generation and transfer. The COF-BTT-TAPT exhibited the highest H2O2 production rate of 620 μmol g−1 h−1. Mechanism investigation experiments have given the validation that BTT-COFs efficiently reduce oxygen in pure water to form H2O2 under visible-light irradiation. This work paves a revolutionary way for designing and fabricating high-performance metal-free photocatalysts for visible-light-driven H2O2 production.

ZrCo and its alloys have attracted extensive attention as promising hydrogen isotope storage materials for nuclear fusion reactors. However, ZrCo can be readily poisoned by carbonaceous impurity gases like CO2 and CO introduced by input hydrogen isotopes or produced during the fusion reactor operation procedure. In this work, with density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, the poisoning effects of CO2 and CO are identified by predominantly occupying active sites on the metal surface when reaching equilibrium. Surface reaction events related to CO2 are mostly molecular adsorption–desorption steps due to its strong binding strength. Dissociation of CO occurs readily even at room temperature, and the resident time length for the coverage of hydrogen being higher than other species is longer than CO2, indicating that the ZrCo alloy is more resistant to CO-poisoning compared to CO2. Interaction between CH4 and ZrCo is not active with the coexistence of hydrogen, making this impurity inert in deteriorating hydrogen storage performance. Hydrogen isotope effects are characterized by comparing reactions among H2 + CO2(CO), D2 + CO2(CO), and T2 + CO2(CO) mixing gases, with hydrogen resident time lengths decreasing from H2 to T2.

Abstract Ammonia is an essential commodity in the food and chemical industry. Despite the energy‐intensive nature, the Haber–Bosch process is the only player in ammonia production at large scales. Developing other strategies is highly desirable, as sustainable and decentralized ammonia production is crucial. Electrochemical ammonia production by directly reducing nitrogen and nitrogen‐based moieties powered by renewable energy sources holds great potential. However, low ammonia production and selectivity rates hamper its utilization as a large‐scale ammonia production process. Creating effective and selective catalysts for the electrochemical generation of ammonia is critical for long‐term nitrogen fixation. Single‐atom alloys (SAAs) have become a new class of materials with distinctive features that may be able to solve some of the problems with conventional heterogeneous catalysts. The design and optimization of SAAs for electrochemical ammonia generation have recently been significantly advanced. This comprehensive review discusses these advancements from theoretical and experimental research perspectives, offering a fundamental understanding of the development of SAAs for ammonia production.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is an environmentally benign technology for large-scale hydrogen production. Despite many catalysts being developed to replace Pt, successful development of low-cost catalysts that meet the balance of performance and durability is limited. In this work, atomically dispersed Ru on Ni catalyst-integrated porous transport electrodes were fabricated by a simple electrodeposition. With a trace amount of Ru (< 0.05 mgRu·cm−2), the Ni98.1Ru1.9 cathode catalyst exhibited an overpotential of 35 mV at –10 mA·cm−2 with excellent stability. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the high performance was driven by optimized adsorption strength and improved mobility of hydrogen on the catalyst surface. The Ni98.1Ru1.9 electrode was further verified in a PEMWE cell and resulting performance (6.0 A·cm−2 at 2.25 Vcell) and stability (0.13 mV·h−1 decay rate at 1 A·cm−2) surpassed previously reported non-Pt and even Pt electrodes, demonstrating its readiness as an advanced cathode to replace Pt.

Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (ECR) powered by renewable energy has the potential to utilize the intermittent renewable electric energy, alleviate the problem of excessive CO2 emissions and yield high value-added chemicals. Despite the intrinsic activity of the well-designed catalysts, subtle changes in the electrode–electrolyte interface will have a significant impact on the overall reaction. The electrode and its microenvironment together determine the ECR performance. Revealing the relationship between the microenvironment of the catalyst-electrolyte interface and the ECR performance is critical for explaining the reaction mechanism and controlling the reaction process accurately. To maximize the catalytic performance includes the activity, selectivity and stability, the fundamental understanding of the interfacial microenvironment should be clarified as important as the intrinsic properties of the catalyst. Researches on the microenvironment in ECR have been gradually launched while the comprehensive discussion is scarcely. In this review, the interfacial microenvironment changes affected by multiple influence factors including the electrolyte effects (cation effect, anion effect, local pH, electrolyte type and concentration), morphological effects (tip effect, confinement effect), catalyst surface modification (surface hydrophobicity, chemical and electronic state) and electrolyzers improvement (gas diffusion electrode, membrane electrode reaction microenvironment control) are illustrated. Finally, some perspectives are offered on the basis of understanding the connection of catalytic activity and the interfacial microenvironment, these insights obtained can be applied for better control the CO2 reduction and rational design reactors.

The focus of this chapter is on the breakdown of ammonia intending to produce hydrogen as the cleanest source of energy. A review of microreactors and related technical literature is first collected. Then, the chemical mechanism of two coupled reactions (combustion and decomposition) are discussed. These two reactions are essentially underway in the same coupled microchannels. An autothermal plug-flow reactor for NH3 decomposition is a type of chemical reactor that utilizes a catalytic process to convert ammonia (NH3) into nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2). This reaction is important in the production of hydrogen for fuel cells, as well as in the removal of ammonia from industrial waste streams. The autothermal plug-flow reactor is particularly useful for this reaction because it allows for both exothermic and endothermic reactions to occur simultaneously, without the need for external heating or cooling. The reactor design includes an annular region on the outside of a microchannel containing the catalyst, which allows for efficient heat transfer and mass transfer. The main effective parameters for this type of reactor include temperature, pressure, flow rate, catalyst type and loading, reactant concentration, reactor geometry, and inlet temperature and composition. By optimizing these parameters, the efficiency, selectivity, and yield of the NH3 decomposition reaction can be improved.

Electrowinning-coupled competitive separation (ECCS) CO2 capture technology, utilizing renewable electricity as the energy input, is regarded as a promising electrochemically mediated CO2 capture approach to substitute for the traditional solvent-based CO2 scrubbing method. However, this technology is still distant from practical application due to its energy-intensive property, sensitivity to oxygen, amine degradation, and system complexity. The selection of a suitable solvent plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the ECCS system. To address an efficient solvent screening method, this paper proposed a systematic comparison of solvents in terms of thermodynamics, electrochemistry, absorption, and desorption performance. The proposed solvent screening method undergoes a critical evaluation through the development of a thermodynamic model and experimentation. Using MEA, EDA, and NH3 as examples (solvents extensively discussed in the ECCS system), the paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the solvent screening method. Results indicate that EDA exhibits superior CO2 absorption and thermodynamic performance. NH3 solvent demonstrates better CO2 desorption and electrochemical performance. However, there is an antithetical relationship between the thermodynamic and electrochemical performance. This phenomenon arises because the Cu2+–solvent complex, characterized by a stronger coupling performance, is more stable, necessitating a higher potential to reduce the Cu2+–solvent complex. This leads to increased energy consumption during the solvent regeneration process. Therefore, when solvent screening is conducted, it is essential to categorize and thoroughly consider thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and absorption and desorption performance.
