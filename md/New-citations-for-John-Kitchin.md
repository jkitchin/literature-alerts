Catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs) relies fundamentally on the electronic nature and local coordination environment of the active site. Here, based on a machine-learning (ML)-aided density functional theory (DFT) method, we reveal that the intrinsic dipole in Janus materials has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of SACs, using 2D γ-phosphorus carbide (γ-PC) as a model system. Specifically, a local dipole around the active site is a key degree to tune the catalytic activity and can be used as an important descriptor with a high feature importance of 17.1% in predicting the difference of adsorption free energy (ΔGO* – ΔGOH*) to assess the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, the catalytic performance of SACs can be tuned by an intrinsic dipole, in stark contrast to those external stimuli strategies previously used. These results suggest that dipole engineering and the revolutionary DFT-ML hybrid scheme are novel approaches for designing high-performance catalysts.

Abstract Effective therapeutic strategies for myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain elusive. Targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS) provides a practical approach to mitigate myocardial damage following reperfusion. In this study, we synthesize an antioxidant nanozyme, equipped with a single-Platinum (Pt)-atom (PtsaN-C), for protecting against I/R injury. PtsaN-C exhibits multiple enzyme-mimicking activities for ROS scavenging with high efficiency and stability. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the excellent ROS-elimination performance of the single Pt atom center precedes that of the Pt cluster center, owing to its better synergistic effect and metallic electronic property. Systematic in vitro and in vivo studies confirm that PtsaN-C efficiently counteracts ROS, restores cellular homeostasis and prevents apoptotic progression after I/R injury. PtsaN-C also demonstrates good biocompatibility, making it a promising candidate for clinical applications. Our study expands the scope of single-atom nanozyme in combating ROS-induced damage and offers a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of I/R injury.

Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting seems to be an efficient strategy to deal with increasingly serious environmental problems and energy crises but still suffers from the lack of stable and efficient electrocatalysts. Designing practical electrocatalysts by introducing defect engineering, such as hybrid structure, surface vacancies, functional modification, and structural distortions, is proven to be a dependable solution for fabricating electrocatalysts with high catalytic activities, robust stability, and good practicability. This review is an overview of some relevant reports about the effects of defect engineering on the electrocatalytic water splitting performance of electrocatalysts. In detail, the types of defects, the preparation and characterization methods, and catalytic performances of electrocatalysts are presented, emphasizing the effects of the introduced defects on the electronic structures of electrocatalysts and the optimization of the intermediates' adsorption energy throughout the review. Finally, the existing challenges and personal perspectives of possible strategies for enhancing the catalytic performances of electrocatalysts are proposed. An in‐depth understanding of the effects of defect engineering on the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts will light the way to design high‐efficiency electrocatalysts for water splitting and other possible applications.

Methanol is a liquid energy carrier that has the potential to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Industrial production of methanol is currently a multistep high-temperature/high-pressure synthesis route. Direct conversion of methane to methanol under low-temperature and low-pressure conditions is an interesting but challenging alternative, which presently lacks suitable catalysts. Here, the complete reaction cycle for direct methane-to-methanol conversion over transition-metal dimers in the chabazite zeolite is studied by using density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling. In particular, a reaction mechanism previously identified for the Cu2 dimer is explored under dry and wet conditions for dimers composed of Ag, Au, Pd, Ni, Co, Fe, and Zn and the bimetallic dimers AuCu, PdCu, and AuPd. The density-functional-theory-based microkinetic modeling shows that Cu2, AuPd, and PdCu dimers have reasonable turnover frequencies under technologically relevant conditions. The adsorption energy of atomic oxygen is identified as a descriptor for the reaction landscape as it correlates with the adsorption and transition-state energies of the other reaction intermediates. Using the established scaling relations, a volcano plot of the rate is generated with its apex close to the Cu2, AuPd, and PdCu dimers.

Developing bifunctional oxygen electrode materials with superior activity for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions is essential for advancing regenerative fuel cell and rechargeable metal–air battery technologies. This present work deals with the synthesis and characterization of electrocatalysts containing Pt and Ni nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped mixed metal oxides (Mn2O3-NiO) and the systematic evaluation of their bifunctional ORR/OER performance in an alkaline medium. These electrocatalysts have been successfully synthesized by a simple and fast microwave method. PtNi/Mn2O3-NiO-N with a binary metal oxide-to-N ratio of 1:2 demonstrated the best performance among the studied materials regarding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity (∆E = 0.96 V) and robust stability.

The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a highly intended strategy of producing ammonia. However, several drawbacks, such as the weak adsorption energy of the N2 molecules on catalyst surfaces, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the low catalytic activity and selectivity of the used electrocatalysts, make it challenging to increase the NH3 production yield and the Faradaic efficiency (FE). The single-atom electrocatalyst (SAC) is a new category of 0 D nanoparticles that received great attention in the electrocatalysis field and showed satisfactory performance for the NRR. This chapter provides a brief insight into the recent progress of the experimental and theoretical investigations of NRR on SACs, FE, mechanism pathways, and HER suppression. Besides, the origin of the activity, stability, and selectivity of the SACs toward NRR are discussed. Finally, the challenges for the fabrication of new efficient materials are provided.

Abstract Research institutions across the globe attempt to change the academic publishing system as digitization opens up new opportunities, and subscriptions to the large journal bundles of the leading publishers put library budgets under pressure. One approach is the negotiation of so-called transformative agreements. I study the ‘DEAL’ contracts between nearly all German research institutions and Springer Nature and Wiley. I investigate 6.1 million publications in 5,862 journals covering eight fields in the years 2016–2022 and apply a causal difference-in-differences design to identify whether the likelihood of a paper appearing in an eligible journal increases. The effect strongly depends on the discipline. While material science, chemistry, and economics s tend to hift towards these journals, all other disciplines in my sample do not react. Suggestive evidence hints at the market position of the encompassed publishers before the ‘DEAL’ was established: Springer Nature and Wiley appear to benefit more from the contracts in disciplines in which they possessed a higher market share ex ante. The transformative vigor of these agreements in terms of publication behavior seems to be limited. It and highlights that the developments in this intertwined market require further examination.

Dealloyed nanoporous platinum (np-Pt) alloy electrocatalysts are advantageous owing to the lower Pt content in the alloy composition, nanoporous architecture with high electrochemically active surface area, and excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability. Chemical, electrochemical or other dealloying methods help to develop commercially relevant np-Pt alloys. Selection of the appropriate precursor alloy composition, dealloying solution concentration and time, and the number and nature of dealloying steps are essential to optimize the desirable properties. We comprehensively review the available information on dealloyed Pt and its binary, ternary, quaternary and high-entropy alloys, nanoparticles and composites. The review presents various Pt alloy types and their dealloying conditions and the current understanding of the mechanism of electrocatalysis at the nanoporous confined spaces. The origin and the factors contributing to the electrocatalytic activity of dealloyed nanoporous electrocatalysts are discussed. The collective information could assist researchers in deriving more efficient and durable dealloyed electrocatalysts in various electrochemical energy applications.

Here, we present a study combining Bayesian optimization structural inference with the machine learning interatomic potential Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potential (NequIP) to accelerate and enable the study of the adsorption of the conformationally flexible lignocellulosic molecules β-d-xylose and 1,4-β-d-xylotetraose on a copper surface. The number of structure evaluations needed to map out the relevant potential energy surfaces are reduced by Bayesian optimization, while NequIP minimizes the time spent on each evaluation, ultimately resulting in cost-efficient and reliable sampling of large systems and configurational spaces. Although the applicability of Bayesian optimization for the conformational analysis of the more flexible xylotetraose molecule is restricted by the sample complexity bottleneck, the latter can be effectively bypassed with external conformer search tools, such as the Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool, facilitating the subsequent lower-dimensional global minimum adsorption structure determination. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the described approach to find adsorption structures practically equivalent to the density functional theory counterparts at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) from water splitting is a promising technology for clean and renewable energy production. Elemental crystalline red phosphorus (CRP) is purposefully designed and developed for PHE reaction. However, the photocatalytic activity of CRP is limited by its intrinsic P vacancy (V P ) defects, which lead to detrimental charge trapping at deep states and hence its severe recombination. To address this issue, a boron (B) incorporated CRP (B‐CRP) photocatalyst is tailored, synthesized via a simple and mild boric acid‐assisted hydrothermal strategy. The incorporation of B effectively fills the V P defects, reducing deep trap states (DTS) and introducing beneficial shallow trap states (STS) within the band structure of CRP. This defect engineering approach leads to enhanced photocatalytic activity, with B‐CRP achieving a PHE rate of 1392 µmol g −1 h −1 , significantly outperforming most reported elemental photocatalysts in the literature. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and ultrafast spectroscopy support the constructive role of B‐dopant‐induced STS in prolonging active charge carrier lifetimes, promoting more efficient photocatalytic reactions. The findings not only demonstrate the effectiveness of B‐CRP as a photocatalyst but also highlight the usefulness of dopant‐induced STS in advancing PHE technologies.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximized metal atom utilization and intriguing properties are of utmost importance for energy conversion and catalysis science. However, the lack of a straightforward and scalable synthesis strategy of SACs on diverse support materials remains the bottleneck for their large-scale industrial applications. Herein, we report a general approach to directly transform bulk metals into single atoms through the precise control of the electrodissolution–electrodeposition kinetics in ionic liquids and demonstrate the successful applicability of up to twenty different monometallic SACs and one multimetallic SAC with five distinct elements. As a case study, the atomically dispersed Pt was electrodeposited onto Ni 3 N/Ni-Co-graphene oxide heterostructures in varied scales (up to 5 cm × 5 cm) as bifunctional catalysts with the electronic metal–support interaction, which exhibits low overpotentials at 10 mA cm −2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 30 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 263 mV) with a relatively low Pt loading (0.98 wt%). This work provides a simple and practical route for large-scale synthesis of various SACs with favorable catalytic properties on diversified supports using alternative ionic liquids and inspires the methodology on precise synthesis of multimetallic single-atom materials with tunable compositions.

Abstract Efficient oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts are essential for sustainable clean energy conversion. However, catalytic materials followed the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) with the inherent scaling relationship between key oxygen intermediates *OOH and *OH, or the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) with the possible lattice oxygen migration and structural reconstruction, which are not favorable to the balance between high activity and stability. Herein, we propose an unconventional Co-Fe dual-site segmentally synergistic mechanism (DSSM) for single-domain ferromagnetic catalyst CoFeS x nanoclusters on carbon nanotubes (CNT) (CFS-ACs/CNT), which can effectively break the scaling relationship without sacrificing stability. Co 3+ (L.S, t 2g 6 e g 0 ) supplies the strongest OH* adsorption energy, while Fe 3+ (M.S, t 2g 4 e g 1 ) exposes strong O* adsorption. These dual-sites synergistically produce of Co-O-O-Fe intermediates, thereby accelerating the release of triplet-state oxygen ( ↑ O = O ↑ ). As predicted, the prepared CFS-ACs/CNT catalyst exhibits less overpotential than that of commercial IrO 2 , as well as approximately 633 h of stability without significant potential loss.

Exploring electrocatalysts for the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) has emerged as a promising strategy to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance the kinetics in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. A comprehensive understanding of the electrocatalytic mechanism within Li–S batteries remains elusive, which hinders the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for these systems. In this study, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have been investigated for the catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) using density functional theory (DFT). Our findings reveal that MXenes show a moderate binding affinity for LiPSs, suggesting favorable thermodynamics for their role as electrocatalysts for the SRR. This thermodynamic favorability promotes the suppression of the LiPSs’ shuttle effect and the enhancement of the SRR kinetics. The SRR process in Li–S batteries consists of multiple steps with varying activation energies. Our analysis by constructing the energy diagram for the multistep SRR indicates that the initial reduction of S8 to Li2S8 is facile with a lower activation energy, while the last step where Li2S2 converts to Li2S appears to be a rate-limiting step. To predict the catalytic abilities of MXene structures, we built a volcano-shaped relationship between the adsorption of LiPSs and catalytic activity. We show three MXenes─Ta2CO2, Zr2NO2, and Mo2NO2 as potential electrocatalysts that exhibit lower thermodynamic overpotentials for the SRR. These findings represent a significant step toward developing advanced electrocatalysts that may unlock the full potential of Li–S batteries, paving the way for improved energy storage systems with enhanced efficiency and performance.

In recent data-driven approaches to material discovery, scenarios where target quantities are expensive to compute and measure are often overlooked. In such cases, it becomes imperative to construct a training set that includes the most diverse, representative, and informative samples. Here, a novel regression tree-based active learning algorithm is employed for such a purpose. It is applied to predict the band gap and adsorption properties of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of materials that results from the virtually infinite combinations of their building units. Simpler and low dimensional descriptors, such as those based on stoichiometric and geometric properties, are used to compute the feature space for this model owing to their ability to better represent MOFs in the low data regime. The partitions given by a regression tree constructed on the labeled part of the data set are used to select new samples to be added to the training set, thereby limiting its size while maximizing the prediction quality. Tests on the QMOF, hMOF, and dMOF data sets reveal that our method constructs small training data sets to learn regression models that predict the target properties more efficiently than existing active learning approaches, and with lower variance. Specifically, our active learning approach is highly beneficial when labels are unevenly distributed in the descriptor space and when the label distribution is imbalanced, which is often the case for real world data. The regions defined by the tree help in revealing patterns in the data, thereby offering a unique tool to efficiently analyze complex structure–property relationships in materials and accelerate materials discovery.
