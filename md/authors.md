Open access: False
    
[John R. Kitchin](https://openalex.org/A5003442464), [Kirby Broderick](https://openalex.org/A5088846020), Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research). None(None)] 2024.https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10501343.
    
Data are split into train (<=35-atom slabs) and test (60-atom slabs) folders. Each folder contains a VASP calculation without the POTCAR. The slabs used are disordered AgAuCu, AuCuPd, or CuPdPt fcc alloys with a lattice constant set randomly between the largest and smallest experimental lattice constants of the constituent elements. The PBEsol functional is used with D3 dispersion corrections.
