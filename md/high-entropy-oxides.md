The advancement of water electrolyzer technologies and the production of sustainable hydrogen fuel heavily rely on the development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High entropy ceramics, characterized by their unique properties, such as lattice distortion and high configurational entropy, hold significant promise for catalytic applications. In this study, we utilized the sol–gel autocombustion method to synthesize high entropy ceramics containing a combination of 3d transition metals and aluminum ((AlCrCoNiFe2)O). We then compared their electrocatalytic performance with other series of synthesized multimetal and monometallic oxides for the OER under alkaline conditions. Our electrochemical analysis revealed that the high entropy ceramics exhibited excellent performance and the lowest charge transfer resistance, Tafel slope (29 mV·dec–1), and overpotential (η10 = 230 mV). These remarkable results can be primarily attributed to the high entropy effect induced by the addition of Al, Cr, Co, Ni, and Fe, which introduces increased disorder and complexity into the material's structure. This, in turn, facilitates more efficient OER catalysis by providing diverse active sites and promoting optimal electronic configurations for the reaction. Furthermore, the strong electronic interactions among the constituent elements in the metallic spinels further enhance their catalytic activity in the initiation of the OER process. Combined with the reduced charge transfer resistance, these factors collectively play pivotal roles in enhancing the OER performance of the electrocatalysts. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the design and development of high-performance electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications. By harnessing the high entropy effect and leveraging strong electronic interactions, electrocatalytic materials can be tailored to improve efficiency and stability, thus advancing the progress of clean energy technologies.
