High‐entropy oxides (HEOs) are an emerging class of materials whose compositional complexity has garnered attention because of their tailorable chemistries and unique properties arising from extreme configurational entropy. Solid‐state methods are often employed to synthesize HEOs, but such methods result in poor material properties for catalytic processes, leaving HEOs less studied for catalysis. Here we utilize different wet‐synthesis strategies to produce porous HEOs and investigate their performance in heterogeneous CO2 hydrogenation to methane. Specifically, HEOs were synthesized using hydrothermal, co‐precipitation, and solvothermal methods, resulting in different morphologies like platelets or spheres. Of the tested materials, HEOs with 2‐D platelets derived from hydrothermally‐synthesized high‐entropy layered double hydroxides had superior catalytic performance, especially in low‐temperature regimes (<300°C). K‐edge XANES indicated that metallic sites (Ni0‐Co0) were formed during the reaction, and these metallic sites are dispersed into the HEO matrix which is confirmed by STEM/elemental mapping. This facile synthesis approach allows for realized synergy between the metallic sites and the HEO support, leading to superior performance for CO2 methanation compared to low‐entropy counterparts. Finally, this study illustrates how HEOs offer new avenues of tailorability in terms of the interplay between support, active site and reaction temperatures for heterogeneous catalysis.
