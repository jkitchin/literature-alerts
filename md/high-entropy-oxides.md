Abstract Mesoporous single crystals have received more attention than ever in catalysis-related applications due to their unique structural functions. Despite great efforts, their progress in engineering crystallinity and composition has been remarkably slower than expected. In this manuscript, a template-free strategy is developed to prepare two-dimensional high-entropy oxide (HEO) nanoplates with single-crystallinity and penetrated mesoporosity, which further ensures precise control over high-entropy compositions and crystalline phases. Single-crystalline mesoporous HEOs (SC-MHEOs) disclose high electrocatalytic performance in 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) for efficient biomass upgrading, with remarkable HMF conversion of 99.3% and superior 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) selectivity of 97.7%. Moreover, with nitrate reduction as coupling cathode reaction, SC-MHEO realizes concurrent electrosynthesis of value-added FDCA and ammonia in the two-electrode cell. Our study provides a powerful paradigm for producing a library of novel mesoporous single crystals for important catalysis-related applications, especially in the two-electrode cell.
