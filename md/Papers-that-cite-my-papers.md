Abstract As a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) has emerged as a versatile tool in accelerating catalytic materials discovery because of its ability to find complex patterns in high‐dimensional data. While the intricacy of cutting‐edge ML models, such as deep learning, makes them powerful, it also renders decision‐making processes challenging to explain. Recent advances in explainable AI technologies, which aim to make the inner workings of ML models understandable to humans, have considerably increased our capacity to gain insights from data. In this study, taking the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on {111}‐oriented Pt monolayer core–shell catalysts as an example, we show how the recently developed theory‐infused neural network (TinNet) algorithm enables a rapid search for optimal site motifs with the chemisorption energy of hydroxyl (OH) as a single descriptor, revealing the underlying physical factors that govern the variations in site reactivity. By exploring a broad design space of Pt monolayer core–shell alloys ( candidates) that were generated from thermodynamically stable bulk structures in existing material databases, we identified novel alloy systems along with previously known catalysts in the goldilocks zone of reactivity properties. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals the important role of adsorbate resonance energies that originate from ‐band interactions in chemical bonding at metal surfaces. Extracting physical insights into surface reactivity with explainable AI opens up new design pathways for optimizing catalytic performance beyond active sites.

Abstract The advancement of photocatalysis relies on the development of novel hetero-structured materials with unique architectures. In this study, we successfully synthesized a hetero-structured g-C 3 N 4 (GCN) material with a distinctive surface modification. To further enhance its photocatalytic performance, we optimized the Ag-Ni concentration to maximize the active sites for hydrogen evolution reactions. By using systematic physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the pivotal role of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) in facilitating the formation of an efficient charge transfer channel and promoting the effective generation and separation of photo-generated carriers. From the DFT calculations, we also demonstrated that the Ag-Ni nanoparticles provide more efficient active sites than Ni nanoparticles for water splitting and hydrogen evolution and In-situ TEM exploration. Furthermore, the hetero microstructure consisting of thin g-C 3 N 4 nano scrolls has a crucial role in shortening the migration distance of the carriers, effectively suppressing carrier recombination. Consequently, these extraordinary characteristics resulted in a superior solar light-driven photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate of 2507 µmol h − 1 g − 1 , surpassing the rate achieved by bulk g-C 3 N 4 by a remarkable 18.6-folds. Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency of this hetero-structured material reached an exceptional value of 1.6% under a 1.5 G air mass filter.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting to produce green hydrogen offers a promising technology for renewable energy conversion and storage, as well as realizing carbon neutrality. The efficiency, stability, and cost of electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrocatalytic overall water splitting (EOWS) at large current densities are essential for practical application. In this review, the key factors that determine the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts at large current densities are summarized from the angel of thermodynamic and kinetic correlation. The corresponding design strategies are presented. The electronic structure and density of active sites that affect the adsorption/desorption of intermediates are considered as the thermodynamic aspects, while charge transfer and mass transport capabilities closely associated with electrode resistance and intermediate diffusion are assigned as kinetic effects. Recent development of bifunctional and integrated electrocatalysts toward EOWS is also discussed in detail. Finally, the perspective and direction on the electrocatalytic water splitting under large current density are proposed. This comprehensive overview will offer profound insights and guidance for the continued advancement of this field.

The problem of CO oxidation in incomplete combustion from steel industry is that the deactivation of Pt-based catalysts by SO2. Here, we have elaborately designed a series of Mo-decorated 0.1 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalyst (Pt/Mo/Ti) catalyst. The catalytic test showed that the Pt/3Mo/Ti catalyst achieved 100 % CO conversion above 200 °C and maintained excellent long-term catalytic stability in the presence of SO2. The enhancement in SO2-tolerance ability was due to the suitable Brønsted acidity to weaken the SO2 adsorption and strong charge transfer ability to reduce the oxidation of SO2 to SO3. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) suggests that the Pt-O-Mo species are present in atomically dispersed form in the Pt/3Mo/Ti catalyst. The surface O = MoO4 sites with terminal Mo = O bond prevented SO2 from reacting with platinum, thus inhibiting its migration to TiO2 and TiOSO4 formation. We also revealed the strong interaction between platinum and molybdenum and characterized the CO oxidation pathway in the presence of SO2. This research offers new insights into the mechanism of the catalytic CO oxidation and SO2 resistance over Mo-decorated Pt/TiO2 catalyst.

Hydrogen energy as the alternative to fossil fuel received wide attention. Among different methods of hydrogen production, water electrolysis is the cleanest and most promising method. However, its development is greatly limited by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop low-cost, high activity, and good stability of non-precious metal catalyst to replace the precious metal catalyst (Pt, RuO2), and to further reduce overpotential and power consumption. To date, great efforts have been made to develop transition metal compounds with electrocatalytic performance, such as sulfides, oxides, and carbides materials. Especially, transition metal sulfides play a very important role as catalysts and have attracted wide attention for their structural adjustability, high abundance, and mild preparation process. In this introduction, we focus on the role of transition metal sulfides in catalysts for water electrolysis, especially in a few most studied sulfides such as cobalt/molybdenum based sulfides and the recently reported homogeneous cobalt-molybdenum based sulfides, in which cobalt acts as a key element. Composition, morphology, and size are the most important factors that influence the intrinsic activity, electrical conductivity, and electronic structure of these transition metal sulfides. Besides, the effect of carbon nanomaterials as carrier materials is also discussed. The aim of this review is to emphasize the great potentials of cobalt and molybdenum based sulfides with high performance, and to help improve the performance of existing sulfides and explore new modification methods.

Recently, surface reconstruction derived from Ir-based derivatives could achieve satisfactory oxygen evolution performance. Herein, ultra-long nanowire hollandite structured Rb0.17IrO2 was synthesized and a nano-amorphous layer with a thickness of ∼1.5 nm was achieved by interfacial oxidation treatment. The prepared catalyst exhibits outstanding water oxidation activity with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 330 mV for robust continuous operation in acidic media. Through the spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the nano-amorphous layers induced by interfacial oxidation on the one-dimensional (1D)-nanowire surface have enhanced O-2p centers and increased Ir-O hybridization compared to the bulk Rb0.17IrO2 phase, which essentially balances the adsorption energy of the intermediates. Effectively incorporating surface reconstruction behavior could significantly improve catalyst activity. This work effectively combines 1D Ir-based materials and surface reconstruction, which provides a strategy for the subsequent full utilization of Ir-based materials applied on OER process.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential for the development of excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts, which are key functions in clean energy production. The emphasis of this study lies in the rapid design and investigation of 153 MN4–graphene (Gra)/ MXene (M2NO) electrocatalysts for ORR/OER catalytic activity using machine learning (ML) and density functional theory (DFT). The DFT results indicated that CoN4–Gra/Ti2NO had both good ORR (0.37 V) and OER (0.30 V) overpotentials, while TiN4–Gra/M2NO and MN4–Gra/Cr2NO had high overpotentials. Our research further indicated orbital spin polarization and d-band centers far from the Fermi energy level, affecting the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and thus reducing the catalytic activity. The ML results showed that the gradient boosting regression (GBR) model successfully predicted the overpotentials of the monofunctional catalysts RhN4–Gra/Ti2NO (ORR, 0.39 V) and RuN4–Gra/W2NO (OER, 0.45 V) as well as the overpotentials of the bifunctional catalyst RuN4–Gra/W2NO (ORR, 0.39 V; OER, 0.45 V). The symbolic regression (SR) algorithm was used to construct the overpotential descriptors without environmental variable features to accelerate the catalyst screening and shorten the trial-and-error costs from the source, providing a reliable theoretical basis for the experimental synthesis of MXene heterostructures.

It investigates various environmentally friendly synthesis methods and analyzes the crystal structure of copper oxide under different parameters. Assessing CuO-based catalyst activity in OER and HER under diverse conditions, the study provides a comprehensive overview of their electrocatalytic performance in water splitting. Integrating this knowledge with catalyst developments holds promise for advancing sustainable hydrogen production. The study concludes by discussing future research aspects and pinpointing gaps to guide the development of cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts.

Nitrogen doped leather waste-derived carbon materials have been employed as eletrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. Low current densities and complex synthesis routes of other carbon-based materials limit their practical applicability. We present herein a simple and cost-competitive design of a metal free nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NCM). At 10 mA cm−2 of current density, the assembled NCM showed a low over potential of 330 mV. NCM provided 73 mV dec-1 of slope value according to Tafel analysis, with NCM slope value improved as compared to previously described electrocatalysts inclusive of graphene (113 mV dec−1) and carbon nanosheets (101 mV dec−1), under similar reaction conditions. Linear sweep voltamogram, stability test and electrochemical impedance spectra confirmed the potential of NCM in OER as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst.

Abstract Biodegradable medical implants promise to benefit patients by eliminating risks and discomfort associated with permanent implantation or surgical removal. The time until full resorption is largely determined by the implant's material composition, geometric design, and surface properties. Implants with a fixed residence time, however, cannot account for the needs of individual patients, thereby imposing limits on personalization. Here, an active Fe‐based implant system is reported whose biodegradation is controlled remotely and in situ. This is achieved by incorporating a galvanic cell within the implant. An external and wireless signal is used to activate the on‐board electronic circuit that controls the corrosion current between the implant body and an integrated counter electrode. This configuration leads to the accelerated degradation of the implant and allows to harvest electrochemical energy that is naturally released by corrosion. In this study, the electrochemical properties of the Fe‐30Mn‐1C/Pt galvanic cell model system is first investigated and high‐resolution X‐ray microcomputed tomography is used to evaluate the galvanic degradation of stent structures. Subsequently, a centimeter‐sized active implant prototype is assembled with conventional electronic components and the remotely controlled corrosion is tested in vitro. Furthermore, strategies toward the miniaturization and full biodegradability of this system are presented.

Abstract Catalysts that can promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are in demand for efficient water splitting. Here, a general and practical UV‐induced synthesis of noble metal catalysts supported on reduced electrochemical graphene oxide (M‐rEGO, M = Ir, Pt or Pd) is proposed. The use of EGO with a low degree of oxidation and the generation of the highly reducing isopropanol radical from added isopropanol and acetone are crucial for this one‐step, one‐pot synthesis. Using Ir as a model material, the vacancies of rEGO allow the interaction of undercoordinated C with Ir, forming multiple active Ir species including single atoms (SAs), dual‐atom pairs (DAs) and nanoparticles. This Ir‐rEGO catalyst exhibits overpotentials of only 42.3 and 294 mV to reach 10 mA cm −2 in 0.5 м H 2 SO 4 for HER and 1 м KOH for OER, respectively, at an extremely low Ir loading (2.1 wt%). The water‐splitting cells featuring Ir‐rEGO catalyst outperform those using commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) and RuO 2 catalysts in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations confirm the stabilization of SAs and DAs at the vacancies of graphene lattice as well as the high activity of DAs in both HER and OER.

Efficient, stable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions have been in demand for decades. Recently, layered transition metals (Co, Mo, Ni, and Fe) and chalcogen compounds (S/Se/Te) gained prominence in catalysis and device studies. Density functional theory identified the covalency of Co and Mo, oxygenated bimetallic selenium bond, crystal structure distortions, and adsorption properties as crucial for enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Hybridizing the Co and Mo d-orbitals around the Fermi level of 0.463 eV improves bonding with metal surface-adsorbate intermediates validated by partial density of states. Oxygenated cobalt molybdenum selenide (O-CoMoSe2) (2 1 0) exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic properties at various active sites, with Gibbs free energy and theoretical overpotential at an active site of Co = 0.086 eV, 0.41 V, and Se = 0.50 V.

Abstract Mo 2 C is an excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, Mo 2 C is a poor electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, two different elements, namely Co and Fe, are incorporated in Mo 2 C that, therefore, has a finely tuned electronic structure, which is not achievable by incorporation of any one of the metals. Consequently, the resulting electrocatalyst Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 –Mo 2 C‐80 displayed excellent OER catalytic performance, which is evidenced by a low overpotential of 214.0 (and 246.5) mV to attain a current density of 10 (and 50) mA cm −2 , an ultralow Tafel slope of 38.4 mV dec −1 , and long‐term stability in alkaline medium. Theoretical data demonstrates that Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 –Mo 2 C‐80 requires the lowest overpotential (1.00 V) for OER and Co centers to be the active sites. The ultrahigh catalytic performance of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the excellent intrinsic catalytic activity due to high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area, large electrochemically active surface area, small Tafel slope, and low charge‐transfer resistance.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on Cu-based catalysts is a promising method for converting anthropogenic CO2 to valuable chemical feedstocks and fuels. Although pure CO2 gas has been widely used as a reactant in CO2RR-related research, CO2 gas collected from the atmosphere inevitably includes some amount of various impurity gases in the actual application of this method. Among such impurities, O2 gas has high reactivity and can easily contaminate the reaction environment, thereby substantially affecting the reactivity of the CO2RR. Herein, we performed first-principles calculations for the CO2RR in the presence of O2 reduction reaction intermediates on the Cu(100) surface. Specifically, we calculated the reaction and activation free energies for the hydrogenation of adsorbed CO* to CHO* on a Cu(100) surface covered with O* or OH*. When the coverage of O* reached 25%, the initial state of CO hydrogenation became destabilized to a greater extent than the transition state, which decreased the reaction and activation free energies by 0.27 and 0.16 eV, respectively. The projected density of states analyses revealed that O* weakens the interaction between CO* and the Cu surface, whereas OH* less strongly affects CO hydrogenation.

Lateral (adsorbate–adsorbate) interactions between adsorbed molecules affect various physical and chemical properties of microporous adsorbents and catalysts, influencing their functional properties. In this work, we studied the hydration of microporous AlPO4-11 aluminophosphate, which has an unusually ordered structure upon adsorption of water vapor, and according to 27Al NMR data, only tetrahedrally or octahedrally coordinated Al sites are present in the AlPO4-11. These 27Al NMR data are consistent with the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations of hydrated AlPO4-11, which revealed the presence of a strong repulsive lateral interaction at the initial stage of adsorption, suppressing the adsorption of water on neighboring (separated by one −O–P–O– bridge) Al crystallographic sites. As a result, of all the different aluminum sites, only half of the Al1 sites adsorb two water molecules and acquire octahedral coordination.
