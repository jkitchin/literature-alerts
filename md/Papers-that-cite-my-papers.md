Abstract Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been a powerful tool to model the corrosion behaviors of materials, provide insights into the corrosion mechanisms, predict the corrosion performance of materials, and design the corrosion‐resistant alloys and organic inhibitors. DFT enables corrosion scientist to fundamentally understand the corrosion behaviors and corrosion mechanisms of materials from the perspective of atomic and electronic structures, combining with the traditional and advanced experimental tests. This review briefly summarizes the main features of DFT calculations and present a comprehensive overview of their typical applications to corrosion and corrosion prevention of metals, involving potential‐pH diagrams, hydrogen evolution reaction, anodic dissolution, passivity and passivity breakdown, and organic inhibitor for metals. The paper also reviews the correlations between DFT‐computed descriptors and the micro/macro physiochemical parameters of corrosion. Despite the great progress achieved by DFT, there are still some challenges in addressing corrosion issues due to the lack of bridges between the DFT‐calculated electronic parameters and the macro corrosion performance of materials. The DFT modeling‐experiment‐engineering‐theory model will be a potential method to clarify and build the links.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting, which encompasses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), offers a promising route for sustainable hydrogen production. The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing this technology, especially given the reliance on expensive transition metals, such as Pt and Ir, in traditional catalysts. This review highlights recent advances in the design and optimization of electrocatalysts, focusing on density functional theory (DFT) as a key tool for understanding and improving catalytic performance in the HER and OER. We begin by exploring DFT-based approaches for evaluating catalytic activity under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The review then shifts to a material-oriented perspective, showcasing key catalyst materials and the theoretical strategies employed to enhance their performance. In addition, we discuss scaling relationships that exist between binding energies and electronic structures through the use of charge-density analysis and d -band theory. Advanced concepts, such as the effects of adsorbate coverage, solvation, and applied potential on catalytic behavior, are also discussed. We finally focus on integrating machine learning (ML) with DFT to enable high-throughput screening and accelerate the discovery of novel water-splitting catalysts. This comprehensive review underscores the pivotal role that DFT plays in advancing electrocatalyst design and highlights its potential for shaping the future of sustainable hydrogen production.

The design of new alloys is a multiscale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically slow and reserved for human experts. Machine learning can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural and chemical features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLMs) and the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multimodal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities. The concerted effort of the multiagent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multiobjective design tasks and opens avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) holds significant potential for converting CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals under mild reaction conditions. The kinetics of CO2RR is strongly influenced by both the electrocatalysts and the local environment at the electrode/electrolyte interface. While considerable research has focused on elucidating the “structure-activity” relationships of electrocatalysts, a fundamental understanding of the role of electrolyte-related factors (such as the ionic species) near the electrode/electrolyte interface is highly important for the further enhancement in the catalytic performance of CO2RR. In this review, we discuss the effects of pH, cations, and anions in the vicinity of the catalyst, using CO2RR as a model reaction. The mechanistic understanding of these effects is also analyzed via experimental findings from in situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical insights from density functional theory simulations. This review underscores the importance of understanding the various interactions of electrolytes with catalyst surfaces or intermediates and their impact on reaction kinetics of CO2RR.

Abstract In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies reveal key insights into the structural and chemical evolution of nanoparticles (NPs) under external stimuli like heating and biasing, which is critical for evaluating their suitability in chemical reactions and their tendency toward forming novel NP systems. In this study, starting from a core@shell Au nanotriangle (AuNT)@Pd nanostructure, the formation of a phase‐separated bi‐metallic Au─Pd NP system at high temperature is reported, despite the fact that Au and Pd are miscible in the entire composition and temperature range. In situ TEM heating of bare AuNT@Pd core@shell structures up to 1000 °C is performed. Between 400 and 800 °C, an initial alloy formation is observed. Notably, higher initial loading of Pd increases the melting temperature of the bi‐metallic system. However, the most important observation is the separation of the nanostructure into Au and Pd phases at temperatures above 850 °C for high Pd doping. The extent of Pd separation depends on the amount of initial Pd loading. A Janus Au─Pd nanostructure is formed at the end of the thermal treatments at 1000 °C. The phase‐separated NP is observed to be highly stable and could be clearly beneficial for various applications, particularly in catalytic processes.

This study considers the issue of automated segmentation of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) datasets using unsupervised machine learning approaches. To this end, a systematic comparison of two clustering workflows that had been established in previous literature was performed on two distinct material systems—an experimentally acquired Co2FeSi Heusler alloy and a simulated Au-matrix and Al2Cu precipitate. The cluster outputs were evaluated using a variety of unsupervised clustering metrics measuring separation and cohesion. It was found that the cluster output of a variational autoencoder (VAE) performed better compared to a more conventional latent transformation via Uniform Manifold Approximation & Projection (UMAP) on 4D-STEM data alone. However, the UMAP workflow applied to merged 4D-STEM and STEM-energy dispersive x-ray (STEM-EDX) data produced the best cluster output overall, indicating that the correlated information provides beneficial constraints to the latent space. A potential general workflow for analyzing merged datasets to identify structural-composition changes across different material systems is proposed.

Abstract Quantum chemistry (QC) calculations have significantly advanced the development of materials, drugs, and other molecular products. Molecular geometry optimization is an indispensable step for QC calculations. However, its computational cost increases dramatically with increasing molecular system complexity, hindering the large‐scale molecule screening. This work proposes a deep learning‐based molecular potential energy surface prediction tool (DeePEST) to significantly accelerate geometry optimizations. The key of DeePEST involves the development of a novel machine learning potential model for accurate and fast predictions of molecular energy and atomic forces. These predictions enable efficient molecular geometry optimizations for subsequent predictions of QC properties (single‐point energy, dipole moment, HOMO/LUMO, and 13 C chemical shifts) and COSMO‐SAC‐based thermodynamic properties (activity coefficient). Moreover, DeePEST facilitates efficient computer‐aided molecular designs that involve QC‐based geometry optimizations. The utilization of DeePEST in geometry optimizations achieves high prediction accuracy approaching to rigorous QC methods while maintaining the computational efficiency of molecular mechanics methods.

The reactions critical for the energy transition center on the chemistry of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and the heterogeneous catalyst surfaces that make up electrochemical energy conversion systems. Together, the surface-adsorbate interactions constitute the electrochemical interphase and define reaction kinetics of many clean energy technologies. Practical devices introduce high levels of complexity where surface roughness, structure, composition, and morphology combine with electrolyte, pH, diffusion, and system level limitations to challenge our ability to deconvolute underlying phenomena. To make significant strides in materials design, a structured approach based on well-defined surfaces is necessary to selectively control distinct parameters, while complexity is added sequentially through careful application of nanostructured surfaces. In this review, we cover advances made through this approach for key elements in the field, beginning with the simplest hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions and concluding with more complex organic molecules. In each case, we offer a unique perspective on the contribution of well-defined systems to our understanding of electrochemical energy conversion technologies and how wider deployment can aid intelligent materials design.

Understanding the ultrafast vibrational relaxation following photoexcitation of molecules in a condensed phase is essential to predict the outcome and improve the efficiency of photoinduced molecular processes. Here, the vibrational decoherence and energy relaxation of a binuclear complex, [Pt2(P2O5H2)4]4− (PtPOP), upon electronic excitation in liquid water and acetonitrile are investigated through direct adiabatic dynamics simulations. A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme is used where the excited state of the complex is modeled with orbital-optimized density functional calculations while solvent molecules are described using potential energy functions. The decoherence time of the Pt–Pt vibration dominating the photoinduced dynamics is found to be ∼1.6 ps in both solvents. This is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements in water, where intersystem crossing is slow (&gt;10 ps). Pathways for the flow of excess energy are identified by monitoring the power of the solvent on vibrational modes. The latter are obtained as generalized normal modes from the velocity covariances, and the power is computed using QM/MM embedding forces. Excess vibrational energy is found to be predominantly released through short-range repulsive and attractive interactions between the ligand atoms and surrounding solvent molecules, whereas solute–solvent interactions involving the Pt atoms are less important. Since photoexcitation deposits most of the excess energy into Pt–Pt vibrations, energy dissipation to the solvent is inefficient. This study reveals the mechanism behind the exceptionally long vibrational coherence of the photoexcited PtPOP complex in solution and underscores the importance of short-range interactions for accurate simulations of vibrational energy relaxation of solvated molecules.

Abstract The slow reaction kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on existing catalysts in alkaline hinders the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). In this work, a Cu‐incorporated NiW alloy (Cu i ‐NiW) without any platinum group metal (PGM) is designed and evaluated in both liquid cells and AEMFCs. This catalyst enabled the achievement of an electrochemical surface area‐normalized exchange current density of 70 µA cm −2 and robust stability, outperforming most PGM‐free catalysts. Furthermore, the incorporation of Cu into other systems such as NiMo and NiV using the same method also showcased excellent HOR activity and durability. The fuel cells assembled with Cu i ‐NiW as the anode and Pt/C or Fe‐N‐C as the cathode delivered peak power densities of 480 and 340 mW cm −2 , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the incorporated Cu is chemically inert but enhances the overall oxidation resistance of the catalysts. Moreover, it weakens hydrogen adsorption and promotes the adsorption of hydroxide ions, thereby enhancing the HOR activity significantly. These results may open a door for rational design of high‐performance and durable PGM‐free HOR catalysts.

Colloidal nanocrystals inherently undergo structural changes during chemical reactions. The robust structure-property relationships, originating from their nanoscale dimensions, underscore the significance of comprehending the dynamic structural behavior of nanocrystals in reactive chemical media. Moreover, the complexity and heterogeneity inherent in their atomic structures require tracking of structural transitions in individual nanocrystals at three-dimensional (3D) atomic resolution. In this study, we introduce the method of time-resolved Brownian tomography to investigate the temporal evolution of the 3D atomic structures of individual nanocrystals in solution. The methodology is applied to examine the atomic-level structural transformations of Pt nanocrystals during oxidative etching. The time-resolved 3D atomic maps reveal the structural evolution of dissolving Pt nanocrystals, transitioning from a crystalline to a disordered structure. Our study demonstrates the emergence of a phase at the nanometer length scale that has received less attention in bulk thermodynamics.

Understanding the arrangement of ionic liquids at the interface and their interactions with the surface is crucial for enhancing selectivity in heterogeneous reactions for practical applications. In this study, we investigate the nature of the adsorption and structural orientations of a sulfonyl-based ionic liquid on platinum-based mono- and bimetallic (111) surfaces employing replica exchange molecular dynamics and first-principles density functional theory calculations. More than 30 confirmations of the ionic liquid are identified on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. In addition to adsorption energies, factors such as dynamics of ionic liquids, molecule-surface distances, and charge transfer analyses are found to be important indicators for understanding adsorption phenomena. The sulfonyl anion exhibits contrasting behavior on the two surfaces, showing a preference for chemisorption on the monometallic surface, while the pyrrolidinium cation is physisorbed on both metal surfaces. Both metal surfaces are negatively charged primarily because of charge transfer from the sulfonyl anion. The analysis of the orientational preference reveals a nearly flat orientation of the cation on the monometallic surface, while a tilted orientation is observed on the bimetallic surface.

Detailed atomic-scale understanding is a crucial prerequisite for rational design of next-generation single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, the sub-ångström precision needed for systematic studies is challenging to achieve on common SACs. Here, we present a two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic system featuring Fe-N4 single-atom sites, where the metal-organic structure is modulated by 0.4 Å corrugation of an inert graphene/Ir(111) support. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory, we show that the support corrugation significantly affects the reactivity of the system, as the sites above the support "valleys" bind TCNQ (tetracyanoquinodimethane) significantly stronger than the sites above the "hills". The experimental temperature stability of TCNQ varies by more than 60 °C, while computations indicate more than 0.3 eV variation of TCNQ adsorption energy across the Fe-N4 sites placed atop different regions of the corrugated graphene unit cell. The origin of this effect is steric hindrance, which plays a role whenever large molecules interact with neighboring single-atom catalyst sites or when multiple reactants coadsorb on such sites. Our work demonstrates that such effects can be quantitatively studied using model SAC systems supported on chemically inert and physically corrugated supports.

Sustainable economic development to improve the quality of life and ensure the reduction of carbon emissions to minimize the threats of climate change have become global trends of modern times and strategic priorities of almost all countries of the world, including Ukraine.The article substantiates the importance of adhering to the principles of sustainable development, attracting investment resources for these purposes, using new approaches to financial, economic and organizational mechanisms for the implementation of innovative technologies for reducing carbon emissions (CCS) in the context of ensuring the strengthening of national defense.The essence and features of the technological process for CCS are revealed, the scale of participation of countries of the world in CCS projects and the predicted dynamics of reducing CO2 emissions under their implementation are analyzed. The financial, economic and organizational mechanisms for ensuring the effective implementation of CCS projects are characterized, their structure is detailed. The regulatory policy and regulatory framework of various countries supporting the deployment of CCS technologies, the practice of governments using financial and economic mechanisms, as well as attracting private financing to support investments in CCS are summarized.The initiatives of the Government of Ukraine regarding energy efficiency and the implementation of innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions are analyzed, recommendations are provided for the expansion of financial and economic mechanisms.A correlation is identified between the implementation of innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions and the strengthening of national defense in such key aspects as energy security and defense capability, reducing environmental risks at military facilities, using defense infrastructure to implement environmentally friendly innovations, cooperation within the framework of financial, economic and organizational mechanisms for the implementation of innovative technologies, the social aspect and strategic sustainability.It is concluded that, based on the experience of foreign countries in implementing CCS technologies, Ukraine should take a balanced approach to the development and implementation of CCS projects, improving existing financial, economic and organizational mechanisms, using international support and technical assistance from partner countries. This will allow realizing the existing potential for implementing the Strategy for Low-Carbon Development of Ukraine until 2050. The post-war reconstruction of the Ukrainian economy based on the principles of sustainable development and the orientation towards the use of the most modern innovative technologies will allow significantly modernizing its production potential, strengthening energy independence and environmental sustainability, which, of course, will have a synergistic effect on strengthening national defense.

Abstract Heteroatom‐bridged dual‐atom catalysts (DACs), featuring more flexible active sites and intermetallic interaction, provide an opportunity for sustainable environmental remediation. Herein, an innovative oxygen‐bridged Co‐Cu DAC supported on nano‐alumina (CoOCu‐DAC) is fabricated using a straightforward two‐step process. The as‐prepared catalyst significantly enhances both decontamination kinetics and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) utilization efficiency by 1–3 orders of magnitude toward monoethanolamine (MEA, p K a = 9.5) compared to Co single‐atom catalyst (Co‐SAC) and bulk metal catalysts, and largely outperforms previously reported systems. In‐situ ATR‐FTIR and theoretical investigations reveal that the secondary introduction of Cu plays multiple important roles: it activates lattice oxygen to trigger key proton transfer (PT) of MEAH + via nucleophilic attack at the interface and subsequently favors deprotonated MEA as an efficient electron donor to accelerate electron transfer (ET) by enhancing orbital overlaps for the co‐activation of O 2 and PMS. Such a stepwise proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET)‐enhanced catalytic pathway mediated by CoOCu‐DAC is fundamentally different from common route identified in Co‐SAC‐involved Fenton‐like system. The established binary QSAR further substantiates the universality of PCET‐enhanced strategy toward versatile nitrogen‐containing organic compounds. This study offers a new perspective for sustainable water decontamination and other related areas of catalysis based on rationalized design of multifunctional catalysts at atomic level.

We investigate a continuous electrochemical pH-swing method to capture CO2 from a gas phase. The electrochemical cell consists of a single cation-exchange membrane (CEM) and a recirculation of a mixture of salt and phenazine-based redox-active molecules. In the absorption compartment, this solution is saturated by CO2 from a mixed gas phase at high pH. In the electrochemical cell, pH is reduced, and CO2 is selectively released in a desorption step. We investigate the influence of redox molecule concentration on the charge storage capacity of the solution, as well as the impact of current density and solution recirculation rate on process performance. A theoretical framework, based on a minimal set of assumptions, is established. This framework describes the data very accurately and can be used for system design and optimization. We evaluate the trade-off between energy consumption and CO2 capture rate and compare with published reports. We report a low energy consumption of 32 kJ/mol of CO2 at a capture rate of 39 mmol/m2/min.

Climate change mitigation by decreasing worldwide CO2 emissions is an urgent and demanding challenge that requires innovative technical solutions. This work, inspired by vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), introduces an integrated electrochemical process for carbon capture and energy storage. It utilizes established vanadium and ferricyanide redox couples for pH modulation for CO2 desorption and absorbent regeneration. The developed process consumes electricity during the daytime─when renewable electricity is available─to desorb CO2 and charge the cell, and it can regenerate the absorbent for further CO2 absorption while releasing electricity to the grid during nighttime when solar power is unavailable. This research explores the process fundamentals and scalability potential, through an extensive study of the system's thermodynamics, transport phenomena, kinetics, and bench-scale operations. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was utilized to study the thermodynamics of the process, mapping the redox profiles to identify ideal potential windows for operation. The CV results indicated that an overpotential of approximately 0.3 V was required for driving redox reactions. Additionally, polarization studies were conducted to select the practical operating potential, identifying 0.5 V as optimal for the CO2 desorption cycle to provide sufficient polarity to overcome activation barriers in addition to the Nernstian potential. Mass transfer analysis balanced conductivity and desorption efficiency, with a 1:1 ratio identified as optimal for redox-active species and background electrolyte concentration. To further enhance the kinetics of the redox reactions, plasma treatment of electrode surfaces was implemented, resulting in a 43% decrease in charge transfer resistance, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Finally, a bench-scale operation of the system demonstrated an energy consumption of 54 kJ/mol CO2, which is competitive with other electrochemical carbon capture technologies. Besides its energy competitiveness, the process offers multiple additional advantages, including the elimination of precious metal electrodes, oxygen insensitivity in flue gas, scalability inspired by VRFB technology, and the unique ability to function as a battery during the absorbent regeneration process, enabling efficient day-night operation.
