As a catalytic center, the 4N-coordinated post-transition metal (PM) confined within phthalocyanine (Pc) shows promise for the environmentally friendly synthesis of CH4 and NH3. A range of PM–Pc catalysts (where PM represents Al, Ga, In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, and Bi) is methodically evaluated through DFT mechanistic analysis and electrochemical exploration to determine their stability, activity, and selectivity. Our comparative analysis reveals that the orientational specificity of initial cyanide adsorption would play a crucial role in cyanide electroreduction reaction (CNRR) pathways within diverse PM–Pc nanosheets. Specifically, the NC* model typically requires higher supplies of Gibbs free energy for the CNRR, preponderantly resulting in CH3NH2. Conversely, the counterpart of the CN* model necessitates lower energetic demands, leading to a broader diversity of products including methane and ammonia. Of particular significance that the relationships of limiting potentials (UL) through two types of descriptors, ΔGNC*→HNC* and ΔGCN*→HCN*, were essential for constructing volcano plots, thus illustrating the relation within the intrinsic adsorption performance of diverse PM–Pc series and their associated prominent CNRR efficiency. From a comprehensive screening of the studied results, we have determined that the nanosheets Al–Pc, In–Pc, Ge–Pc, and Sn–Pc (triggered by the CN* model) are the exceptionally proficient electrocatalysts, specifically in producing only CH4 and NH3 via the CNRR process, as indicated by our final compiled findings. Within the range of nanosheets evaluated, the Al–Pc associated model emerges as a standout, demonstrating markedly higher selectivity and CNRR activity than its counterparts. This study advances the understanding of the unique superior characteristics of SACs, subsequently providing innovative perspectives that could directly guide their discovery for CNRR applications.

For more than a dozen years, “breaking scaling relations” has been regarded by many as a top priority in computational and experimental electrocatalysis. Numerous works claim to have done it, and literature reviews are available that summarize the strategies to do it. However, in most cases, it seems more like a slogan than a clear, experimentally realizable catalyst design paradigm. It is worth asking whether we know of any materials that unmistakably break scaling relations and, more importantly, if the breaking of a problematic scaling relation is the end of all troubles in electrocatalysis. On the basis of some quantitative examples related to CO2 electroreduction and the concept of “ghost scaling relation,” I will try to address these and other fundamental questions related to scaling relations.

Nanostructure platinum is an effective catalyst that is active toward a broad range of electrochemical processes over a wide range of pH values. However, its high cost and low abundance prevent its widespread use in practical devices. A promising strategy to overcome the limitations of platinum is to combine platinum with less expensive and more abundant transition metals. In this report, we employ an ambient, template-based approach to prepare monodisperse Co nanotubes (NTs) and modify them with platinum via an electroless deposition process. The composition of the resulting Pt modified Co NTs (Pt-Co NTs) can be varied by controlling the Pt ion concentration in the electroless deposition step. The resulting Pt-Co NTs have a hierarchical structure consisting of Pt-Co NTs coated with an amorphous Co-oxide film. The amorphous Co-oxide coating activates the Pt-Co NTs to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) leading to a 9-fold enhancement in the OER activity in an 80% (by mass) Pt-Co NT relative to pure Pt nanowires. The surface oxide coating can be selectively removed by cycling the Pt-Co NTs in an acidic solution. Removing the oxide film activates the Pt-Co NTs toward methanol oxidation (MOR) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. In both cases, the trends in MOR and ORR activity follow a volcano-type dependence as a function of composition. The catalyst with the optimum composition of 60% Pt has a 4-fold increase in the specific activity for MOR and maintains a +20 mV shift in the half-wave potential for ORR relative to that of pure Pt nanowires.

The photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (pNRR) is a clean technology that converts H2O and N2 into NH3 under environmental conditions using inexhaustible sunlight. Herein, we designed a novel two-dimensional (2D) Janus TiSiGeN4 structure and evaluated the pNRR performance of the structure with the presence of nitrogen vacancies at different positions using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The intrinsic dipoles in the Janus TiSiGeN4 structure generate a built-in electric field, which promotes the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes towards the (001) and (00-1) surfaces, respectively, to achieve efficient charge separation. For the pNRR, the Si atoms exposed after the formation of top N vacancies can realize the efficient activation of N2 through the "acceptance-donation" mechanism, while the presence of middle N vacancies not only suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, a competition reaction, but also lowers the reaction barrier for the protonation of N atoms. The limiting potential of TiSiGeN4 with the coexistence of both top and middle N vacancies (TiSiGeN4-VN-mt) is as low as -0.44 V. In addition, the introduction of N vacancies generates defect levels, narrowing the band gap and improving the light response. This work provides theoretical guidance for the design of efficient pNRR photocatalysts under mild conditions.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis has emerged as a highly promising technology for sustainable hydrogen (H2) production, but its widespread application relies heavily on the development of high-performance and cost-effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Currently, noble-metal-based materials (such as Pt and Ir/Ru oxides) serve as benchmark electrocatalysts for HER and OER in acidic environments, but their high cost and limited availability pose major challenges toward industrialization. Low-cost noble-metal-free metal oxides are an important class of functional materials with rich compositions and structures, offering flexible electronic and crystal structures with tunable physical and chemical properties. In this Review, we present a comprehensive and timely summary of the remarkable progress achieved in the field of noble-metal-free metal oxides for catalyzing acidic HER and OER. First, we provide a brief description of the fundamental concepts of HER and OER in acidic media, including mechanisms, computational activity descriptors, and experimental parameters that are utilized for the evaluation of catalytic performance. Second, an overview is provided covering various types of noble-metal-free metal oxides for HER and OER in acidic media reported so far (e.g., simple transition metal oxides, spinel oxides, rutile antimonate oxides, perovskite oxides, specially structured metal oxides, and mixed-metal-oxide composites), with a focus on the designed strategies for enhancing performance and establishing correlations between properties and activity. Lastly, the challenges and future research directions regarding acidic HER and OER are summarized and discussed.

Abstract Guided by the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the development of efficient, stable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions is of paramount importance. A unique; tremella-like LaNiO 3 -NiO composite has been fabricated through a simple and robust procedure. This material stands out as an effective catalyst in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), showcasing its potential to enhance the efficiency of electrochemical energy transformations. This composite exhibits a remarkably low overpotential of only 383 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , coupled with a Tafel slope of 76.66 mV dec -1 . Furthermore, it boasts the capability to sustain continuous operation for more than 30 h at a current density of 20 mA cm -2 . The unique morphology of the catalyst expands the electrochemically active surface area, providing more available active sites to improve catalytic performance. This discovery presents a promising opportunity for the development of non-precious metal electrocatalysts for OER.

Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising strategy to solve and mitigate the coming energy shortage and global environmental pollution. Searching for efficient electrocatalysts for HER remains challenging through traditional trial‐and‐error methods from numerous potential material candidates. Theoretical high throughput calculation assisted by machine learning is a possible method to screen excellent HER electrocatalysts effectively. This will pave the way for high‐efficiency and low‐price electrocatalyst findings. In this review, we comprehensively introduce the machine learning workflow and standard models for hydrogen reduction reactions. This mainly illustrates how machine learning is used in catalyst filtration and descriptor exploration. Subsequently, several applications, including surface electrocatalysts, two‐dimensional (2D) electrocatalysts, and single/dual atom electrocatalysts using machine learning in electrocatalytic HER, are highlighted and introduced. Finally, the corresponding challenge and perspective for machine learning in electrocatalytic hydrogen reduction reactions are concluded. We hope this critical review can provide a comprehensive understanding of machine learning for HER catalyst design and guide the future theoretical and experimental investigation of HER catalyst findings.

The rate-determining oxygen evolution reaction (OER) always limits the high-efficient conversion of solar energy to green hydrogen fuels through photoelectrocatalytic or photocatalytic water splitting. The high catalytic overpotential and the instability of catalytic center are commonly regarded as the primary factors contributing to the low rate of OER, remaining to be a challenge in the field of water splitting. Herein, a polymetallic oxide cocatalyst (Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx) with well-defined electronic and catalytic properties is designed on BiVO4 photoelectrode for highly efficient and stable photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. The experimental characterization demonstrates that the dual-layer design of Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx can significantly optimizes the electronic property of MnOy and FeCoNiOx components, boosting the photogenerated charge transfer between Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx cocatalyst and BiVO4 photoelectrode. The density functional theory (DFT) simulation reveals that the Mo sites in Mo-MnOy layer can activate the neighboring surface Mn sites instead of directly serving as the catalytic center, thereby establishing these Mn sites as primary active centers for achieving stable OER. The developed Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx/BiVO4 photoelectrode exhibits a current density of 6.18 mA cm−2 with an excellent stability for 30 h at 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun irradiation, exhibiting the excellent activity and durability. This work sheds light on design of high-performance multiple-component water-oxidation cocatalyst on photoanode.

Abstract Driven by the goal of establishing a fossil‐fuel‐free and nuclear‐power‐free economy based on renewable energy, metal‐air batteries are regarded as promising energy conversion and storage devices. Developing efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalysts for the air electrode of metal‐air batteries is becoming increasingly important. In this work, 36 transition metal (TM) single‐atom catalysts are designed based on MXenes Ti 2 CT 2 with different surface terminal atoms (T = O, S, Cl), and their ORR/OER catalytic activity and stability are evaluated by the density functional theory. Ni@Ti 2 CO 2 , Pd@Ti 2 CS 2 , and Co@Ti 2 CCl 2 are found to exhibit good catalytic activity with ORR/OER overpotentials of .54 V/.62 V, .59 V/.29 V, .44 V/.40 V. The aggregation behavior of three catalysts is estimated by comparing the average binding energy of one, two, three, and four TM atoms anchored on Ti 2 CT 2 . This work cannot only provide a theoretical guide to develop bifunctional single‐atom catalysts, but also help us understand the effect of terminal atoms on the electronic structures and catalytic activity of TM@Ti 2 CT 2 .

This study undertakes a thorough computational exploration of Ziegler–Natta catalysis, emphasizing the role of external donors, particularly dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane (D donor), in the production of polypropylene. Employing the PreFerred Potential (PFP) model within the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method and Universal Neural Network Potentials (UNNP), we meticulously assessed the structural integrity of MgCl2 crystals, the dynamics of TiCl4 adsorption, and the kinetics of propylene insertion reactions. Our results demonstrated the precision of the PFP model in accurately replicating the crystalline structures and reaction mechanisms inherent in Ziegler–Natta catalyst systems. A pivotal finding from our research is the significant reduction in activation energy for isotactic propylene insertion, attributed to the presence of at least two D donors around a single Ti active site. Additionally, our computational approach, characterized by its speed and efficiency, successfully incorporates realistic catalyst models, encompassing a range of donor compounds, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental practices. Our study not only corroborated the existing computational models but also provided novel insights into the mechanistic roles of external donors in Ziegler–Natta catalysis. The implications of these findings extend beyond theoretical studies, offering practical applications in the field of catalytic science and propylene polymerization. This research paves the way for future investigations, potentially transforming our understanding and utilization of Ziegler–Natta catalysts in industrial applications.

Abstract A robust method for enhancing the dispersion and stabilization of small metal nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalysts is developed. It involves in situ complexation of palladium(II) by histidine, in water, prior to impregnation in fumed silica. TEM images show that the histidine facilitates dispersion of the Pd(II) into finer nanoscale particles (≈2 nm) uniformly distributed on the support, rather than the large clusters (≈5 nm) seen in the absence of histidine. After hydrogen reduction, assessments using CO chemisorption and propylene hydrogenation indicate that the coordinated histidine might obscure the active sites on the Pd particles. However, as histidine decomposes between 220 and 300 °C in air, these materials are treated at 225 °C in air for 48 h. Afterwards the Pd(II) particles remain the same size, but after hydrogen reduction, there is a 2.4‐fold increase in CO gas adsorption, indicative of an expanded Pd surface area. Furthermore, superior catalyst stability (activity >200 h) is observed during propylene hydrogenation at 250 °C. This is consistent with histidine use having generated widely spaced, uniformly small, Pd nanoparticles on the silica support which is expected to help prevent agglomeration (sintering) during catalysis. This is a convenient low‐cost strategy for reducing metal content, preventing sintering and optimizing catalyst performance.

Ion mobility in electrolytes and electrodes is a critical factor influencing the performance of batteries. Low ion mobility is, for example, one of the major factors reducing the range of battery-electric vehicles in winter. On the other hand, with respect to the ion mobility in battery cathode materials, there are scaling relations linking large insertion energies and thus high voltages with high migration barriers corresponding to low ion mobility. Consequently, a compromise has to be made between these two conflicting properties. In this opinion, we will address how computational screening and the identification of descriptors can accelerate the search for solid battery materials with improved ion migration properties, but we will also discuss how the scaling relations linking reaction and activation energies might be overcome.

Abstract Above‐band gap optical excitation of non‐centrosymmetric semiconductors can lead to the spatial shift of the center of electron charge in a process known as shift current. Shift current is investigated in single‐crystal SnS 2 , a layered semiconductor with the band gap of ≈2.3 eV, by THz emission spectroscopy and first principles density functional theory (DFT). It is observed that normal incidence excitation with above gap (400 nm; 3.1 eV) pulses results in THz emission from 2H SnS 2 () polytype, where such emission is nominally forbidden by symmetry. It is argued that the underlying symmetry breaking arises due to the presence of stacking faults that are known to be ubiquitous in SnS 2 single crystals and construct a possible structural model of a stacking fault with symmetry properties consistent with the experimental observations. In addition to shift current, it is observed THz emission by optical rectification excited by below band gap (800 nm; 1.55 eV) pulses but it requires excitation fluence more than two orders of magnitude higher to produce same signal amplitude. These results suggest that ultrafast shift current in which can be excited with visible light in blue–green portion of the spectrum makes SnS 2 a promising source material for THz photonics.

Electronic structure theory, i.e., quantum chemistry, is the fundamental building block for many problems in computational chemistry. We present a new distributed computing framework (BigChem), which allows for an efficient solution of many quantum chemistry problems in parallel. BigChem is designed to be easily composable and leverages industry-standard middleware (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ, and Redis) for distributed approaches to large scale problems. BigChem can harness any collection of worker nodes, including ones on cloud providers (such as AWS or Azure), local clusters, or supercomputer centers (and any mixture of these). BigChem builds upon MolSSI packages, such as QCEngine to standardize the operation of numerous computational chemistry programs, demonstrated here with Psi4, xtb, geomeTRIC, and TeraChem. BigChem delivers full utilization of compute resources at scale, offers a programable canvas for designing sophisticated quantum chemistry workflows, and is fault tolerant to node failures and network disruptions. We demonstrate linear scalability of BigChem running computational chemistry workloads on up to 125 GPUs. Finally, we present ChemCloud, a web API to BigChem and successor to TeraChem Cloud. ChemCloud delivers scalable and secure access to BigChem over the Internet.

Developing non-precious-metal electrocatalysts that can operate with a low overpotential at a high current density for industrial application is challenging. Heterogeneous bimetallic phosphides have attracted much interest. Despite high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, the ordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance hinders their practical use. Herein, it is shown that Fe-doping reverses and enlarges the interfacial electrical field at the heterojunction, turning the H intermediate favorable binding sites for HER into O intermediate favorable sites for OER. Specifically, the self-supported heterojunction catalysts on nickel foam (CoP@Ni2P/NF and Fe-CoP@Fe-Ni2P/NF) are readily synthesized. They only require the overpotentials of 266 and 274 mV to drive a large current density of 1000 mA cm-2 (j1000) for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, a water splitting cell equipped with these electrodes only requires a voltage of 1.724 V to drive j1000 with excellent durability, demonstrating the potential of industrial application. This work offers new insights on interfacial engineering for heterojunction catalysts.

The in situ solvothermal conversion of metal–organic gels (MOGs) to crystalline metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a versatile and ingenious strategy that has been employed for the synthesis of MOF materials with specific morphologies, high yield, and improved functional properties. Herein, we have adopted an in situ solvothermal conversion of bimetallic MOGs to crystalline bimetallic MOFs with the aim of introducing a redox-active metal heterogeneity into the monometallic counterpart. The formation of bimetallic NiZn-MOF and CoZn-MOF via in situ solvothermal sol–gel–crystal and sol–crystal transformation is found to depend on the solvent systems used. The sol-to-gel-to-crystal transformation of NiZn-MOF via the formation of NiZn-MOG is found to occur through the gradual disruption of gel fibers leading to subsequent formation of microcrystals and single crystals of NiZn-MOF. These bimetallic MOFs and MOGs serve as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an excellent methanol tolerance property, which can be attributed to the enhanced mass and charge transfer, higher oxygen vacancies, and bimetallic synergistic interactions among the heterometals. This work demonstrates a convenient strategy for producing bimetallic MOGs to MOFs through the introduction of a redox-active metal heterogeneity in the inorganic hybrid functional materials for fundamental and applied research. Our results connect MOGs and MOFs which have been regarded as having opposite physical states, that is, soft vs hard, and provide promising structural correlation between MOGs and MOFs at the molecular level.

Water electrolysis is among the recent alternatives for generating clean fuels (hydrogen). It is an efficient way to produce pure hydrogen at a rapid pace with no unwanted by-products. Effective and cheap water-splitting electrocatalysts with enhanced activity, specificity, and stability are currently widely studied. In this regard, noble metal-free transition metal-based catalysts are of high interest. Iron sulfide (FeS) is one of the essential electrocatalysts for water splitting because of its unique structural and electrochemical features. This article discusses the significance of FeS and its nanocomposites as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and overall water splitting. FeS and its nanocomposites have been studied also for energy storage in the form of electrode materials in supercapacitors and lithium- (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The structural and electrochemical characteristics of FeS and its nanocomposites, as well as the synthesis processes, are discussed in this work. This discussion correlates these features with the requirements for electrocatalysts in overall water splitting and its associated reactions. As a result, this study provides a road map for researchers seeking economically viable, environmentally friendly, and efficient electrochemical materials in the fields of green energy production and storage.

Super abundant vacancies (SAVs) have been suggested to form in the fcc phase of plutonium, δ-Pu, under a low-pressure hydrogen environment. Under these conditions, the vacancy concentration is proposed to reach 10-3 at% due to H trapping in vacancies lowering the effective vacancy formation energy. Previous density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that seven H atoms can be trapped in a single vacancy when a collinear special quasirandom magnetic structure is used to stabilize the δ phase, suggesting SAVs are a possible source of H stored in plutonium. In this report, we present DFT results for δ-Pu in the noncollinear 3Q magnetic state to study the formation of SAVs in mechanically stable δ-Pu. Together with these new simulations, we use publicly available computational and experimental data to provide further constraints on the physical conditions needed to thermodynamically stabilize SAVs in δ-Pu. Using several thermodynamic models, we estimate the vacancy concentrations in δ-Pu and discuss the limits of hydrogen driven formation of vacancies in δ-Pu. We find that, when hydrogen in the lattice is equilibrated with gaseous H2, the formation of SAVs in δ-Pu is unlikely and any excess vacancy concentration beyond thermal vacancies would need to occur by a different mechanism.

Abstract Single‐atom alloys (SAAs) have gained increasing prominence in the field of selective hydrogenation reactions due to their uniform distribution of active sites and the unique host‐guest metal interactions. Herein, 15 SAAs are constructed to comprehensively elucidate the relationship between host‐guest metal interaction and catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of 4‐nitrostyrene (4‐NS) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results demonstrate that the SAAs with strong host‐guest metal interactions exhibit a preference for N─O bond cleavage, and the reaction energy barrier of the hydrogenation process is primarily influenced by the host metal. Among them, Ir 1 Ni SAA stands out as the prime catalyst candidate, showcasing exceptional activity and selectivity. Furthermore, the Ir 1 Ni SAA is subsequently prepared through precise synthesis techniques and evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of 4‐NS to 4‐aminostyrene (4‐AS). As anticipated, the Ir 1 Ni SAA demonstrates extraordinary catalytic performance (yield > 96%). In situ FT‐IR experiments and DFT calculations further confirmed that the unique host‐guest metal interaction at the Ir‐Ni interface site of Ir 1 Ni SAA endows it with excellent 4‐NS selective hydrogenation ability. This work provides valuable insights into enhancing the performance of SAAs catalysts in selective hydrogenation reactions by modulating the host‐guest metal interactions.

Epoxy resin thermosets (ERTs) are an important class of polymeric materials. However, owing to their highly cross-linked nature, they suffer from poor recyclability, which contributes to an unacceptable level of environmental pollution. There is a clear need for the design of inherently recyclable ERTs that are based on renewable resources. We present the synthesis and closed-loop recycling of a fully lignocellulose-derivable epoxy resin (DGF/MBCA), prepared from dimethyl ester of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (DMFD), 4,4′-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (MBCA), and glycidol, which displays excellent thermomechanical properties (a glass transition temperature of 170°C, and a storage modulus at 25°C of 1.2 gigapascals). Notably, the material undergoes methanolysis in the absence of any catalyst, regenerating 90% of the original DMFD. The diamine MBCA and glycidol can subsequently be reformed by acetolysis. Application and recycling of DGF/MBCA in glass and plant fiber composites are demonstrated.

Bisphenol compounds [bisphenol A (BPA), etc.] are one class of the most important and widespread pollutants in food and environment, which pose severe endocrine disrupting effect, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, and metabolic toxicity on humans and animals. Simultaneous rapid determination of BPA and its analogues (bisphenol S, bisphenol AF, etc.) with extraordinary potential resolution and sensitivity is of great significance but still extremely challenging. Herein, a series of single-atom catalysts (SACs) were synthesized by anchoring different metal atoms (Mg, Co, Ni, and Cu) on N-doped carbon materials and used as sensing materials for simultaneous detection of bisphenols with similar chemical structures. The Mg-based SAC enables the potential discrimination and simultaneous rapid detection of multiple bisphenols, showing outstanding analytical performances, outperforming all other SACs and traditional electrode materials. Our experiments and density functional theory calculations show that pyrrolic N serves as the adsorption site for the adsorption of bisphenols and the Mg atom serves as the active site for the electrocatalytic oxidation of bisphenols, which play a synergistic role as dual active centers in improving the sensing performance. The results of this work may pave the way for the rational design of SACs as advanced sensing and catalytic materials.

A strategic approach has been proposed for designing robust, high-performing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts tailored for saline water splitting. By employing a density functional theory (DFT)-based computational screening process, a set of promising dopants were identified from a range of 26 3d to 5d transition metals, with the aim of enhancing the activity and saline water resilience of the catalysts. The screening methodology was 3-fold, encompassing evaluations of OER energetics, chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) energetics, and chloride-corrosion energetics. The screening led to the selection of Sc as a promising dopant, which substantially elevated the performance of the NiFeOOH catalysts. This improvement was validated by an 87 mV decrease in OER overpotential at 100 mA/cm2 and a 100 h stability test under 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl conditions. This study contributes to the understanding of the alkaline ClER and chloride-corrosion mechanisms, providing insights into catalyst behavior under saline conditions.

Pt is a well-known benchmark catalyst in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that drives electrochemical O2-to-H2O conversion with maximum chemical energy-to-electricity efficiency. Once dispersing bulk Pt into isolated single atoms, however, the preferential ORR pathway remains a long-standing controversy due to their complex local coordination environment and diverse site density over substrates. Herein, using a set of carbon nanotube supported Pt–N–C single-atom catalysts, we demonstrate how the neighboring N dopants regulate the electronic structure of the Pt central atom and thus steer the ORR selectivity; that is, the O2-to-H2O2 conversion selectivity can be tailored from 10% to 85% at 0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, via a comprehensive X-ray-radiated spectroscopy and shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy analysis coupled with theoretical modeling, we reveal that a dominant pyridinic- and pyrrolic-N coordination within the first shell of Pt–N–C motifs favors the 4e– ORR, whereas the introduction of a second-shell graphitic-N dopant weakens *OOH binding on neighboring Pt sites and gives rise to a dominant 2e– ORR. These findings underscore the importance of the chemical environment effect for steering the electrochemical performance of single-atom catalysts.

The potential of maximum entropy (PME) is an indicator of extreme disorder at the electrode/electrolyte interface and can predict changes in catalytic activity within electrolytes of varying compositions. The laser‐induced current transient technique is employed to evaluate the PME for Au polycrystalline (Au pc ) electrodes immersed in Ar‐saturated cation electrolyte mixtures containing potassium and sodium ions at pH = 8. Five cation ratios (0.5 M K 2 SO 4 :0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 = 0:1, 0.25:0.75, 0.5:0.5, 0.75:0.25, and 1:0) are explored, considering earlier studies that unveil cation‐dependent shifts at near‐neutral pH. Moreover, for all electrolyte compositions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is utilized to determine the double‐layer capacitance ( C DL ), the minimum of which should be close to the potential of zero charge (PZC). By correlating cation molar ratios with the PMEs and PZCs, the impact on the model oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, assessed via the rotating disk electrode method, is analyzed. The results demonstrate a linear relationship between electrolyte cation mixtures and PME, while ORR activity exhibits an exponential trend. This observation validates the PME–activity link hypothesis, underscoring electrolyte components’ pivotal role in tailoring interfacial properties for electrocatalytic systems. These findings introduce a new degree of freedom for designing optimal electrocatalytic systems by adjusting various electrolyte components.

Highly active transition metal nitrides are desirable for electrocatalytic reactions, but their long-term stability is still unsatisfactory and thus limiting commercial applications. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique and universal room-temperature urea plasma method for controllable synthesis of N-doped carbon coated metal (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) nitrides arrays electrocatalysts. The preformed metal oxides arrays can be successfully converted into metal nitrides arrays with preserved nanostructures and a thin layer of N-doped carbon (N-C) via one-step urea plasma. Typically, as a representative case, N-C@CoN nanowire arrays are illustrated and corresponding formation mechanism by plasma is proposed. Notably, the designed N-C@CoN catalysts deliver excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability both in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). For OER, a low overpotential (264 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and high stability (>50 h at 20 mA/cm2) are acquired. For UOR, a current density of 100 mA/cm2 is achieved at only 1.39 V and maintain over 100 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that the synergetic coupling effect of CoN and N-C can significantly facilitate the charge-transfer process, optimize adsorbed intermediates binding strength and further greatly decrease the energy barrier. This strategy provides a novel method for fabrication of N-C@ metal nitrides as highly active and stable catalysts.

Abstract Supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) modules with bipolar stacks having 2, 4, 8, and 12 electrode pairs made from BPL 4 × 6 activated carbon are constructed and tested for carbon dioxide capture applications. Tests are performed with simulated flue gas (15%CO 2 /85%N 2 ) at 2, 4, 8, and 12 V, respectively. Reversible adsorption with sorption capacities (≈58 mmol kg −1 ) and adsorption rates (≈38 µmol kg −1 s −1 ) are measured for all stacks. The productivity scales with the number of cells in the module, and increases from 70 to 390 mmol h −1 m −2 . The energy efficiency and energy consumption improve with increasing number of bipolar electrodes from 67% to 84%, and 142 to 60 kJ mol −1 , respectively. Overall, the results show that SSA modules with bipolar electrodes can be scaled without reducing the adsorptive performance, and with improvement of energetic performance.
