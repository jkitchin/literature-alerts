Abstract Green hydrogen production is crucial for a sustainable future, but current catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffer from slow kinetics, despite many efforts to produce optimal designs, particularly through the calculation of descriptors for activity. In this study, we develop a dataset of density functional theory calculations of bulk and surface perovskite oxides, and adsorption energies of OER intermediates, which includes compositions up to quaternary and facets up to (555). We demonstrate that per-site properties of perovskite oxides such as Bader charge or band center can be tuned through element substitution and faceting, and develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts these properties directly from the local chemical environment. We leverage these per-site properties to identify promising perovskites with high theoretical OER activity. The identified design principles and promising materials provide a roadmap for closing the gap between current artificial catalysts and biological enzymes such as photosystem II.

Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction in aqueous electrolytes is a promising route to produce added-value chemicals and decrease carbon emissions. However, even in Gas-Diffusion Electrode devices, low aqueous CO 2 solubility limits catalysis rate and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that when assembled over a heterogeneous electrocatalyst, a film of nitrile-modified Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) acts as a remarkable CO 2 -solvation layer that increases its local concentration by ~27-fold compared to bulk electrolyte, reaching 0.82 M. When mounted on a Bi catalyst in a Gas Diffusion Electrode, the MOF drastically improves CO 2 -to-HCOOH conversion, reaching above 90% selectivity and partial HCOOH currents of 166 mA/cm 2 (at −0.9 V vs RHE). The MOF also facilitates catalysis through stabilization of reaction intermediates, as identified by operando infrared spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory. Hence, the presented strategy provides new molecular means to enhance heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction, leading it closer to the requirements for practical implementation.

The water oxidation reaction, a crucial process for solar energy conversion, has garnered significant research attention. Achieving efficient energy conversion requires the development of cost-effective and durable water oxidation catalysts. To design effective catalysts, it is essential to have a fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the understanding of the mechanisms of water oxidation using transition metal-based heterogeneous electrocatalysts, including Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu-based catalysts. It highlights the catalytic mechanisms of different transition metals and emphasizes the importance of monitoring of key intermediates to explore the reaction pathway. In addition, advanced techniques for physical characterization of water oxidation intermediates are also introduced, for the purpose of providing information for establishing reliable methodologies in water oxidation research. The study of transition metal-based water oxidation electrocatalysts is instrumental in providing novel insights into understanding both natural and artificial energy conversion processes.

Industrialization over the past two centuries has resulted in a continuous rise in global CO2 emissions. These emissions are changing ecosystems and livelihoods. Therefore, methods are needed to capture these emissions from point sources and possibly from our atmosphere. Though the amount of CO2 is rising, it is challenging to capture directly from air because its concentration in air is extremely low, 0.04%. In this study, amines installed inside metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are investigated for the adsorption of CO2, including at low concentrations. The amines used are polyamidoamine dendrimers that contain many primary amines. Chemically reversible adsorption of CO2 via carbamate formation was observed, as was enhanced uptake of carbon dioxide, likely via dendrimer-amide-based physisorption. Limiting factors in this initial study are comparatively low dendrimer loadings and slow kinetics for carbon dioxide uptake and release, even at 80 °C.

Abstract The proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE), crucial for green hydrogen production, is challenged by the scarcity and high cost of iridium‐based materials. Cobalt oxides, as ideal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), have not been extensively applied in PEMWE, due to extremely high voltage and poor stability at large current density, caused by complicated structural variations of cobalt compounds during the OER process. Thus, the authors sought to introduce chromium into a cobalt spinel (Co 3 O 4 ) catalyst to regulate the electronic structure of cobalt, exhibiting a higher oxidation state and increased Co–O covalency with a stable structure. In‐depth operando characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the activated Co–O covalency and adaptable redox behavior are crucial for facilitating its OER activity. Both turnover frequency and mass activity of Cr‐doped Co 3 O 4 (CoCr) at 1.67 V (vs RHE) increased by over eight times than those of as‐synthesized Co 3 O 4 . The obtained CoCr catalyst achieved 1500 mA cm −2 at 2.17 V and exhibited notable durability over extended operation periods – over 100 h at 500 mA cm −2 and 500 h at 100 mA cm −2 , demonstrating promising application in the PEMWE industry.

Cobalt nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-NC) catalysts are synthesized for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via the pyrolysis of zinc-mediated and SiO2-templated 2,6-diaminopyridine (DAP) composites. The resulting Co-NC(Zn12-SiO2[20])-900 demonstrates exceptional ORR activities, with half-wave and onset potentials of 0.835 V and 0.875 V, respectively, which is similar to Pt/C catalyst. In long-term durability test, the Co-NC(Zn12-SiO2[20])-900 catalyst exhibits a negligible E1/2 shift, and in methanol tolerance tests, it displays significantly better performance than commercial Pt/C catalyst. The superior performance can be attributed to the hierarchical porous structure, dense and highly accessible Co-N4 and graphitic nitrogen (g-N) sites. The high content of Co-N4 and g-N sites enhances 3d-orbital filling and reduces the Co centers' on-site magnetic moment, as calculated by density functional theory. This may lead to a decrease in the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS), which in turn enhances the intrinsic activity of the ORR.

Electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices support a promising green, efficient renewable way to solve energy-supply shortages and environmental problems. To promote reaction rates of involved electrochemical reactions, non-metal or noble metal electrocatalysts are elaborately designed. For optimizing the intrinsic structure and decreasing the cost, functional carbon dots (CDs) are chosen to add into these metal or metal-free materials, benefitting from their unique advantages of abundant surface functional groups, excellent electron acceptor/donor properties and high specific surface area. This review aims to support a summary of recent breakthrough in the application of CDs to regulate intrinsic structure of metal or metal-free materials including dispersibility, utilization efficiency, electronic state, partial charge distribution, and coordination environment of active atom-sites. Moreover, electrocatalytic performances (including stability, conductivity and antitoxicity, etc.) are also systematically investigated. Except that, the potential opportunities and challenges for application of CDs-based materials in the future are also discussed to promote the development of this field.

It is technically challenging to quantitatively apply strains to tune catalysis because most heterogeneous catalysts are nanoparticles, and lattice strains can only be applied indirectly via core–shell structures or crystal defects. Herein, we report quantitative relations between macroscopic strains and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities of dealloyed nanoporous gold (NPG) by directly applying macroscopic strains upon bulk NPG. It was found that macroscopic compressive strains lead to a decrease, while macroscopic tensile strains improve the HER activity of NPG, which is in line with the d-band center model. The overpotential and onset potential of HER display approximately a linear relation with applied macroscopic strains, revealing an ∼2.9 meV decrease of the binding energy per 0.1% lattice strains from compressive to tensile. The methodology with the high strain sensitivity of electrocatalysis, developed in this study, paves a new way to investigate the insights of strain-dependent electrocatalysis with high precision.

Heterostructure catalysts are considered as promising candidates for promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process due to their strong electron coupling. However, the inevitable dissolution and detachment of the heterostructure catalysts are caused by the severe reconstruction, dramatically limiting their industrial application. Herein, the NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets attached on Mo-NiO microrods (Mo-NiO@NiFe LDH) by the preoxidation strategy of the core NiMoN layer are synthesized for ensuring the high catalytic performance and stability. Owing to the enhanced electron coupling and preoxidation process, the obtained Mo-NiO@NiFe LDH exhibits a superlow overpotential of 253 mV to achieve a practically relevant current density of 1000 mA cm–2 for OER with exceptional stability over 1200 h. Notably, the overall water splitting system based on Mo-NiO@NiFe LDH reveals remarkable stability, maintaining the catalytic activity at a current density of 1000 mA cm–2 for 140 h under industrial harsh conditions. Furthermore, the Mo-NiO@NiFe LDH demonstrates outstanding activity and long-term durability in a practical alkaline electrolyzer assembly with a porous membrane, even surpassing the performance of IrO2. This work provides a new sight for designing and synthesizing highly stable heterojunction electrocatalysts, further promoting and realizing the industrial electrocatalytic OER.

With heterogeneous catalysts, chemical promotion takes place at their surfaces. Even in the case of single-atom alloys, where small quantities of a reactive metal are dispersed within the main host, it is assumed that both elements are exposed and available to bond with the reactants. Here, we show, on the basis of in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy data, that in alloy catalysts made from Pt highly diluted in Cu the Pt atoms are located at the inner interface between the metal nanoparticles and the silica support instead. Kinetic experiments indicated that these catalysts still display better selectivity for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols than the pure metals. Density functional theory calculations corroborated the stability of Pt at the metal–support interface and explained the catalytic performance as being due to a remote lowering of the activation barrier for the dissociation of H2 at Cu sites by the internal Pt atoms.

The complex interplay between local chemistry, the solvent microenvironment, and electrified interfaces frequently present in electrocatalytic reactions has motivated the development of quantum chemical methods that can accurately model these effects. Here, we predict the thermodynamics of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at sulfur vacancies in 1T′-phase MoS2 and highlight how the realistic treatment of potential within grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) seamlessly captures the multiple competing effects of applied potential on a catalyst interface interacting with solvated molecules. In the canonical approach, the computational hydrogen electrode is widely used and predicts that adsorbed N2 structure properties are potential-independent. In contrast, GC-DFT calculations show that reductive potentials activate N2 toward electroreduction by controlling its back-bonding strength and lengthening the N–N triple bond while decreasing its bond order. Similar trends are observed for another classic back-bonding ligand in CO, suggesting that this mechanism may be broadly relevant to other electrochemistries involving back-bonded adsorbates. Furthermore, reductive potentials are required to make the subsequent N2 hydrogenation steps favorable but simultaneously destabilizes the N2 adsorbed structure resulting in a trade-off between the favorability of N2 adsorption and the subsequent reaction steps. We show that GC-DFT facilitates modeling all these phenomena and that together they can have important implications in predicting electrocatalyst selectivity for the NRR and potentially other reactions.

In this work, we propose and validate a generalization of the Helmholtz model that can account for both “bell-shaped” and “camel-shaped” differential capacitance profiles of concentrated electrolytes, the latter being characteristic of ionic liquids. The generalization is based on introducing voltage dependence of both the dielectric constant “ϵr(V)” and thickness “L(V)” of the inner Helmholtz layer, as validated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We utilize MD simulations to study the capacitance profiles of three different electrochemical interfaces: (1) graphite/[BMIm+][BF4−] ionic liquid interface; (2) Au(100)/[BMIm+][BF4−] ionic liquid interface; (3) Au(100)/1M [Na+][Cl−] aqueous interface. We compute the voltage dependence of ϵr(V) and L(V) and demonstrate that the generalized Helmholtz model qualitatively describes both camel-shaped and bell-shaped differential capacitance profiles of ionic liquids and concentrated aqueous electrolytes (in lieu of specific ion adsorption). In particular, the camel-shaped capacitance profile that is characteristic of ionic liquid electrolytes arises simply from combination of the voltage-dependent trends of ϵr(V) and L(V). Furthermore, explicit analysis of the inner layer charge density for both concentrated aqueous and ionic liquid double layers reveal similarities, with these charge distributions typically exhibiting a dipolar region closest to the electrode followed by a monopolar peak at larger distances. It is appealing that a generalized Helmholtz model can provide a unified description of the inner layer structure and capacitance profile for seemingly disparate aqueous and ionic liquid electrolytes.

Modulation strategies are widely developed to regulate electronic state of single-atom catalysts (SACs) to reinforce the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the modulation effect using only single coordination regulation is often insufficient to optimize the electronic and geometric structure of metal active centers. Herein, a general strategy to modify the activity of single-atomic Fe site is achieved by dual decoration of Fe centers with contiguous sulfur atoms and metal nanoclusters via an aggregation-redispersion route. Under near-range engagement, the adjacent S atoms and Fe nanoclusters could break the symmetric electronic interface of Fe-N moiety, and act as the modulators to synergistically tune the electronic configurations of Fe centers, leading to less electron transfer to *OH, and subsequent favorable desorption. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical results reinforces the significant roles of S atoms and metal clusters in tandem by correlating their induced electron redistribution with ORR activity, which ultimately accelerates the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates for robust catalytic performance. Due to the improvement of graphitization degree, carbon supports possess efficient active sites and exhibit superior anti-corrosion. The resultant FeNC-2M demonstrates outstanding ORR activity with high power density, maintaining remarkable durability in Zn-air batteries and microbial fuel cells. This work provides effective and universal way to modulate microenvironment of single metal sites, facilitating the open up of potential application spaces for various SACs.

Carbon capture, as a core technology for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, the greatest challenge is the balance between separation performance and energy consumption. This study seeks to evaluate and screen the separation performance and energy consumption of four typical adsorbents (13X, Mg-MOF-74, activated carbon, and Lewatit VP OV 1065) in vacuum temperature swing adsorption (VTSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) through optimization approach, which will support in-depth research and decision-making on adsorption processes. A non-isothermal non-adiabatic numerical model was carried out to describe a novel 4-bed 10-step VTSA cycle developed on an exchange type adsorption unit (ETAU), and the model was validated by binary breakthrough and temperature swing experiments. A 4-bed 10-step VSA cycle was in turn established and investigated. Parametric analysis of the two cycles was performed by varying the operating variables including feed gas flow rate, recycle time, and purge-to-feed ratio. Process optimization of the multiplicative fraction evaluation function, simultaneously considering purity, recovery, and productivity, was achieved using a dual convergence algorithm. Results showed that all four adsorbents could achieve more than 90 % purity and recovery on the VTSA process employing the ETAU for post-combustion carbon capture, and the separation performance was substantially superior to that of the VSA cycle. Mg-MOF-74 obtained a CO2 product with 97.90 % purity, 98.48 % recovery, and 5.48 mol/kgads/hr productivity at a desorption temperature of 383.15 K; it has a specific heat consumption of 1.45 GJth/ton and a specific power consumption of 0.55 GJel/ton. The total energy consumption of 13X was slightly lower than that of amine adsorbents, giving 95.00 % purity, 97.60 % recovery, and 1.91 mol/kgads/hr productivity. Relatively low desorption temperature is expected to introduce ultra-low-grade waste heat for partial heat source substitution, contributing to the energy sustainability of adsorption carbon capture technology.

Despite enormous efforts towards development of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) technologies, industrial-scale devices are still visibly unavailable. The development of effective CO2RR catalysts appears to be the most difficult challenge for this technology. Due to the well-defined active site, distinct energy levels, and tunable core structure, porphyry-type molecular catalysts (metal-porphyrins, and metal-phthalocyanines) have gained attention among the various classes of electrocatalysts. But because they are not very stable or long-lasting, getting their benchmark CO2RR performance is still hard. Therefore, to approach their ideal performance, researchers have conducted many experimental and theoretical analyses, altering their electronic and geometric configurations and even transitioning them from homogeneous to heterogeneous phases. The aim of this review is to provide a coherent framework for the existing literature on molecular systems for CO2RR and to make forward-looking suggestions for the development of optimal CO2RR catalysts. We critically reviewed the possible strategies for tuning and controlling the catalytic active sites, emphasizing the bridges between activity and structural features of molecular systems, and proposed logical optimization strategies to improve their performance and selectivity. Insights provided in this article would surely benefit readers to develop novel high-performing CO2RR electrocatalysts in the future.

Improving the hydrogen storage performance of carbon-based materials via transition metals incorporation has been proved experimentally, where control over the hydrogen adsorption kinetics and hydrogen surface diffusion is the key. In this work, we proved theoretically via density functional theory (DFT) how such incorporation promotes better hydrogen storage performance in Ni-based materials supported on graphene, in which static and dynamic behavior of the system were modeled by plane-wave DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), respectively. In addition, the hydrogen storage materials Ni10Al3 and Ni13 supported on graphene, denoted as Ni10Al3/GP and Ni13/GP, are modeled to realize the experimental observation on Ni3Al alloy under high hydrogen pressure. It was found that the Ni10Al3/GP alloy system exhibited better properties in twofold: (1) increased hydrogen adsorption capacity through providing an additional site for H2 molecular adsorption, particularly on the Al atoms, and (2) enhanced hydrogen desorption at ambient conditions observed from reversible H2 adsorption at all coverages with barrierless migration energy. Therefore, the proof from the DFT point-of-view provides valuable insight into exploring other metal alloy systems that can provide additional sites for molecular hydrogen adsorption and improve hydrogen adsorbate mobility.

Entender que el contexto puede afectar un análisis de citas es esencial para interpretar adecuadamente los indicadores. Por esta razón, buscan reconocerse los factores que inciden en la citación de los artículos de las revistas biomédicas colombianas indexadas en Scopus a través del uso de algoritmos de Machine Learning. Con los algoritmos ‘Gradient Boosting Classifier’ y ‘Light Gradient Boosting Machine’ identificamos características de importancia como el índice h del primer y el último autor, acceso abierto, número de autores, palabras clave del artículo, además del número de páginas. Estas características fueron relevantes para el área de interés y pueden brindar un contexto para futuros análisis, considerando que lo relevante de un artículo no debería ser cuántas citaciones atrae, sino si este ayuda a llenar vacíos en el conocimiento.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a chemical reaction in the process of generating molecular oxygen in the oxidation of water during oxygenic photosynthesis, electrolysis of water into oxygen and hydrogen, and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Noble metal oxides such as ruthenium and iridium oxides have good electrocatalytic activity for the OER process, but they have disadvantages such as high cost, inaccessibility, limited reserves, and durability. Therefore, the design and preparation of a low-cost, highly active, and high stable performance catalyst is necessary. In this regard, dual-atom catalysts (DACs) are a suitable option according to their characterization such as good electrocatalytic activity, high atomic efficiency, and synergic effects. Their atomically dispersed active sites lead to maximum utilization efficiency of the metal sites. This chapter presents an outlook on the design, catalytic mechanism, and application of dual-atom catalysts in oxygen evolution reactions.

Since the oxygen is in a triplet state and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is related to the electron spin state, it is possible to improve the catalytic ability by regulating the spin state of the catalyst. From this point of view, we first introduce the unique electronic structure of oxygen, oxygen evolution reaction products, and then detail the mechanism of electron spin correlation in the entire oxygen evolution reaction, and how the catalyst affects this electron spin state, thereby affecting the catalytic reaction rate. Then, we introduced the research on the regulation of the electron spin states of the catalyst. Since the research dimension of the electron spin states is mostly concentrated at the atomic level, the unique atomic structure of the single-atom catalyst is more conducive to the first research. Therefore, we introduced the research on the spin state regulation of the single-atom catalyst. The spin state control at the atomic level of catalysts such as spinel is further introduced. Finally, the research on spin state regulation of oxygen evolution catalysts was summarized and prospected. In the future, the mechanism of spin state regulation of catalysts at the atomic level should be studied more clearly by developing in situ characterization techniques.

The wide product spectrum resulting from the intricate reactions of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) makes CO2RR unfavorable for industrial electrolysis. Herein, we demonstrate a hydrogen-feeding effect from copper-silica catalysts that can regulate CO2RR product selectivity via modulation of Cu dispersion in the copper-silica core-shell particles. We found electromethanation of CO2 is greatly enhanced on Cu-Si catalyst with optimally dispersed Cu nanoparticles, resulting in a high methane Faradaic efficiency of 72.9 %. In contrast, a lower or higher Cu dispersion correlated to a preferential (co-)production of methane and ethylene or hydrogen. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and spectroscopic analysis, we show Cu dispersion affects the Cu coverage on SiO2 and the exposure of Cu-O-Si interfacial sites for CO2RR and water dissociation. An optimum Cu dispersion creates abundant Cu-O-Si sites with reduced energy barriers for both the hydrogenation of *CHO and water dissociation, leading to selective methane formation.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, three-dimensional structures with high surface areas and tunable porosities. Made from metal nodes connected by organic linkers, the exact properties of a given MOF are determined by node and linker choice. MOFs hold promise for numerous applications, including gas capture and storage. M2(4,4′-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate)—henceforth simply M2(dobpdc), with M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, or Zn—is regarded as one of the most promising structures for CO2 capture applications. Further modification of the MOF with diamines or tetramines can significantly boost gas species selectivity, a necessity for the ultra-dilute CO2 concentrations in the direct-air capture of CO2. There are countless potential diamines and tetramines, paving the way for a vast number of potential sorbents to be probed for CO2 adsorption properties. The number of amines and their configuration in the MOF pore are key drivers of CO2 adsorption capacity and kinetics, and so a validation of computational prediction of these quantities is required to suitably use computational methods in the discovery and screening of amine-functionalized sorbents. In this work, we study the predictive accuracy of density functional theory and related calculations on amine loading and configuration for one diamine and two tetramines. In particular, we explore the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and its formulation for solids (PBEsol) with and without the Grimme-D2 and Grimme-D3 pairwise corrections (PBE+D2/3 and PBEsol+D2/3), two revised PBE functionals with the Grimme-D2 and Grimme-D3 pairwise corrections (RPBE+D2/3 and revPBE+D2/3), and the nonlocal van der Waals correlation (vdW-DF2) functional. We also investigate a universal graph deep learning interatomic potential’s (M3GNet) predictive accuracy for loading and configuration. These results allow us to identify a useful screening procedure for configuration prediction that has a coarse component for quick evaluation and a higher accuracy component for detailed analysis. Our general observation is that the neural network-based potential can be used as a high-level and rapid screening tool, whereas PBEsol+D3 gives a completely qualitatively predictive picture across all systems studied, and can thus be used for high accuracy motif predictions. We close by briefly exploring the predictions of relative thermal stability for the different functionals and dispersion corrections.

Abstract This article introduces neural graph distance embedding (nGDE), a method for generating 3D molecular geometries. Leveraging a graph neural network trained on the OE62 dataset of molecular geometries, nGDE predicts interatomic distances based on molecular graphs. These distances are then used in multidimensional scaling to produce 3D geometries, subsequently refined with standard bioorganic forcefields. The machine learning‐based graph distance introduced herein is found to be an improvement over the conventional shortest path distances used in graph drawing. Comparative analysis with a state‐of‐the‐art distance geometry method demonstrates nGDE's competitive performance, particularly showcasing robustness in handling polycyclic molecules—a challenge for existing methods.

Abstract A crucial factor in advancing the broad utilization of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the development of efficient catalysts with sufficient active sites. Herein, a hydrothermal approach is utilized to fabricate helical chain stacked two‐dimensional (2D) tellurium (Te) nanoflakes, whose HER performance hasn't been systematically studied yet. It is found that Te nanoflakes transferred on carbon fiber paper (CFP) exhibit impressive HER properties and show a load dependence. The overpotential required for HER is significantly reduced to 279 mV under a load condition of 0.86 mg cm −2 at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further systematically carried out on Te catalytic sites along the helical chain at [0001] direction with a threefold screw symmetry. It is found that the Gibbs free energy of adsorbed hydrogen atom (ΔG H* ) on Te sites is significantly lower than that of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ). Besides, the active sites based on surface atom density calculation reveal that Te provides more adsorption sites than layered MoS 2 . The decreased adsorption energy and efficient adsorption sites in Te may highlight the promising application of elemental crystal Te in electrocatalytic hydrogen production and pave the way for developing new types of electrocatalysts.

Abstract Water electrolyzers powered by renewable energy are emerging as clean and sustainable technology for producing hydrogen without carbon emissions. Specifically, anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzers utilizing non‐platinum group metal (non‐PGM) catalysts have garnered attention as a cost‐effective method for hydrogen production, especially when integrated with solar cells. Nonetheless, the progress of such integrated systems is hindered by inadequate water electrolysis efficiency, primarily caused by poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes. To address this issue, a NiFeCo─OOH has developed as an OER electrocatalyst and successfully demonstrated its efficacy in an AEM electrolyzer, which is powered by renewable electricity and integrated with a silicon solar cell.

There is growing acknowledgment that the properties of the electrochemical interfaces play an increasingly pivotal role in improving the performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we present, for the first time, direct dynamic spectral evidence illustrating the impact of the interaction between interfacial water molecules and adsorbed hydroxyl species (OHad) on the HER properties of Ni(OH)2 using Au/core-Ni(OH)2/shell nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Notably, our findings highlight that the interaction between OHad and interfacial water molecules promotes the formation of weakly hydrogen-bonded water, fostering an environment conducive to improving the HER performance. Furthermore, the participation of OHad in the reaction is substantiated by the observed deprotonation step of Au@2 nm Ni(OH)2 during the HER process. This phenomenon is corroborated by the phase transition of Ni(OH)2 to NiO, as verified through Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The significant redshift in the OH-stretching frequency of water molecules during the phase transition confirms that surface OHad disrupts the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water molecules. Through manipulation of the shell thickness of Au@Ni(OH)2, we additionally validate the interaction between OHad and interfacial water molecules. In summary, our insights emphasize the potential of electrochemical interfacial engineering as a potent approach to enhance electrocatalytic performance.

Defect engineering has been widely applied in semiconductors to improve photocatalytic properties by altering the surface structures. This study is about the transformation of inactive WO 3 nanosheets to a highly effective CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion photocatalyst by introducing surface-ordered defects in abundance. The nonstoichiometric WO 3- x samples were examined by using aberration-corrected electron microscopy. Results unveil abundant surface-ordered terminations derived from the periodic {013} stacking faults with a defect density of 20.2%. The {002} surface-ordered line defects are the active sites for fixation CO 2 , transforming the inactive WO 3 nanosheets into a highly active catalyst (CH 4 : O 2 = 8.2: 16.7 μmol h −1 ). We believe that the formation of the W-O-C-W-O species is a critical step in the catalytic pathways. This work provides an atomic-level comprehension of the structural defects of catalysts for activating small molecules.

The quest to identify precious metal free hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts has received unprecedented attention in the past decade. In this Review, we focus our attention to recent developments in precious metal free hydrogen evolution reactions in acidic and alkaline electrolyte owing to their relevance to commercial and near-commercial low-temperature electrolyzers. We provide a detailed review and critical analysis of catalyst activity and stability performance measurements and metrics commonly deployed in the literature, as well as review best practices for experimental measurements (both in half-cell three-electrode configurations and in two-electrode device testing). In particular, we discuss the transition from laboratory-scale hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst measurements to those in single cells, which is a critical aspect crucial for scaling up from laboratory to industrial settings but often overlooked. Furthermore, we review the numerous catalyst design strategies deployed across the precious metal free HER literature. Subsequently, we showcase some of the most commonly investigated families of precious metal free HER catalysts; molybdenum disulfide-based, transition metal phosphides, and transition metal carbides for acidic electrolyte; nickel molybdenum and transition metal phosphides for alkaline. This includes a comprehensive analysis comparing the HER activity between several families of materials highlighting the recent stagnation with regards to enhancing the intrinsic activity of precious metal free hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts. Finally, we summarize future directions and provide recommendations for the field in this area of electrocatalysis.

The design of cost-effective electrocatalysts is an open challenging for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the "stable-or-active" dilemma. Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), a versatile and low-cost material that can be stable under OER operating conditions, exhibits inherently poor OER activity from experimental observations. Herein, we doped a series of metal elements to regulate the ZrO2 catalytic activity in OER via spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with van der Waals interactions. Microkinetic modeling as a function of the OER activity descriptor (GO*-GHO*) displays that 16 metal dopants enable to enhance OER activities over a thermodynamically stable ZrO2 surface, among which Fe and Rh (in the form of single-atom dopant) reach the volcano peak (i.e. the optimal activity of OER under the potential of interest), indicating excellent OER performance. Free energy diagram calculations, density of states, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations further showed that Fe and Rh are the effective dopants for ZrO2, leading to low OER overpotential, high conductivity, and good stability. Considering cost-effectiveness, single-atom Fe doped ZrO2 emerged as the most promising catalyst for OER. This finding offers a valuable perspective and reference for experimental researchers to design cost-effective catalysts for the industrial-scale OER production.

The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is the core component of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which is the place where the reaction occurrence, the multiphase material transfer and the energy conversion, and the development of MEA with high activity and long stability are crucial for the practical application of PEMFCs. Currently, efforts are devoted to developing the regulation of MEA nanostructure engineering, which is believed to have advantages in improving catalyst utilization, maximizing three-phase boundaries, enhancing mass transport, and improving operational stability. This work reviews recent research progress on platinum group metal (PGM) and PGM-free catalysts with multidimensional nanostructures, catalyst layers (CLs), and nano-MEAs for PEMFCs, emphasizing the importance of structure-function relationships, aiming to guide the further development of the performance for PEMFCs. Then the design strategy of the MEA interface is summarized systematically. In addition, the application of in situ and operational characterization techniques to adequately identify current density distributions, hot spots, and water management visualization of MEAs is also discussed. Finally, the limitations of nanostructured MEA research are discussed and future promising research directions are proposed. This paper aims to provide valuable insights into the fundamental science and technical engineering of efficient MEA interfaces for PEMFCs.

In this study, we employ density functional theory to analyze the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of FeTPyP/Au(111) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and their bimetallic-organic counterpart, FeTPyP + Co/Au(111), synthesized via Co atom sublimation. Our investigation focuses on elucidating the mechanistic roles of various metal active sites, thereby establishing a correlation between the local chemical environment and the electronic properties of the active metal centers. We find that the FeTPyP + Co/Au(111) system exhibits sites with a more balanced adsorption behavior for ORR intermediates compared to FeTPyP/Au(111), which leads us to conclude that the former demonstrates enhanced ORR catalytic activity. Additionally, we introduce a methodology for rapid evaluation of the ORR performance based on the electronic structure of the metal active sites.

The development of high-performance and low-cost alkaline hydrogen precipitation catalysts is critical for the large-scale application of hydrogen energy. In this work, the nanoporous alloy catalysts were synthesized by dealloying melt-spun NiZrPt ribbons. The optimal sample after dealloying shows excellent HER performance in alkaline medium, with a small overpotential of 15 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 20 mV/dec. The material characterization reveals that the incorporation of Ni modulates the electronic structure of Pt. After selective dealloying of Zr and Ni, a Pt-enriched nanoporous structure was formed on the catalyst surface. Meanwhile, the remaining Ni sites acted as synergistic sites to activate the Pt sites, which allowed for better hydrogen adsorption energy and faster kinetics of the catalytic reaction. Besides, the favorable mechanical flexibility of the material makes it potential for self-supporting electrode. This work presents a way to prepare low-Pt efficient catalysts by amorphous alloy dealloying.

Hydrogen energy plays an important role in achieving green and low-carbon transformation and development. It is a feasible method to produce clean hydrogen by solar irradiation. In this paper, a new type of InN/BTe van der Waals heterojunction is designed based on density functional theory. The calculated results show that the lattice mismatch of the heterojunction is less than 2% and has good stability, which is beneficial to the experimental synthesis. Under light irradiation, the transfer path of electrons and holes generated by light excitation is Z-scheme mechanism, which accumulates in BTe conduction band and InN valence band with stronger redox activity, respectively, and improves the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrolysis. The InN/BTe heterojunction under the standard hydrogen electrode can achieve complete decomposition of water and spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction. The high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (up to 17.92%) and electron mobility (1820.54 cm2/Vs) indicate that the InN/BTe heterojunction is a promising photocatalytic material.

Abstract A computational screening of Single Atom Catalysts (SACs) bound to titanium nitride (TiN) is presented, for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), based on density functional theory. The role of fundamental ingredients is explored to account for a reliable screening of SACs. Namely, the formation of H 2 ‐complexes besides the classical H * one impacts the predicted HER activity, in line with previous studies on other SACs. Also, the results indicate that one needs to adopt self‐interaction‐corrected functionals. Finally, predicting an active catalyst is of little help without an assessment of its stability. Thus, it is included in the theoretical framework the analysis of the stability of the SACs in working conditions of pH and voltage. Once unconventional intermediates and stability are considered in a self‐interaction corrected scheme, the number of potential good catalysts for HER is strongly reduced since i) some potentially good catalysts are not stable against dissolution and ii) the formation of unconventional intermediates leads to thermodynamic barriers. This study highlights the importance of including ingredients for the prediction of new systems, such as the formation of unconventional intermediates, estimating the stability of SACs, and the adoption of self‐interaction corrected functionals. Also, this study highlights some interesting candidates deserving of dedicated work.

The design of highly efficient and robust non-noble metal water splitting catalysts for hydrogen production is crucial to reduce overpotential and energy consumption. Herein, a strategy for in-situ growth of halogen-doped NiCoP (X-NiCoP/NF, X = F, Cl, and Br) catalysts with special morphology on nickel foam is proposed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the downshift of the d-band center energy can regulate the charge distribution of NiCoP owing to doping of strong electronegativity halogen, thus optimizing the Gibbs free energy of H* absorption (△GH*). The F-NiCoP/NF catalyst achieves remarkable HER activity under alkaline conditions, with overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η10) of 59 mV and Tafel slope of 48.9 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, F-doping significantly increases the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and turnover frequency (TOF), suggestive of the F promotes the formation of highly dispersed high intrinsic active sites. The F-NiCoP/NF exhibits excellent stability with a negligible decrease in activity after durability tests. This work sheds light on the facile synthesis of highly active and stable catalysts with strong electronegative atom doping for HER.

The PtCo/C electrocatalyst obtained by the method of simultaneous reduction of metal precursors using sodium borohydride was treated at a temperature of 350 ˚C in an argon atmosphere for 1 hour. The results of X-ray phase analysis and transmission electron microscopy indicate an increase in the average size of crystallites and the formation of nanoparticle agglomerates after heat treatment. The shift in the reflection of Pt (111) after treatment indicates the possible segregation of metal components during the heating of the sample. An increase in the catalyst activity after heat treatment is shown, both mass activity and specific activity. The stability of the sample after heat treatment, according to the results of the stress test in the potential range of 0.6–1.4 V, showed a higher value than the material in the “as prepared” state.

Thermal properties of materials are essential to many applications of thermal electronic devices. Density functional theory (DFT) has shown capability in obtaining an accurate calculation. However, the expensive computational cost limits the application of the DFT method for high-throughput screening of materials. Recently, machine learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated high accuracy in many material properties’ prediction, such as bandgap and formation energy, but fail to accurately predict heat capacity(CV) due to the limitation in capturing crystallographic features. In our study, we have implemented the material informatics transformer (MatInFormer) framework, which has been pretrained on lattice reconstruction tasks. This approach has shown proficiency in capturing essential crystallographic features. By concatenating these features with human-designed descriptors, we achieved a mean absolute error of 4.893 and 4.505 J/(mol K) in our predictions. Our findings underscore the efficacy of the MatInFormer framework in leveraging crystallography, augmented with additional information processing capabilities.
