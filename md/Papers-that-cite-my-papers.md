Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction holds the great potential to convert excess emissions of carbon footprint into high value-added chemicals, but its activity, selectivity, stability, and reproducibility are still far away from satisfactory. The molecular catalysts with precise structures are unique platform to decipher the electrocatalytic mechanism, but they usually suffer from low performance. Herein, we report a strain-optimized dual copper complex immobilized in mesoporous carbon, which exhibits remarkable ethylene (C2H4) Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 49.9% along with a multicarbon (C2+) product's FE up to 65.2% at -1.19 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Concurrently, the catalyst displays considerable stability for 15 hours at a full cell potential of -3.1 volts. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the strain effect imposed by mesoporous carbon regulates the neighboring dual copper sites in the electrocatalyst to decrease the energy barrier of rate-determining step (*COCO → *COCOH), thus significantly promoting ethylene production.

## Atomic-Level Insight into Ni Clusters Supported on N-Terminated Diamond (111) Surface for HER, OER, and ORR

Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs), an emerging frontier between single-atom catalysts and conventional metal nanoparticle catalysts, have attracted significant attention due to their unique geometric and electronic structures. Herein, we systematically investigate the structural models and the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER), oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) performances for Nix clusters (x = 2-9) anchored on a N-terminated diamond (111) surface (Nix@ND) through Crystal structure AnaLYsis by Particle Swarm Optimization (CALYPSO)-based structural prediction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ni-H bonding strength serves as a critical descriptor for HER activity, where a balanced relative strength of ad-/desorption is beneficial for enhancing it. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG*H) of the Ni7@ND catalyst is -0.25 eV, demonstrating optimal HER performance with an efficiency approaching that of highly efficient Pt-based catalysts. Furthermore, Ni4@ND and Ni2@ND catalysts demonstrate superior OER and ORR performance with low overpotentials (η), which are significantly lower than those of single-atom catalyst Ni1@ND. Volcano curve analysis reveals that the OER performance is maximized at the intermediate adsorption strength of key reaction species (*O, *OH). A pronounced linear correlation is found between ηORR and adsorption energies of intermediate *OH. Furthermore, size effects in SCCs narrow the band gap and increase the number of active sites, thus promoting the catalytic performance (optimizing charge redistribution and reducing the rate-determining step barrier). This design strategy provides atomic-level insights into highly efficient diamond-based SCCs for HER, OER, and ORR.

[Yachao Zhang](https://openalex.org/A5100667174), The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(11)] 2025.https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0285574.
    
2D gallium nitride possesses distinctive electronic states, making it ideal for future optoelectronic devices because of the quantum confinement and enhanced many-body interactions inherent in its atomically thin form. This study explores the impact of molecular doping with Fe(II)-porphyrin (FeP) on these characteristics using first-principle calculations. Contact of the magnetic center Fe with the nitrogen site causes a 17% decrease in the energy barrier for the transition from intermediate spin (S = 1) to high spin (S = 2) state, highlighting the sensitivity of spin dynamics to doping sites. Molecular diffusion barriers increase by 9.6 kJ/mol upon spin transition, suggesting that the spin state influences molecular mobility within the material. Exploring spectral functions reveals that FeP doping introduces spin-dependent molecule levels within the bandgap, which may play a role in electron-hole separation and spin injection. In addition, we show that the molecule-substrate coupling lowers the exciton binding energy by 0.1 eV, with further reduction during spin transitions. This weakening is attributed to increased electron mobility, quantified by static polarizability. These results indicate that the molecular spin state can control electronic excitations within substrate materials, presenting a promising strategy for designing spintronic devices.

The quest for sustainable and high-efficiency energy conversion technologies has driven intense research into oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, particularly those based on noble metals, due to the harsh redox environment of these devices. Despite their unparalleled activity, the scarcity and high cost of noble metals like platinum remain significant bottlenecks for large-scale application. Recent advances in surface and interface engineering of noble metal heterostructures offer a promising pathway to address these challenges. By precisely tailoring surface atomic arrangements, modulating interfacial electronic structures, and constructing synergistic heterojunctions, researchers have unlocked unprecedented catalytic efficiencies with dramatically reduced metal loading. This review systematically explores the latest strategies in designing surface- and interface-optimized noble metal heterostructures for ORR, highlighting how these innovations enable maximum utilization of active sites while enhancing activity and durability. We delve into various synthesis techniques, structural modulation approaches, and mechanistic insights gained from advanced characterization and theoretical modeling. Special emphasis is placed on understanding the critical role of heterointerfaces in tuning adsorption energies, charge transfer dynamics, and reaction pathways. Finally, we outline current challenges and propose future directions for the rational design of next-generation ORR catalysts that combine minimal noble metal usage with exceptional performance.

Abstract Rational design of an efficient catalyst that simultaneously accelerates water splitting, promotes hydroxyl conversion, and facilitates hydrogen desorption presents a significant challenge for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To address this challenge, a series of coordinating metals selected from elements of the 4th‐ and 5th‐period is incorporated into dicobalt phosphide (Co 2 P), thereby tuning the interfacial adsorption. Among these elements‐coordinated catalysts, simultaneously considering both d ‐band filling and spin polarization, the iron‐coordinated catalyst (Fe‐CPNCF) exhibits appropriate adsorption energy, activates interfacial inert H 2 O molecules and locates at the optimal position on the volcano plot for the H 2 O dissociation barrier, owing to the rational d ‐orbitals modulation of active sites by Fe coordination. Thus, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers based on Fe‐CPNCF achieve a current density of 2 A cm −2 at a low cell voltage of 2.04 V and maintain stable electrolysis for 1160 h, demonstrating great potential in commercial applications. This work underscores the importance of rationally tuning the d‐ orbitals of active sites for modulating interfacial adsorption behavior, providing relevant insights for the development of efficient hydrogen evolution catalysts.

Multireference methods such as multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory accurately capture electronic correlation in systems with strong multiconfigurational character, but their cost precludes direct use in molecular dynamics. Combining these methods with machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can extend their reach. However, the sensitivity of multireference calculations to the choice of the active space complicates the consistent evaluation of energies and gradients across structurally diverse nuclear configurations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the weighted active space protocol (WASP), a systematic approach to assign a consistent active space for a given system across uncorrelated configurations. By integrating WASP with MLPs and enhanced sampling techniques, we propose a data-efficient active learning cycle that enables the training of an MLP on multireference data. We demonstrated the approach on the TiC+-catalyzed C-H activation of methane, a reaction that poses challenges for Kohn-Sham density functional theory due to its significant multireference character. This framework enables accurate and efficient modeling of catalytic dynamics, establishing a paradigm for simulating complex reactive processes beyond the limits of conventional electronic-structure methods.

Abstract In this work, a robust method is presented for synthesizing homogeneously distributed, ultrafine PtCu atomic clusters supported on Cu‐modified, vacancy‐engineered Mo 4/3 B 2 T z MBene nanosheets (PtCu AC @Cu‐Mo 4/3 B 2 T z ). The material serves as highly efficient pH‐universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, which demonstrates impressively low overpotentials of 4 and 15 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, as well as sustained operational stability. Through comprehensive analysis of in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory, it is realizes that Cu incorporation optimizes the electronic configuration of Pt sites and significantly enhances proton transfer and interfacial water activation. In addition, the active metal‐MBene interactions also leads to modulation in the d‐band center of Pt d‐orbitals, fine‐tuning the adsorption energy of H * and reducing the energy barrier for water dissociation, thus promoting H 2 evolution. The practical tests demonstrate high‐performance anion exchange membrane single‐cell stack based on PtCu AC @Cu‐Mo 4/3 B 2 T z(−) ||RuO 2(+) configuration, reaching current densities of 0.5/1.0 A cm −2 at 1.75/1.86 V and stable performance for over 600 h at 0.5 A cm −2 in 1.0 M KOH at 60 °C. This research underscores the importance of active metal‐supported MBene in enhancing catalytic functions and demonstrates the key role of next‐generation MBene‐based hybrid materials as durable support for electrocatalysts.

Tailoring the nanoscale distribution of chemical species at grain boundaries is a powerful method to dramatically influence the properties of polycrystalline materials. However, classical approaches to the problem have tacitly assumed that only competition is possible between solute species. In this paper, we show that solute elements can cooperate in the way they segregate to grain boundaries: In properly targeted alloys, the different chemical species cooperate to each fill complementary grain boundary sites disfavored by the other. By developing a theoretical “spectral” approach to this problem based on quantum-accurate grain boundary site distributions, we show how grain boundaries can be cooperatively alloyed, whether by depletion or enrichment. We provide machine-learned cosegregation information for over 700 ternary aluminum-based alloys and experimentally validate the concept in one ternary alloy where cosegregation is not expected by prior models but is expected based on the cooperative model.

Abstract In this work, copper-doped Electrocatalyst was synthesized via pyrolysis, and the electrocatalyst was characterized by XRD, FTIR, and XPS, followed by electrochemical testing. Also, a new electrocatalyst for metal-air batteries was designed, and reaction processes are predicted using large language models (LLMs) such as ChemBERT and ChemGPT. To train the models, RDKit was used to process SMILES representations of functional groups, doping techniques, and electrolyte media. While ChemGPT produced new electrocatalysts with an accuracy of 0.83, ChemBERT, which had been optimized to 0.8, was used to predict mechanisms. To speed up catalyst identification, the methodology incorporates reaction pathway predictions.

Selective valorization of biomass feedstocks and their derivatives, using renewable electricity to produce value-added chemicals, is a promising route to decarbonize the chemical industry. Herein, we demonstrate the selective production of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from the electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). NiCo2S4 as an anode electrode exhibits almost 100% yield of FDCA with >90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) and high stability at optimized conditions, which outperforms pure NiSx and CoSx. Theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced reaction kinetics for HMF conversion to FDCA on NiCo2S4 arises from an optimal OH coverage and a more exergonic rate-limiting step compared with its monometallic counterparts. A techno-economic analysis (TEA) for a 100-ton/day FDCA industrial scale production facility reveals that the NiCo2S4 catalyst could drive economic feasibility of the process. This work provides an economically feasible approach to sustainably produce FDCA from HMF oxidation by electrocatalysis.

Abstract Recent experiments indicate that the methanol selectivity in the CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol on copper is sensitive toward the catalyst structure, yet the mechanistic origins of such an effect remain unclear. In this study, we employ DFT calculations and statistical thermodynamics to elucidate the role of different copper catalyst facets in governing the product selectivity toward CO or methanol. Our analysis shows that both MeOH and rWGS reactions are structure‐sensitive, agreeing with UHV experiments on clean copper surfaces. More interestingly, our study reveals that the competition between the two catalytic cycles is dependent on the catalyst structure: Cu(110) promotes methanol formation via a formate‐mediated mechanism without any CO*‐based intermediates, while Cu(111) favors CO formation via a newly proposed formate‐to‐carboxyl isomerization route. This distinction arises from the different activation tendencies of the key HCOOH* surface intermediate on each surface, driven by different adsorbate and transition‐state stabilization effects. Our findings rationalize the experimental observations by supporting the hypothesis that different Cu facets exhibit a strong propensity toward enabling distinct catalytic cycles, leading to different product formation on them. As such, this work highlights the importance of accounting for structural information in the microkinetic analysis of CO 2 hydrogenation pathways.

Abstract The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide () allows both the reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the storage of intermittent renewable energy. While modeling studies have focused on the catalyst for at least two decades, recently the electrolyte–electrode interface has attracted significant attention, especially metal cations. In this Perspective, we propose simple rules to predict the extent of cation effects on and water reduction depending on the transition metal catalyst, which we later extend to the case of alkali cation‐induced surface dissolution. First, we highlight the difficulty of activating and the crucial boost that cations provide for late transition metals. Then we re‐interpret state‐of‐the‐art results in terms of a unique descriptor, i.e ., cation‐induced electrostatic potential. Finally, we suggest a possible qualitative explanation for cation effects in cathodic dissolution and mention strategies to overcome cation‐induced salt formation. The final Outlook lists directions that the modeling field should follow, i.e ., either simplicity (Computational Cation Electrode) or complexity (Multiscale models), showing the potential of simulations toward the understanding of novel electrochemical processes ( i.e ., in organic cations).

Abstract Bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced catalytic performance through synergistic interactions between the two metals, allowing them to break the linear scaling relations and reach high electrocatalytic activity. This study presents bimetallic aerogel‐based catalyst synthesized as a covalent, three‐dimensional framework containing neighboring iron and manganese sites. The aerogel structure provides a high surface area and porosity, facilitating an ultra‐high active site density and efficient mass transport. The MnFe porphyrrole's unique structure is obtained by alternately linking Mn‐porphyrin and Fe‐corrole complexes. It exhibited outstanding performance with an onset potential of 0.99 V RHE . Comparative studies with a free‐base Fe porphyrrole catalyst ( E onset 0.97 V RHE ) revealed that while Mn incorporation led to only a slight improvement in half‐cell performance, it resulted in significantly enhanced performance in anion exchange membrane fuel cell. The MnFe catalyst achieved an OCV of 0.97 V and a peak power density of 0.27 W cm − 2 , outperforming the free‐base Fe counterpart. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that the higher ORR activity of MnFe‐porphyrrole is due to charge transfer between Mn and Fe atoms, which is absent in the reference free‐base Fe‐porphyrrole. These findings underscore the advantages of bimetallic catalysts in improving ORR activity and fuel cell efficiency by leveraging synergistic effects.

Abstract Carbon allotropes are crucial to advanced interfaces to control friction and wear because of their unique range of mechanical properties: from diamond's hardness to graphite's lubricity. Friction force microscopy (FFM) is reported for diamond tips sliding on SiC(0001)‐supported epitaxial graphene. A sharp friction increase is observed at a threshold normal force, linked to an intermittent graphene rehybridization. Comparing the FFM response of a diamond tip to that of a previously studied silicon tip with a comparable radius reveals a similar abrupt friction increase, though at roughly half the threshold force. Atomistic simulations of SiC(0001)‐supported graphene sliding against hydroxylated amorphous carbon (a‐C) and silicon oxide show low shear stress at low pressures for both systems. The shear stress increases at higher pressures due to bond formation between graphene and the counterbody. For a‐C, the transition threshold shifts to higher pressures, consistent with FFM results. In simulations with high normal pressures, epitaxial graphene undergoes a structural transformation into single‐layer diamond, contributing to the abrupt increase in friction. The graphene structure recovers after lifting the a‐C counterbody, demonstrating structural robustness under tribological stress. These findings provide insights into the stability of low‐friction interfaces between epitaxial graphene and key materials for current micro‐electro‐mechanical systems (MEMS)

CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2ER) to multicarbon products is an effective method to reduce carbon emissions and achieve sustainable energy development. However, most CO2ER systems mainly convert CO2 into C1 products, while the main electrocatalysts for generating C2 products (such as C2H4, C2H6, C2H5OH, etc.) are Cu-based materials. Herein, a Fe-based composite (Fe3O4/Fe1–xS) is constructed via in situ sulfidation of Fe2O3. Using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6) acetonitrile (MeCN) solution as the electrolyte, the resultant Fe3O4/Fe1–xS with an optimal component ratio exhibits excellent CO2ER activity and stability with a current density of 35 mA cm–2 and C2H6 Faradaic efficiency (FE(C2H6)) of up to 67.5% at −1.60 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is much higher than the maximum values of pure Fe3O4 (3.5%) and Fe1–xS (36.7%). Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that [Bmim]PF6 can reduce the activation energy of CO2 molecules and stabilize the *CO intermediate, while the synergistic effect of the electroactive Fe3+-substitution defects (FeFe•) in nonstoichiometric Fe1–xS and the Fe3O4/Fe1–xS interface plays a critical role in promoting the protonation of the *CO intermediate to form *CHO, asymmetric *CO–*CHO coupling, and then continuous dehydration and protonation to generate C2H6. These findings provide valuable insights for improving the CO2ER performance of Fe-based catalysts for the production of multicarbon products.

The development of effective catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for improving the performance of fuel cells. Efficient carbon-supported Pt-Co nanocatalysts were successfully prepared by a generic two-step method: (i) electroless deposition of a Co-P coating on Vulcan XC72R carbon powder and (ii) subsequent spontaneous partial galvanic replacement of Co by Pt, upon immersion of the Co/C precursor in a chloroplatinate solution. The prepared Pt-Co particles (of a core-shell structure) are dispersed on a Vulcan XC-72 support, forming agglomerates made of nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm. The composition and surface morphology of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crystal structures of the Co-P/C precursor and Pt-Co/C catalyst were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). XPS analysis was performed to study the chemical state of the surface layers of the precursor and catalyst. The electrochemical behavior of the Pt-Co/C composites was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments were used to assess the catalytic activity towards the ORR and compared with that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The Pt-Co/C catalysts exhibit mass-specific and surface-specific activities (of jm = 133 mA mg−1 and jesa = 0.661 mA cm−2, respectively) at a typical overpotential value of 380 mV (+0.85 V vs. RHE); these are superior to those of similar electrodes made of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (jm = 50.6 mA mg−1; jesa = 0.165 mA cm−2). The beneficial effect of even small (<1% wt.%) quantities of Co in the catalyst on Pt ORR activity may be attributed to an optimum catalyst composition and particle size resulting from the proposed preparation method.

Atomic-scale quantum conductance switches based on metallic quantum point contacts allow controlled binary switching of the electrical current between a conducting “on state” and a non-conducting “off state” via an independent gate electrode. Although silver-based quantum switches operate via electrochemical conductance modulation, the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed density functional theory combined with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) framework to investigate nitrate anion adsorption on Ag(100), Ag(111), and Ag(511) surfaces under varying electrochemical potentials. The stable configurations of nitrate adsorption on the electrode surfaces as a function of electrode potential are determined using the grand canonical approach within the CHE framework, revealing the surface reconstruction of Ag(511) analogous to the formation of nascent Ag–NO3 complexes. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that the critical phase transition occurs in agreement with the experimental switching threshold. Electronic structure calculations reveal metallic to semiconducting transitions in the reconstructed Ag–NO3 complex layers, elucidating the mechanism of conductance modulation. The “off state” corresponds to insulating Ag–NO3 surface complexes, while the “on state” arises from metallic Ag–Ag bridging at lower nitrate coverage under lower control voltage. This study establishes a general framework for anion-mediated quantum switching in transition metals and provides a design for nanoscale electrochemical devices.

ABSTRACT Broadband light absorption, mechanical resilience, and efficient surface catalysis are all crucial for photocatalytic semiconductors, yet they are rarely improved together in one material. We combine first‐principles calculations with machine‐learning interpretability and Pearson correlation analyses to reveal that rare‐earth (La, Er) doping of Mg₂Si can synergistically enhance its optoelectronic, mechanical, and hydrogen‐evolution performance. La doping introduces conduction‐band impurity states via La‐5d/Si‐3p orbital hybridization, boosting sub‐bandgap (infrared) absorption by 60‐fold (~0.6 × 10 5 cm −1 ) and extending the absorption edge into the near‐infrared—translating to a solar‐to‐hydrogen conversion efficiency of up to 39.86%. It also percolates a metallic bond network that doubles the Poisson's ratio (0.23 → 0.46), transforming Mg₂Si from brittle to ductile. Er doping, in contrast, localizes 4f orbitals, yielding exciton‐like absorption peaks (~10 5 cm −1 ) in the ultraviolet and inducing a distinct electronic and mechanical response. Both dopants push the Fermi level into the conduction band (degenerate n‐type doping), fundamentally altering carrier characteristics. Catalytically, La doping generates delocalized sp 3 d 2 orbitals that give near‐thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption (Δ G H* ≈ −0.04 eV), outperforming noble‐metal catalysts, whereas Er's extended electron density enhances H binding at the cost of slower H₂ desorption. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis further identifies the key orbital and elastic descriptors governing these trends, providing a mechanistic blueprint.

## Computational Electrosynthesis: A Perspective on Mechanistic Questions, Methodological Approaches, and Elucidating the Role of the Electrical Double Layer

In this perspective, we discuss how modern computational chemistry techniques are utilized to elucidate electrosynthesis reaction mechanisms via the computation of kinetic rate parameters that depend on reaction conditions. The specific focus is on elementary reaction steps that occur within the electrical double layer (EDL) environment at the working electrode/electrolyte interface, for which the governing free energy profiles and rate constants can be explicitly computed from classical molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computer simulations with atomistic resolution of the EDL environment. We focus on direct electrolysis reactions at inert electrodes with prototypical "E-C-E" mechanisms, in which the reaction yield and selectivity may depend on whether the full process occurs heterogeneously within the EDL, or rather the steps following the initial electron transfer proceed homogeneously with the second electron transfer occurring via disproportionation (DISP pathway). For short-lived radical intermediates with lifetimes of ∼10–10–10–7 s, branching between heterogeneous E-C-E and homogeneous DISP pathways is dictated by rate constants for substrate/intermediate desorption from the electrode surface (e.g., kD ∼ 107–1010 s–1), which are difficult to determine experimentally but can be computed from molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss how strong solvophobic forces within electrolytes lead to significant association free energies between electrogenerated radical ion intermediates and the working electrode surface, resulting in residence times within the EDL that are on par with time constants of fast radical ion reactions. For electrosynthesis reactions that proceed entirely heterogeneously, the EDL environment can substantially modulate the reaction kinetics via electrostatic, solvophobic, and steric forces. We present several case studies highlighting modulated reaction kinetics within the EDL for nucleophilic coupling and deprotonation reactions of cation radical intermediates in anodic electrosynthesis. We expect that computational techniques will play an increasingly valuable role in optimizing electrosynthesis reactions via mechanistic descriptions of how key kinetic rate parameters are modulated by electrochemical reaction conditions.

Hydrogen absorption and desorption in solids are pivotal reactions involved in batteries and hydrogen storage devices. However, conventional thermodynamic and electrochemical hydrogen storage using high-capacity materials suffers from high hydrogen-desorption temperatures and instability of electrolytes. In this work, we explored electrochemical hydride ion (H – )–driven hydrogen storage and developed a solid electrolyte, anti–α-AgI–type Ba 0.5 Ca 0.35 Na 0.15 H 1.85 , which exhibits excellent H – conductivity and electrochemical stability. This electrolyte is compatible with several metal-hydrogen electrodes, such as titanim hydride and magnesium hydride (MgH 2 ), allowing for high-capacity, reversible hydrogen storage at low temperatures. Specifically, Mg–H 2 cells operating as hydrogen storage devices (Mg + H 2  ⇄  MgH 2 ) achieved a reversible capacity of 2030 milliampere hours per gram at 90°C, offering safe and efficient hydrogen-electricity conversion and hydrogen storage devices.

In this study, six-dimensional (6D) time-dependent wave packet calculations were employed to investigate the dissociation of HCl molecules on two bimetallic surfaces, Cu/Ag(111) and Cu/Au(111). These calculations were based on two accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs) constructed using neural network methodology. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the static barrier heights for HCl on Cu/Ag(111) and Cu/Au(111) were 0.32 eV and 0.28 eV, respectively. These values are significantly lower than the barrier height on pure Cu(111) (0.52 eV), primarily due to surface strain effects. However, it was found that the 6D dissociation probability of HCl in (v=0, 1, j=0) states on Cu/Au(111) was considerably lower, despite its barrier height being 0.04 eV lower than that for Cu/Ag(111). The underlying mechanism for this observation was attributed to the non-monotonic dependence of the minimum energy path (MEP) on the molecular orientation, which was induced by charge transfer effect for HCl+Cu/Au(111). In contrast, HCl+Cu/Ag(111) exhibited a monotonic dependence. These contrasting behaviors led to distinct differences in rotational alignment and excitation effects for the two reactions.

Abstract Clinical oncology grapples with persistent challenges, particularly the rapid onset of tumor resistance and the systemic limitations of conventional chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox). Despite its potency, Dox suffers from poor solubility, non‐specific distribution, and severe toxicity, often compromising therapeutic efficacy. Addressing these obstacles, this study explores cobalt‐aluminium layered double hydroxides (Co‐Al LDHs) as smart nanocarriers for targeted melanoma therapy. Capitalizing on their tunable structure, high drug‐loading capacity, and biocompatibility, Co‐Al LDHs facilitate enhanced encapsulation, sustained release, and selective tumor accumulation of Dox. Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses confirm robust molecular interactions between Dox and the LDH matrix, ensuring structural stability and favorable energetics for drug delivery. In vitro assays reveal significant cytotoxicity (≈80%) against melanoma cells and with minimal toxicity (≈8%) to normal muscle cells. Furthermore, in vivo evaluations using luciferase‐tagged B16‐F10 melanoma models demonstrate pronounced tumor inhibition and excellent systemic biocompatibility. Augmented by machine learning‐guided force field modelling, this platform also offers a predictive framework for engineering next‐generation nanotherapeutics. Together, these findings position Co‐Al LDHs as a promising frontier in nanomedicine, merging targeted delivery, controlled release, and computational precision to overcome current therapeutic barriers in melanoma treatment and beyond.

Abstract Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) offer a promising platform for efficient energy conversion and storage at reduced temperatures (<650 °C). However, the commercial viability of PCECs remains hindered by the limited durability and sluggish oxygen electrocatalysis at the air electrode. Herein, a high‐entropy perovskite oxide (HEPO), Pr 0.2 Ba 0.2 Sr 0.2 La 0.2 Nd 0.2 CoO 3‐δ (PBSLNC), in a nanofiber architecture is presented as a bifunctional air electrode material for reversible PCEC operation. The unique A‐site compositional complexity promotes defect tolerance, abundant oxygen vacancies, rapid surface exchange kinetics while maintaining exceptional phase stability in harsh environments. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the entropically modulated Co environment that enhances hydroperoxide adsorption—a key step for oxygen electrocatalysis, thereby facilitating both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. When deployed into a PCEC configuration, the PBSNLC nanofiber electrode achieves a peak power density of 1.4 W cm −2 at 650 °C and electrolysis current density of 3.98 A cm −2 at 650 °C, along with outstanding operational stability during continuous operation for over 1000 h. These findings provide valuable guidance for the strategic design of highly efficient and stable bifunctional air electrodes for PCECs.

Abstract A tandem electrocatalyst with dual‐active‐sites is anticipated to organize the coupling reaction between various intermediates from nitrate to ammonia. Herein, by engineering the metal nodes and ligands of Zr‐based metal–organic frameworks (Zr‐MOFs) with Fe‐porphyrins (Hemins) and diacetylene linkages, respectively, a tandem catalyst of diacetylene‐linked Zr–MOFs anchored Hemins has been achieved. The key point here is that the diacetylene linkages could serve as cofactors of Hemins to manage the nitrate to ammonia process via NO 2 − intermediates. In addition, the ultrathin Zr–MOFs nanosheet with a well‐defined open framework allows it to organize the shuttle diffusion and coupling reaction of various reactants between Hemins and diacetylene linkages in its deep interior. In detail, the NO 2 − desorbed from the Hemins could diffuse onto the diacetylene linkages to finish the following hydrogenation process to NH 3 . Therefore, such an ultrathin hybrid of diacetylene‐linked Zr–MOF@Hemin achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% with an ammonia yield of 240.9 µmol h −1 cm −2 at −0.5 V versus RHE. This work indicates the activity of diacetylene linkage in catalysis independent of graphdiyne‐based 2D structures by organizing it into the topological structure of Zr–MOFs, which expands the scope of graphdiyne in structure.

Abstract Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS) due to their high crystallinity, porosity and tunable structures. However, current COF‐based systems rely on cocatalysts, which suffer from low atomic utilization and poor distribution due to aggregation. In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) backward reaction severely undermines catalytic efficiency and stability in long time reaction. Herein, we present a strategy that combines atomically dispersed Pt sites anchored via N/O coordination within triazine‐based COFs and a gas‐liquid‐solid three‐phase interface‐assisted photocatalytic system to enhance both performance and durability. As a result, the Pt‐TBPyT‐COF achieves superior OWS performance with H 2 and O 2 evolution rates of 469.8 and 234.9 µmol·g −1 ·h −1 , respectively, and an apparent quantum yield of 8.91% at 450 nm. Notably, the OWS via gas‐liquid‐solid three‐phase interface‐assisted method effectively suppresses ORR backward reaction and reaches average rates as high as 568.7 and 284.3 µmol·g −1 ·h −1 for H 2 and O 2 in 5 h, respectively, and maintained stable photocatalytic activity over a 30 h continuous reaction. Further, density functional theory calculations and in situ experiments reveal that the single‐atoms Pt coordination accelerates *H desorption, while the triazine units in COFs benefits charge separation and reduced energy barriers of OER rate‐determining step.

Alkali metal cations (AMCs) are known to play pivotal roles in modulating electrocatalytic systems, significantly affecting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). While their macroscopic effects are well recognized, the molecular-level interactions of AMCs at the electrochemical interface remain poorly understood. Here, using constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that AMCs (Li+, Na+, and K+) act as molecular switches that trigger a pseudo-outer-sphere ORR mechanism. In this mechanism, surface-adsorbed water molecules serve as dynamic bridges that simultaneously mediate interfacial electron transfer and proton transport. As a result, the reactive zone extends beyond the catalyst surface, overcoming the spatial constraints of traditional inner-sphere pathways. Crucially, H2O2 is generated directly within the outer Helmholtz plane via reduction of AMC-O2 complexes, effectively bypassing the catalyst surface and avoiding over-reduction. This results in significantly enhanced selectivity and production efficiency. Our results demonstrate that AMCs activate interfacial coupling to unlock alternative reaction pathways, while concurrently elucidating the critical yet often overlooked role of solute molecules in governing electrocatalytic behavior. This work establishes a framework for the understanding of electrolyte-catalyst coupling and provides principles for designing next-generation electrochemical systems.    

    

## A double-U approach to more accurate metal adsorption energies on ceria

An empirical approach based on density functional theory (DFT)+U is proposed to provide adsorption energies for atoms of transition metals adsorbed on ceria that are more accurate than those found in the existing DFT literature. It involves applying an intermediate Hubbard U value to the Ce 4f states and another U value to the d states of the metal adatom that is optimized for each metal to match its calculated bulk cohesive energy with the experimental value. The results compare favorably with Campbell's calorimetric measurements of metal adsorption heats on CeO2(111). Thus, this approach produces metal adsorption energies on ceria that are more accurate in both the single-atom and the bulk limits. Furthermore, it preserves a common reference for Ce so that calculations involving different metals adsorbed on ceria, e.g., bimetallic and multimetallic clusters, can be analyzed on the same footing.

Fluorinated groups are widely applied substituents in medicinal and agricultural chemistry as well as materials sciences because the introduction of per- and polyfluorinated substituents allow the targeted tuning of molecules and materials properties, in general. In addition to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substituents, especially trifluoromethylheteroatom substituents have attracted increasing interest in recent years. The bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group (CF3)2N is an example for a trifluoromethylheteroatom substituent. It has been known since the middle of the last century and it has been used and tested in different fields of applications. This review summarizes the chemistry of the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group since its beginning up to the end of 2024. It focuses on the synthesis of (CF3)2N-containing compounds, precursors for the introduction of the (CF3)2N group, and follow-up reactions of (CF3)2N-containing molecules. The physicochemical properties of the (CF3)2N group and of bis(trifluoromethyl)amines are collected and potential applications that have been described are summarized, as well.

Magnetically responsive intelligent fibers represent a new class of smart materials that integrate magnetic components into flexible fiber systems, enabling remote actuation, real-time sensing, and self-powered operation under external magnetic fields. With advantages in flexibility, adaptability, and multifunctionality, they hold promise for wearable electronics, soft robotics, biomedical devices, and energy harvesting. This review highlights recent progress in their design, fabrication, and applications. We summarize magnetic materials used in fiber integration-including ferrites, metal alloys, rare-earth compounds, and 2D materials-focusing on structural and magnetic properties. Multi-physics coupling mechanisms such as magneto-mechanical, magnetoelectric, and magneto-optical effects are discussed as the basis of intelligent responses. Fabrication strategies, including extrusion-based printing, magnetic-field-assisted alignment, and surface modification, are evaluated for scalability, resolution, and material integration. Key challenges for commercialization, such as dispersion, biocompatibility, and mechanical stability under dynamic conditions, are also addressed. Finally, future directions are outlined, emphasizing multifunctional fibers with combined stimuli-responsiveness and integration into adaptive systems. This review aims to provide a framework for advancing magnetically responsive fibers and inspiring future innovations in smart fiber technologies.
