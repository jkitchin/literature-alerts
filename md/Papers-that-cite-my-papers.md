## Understanding AuPd Alloy Nanoparticle Structure under Vacuum Using DFT and Monte Carlo Methods

AuPd is a miscible metal alloy that is often used in catalysis. Supported AuPd catalysts, at high Au/Pd ratios, form single-atom alloys (SAAs) that have been shown to enhance rates and/or selectivities for many catalytic reactions, including (de)hydrogenations, hydrogenolysis, and C–C and C–O coupling reactions. While many computational studies have examined the stability of AuPd structures (the arrangement of atoms within the miscible alloy), most focused on generic alloys rather than SAAs and those that have closely investigated SAAs focused on single crystal surfaces. In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate exchange energies (swapping an Au atom with a Pd atom) in a 201-atom truncated octahedral nanoparticle model with a focus on particles with high Au/Pd ratios. We calculate these exchange energies as a function of Pd location within the nanoparticle, the number of Pd atoms neighboring and near those exchange sites, and the total Pd content in the nanoparticle. These DFT-calculated exchange energies are also used to inform simple physics-based models (in contrast to cluster expansion or neural network models) that show good agreement with DFT-calculated values with relatively few regressed parameters. These models are then implemented into Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to predict the nanoparticle structure as a function of composition and temperature. The results show that Pd prefers to be in the subsurface of nanoparticles and that Pd prefers to be isolated from itself within Au. Both observations agree well with prior experimental and computational studies of single-crystal systems. We also show that the overall composition of the nanoparticle influences exchange energies by changing the electronic properties (e.g., Fermi level) of the system, which is relevant as Pd has one fewer valence electron than Au. MC simulations show that, in a vacuum, Pd begins to populate the surface of these ∼2 nm nanoparticles at around 20 mol % Pd (at 298 K) and that the number of Pd surface monomers, desired for SAA applications, goes through a maximum near 40 mol % Pd. As the temperature increases, Pd is more prevalent at the surface, but the influence of temperature is relatively muted. While AuPd structures are known to change in the presence of reactive gases (e.g., CO or O2), these studies characterize the baseline thermodynamic arrangements that can be used to understand surface restructuring during catalyst characterization and reaction studies.

Abstract Modulating the coordination environment of active centers has been proven to be an effective strategy for tuning the activity and selectivity of single‐atom catalysts (SACs). However, most current research primarily focuses on altering non‐metallic elements coordinating with the single metal atom. In this study, a novel approach is presented by introducing various vacancies into the first coordination shell of single‐atom doped boron–carbon–nitride (BCN) catalysts, systematically evaluating their hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions performances. Results indicate that the introduction of vacancy defects enhances the stability of M‐B X C Y N Z structures. Furthermore, adjusting the coordinating atoms around metal sites modulates charge distribution, influencing the binding propensity of intermediates on the adsorption sites and promoting synergistic effects between metal and nonmetal, thereby altering catalytic activity. Specifically, among 147 M‐B X C Y N Z and M‐B X C Y N Z ‐vacancy structures, 17 catalysts with excellent HER performance have been identified. Notably, C‐vacancy modulated Ni‐BC 2 N exhibits an OER overpotential of only 0.36V, suggesting that Ni‐BC 2 N‐C1 may serve as an efficient multifunctional electrocatalyst for water‐splitting reactions. This work employs vacancy engineering to precisely modulate the first coordination shell of single‐atom catalysts, not only screening out efficient HER/OER electrocatalysts but also providing guidance for the development of potential BCN‐based multifunctional electrocatalysts.

Abstract 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a highly promising candidates for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. This study presents the synthesis, comprehensive linear optical, and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) characterization of a novel 2D vdW semiconductor SnP 2 Se 6 in its bulk single crystal form. It exhibits an indirect bandgap of ≈1.47 eV and an exceptional non‐resonant SHG coefficient of d 33 ∼ −222 ± 30 pm V −1 at a fundamental wavelength of 2 µm, which is ≈7 times larger than that of the commercial AgGaSe 2 with a comparable bandgap. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the linear and nonlinear optical properties exhibit reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements, revealing the chemical origin of the enhanced properties. Moreover, SnP 2 Se 6 can exhibit both type‐I and type‐II phase matching over a wide spectral range, fulfilling one of the key criteria for an ideal NLO crystal. These exceptional properties position SnP 2 Se 6 as a highly promising candidate for NLO applications.

The synergistic Cu0-Cu+ sites is regarded as the active species towards NH3 synthesis from the nitrate electrochemical reduction reaction (NO3-RR) process. However, the mechanistic understanding and the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ remain exclusive. The big obstacle is that it is challenging to effectively regulate the interfacial motifs of Cu0-Cu+ sites. In this paper, we describe the tunable construction of Cu0-Cu+ interfacial structure by modulating the size-effect of Cu2O nanocube electrocatalysts to NO3-RR performance. We elucidate the formation mechanism of Cu0-Cu+ motifs by correlating the macroscopic particle size with the microscopic coordinated structure properties, and identify the synergistic effect of Cu0-Cu+ motifs on NO3-RR. Based on the rational design of Cu0-Cu+ interfacial electrocatalyst, we develop an efficient paired-electrolysis system to simultaneously achieve the efficient production of NH3 and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid at an industrially relevant current densities (2 A cm−2), while maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies, high yield rates, and long-term operational stability in a 100 cm2 electrolyzers, indicating promising practical applications. It is challenging to regulate the interfacial motifs of Cu0-Cu+ sites to understand roles of Cu0 and Cu+ for nitrate electrochemical reduction reaction. Here, the authors report a tunable construction of Cu0-Cu+ interfacial structure by modulating the size-effect of Cu2O electrocatalysts.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have displayed unprecedented activity and selectivity for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, a series of metal single atoms embedded on nitrogen-doped graphene (M–N4G, where M = In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, and Bi) is systematically evaluated as CO2RR electrocatalysts by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The computational results show that most M–N4G exhibit better CO2RR selectivity over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ge/Pb–N4G exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in the generation of HCOOH from the CO2RR with low limiting potentials of −0.292 and −0.306 eV, which surpass the performance of the vast majority of electrocatalysts. Adsorption energy of the key intermediate *HCOO can be used as an effective reactivity reaction descriptor to screen promising CO2RR catalysts. The results of this work highlight M–N4G as an ideal electrochemical for the electrocatalytic CO2RR.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR), with its low thermodynamic potential, offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for efficient hydrogen production. However, its sluggish kinetics still demand the development of an efficient electrocatalyst. In this study, the critical role of Ru doping in Fe₂TiO₅ is demonstrated to accelerate UOR kinetics. The computational finding confirmed the feasibility of this approach, guiding the experimental synthesis of Fe2-xRuxTiO5. Benefitting from surface properties and electronic structure, the synthesized material exhibits superior performance with a potential of 1.30 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for UOR, compared to undoped Fe2TiO5 (1.40 V). Moreover, it demonstrates a favourable Tafel slope of 52 mV dec-1 and maintains robust durability for 72 h. As confirmed from experimental and computational findings, the enhanced activity can be attributed to the Ru doping resulting in structural distortion at the Fe site and creation of a favourable adsorption site thereby enhancing UOR via dual active center. This study not only broadens the potential applications of Fe2TiO5-based materials beyond their traditional role as photocatalysts but also establishes them as promising electrocatalysts underscoring the versatility and improved performance of Fe2-xRuxTiO5.

The development of highly active metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) is crucial for energy conversion and storage, offering optimized atom utilization and high catalytic activity, with bifunctional SACs for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) reactions providing greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness than monofunctional catalysts, making them scientifically and economically valuable. By integrating density functional theory and machine learning methods, we systematically evaluated the potential of TM–N2@C15N5S3H5 monolayers as efficient HER/OER/ORR catalysts, revealing that 27 TM atoms remain stable on N2@C15N5S3H5 with a TM–N2 coordination environment. Rh–N2@C15N5S3H5 outperforms Pt in HER, while Rh–N2@C15N5S3H5 drives both HER and OER, while Ni–N2@C15N5S3H5 catalyzes OER and ORR, making them bifunctional catalysts. Comparative activity analysis reveals that the Ni-d orbitals in Ni–N2@C15N5S3H5 interact with O-p orbitals, pairing up electrons from antibonding states into downward bonding orbitals, thus fitting OH* adsorption and enhancing catalytic performance. We further examined the pH and applied potential effects on OER/ORR performance of Ni–N2@C15N5S3H5 and Rh–N2@C15N5S3H5 monolayers, both show enhanced OER in acidic conditions, with Ni–N2@C15N5S3H5 excelling in ORR under alkaline conditions and Rh–N2@C15N5S3H5 in acidic conditions. Moreover, machine learning techniques were applied to explore the correlation between catalytic activity and a range of structural and atomic properties.

Abstract Developing efficient and sustainable carbon sorbent for mercury vapor (Hg 0 ) capture is significant to public health and ecosystem protection. Here we show a carbon material, namely graphdiyne with accessible sp -hybridized carbons (HsGDY), that can serve as an effective “trap” to anchor Hg atoms by strong electron-metal-support interaction, leading to the in-situ adsorption-coupled-oxidation of Hg. The adsorption process is benefited from the large hexagonal pore structure of HsGDY. The oxidation process is driven by the surface charge heterogeneity of HsGDY which can itself induce the adsorbed Hg atoms to lose electrons and present a partially oxidized state. Its good adaptability and excellent regeneration performance greatly broaden the applicability of HsGDY in diverse scenarios such as flue gas treatment and mercury-related personal protection. Our work demonstrates a sp -hybridized carbon material for mercury vapor capture which could contribute to sustainability of mercury pollution industries and provide guide for functional carbon material design.

Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis is a core reaction in renewable energy devices, greatly promoting the transformation and upgrading of the energy structure. Nonetheless, the performance of energy conversion devices is hindered by the large overpotential and slow kinetics of oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Recently, single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as promising contenders in the field of oxygen electrocatalysis because of their exceptional metal atom utilization, distinctive coordination environment, and adjustable electronic properties. This review presents the latest advancements in the design of Co‐based SACs for oxygen electrocatalysis. First, the OER and ORR mechanisms are introduced. Subsequently, the strategies for regulating the electronic structure of Co‐based SACs are summarized in three aspects, including coordination environment, metal centers, and support carriers. A particular emphasis is given to the relationship between the structure and properties of catalysts. Afterward, the latest applications of Co‐based SACs in energy conversion devices are explored. Ultimately, the challenges and prospects for Co‐based SACs are prospected.

Abstract Wide‐bandgap spinel oxides, such as ZnAl 2 O 4 (ZAO) and ZnCr 2 O 4 (ZCO), are traditionally limited by poor electron activation under light irradiation, resulting in suboptimal photocatalytic performance. This study investigates a novel approach to overcoming these limitations by leveraging the flexoelectric effect in centrosymmetric porous nanoparticles with wrinkled surfaces. The inhomogeneous strain gradients generated under mechanical force induce flexoelectric polarization, offering a promising pathway to enhance photocatalytic activity. ZAO outperforms ZCO due to the smaller atomic radius of aluminum, allowing greater atomic displacement and higher polarization, which prolongs electron‐hole recombination. Oxygen vacancies (O V ) further enhance ZAO performance, with ZAO‐200 (annealed at 200 °C) achieving the longest carrier lifetime (4.65 ns) and an exceptional hydrogen evolution rate of 3737 µmol g −1 h −1 —206% higher than pristine ZAO—without light stimulation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm a lower hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) energy barrier for ZAO (ΔG H = −0.13 eV) compared to ZCO (1.34 eV) and reveal spontaneous water splitting at O V sites without energy input. A unique butterfly curve validates flexoelectric potential generation from strain gradients. These findings establish a novel framework for eco‐friendly hydrogen production, demonstrating that flexoelectric polarization and O V engineering can surpass traditional photocatalytic methods in sustainability and efficiency.

Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) show promise because of their efficient use of precious metals, unique coordination and electronic structures, and excellent tunability. Photocatalysis can harvest solar energy to drive energetically unfavorable reactions under mild conditions, offering a sustainable alternative to energy‐intensive reactions. However, the efficiency of solar photocatalysis is limited by poor solar spectrum utilization and rapid charge recombination. Integrating single atoms into semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising route to address these limitations. Mechanistic understanding of single‐atom photocatalysis is crucial for developing efficient catalysts as they guide effective material design. This work provides an overview of the current knowledge on platinum group SACs applied to photocatalytic applications with a focus on the role of single atoms in photocatalytic reactions. The review begins with a summary of the unique advantages of platinum group metal SACs as well as their common structures. A concise summary of synthesis methods is then provided, followed by a comprehensive review of characterization methods for SAC structure, photoelectronic properties, and mechanisms of action. Next, the role of single atoms in improving general photocatalytic processes as well as specific reactions are discussed. Finally, future outlooks for SAC development are included to guide further advancements in the field.

The aim of this study is to investigate the activity and stability of carbon aerogel‐supported platinum electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, compared to current solutions based on carbon black. Self‐synthesized carbon aerogels (pyrolyzed cellulose, and chitosan‐based aerogels) with multiscale porosity and high overall specific surface area (up to ≈2500 m 2 g −1 ), as well as Vulcan XC‐72R supports were loaded via supercritical deposition (SCD) with platinum nanoparticles (mean particle diameter ≈1.3–2.0 nm, 2.8–3.8 wt% Pt loading). Overpotentials ranged from 46.5 to 50.0 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , whereas self‐synthesized electrocatalysts had similar overpotentials as compared to a commercial catalyst with ≈8–10 times higher Pt loading. In addition, Pt‐carbon aerogel electrocatalysts had higher stability and durability as compared to Pt‐Vulcan, most probably due to the high micro‐ to mesoporosity of carbon aerogels, which promotes nanoparticle stability. The current density at 40 mV for Pt‐Vulcan decreased by 80% after 20 h, whereas an insignificant drop was observed for Pt‐carbon aerogels. These results show that the applied combination of materials (biopolymer‐based carbon aerogels) and loading method (SCD) are a promising approach for synthesizing stable electrocatalysts with reduced platinum content for green hydrogen production.

Abstract Core‐shell nanoparticles are an important class of catalytic materials due to the presence of unsaturated bonds, phase‐separated metals, and synergistic effect of more than one elements. Exploring the electronic properties such as the ‐band center () and the related catalytic properties of these materials are quite challenging due to resource consuming experiments and computationally expensive modeling of the nanoparticles. Therefore, a density functional theory (DFT) coupled recommendation system based approach is developed to predict the of the core‐shell nanoparticles. Here, the recommendation system involves completion of a core‐shell interaction matrix, where each matrix element represents the of a unique core‐shell pair. Matrix completion by predicting the interaction matrix elements is carried out using neural network. The neural network generated a low dimensional representations for each core and shell metals, which are learned iteratively to predict corresponding of the pair. The learned representations brilliantly captures the similarities and dissimilarities between metals present in shell or core. A very low train/test RMSE of 0.009/0.009 is obtained with elemental features based model. The same model is further employed to predict the ‐band width (), suggesting its transferability. This approach recommends the optimum range of / along with the combination of core‐shell metals having most efficient adsorption of species for any reaction. The results presented in this study can help experimentally design the core‐shell nanoparticles having a desired catalytic activity.

We propose a mechanism for generating single photons in the mid-infrared (MIR) using a solid-state or molecular quantum emitter. The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.

Polyimide-based dielectric materials, as excellent high-temperature-resistant polymers, play a crucial role in advanced electronic devices and power systems. However, given the limitations of composite PI materials, it is a significant challenge to simultaneously improve the dielectric constant and breakdown strength of intrinsic polyimide dielectric materials to achieve high energy density. In this study, an indiscriminate copolymerization method was proposed, which utilizes two different diamine monomers with bulky side groups (-CF3) and high polarity (C-O-C), respectively, to copolymerize with the same dianhydride monomer and prepare a series of intrinsic PI films. Remarkably, PI films with a highly dipolar rigid backbone maintain excellent thermal and mechanical properties while enhancing dipole polarization. Meanwhile, a high breakdown strength of PI is shown, because the bulky side groups act as deep traps to capture and disperse charges during the charge transfer process. Under the optimal copolymer ratio, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss are 4.2 and 0.008, respectively. At room temperature, the highest breakdown strength reaches 493MV/m, and the energy storage density and charge–discharge efficiency are 5.07 J/cm3 and 82%, respectively. Finally, based on density functional theory calculations, the copolymerization tendencies of the three monomers are verified, and it is speculated that the copolymerization ratio of PI-60% is the most stable and exhibits the best overall performance, which perfectly aligns with the experimental results. These experimental results demonstrate the exciting potential of intrinsic polyimide in thin film capacitors.

Anion‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) holds immense promise for hydrogen (H 2 ) production yet faces challenges due to the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Highly efficient and durable catalysts for HER are crucial for the successful implementation of AEMWE to produce hydrogen gas reliably. Ruthenium phosphides (Ru x P) have emerged as promising non‐Pt catalysts for alkaline HER; however, they suffer from rapid degradation due to weak RuP bonding, which cannot protect the Ru center from further oxidation and subsequent dissolution. Herein, first‐principles calculations indicate the enhanced stability of RuSe against oxidation compared to RuP, highlighting the importance of introducing Se into the Ru 2 P phase. Electrochemical studies using the selenium (Se)‐doped Ru 2 P double‐walled nanotubes (Ru 2 (P 0.9 Se 0.1 ) DWNTs) demonstrate significantly lower overpotentials (29 mV @ 10 mA cm −2 ) and robust stability (>50 h) in 1.0 m KOH, surpassing those of Pt/C. In AEMWE, Ru 2 (P 0.9 Se 0.1 ) DWNTs exhibit an outstanding performance (10.31 A cm −2 @ 80 °C, stable @ 1.0 A cm −2 for ≈200 h), surpassing state‐of‐the‐art catalysts. The findings of this study highlight the pivotal role of anion modification in enhancing the catalytic stability and performance for efficient hydrogen production in AEMWE systems.

Abstract Tuning transition metal spin states potentially offers a powerful means to control electrocatalyst activity. However, implementing such a strategy in electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) is challenging since rational design rules have yet to be elucidated. Here we show how the addition of P dopants to a ferromagnetic element (Fe, Co, and Ni) single‐atom catalyst (SAC) can shift its spin state. For instance, with Fe SAC, P dopants enable a switch from low spin state ( d x2‐ y2 0 , d z2 0 , d xz 2 , d yz 1 , d xy 2 ) in Fe‐N 4 to high spin state ( d x2‐y2 0 , d xz 1 , d yz 1 , d z2 1 , d xy 2 ) in Fe‐N 3 ‐P. This is studied using a suite of characterization efforts, including X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. When used for CO 2 R, the SAC with Fe‐N 3 ‐P active sites yields > 90% Faradaic efficiency to CO over a wide potential window of ≈530 mV and a maximum CO partial current density of ≈600 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory calculations reveal that high spin state Fe 3+ exhibits enhanced electron back donation via the d xz / d yz ‐π* bond, which enhances * COOH adsorption and promotes CO formation. Taken together, the results show how the SAC spin state can be intentionally tuned to boost CO 2 R performance.

Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution in acidic media at industrial-level current densities is limited by high overpotential, performance degradation, and thus low throughput. To address these issues, we developed a novel nanoedge-enriched molybdenum oxycarbide (MoOxCy) electrocatalysts with a uniform phase by non-equilibrium plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The vertically standing MoOxCy exhibits low overpotential of 415 mV and outstanding long-term operational stability (~ 0.11% performance degradation over 1,000 h) at high current densities up to 10 A cm− 2, corresponding to an ultrahigh hydrogen throughput of 4,477.4 L cm− 2 and a lifetime throughput of 407,033 L cm− 2 which exceed the department of energy (DOE) targets of 1,253.7 L cm− 2 and 100,503 L cm− 2, respectively. Molybdenum oxycarbide catalysts outperform state-of-the-art transition metal- and even noble metal-based catalysts (throughput of 9 ~ 269 L cm− 2 and lifetime throughput of 8 ~ 269 L cm− 2) by more than an order of magnitude for throughput and three orders of magnitude for lifetime throughput. The key mechanisms enabling high catalytic performance and stability are achieved by incorporating carbon into MoO2 lattices, which reduces the valence state of Mo, leading to weakened binding energy of Mo-H and thus improved hydrogen evolution performance. Density functional theory results suggest that the presence of carbon atoms in MoOxCy increases the binding energy between Mo and the adjacent atoms, improving the stability of MoOxCy operating under harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the development of new transition metal-based catalysts for practical industrial electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

The development of efficient and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable energy conversion. Although platinum (Pt) serves as a benchmark HER catalyst, its practical application is hindered by the high cost, limited durability, and susceptibility to CO poisoning. In this work, we report a heterojunction Pt-based catalyst, Pt@NCL-MXene, synthesized by LiF etching of MXene and subsequent NH3 calcination. This process introduces dual nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) doping and yields a nitrogen-doped carbon layer (NCL) coating on Pt nanoparticles with an average size of only 3.4 nm. Compared with conventional Pt–C catalysts, Pt@NCL-MXene exhibits a larger specific surface area, enhanced electron transfer efficiency, and an optimized d-band center, thereby facilitating both H* adsorption and desorption. As a result, Pt@NCL-MXene achieves a significantly lower overpotential of 73 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm–2, alongside improved kinetics and stability under operational conditions. Furthermore, the 9 wt % F-rich MXene support effectively suppresses CO adsorption on Pt, reducing the CO uptake to 0.224 mmol g–1, which is purportedly lower than that of Pt–C (0.264 mmol g–1), thereby mitigating CO poisoning and prolonging the catalyst's service life. These findings offer insights into the rational design of advanced CO-resistant Pt-based HER electrocatalysts.

The electrochemical synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules from biomass-derived compounds under ambient conditions is demonstrated, relying only on green sources of feedstock, renewable energy, and water. In this study, we report a two-step method of electrochemically synthesizing 5-(aminomethyl)furan-2-carboxylic acid (AFCA) from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as the nitrogen source in an acidic electrolyte. In the first step, HMF was reductively aminated into (5-(aminomethyl)furan-2-yl)methanol (HMFA) using NH2OH as the source of nitrogen. This was followed by a second step, involving the oxidation of HMFA to AFCA on a manganese oxide (MnOx) anode at the same pH. MnOx was able to selectively oxidize the alcohol group on HMFA to produce AFCA with 35% Faradaic efficiency without affecting the amine group. As both of these reactions are completed in a pH 1 electrolyte, it eliminates the need to separate HMFA before proceeding with the second reaction. Among different metal electrodes (Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, Pt and Sn) tested for the electrochemical reductive amination reaction, Ag electrodes displayed the best performance to selectively aminate HMF to the intermediate species, HMFA, with up to 69% Faradaic efficiency at mild potentials of −0.50 VRHE. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to explore a possible reaction pathway for the reductive amination on Ag(111), which suggests a thermodynamically feasible reaction even at 0 VRHE. The cathodic experimental reaction parameters were optimized to reveal that an electrolyte pH of 1 is optimal for the electrochemical reductive amination reaction. Our work shapes the future possibility of an electrochemical synthesis to produce AFCA without the need for any product separation between steps by combining the Ag cathode reaction to the MnOx anode reaction sharing the same electrolyte. Since both the cathode and anode reactions both involve four electrons transferred, combining both half reactions in a single electrochemical reactor can eliminate the need for energy-wasting auxiliary counter reactions such as hydrogen evolution or water oxidation.
