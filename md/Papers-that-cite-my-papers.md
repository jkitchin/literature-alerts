Abstract. When simulating new particle formation rates, collisions in the system are approximated as hard spheres without long-range interactions. This simplification may lead to an underestimation of the actual formation rate. In this study, we employ semi-empirical molecular dynamics (SEMD) at the GFN1-xTB level of theory to probe the sticking process of the monomers sulfuric acid (SA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), nitric acid (NA), formic acid (FA), ammonia (AM), methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), and trimethylamine (TMA) onto freshly nucleated particles (FNPs). The FNPs considered are (SA)10(AM)10, (SA)10(MA)10, (SA)10(DMA)10, and (SA)10(TMA)10. In general, we find that the hard-sphere kinetic approximation, which neglects long-range interactions, significantly underestimates the number of collisions leading to sticking. By calculating the sticking coefficient from SEMD simulations, we obtain enhancement factors of 2.3 and 1.5 for the SA + (SA)10(AM)10 and AM + (SA)10(AM)10 collisions, respectively. A comparison with OPLS (optimized potentials for liquid simulations) all-atom force field simulations shows similar enhancement factors of 2.4 and 1.6 for the SA + (SA)10(AM)10 and AM + (SA)10(AM)10 collisions, respectively. Compared to the force field simulations, SEMD exhibits a more isotropic sticking behavior, with the probability remaining near unity for small offsets before rapidly dropping to 0 % beyond a certain offset. In contrast, the force field simulations show a more gradual decline in sticking probability due to certain orientations still leading to sticking. The largest discrepancy between the two methods occurs at lower collision velocities – below 200 m s−1 for SA and below 400 m s−1 for AM – where force field simulations, even for head-on collisions, predict low or zero sticking probability. This has previously been attributed to periodic repulsions between the rotating collision partners caused by fluctuations in their charge distributions. In contrast, SEMD simulations do not exhibit this behavior. Since these low velocities are not significantly populated in our simulations, both methods yield similar enhancement factors. However, for systems with larger effective masses, where such velocities are more prevalent, we would expect the two methods to diverge.

Abstract The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for energy conversion technologies like fuel cells and metal–air batteries. However, advancing efficient and stable ORR catalysts remains a significant challenge. Iron‐based single‐atom catalysts (Fe SACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to precious metals. However, their catalytic performance and stability remain constrained. Introducing a second metal (M) to construct Fe─M dual‐atom catalysts (Fe─M DACs) is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of Fe SACs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in Fe‐based DACs for ORR. It begins by examining the structural advantages of Fe─M DACs from the perspectives of electronic structure and reaction pathways. Next, the precise synthetic strategies for DACs are discussed, and the structure–performance relationships are explored, highlighting the role of the second metal in improving catalytic activity and stability.

The cobalt crystalline islands (Cocryst) were electrochemically deposited onto a glassy carbon (GC) support and then modified by a facile spontaneous deposition of platinum. The electrocatalytic activity of the resulting Cocryst-Pt core-shell catalyst was evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline medium. The XRD characterization of the Cocryst-Pt islands revealed that the cobalt core had a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystalline structure, and that the platinum shell exhibited a crystalline structure with a preferential (111) orientation. SEM images showed that the average lateral size of the Cocryst islands was 1.17 μm, which increased to 1.32 μm after adding platinum. The XPS analysis indicated that the outer layer of the bulk metallic Cocryst islands was fully oxidized. During the spontaneous deposition of platinum, the outer Co(OH)2 layer was dissolved, leaving the cobalt core in a metallic state, while the platinum shell remained only partially oxidized. The high electrochemically active surface area of the Cocryst-Pt/GC electrode, along with a suitable crystalline structure of the Cocryst-Pt islands, contributes to enhancing its ORR activity by providing a greater number of surface active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent reduction. The ORR on the Cocryst-Pt catalyst occurs via a four-electron reaction pathway, with onset and half-wave potentials of 1.07 V and 0.87 V, respectively, which exceed those of polycrystalline platinum and a commercial benchmark Pt/C.

Abstract The electrocatalytic two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) presents an environmentally sustainable approach to produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Heterostructures coupling non‐noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) with carbon materials hold promise for 2e − ORR, but face challenges in controlling morphology, phase composition, and active centers. In this study, a hierarchically porous tremella‐like heterojunction characterized by ultrafine cubic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles within the amorphous carbon (UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC) is obtained using the integrated platform of green Fe‐based deep eutectic solvent via a two‐step annealing process. UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC exhibits remarkable overall and intrinsic 2e − ORR activity, delivering 96% H 2 O 2 selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 67.5 s −1 . Notably, UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC possesses superior H 2 O 2 production capabilities, showing long‐term stability of 100 h with a H 2 O 2 production rate of 8.1 g L −1 h −1 in flow‐cell, while achieving various medical‐grade H 2 O 2 concentrations (3.0–7.8 wt%). Additionally, integrating on‐site H 2 O 2 production with electro‐Fenton achieved rapid decomposition of contaminants. The unique heterostructure, with the synergistic effect of Fe 3 O 4 and amorphous carbon, enhances electronic conductivity. Moreover, the electronic redistribution at the interface of the heterostructure triggers the thermodynamically favorable multiple active sites of Fe and C centers for the 2e − ORR. This work offers a new perspective on transition metal‐based materials for H 2 O 2 production.

Abstract Nano‐heterointerface serves as a catalytic center for water dissociation promoted by the concerted interaction of *OH on oxide and *H on nitride. Kinetic energetics of water dissociation and hydroxyl (de)stabilization are vital to surface coverage of reactive *H and surface charge for *OH reductive desorption. electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of DMPO‐H and DMPO‐OH unravel radical nature of water‐dissociated *H and *OH. coherent synergism of interfacial ensemble and electronic effects realizes TOF/η−ɛ d volcano as the net result of work‐function‐directed competition between interfacial water dissociation (covalent control) and *OH reductive desorption (ionic control) kinetics, manifesting that alkaline HER volcano shaped by d‐band descriptor originates from intricate balance guided by work function descriptor. Orchestrated with alkali metal cations on fine‐tuning covalent/ionic interaction between catalyst surface and water‐derived intermediates, microrod‐array N–MoCoNiAl/NF electrode (NF═Ni foam) drives 10 mA cm −2 at overpotential of 10 mV in 1 m KOH. The proposed pathway may provide insight into how the peculiar electronic structure of multi‐site heterojunction and the interfacial hard‐soft covalent/electrostatic interactions impact molecular‐level mechanism for efficient Volmer kinetics.

Abstract Ferroelectric materials exhibit inherent polarization characteristics that render them viable options for improving photocatalytic performance via efficient charge carrier separation. Nonetheless, the majority of two dimensional (2D) materials exhibit an absence of ferroelectric properties owing to their elevated symmetry, which presents obstacles for their utilization in photocatalysis. This study presents two novel strategies for inducing ferroelectricity in 2D materials: intralayer polarization, accomplished by substituting phosphorus atoms in black phosphorus (BP) with elements like nitrogen (N), arsenic (As), or antimony (Sb); and interlayer polarization, realized through a controlled heterostructure design. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that these tailored materials demonstrate markedly diminished overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), with values as low as 1.04 and 1.12 eV, respectively. The materials exhibit competitive Gibbs free energy profiles for the hydrogen evolution process (HER), highlighting their adaptability. The findings provide a framework for utilizing intralayer and interlayer engineering to improve the ferroelectric characteristics of 2D materials, facilitating advanced applications in photocatalysis and renewable energy conversion.

In view of climate change, seawater desalination is of concern to mankind, as the most difficult step in water treatment is the isolation of NaCl from seawater. The methods currently used to disable seawater remain costly, so it is important to understand and improve other methods for reducing the cost of seawater filtration. An atomic-scale computational study of NaCl and H2O adsorption on graphite and graphene is presented, with the aim of estimating the ability of graphite-graphene to remove NaCl from seawater to obtain drinking water. The calculations are based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), using the Grid-based Projector-Augmented Wave (GPAW) approach, Atomistic Simulation Environment (ASE), and Quantum ESPRESSO methods. The main results of our work are the optimization of H2O and NaCl molecule energies and densities of molecular states, and the calculation of the optimal adsorption distance of these molecules on the adsorbent (graphite-graphene). The observed changes in adsorption energies and density of states of the adsorbent could be exploited in the perspective of seawater filter applications. Our results could contribute to the optimization of potential seawater filter applications. The present work provides interesting information to the theoretical and experimental communities working in this field of research. It opens up the debate on the adsorption of H2O and NaCl molecules on graphite and graphene.

Halogen elements, as common nonmetal dopants, have attracted significant attention for their potential in creating highly active photocatalysts. To improve the electronic property of BiVO4, a highly promising photoanode nanomaterial for solar water splitting, the halogen atom (Cl, Br, and I) doping strategy and underlying modification mechanisms were explored in detail by the first-principles calculations here. Formation energies confirmed that halogen doping at the O sites of BiVO4 is energetically favorable and can be realized experimentally. The conduction band minimum (CBM) energy level is stabilized and even shifted into the occupied electron states, while the valence band maximum (VBM) energy level is increased for BiVO4 upon halogen atom doping with a trend: I > Br > Cl. Furthermore, the n-type electron-donating behavior becomes increasingly significant with higher dopant mass concentrations, which is attributed to the lower electronegativity of introduced halogen atoms compared to that of the substituted O atoms. Moreover, doping with Cl, Br, or I atoms induces strong spin polarization and effectively suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in BiVO4. Furthermore, H2O adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) results for each fundamental stage confirmed that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process is favored by such an n-type doping method. All of these results proved that halogen atom (Cl, Br, and I) doping is a reliable strategy to improve photoelectrical properties, consequently boosting the photocatalytic performance of BiVO4 through modifications to its electronic structure.

Abstract High‐entropy‐alloy (HEA) nanocrystals, characterized by multicomponent solid solutions and synergistic effects, hold great potential in catalysis. However, synthesizing HEA hollow nanocrystals with 3D architectures and controlled surface atomic arrangements to enhance catalytic activity and durability remains challenging. Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are presented, derived from Pd@HEA core‐shell nanocrystals featuring a few HEA atomic layers containing five platinum‐group metals, synthesized via a Fe(III)‐based wet etching strategy. The controlled etching process transformed Pd@HEA core‐shell nanocubes enclosed by {100} facets into Pd@HEA porous nanocubes, HEA cubic nanocages, and eventually, HEA cubic nanoframes composed of subnanometer‐thick ridges dominated by {110} facets, vacancies, and step atoms. Electron microscopy and synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the randomly mixed coordination environments of the constituent elements, underscoring the excellent atomic mixing within the nanoframes. These nanoframes demonstrated a 9.72‐fold higher acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) specific activity at an overpotential of −0.1 V than commercial Pt/C catalysts, remarkable durability after 15 000 potential cycles, and competitive performance as cathode catalysts for practical applications in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Density functional theory calculations attributed the superior HER performance to {110}‐enclosed atomically mixed surfaces and low‐coordination sites, optimizing hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG H* ) near the ideal value of 0.

Abstract Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) represent a transformative technology for sustainable hydrogen production and power generation by converting energy between chemical and electrical forms. Operating at intermediate temperatures, PCECs utilize proton‐conducting electrolytes, achieving high efficiency and reduced degradation. However, a major bottleneck lies at the oxygen electrode due to sluggish kinetics and limited active sites. To address this, we present a hybrid oxygen electrode featuring PrNi 0.7 Co 0.3 O 3–δ (PNC) backbone infused with oxygen vacancy‐rich praseodymium oxide (PrO x ) nanoparticles. This design leverages the interplay between surface and bulk properties to enhance oxygen adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic kinetics. The PrO x introduces abundant oxygen vacancies and modulates the d ‐band center for optimal adsorption energy, while the PNC backbone provides robust proton conduction and stabilizes reaction intermediates. Cells incorporating this hybrid electrode demonstrate a peak power density of 1.56 W cm −2 at 600 °C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.25 A cm −2 at 1.30 V in electrolysis mode. Faradaic and energy efficiency reach 96.8% and 89.9%, respectively, with exceptional thermal cycling stability and reduced polarization resistance (0.079 Ω cm 2 ). This study underscores the potential of advanced electrode architectures to enhance the efficiency, durability, and applicability of PCECs in renewable energy systems.

In the quest to enhance the safety of lithium-ion batteries, substantial research is underway to develop all-solid-state batteries, facing challenges in achieving high ion conductivity in solid electrolytes. This study aims to enhance the ion conductivity by incorporating carbon-doped graphitic carbon nitride (C-doped g-C3N4) microspheres as an inorganic filler into the poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). Leveraging the advantageous properties of g-C3N4 as an effective inorganic filler by enhancing its Lewis acid-base interactions with lithium, we modified g-C3N4 through carbon doping to improve the ionic conductivity of the SPE. Our experimental analysis supports the increased lithium transference number after hybridizing electrolytes with C-doped g-C3N4, signifying heightened ion mobility resulting from carbon substitution on g-C3N4. Subsequent density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal increased lithium binding energy due to the carbon doping of g-C3N4, thereby ultimately enhancing the ion conductivity by promoting salt dissociation. Optimizing carbon doping levels and hybrid electrolyte composition yields improved ion conductivity and electrochemical performance, with optimal outcomes observed at 7% C-doped g-C3N4 with SPE. Evaluation in a pouch cell with the NCM811 cathode underscores the applicability of the hybrid electrolyte on a large scale, showcasing promising advancements in battery technology. Our carbon-doped g-C3N4 filler demonstrates promising potential in advancing ion conductivity through enhanced salt dissociations.

Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) holds great potential as a sustainable strategy for green hydrogen production. However, it still faces significant challenges due to the lack of highly efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a synergistic approach by incorporating Ru atoms into MoS2 nanosheets to optimize the structure and conductivity has been proposed, which could improve the HER performance of MoS2 under alkaline conditions. Combining theoretical calculations and structural characterizations, it is demonstrated that the Ru atom introduction leads to the localized distortions of MoS2, generating additional active sites for H* adsorption, and reduces the free energy to adsorb and desorb hydrogen. Furthermore, the Ru introduction makes partial transformation from the 2H phase to the 1T phase in MoS2, which results in the change of the electronic structure and further enhances the electrical conductivity. As a result, the Ru-doped MoS2 electrocatalysts exhibit the high HER activities with the low overpotentials of 61 mV and 79 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH and alkaline seawater, respectively. This work provides a novel design strategy for enhancing HER activity through the synergistic modulation of structural and electronic properties, offering valuable insights for the development of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.

Developing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting remains a pivotal challenge for sustainable energy. In this work, we present a bulk nanoporous C15 intermetallic alloy synthesized through electrodealloying of a eutectic multiprincipal element precursor. Unlike conventional metallic nanostructures, this catalyst features an ultrathin multiprincipal element oxide (MPEO) layer, which generates abundant active sites and achieves exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, surpassing most reported catalysts. Crucially, the material demonstrates unprecedented stability at industrial-level current densities (1 A/cm2 at 396 mV), enabled by operando amorphization of the MPEO layer during prolonged operation. This structural evolution stabilizes the catalyst-electrolyte interface while retaining intrinsic activity. Our findings redefine design principles for robust, high-performance electrocatalysts by integrating bulk intermetallic architectures with self-optimizing surface chemistry.

Proton transfer plays a crucial role in various chemical and biological processes, yet accurately and efficiently describing such reactions remains challenging due to nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). In this work, we employ constrained nuclear-electronic orbital molecular dynamics (CNEO-MD), a method that inherently incorporates NQEs into classical dynamics to investigate double proton transfer in the formic acid dimer (FAD). Leveraging machine learning techniques, we efficiently construct free energy landscapes with NQEs at finite temperatures and obtain transition state theory (TST) rates. Transmission coefficients are further evaluated using flux-side correlation functions to obtain corrected rates that account for recrossing effects. CNEO-MD predicts significantly lowered free energy barriers and enhanced rates compared to conventional DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), agreeing qualitatively with previous path-integral simulations. Additionally, we explore solvent effects using CNEO-MD with a dielectric continuum solvent model and find the change of the solvent model makes negligible effects. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CNEO-MD in describing proton transfer reactions at finite temperatures and highlight its potential for applications in more complex systems.

Metalloporphyrins, owing to their structural resemblance to natural enzyme active sites and highly tunable coordination environments, have emerged as promising catalysts for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. Considerable efforts have been made to modify metalloporphyrins to improve their catalytic capability for CO2 reduction. One approach involves modifying the metal coordination environment (known as the first coordination sphere) to generate heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins, particularly N-confused and O/S-substituted variants. While heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins were first synthesized in 1989, their use in CO2 reduction catalysis was not reported until after 2020. Herein, we review the recent progress in the design, catalytic performance, and mechanistic studies of N-confused and O/S-substituted metalloporphyrins towards CO2 reduction. This review encompasses both experimental and theoretical computational work, as well as the use of porphyrins as catalysts in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, based on the current research advances, we present critical recommendations and future research directions, with a focus on theoretical studies, in the hope of facilitating the rational design of novel catalysts for sustainable energy conversion and environmental remediation.

Metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C, M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pt) dual-atom catalysts (DACs) show great potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). During catalytic reactions, multiple reactants and intermediates interact with the active sites, yet understanding their dynamic structural evolution under the operating conditions remains challenging. In this study, we analyze 186 heteronuclear FeM-N-C DACs using ab initio thermodynamic phase diagrams and find that OH-ligated structures become predominant at higher applied potentials. This indicates that catalytic activity is governed by electrochemically modified metal sites rather than by the bare structures. We further investigate the catalytic mechanism of these ligated structures and reveal that the ORR limiting potential can be efficiently predicted from the phase diagrams. Among the 186 DACs studied, 29 were found to outperform Pt-based catalysts, with FeCo-N-C DACs demonstrating the highest activity. Our computational predictions align well with experimental observations, highlighting the crucial role of dynamic structural changes under reaction conditions in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of DACs.

The development of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with site-specific and tunable catalytic functionalities remains a highly desirable yet challenging goal in catalysis. In this study, we report a SAC featuring anisotropic coordination cavities synthesized via a one-step polymerization of 2,6-diaminopyridine and cyanuric chloride. These cavities provide a robust framework for anchoring isolated Pd single atoms with exceptional stability. The unique broken symmetry of the catalyst's local structure enables precise control over reaction pathways, allowing reactivity to be switched between distinct catalytic outcomes. Specifically, under tailored reaction conditions, the catalyst can either halt at the borylation step or proceed seamlessly to Suzuki coupling in a self-cascade process. Mechanistic studies unveil the pivotal role of Pd single atoms in driving key steps, including oxidative addition, base exchange, and reductive elimination. Furthermore, green metrics demonstrate the process's sustainability, with minimized waste generation and reduced reliance on hazardous reagents in the self-cascade transformation. This work establishes an innovative benchmark in the field of single-atom catalysis: by enabling complex, multistep transformations via strategic activation of multiple functional groups, this catalyst exemplifies the potential of self-cascade processes to revolutionize synthetic chemistry via catalysis engineering.

High-valent iron oxido species, central to many enzymatic and biomimetic catalyzed organic oxidative transformations, can be generated by direct electrochemical oxidation, circumventing high-energy O atom donor reagents. Electrochemical generation necessitates knowledge of the redox potentials involved, which is hindered by the lack of well-defined Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox waves in the voltammetry of many iron-based catalysts. Hence, other approaches including chemical oxidation and bulk spectro(electro)chemical methods need to be taken. In the case of the well-studied oxidation catalyst, [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+, where N4Py is 1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine, estimates of the Fe(III/IV) redox potentials range from 0.4 to 1.3 V vs SCE. Here, we show that electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy reveals "hidden" redox waves, and hence redox potentials, when coupled with cyclic voltammetry. Rapid spectral acquisition (>2 Hz) of surface-enhanced Raman spectra at electrochemically roughened gold electrodes enables real-time spectral acquisition during cyclic voltammetry. We show that the Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox potential of [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+ is close to that determined earlier by chemical redox titrations (0.85 V vs SCE). Furthermore, comproportionation and adsorption processes are shown to impact the rates of electron transfer observed, which rationalizes the absence of a distinct Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox wave in its cyclic voltammetry.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a versatile and environmentally friendly oxidant with broad applications in industry, energy, and environmental remediation. Electrocatalytic H2O2 production via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) has emerged as a sustainable alternative to traditional anthraquinone processes. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a class of crystalline porous materials, exhibit high structural tunability, large surface areas, and chemical stability, making them promising electrocatalysts for 2e− ORR. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in COF-based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production, including both metal-free and metal-containing systems. We discuss key strategies in COF design—such as dimensional modulation, linkage engineering, heteroatom doping, and post-synthetic modification—and highlight their effects on activity, selectivity, and stability. Fundamental insights into the 2e− ORR mechanism and evaluation metrics are also provided. Finally, we offer perspectives on current challenges and future directions, emphasizing the integration of machine learning, conductivity enhancement, and scalable synthesis to advance COFs toward practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.
