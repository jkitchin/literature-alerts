Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its high gravimetric hydrogen capacity as well as the abundance and low cost of magnesium. The material's limiting factor is the high dehydrogenation temperature (over 300 °C) and sluggish (de)hydrogenation kinetics when no catalyst is present, making it impractical for onboard applications. Catalysts and physical restructuring (e.g., through ball milling) have both shown kinetic improvements, without full theoretical understanding as to why. In this work, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) for the Mg–H system, which was used to run long time scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a thick magnesium hydride surface slab for up to 1 ns. Our MLP-based MD simulations reveal previously unreported behavior of subsurface molecular H2 formation and subsequent trapping in the subsurface layer of MgH2. This hindered diffusion of subsurface H2 offers a partial explanation on the slow dehydrogenation kinetics of MgH2. The kinetics will be improved if a catalyst obstructs subsurface formation and trapping of H2 or if the diffusion of subsurface H2 is improved through defects created by physical restructuring.    

    

## Decoding the Role of Adsorbates Entropy in the Reactivity of Single-Atom Catalysts

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile class of materials that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. A growing number of studies aim to identify potential new SACs or to describe their structure and reactivity through ab initio quantum chemical simulations. While many computational studies primarily address reactions involving small molecules, such as water splitting or CO2 reduction, the application scope of SACs is rapidly broadening to include the production of fine chemicals and the conversion of biomass-derived platform molecules, processes that involve larger, more complex reactants. Using density-functional theory (DFT) simulations, we demonstrate that, while an approximate treatment of entropy is acceptable for molecules with up to three atoms, it introduces substantial errors in reactions involving more complex molecules. Our results reveal a linear correlation between the entropy of adsorbed molecules and that of the corresponding isolated species, mirroring trends observed on extended catalytic surfaces. For the largest systems investigated in this study, the entropy of the free molecule is reduced by approximately 10–20% upon adsorption; for small molecules, this reduction can range from 50 to 70%. This disparity arises because, on SACs, the translational entropy is effectively zero, the rotational entropy is minimal, and the vibrational entropy increases with the size of the molecule. Moreover, the entropy of adsorbates scales linearly with the number of atoms in the molecule, allowing for the prediction of entropic contributions of adsorbates on SACs without additional computational cost. Using propyne hydrogenation as a test, we demonstrate that the reaction energy profile computed with current approximate approaches for estimating the entropy of adsorbates differs significantly from the profile where entropy is explicitly included. These findings highlight the importance of considering adsorbate entropy for accurately predicting the catalytic activity of SACs, particularly for reactions involving complex molecules.    

    

## Controlling Co 3d/O 2p Orbital Hybridization in LaCoO3 by Modulating the Co–O–Co Bond Angle for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysis

The orbital hybridization between metal and oxygen of perovskite catalysts can lower the overpotential and enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. This study combines density functional theory with experiments to clarify how Sr/Fe codoping modulates orbital hybridization and enhances OER catalytic activity of LaCoO3. The as-prepared La0.50Sr0.50Co0.75Fe0.25O3 shows remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm–2 current density and a 107.03 mV dec–1 Tafel slope, outperforming most state-of-the-art perovskite-based OER electrocatalysts. The experimental results confirm that Sr/Fe codoping enhances the expansion of Co–O–Co bond angles and strengthens the covalency of the Co–O bond in LaCoO3, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, increasing Sr doping reduces the distance between the Co 3d/O 2p center and the Fermi level, decreasing the energy difference between them and enhancing the degree of orbital hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p. As the degree of Co 3d/O 2p orbital hybridization increases, a higher charge transfer was found between the active center and intermediate product, OOH, reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step while lowering the overpotential. This study provides thorough insight into the rational design of OER catalysts based on orbital hybridization.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted the attention of the scientific community due to a number of attractive properties allowing their application in different catalytic processes, including electrochemical ones. Due to the nature of the active site, consisting of only a few atoms, SACs are also very attractive for theoretical modeling as the active site can be directly translated into the computational model. However, as a rule, the possibility of the active site change induced by pH and electrode potential is disregarded in theoretical models. This Perspective emphasizes the need to address the actual state of SA electrocatalysts under operating conditions before considering their catalytic activity and selectivity. The concept of surface Pourbaix plot, well-known in electrochemistry, can be directly transferred to SACs, providing valuable insights and guidance for developing novel catalytic materials. We discuss recent approaches to designing Pourbaix plots for SACs and outline the importance of properly treating the actual state of SACs and other emerging types of catalysts.

Adsorbate free energies are important parameters in surface chemistry and catalysis. Because of its simplicity, the harmonic oscillator (HO) model remains the most widely used method for calculating adsorbate free energy in many fields, including microkinetic modeling. However, it is well-known that the HO method is ineffective for weak adsorption. In this study, we propose a translational model with a diffusion barrier to calculate the state functions of near free translation. Furthermore, an effective mass is introduced in this model. To address hindered translation uniformly, a diffusion barrier-based damping function (DF) is proposed that effectively links the harmonic vibration and translation limits. Adsorbates are divided into three categories according to their adsorption strength and diffusion barrier height. Adsorbed hydrogen atoms have a strong binding energy and relatively high vibrational frequency but a low diffusion barrier. The HT and our proposed DF methods predict that the adsorbed hydrogen atoms behave as translation above room temperature, while the previous DF method predicts that they behave as vibration at any temperature. At last, the dehydrogenation reaction of propane on the Pt(111) surface was taken as an example to illustrate the influence of different methods on the thermodynamic functions.

Abstract High‐entropy‐alloy (HEA) nanocrystals hold immense potential for catalysis, offering virtually unlimited alloy combinations through the inclusion of at least five constituent elements in varying ratios. However, general and effective strategies for synthesizing libraries of HEA nanocrystals with controlled surface atomic structures remain scarce. In this study, a transferable strategy for developing a library of facet‐controlled seed@HEA nanocrystals through seed‐mediated growth is presented. The synthesis of seed@HEA core–shell nanocrystals incorporating up to ten different metallic elements, with control over the number of solid‐solution HEA atomic layers is demonstrated. Epitaxial HEA growth on nanocrystal seeds with low‐index and high‐index facets leads to the formation of seed@HEA catalyst library with composition‐ and facet‐dependent catalytic activities in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In situ synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and density‐functional theory calculations are employed to identify surface active sites of the HEA, rationalizing the high level of catalytic activities achieved. This work enables facet engineering in the multi‐elemental chemical space and unveils the critical needs for their future development toward catalysis.

Hydrogen emerges as a pivotal clean and versatile energy carrier amid global energy challenges, urging a shift towards renewable hydrogen production. The efficiency of the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hinges on catalyst choice, ambient conditions, and electrolyte pH. In transitioning away from costly and scarce catalysts like Pt or Ru, researchers explore Earth-abundant alternatives, notably transition metal-based quantum dots (QDs) and MXenes. QDs offer high surface area and customizable properties, while MXenes demonstrate exceptional conductivity and surface area. QDs, despite challenges such as agglomeration, prove effective when engineered into composites. MXenes, with their unique stacked structure and chemical robustness, hold promise for HER catalysis. As discussed, QDs and MXenes exhibit schematic HER representations, emphasizing their potential as catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production and their adaptability to span diverse fields, offering scalable solutions towards a renewable energy future.

Hydrogen is regarded as a vital resource for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. Electrocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a viable technique for producing ultra-pure hydrogen. The electrocatalyst, which can catalyze the electrochemical process to decrease the overpotential by increasing the current density, is critical to the effectiveness of this approach. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have become recognized as possible electrocatalysts in recent years due to their exposed surface active sites, evenly distributed interconnected pore structure, and adjustable shape. Thus, the significance of homogeneous and heterogeneous MOFs and their derivatives for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution process (HER) is summarized in this chapter. The chapter begins with an overview of the fundamentals of the electrocatalytic HER, after which the importance of various transition metal-based pristine MOFs and their derivatives towards the HER is examined. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement given their sub-par intrinsic activity and weak conductivity. Various MOF-derived composites, as well as new methodologies and procedures, are given to solve intrinsic activity and conductivity issues, emphasizing progress in MOF-based materials for a more effective HER electrocatalyst in large-scale hydrogen production.

Abstract The concentrated alkaline passivates the monolithic electrode for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) industry. Herein, a surface engineering of cathodic protection via one‐step co‐electrodeposition of P into NiCuV is presented and the achieved monolithic electrode exhibits an enhanced electrochemical catalytic behavior and constant durability with a feedback potential of −0.75 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under an extremely high current density of 1A cm −2 for more than 270 h in alkaline media. The strategy of cathodic protection optimises the charge density redistribution by forming a phosphate surface layer. This preserves the particular metal (alloy) phase from oxidation while also modulating the heterarchical porous structure through P incorporation. Furthermore, an anion‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with the NiCuVP serving as the HER catalyst and the NiFeCr LDH as the OER catalyst is constructed, which exhibits a current density of 912 mA cm −2 at 2 V at 80 °C with 30 wt.% KOH electrolytes. The resultant factors for activity and durability such as the electrochemical specific area, redox behaviors and surface hydrophilicity are also systematically discussed. This research presents a practical protocol for the anticorrosion and active enhancement of AWE and AEMWE cathodes.

Proton transfer plays a crucial role in various chemical and biological processes. A major theoretical challenge in simulating proton transfer arises from the quantum nature of the proton. The constrained nuclear-electronic orbital (CNEO) framework was recently developed to efficiently and accurately account for nuclear quantum effects, particularly quantum nuclear delocalization effects, in quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we systematically investigate challenging proton transfer modes in a series of shared-proton systems using CNEO density functional theory (CNEO-DFT), focusing on evaluating existing electron–proton correlation functionals. Our results show that CNEO-DFT accurately describes proton transfer vibrational modes and significantly outperforms conventional DFT. The inclusion of the epc17-2 electron–proton correlation functional in CNEO-DFT produces similar performance to that without electron–proton correlations, while the epc17-1 functional yields less accurate results, comparable with conventional DFT. These findings hold true for both asymmetrical and symmetrical shared-proton systems. Therefore, until a more accurate electron–proton correlation functional is developed, we currently recommend performing vibrational spectrum calculations using CNEO-DFT without electron–proton correlation functionals.    

    

## Modulating the Coordination Environment of Cu-Embedded MoX2 (X = S, Se, and Te) Monolayers for Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CH4: Unveiling the Origin of Catalytic Activity

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to alleviating global warming and emerging energy crises. Yet, the CO2RR efficiency is impeded by the need for electrocatalysts with good selectivity and efficiency. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention in electrocatalysis and are more efficient than traditional metal-based catalysts. In this study, we modeled a Cu single atom embedded on MoX2 (X = Se and Te) monolayer with a single chalcogen (X) vacancy as SAC. Employing the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) method, the electrocatalytic CO2RR activity of the Cu-MoX2 SACs is systematically investigated through significant descriptors, such as the Gibbs free energy change, charge density difference, and COHP analysis. The stability of SACs, CO2 adsorption configurations, and all possible reaction pathways for the formation of C1 products (HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, and CH4) were examined. All of the Cu-MoX2 SACs are stable and show high catalytic selectivity for the CO2RR by significantly suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We found that the catalytic activity is mainly due to the level of antibonding states filling between the Cu atom and *OCHOH intermediate. Among the C1 products, CH4 is selectively produced in all three SACs. Notably, there is a decrease in the limiting potential (UL) when X changes from S to Te in Cu-MoX2. Among these three SACs, Cu-MoTe2 SAC is the most promising catalyst for reducing CO2 to CH4, with as low as UL of −0.34 V vs RHE. Our results demonstrate that the local coordination environment in SACs has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of CO2RR.

From the photoelectric effect to the development of contemporary photocatalysts, the hunt for efficient energy conversion has been a tale of invention and discovery. Since 1972, water-splitting photocatalysis has evolved as an effective strategy for advancing toward sustainable energy. The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, formed by the vertical stacking of two distinct 2D materials, exhibit unique electronic properties. The weak vdW interactions tend to provide the benefit of efficient carrier separation, thus making them promising candidates for photocatalysis. However, analyzing all possible combinations of 2D materials is impractical through traditional approaches, necessitating the development of predictive models to automate and accelerate the quest. Herein, we propose a hybrid approach using machine learning (ML) in conjugation with first-principles calculations to predict the properties of hexagonal vdW bilayers for application in photocatalysis. Our ML workflow comprises the following major steps: (1) constructing a vast material space of bilayers and their descriptors using a 2D material database, (2) labeling a diverse set of bilayers using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, (3) training the supervised ML models on a labeled data set for binding energy, interlayer distance, band gap, work function, and band edges of heterostructures, (4) evaluating the performance of models on the validation set, and (5) predicting the properties of the unlabeled data set and screening the bilayers feasible for overall water-splitting (OWS) photocatalysis. The computational framework presented here tends to establish the relationship between 2D monolayers and vdW bilayers. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach in accelerating the search for novel photocatalysts by efficiently and accurately predicting their properties, thereby contributing to the broader goal of sustainable energy production.

## The Melamine-Driven Solvation Effect Promotes Oxygen Reduction on a Platinum Catalyst: Machine Learning-Aided Free Energy Calculations

The modification of Pt surfaces with organic compounds like melamine enhances oxygen reduction reaction activity and catalyst durability. Through first-principles free energy calculations utilizing thermodynamic integration and finite-temperature molecular dynamics, enhanced by machine learning force fields for efficient sampling of nanosecond-scale interfacial water fluctuations and incorporating corrections to accurately reproduce first-principles free energies, we demonstrate that melamine destabilizes OH adsorbates, facilitating their removal and enhancing catalytic activity. Unlike alloys, where OH destabilization is driven by changes in electronic structure and surface strain, melamine disrupts hydrogen bonding between OH and interfacial water. Structural and vibrational analyses reveal that melamine alters the water solvation structure, which is evident in modified radial distribution functions and a blue shift in the O–H stretching vibrations. These findings indicate that manipulating interfacial solvation with organic compounds could be a promising approach to enhance catalytic activity without compromising durability.

Developing highly efficient non-iridium-based active sites for acidic water splitting is still a huge challenge. Herein, unique Ru–B–Cr moieties have been constructed in RuO2 nanofibers (NFs) to activate Ru sites for water electrolysis, which overcomes the bottleneck of RuO2-based catalysts usually possessing low activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and poor stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated Cr, B-doped RuO2 NFs exhibit low overpotentials of 205 and 379 mV for acidic HER and OER at 1 A cm–2 with outstanding stability lasting 1000 and 188 h, respectively. The assembled acidic electrolyzer also possesses great hydrogen production efficiency and durability at a high current density. Experimental and theoretical explorations reveal that the formation of Ru–B–Cr moieties effectively optimizes the atomic configurations and modulates the adsorption/desorption free energy of reaction intermediates to achieve exceptional HER and OER performance.

The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3–RR) involves multiple hydrogenation and deoxygenation steps, which compete with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Therefore, NO3–RR driven in acidic media is challenging in spite of advantageous fast hydrogen transfers in its elementary steps. The findings presented in this article first demonstrate that the NO3–RR is significantly activated even in acidic lithium nitrate solutions at LiNO3 concentrations exceeding 6 m on a Pt electrode (the highly effective catalyst for HER) by the formation of a "hydronium-in-salt" electrolyte (HISE), a new type of aqueous high concentration salt electrolyte. The observed enhancement of NO3–RR while the suppression of HER-activity in the LiNO3 based HISE was verified by scanning electrochemical microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, UV–vis/IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. The formation of a HISE in acidic LiNO3 solutions contrasts with that of a "water-in-salt" electrolyte in LiTFSI with the same concentration. The mechanism of NO3–RR activation in a HISE suggests facilitated proton-coupled electron transfers (PCETs) from H3O+ to NO3– and subsequent reactive intermediates owing to the proximity between the two ions induced by the unique solvation structure blended with all ions together (Li+ + NO3– + H3O+). In contrast, all the ions are separately hydrated at low concentrations of LiNO3 electrolytes. On the other hand, PCET from H2O to NO3– in a high concentration LiNO3 electrolyte (e.g., 9 m) is not kinetically preferred, probably owing to the slow dissociation kinetics of H2O, and therefore, H2O reduction is not suppressed by the NO3–RR.
