Electrochemical hydrogen purification (EHP) technology with high-efficiency and easy-operation holds great potential in blended hydrogen transportation, which is currently restricted to proton exchange membrane system and Pt-based catalysts. As promising candidates used in alkaline anion exchange membrane system, Pd-based catalysts are hampered by the intense interaction between H* and delocalized 4d electrons, resulting in unsatisfactory catalytic activity. In this study, a marked enhancement of the alkaline membrane-based EHP performance is achieved, with hydrogen purity up to 99.96% separated from a CH4-H2 mixture, by strategically incorporating interstitial H atoms into Pd lattices for improving the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction. Detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations elucidate that the presence of interstitial H localizes free electrons into Pd-H covalent bonds, thereby weakening the interaction between surface-adsorbed H* and the catalytic surface. Moreover, operando spectroscopies and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the enhanced interaction between the catalyst surface and interfacial water by electron delocalization, facilitates the desorption of H* to the interfacial water layer during catalysis. This research highlights the pivotal role of electronic localization in modulating the adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates for the design of efficient Pd-based catalysts.

ABSTRACT The band center of d orbitals ( d ‐band center) has been widely used as an effective descriptor for analyzing material properties. However, in high‐entropy nanoalloys, the diverse atomic environments present challenges in systematically exploring all possible combinations. Due to computational resource limitations, generating a sufficient number of samples is infeasible. Consequently, the d ‐band center should be treated as a response variable in machine‐learning models. We calculated the d ‐band center for individual atoms and applied supervised learning techniques to identify key factors influencing its behavior. While several factors were identified, their physical significance in predicting d ‐band centers remained unclear. To address this issue, we incorporated various interatomic distance terms as descriptors, along with element‐based coordination numbers (ECN). The resulting model closely resembled the overlap integral of the Slater‐type orbital, and the regression coefficients of the ECN exhibited sensitivity to the effective principal quantum number and nuclear charge. Understanding the physical significance of these descriptors is crucial for improving property predictions and facilitating data collection on novel materials.

ABSTRACT Recent advances in single‐atom alloy ( SAA ) catalysts provide a unique platform for understanding spillover, due to the well‐defined nature of the active site for dissociative chemisorption. In particular, the use of spilled adsorbates following molecular dissociation on the host metal surface facilitates the generation of high‐value chemicals in subsequent catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, the factors that control the spillover process remain to be fully elucidated. This perspective discusses recent theoretical advances in the spillover dynamics on SAAs , with a particular focus on the dissociation and spillover processes of H 2 and CH 4 . It provides valuable insights into how various factors, such as energy transfer, nuclear quantum effects, gas‐adsorbate interactions, and adsorbate size, impact the diffusion behavior of hydrogen and methyl species on SAA surfaces. The article concludes with a discussion of future prospects. This perspective underscores the significance of spillover dynamics in heterogeneous catalysis, with important implications for improving catalytic performance.    

    

## Improving the Catalytic Selectivity of Reverse Water–Gas Shift Reaction Catalyzed by Ru/CeO2 Through the Addition of Yttrium Oxide

This study reports the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of a series of catalysts of Ru supported on CeO2-Y2O3 composites (Ru/CeYX; X = 0, 33, 66, and 100 wt.% Y2O3) for CO2 hydrogenation. Supported material modification (Y2O3-CeO2), by the Y2O3 incorporation, allowed a change in selectivity from methane to RWGS of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. This change in selectivity is correlated with the variation in the physicochemical properties caused by Y2O3 addition. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the formation of crystalline fluorite-phase CeO2 and α-Y2O3. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping revealed the formation of a homogeneous CeO2-Y2O3 nanocomposite. As the Y2O3 content increased, the specific surface area, measured by BET, showed a decreasing trend from 106.3 to 51.7 m2 g−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Ce3d indicated a similar Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio across all CeO2-containing materials, while the O1s spectra showed a reduction in oxygen vacancies with increasing Y2O3 content, which is attributed to the decreased surface area upon composite formation. Catalytically, the addition of Y2O3 influenced both conversion and selectivity. CO2 conversion decreased with increasing Y2O3 content, with the lowest conversion observed for Ru/CeY100. Regarding selectivity, methane was the dominant product for Ru/CeY0 (pure CeO2), while CO was the main product for Ru/CeY33, Ru/CeY66, and Ru/CeY100, indicating a shift towards the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The highest RWGS reaction rate was observed with the Ru/CeY33 catalyst under all tested conditions. The observed differences in conversion and selectivity are attributed to a reduction in active sites due to the decrease in surface area and oxygen vacancies, both of which are important for CO2 adsorption. In order to verify the surface species catalytically active for RWGS, the samples were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy under reaction conditions.

This study explores the synthesis and characterization of platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co)-based electrocatalysts using the sol–gel method. The focus is on the effect of different support materials on the catalytic performance in alkaline media. The sol–gel technique enables the production of highly uniform electrocatalysts, supported on carbon-based substrates, metal oxides, and conductive polymers. Various characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were used to analyze the structure of the synthesized materials, while their electrochemical properties, which are relevant to their application in unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs), were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). This hydrogen energy-converting device integrates water electrolyzers and fuel cells into a single system, reducing weight, volume, and cost. However, their performance is constrained by the electrocatalyst’s oxygen bifunctional activity. To improve URFC efficiency, an ideal electrocatalyst should exhibit high oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) activity with a low bifunctionality index (BI). The present study evaluated the prepared electrocatalysts in an alkaline medium, finding that Pt25-Co75/XC72R and Pt75-Co25/N82 demonstrated promising bifunctional activity. The results suggest that these electrocatalysts are well-suited for both electrolysis and fuel cell operation in anion exchange membrane-unitized regenerative fuel cells (AEM-URFCs), contributing to improved round-trip efficiency.

ABSTRACT By the random distribution of metals in a single phase, entropy engineering is applied to construct dense neighboring active centers with diverse electronic and geometric structures, realizing the continuous optimization of multiple primary reactions for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Many catalysts developed through entropy engineering have been built in nearly equimolar ratios to pursue high entropy, hindering the identification of the active sites and potentially diluting the concentration of real active sites while weakening their electronic interactions with reaction intermediates. Herein, this work proposes an entropy‐engineering strategy in metal nanoparticle‐embedded nitrogen carbon electrocatalysts, implemented by entropy‐engineered Prussian blue analogs (PBA) as precursors to enhance the catalytic activity of primary Cu‐Fe active sites. Through the introduction of the micro‐strains driven by entropy engineering, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and geometric phase analysis (GPA) using Lorentz electron microscopy further elucidate the optimization of the adsorption/desorption of intermediates. Furthermore, the multi‐dimensional morphology and the size diminishment of the nanocrystals serve to expand the electrochemical area, maximizing the catalytic activity for both ORR and OER. Notably, the Zn‐air battery assembled with CuFeCoNiZn‐NC operated for over 1300 h with negligible decay. This work presents a paradigm for the design of low‐cost electrocatalysts with entropy engineering for multi‐step reactions.

Pt-based alloys with precisely controllable element distribution are highly sought after in catalysis. This study focuses on optimizing elemental distribution and alloying in PtNi alloy nanowires (NWs) through high-temperature heat treatment. The resulting PtNi alloy NWs with uniform elemental distribution (U-PtNi NWs) demonstrate exceptional stability, attributed to facilitated electron transfer and a denser Pt shell, in stark contrast to untreated NWs that suffer from elemental segregation and subsequent performance degradation during electrochemical testing. In methanol oxidation reaction tests, U-PtNi NWs demonstrated exceptional mass activity (1562.0 mA mg–1) and specific activity (5.38 mA cm–2), with minimal activity loss after 1000 cycles. This work emphasizes the significance of precise component control in developing high-performance catalysts and presents a strategy to enhance fuel cell performance through one-dimensional nanocomponent adjustment.

Renewable biomass serves as a cost-effective source of carbon matrix to carry single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, the natural abundant oxygen in these materials hinders the sufficient dispersion of element with high oxygen affinity such iron (Fe). The lowered-density and oxidized SACs greatly limits their catalytic applications. Here we develop a facile continuous activation (CA) approach for synthesizing robust biomass-derived Fe-SACs. Comparing to the traditional pyrolysis method, the CA approach significantly increases the Fe loading density from 1.13 atoms nm−2 to 4.70 atoms nm−2. Simultaneously, the CA approach induces a distinct coordination tuning from dominated Fe-O to Fe-N moieties. We observe a pH-universal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance over the CA-derived Fe-SACs with a half-wave potential of 0.93 V and 0.78 V vs. RHE in alkaline and acidic electrolyte, respectively. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the increased Fe-N coordination effectively reduces the energy barriers for the ORR, thus enhancing the catalytic activity. The Fe-SACs-based zinc-air batteries show a specific capacity of 792 mA·h·gZn−1 and ultra-long life span of over 650 h at 5 mA cm−2. Developing efficient single-atom catalysts for clean energy technologies is still challenging. Here, the authors report a facile method to increase the density and tune the coordination of iron atom loaded in single-atom catalysts that boosts the activity for pH-universal oxygen electrolysis.

Identifying efficient and physically meaningful descriptors is crucial for the rational design of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. In this study, we systematically investigate the HER activity of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning techniques. By exploring the relationship between key electronic properties, including the conduction band minimum (CBM), pz band center, and hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG*H), we establish a strong linear correlation between the CBM and ΔG*H, identifying the CBM as a reliable and physically meaningful descriptor for HER activity. Furthermore, this correlation is validated in vacancy-defected TMD systems, demonstrating that the CBM remains an effective descriptor even in the presence of structural defects. To enable the rapid and accurate prediction of the CBM, we develop an interpretable three-dimensional model using the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) algorithm. The SISSO model achieves a high predictive accuracy, with correlation coefficients (r) and coefficients of determination (R2) reaching 0.98 and 0.97 in the training and 0.99 and 0.99 in the validation tests, respectively. This study provides an efficient computational framework that combines first-principles calculations and machine learning to accelerate the screening and design of high-performance TMD-based HER catalysts.

This is a review of theoretical and methodological development over the past decade pertaining to computational characterization of thermoelectric materials from first principles. Primary focus is on electronic and thermal transport in solids. Particular attention is given to the relationships between the various methods in terms of the theoretical hierarchy as well as the tradeoff of physical accuracy and computational efficiency of each. Further covered are up-and-coming methods for modeling defect formation and dopability, keys to realizing a material's thermoelectric potential. We present and discuss all these methods in close connection with parallel developments in high-throughput infrastructure and code implementation that enable large-scale computing and materials screening. In all, it is demonstrated that advances in computational tools are now ripe for efficient and accurate targeting of the needles in the haystack, which are “next-generation” thermoelectric materials.

The quantitative evaluation of the carbon hybridization state by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been a surface-analysis problem for the last three decades due to the challenges associated with the unambiguous identification of the characteristic binding energy values for sp2- and sp3-bonded carbon. Here, we computed the binding energy values of C(1s) core electrons on the absolute energy scale for model structures of amorphous carbon (a-C) using density functional theory (DFT). The DFT calculations show that in the case of hydrogen-free a-C, the C(1s) binding energy for sp3 carbon atoms is a distribution found approximately 1 eV higher than the binding energy distribution of sp2-hybridized carbons. However, the introduction of hydrogen in the a-C network reduces the distance between the characteristic signals of sp3- and sp2-bonded carbon due to the increased ability to screen the core hole by neighboring hydrogen atoms as compared to carbon atoms. This effect hinders the unambiguous quantification of the carbon hybridization state on the basis of C(1s) XPS data alone. This work can assist surface scientists in the use of XPS for the accurate characterization of carbon-based materials. Published by the American Physical Society 2025

Abstract Photoreforming of polylactic acid (PLA) waste into valuable chemicals offers a promising approach for environmental protection and waste valorization, yet faces challenges of low yields and harsh conditions. Herein, a Cd 0.5 Zn 0.5 S nanotwin catalyst decorated with Ru single atoms and clusters is reported, enabling selective photoreforming of PLA into pyruvic acid (PA) and H 2 . It is demonstrated that Ru single atoms favor PA formation via hydroxyl dissociation, while the further incorporation of Ru clusters serve as active sites for H 2 production. This synergistic effect significantly enhances photocatalytic performance, achieving 96.8% PA selectivity and efficient H 2 production with a record‐breaking apparent quantum efficiency of 83.7% at 400 nm. This approach is scalable for outdoor processes, utilizing direct 1 m 2 sunlight irradiation to deliver ≈1191 mL h −1 of H 2 and 47.27 mmol h −1 of PA from PLA waste, paving a viable pathway for large‐scale simultaneous production of high‐value chemicals and H 2 .

Abstract Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to their 100% atomic utilization efficiency. The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to CO using SAC offers a promising approach for CO 2 utilization, but achieving facile CO 2 adsorption and CO desorption remains challenging for traditional SACs. Instead of singling out specific atoms, we propose a strategy utilizing atoms from the entire lanthanide (Ln) group to facilitate the CO 2 RR. Density functional theory calculations, operando spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate the bridging adsorption mechanism for a representative erbium (Er) single-atom catalyst. As a result, we realize a series of Ln SACs spanning 14 elements that exhibit CO Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. The Er catalyst achieves a high turnover frequency of ~130,000 h − 1 at 500 mA cm − 2 . Moreover, 34.7% full-cell energy efficiency and 70.4% single-pass CO 2 conversion efficiency are obtained at 200 mA cm − 2 with acidic electrolyte. This catalytic platform leverages the collective potential of the lanthanide group, introducing new possibilities for efficient CO 2 -to-CO conversion and beyond through the exploration of unique bonding motifs in single-atom catalysts.

Alkyl sulfonated polyimides (ASPIs), as alternative polymer electrolytes for fuel cells, are known to exhibit lyotropic liquid crystalline behavior upon water uptake, forming organized lamellar structures and achieving high proton conductivity. Previous experimental studies have shown that ASPIs with planar backbones exhibit enhanced proton conductivity (0.2 S/cm) compared to those with bent backbones (0.03 S/cm). To explain this difference at the atomistic level, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted using a universal neural network potential. The appearance of monomer unit length in planar ASPIs, indicating higher molecular order, was found to correlate with higher proton conductivity compared to that of bent ASPIs. Despite the similar deprotonation and solvation of sulfonic acid groups in both planar and bent ASPIs, the proton conductivity was independent of these factors. Directional mean square displacement analysis provided further insights into the differences in proton conductivity between planar and bent types.

ABSTRACT With the increasing global demand for energy transition and environmental sustainability, catalysts play a vital role in mitigating global climate change, as they facilitate over 90% of chemical and material conversions. It is important to investigate the complex structures and properties of catalysts for enhanced performance, for which artificial intelligence (AI) methods, especially graph neural networks (GNNs) could be useful. In this article, we explore the cutting‐edge applications and future potential of GNNs in intelligent catalyst design. The fundamental theories of GNNs and their practical applications in catalytic material simulation and inverse design are first reviewed. We analyze the critical roles of GNNs in accelerating material screening, performance prediction, reaction pathway analysis, and mechanism modeling. By leveraging graph convolution techniques to accurately represent molecular structures, integrating symmetry constraints to ensure physical consistency, and applying generative models to efficiently explore the design space, these approaches work synergistically to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of catalyst design. Furthermore, we highlight high‐quality databases crucial for catalysis research and explore the innovative application of GNNs in thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and biocatalysis. In the end, we highlight key directions for advancing GNNs in catalysis: dynamic frameworks for real‐time conditions, hierarchical models linking atomic details to catalyst features, multi‐task networks for performance prediction, and interpretability mechanisms to reveal critical reaction pathways. We believe these advancements will significantly broaden the role of GNNs in catalysis science, paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and sustainable catalyst design methodologies.

Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl3 in water.
