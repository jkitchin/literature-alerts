Abstract Electrosynthesis of NH3 from low-concentration NO (NORR) in neutral media offers a sustainable nitrogen fixation strategy but is hindered by weak NO adsorption, slow water dissociation, and sluggish hydrogenation kinetics. Herein, we propose a new strategy that successfully overcomes these limitations through using an electron-donating motif to modulate NO-affinitive catalysts, thereby creating dual active site with synergistic functionality. Specifically, we integrate electron-donating nanoparticles into a Fe single-atom catalyst (FeSAC), where Fe sites ensure strong NO adsorption, while electron-donating motifs promote water dissociation and NO hydrogenation. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), and theoretical calculations reveal that electron-donating motifs increase Fe site electron density, strengthening NO adsorption. Additionally, these motifs also promote water dissociation, supplying protons to lower the NO hydrogenation barrier. This synergistic interplay enables a cascade reaction mechanism, delivering a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.3% and a NH3 yield rate of 709.7 µg h− 1 mgcat.−1 under 1.0 vol% NO in neutral media, outperforming pure FeSAC (NH3 yield rate: 444.2 µg h− 1 mgcat.−1, FE: 56.6%) and prior high-NO-concentration systems. Notably, a record NH3 yield of 3123.8 µg h− 1 mgcat.−1 was achieved in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer under a 1.0 vol% NO. This work establishes a new paradigm in NORR by simultaneously enhancing NO adsorption, water dissociation, and hydrogenation kinetics, providing a scalable route for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis from dilute NO sources.

Citation metrics influence academic reputation and career trajectories. Recent works have highlighted flaws in citation practices in the Neurosciences, such as the under-citation of women. However, self-citation rates—or how much authors cite themselves—have not yet been comprehensively investigated in the Neurosciences. This work characterizes self-citation rates in basic, translational, and clinical Neuroscience literature by collating 100,347 articles from 63 journals between the years 2000-2020. In analyzing over five million citations, we demonstrate four key findings: 1) increasing self-citation rates of Last Authors relative to First Authors, 2) lower self-citation rates in low- and middle-income countries, 3) gender differences in self-citation stemming from differences in the number of previously published papers, and 4) variations in self-citation rates by field. Our characterization of self-citation provides insight into citation practices that shape the perceived influence of authors in the Neurosciences, which in turn may impact what type of scientific research is done and who gets the opportunity to do it.

Abstract The development of high‐performance ORR catalysts is challenged by the understanding how the delocalized electrons in s ‐ and p ‐orbitals influence oxygen intermediate adsorption and overall catalytic performance. To address these challenges, the from active unit to bulk catalyst (FAUC) design strategy is employed to investigate the roles of s‐ and p‐ orbitals in ORR activity. Specifically, six M‐N 4 ‐OH (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) catalyst systems are constructed and analyzed using density functional theory (DFT), this study reveals that, compared to d ‐orbitals, the delocalized electrons in the s‐ and p‐ orbitals (N s,p ) exhibit a significant volcano relationship with ORR activity. This superior predictive capability arises from the weaker dependence of s‐ and p‐ orbitals on the local coordination environment. Additionally, a structure‐activity relationship is established where shortening M─O and M─N bond lengths significantly increases N s,p . Through modification strategies such as doping and loading, the Co─N bond lengths are regulated in Co‐N 4 ‐OH‐C, resulting in shorter bonds and increased N s,p , which shifted ORR catalytic activity closer to the volcano peak. These findings validate the N s,p descriptor's rationality and universality across various 3 d transition metals, providing new insights for the design of high‐performance ORR catalysts.

Abstract Materials with the same chemical composition can exhibit distinct properties depending on their crystal phases. Here, the synthesis of two types of mesoporous Bi 2 Se 3 films at different reduction potentials is reported and their application in electrochemical glucose sensing. Mesoporous Bi 2 Se 3 is synthesized by incorporating block copolymer micelle assemblies into the deposition solution and applying a reduction potential. To characterize the crystal phases accurately, Bi 2 Se 3 films are heat‐treated at 200 °C for 1 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. The results reveal that the Bi 2 Se 3 films synthesized under different conditions exhibit clearly distinct phases: rhombohedral ( R ‐Bi 2 Se 3 ) and orthorhombic ( O ‐Bi 2 Se 3 ). The R ‐Bi 2 Se 3 ‐8 nm, featuring 8 nm pores and synthesized at a more negative reduction potential, outperforms its nonporous counterpart, achieving a glucose sensing sensitivity of 0.143 µA cm −2 µM −1 and a detection limit of 6.2 µM at pH 7.4 in 0.1 M phosphate‐buffered saline solution. In contrast, the O ‐Bi 2 Se 3 , prepared at a relatively positive potential, exhibits no glucose‐sensing activity. The inactivity of O ‐Bi 2 Se 3 for glucose oxidation is likely due to the energetically unfavorable intermediates, as predicted by density functional theory calculations. These findings underscore the critical role of crystal phase control in porous nanomaterials and pave the way for developing innovative porous systems.

The development of renewable energy-powered water electrolysis technology serves as a crucial prerequisite for realizing the large-scale application of hydrogen economy. Currently, commercial catalysts for water electrolysis predominantly rely on platinum-group noble metals, whose scarcity and exorbitant costs significantly hinder practical implementation of hydrogen production through water splitting. As promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable research attention due to their high intrinsic catalytic activity and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the catalytic performance of TMDs still lags behind that of noble metal benchmarks, prompting extensive and systematic investigations into performance enhancement and catalytic mechanisms. This review comprehensively summarizes strategic approaches for optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of TMDs in water electrolysis, integrating fundamental reaction principles, rational design philosophies for electrocatalysts, and the structure-property relationships of TMDs. Finally, we provide insightful perspectives on current challenges and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Molecular catalysts with functional group decorations are promising for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction to produce valuable chemicals and fuels. Using nickel phthalocyanine derivatives with cyano, methoxy, and dimethylamino groups, this study unveils why decorating molecular catalysts with either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups can enhance their activity. Notably, the dimethylamino group–decorated catalyst demonstrated stable and nearly 100% CO 2 -to-CO reduction selectivity over a wide potential range and high CO partial current densities up to 300 milliamperes per square centimeter. Theoretical and in situ spectroscopic analyses revealed the critical role of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in activating the metal center, which can be facilitated by the decoration of electron-withdrawing groups. Conversely, electron-donating groups, although requiring higher energy for protonation, enhance the synergy between metal centers and protonated sites, favoring the formation of key *COOH intermediates and improving CO selectivity at higher bias. This study underscores the importance of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in optimizing functionalized molecular catalysts for enhanced CO 2 RR activity.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction provides a sustainable route to combat climate change by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals by using sunlight. This study presents both experimental and theoretical insights into the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH using biomass-derived carbon dots embedded onto phytochemical-based CdS quantum dots. The 0D CDs/CdS QDs(bio) composites exhibit rich sulfur vacancies and a more negative conduction band, effectively inhibiting CdS photocorrosion (SO42-) while enhancing the CO2 adsorption and photocurrent response. Additionally, it reduced PL intensity and increased decay time, suggesting the enhancement of charge separation and suppression of charge recombination. The optimal 0.4CDs/CdS QDs(bio) composite exhibited a remarkable CO2 reduction to HCOOH formation yield of 439.51 μmol g-1 h-1 (apparent quantum yield of 3.81%) while retaining its structural and morphological stability. Density functional theory calculations reveal HCOO* as a key intermediate, confirming the thermodynamic preference for HCOOH formation over CO with a free energy change of -0.71 eV. This study introduces a novel bio-based CdS QDs composite modified with biomass-derived CDs, providing mechanistic insights into photocatalytic CO2 reduction for sustainable fuel production.

We introduce a shadow molecular dynamics (MD) approach based on the Atom-Condensed Kohn-Sham second-order (ACKS2) charge-potential equilibration model. In contrast to regular flexible charge models, the ACKS2 model includes both flexible atomic charges and potential fluctuation parameters that allow for physically correct charge fragmentation and improved scaling of the polarizability. Our shadow MD scheme is based on an approximation of the ACKS2's flexible charge-potential energy function, in combination with extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer MD. Utilizing this shadow charge-potential equilibration approach mitigates the costly overhead and stability problems associated with finding well-converged iterative solutions to the charges and potential fluctuations of the ACKS2 model in an MD simulation. Our work provides a robust and versatile framework for efficient, high-fidelity MD simulations of diverse physical phenomena and applications.

Non-platinum group metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions were developed using a CoN4 complex with a 14-membered-ring hexaazamacrocyclic ligand (Co-14MR). The carbon-supported Co-14MR catalyst (Co-14MR/C) showed higher ORR and HER activities than a conventional carbon-supported 16-membered-ring Co phthalocyanine (CoPc/C) catalyst. Heat treatment of Co-14MR/C at 600 °C further enhanced its ORR and HER activity through structural modification of the Co active center via deprotonation of ligand amine groups. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the structural modifications of Co-14MR induced by heat treatment adjusted the adsorption energies of important intermediates in the ORR and HER toward optimal values, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. The Co-14MR/C catalysts also exhibited higher durability in the ORR and HER than CoPc/C and Fe-14MR/C catalysts. Structural analysis suggested that the short Co-N bond lengths and small distortion of the CoN4 active site of the Co-14MR catalysts are the reasons for their high durability. These findings suggest that the Co-14MR structure is a promising design for non-platinum group metal catalysts for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells and water splitting.

Abstract High entropy oxides (HEOs) have recently emerged as excellent alternative catalysts that can potentially replace noble metal catalysts such as RuO 2 and IrO 2 for water splitting applications. However, existing methods of synthesizing these catalysts are often tedious. In this work, a straightforward method is proposed using ultra‐fast laser irradiation to synthesize heavily wrinkled noble metal‐free (CoCuFeMnNi) 3 O 4 HEO 2‐D sheets on nickel foam for excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. These sheets facilitate the OER at a low overpotential of only 245 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 and is stable after 100 h of testing. This performance outmatches the majority of recently reported noble and noble metal‐free HEA and HEO catalysts. As an anode in anion exchange water electrolyzer (AEMWE), a remarkably high current density of 1.722 A cm −2 is achieved at 2.0 V with negligible catalyst deterioration despite 70 h of testing. This result outranks the majority of other state‐of‐the‐art AEMWE catalysts reported today. This work proves that laser irradiation synthesis enables the synthesis of efficient HEO catalysts, and is a pioneer synthesis of HEO 2‐D interconnected sheets using laser irradiation. Crucially, this work proves that noble‐metal free HEOs are highly efficient and durable catalysts in industrial AEMWE devices.

Abstract Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis holds promise for green hydrogen production. One of the main challenges is the preparation of highly efficient electrodes with scalable techniques. Herein, a novel Fe‐modulating Raney‐Ni electrode (NFA‐CA) is developed through atmospheric plasma spraying and chemical etching techniques. The resulting electrode demonstrates high bifunctional catalytic activities with low overpotentials and Tafel slopes (HER: 27 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , 20 mV dec −1 ; OER: 169 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , 49 mV dec −1 ), competing for precious‐metal catalysts and leading transition‐metal‐based compounds reported in the literature. Moreover, the corresponding AEM electrolyzer only requires 1.56 V to drive 1 A cm −2 and exceptional durability for 1000 h. Moreover, the AEM cell can reach 2 A cm −2 at 1.79 V, exceeding the United States Department of Energy target for AWE systems (2 A cm −2 at 1.80 V). The highly efficient and durable performance is attributed to the NiFe nanocrystals (core)‐NiFe hydroxide (shell) nanostructures created by the treatment. This structure not only facilitates superior electrocatalytic properties but it is also maintained after 1000 h of continuous operation. It is consider that the present approach can offer an attractive route for scalable fabrication of NiFe‐based electrodes for industrial AEM water electrolyzers.

Stable, nonprecious catalysts are vital for large-scale alkaline water electrolysis. Here, we report a grafted superstructure, MOF@POM, formed by self-assembling a metal-organic framework (MOF) with polyoxometalate (POM). In situ electrochemical transformation converts MOF into active metal (oxy)hydroxides to produce a catalyst with a low overpotential of 178 millivolts at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. An anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporating this catalyst achieves 3 amperes per square centimeter at 1.78 volts at 80°C and stable operation at 2 amperes per square centimeter for 5140 hours at room temperature. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the synergistic interactions between metal atoms create a fast electron-transfer channel from catalytic iron and cobalt sites, nickel, and tungsten in the polyoxometalate to the electrode, stabilizing the metal sites and preventing dissolution.

The graphitized carbon blocks are used as cathode and anode materials on modern aluminum electrolyzers, which provide a reaction interface between molten salts and a graphitized cathode for the electrochemical reaction. The first-principle calculations were performed to clarify the defluorination mechanism of fluoro-aluminates on graphite cathodes in aluminum electrolysis for energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction. The adsorption behaviors of intermediates involved in defluorination reactions on graphite surfaces are analyzed, revealing their spontaneous adsorption based on their adsorption energies and charge density differences. Furthermore, the defluorination pathways of both single Na3AlF6 clusters and fluoride-aluminate polymers are elucidated. Notably, Na3AlF6, after undergoing the thermochemical defluorination process to obtain AlF3, preferentially undergoes electrochemical defluorination via Al-F-Al polymerization. The key findings indicate that the chemical defluorination of Na3AlF6 leading to NaAlF4 serves as a pivotal step, facilitating the overall defluorination process and enhancing the aluminum production efficiency. This work provides fundamental insights into optimizing aluminum electrolysis processes.

Water's ability to autoionize into hydroxide and hydronium ions profoundly influences surface properties, rendering interfaces either basic or acidic. While it is well-established that protons show an affinity to the air-water interface, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and further away from it. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals local polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.

Abstract The stability of a nanoparticle catalyst during electrochemical reaction is crucial for its application. Despite increasing interest in multi-metallic alloy nanoparticles, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs), for electrocatalysis and emerging models for their catalytic activity, there is limited work on frameworks that can predict the metastability of these alloys under reaction conditions, including stability against electrochemical surface dissolution. Incorporating electrochemical stability in multi-objective optimization would advance HEAs as a catalyst discovery platform. To address the knowledge gap on electrochemical stability, we propose a methodology for simulating the dissolution of n-element alloy nanoparticles comprised of density functional theory and machine-learning regression to calculate the dissolution potentials of the surface atoms. We demonstrate the methodology for the Ag–Au–Cu–Ir–Pd–Pt–Rh–Ru HEA system with the conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction. We investigated trends in stability against dissolution through a compositional grid search for the octo-metallic composition space, uncovering two alloying strategies to increase stability against electrochemical surface dissolution: Alloying with a noble metal or a metal with high relative surface energy. In the simulations, stabilization ensues from forming a protective surface layer, and consequently, the dissolution of persistent alloyed nanoparticles results in core–shell structures. The model enables tracing the evolution of the surface and dissolved composition during electrochemical dissolution, forming paths of dissolution and revealing unretainable surface compositions.

Grain boundary chemistry plays a critical role for the properties of metals and alloys, yet there is a lack of consistent datasets for alloy design and development. With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials science, open materials models and datasets can be used to overcome such challenges. Here, we use a universal interatomic potential to compute a grain boundary segregation and embrittlement genome for the Σ5[001](210) grain boundary for FCC and BCC binary alloys. The grain boundary database calculated here serves as a design tool for the embrittlement of high-angle grain boundaries for alloys across 30 base metals of Ag, Al, Au, Ba, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe (both BCC and FCC), Ir, K, Li, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Rb, Rh, Sr, Ta, Ti, V, W, Yb, and Zr with 75 solute elements for each.

Abstract Nickel‐based catalysts are among the most promising materials for electrocatalytic water splitting, particularly for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Their abundance, cost‐effectiveness, and tunable electrochemical properties make them attractive alternatives to precious metal catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the advancements in nickel‐based catalysts, including pure nickel, alloys, oxides, hydroxides, and spinels, emphasizing their synthesis methods, structural properties, and electrocatalytic performance. Recent nanostructuring, doping, and hybridization innovations with conductive supports have significantly enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and efficiency. Despite notable progress, challenges remain in improving long‐term durability, minimizing surface degradation, and scaling up production for industrial applications. Addressing these limitations through advanced catalyst design, in situ characterization, and integration with renewable energy sources will be crucial for widely adopting nickel‐based catalysts in sustainable hydrogen production. This review highlights the key developments and future directions in the field, underscoring the role of nickel‐based materials in enabling the hydrogen economy and global decarbonization efforts.

The activation of CO 2 is essential for efficient electrochemical conversion, yet its weak physisorption on pristine Cu surfaces severely hinders catalytic performance. To overcome this limitation, we designed Cu stepped structures to create highly reactive sites for enhanced CO 2 adsorption and further doped the edges with 3 d transition metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) to improve CO 2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these dopants significantly reduce the OCO angles and elongate the CO bonds, transforming CO 2 from its original linear configuration into a bent geometry at the interface. Notably, dual‐V and dual‐Fe doping on Cu stepped surfaces demonstrates a strong interaction with CO 2 , leading to a high degree of activation. The computational results demonstrate that these modifications significantly enhance CO 2 activation and favor methane generation. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced Cu‐based electrocatalysts for efficient and selective CO 2 activation, offering a pathway toward sustainable CO 2 utilization.

Abstract For neural network potentials (NNPs) to gain widespread use, researchers must be able to trust model outputs. However, the blackbox nature of neural networks and their inherent stochasticity are often deterrents, especially for foundation models trained over broad swaths of chemical space. Uncertainty information provided at the time of prediction can help reduce aversion to NNPs. In this work, we detail two uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. Readout ensembling, by finetuning the readout layers of an ensemble of foundation models, provides information about model uncertainty, while quantile regression, by replacing point predictions with distributional predictions, provides information about uncertainty within the underlying training data. We demonstrate our approach with the MACE-MP-0 model, applying UQ to the foundation model and a series of finetuned models. The uncertainties produced by the readout ensemble and quantile methods are demonstrated to be distinct measures by which the quality of the NNP output can be judged.

The electron density is an important object in quantum chemistry that is crucial for many downstream tasks in drug design. Recent deep learning approaches predict the electron density around a molecule from atom types and atom positions. Most of these methods use the plane wave (PW) numerical method as a source of ground-truth training data. However, the drug design field mostly uses the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) for computation of quantum properties. In this study, we focus on prediction of the electron density for drug-like substances and training neural networks with LCAO-based datasets. Our experiments show that proper handling of large amplitudes of core orbitals is crucial for training on LCAO-based data. We propose to store the electron density with the standard grids instead of the uniform grid. This allowed us to reduce the number of probing points per molecule by 43 times and reduce storage space requirements by 8 times. Finally, we propose a novel architecture based on the DeepDFT model that we name LAGNet. It is specifically designed and tuned for drug-like substances and ∇2 DFT dataset.

Machine learning and automation are transforming scientific research, yet the implementation of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) remains costly and complex, and it remains difficult to learn how to use these facilities. To address this, we introduce Claude-Light, a lightweight, remotely accessible instrument designed for prototyping automation algorithms and machine learning workflows. Claude-Light integrates a REST API, a Raspberry Pi-based control system, and an RGB LED with a photometer that measures ten spectral outputs, providing a controlled but realistic experimental environment. This device enables users to explore automation at multiple levels, from basic programming and experimental design to machine learning-driven optimization. We demonstrate the application of Claude-Light in structured automation approaches, including traditional scripting, statistical design of experiments, and active learning methods. In addition, we explore the role of large language models (LLMs) in laboratory automation, highlighting their use in instrument selection, structured data extraction, function calling, and code generation. While LLMs present new opportunities for streamlining automation, they also introduce challenges related to reproducibility, security, and reliability. We discuss strategies to mitigate these risks while leveraging LLMs for enhanced efficiency in self-driving laboratories. Claude-Light provides a practical and accessible platform for students and researchers to develop automation skills and test algorithms before deploying them in larger-scale SDLs. By lowering the barrier to entry for automation in scientific research, this tool facilitates broader adoption of AI-driven experimentation and fosters innovation in autonomous laboratories.
