The FeFe bio-inspired molecular catalysts that mimic the [FeFe] hydrogenases have been widely studied. However, the hydrogen evolution mechanism on the molecular catalysts is still not fully understood. In this work, the theoretical calculation was linked with experimental catalytic performance to reveal the possible reaction mechanism of FeFe molecular catalysts. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on the FeFe molecular catalysts exhibited a good match with the experimental overpotential data, with a R2 of 0.592. The detailed DFT study indicated that the first H+/e− injection was the largest thermodynamic impediment in the whole hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cycle which follows a proton transfer – electron transfer (PT-ET) mechanism. The injected hydrogen binds to the bridging position between FeFe centre (µ-H) and then transfers to a terminal hydrogen on Fe (t-H). Later, the t-H combines with the second injected hydrogen to form a H2 molecule which is then released from the catalyst. The effect of different ligands on HER was also studied. It was found that different ligands around the FeFe centre could significantly change the PT and ET energy, and some could provide additional binding sites for protons.

Solar-driven CO2 reduction to value-added C2 chemicals is thermodynamically challenging due to multiple complicated steps. The design of active sites and structures for photocatalysts is necessary to improve solar energy efficiency. In this work, atomically dispersed Ru-O sites in RuxIn2-xO3 are constructed by interior lattice anchoring of Ru. This results in the dynamic reconstruction of Ruδ+-O/Ru0-O sites upon photoexcitation, which facilitates the CO2 activation, *CO intermediates adsorption, and C-C coupling as demonstrated by varied in situ techniques. A SiO2 core in RuxIn2-xO3/SiO2 construction further enhances the solar energy utilization and individual RuxIn2-xO3 nanocrystals dispersion for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. It results in the maximum ethanol production rate up to 31.6 μmol/g/h with over 90% selectivity. DFT simulation reveals that the C2 dimer formation primarily underwent an asymmetric *CO-*CHO coupling route via a low-energy precedence ladder of *CHO. This work provides an insightful understanding of active sites with dynamic reconstruction towards asymmetric C-C coupling for CO2RR at the atomic scale. Understanding the role of atomic sites in photocatalytic CO2 reduction remains challenging. This study provides insights into dynamic Ruδ+-O/Ru0-O pair reconstruction and explores approaches to enhancing intermediate regulation and asymmetric *CO-*CHO coupling for producing C2+ products.

Computational modeling of metal–oxide interfaces is challenging due to the large search space of compositions and structures and the complexity of catalyst materials under operating conditions in general. In this work, we develop an efficient structure search workflow to discover chemically unique and relevant nanocluster geometries of inverse catalysts and apply it to ZnyOx and InyOx on Cu(111), Pd(111), and Au(111). We show that the workflow is successful in obtaining a large range of chemically distinct structures. Structural geometry trends are identified, including stable motifs such as tripod, rhombus, and pyramidal motifs. Using ab initio thermodynamics, we explore the in situ stability of the structures, including single-atom alloys, at a range of oxygen availabilities. This approach allows us to find trends such as the susceptibility to oxidation of the different systems and the range of stability of different cluster motifs. Our analysis highlights the importance of taking the diversity of sites exposed by metal–oxide interfaces into account in catalyst design studies.

ABSTRACT With the advances of nanochemistry in the past several decades, a diverse set of nanomaterials has been developed as electrocatalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and durability for electrocatalytic reactions. However, it has remained as a long challenge to systematically understand the mechanism of electrocatalytic reactions, which involves multiple protons‐coupled electron transfer processes and varied products at the atomic level, intrinsically because of the complexity and polydispersity of the traditional nanomaterials. By sharp contrast, ligand‐protected metal nanoclusters (NCs) possess atomically precise structures and abundant active sites, facilitating their applications as effective model electrocatalysts for revealing the mechanism of electrocatalytic reactions. This review summarizes recent progress in atom‐level engineering of metal NCs as model catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions. Specifically, we first discuss the effects of metal composition engineering, including doping and size effects, on the electrocatalytic performance of metal NCs. Then similar electrocatalytic discussion extends to ligand effects of metal NCs, where ligand type and coverage engineering are deciphered. Moreover, we discuss how the overall charge and morphology of NCs modify their electrocatalytic performance. The fundamental and methodological insights summarized in this review should serve as useful references guiding the future development of effective metal electrocatalysts in diverse sectors of industry.

Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) is promising to not only tackle environmental issues caused by nitrate but also produce ammonia at room temperatures. However, two critical challenges are the lack of effective electrocatalysts and the understanding of related reaction mechanisms. To overcome these challenges, we employed first-principles calculations to thoroughly study the performance and mechanisms of triple-atom catalysts (TACs) composed of transition metals (including 27 homonuclear TACs and 4 non-noble bimetallic TACs) anchored on N-doped carbon (NC). We found five promising candidates possessing not only thermodynamic and electrochemical stability, but also high activity and selectivity for ammonia production. Among them, non-noble homonuclear Ni3@NC TAC show high activity with low theoretical limiting potential of −0.31 VRHE. Surprisingly, bimetallic Co2Ni@NC, Co2Cu@NC, and Fe2Ni@NC TACs show ultrahigh activity with theoretical limiting potentials of 0.00 VRHE, without a potential determining step in the whole reaction pathways, representing the best theoretical activity been reported up to date. These promising candidates are facilitated by circumventing the limit of scaling relationships, a well-known obstacle for single-atom catalysts. This study indicates that designing suitable TACs can be a promising strategy for efficiently electro-catalyzing NO3RR and breaking the limit of the scaling relationship.

Abstract The industrial application of green hydrogen production from water electrolysis strongly depends on the invention of low‐cost, highly‐active, and stable nonprecious electrocatalysts for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a two‐step process is developed to prepare a NiCo‐Se/CFP bimetallic electrocatalyst by a low‐temperature selenization of NiCo‐PBA precursors electro‐deposited on carbon fibre paper. The NiCo‐Se/CFP bimetallic electrocatalyst exhibits good catalytic activity for the OER, with an overpotential of 307 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , and a Tafel slope of only 39.94 mV dec −1 in 1 M KOH. The steady current density and well‐preserved microscopic morphology during the 20 h electrolysis proves its outstanding stability. The high inherent activity of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the 3D porous structure, the synergistic effects of Ni, and Co active components doping, and low‐temperature selenization. The results provide an insightful reference for further improving composition and structure design while investigating nonprecious metal electrocatalysts.

Abstract Catalysts are essential for achieving high‐performance lithium–sulfur batteries. The precise design and regulation of catalytic sites to strengthen their efficiency and robustness remains challenging. In this study, spinel sulfides and catalyst design principles through element doping are investigated. This research highlights the distinct role of lattice sulfur sites in lithium polysulfide conversion and emphasizes the differences in catalytic activity between metal and anion sites. The valence electron model as a descriptor can characterize catalytic performance, guiding the design of a (FeCo) 3 (PS) 4 catalyst co‐doped with cation and anion. The (FeCo) 3 (PS) 4 exhibits the highest catalytic performance among spinel catalysts to data, particularly under high sulfur loading conditions. It achieves an initial specific capacity of 1205.9 mAh g −1 (6.1 mAh cm −2 ) at a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm −2 and 1192.7 mAh g −1 (11.9 mAh cm −2 ) at 10 mg cm −2 , demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic performance.

Developing clean and renewable energy technologies requires the design of efficient bifunctional catalysts that do not rely on inert metals for electrochemical water splitting. This study introduced a novel three-step strategy to fabricate NiCoFe-modified MoNi4/MoO2 nanowires supported on nickel foam substrates (denoted as NiCoFe-MoNi4/MoO2/NF), which demonstrate excellent catalytic performance with an impressively low overpotential of just 13 mV at 10 mA·cm–2 current density for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 230 mV at 50 mA·cm–2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, its performance greatly exceeded that of many noble-metal catalysts, requiring only 1.51 V for overall water splitting at 50 mA·cm–2 current density. The exceptional catalytic efficiency is ascribed to the unique one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure and the synergistic interactions between the NiCoFe complex and the MoNi4/MoO2 framework, which improve mass transfer, increase active site exposure, and enhance intrinsic catalytic activity. The incorporation of cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) into the ternary complex significantly enhanced the efficiencies of both HER and OER, offering a promising route for developing high-performance, low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts and advancing sustainable energy conversion technologies.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting material properties, yet they often struggle to capture many-body interactions and require extensive manual feature engineering. Here, we present EOSnet (Embedded Overlap Structures for Graph Neural Networks), a novel approach that addresses these limitations by incorporating Gaussian Overlap Matrix (GOM) fingerprints as node features within the GNN architecture. Unlike models that rely on explicit angular terms or human-engineered features, EOSnet efficiently encodes many-body interactions through orbital overlap matrices, providing a rotationally invariant and transferable representation of atomic environments. The model demonstrates superior performance across various prediction tasks of materials' properties, achieving particularly notable results in properties sensitive to many-body interactions. For band gap prediction, EOSnet achieves a mean absolute error of 0.163 eV, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models. The model also excels in predicting mechanical properties and classifying materials, with 97.7% accuracy in metal/nonmetal classification. These results demonstrate that embedding GOM fingerprints into node features enhances the ability of GNNs to capture complex atomic interactions, making EOSnet a powerful tool for materials' discovery and property prediction.

Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have emerged as a generation of nonprecious catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), largely due to their theoretical hydrogen adsorption energy close to that of platinum. However, efforts to activate the basal planes of TMDs have primarily centered around strategies such as introducing numerous atomic vacancies, creating vacancy–heteroatom complexes, or applying significant strain, especially for acidic media. These approaches, while potentially effective, present substantial challenges in practical large-scale deployment. Here, we report a gap-state engineering strategy for the controlled activation of S atom in MoS2 basal planes through metal single-atom doping, effectively tackling both efficiency and stability challenges in alkaline water and seawater splitting. A versatile synthetic methodology allows for the fabrication of a series of single-metal atom-doped MoS2 materials (M1/MoS2), featuring widely tunable densities with each dopant replacing a Mo site. Among these (Mn1, Fe1, Co1, and Ni1), Co1/MoS2 demonstrates outstanding HER performance in both alkaline and seawater alkaline media, with overpotentials at a mere 159 and 164 mV at 100 mA cm–2, and Tafel slopes at 41 and 45 mV dec–1, respectively, which surpasses all reported TMD-based nonprecious materials and benchmark Pt/C catalysts in HER efficiency and stability during seawater splitting, which can be attributed to an optimal gap-state modulation associated with sulfur atoms. Experimental data correlating doping density and dopant identity with HER performance, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, also reveal a descriptor linked to near-Fermi gap state modulation, corroborated by the observed increase in unoccupied S 3p states.

Abstract Construction of core–shell structured electrocatalysts with a thin noble metal shell is an effective strategy for lowering the usage of the noble metal and improving electrocatalytic properties because of the structure‐induced geometric and electronic effects. Here, the synthesis of a novel core–shell structured nanocatalyst consisting of a thin amorphous Pd shell and a crystalline PdCu core and its significantly improved electrocatalytic properties for both formic acid oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions are shown. The electrocatalyst exhibits 4.1 times higher catalytic peak current density and better stability in the formic acid oxidation compared to both a PdCu nanoalloy catalyst and a Commercial Pd–C catalyst. An excellent electrocatalytic performance of the core–shell nanocatalyst is also observed in the oxygen reduction reaction. Computational calculation results reveal that tuning of the electronic state of Pd by the amorphous shell and the Cu in the PdCu core weaken the binding strength of surface Pd─O bonds, leading to a bond elongation to facilitate bond breaking. As a result, the electrocatalytic activity in both formic acid oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions is enhanced.

Abstract Correlating the bond strength with the macro strength of metals is crucial for understanding mechanical properties and designing multi-principal-element alloys (MPEAs). Motivated by the role of grain boundaries in the strength of metals, we introduce a predictive model to determine the grain-boundary energies and strength of metals from the cohesive energy and atomic radius. This scheme originates from the d-band characteristics and broken-bond spirit of tight-binding models, and demonstrates that the repulsive/attractive effects play different roles in the variation of bond strength for different metals. Importantly, our framework not only applies to both pure metals and MPEAs, but also unravels the distinction of the bond strength caused by elemental compositions, lattice structures, high-entropy, and amorphous effects. These findings build a physical picture across bond strength, grain-boundary energies and strength of metals by using easily accessible material properties and provide a robust method for the design of high-strength alloys.

The formation of non-ion conducting byproducts on zinc anode is notoriously detrimental to aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, we successfully transform a representative detrimental byproduct, crystalline zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) to fast-ion conducting solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) via amorphization and fluorination induced by suspending CaF2 nanoparticles in dilute sulfate electrolytes. Distinct from widely reported nonhomogeneous organic–inorganic hybrid SEIs that exhibit structural and chemical instability, the designed single-phase SEI is homogeneous, mechanically robust, and chemically stable. These characteristics of the SEI facilitate the prevention of zinc dendrite growth and reduction of capacity loss during long-term cycling. Importantly, AZIB full cells based on this SEI-forming electrolyte exhibit exceptional stability over 20,000 cycles at 3 A/g with a charging voltage of 2.2 V without short circuits and electrolyte dry-out. This work suggests avenues for designing SEIs on a metal anode and provides insights into associated SEI chemistry.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) promise quantum-level accuracy at classical force field speeds, but their performance hinges on the quality and diversity of training data. An efficient and fully automated approach to sample chemical reaction space without relying on human intuition, addressing a critical gap in MLIP development is presented. The method combines the speed of tight-binding calculations with selective high-level refinement, generating diverse datasets that capture both equilibrium and reactive regions of potential energy surfaces. By employing single-ended growing string and nudged elastic band methods, reaction pathways previously underrepresented in MLIP training sets, particularly near transition states are systematically explored. This approach yields datasets with rich structural and chemical diversity, essential for robust MLIP development. Open-source code is provided for the entire workflow, facilitating the integration of the approach into existing MLIP development pipelines.

Abstract The conversion of nitrate‐rich wastewater and biomass‐derived blocks into high‐value products using renewably generated electricity is a promising approach to modulate the artificial carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, a new synthetic strategy of WO x sub‐nanoclusters is reported and supported on carbon materials as novel efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and its coupling with α‐keto acids. In acidic solutions, the NH 3 ‐NH 2 OH selectivity can also optimized by adjusting the potential, with the total FE exceeding 80% over a wide potential range. After introducing α‐keto acids, the WO x /D‐CB electrode achieves remarkable activity and selectivity toward C 2 ‐C 6 amino acids. For glycine and alanine, impressive FEs of 49.34% and 38.22% based on transitional metal oxides can be obtained, surpassing those of WO x nanoclusters with larger size. In situ analysis and mechanistic studies reveal the critical role of WO x sub‐nanoclusters in reducing the energy barriers of key steps in alanine synthesis. This work opens up new insights into the rational design of cluster catalysts to promote electrochemical amino acid synthesis.

The adsorption/desorption behavior of sulfur species at the (111) surfaces of pure Pt and various Pt-based bimetallic alloys, denoted as Pt3M (M = Co, Cu, Fe, Pd), was investigated by electrochemical measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After the adsorption of elemental sulfur, the current responses characteristic of the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen and hydroxyl species at the sulfur-free bare (111) surfaces completely disappeared, and a doublet peak corresponding to the elemental sulfur appeared in the S 2p region of XPS spectra. The characteristic current responses gradually recovered, simultaneously with the decrease of the S 2p peak, by repeating the potential cycling between −0.2 and 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl, indicating the oxidative desorption of S species. Except for the Pt3Pd(111) surface, in which Pd has a similar atomic radius to Pt and fully occupied 4d orbitals, the Pt3M(111) surfaces showed higher oxidative desorption capability than those of the pure Pt(111) surface; electrochemically active surface area recovered at the Pt3M(111) surfaces by fewer potential cycles than at the Pt(111) surface. Among the various factors, the downshift of the d-band center due to the ligand effect of foreign metal and the electronic interaction between adsorbed S and Pt are the dominant factors promoting the oxidative desorption of sulfur as well as the strain effect of foreign metal with an atomic radius smaller than Pt.

The relaxation of atomic positions to their optimal structural arrangement is crucial for understanding the emergence of new physical behavior in long scale superstructures in twisted bilayers of two-dimensional materials. The amount of deviation from a rigid moiré structure will depend on the elastic properties of the constituent monolayers which, for the twisted bilayer, the more flexible the monolayers are, the lower the energy required to deform the layers to maximize the areas with an energetically optimal interlayer arrangement of atoms. We investigate this atomic reconstruction for twisted bilayers of highly flexible InSe. Results using two methods are demonstrated: first we train a machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) to enable fully atomistic relaxations of small-twist-angle large-length-scale moiré supercells while retaining density functional theory (DFT) level accuracy. We find substantial out-of-plane corrugation and in-plane domain formation for a wide range of twist angles and moiré length scales. We then adapt an existing continuum approach and show that it can reproduce some, but not all, features of the fully atomistic calculations. Published by the American Physical Society 2025

Alloy nanoparticles based on platinum group metals (PGMs) have been intensively investigated in various fields, especially in catalysis. Recently, the scope of alloying has expanded to include not only d‐block transition metals but also p‐block elements, which have a wide range of properties that are very different from those of d‐block transition metals. By alloying PGMs with p‐block elements, the electronic structure and surface properties of the catalysts can be tuned, enhancing their catalytic performance. The focus of this review is on PGM–p‐block element nanoalloys, their synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and catalytic properties. In addition to typical binary crystalline alloys, such as solid‐solution and intermetallic alloys, this review also highlights the potential of multielement, amorphous, or liquid alloys, which have recently garnered much attention. The review aims to provide valuable perspectives for the development of PGM‐based sustainable and innovative catalysis, while also addressing the current challenges and future directions in this field.

Abstract Electrocatalysis advances rely on the development of efficient catalysts. Systematic material design hinges on identifying activity and selectivity descriptors. While adsorption energy descriptors have helped predict new materials, they are typically based on pure metals, uncertain of their applicability to complex materials like alloys. Here, we systematically analyze the validity of descriptor models for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). For this, we prepare gold, silver, and palladium alloys of variable composition and confirm experimentally the continuous variation of the d-band center (i.e. the CO adsorption energy) and work function (i.e. the potential of zero charge). Our results indicate that while the d-band center is the decisive factor for CO production, it, along with the work function, fails to fully explain the production of HCOO− and H2. Designing a copper-like alloy based on the matching of these descriptor values showed no formation of C2 products (as commonly expected for copper). This breakdown of the descriptor model is explained from first-principles calculations by the heterogeneity of the surface leading to different deactivation pathways for C2 product formation. Our results highlight the problems in transferring conventional descriptor models to more complex, heterogeneous materials motivating future developments.

Abstract Inducing magnetic ordering in a non‐ferrous layered double hydroxides (LDHs) instigates higher spin polarization, which leads to enhanced efficiency during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In nano‐sized magnetic materials, the concept of elongated grains drives domain alignment under the application of an external magnetic field. Hence, near the solid electrode interface, modified magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) positively impacts the electrocatalytic ability of non‐ferrous nanocatalysts. Consequently, significant improvement in the water‐splitting kinetics can be obtained by using even low magnetic fields. At 100 Gauss, 20% and 10% decrement in the overpotential is reported for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are also presented to explain the thermodynamics of the HER/OER processes. It is established that the Gibbs energy of the process can reduce the exchange energy barrier by using dopant like cobalt. The additional cobalt metal active site have the highest probability for adsorption of reactive intermediates during HER and OER, which results in higher efficiencies.
