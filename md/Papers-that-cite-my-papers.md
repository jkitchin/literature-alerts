Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) heavily depends on their substrates. However, heterojunctions with traditional substrate materials often fail to provide the desired dynamic interface effects. Here, through a systematic study of the ferroelectric heterostructure In 2 Se 3 /C‐N‐M, the feasibility of using ferroelectric materials to achieve dynamic optimization of the OER activity on SACs is demonstrated. The ferroelectric In 2 Se 3 is confirmed to be an effective substrate for improving the stability of various SACs, supported by theoretical results of their negative formation energy and positive dissolution potential. Activity analysis indicates that among these In 2 Se 3 /C‐N‐M systems, the In 2 Se 3 /C‐N‐Ir can achieve near‐ideal catalytic activities through polarization switching. It can unprecedentedly catalyze OER via a hybrid pathway of adsorbate evolution mechanism and O‐O coupling mechanism under different pH conditions (from pH = 1 to pH = 13). Machine learning models have been developed to conduct feature analysis and make ultrafast predictions of OER activity, which identify that the interfacial charge transfer triggered by ferroelectric polarization is the key to fine‐tuning the OER performance of SACs. This work provides a theoretical framework that utilizes ferroelectric polarization as a powerful approach to navigate the design of efficient SACs.

Developing highly active, low-cost, and durable catalysts for efficient oxygen reduction reactions remain a challenge, hindering the commercial viability of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this study, an ordered PtZnFeCoNiCr high-entropy intermetallic electrocatalyst with Pt antisite point defects (PD-PZFCNC-HEI) is synthesized. The electrocatalyst shows high mass activity of 4.12 A mgPt-1 toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is 33 times that of the commercial Pt/C. PEMFC, assembled with PD-PZFCNC-HEI as the cathode (0.05 mgPt cm-2), exhibits a peak power density of 1.9 W cm-2 and a high mass activity of 3.0 A mgPt-1 at 0.9 V. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ X-ray absorption fine structure results reveal that defect engineering optimizes Pt's electronic structure and activates non-noble metal site active centers, achieving exceptionally high ORR catalytic activity. This study provides guidance for the development of nanostructured ordered high-entropy intermetallic catalysts.

In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Materials Project and MoleculeNet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.

ZnAl2O4 spinel is widely used as a support in various reactions due to its thermal stability. Investigating the interaction between CO and ZnAl2O4 is essential for understanding the surface reaction mechanisms. In the present work, density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio atomistic thermodynamics were employed to investigate the adsorption of CO on perfect and O-defective ZnAl2O4 surfaces at varying CO coverages. The results reveal the formation of C* species and the subsequent aggregation can be hindered by the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy (Ovac) at low CO coverages. Notably, at high CO coverages, carbon deposition (CD) occurs on the ZnAl2O4 surfaces. ΔμCO is regulated below its threshold based on surface Ovac concentrations to control CO coverage and thereby suppress CD. At 523 K, the CO partial pressures should be maintained below 100, 10-3, 100, and 10-6 atm for surface with Ovac concentrations of 0, 12.5, 25, and 37.5%, respectively, to prevent CD on the surface. DFT-simulated IR spectra show that varying Ovac concentrations significantly affects the CO adsorption peak types and shifts, causing red shifts in vibrational frequencies for linearly adsorbed CO. These findings provide guidance for synthesizing ZnAl2O4 with varying Ovac concentrations to enhance catalyst efficiency and durability while mitigating CD.

Electron transfer is always the spotlight in electrochemistry, especially electrochemical energy storage. However, the current understanding of electron transfer, particularly in heterogeneous systems as explained by Marcus theory, faces challenges in accurately accounting for surface effects, solvent reorganization, and quantum tunneling, which are critical to real‐world applications. Here, this review presents a comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous electron transfer processes within the framework of Marcus theory, focusing on computing approaches using Python and Wolfram Language. The introduction outlines the significance of Marcus theory in explaining electron transfer reactions and sets the stage for the subsequent discussions. In the results and discussions section, the electron distribution in heterogeneous systems is explored, comparing the effects of different formalisms on electron transfer. A detailed comparison of the computational approaches using Python and Mathematica underscores the essential role of programing in tackling complex electron transfer models. These tools offer powerful, complementary capabilities for simulating the nuanced behavior of heterogeneous electron transfer processes, providing researchers with the flexibility and precision necessary to address the limitations of traditional theoretical methods. Finally, the work delves into the law of conservation of energy within the context of Marcus theory, offering a nuanced discussion of its implications for electron transfer studies. This review aims to equip researchers with practical insights and computing tools to enhance their understanding and application of Marcus theory in heterogeneous systems.

Two-dimensional carbon materials and their derivatives are widely applied as promising electrocatalysts and supports of single-atom sites. Theoretical investigations of 2D carbon materials are usually based on planar models, yet ignore local curvature brought on by possible surface distortion, which can be significant to the exact catalytic performance as has been realized in latest research. In this work, the curvature-influenced electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) reactivity of heme-like FeN4 single-atom site was predicted by a first-principle study, with FeN4-CNT(m,m) (m = 5~10) models adopted as local curvature models. The results showed that a larger local curvature is favored for NRR, with a lower limiting potential and higher N2 adsorption affinity, while a smaller local curvature shows lower NH3 desorption energy and is beneficial for catalyst recovery. Using electronic structures and logarithm fitting, we also found that FeN4-CNT(5,5) shows an intermediate-spin state, which is different from the high-spin state exhibited by other FeN4-CNT(m,m) (m = 6~10) models with a smaller local curvature.

A comprehensive understanding of the electrode-electrolyte interface in energy conversion systems remains challenging due to the complex and multifaceted nature of interfacial processes. This complexity hinders the development of more efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to the theoretical description of the OER process on nickel-iron-based oxyhydroxides (γ-Ni1-xFexOOH) electrodes in alkaline media as a model system. Multiple reaction pathways represented by the single- and dual-site mechanisms were investigated by taking into account the realistic structure of the catalyst, the doping, and the solvation effects using a simple and computationally feasible strategy. Accounting for the variable solvation effects considerably affects the predicted overpotential in a roughly linear relationship between overpotential and dielectric constant. By incorporating quantum chemical simulations with kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that tuning the local solvation environment can significantly enhance the OER activity, opening new routine ways for elucidation of the emerging issues of OER processes on transition metal oxide surfaces and design of cost-effective, efficient electrocatalytic systems.

Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to several energy technologies but suffers from low activity. Leveraging the lattice oxygen activation mechanism (LOM) is a strategy for boosting its activity. However, this approach faces significant thermodynamic challenges, requiring high-valent oxidation of metal ions without compromising their stability. We reveal that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can efficiently activate the LOM through synergistic multi-path electron transfer. Specifically, the oxidation of nickel is enhanced by this electron transfer, aided by the integration of weaker Co-O bonds, enabling effective LOM at the Ni-Co dual-site. These insights allow the design of a NiFeCoCrW0.2 HEA that exhibits improved activity, achieving an overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. It also demonstrates good stability, maintaining the potential with less than 5% variation over 90 days at 100 mA cm-2 current density. This study sheds light on the synergistic effects that confer high activity in HEAs and contribute to the advancement of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.

Biomass-based carbon materials are considered promising metal-free catalysts for the 2e- oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to synthesize H2O2 and act as air electrodes in Zn-air batteries. However, optimization of the catalyst structure is a complex process due to the diversity of biomass precursors and synthesis parameters. Machine learning, a new artificial intelligence technology, has recently been used in various fields owing to its ability to rapidly analyze large amounts of data and guide material synthesis. Consequently, we constructed a machine learning model based on previously reported experimental data and guided the fabrication of a boron-doped biomass carbon catalyst for the 2e- ORR. The achieved catalytic performance exceeded most reported ORR catalysts in terms of H2O2 selectivity (90-95% in broad potentials of 0.30-0.68 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), stability (maintaining over 90% selectivity for 12 h), yield (3450 mmol gcatalyst-1 h-1), and Faraday efficiency (over 90%). We applied the catalysts to Zn-air batteries and showed a high capacity (2856 mAh g-1) and stability twice that of traditional commercial metal catalysts. Therefore, this study proposed an effective machine learning model to guide the fabrication of biomass-based catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis.

The pivotal area of research in the quest for sustainable and efficient methods although highly effective for industrial ammonia production, is energy-intensive and reliant on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to global carbon emissions. NRR offers a promising alternative, enabling ammonia synthesis at ambient temperatures and pressures using renewable energy sources. This reaction, where nitrogen is converted into ammonia through electrochemical means, mitigate environmental demand for green technologies in chemical manufacturing. At the core of NRR is the challenge of nitrogen activation, as molecular Electrocatalysts play a crucial role in facilitating this reaction by lowering the energy barriers associated with nitrogen dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Various materials, including precious metals, transition metal compounds, and novel carbon-based nanostructures, have been explored for their catalytic properties.

Electrochemical hydrogenation, powered by renewable electricity, represents a promising sustainable approach for organic synthesis and the valorization of biomass-derived chemicals. Traditional strategies often rely on alkaline conditions to mitigate the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, posing challenges in sourcing hydrogen atoms for hydrogenation, which can be addressed through localized water dissociation on the electrode surface. In this study, we present a computationally guided design of electrochemical hydrogenation catalysts by optimizing hydrogen coverage density and binding strength on the electrode. Our theoretical investigations identify Cu, Au, and Ag - metals with moderate hydrogen coverage - as promising catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenations in alkaline media. These predictions are experimentally validated using a model organic substrate (acetophenone), achieving yields and faradaic efficiencies of up to 90%. Additionally, Cu, a nonprecious metal, is demonstrated to selectively hydrogenate a wide range of unsaturated compounds, including C═O, C═C, C≡C, and C≡N bonds, at low potentials with moderate to excellent conversion rates and chemoselectivities. This work highlights the potential of tailoring hydrogen coverage on electrode surfaces to rationally design nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for efficient organic hydrogenations. The insights gained here are expected to inform the development of more effective catalysts for organic hydrogenations and other industrially relevant chemical transformations.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has, in recent years, attracted great interest from scientists because of its prime role in a number of renewable energy technologies. It is one of the reactions that occurs during hydrogen production through water splitting, is used in rechargeable metal–air batteries, and plays a fundamental role in regenerative fuel cells. Therefore, there is an emerging need to develop new, active, stable, and cost-effective materials for OER. This review presents the latest research on various groups of materials, showing their potential to be used as OER electrocatalysts, as well as their shortcomings. Particular attention has been paid to metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives, as those materials offer coordinatively unsaturated sites, high density of transition metals, adjustable pore size, developed surface area, and the possibility to be modified and combined with other materials.

Abstract Pt nanoparticles dispersed on carbon supports (Pt/C) are the benchmark oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, their widespread application is hindered by severe stability degradation under high potentials and acidic environments, primarily due to carbon support corrosion. To address this challenge, a multiscale template‐assisted method is proposed, combined with ethylene glycol reduction, to fabricate Pt nanoparticles supported onto multiscale porous conductive antimony tin oxides (Pt/PT‐SSO). Both theoretical and experimental approaches have shown that the strong interaction between Pt and support markedly accelerates electron transfer and optimizes the adsorption strength of key intermediates on the Pt surface. Furthermore, the unique multiscale porous structure of support not only provides an ideal platform for the uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles but also greatly enhances confinement effect, effectively preventing Pt aggregation. As a result, the Pt/PT‐SSO exhibits superior ORR activity and durability compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Specifically, its mass activity at 0.9 V (vs RHE) reaches 0.617 A mgPt⁻¹, which is twice that of Pt/C, while maintaining outstanding stability over 50 h. Notably, PEMFCs utilizing Pt/PT‐SSO achieve a high power density of 1.173 W cm⁻ 2 and retain 94.9% after 30,000 cycles of accelerated durability testing.

This study presents a machine learning (ML)-augmented framework for accurately predicting excited-state properties critical to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. By integrating the computational efficiency of semi-empirical PPP+CIS theory with a Δ-ML approach, the model overcomes the inherent limitations of PPP+CIS in predicting key properties, including singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) energies, singlet–triplet gaps (ΔEST), and oscillator strength (f). The model demonstrated exceptional accuracy across datasets of varying sizes and diverse molecular features, notably excelling in predicting oscillator strength and ΔEST values, including negative regions relevant to TADF molecules with inverted S1–T1 gaps. This work highlights the synergy between physics-inspired models and machine learning in accelerating the design of efficient TADF emitters, providing a foundation for future studies on complex systems and advanced functional materials.

Abstract Molecular graphene provides an attractive man‐made artificial system to realize designer Dirac fermions with exotic properties and significant implications in electronics/spintronics, but its large‐scale fabrication remains a challenge as the available approach involves molecule‐by‐molecule manipulation of CO on a metal surface using a scanning tunneling microscopy tip. Here, we propose the epitaxial growth of molecular graphene on metal surface alloy, where CO molecules could be naturally self‐assembled into a hexagonal lattice. Via high‐throughput first‐principles calculations, the adsorption behaviors of CO on 30 surface alloys Cu 2 M (M represents the alloyed element) with a ()‐ R 30° superstructure on Cu(111) is explored. By systematically analyzing the structures, energetic and electronic properties of the adsorbed systems with different CO coverages, three surface alloys, Cu 2 Zn, Cu 2 Ga, and Cu 2 Ge, on which molecular graphene can be spontaneously formed, are successfully screened out. Remarkably, the self‐assembled molecular graphene is featured by an effective four‐band model involving the molecular (, ) orbitals of CO on a hexagonal lattice, leading to quantum spin Hall effect. This work paves an avenue for the large‐scale growth of artificial graphene, which should stimulate immediate interest among experimentalists in the synthesis, characterization, and implementation of topological states for dissipationless transport and quantum computing.

Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial data set creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.

We report the effects of reducing surface asperity size at the nanometer scale on metallic surfaces by plasma-assisted surface modification processes using simulations and experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted by irradiating various inert gas ions (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) onto a cobalt slab with nanoscale asperities on the surface. The MD simulations showed that as the atomic number of the inert gas increased the surface asperity size was reduced more efficiently, while the etching rate decreased. The dependencies of the scattering behaviors on the inert gas ions originated from the mass exchange between the working gas ions and the slab atoms. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray fluorescence measurements were performed on hard disk media subjected to the surface modification processes. These measurements experimentally demonstrated that the density of nanoscale asperities was reduced with a lower etching rate as the atomic number of the inert gas increased, consistent with the simulation results. Through this study, we clarified that heavier working gases were more effective in reducing surface asperity size without significantly reducing the thickness of the material, which can contribute to better control of surface morphologies at the nanometer scale.

Abstract Durable electrocatalysts and optimal ionomer distribution in cathode catalyst layer (CCL) are crucial for the efficiency and lifetime of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), especially at high currents. This work presents a 1D package‐integrated platinum (Pt) catalyst designed to optimize mass exchange and boost cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The package‐integrated Pt catalyst not only enhances the active site utilization, activity, and stability of Pt alloys but also optimizes the ionomer coverage and oxygen transport within the CCL. It shows superior performance with a mass activity of 1.33 A mg Pt −1 and only a 12 mV decay in half‐wave potential after 30 000 cycles. Additionally, it delivers impressive catalytic performance (320 mA cm −2 at 0.8 V), mass transport polarization (0.632 V at 2000 mA cm −2 ), and low oxygen transport resistance (0.03 s cm −1 ) in hydrogen‐air fuel cells. This package‐integrated catalyst with robust anti‐ionomer interference and impressive transport capability is of great significance for designing efficient and long‐lasting PEMFC cathodes.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have drawn public concern recently due to their toxic properties and persistence in the environment, making it urgent to eliminate PFAS from contaminated water. Electrochemical oxidation (EO) has shown great promise for the destructive treatment of PFAS with direct electron transfer and hydroxyl radical (⋅OH)-mediated indirect reactions. One of the most popular electrodes is Magnéli phase titanium suboxides. However, the degradation mechanisms of PFAS are still unsure and are under investigation now. The main methodology is the first-principal density functional theory (DFT) computation, which is recently used to explore the degradation mechanisms and interpret by-product formation during PFAS mineralization. From the literature review, the main applications of DFT computation for studying PFAS degradation mechanisms by EO include bond dissociation energy, absorption energy, activation energy, and overpotential η for oxygen evolution reactions. The main degradation mechanisms and pathways of PFAS in the EO process include mass transfer, direct electron transfer, decarboxylation, peroxyl radical generation, hydroxylation, intramolecular rearrangement, and hydrolysis. In the recent 4 years, 11 papers performed DFT computation to explore the possible PFAS degradation mechanisms and pathways in the EO process. This paper’s objectives are to: 1) summarize the main degradation mechanisms of PFAS degradation in EO; 2) review the application of DFT computation for studying PFAS degradation mechanisms during EO; process; 3) review the possible degradation pathways of perfluorooctane sulfonoic acid (PFOS) and per-fluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) during EO process.

This article introduces a suite of mini-applications (mini-apps) designed to optimise computational kernels in ab initio electronic structure codes. The suite is developed from flagship applications participating in the NOMAD Center of Excellence, such as the ELPA eigensolver library and the GW implementations of the exciting, Abinit, and FHI-aims codes. The mini-apps were identified by targeting functions that significantly contribute to the total execution time in the parent applications. This strategic selection allows for concentrated optimisation efforts. The suite is designed for easy deployment on various High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, supported by an integrated CMake build system for straightforward compilation and execution. The aim is to harness the capabilities of emerging (post)exascale systems, which necessitate concurrent hardware and software development — a concept known as co-design. The mini-app suite serves as a tool for profiling and benchmarking, providing insights that can guide both software optimisation and hardware design. Ultimately, these developments will enable more accurate and efficient simulations of novel materials, leveraging the full potential of exascale computing in material science research.

Abstract Low‐cost and durable hydrogen fuel cells are crucial for the success of the hydrogen economy. While Fe–N–C catalysts are amongst the most promising low‐cost alternative to platinum (Pt) for the oxygen reduction reaction, their unsatisfactory durability is the grand challenge faced by the field due to iron demetallation, carbon corrosion and electrode collapse. Herein, a dual‐metal single‐atom Fe–Mn–N–C catalyst with superior stability (49% loss in peak power density) than Fe–N–C catalysts (66% loss) over 96 h of continuous operations in H 2 –O 2 fuel cells is reported. Advanced operando electrochemical and post‐mortem physical measurements shed light on the underlying mechanism. The iron–manganese bond anchors the iron strongly in the Fe–Mn–N–C centre, which lowers the hydrogen peroxide yield as a result. Operando electrochemical measurements reveal a more stable triple‐phase boundary environment for the Fe–Mn–N–C catalyst than for Fe–N–C. Specifically, a combination of cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy with the distribution of relaxation times reveals that the iron demetallation and carbon corrosion are respectively 20% and 30% slower for the Fe–Mn–N–C catalyst than the Fe–N–C catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells. Altogether, this dual‐metal site strategy paves the way for improving the stability of Pt‐free catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells.

Within the context of green chemistry, the concept of green carbon science emphasizes carbon balance and recycling to address the challenge of achieving carbon neutrality. The fundamental processes in this field are oxidation and reduction, which often involve simple molecules such as CO2, CO, CH4, CHx, and H2O. Water plays a critical role in nearly all oxidation-reduction processes, and thus, it is a central focus of research in green carbon science. Water can act as a direct source of dihydrogen in reduction reactions or participate in oxidation reactions, frequently involving O-O coupling to produce hydrogen peroxide or dioxygen. At the atomic level, this coupling involves the statistically unfavorable proximity of two atoms, requiring optimization through a catalytic process influenced by two types of factors, as described by the authors. Extrinsic factors are related to geometrical and electronic criteria associated with the catalytic metal, involving its d-orbitals (or bands in the case of zerovalent metals and electrodes). Intrinsic factors are related to the coupling of oxygen atoms via their p-orbitals. At the mesoscopic or microscopic scale, the reaction medium typically consists of mixtures of lipophilic and hydrophilic phases with water, which may exist under supercritical conditions or as suspensions of microdroplets. These reactions predominantly occur at phase interfaces. A comprehensive understanding of the phenomena across these scales could facilitate improvements and even lead to the development of novel conversion processes.

Controlling the electron spin of oxygen-containing intermediates is crucial for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis toward clean energy technologies such as fuel cells and water electrolysis. Current strategies for controlling the electron spins rely mainly on tuning the chemical structure of the oxygen electrocatalyst, which is often hardly achieved for metal and oxide electrocatalysts. The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, a significant discovery in chiral spintronics, represents an alternative approach for tuning the spin selectivity of oxygen electrocatalysts. Here we demonstrate the use of intrinsic chiral nanoparticles as electron-spin filters to tune the selectivity in oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Chiral Au nanoparticles with a concave vortex cube structure were employed as the chiral substrate, exhibiting highly tunable optical chirality and intriguing CISS-like effect. As model systems, the catalytically active components such as Pt or Ni(OH)2 are overgrown onto chiral Au nanoparticles to construct the chiral hybrid electrocatalysts. Remarkably, both cases show chirality-dependent tunable activities over oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, respectively. The insights gained from this work not only shed light on the underlying mechanisms dictating the CISS-enhanced oxygen electrocatalysis by chiral nanoparticles but also provide an important knowledge framework that guides the rational design of chiral electrocatalysts toward oxygen electrocatalysis.

The scarcity of iridium (Ir) limits its widespread use in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, mesoporous single-crystalline spinel Co3O4 with atomically dispersed low-valence-state Ir has been developed to enable Ir's efficient and stable utilization. The surface Pourbaix diagram suggests that under acidic OER conditions, O* fully covers both Co3O4(111) and (110) surfaces, passivating Co sites but enhancing Co3O4's structural stability, a benefit further improved by Ir doping. Mesopores offer numerous loading sites for Ir single atoms (13.8 wt %), which activate the originally O*-passivated Co3O4(111) surface by creating high-intrinsic-activity Co-Ir bridge sites; meanwhile, Ir and Co leaching rates are reduced to about 1/4 and 1/5, respectively, compared to conventional Ir/Co3O4 catalysts. Our catalyst exhibits a low η10 of 248 mV for over 100 h, showcasing its potential in water electrolysis.
