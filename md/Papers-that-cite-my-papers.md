Understanding active phases across interfaces, interphases, and even within the bulk under varying external conditions and environmental species is critical for advancing heterogeneous catalysis. Describing these phases through computational models faces the challenges in the generation and calculation of a vast array of atomic configurations. Here, we present a framework for the automatic and efficient exploration of active phases. This approach utilizes a topology-based algorithm leveraging persistent homology to systematically sample configurations across diverse coordination environments and material morphologies. Simultaneously, efficient machine learning force fields enable rapid computations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in two systems: hydrogen absorption in Pd, where hydrogen penetrates subsurface layers and the bulk, inducing a "hex" reconstruction critical for CO2 electroreduction, explored through 50,000 sampled configurations; and the oxidation dynamics of Pt clusters, where oxygen incorporation renders the clusters less active during oxygen reduction reactions, investigated through 100,000 sampled configurations. In both cases, the predicted active phases and their impacts on catalytic mechanisms closely align with previous experimental observations, indicating that the proposed strategy can model complex catalytic systems and discovery active phases under specific environmental conditions. Discovering active phases in heterocatalysis entails efficient configuration sampling and optimization. Here, the authors developed a framework based on topology and machine learning to effectively explore the active structures, applied in the CO2 electroreduction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized catalysis research with their efficiency and accuracy in modeling complex chemical interactions. However, adapting GNNs trained on nonaqueous data sets to aqueous systems poses notable challenges due to intricate water interactions. In this study, we proposed an active learning-based fine-tuning approach to extend the applicability of GNNs to aqueous environments. The geometry optimization and transition state search workflows are designed to reduce computational costs while maintaining DFT-level accuracy. Applied to the CO2 reduction reaction, the workflow delivers a 2-3-fold acceleration in geometry optimization through a relaxed force threshold combined with DFT refinement. The versatility of the transition state search algorithm was demonstrated on key C-C coupling pathways, pinpointing *CO-*COH as the most energetically favorable pathway in aqueous systems of Cu and Cu-based Ag, Au, and Zn alloys. The Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationship remains robust under water-induced fluctuations, with alloyed metals such as Al, Ga, and Pd, along with Ag, Au, and Zn, exhibiting coupling efficiency comparable to that of Cu. Additionally, perturbation-based training on forces and energies extends the application of GNNs to aqueous ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, enabling efficient modeling of dynamical trajectories. This work presents novel approaches to adapting nonaqueous models for application in aqueous systems, highlighting GNNs' potential in solvated environments and laying a foundation for accelerating predictions of catalytic mechanisms under realistic conditions.

Abstract Heterogeneous single-atom systems demonstrate potential to break performance limitations of single-atom catalysts through synergy interactions. The synergy in heterogeneous single atoms strongly dependes on their anchoring sites. Herein, we reveal the site-specific synergy in heterogeneous single atoms for oxygen evolution. The Ru T Ir V /CoOOH is fabricated by anchoring Ru single atoms onto three-fold facial center cubic hollow sites and Ir single atoms onto oxygen vacancy sites on CoOOH. Moreover, Ir T Ru V /CoOOH is also prepared by switching the anchoring sites of single atoms. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate the Ru T Ir V /CoOOH exhibits enhanced OER performance compared to Ir T Ru V /CoOOH. In-situ spectroscopic and mechanistic studies indicate that Ru single atoms at three-fold facial center cubic hollow sites serve as adsorption sites for key reaction intermediates, while Ir single atoms at oxygen vacancy sites stabilize the *OOH intermediates via hydrogen bonding interactions. This work discloses the correlation between the synergy in heterogeneous single atoms and their anchoring sites.

Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is not only an important fundamental process in energy systems but also a pivotal factor in enhancing electrocatalytic functions in fuel cells (FCs). This article investigates the PCET mechanism in low-temperature (300–500 °C) protonic ceramic fuel cells, focusing on its role in catalyzing the hydrogen oxidation reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction. Our findings reveal that PCET significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity by mitigating polarization losses, reducing charge-transfer resistance by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, and thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics compared to scenarios without PCET. Importantly, changes in relaxation time upon proton injection evidence the robustness of PCET. The marked reduction in activation energy to 0.31 eV further illustrates how PCET overcomes energy barriers, facilitating more efficient reaction pathways. These insights highlight the critical role of PCET in optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of FCs, underscoring its significant importance in advancing FC technology.

Surfaces and interfaces play key roles in chemical and material science. Understanding physical and chemical processes at complex surfaces and interfaces is a challenging task. Machine learning provides a powerful tool to help analyze and accelerate simulations. This comprehensive review affords an overview of the applications of machine learning in the study of surfaces and interfaces of chemical systems and materials. We categorize surfaces and interfaces into the following broad categories: solid–solid interface, solid–liquid interface, liquid–liquid interface, surface of solid, surface of liquid, and three-phase interfaces. High-throughput screening, combined machine learning and first-principles calculations, and machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamics simulations are used to rational design and study physical and chemical processes of surfaces and interfaces in systems such as all-solid-state batteries, solar cells, and heterogeneous catalysis. This review provides detailed and comprehensive information on the applications of machine learning on surfaces and interfaces for chemical and material science.

This work focuses on the impact of lateral interactions on the thermophysical properties of adsorbates. We present different parametrizations for coverage-dependent enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity in a mean-field microkinetic model. These models are tested against two systems, CO/Pt(111) and CO/Co(0001), using two different functionals. A detailed investigation into how coverage influences the thermophysical properties of CO* is presented. We place particular emphasis on studying the impact of coverage on the vibrational partition function and how this affects the entropy of adsorbates. Higher coverages typically lead to increased repulsive interactions, which should further constrain the large amplitude modes that contribute the most to the vibrational entropy. In some cases, however, the opposite effect occurred; the vibrational entropy actually increased because surface crowding forced adsorbates to different binding locations that had lower frequencies. Our results highlighted cases where coverage-dependent entropy should be included, such as for adsorbates with lateral vibrational modes and systems at high temperatures. These methods for including coverage-dependent properties into mean-field microkinetics in a thermodynamically consistent way are now available in the open-source software Cantera.

Abstract The commercial utilization of low‐dimensional catalysts has been hindered by their propensity for agglomeration and stacking, greatly minimizing their utilization of active sites. To circumvent this problem, low‐dimensional materials can be assembled into systematic 3D architectures to synergistically retain the benefits of their constituent low‐dimensional nanomaterials, with value‐added bulk properties such as increased active surface area, improved charge transport pathways, and enhanced mass transfer, leading to higher catalytic activity and durability compared to their constituents. The hierarchical organization of low‐dimensional building blocks within 3D structures also enables precise control over the catalyst's morphology, composition, and surface chemistry, facilitating tailored design for specific electrochemical applications. Despite the surge in 3D metal‐based assemblies, there are no reviews encompassing the different types of metal‐based 3D assemblies from low‐dimensional nanomaterials for electrocatalysis. Herein, this review addresses this gap by investigating the various types of self‐supported 3D assemblies and exploring how their electrocatalytic performance can be elevated through structural modifications and mechanistic studies to tailor them for various electrochemical reactions.

Abstract To enhance the lifetime of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, developing highly durable platinum‐based cathode catalysts is essential. While two degradation pathways for the cathode catalyst—carbon corrosion and electrocatalyst (platinum nanoparticles) coarsening—have been identified, current approaches to enhance its durability are limited to addressing individual degradation pathways. Herein, the study develops a core/shell‐structured carbon support that is designed to afford cathode catalysts capable of simultaneously inhibiting carbon corrosion and electrocatalyst coarsening. The core/shell structure is distinguished by its bifunctional nature: the core is made of highly graphitized carbon tailored to build a robust carbon skeleton, and the shell comprises heteroatom‐doped amorphous carbon engineered to prevent electrocatalyst coarsening by chemical/physical anchoring of platinum nanoparticles. Thanks to this elaborate design, the catalyst surpasses the durability targets for carbon supports and electrocatalysts set by the U.S. Department of Energy, as supported by the achieved durability metrics after the square‐wave/triangle‐wave accelerated stress tests: electrochemical surface area loss at 13%/3%, mass activity loss at 27%/17%, and voltage loss of 29 mV (at 0.8 A cm − 2 )/4 mV (at 1.5 A cm − 2 ).

Although hierarchical porous carbon materials have been widely used for electrocatalysis, the role of curvature in carbon nanostructures during electrochemical reactions remains poorly understood due to a lack of experimental models featuring clearly defined curved geometries and periodic structures. In this study, we fabricate hierarchical porous cobalt- and nitrogen-containing carbon nanoplates with trimodal porosity (macro-, meso-, and micropores) and continuous, homogeneous curved edges (Co/N-CNP-CURV) using a polystyrene-directed templating approach. The Co/N-CNP-CURV catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for the alkaline oxygen reduction reaction, with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V and a minimal potential shift of 8 mV after 5000 cycles. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity is attributed to synergistic combinations of the trimodal porosity, abundant Co-Nx active sites, a high density of curved edges, and graphitic carbon encapsulated with cobalt nanoparticles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of curvature in Co/N-CNP-CURV is beneficial for enhancing the charge transfer from the catalyst to O2, lowering the adsorption energy of O2, and reducing the activation free energy barrier for the rate-determining step (*O2 + (H+ + e-) → *OOH). The study provides compelling experimental evidence supporting the critical role of the curvature effect in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of nanoporous metal-containing carbon materials.

Abstract Indium‐zirconium (InZrO x ) and zinc‐zirconium oxides (ZnZrO x ) have emerged as highly selective and stable catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol, a versatile energy carrier. However, the disparity in synthesis methods, catalyst formulations, and structures previously studied precludes quantitative comparisons between the two families. Herein, a rigorous framework is pioneered to benchmark InZrO x and ZnZrO x materials prepared by a standardized flame spray pyrolysis synthesis platform, enabling consistently high surface areas and tunable metal speciation ranging from isolated atoms (<5 mol%) to predominantly nanoparticles (>10 mol%). Isolated indium and zinc species are commonly identified to be optimal for activity and methanol selectivity in their respective families, maximizing CO 2 and H 2 activation abilities. InZrO x outperforms ZnZrO x across speciations and is less structure sensitive, as deviations from atomic dispersion is less detrimental on performance for the former. Focusing on representative catalysts featuring saturation of isolated species, the higher activity of 5 mol% InZrO x over its ZnZrO x counterpart is linked to differences in surface oxygen vacancy chemistry, a lower degree of product inhibition, and more facile hydrogenation of the formate intermediate to methoxy. The identification of reactivity descriptors governing both families facilitates the development of unified guidelines in designing reducible oxide catalysts.

Interatomic potentials are essential for driving molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, directly impacting the reliability of predictions regarding the physical and chemical properties of materials. In recent years, machine-learned potentials (MLPs), trained against first-principles calculations, have become a new paradigm in materials modeling as they provide a desirable balance between accuracy and computational cost. The neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach, implemented in the open-source GPUMD software, has emerged as a promising machine-learned potential, exhibiting impressive accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency. This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the methodological and practical aspects of the NEP approach, along with a detailed comparison with other representative state-of-the-art MLP approaches in terms of training accuracy, property prediction, and computational efficiency. We also demonstrate the application of the NEP approach to perform accurate and efficient MD simulations, addressing complex challenges that traditional force fields typically cannot tackle. Key examples include structural properties of liquid and amorphous materials, chemical order in complex alloy systems, phase transitions, surface reconstruction, material growth, primary radiation damage, fracture in two-dimensional materials, nanoscale tribology, and mechanical behavior of compositionally complex alloys under various mechanical loadings. This review concludes with a summary and perspectives on future extensions to further advance this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract The escalating global prevalence of allergies presents a substantial public health challenge. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) serves as a key biomarker for allergic diseases, often measured in blood serum by ELISA immunoassays. Despite recent interest in minimally invasive sampling of biological fluids, the low sample volumes and IgE concentrations demand highly sensitive methodologies, typically confined to centralized laboratories. In this article, a decentralizable approach based on competitive immunoassays using Pd nanocluster (PdNCs)-labelled antibodies for electrochemical detection is proposed. With this aim, PdNCs were successfully bioconjugated with an anti-hIgE antibody to perform competitive immunoassays. To improve the analytical capabilities of the methodology, disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes with dual working electrodes were used for enhancing precision. Prior electrodeposition of PdNCs at − 0.6 V for 90 s significantly improved sensitivity (7.1 µA g ng⁻ 1 ) and lowered the limit of detection (LoD) to 0.3 ng g⁻ 1 for PdNCs determination. The use of PdNCs as labels resulted in an improvement in the LoD for IgE determination. Calibration curves performed using competitive immunoassays for IgE determination, ranging from 10 −5 to 10 2 ng g −1 , demonstrated sensitivity comparable to high-tech methods, with a LoD of 0.008 ng g −1 for electrochemical measurements. Bimodal detection of Pd (linear sweep voltammetry and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry) in various biological fluids (saliva, tears, nasal exudate, capillary blood, and blood serum) revealed significant differences in IgE levels between allergic and non-allergic individuals. Notably, capillary blood correlated strongly with serum blood, and a certain correlation has also been found with nasal exudate. The electrochemical approach, combining sensitivity and precision with non-invasive sampling, offers a simplified alternative for IgE determination in allergic disease. Graphical Abstract

ABSTRACT Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered interest in designing their ligand environments, facilitating the modification of single catalytic sites toward high activity and selectivity. Despite various synthetic approaches, it remains challenging to achieve a catalytically favorable coordination structure simultaneously with the feasible formation of SACs at low temperatures. Here, a new type of coordination structure for Pt SACs is introduced to offer a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, where Pt SACs are readily fabricated by atomically confining PtCl 2 on chemically driven NO 2 sites in two‐dimensional nitrogen‐doped carbon nanosheets at room temperature. The resultant Pt SACs form the NO 2 –Pt–Cl 2 coordination structure with an atomic dispersion, as revealed by X‐ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy investigations. Moreover, our first‐principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations show strong interactions in the coordination by computing the binding energy and charge density difference between PtCl 2 and NO 2 . Pt SACs, established on the NO 2 ‐functionalized carbon support, demonstrate the onset potential of 25 mV, Tafel slope of 40 mV dec −1 , and high specific activity of 1.35 A mg Pt −1 . Importantly, the Pt SACs also exhibit long‐term stability up to 110 h, which is a significant advance in the field of single‐atom Pt catalysts. The newly developed coordination structure of Pt SACs features a single Pt active center, providing hydrogen binding ability comparable to that of Pt(111), enhanced long‐term durability due to strong metal‐support interactions, and the advantage of room‐temperature fabrication.

This study introduces correlated flat-bottom elastic network model (CFB-ENM), an extension of our recently developed flat-bottom elastic network model (FB-ENM) for generating plausible reaction paths, i.e., collision-free paths preserving nonreactive parts. While FB-ENM improved upon the widely used image-dependent pair potential (IDPP) by addressing unintended structural distortion and bond breaking, it still struggled with regulating the timing of series of bond breaking and formation. CFB-ENM overcomes this limitation by incorporating structure-based correlation terms. These terms impose constraints on pairs of atom pairs, ensuring immediate formation of new bonds after breaking of existing bonds. Using the direct MaxFlux method, we generated paths for 121 reactions involving main group elements and 35 reactions involving transition metals. We found that CFB-ENM significantly improves reaction paths compared to FB-ENM. CFB-ENM paths exhibited lower maximum DFT energies along the paths in most reactions, with nearly half showing significant energy reductions of several tens of kcal/mol. In the few cases where CFB-ENM yielded higher energy paths, most increases were below 10 kcal/mol. We also confirmed that CFB-ENM reduces computational costs in subsequent precise reaction path or transition state searches compared to FB-ENM. An implementation of CFB-ENM based on the Atomic Simulation Environment is available on GitHub for use in computational chemistry research.

The thickness of 2D materials not only plays a crucial role in determining the performance of nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices but also introduces complexities in predicting volume-dependent properties, such as energy storage capacity, due to the intrinsic vacuum within these materials. Although a plethora of experimental techniques, including but not limited to optical contrast, Raman spectroscopy, nonlinear optical spectroscopy, near-field optical imaging, and hyperspectral imaging, facilitate the measurement of 2D material thickness, comprehensive data for many materials remain elusive. Over the past decade, the exponential proliferation of 2D materials and their heterostructures has outstripped the capabilities of conventional experimental and computational approaches. In this evolving landscape, machine learning (ML) has emerged as an indispensable tool, offering a scalable approach to augment these traditional methodologies. Addressing the critical gap, we introduce THICK2D—Thickness Hierarchy Inference and Calculation Kit for 2D Materials. This Python-based computational framework harnesses an autogenerated thickness database, developed using large language models, and advanced ML algorithms to facilitate the rapid and scalable estimation of material thickness, relying solely on crystallographic data. To demonstrate the utility and robustness of THICK2D, we successfully used the toolkit to predict the thickness of more than 8000 2D-based materials, sourced from two extensive 2D materials databases. THICK2D is disseminated as an open-source utility, accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/gmp007/THICK2D, and archived on Zenodo at https://10.5281/zenodo.11216648.

Given the promising potential of these catalysts, an in-depth understanding of the relationship between their catalytic properties and activity is essential for enabling rational catalyst design. This review outlines fundamental OER mechanisms, followed by a discussion of design principles for multi-metal catalysts, focusing on activity descriptors and dynamic surface reconstruction. Recent advancements in multi-metal catalysts are evaluated, highlighting innovative strategies and breakthroughs. Lastly, the review addresses remaining challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for deeper insights into synergistic interactions among catalyst components and the development of catalysts to meet practical-scale performance demands.

Abstract Reducing platinum (Pt) usage and enhancing its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are vital for advancing fuel cell technology. This study presents the design and investigation of monolayer and few‐layer Pt structures with high platinum utilization, developed through theoretical calculations. By minimizing the metal thickness from 1 to 3 atomic layers, an atomic utilization rate ranging from 66.66% to 100% is achieved, in contrast to conventional multilayer Pt structures. This reduction resulted in a unique surface coordination environment. These thinner structures exhibited nonlinear fluctuations in key electronic characteristics—such as the d‐band center, surface charge, and work function—as the atomic layer thickness decreased. These variations significantly impacted species adsorption and the Pt‐H 2 O interfacial structure, which in turn affected the catalytic activity. Notably, 1‐layer Pt exhibited the best performance for HOR, while 3‐layer Pt showed high activity for both HOR and ORR. The findings establish a clear relationship between atomic layer thickness, surface characteristics, adsorption behavior, electric double‐layer structure, and catalytic performance in Pt systems. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of precision atomic‐structured electrocatalyst design and paves the way for the development of highly effective, low‐loading Pt‐based catalytic materials.

Abstract Introducing secondary heteroatoms and simultaneous in situ surface modification can enhance electrocatalysts by affecting their porosity for adjusting electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), number of active sites, and electronic properties, thus mitigating the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Here, mesoporous 3D heterostructures of boron‐doped cobalt phosphide@nitrogen‐doped carbon nanosheet network arrays are successfully grown on Ni foam as free‐standing bifunctional electrocatalysts with controlled phosphorous levels (B‐CoP x @NC/NF, x = 0.25, 0.5, and 1). Boron doping induces the Co active sites to bind O* and OOH* intermediates. Meanwhile, an optimal phosphorous content also leads to ideal adsorption strength at each reaction step, satisfying the Sabatier principle well. The optimal B‐CoP 0.5 @NC/NF requires low overpotentials of 248 mV for OER and 95 mV for HER with long‐term stability. The B‐CoP 0.5 @NC/NF (+/−) electrolyzer exhibits a low cell potential of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm −2 for overall water‐splitting, with superior activity compared to the RuO 2 /NF(+)//20%Pt/NF(−) electrolyzer at high current densities above 50 mA cm −2 . Such exceptional bifunctional activities are attributed to the modulated electronic structure, lower charge‐transfer resistance, higher ECSA, and inductive effect of B‐doping, thus boosting both OER and HER activities in alkaline media.

Among the reported non-precious-metal catalysts, metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts have emerged as a research cornerstone in the field of electrocatalysis, showcasing unparalleled activity in oxygen reduction reactions that rivals or even exceeds that of commercial Pt catalysts. Despite boasting high atom utilization and adjustable effective activity centers, M-N-C catalysts suffer from inadequate long-term stability under high-pressure and harshly acidic conditions within proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This drawback poses a significant challenge that critically limits their potential for widespread applications. From this perspective, we commence by delineating the pivotal strategies to augment the performance of M-N-C catalysts at the microscopic level, including the tuning of the intrinsic activity of individual active sites and the manipulation of their quantity. Furthermore, we delve into the benefits derived from the synergistic effects unleashed by the incorporation of multi-component active sites. At the mesoscopic level, this perspective engages with the design principles aimed at enhancing the activity and stability of M-N-C catalysts within the intricate three-phase boundary of PEMFCs. Ultimately, we prospect the opportunities and challenges facing the future evolution of M-N-C catalysts, with the aim of offering comprehensive guidance for the design and advancement of highly stable M-N-C catalysts tailored for PEMFC applications.

Abstract Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu‐based single‐atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu‐based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive d ‐ p orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu‐based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction‐acidic CO 2 electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single‐carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb 1 Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 ± 2.5% at 200 mA cm −2 . This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu‐based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh‐performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.
