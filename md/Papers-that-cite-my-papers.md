Abstract The path to searching for sustainable energy has never stopped since the depletion of fossil fuels can lead to serious environmental pollution and energy shortages. Using water electrolysis to produce hydrogen has been proven to be a prioritized approach for green resource production. It is highly crucial to explore inexpensive and high‐performance electrocatalysts for accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and apply them to industrial cases on a large scale. Here, we summarize the different mechanisms of HER in different pH settings and review recent advances in non‐noble‐metal‐based electrocatalysts. Then, based on the previous efforts, we discuss several universal strategies for designing pH‐independent catalysts and show directions for the future design of pH‐universal catalysts.

Abstract The impact of alkaline media on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate and selectivity is crucial for advancement of water electrolysis technology. Herein, we revealed the mechanism through which alkali metal cations (AM+) influence HER performance of Pt electrodes. We quantified the interfacial potential drops, which are regulatable by E-field and found that the local surface concentration of AM+ is 5.0 ~ 8.6 times higher than in the bulk solution. Decreasing AM+ concentration through reverse E-field disrupts adsorbate-surface interactions and boosts HER activity without affecting hydrogen binding energetics and kinetics. Complexes of OHδ−-(H2O)x-AM+ are formed near the interface, impacting intermediate product detachment. The presence of AM+ also plays a role in restructuring interfacial water and improving proton transfer efficiency. For Li+, the reorientation of O-H bonds towards Pt surface facilitates the HER process. These findings shed light on potential avenues for enhancing the efficiency of HER processes.

Abstract The synthesis of cone‐shaped Pt nanoparticles featuring compressively‐strained {111} facets by depositing Pt atoms on the vertices of Pd icosahedral nanocrystals, followed by selective removal of the Pd template via wet etching, is reported. By controlling the lateral dimensions down to ca. 3 nm, together with a thickness of ca. 2 nm, the Pt cones show greatly enhanced specific and mass activities toward oxygen reduction, with values being 2.8 and 6.4 times those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Both the strain field and the observed activity trend are rationalized using density functional theory calculations. With the formation of ultrathin linkers among the Pt cones derived from the same Pd icosahedral seed, the interconnected Pt cones acquire stronger interactions with the carbon support, preventing them from detachment and aggregation during the catalytic reaction. Even after 20 000 cycles of accelerated durability test, the Pt cones still show a mass activity 5.3 times higher than the initial value of the Pt/C.

Magnetic property (e.g. spin order) of support is of great importance in the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we have taken the Ni-supported ferromagnetic (FM) CrBr3 support (Nix/CrBr3) to thoroughly investigate the effect of spin-order on electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. Specifically, Ni loading induces anti-FM coupling in Ni-Cr, leading to a transition from FM-to-ferrimagnetic (FIM) properties, while Ni-Ni metallic bonds create a robust FM direct exchange, benefiting the improvement of the phase transition temperature. Interestingly, with the increase in Ni loading, the easy magnetic axis changes from out-of-plane (2D-Heisenberg) to in-plane (2D-XY). The adsorption properties of Nix/CrBr3, involving O2 adsorption energy and configuration, are not governed by the d-band center but strongly correlate with magnetic anisotropy. It is noteworthy that the applied potential and electrolyte acidity triggers spin-order transition phenomena during the ORR and induces the catalytic pathway change from 4e- ORR to 2e- ORR with the excellent onset potential of 0.93 V/reversible hydrogen electrode, comparable to the existing most excellent noble-metal catalysts. Generally, these findings offer new avenues to understand and design heterogeneous catalysts with magnetic support.

Abstract Proton exchange‐membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a clean and efficient type of energy storage device. However, the sluggish reaction rate of the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been a significant problem in its development. This review reports the recent progress of advanced electrocatalysts focusing on the interface/surface electronic structure and exploring the synergistic relationship of precious‐based and non‐precious metal‐based catalysts and support materials. The support materials contain non‐metal (C/N/Si, etc.) and metal‐based structures, which have demonstrated a crucial role in the synergistic enhancement of electrocatalytic properties, especially for high‐temperature fuel cell systems. To improve the strong interaction, some exciting synergistic strategies by doping and coating heterogeneous elements or connecting polymeric ligands containing carbon and nitrogen were also shown herein. Besides the typical role of the crystal surface, phase structure, lattice strain, etc., the evolution of structure‐performance relations was also highlighted in real‐time tests. The advanced in situ characterization techniques were also reviewed to emphasize the accurate structure‐performance relations. Finally, the challenge and prospect for developing the ORR electrocatalysts were concluded for commercial applications in low‐ and high‐temperature fuel cell systems.

Compared to conventional monoethanolamine (MEA), alternative solvents are expected to substantially contribute to reduce the energy demand of post-combustion CO 2 capture from flue gases. This study presents a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a 27 wt% 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) + 13 wt% piperazine (PZ) aqueous solution for CO 2 capture, compared to a 30 wt% MEA solution. The study addresses the retrofit of a carbon capture unit to a biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant, effectively making it a bioenergy with a carbon capture and storage (BECCS) system. The treated flue gas has a flow rate of 23 tons/hour (t/h) with 11.54 vol% CO 2 and a 90% capture rate is aimed for. Aspen Plus V14 was employed for process simulations. Initially, binary interaction parameters for AMP/PZ, AMP/H 2 O, and PZ/H 2 O are regressed using vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data, which were retrieved from literature along with reaction kinetics. Validation of parameters from available experimental literature yields an average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of only 5.9%. Afterwards, a process simulation model is developed and validated against experimental data from a reference pilot plant, using a similar AMP/PZ blend, resulting in 5% AARD. Next, a sensitivity analysis optimizes operating conditions, including solvent rate, absorber/stripper packing heights, and stripper pressure, based on regeneration energy impact. Optimized results, compared to MEA, reveal that AMP/PZ reduces the energy consumption from 3.61 to 2.86 GJ/tCO 2 . The retrofitting of the capture unit onto the selected CHP plant is examined through the development of a dedicated model. Two control strategies are compared to address energy unavailability for supplying the capture unit. The analysis spans 4 months, selected to account for seasonal variations. At nominal capacity, CO 2 emissions, rendered negative by biomass combustion and CO 2 capture, reach a maximum of −3.4 tCO 2 /h compared to 0.36 tCO 2 /h before retrofitting. Depending on the control strategy and CHP plant operating point, the Specific Primary Energy Consumption for CO 2 Avoided (SPECCA) ranges from 4.91 MJ/kgCO 2 to 1.76 MJ/kgCO 2 . Finally, an economic comparison based on systematic methodology reveals a 7.87% reduction in capture cost favoring the AMP/PZ blend. Together, these findings highlight AMP/PZ as a highly favorable alternative solvent.

Abstract Addressing sustainable energy storage remains crucial for transitioning to renewable sources. While Li‐ion batteries have made significant contributions, enhancing their capacity through alternative materials remains a key challenge. Micro‐sized silicon is a promising anode material due to its tenfold higher theoretical capacity compared to conventional graphite. However, its substantial volumetric expansion during cycling impedes practical application due to mechanical failure and rapid capacity fading. A novel approach is proposed to mitigate this issue by incorporating trace amounts of aluminum into the micro‐sized silicon electrode using ball milling. Density functional theory (DFT) is employed to establish a theoretical framework elucidating how grain boundary sliding, a key mechanism involved in preventing mechanical failure is facilitated by the presence of trace aluminum at grain boundaries. This, in turn, reduces stress accumulation within the material, reducing the likelihood of failure. To validate the theoretical predictions, capacity retention experiments are conducted on undoped and Al‐doped micro‐sized silicon samples. The results demonstrate significantly reduced capacity fading in the doped sample, corroborating the theoretical framework and showcasing the potential of aluminum doping for improved Li‐ion battery performance.

Abstract Electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems (EESCSs), including batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and water electrolysis technologies, enabling the direct conversion between chemical and electrical energies. They are key to the flexible storage and utilization of renewable energy and play an important role in future energy technologies. The physical and chemical properties of electrode materials significantly influence the performance of EESCSs, necessitating the development of materials with both high cost‐effectiveness and superior electrochemical storage and catalytic capabilities. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), due to their unique properties as high surface area, evenly distributed active sites, and tunable compositions, makes themselves and the derivatives have become focal points in the EESCSs. This review summarizes recent advances of LDH and their derivates for diverse EESCSs applications, aims to elucidate the modification strategies of LDH materials and provide valuable insights for exploring LDH‐derived materials in various electrochemical devices, offering interdisciplinary perspectives for the rational design of LDH‐based materials.

Abstract C − H bond activation is a ubiquitous reaction that remains a major challenge in chemistry. Although semiconductor-based photocatalysis is promising, the C − H bond activation mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we report value-added coupling products from a wide variety of biomass and fossil-derived reagents, formed via C − H bond activation over zinc-indium-sulfides (Zn-In-S). Contrary to the commonly accepted stepwise electron-proton transfer pathway (PE-ET) for semiconductors, our experimental and theoretical studies evidence a concerted proton-coupled electron transfer (CPET) pathway. A pioneering microkinetic study, considering the relevant elementary steps of the surface chemistry, reveals a faster C − H activation with Zn-In-S because of circumventing formation of a charged radical, as it happens in PE-ET where it retards the catalysis due to strong site adsorption. For CPET over Zn-In-S, H abstraction, forming a neutral radical, is rate-limiting, but having lower energy barriers than that of PE-ET. The rate expressions derived from the microkinetics provide guidelines to rationally design semiconductor catalysis, e.g., for C − H activation, that is based on the CPET mechanism.

Reducing iridium (Ir) catalyst loading for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical strategy for large-scale hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. However, simultaneously achieving high activity, long-term stability, and reduced material cost remains challenging. To address this challenge, we develop a framework by combining density functional theory (DFT) prediction using model surfaces and proof-of-concept experimental verification using thin films and nanoparticles. DFT results predict that oxidized Ir monolayers over titanium nitride (IrO

Using an ultrahigh resolution (ΔE∼0.1eV) setup to measure electronic features in x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments at the European XFEL in Germany, we have studied the collective plasmon excitation in aluminium at ambient conditions, which we can measure very accurately even at low momentum transfers. As a result, we can resolve previously reported discrepancies between time-dependent density functional theory simulations and experimental observations. The demonstrated capability for high-resolution XRTS measurements will be a game changer for the diagnosis of experiments with matter under extreme densities, temperatures, and pressures, and unlock the full potential of state-of-the-art x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities to study planetary interior conditions, to understand inertial confinement fusion applications, and for material science and discovery.

Altermagnets (AM) is a recently discovered class of collinear magnets that share some properties (anomalous transport, etc) with ferromagnets, some (zero net magnetization) with antiferromagnets, while also exhibiting unique properties (spin-splitting of electronic bands and resulting spin-splitter current). Since the moment compensation in AM is driven by symmetry, it must be possible to identify them by analyzing the crystal structure directly, without computing the electronic structure. Given the significant potential of AM for spintronics, it is very useful to have a tool for such an analysis. This work presents an open-access code implementing such a direct check.

Abstract Theory‐guided materials design is an effective strategy for designing catalysts with high intrinsic activity whilst minimizing the usage of expensive metals like platinum. As proof‐of‐concept, herein it demonstrates that using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental validation that intermetallic PtCo 3 alloy nanoparticles offer enhanced electrocatatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to Pt nanoparticles. DFT calculations established that PtCo 3 (111) surfaces possess better intrinsic ORR activity compared to Pt(111) surfaces, owing to the synergistic action of adjacent Pt and Co active sites which optimizes the binding strength of ORR intermediates to boost overall ORR kinetics. With this understanding, a PtCo 3 /NC catalyst, comprising PtCo 3 nanoparticles exposing predominantly (111) facets dispersed on an N‐doped carbon support, is successfully fabricated. PtCo 3 /NC demonstrates a high specific activity (3.4 mA cm −2 mg Pt −1 ), mass activity (0.67 A mg Pt −1 ), and cycling stability for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH, significantly outperforming a commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, a zinc‐air battery (ZAB) assembled with PtCo 3 /NC as the air‐electrode catalyst delivered an open‐circuit voltage of 1.47 V, a specific capacity of 775.1 mAh g Zn −1 and excellent operation durability after 200 discharge/charge cycles, vastly superior performance to a ZAB built using commercial Pt/C+IrO 2 as the air‐electrode catalyst.

We present in situ measurements of spectrally resolved X-ray scattering and X-ray diffraction from monocrystalline diamond samples heated with an intense pulse of heavy ions. In this way, we determine the samples’ heating dynamics and their microscopic and macroscopic structural integrity over a timespan of several microseconds. Connecting the ratio of elastic to inelastic scattering with state-of-the-art density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations allows the inference of average temperatures around 1300 K, in agreement with predictions from stopping power calculations. The simultaneous diffraction measurements show no hints of any volumetric graphitization of the material, but do indicate the onset of fracture in the diamond sample. Our experiments pave the way for future studies at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, where a substantially increased intensity of the heavy ion beam will be available.

Development of low temperature catalytic pyrolysis technology for heated tobacco sheets is expected to increase the aroma of heated tobacco products and improve their overall smoking quality. In this study, the low temperature pyrolysis performances of heated tobacco sheets catalyzed by various anionic sodium salts were investigated using TG-DTG, Py-GC-MS technology and smoke routine chemical composition analysis. The results showed that the total weight loss between 100°C and 300°C increased by 7.8%–13.15% after adding various anionic sodium salts, among which, sodium acetate and sodium tartrate showed a relatively higher weight loss. The relative content of free hydroxyacetone, furfuryl alcohol, butyrolactone and megastigmatrienone in the pyrolysis gas increased, while the relative content of free nicotine decreased. With the change of anionic species, the catalytic decomposition ability of cellulose, lignin, and other substances may change, resulting in the distribution alteration of compounds in the pyrolysis gas. After adding sodium acetate and sodium citrate, the release of total particulate matter (TPM), glycerol, and nicotine in flue gas increased. Overall, the addition of sodium acetate and sodium citrate showed a higher low temperature pyrolysis performance of heated tobacco sheets. The research results in this paper provide data support for changing the low temperature catalytic pyrolysis performance of heated tobacco sheets by adjusting the type of anions in sodium salts.

In the recent era of green and sustainable energy, the demand for effective and efficient energy harvesting has dramatically increased. Piezoelectric energy harvesting, which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, is considered a viable strategy to achieve this goal. Janus-type nanomaterial, a noncentrosymmetric material with different elemental species in the upper and lower atomic layers, has gained interest due to its exotic properties compared to conventional bulk and symmetric materials. In this work, we systematically design and investigate a new class of Janus nanomaterials with enhanced intrinsic polarization via the successive ionic exchange method. Multiple layers of stability standards, including both thermodynamic and dynamic stabilities, are employed in the high-throughput screening procedure of novel Janus-type nanomaterials. The newly proposed Janus-type nanomaterials exhibit more than 10 times higher piezoelectric response compared to that of reported low-dimensional materials and even comparable to that of bulk materials.

Abstract Elemental phosphorus in its various allotropes has received tremendous research attention recently due to its intriguing electronic and structural properties. Notably, the application of nanostructured materials to overcome the inherent flaws in bulk materials is promising. However, many challenges need to be addressed before its widespread implementation. Thus, a specific tenet to design novel and robust nanomaterials is a decisive factor in the desired outcome, and the most daunting task before realizing this is solving the Schrödinger equation. First principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations have emerged as an insightful and accurate design tool to investigate the structural, electronic, and possible synthesis scenarios of yet undiscovered materials at atomic levels. In this review, the basic principles and the importance of DFT are discussed, followed by a summary of recent advances in the first principle study of elemental phosphorus‐based nanomaterials. Elemental phosphorus‐based nanomaterials and their allotropes have attracted growing interest in the renewable energy community due to their modulable product selectivity. However, the understanding of the physical phenomena of allotropic modification is still lacking. Therefore, the aim is to motivate experimental researchers to conduct DFT studies and experiments to comprehend relevant engineered nanomaterials better. Finally, the challenges and potential future research directions for further theoretical and computational development of phosphorus‐based nanomaterials are outlined.

Abstract Play is a multifunctional behavior that may confer different advantages depending on the context, the species, sex, and age of the players. Despite numerous studies of social play in primates, we know little about this behavior in platyrrhines. This study was designed to provide a systematic description of social play in a wild group of Geoffroy’s spider monkeys ( Ateles geoffroyi ). We conducted behavioral observations of acrobatic social play, object social play, cuddling play, and rough-and-tumble play in a large group of spider monkeys (N = 54) in Yucatan, Mexico. Over 5 months, we recorded and analyzed 104 play sessions. The probability of engaging in social play was higher for infants and juveniles than for subadults and adults, and it did not differ between sexes. Moreover, the probability of engaging in different types of social play did not vary across individuals based on their sex and age, nor on the frequency of play faces. Play sessions lasted longer when both players were younger and with a higher number of players, but there was no significant variation in session length associated with the frequency of play faces or players’ sex. Overall, our study revealed patterns of play behavior that suggest substantial flexibility in play in this species, in line with the high levels of tolerance that characterize spider monkeys.
