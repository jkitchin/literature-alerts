Abstract Design and preparation of freestanding bifunctional ordered structural catalysts with superior activity, low cost, and good reversibility, are crucial for commercial water‐splitting applications. In this study, a durable and effective NiS 2 /ReS 2 (NRS) electrocatalyst is successfully fabricated using various quantities of Re source on carbon cloth (CC) by a facile solvothermal method. Upon changing the quantities of the Re source, the catalyst dimensions and shape undergo substantial changes, enabling the control of the catalytic activity of NRS. In particular, the optimal NRS‐50@CC displays remarkable catalytic performance for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, revealing small overpotentials of 244 mV at 20 mA cm −2 and 108 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , respectively, as well as notable stability. Moreover, the NRS‐50@CC (+, −) cell device requires a voltage of ≈1.56 V at 10 mA cm −2 . This paper proposes a novel approach for the construction of durable bifunctional electrocatalysts using exceptionally active layered metal chalcogenide materials.

Abstract The photocatalytic synthesis of urea from CO 2 and N 2 co‐reduction presents a promising alternative to the conventional energy‐intensive Haber–Bosch process. However, competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface often limits selectivity and yield. Here, we designed hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) spheres, which serve as a high surface area scaffold for precise anchoring of Fe─Cu diatomic sites. Hollow architecture enhances light harvesting via inner‐scattering effects and charge separation. Each Fe─Cu site is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms, forming N 2 ─Fe 1 ─Cu 1 ─N 2 /C 3 N 4 DAC (hereafter referred to as FeCu/CN), which enables cooperative activation of CO 2 and N 2 , in contrast to monodispersed diatomic (Fe+Cu/CN), and single‐atom catalysts (Fe/CN, Cu/CN). The FeCu/CN bonded pairs serve as highly efficient active centers, facilitating the synergistic adsorption and activation of multiple reactants. Specifically, during the co‐reduction of CO 2 and N 2 , the Fe 1 site preferentially adsorbs and activates CO 2 , while bonded Cu 1 sites stabilize N 2 on FeCu/CN and enable synergistic C─N coupling through the formation of *NCON intermediates. As a result, the FeCu/CN achieves an exceptional urea yield of 7.40 mg·g cat −1 ·h −1 with a 38.58% selectivity under visible light irradiation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atomic‐level coordination in multireactants and offer insights into the C─N coupling for value‐added products using CO 2 and N 2 as feedstock.

During the recent decade, the search for catalytically active cathodes of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells and secondary metal–air batteries has been one of the priority directions of electrochemical energy applications. Existing highly efficient electrocatalysts based on very expensive and rare platinum (Pt) and Pt group elements need replacement with affordable and scalable electrode materials. In this article, we review the recent trends and progress in the research of ORR catalysts alternative to Pt group elements, namely, silver (Ag)‐based nanostructured cathodes. The following main research directions are presented: (1) the O 2 electroreduction mechanism; (2) nanostructured and nanoporous Ag surfaces; (3) Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) anchored to a carbon substrate; (4) Ag nanostructures deposited onto M x O y − carbon nanocomposites; (5) bimetallic Ag–M nanostructures. The first direction encompasses the analysis of literature data on ORR on Ag surface, which is stable in alkaline electrolytes and provides a four‐electron (4e) pathway for the ORR. In the second direction, we demonstrate the dependence of electroreduction efficiency on the size and shape of AgNPs and their nanoscale porosity. The third direction is based on the enhancement of catalytic activity via designing of fine and ultrafine AgNPs attached to highly porous carbon support nanomaterials such as carbon black, mesoporous carbon (MC), reduced graphene oxide, nitrogen‐doped graphene, multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). The fourth direction, hybrid AgNPs–M x O y /carbon nanocomposites, is one of the most promising for ORR applications. The catalytic activity of these nanocomposites is based on the synergy of the AgNPs–M x O y couple, and the nanoscale porosity of carbon materials ensures mass transport of dissolved oxygen to the electrode surface. We describe the characteristic features of electrochemical oxygen reduction for the systems of AgNPs with nanoparticles of MnO 2 , ZrO 2 , WO 3 , Fe 3 O 4 and Co 3 O 4 , which can tune Ag surface states. The fifth separate research direction is the use of bimetallic Ag–M nanostructures for electrocatalytic ORR. The most studied systems are binary, including Ag–Pd, Ag–Cu, Ag–Co and Ag–Ni. This review outlines the trends and prospects of future development of the Ag‐based nanostructured catalytically active cathodes for oxygen reduction.

The development of efficient dual-atom catalysts (DACs) requires an atomic-level understanding on the microscopic coordination environment that is hard to characterize experimentally. Herein we rationally design DACs with diverse Fe-Co/N3O3 configurations, among which the NNFeOOCoNO-coordinated configuration is identified to exhibit superior stability and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity based on first-principles calculations. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the ORR is triggered by side-on adsorption of O2 on the Co site, enabled by strong hybridization between Co 3dxz/yz orbitals and O2 π* antibonding states. The high-spin Fe2+ acts as an electron reservoir by transferring charge to Co and lowering its d-band center. The Fe-Co synergy suppresses excessive *OH binding (ΔG4 = +0.107 eV in Fe-free Co@NO3) and positions the system to the ORR volcano apex. In summary, synergistic catalysis could be unlocked by rational coordination environmental design combined with spin-state-modulated charge redistribution.

Abstract Dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) display excellent activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The dual‐metal configuration allows for synergistic interactions and tailored adsorption of key intermediates, thereby breaking traditional * OH– * OOH scaling relations and enabling dissociative O 2 activation pathways. Recent studies suggest that the metal–metal (M–M) distance within DACs critically influences their electronic structure and catalytic behavior; however, a deep understanding of M–M distance effects on ORR thermodynamics and kinetics is presently lacking. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling are performed on 108 DACs with varied M–M distances (2.2–3.5 Å). Moderate M–M distances (≈3 Å) are found to weaken * OH binding, lower the * OH– * OOH scaling slope, and promote bridging O 2 adsorption for facile dissociation. The dissociative pathway lowered the effective scaling relation from ≈3.2 to 2.72 eV, approaching the theoretical value of 2.46 eV. Micro‐kinetic simulations identified O 2 activation as the rate‐determining step during ORR, with DACs possessing a M–M distance ≈3 Å exhibiting the highest turnover frequencies, due the effective balancing of active‐site availability and O 2 activation efficiency. These findings highlight the key role of M–M distance in controlling ORR activity, guiding the design of next‐generation DACs with improved efficiency.

Abstract Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered significant interest lately for all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) because of their easy processability and flexibility; however, their low ionic conductivity has to be enhanced by forming composite polymer electrolyte (CPE). Herein, a polyacrylonitrile (PAN)‐based triple‐composite solid polymer electrolyte with black phosphorus nanosheets (BPN) and SiO 2 nanoparticles (SO) is reported, which synergistically utilizes the efficient directed Li+ pathways (via BP) while reducing PAN crystallization (by SiO 2 ) and enhancing the dissociation of Li salts. Thus, an impressive ionic conductivity of 4.41 × 10 −4 S cm −1 is realised in PAN‐BPN‐SO‐LiClO4 CPE, which is 65 times higher than that of PAN‐LiClO 4 (6.8 × 10 −6 S cm −1 ). A wider electrochemical stability window (up to 4.68 V vs Li/Li + ) is also realized, enabling compatibility with high‐voltage cathodes. The BPN‐SO CPE exhibited good discharge capacities 146 mAh g −1 at 0.1C and 108 mAh g −1 at 1C rate, with 75% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The graphite/LiFePO 4 full‐cell with PAN‐BPN‐SO‐LIClO4 CPE showed a room‐temperature discharge capacity of 87 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C, which is significantly enhanced to 152 mAh g −1 at 40 °C. A CPE‐based pouch cell (12 cm 2 , 111.29 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C) performed well in folding, puncturing, and cutting performance tests. A computational modelling study is performed to elucidate the mechanism.

The dynamic reconstruction of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts dictates their performance, yet conventional Ir-based materials face an inherent activity-stability trade-off due to surface amorphization into hydrous IrOx phases accompanied by lattice oxygen mechanisms. Here, we uncover a distinct reconstruction pathway for supported Ir nanoparticles, where a TiOx@Ti substrate drives a bulk phase transition from metallic Ir to crystalline rutile IrO2 during electrocatalysis. Unlike surface-limited amorphization, this support-guided crystallization shifts the reaction mechanism from involving lattice oxygen mechanism to the complete adsorbate evolution mechanism, as confirmed by mechanistic and structural analyses. Consequently, the Ir/TiOx@Ti catalyst achieves both high activity and durability in acidic media, demonstrated in three-electrode systems and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. This work redefines support roles in electrocatalyst reconstruction, demonstrating that bulk phase engineering-rather than surface modification-resolves the long-standing efficiency-durability conflict in acidic oxygen evolution.

Abstract The photocatalytic synthesis of urea from CO 2 and N 2 co‐reduction presents a promising alternative to the conventional energy‐intensive Haber–Bosch process. However, competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface often limits selectivity and yield. Here, we designed hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) spheres, which serve as a high surface area scaffold for precise anchoring of Fe─Cu diatomic sites. Hollow architecture enhances light harvesting via inner‐scattering effects and charge separation. Each Fe─Cu site is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms, forming N 2 ─Fe 1 ─Cu 1 ─N 2 /C 3 N 4 DAC (hereafter referred to as FeCu/CN), which enables cooperative activation of CO 2 and N 2 , in contrast to monodispersed diatomic (Fe+Cu/CN), and single‐atom catalysts (Fe/CN, Cu/CN). The FeCu/CN bonded pairs serve as highly efficient active centers, facilitating the synergistic adsorption and activation of multiple reactants. Specifically, during the co‐reduction of CO 2 and N 2 , the Fe 1 site preferentially adsorbs and activates CO 2 , while bonded Cu 1 sites stabilize N 2 on FeCu/CN and enable synergistic C─N coupling through the formation of *NCON intermediates. As a result, the FeCu/CN achieves an exceptional urea yield of 7.40 mg·g cat −1 ·h −1 with a 38.58% selectivity under visible light irradiation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atomic‐level coordination in multireactants and offer insights into the C─N coupling for value‐added products using CO 2 and N 2 as feedstock.

Abstract This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the carbon capture and storage value chain, focusing on cost optimization strategies and frameworks for successful development. Through systematic evaluation of capture-transport-storage components, we identify critical cost drivers and demonstrate methodologies for economic optimization in early-stage project development. Carbon capture technologies constitute the primary cost component, accounting for 60-80% of total chain (IEA 2024), with post-combustion systems exhibiting energy penalties of 25-35% compared to 15-20% for advanced solvents (Environmental Science & Technology 2024). Transportation costs range from 0.25-55.82 euros per tonne depending on distance and flowrate, while storage costs demonstrate significant variability based on geological conditions and monitoring requirements (MDPI 2024). Cost optimization analysis confirms that cluster and hub models achieve 30-40% cost reductions compared to standalone facilities when maintaining utilization rates above 80% (World Economic Forum 2025). The Northern Lights and Porthos projects early implementation results provide encouraging indicators of successful multi-stakeholder collaboration approaches (Equinor. 2024; Port of Rotterdam. 2024). Digital cost estimation methodologies enable progressive accuracy improvement until final investment decision, supporting systematic project optimization throughout development phases.

The water molecule’s electronic Cartesian multipole moment and polarizability tensors have been fitted with Gaussian process regression to the internal coordinates and are used to evaluate accurate electrostatic, induction, and dispersion energy components between flexible molecules. The model yields a handful of damping and scaling parameters that were adjusted for the energy components to agree with 2-body symmetry-adapted perturbation theory decomposition and then fine-tuned in order for the total energy to agree with CCSD(T) for small clusters. We present a simple algorithm for rotating symmetric Cartesian tensors and employ a dispersion potential based on multipole polarizabilities. At short range, the 2- and 3-body potential energy was corrected to CCSD(T) accuracy using Gaussian approximation potentials. The radial distribution function and self-diffusion coefficient obtained with molecular dynamics simulations agree well with experiments.

The advancement of efficient energy conversion and storage technologies is fundamentally linked to the development of electrochemical systems, including fuel cells, batteries, and electrolyzers, whose performance depends on key electrocatalytic reactions: hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), oxygen reduction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction (NRR). Beyond catalyst design, the electrolyte microenvironment significantly influences these reactions by modulating charge transfer, intermediate stabilization, and mass transport, making electrolyte engineering a powerful tool for enhancing performance. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of how fundamental electrolyte properties, including pH, ionic strength, ion identity, and solvent structure, affect the mechanisms and kinetics of these five reactions. We examine in detail how the electrolyte composition and individual ion contributions impact reaction pathways, catalytic activity, and product selectivity. For HER and OER, we discuss the interplay between acidic and alkaline environments, the effects of specific ions, interfacial electric fields, and catalyst stability. In ORR, we highlight pH-dependent activity, selectivity, and the roles of cations and anions in steering 2e− versus 4e− pathways. The CO2RR and NRR sections explore how the electrolyte composition, local pH, buffering capacity, and proton sources influence activity and the product distribution. We also address challenges in electrolyte optimization, such as managing competing reactions and maximizing Faradaic efficiency. By comparing the electrolyte’s effects across these reactions, this review identifies general trends and design guidelines for enhancing electrocatalytic performance and outlines key open questions and future research directions relevant to practical energy technologies.

Constructing model catalysts to clarify the active sites and elucidate structure–activity relationships represents a bottleneck issue in electrocatalytic reactions. For instance, Fe-based materials have been widely investigated for various electrocatalytic reactions, e.g., CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR). However, the precise role of Fe in the catalytic mechanism remains debated and is under extensive investigation due to the complex properties of those catalysts. Herein, we successfully construct a series of monolayer Fe clusters (ML-Fe) on a single-crystal Au(111) substrate via vapor deposition under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, which serve as model catalysts for CO2RR. Notably, the size of Fe clusters can be tuned at the atomic scale (∼2 nm) as observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ML-Fe achieves >60% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO production during CO2RR. When the Fe layer further increases to form nanoparticles, Fe sites exhibit stronger electron interaction and binding strength with *CO intermediates, consequently shifting the dominant reaction pathway from CO2RR to hydrogen evolution (HER). This work could provide valuable insights into designing model catalysts with well-defined active sites to investigate the structure–activity relationships in diverse electrocatalytic systems.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a pivotal process in electrochemical water splitting, directly determines energy conversion efficiency. Ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts have gained considerable attention in recent years due to their decent intrinsic activity in acidic media. Previous studies have demonstrated that while Ru exhibits superior OER activity compared to RuO2 in acidic environments, its operational stability remains markedly inferior. This performance dichotomy, coupled with the persistent challenges of active species dissolution and catalyst particle aggregation during prolonged operation, significantly hinders their practical implementation in electrochemical systems. To address these challenges, this study develops a carbon nanotube (CNT)/Fe-Ni@RuO2@PANI-350 composite catalyst composed of RuO2 nanoparticles supported on bimetallic Fe-Ni modified CNTs (CNT/Fe-Ni) and encapsulated with polyaniline (PANI). This catalyst utilizes the anchoring effect of bimetallic Fe-Ni sites and the spatial confinement effect of PANI coating layer, effectively inhibiting the dissolution and agglomeration of RuO2 during both high-temperature processing and electrochemical operation, thereby significantly enhancing electrochemical stability. The anchoring strength of RuO2 nanoparticles on CNT/Fe-Ni support via the nano-confinement effect, as well as the microscopic mechanisms underlying the performance enhancement, are revealed by density functional theory calculations and experimental characterizations. The composite catalyst demonstrates fascinating OER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4, exhibiting a low Tafel slope of 39.1 mV dec-1 as well as low overpotentials of 188 and 225 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. Remarkably, the composite catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced stability, exhibiting only ~30 mV overpotential increase during 150 h continuous operation at 10 mA cm-2. This study highlights a simple yet effective nano-confinement strategy to address the challenges of Ru-based catalysts, and provides a practical paradigm for designing and preparing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts with enhanced stability.

Abstract The secure and efficient delivery of energy demands advanced solutions, such as protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs). Despite their promise, challenges including sluggish oxygen electrode kinetics and phase instability in humid or CO 2 ‐rich environments hinder their widespread adoption. Herein, a novel high‐entropy double perovskite oxide (HEDPO), Pr 0.2 La 0.2 Nd 0.2 Na 0.2 Ca 0.2 Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1.5 Fe 0.5 O 5+δ (PLNNCBSCF), engineered to leverage the stabilizing effects of high configurational entropy while delivering superior electrochemical performance is developed. Physicochemical characterization confirms the successful formation of a high‐entropy matrix, providing enhanced structural stability and a high density of catalytically active defects. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the dynamic atomic configurations and heterogeneous electronic distributions within PLNNCBSCF facilitate improved electrochemical reaction kinetics. PCECs incorporating PLNNCBSCF oxygen electrodes demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a peak power density of 1.77 W·cm −2 in fuel cell mode and a current density of 4.42 A·cm −2 at 1.3 V in electrolysis cell mode at 650 °C. These findings highlight the potential of HEDPOs as robust, high‐performance oxygen electrodes, paving the way for sustainable energy technologies in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

Discovering chemical reaction pathways using quantum mechanics is impractical for many systems of practical interest because of unfavorable scaling and computational cost. While machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on quantum mechanical data offer a promising alternative, they face challenges for reactive systems due to the need for extensive sampling of the potential energy surface in regions that are far from equilibrium geometries. Unfortunately, traditional MLIP training protocols are not designed for comprehensive reaction exploration. We present a reactive active learning (RAL) framework that is designed to efficiently train MLIPs to achieve near-quantum mechanical accuracy for reactive systems for situations where one may not have prior knowledge of the possible transition states, reaction pathways, or even the potential products. Our method combines automated reaction exploration, uncertainty-driven active learning, and transition state sampling to build accurate potentials. We demonstrate RAL's effectiveness across three different systems: uncatalyzed ammonia synthesis (gas-phase), methanimine hydrolysis (solution phase), and methane activation on titanium carbide surfaces (heterogeneous). The resulting MLIPs accurately predict reaction barriers and transition states. For catalysis, we show that RAL-trained MLIPs identify Ti2C as the most active methane activation surface (90% decomposition at 1000 K) through C-vacancy mediated mechanisms. The framework's ability to simulate large systems (∼900 atoms) over nanosecond time scales provides previously inaccessible insights into surface poisoning and reaction networks. We show that reactive exploration is essential for adequately capturing the potential energy surface, with chemical and configurational sampling working synergistically to improve model accuracy. Our results establish general guidelines for training robust reactive potentials and open new possibilities for computational discovery of catalysts and reaction mechanisms.

Abstract Cobalt spinel (Co 3 O 4 ) is a dynamically restructuring catalyst under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. So far, little is known about the mechanistic complexity of the OER at different active sites of Co 3 O 4 at the atomic level. Using the A‐ and B‐terminations of a single‐crystal Co 3 O 4 (001) model electrode, we apply a combination of density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to identify three main types of active sites of Co 3 O 4 under OER conditions. In addition to tetrahedral and octahedral surface sites, we report the formation of pseudo‐octahedral sites due to a change in the local environment upon adsorption of intermediate species. For all these active sites, we analyze the elementary steps of the OER by descriptor‐based analysis and the concept of degree of span control. While octahedral and pseudo‐octahedral sites are catalytically more active than tetrahedral sites, we show structural sensitivity with respect to the key limiting reaction step, which ranges from O─O bond formation to O 2 desorption and *OH oxidation. Our modeling strategy, which captures changes in the local environment, elementary steps of the OER, and the contribution of different reaction steps to the current density, provides an integrated and comprehensive framework for describing complex oxide materials under applied bias.

ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing sustainable materials science, yet a comprehensive and timely evaluation of the rapidly evolving AI techniques applied across the entire materials lifecycle remains lacking. This work reviews AI‐driven advances in sustainable materials, specifically focusing on battery materials, thermal management materials, energy conversion materials, and catalysts. The key patterns, capabilities, and limitations of AI are identified across three interconnected phases: sustainable materials design (leveraging predictive and generative models for accelerated discovery), green processing (integrating adaptive synthesis optimization and autonomous experimentation), and extending to lifecycle management (encompassing real‐time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and intelligent recycling). Then, the persistent challenges, including data sparsity, domain‐specific knowledge integration, and limited model generalizability, are investigated, followed by an exploration of emerging solutions such as federated learning for privacy‐preserving data sharing, physics‐informed neural networks for knowledge integration, and multimodal AI for cross‐modal knowledge transfer. Finally, the computational sustainability challenges of AI methods themselves are also discussed. This review highlights key bottlenecks impeding scalable adoption and discuss pathways for realizing the full potential of AI in sustainable materials development.

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have recently emerged as promising electrocatalysts for complex reactions owing to their tunable electronic structures and diverse, unique binding sites. However, their vast compositional space, in terms of both elemental variety and atomic ratios, presents a major challenge to the rational design of high-performance catalysts, as experimental efforts are often hindered by ambiguous element selection and inefficient trial-and-error methods. In this work, a bottom-up research strategy using machine learning-assisted first-principles calculations was applied to accelerate the design of quinary HEAs toward efficient multielectron transfer reactions. Here, we report the design of PtPdRhRuMo, which exhibits key physicochemical properties favoring the methanol oxidation reaction. Notably, the incorporation of Mo as the fifth element significantly activates specific binding sites on HEA surfaces, enhancing methanol adsorption and, in particular, the water dissociation ability. This facilitates hydroxyl species formation, which effectively mitigates CO intermediate adherence while promoting the complete oxidation of CH3OH to CO2 via alternative reaction pathways. Guided by theoretical predictions, experimental samples with different morphologies of mesoporous PtPdRhRuMo catalyst (m-HEANP(Mo) nanoparticles and m-HEAF(Mo) thin film) were then synthesized, demonstrating superior electrocatalysis with a large current density of up to 18.20 mA cm-2 and a mass activity of 9.89 A mgPt-1, alongside the long-term durability for efficient methanol electrooxidation applications.

Abstract Catalyst deactivation due to *CO poisoning is a persistent challenge in the electrochemical oxidation of biomass-derived molecules such as glycerol and glucose. On platinum catalysts, *CO forms readily as a reaction intermediate, blocking active sites and requiring high overpotentials for removal—often leading to undesired overoxidation of valuable products. Understanding the fundamental origins of *CO formation is thus critical for designing more selective and stable catalysts. Since biomass oxidation can be extremely complex and involve a multitude of adsorbates and products, here we use a simplified model system, formate oxidation, to investigate *CO formation on Pt in alkaline pH . Starting from operando surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy, we show that the adsorption configuration of formate determines if the surface will be poisoned by *CO. Oxygen-bound formate (*OOCH) undergoes direct and stable oxidation to CO₂, while carbon-bound formate (*COOH) disproportionates to form *CO–*OH, initiating poisoning. These insights offer a mechanistic foundation for designing Pt-based catalysts that resist *CO formation by selectively stabilizing *OOCH over *COOH intermediates, with broader implications for improving biomass electrooxidation performance.

Abstract Fenton‐like systems utilizing micro‐electric field‐engineered catalysts have emerged as a promising technology for water remediation, demonstrating distinctive advantages via their efficient electron transport networks. This innovative approach not only significantly reduces oxidant consumption but also enables thorough mineralization of contaminants. However, current research faces critical challenges in fundamental mechanistic understanding, particularly regarding reactor scale‐up strategies and biological synergy mechanisms, where a cohesive theoretical framework remains to be established. This comprehensive review systematically addresses four pivotal aspects: i) Mechanistic elucidation of charge transfer dynamics and pollutant transformation pathways in micro‐electric field‐enhanced Fenton systems; ii) Development of structure‐activity relationship models for system optimization; iii) Implementation of modular scale‐up methodologies with pilot‐scale validation for engineering feasibility assessment; iv) Quantitative environmental impact evaluation using full lifecycle assessment under carbon neutrality objectives. By methodically analyzing technical bottlenecks and advancement pathways, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing micro‐electric field regulation in environmental remediation applications. The insights presented are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable water treatment solutions, offering innovative approaches for pollution control aligned with global carbon emission reduction targets.
