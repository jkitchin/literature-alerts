The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the most prominent electrocatalytic reactions of green energy transition. However, the kinetics across materials and electrolyte pH and the impact of hydrogen coverage at high current densities remain poorly understood. Here, we study the HER kinetics over a large set of nanoparticle catalysts in industrially relevant acidic and alkaline membrane electrode assemblies that are only operated with pure water humidified gases. We discover distinct kinetic fingerprints between the iron triad (Fe, Ni, Co), coinage (Au, Cu, Ag), and platinum group metals (Ir, Pt, Pd, Rh). Importantly, the applied bias changes not only the activation energy (EA) but also the pre-exponential factor (A). We interpret these changes as entropic changes in the interfacial solvent that differ between acid and base and entropic changes on the surface due to a changing hydrogen coverage. Finally, we observe that anions can induce Butler–Volmer behavior for the coinage metals in acid. Our results provide a new foundation to understand HER kinetics and, more broadly, highlight the pressing need to update common understanding of basic concepts in the field of electrocatalysis.

Abstract Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) employing Ir/Ru‐free anodes emerges as a bright prospect for green hydrogen society. Here, a Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 nanosheet electrocatalyst is reported, in situ grown on stainless‐steel paper, as an efficient and durable self‐supporting AEMWE anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The interstitial [MnSe 4 ] tetrahedra elevate the Fermi level and narrows the band gap of the electrocatalyst, thereby expediting electrode reaction kinetics and increasing the electrical conductivity. In addition, the interstitial Mn atoms attenuate the electron density of Ni and Fe and motivate phase transition to actual active (Mn, Fe)‐doped γ ‐NiOOH species. The downward d ‐band center of Ni active center facilitates the rate‐limiting * OOH desorption step, refreshing the active center, and reducing the free energy barriers for OER. Accordingly, the Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 electrode achieves OER overpotentials of 149 and 232 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH. The AEMWE cell incorporating Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 anode demonstrates high performance (1.0 A cm −2 at 1.68 V cell ) and durability (at 1 A cm −2 for 300 h), surpassing most AEMWE cells that use NiFe‐based anodes. This work highlights the potential of noble‐metal‐free anodes for efficient and durable AEMWE.

Abstract Six types of M x Sb y compounds (Fe, Co, and Ni antimonides) are synthesized in form of mono‐dispersed nanocrystallites (NCs) via a hot‐injection metathesis‐reduction. Various contents of Sb atoms are found to drive crystallographic structure and re‐coordination in the M x Sb y materials, leading to rhythmical changes of orthorhombic M 3 Sb→hexagonal MSb→monoclinic (or orthorhombic) MSb 2 . The crystallography is identified as crucial factor in electrocatalysis of water splitting at cathodic and anodic electrodes, respectively. Owning to the in‐plane microstrain distributed along (001) plane, the synthesized Ni 3 Sb NCs are more suitable to catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), sharing overpotential (η 10 ) of 93 mV@10 mA cm −2 with Tafel slope of 45 mV dec −1 , and extremely low hydrogen adsorption resistance (0.019 Ω) is obtained. The orthorhombic FeSb 2 NCs featured with larger deprotonation capacity of 13.71 mC V −1 excelled in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrolysis, and is confirmed to facilitate minimal deformation of the OOH * . The integrated devices (FeSb 2 ‖Ni 3 Sb) are tested as efficient catalyst for overall water splitting (1.58 V@10 mA cm −2 ) with long stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidated the particular coordination of Sb with proper electronegativity (2.05) is able to adjust active sites, relax electronic attraction, and benefit electrochemical reactions.

Abstract An efficient approach for fabrication of non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalyst is desirable for designing the energy storage and conversion devices in real‐world usages due to low cost and excellent catalytic properties. The preparation of hollow carbon capsules (HCC) containing cobalt (Co)‐based electrocatalyst is reported by a simple synthesis process without using templates for the first time. Initially, cobalt phenylphosphonate (Co‐MOF) nanorods are fabricated through a simple hydrothermal approach. The as‐formed Co‐MOF is covered with a thin coating of polydopamine (DP‐Co‐MOF) through chemical polymerization of dopamine in Tris‐HCl (pH 8.5). The DP‐Co‐MOF is used as self‐degraded template for the formation of HCC under pyrolysis. The formation mechanism and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of HCC are investigated. The hollow structure derived under N 2 exhibits a low overpotential (295 mV at 100 mA cm −2 ) with excellent stability (90.98%) for 150 h, which is further verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the designed anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer based on C─Co─N as cathode delivers a current density of 500 mA cm −2 (at 2.19 V) and 1000 mAcm −2 (at 2.33 V) in 1.0 m KOH at 60 °C. The fabricated new Co‐based electrocatalyst is highly beneficial for the fabrication of cost‐effective and high‐performance AEMWEs.

A chemical recycling process that reduces polymers to their raw materials plays a crucial role in circular economy. To contribute to chemical recycling, this study proposes a system that simulates the process of depolymerization from polymer-to-monomer using reactive molecular dynamics (MD). Two MD methods, Reax force field (ReaxFF) and neural network potential (NNP), were employed to simulate the depolymerization of a polystyrene model. We validated the simulation accuracies by comparing monomer yields and decomposition products with experimental results. The results showed that NNP-MD accurately replicated the degradation and redecomposition processes and achieved consistency with the experimental data at various temperatures. ReaxFF-MD, however, was less able to represent the depolymerization process. We conclude that NNP-MD is capable of simulating polymer depolymerization results that are consistent with experimental observations. These results contribute to the development of methods for efficient chemical recycling and the broader realization of a circular economy.

In actual flight conditions, the surface of thermal protection materials may experience stress, and the impact of surface strain on catalytic reaction and mechanical–chemical coupling has not been fully explored. In this study, a surface gas–solid interaction model was constructed using reaction molecular dynamics and density functional theory methods. The surface catalytic reaction characteristics of α-SiO2 (001) under up to 2% uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain were investigated. Results indicate that both uniaxial stretching along the X axis and biaxial stretching along the X and Y axes inhibit the catalytic recombination reaction at higher surface temperatures. For the uniaxial stretching model, when the strain reaches 2%, the catalytic coefficient decreases by 21.2%, whereas for the biaxial stretching model, it decreases by 34.3%. From the perspectives of surface morphology and energy, the study reveals that tensile strain reduces the undercoordination degree of Si atoms on the surface, reduces the surface energy of α-SiO2 (001), increases the activation energy of the atomic oxygen recombination reaction, alters the recombination pathways of oxygen atoms, strain-induced selective desorption of oxygen atoms reduces the recombination probabilities of both Eley–Rideal and Langmuir–Hinshelwood pathways, ultimately decreasing the catalytic recombination coefficient.

The electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) represents one of the most prospective avenues for the in situ synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the four-electron competition reaction constrains the efficiency of H2O2 synthesis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop superior catalysts to facilitate the H2O2 synthesis. In this study, graphite-phase carbon nitride and cerium dioxide composites (g-C3N4/CeO2) with varying CeO2 loadings were prepared with favorable 2e-ORR electrocatalysts. The optimized composite, containing 20 wt % CeO2 (g-C3N4/CeO2-20%) exhibited the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97% and notable H2O2 yielding of 9.84 mol gcat.–1 h–1 at the potential of 0.3 V (vs RHE) in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the improvement of the selectivity and yield of H2O2 for the composites were attributed to the charge transfer between g-C3N4 and CeO2, which causes the active site C atom donating electrons to form C+, thereby enhancing the adsorption and desorption of *OOH intermediates. Additionally, the g-C3N4/CeO2-20% composite exhibits excellent 2e-ORR performance in neutral and acidic electrolytes and demonstrates superior capability in electro-Fenton degradation of organic pollutants. This study not only provides new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism of g-C3N4/CeO2 composites but also demonstrates an effective method for designing 2e-ORR catalysts.

Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) require ongoing improvement and innovation to effectively address challenges across various domains. Developing MLFF models typically involves extensive screening, tuning, and iterative testing. However, existing packages based on a single mature descriptor or model are unsuitable for this process. Therefore, we developed a package named ABFML, based on PyTorch, which aims to promote MLFF innovation by providing developers with a rapid, efficient, and user-friendly tool for constructing, screening, and validating new force field models. Moreover, by leveraging standardized module operations and cutting-edge machine learning frameworks, developers can swiftly establish models. In addition, the platform can seamlessly transition to the graphics processing unit environments, enabling accelerated calculations and large-scale parallel simulations of molecular dynamics. In contrast to traditional from-scratch approaches for MLFF development, ABFML significantly lowers the barriers to developing force field models, thereby expediting innovation and application within the MLFF development domains.

The controlled formation of a functional adlayer at the catalyst-water interface is a highly challenging yet potentially powerful strategy to accelerate proton transfer and deprotonation for ultimately improving the performance of proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). In this study, the synthesis of robust vinylene-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possessing high proton conductivities is reported, which are subsequently hybridized with ruthenium dioxide yielding high-performance anodic catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In situ spectroscopic measurements corroborated by theoretical calculations reveal that the assembled hydrogen bonds formed between COFs and adsorbed oxo-intermediates effectively orient interfacial water molecules, stabilizing the transition states for intermediate formation of OER. This determines a decrease in the energy barriers of proton transfer and deprotonation, resulting in exceptional acidic OER performance. When integrated into a PEMWE device, the system achieves a record current density of 1.0 A cm-2 at only 1.54 V cell voltage, with a long-term stability exceeding 180 h at industrial-level 200 mA cm-2. The approach relying on the self-assembly of an oriented hydrogen-bonded adlayer highlights the disruptive potential of COFs with customizable structures and multifunctional sites for advancing PEMWE technologies.

Abstract This current investigation evaluates the feasibility of employing potential adsorbents obtained from various biomass waste substances, namely, (i) coconut shell, (ii) rice husk, and (iii) eucalyptus wood, for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture applications. Activated carbons are obtained from abundantly available renewable biomass residues by single‐stage activation. The adsorption properties are evaluated using advanced techniques. Further, the adsorbents are packed in an in‐house fabricated post‐combustion adsorption chamber. In this investigation, the feasibility of employing adsorbents for capturing CO 2 and NO by using an adsorption technique in a diesel engine‐operated standby diesel generator set intended to supply electrical power to a guest house, hostels, faculty quarters, and residential area in an educational institution in India is investigated. Essential parameters such as (i) maximum adsorption capacity, (ii) fractional adsorption kinetics, (iii) regenerability and reusability, (iv) dynamic adsorption of the breakthrough curve, and (v) isosteric enthalpy of adsorption of adsorbent samples are also examined. Compared to the other adsorbents examined, eucalyptus wood adsorbent mitigates CO 2 and NO by 50% and 36% at full load, respectively.

## Microkinetic Modelling of Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Ir(111)@N‐Graphene Surface

Abstract We have explored the thermodynamics and microkinetic aspects of oxygen evolution catalysis on low loading of Ir(111) on nitrogen‐doped graphene at constant potential. The electronic modification induced by N‐doping is the reason for the reduced overpotential of OER. The N‐induced defect in the charge density is observed with increasing charge‐depleted region around the Ir atoms. The lattice contraction shifts the d‐band center away from the Fermi level, which increases the barrier for OH* and O* formation on Ir(111) supported on NGr (Ir(111)@NGr). Thus, highly endothermic O* formation reduces the OOH* formation, which is the potential determining step.

Two‐dimensional transition metal porphyrinoid materials (2DTMPoidMats), due to their unique electronic structure and tunable metal active sites, have the potential to enhance interactions with nitrogen molecules and promote the protonation process, making them promising electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) electrocatalysts. Experimentally screening a large number of catalysts for eNRR catalytic performance would consume considerable time and economic resources. First‐principles calculations and machine learning (ML) algorithms could greatly improve the efficiency of catalyst screening. Using this approach, we selected 86 candidates capable of catalyzing eNRR from 1290 types of 2DTMPoidMats, and verified the results with density functional theory (DFT) computations. Analysis of the full reaction pathway shows that MoPp‐meso‐F‐β‐Py, MoPp‐β‐Cl‐meso‐Diyne, MoPp‐meso‐Ethinyl, and WPp‐β‐Pz exhibit the best catalytic performance with the onset potential of −0.22, −0.19, −0.23, and −0.35 V, respectively. This work provides valuable insights into efficient design and screening of eNRR catalysts and promotes the application of ML algorithmic models in the field of catalysis.

Abstract Since the excessive exploitation of fossil fuels will cause wars for oil, developing sustainable and eco‐friendly energy resources to solve the energy crisis and realize the carbon‐neutrality goal has been a hot issue. Water electrolysis has been acknowledged as a promising technology for hydrogen (H 2 )/oxygen (O 2 ) evolution reaction (HER/OER) since the overall water splitting reaction rates can be well controlled by applying appropriate electrode voltage. Whereas the sluggish electrochemical reactions kinetics on both the cathode and anode have greatly restricted the energy conversion efficiency. Thus, developing highly active electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotentials required for electrolytic HER/OER is of great significance in increasing the utilization rates of electrical power and lowering production costs. ABO 3 ‐structured perovskite‐oxides based electrocatalysts possess the merits of low cost, high structural stability, and lattice compatibility, and thus they have attracted intense research attention in recent decays. To inspire both theoretical and experimental researchers to design novel perovskite‐oxide electrocatalysts for efficient HER/OER, the fundamental electrode reaction mechanisms, the effects of synthetic methods on material morphologies, recently reported perovskite‐oxide electrocatalysts and effective tuning strategies on enhancing the electrocatalytic activities of existing perovskite‐oxides have been fully discussed in this review.

Electrochemical reactions are pivotal for energy conversion and storage to achieve a carbon-neutral and sustainable society, and optimal electrocatalysts are essential for their industrial applications. Theoretical modeling methodologies, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), efficiently assess electrochemical reaction mechanisms and electrocatalyst performance at atomic and molecular levels. However, its intrinsic algorithm limitations and high computational costs for large-scale systems generate gaps between experimental observations and calculation simulation, restricting the accuracy and efficiency of electrocatalyst design. Combining machine learning (ML) is a promising strategy to accelerate the development of electrocatalysts. The ML-DFT frameworks establish accurate property–structure–performance relations to predict and verify novel electrocatalysts' properties and performance, providing a deep understanding of reaction mechanisms. The ML-based methods also accelerate the solution of MD and DFT. Moreover, integrating ML and experiment characterization techniques represents a cutting-edge approach to providing insights into the structural, electronic, and chemical changes under working conditions. This review will summarize the DFT development and the current ML application status for electrocatalyst design in various electrochemical energy conversions. The underlying physical fundaments, application advancements, and challenges will be summarized. Finally, future research directions and prospects will be proposed to guide novel electrocatalyst design for the sustainable energy revolution.

Interpreting the X-ray spectra of liquids is complicated by their selective structural sensitivity and ensemble averaging. We report nitrogen K-edge spectra of liquid N-methylacetamide and its water solutions at temperatures of 305 and 350 K. The pre-peak in the spectrum shows a shift with an increase in the temperature or N-methylacetamide concentration. The effect is reproduced by our classical molecular dynamics simulations and subsequent spectrum calculations using density functional theory. We apply a data-driven method, emulator-based component analysis, to the computational data to identify the decisive structural degrees of freedom behind spectral variation. This representation in reduced dimensions accounts for the involved loss of structural information and reveals that the effect is indicative of weakening of the hydrogen bonds.

Cocatalysts play an important role in the field of photocatalysis by providing active sites and reducing reaction barriers to increase the reaction rates. However, efficient cocatalysts usually contain expensive noble metals, such as platinum. It is thus of great significance for practical applications in developing low-cost cocatalysts in photocatalysis. In this contribution, we reported a new cocatalyst nickel thiocarbonate (NiCS3) of ZnIn2S4 photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It was found that the hydrogen production rate of the NiCS3/ZnIn2S4 composite can reach 15.4 mmol·h-1·g-1 under visible light when NiCS3 is composited with ZnIn2S4, which is more than three times that of the HER performance of ZnIn2S4 alone. The theoretical calculations suggested that the improvement of HER performance is rooted in the built-in electric fields in the NiCS3/ZnIn2S4 composite. The abundant Ni active sites in the NiCS3/ZnIn2S4 composite not only promote the separation and migration of photoinduced carriers but also allow a suitable Gibbs free energy of adsorbed H* (ΔGH*). This study indicated that NiCS3 has great potential to replace noble metals as a promising cocatalyst of ZnIn2S4 for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Abstract Developing efficient and sustainable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing energy conversion and storage technologies. 3d transition‐metal (oxy)hydroxides and spinel‐type oxides have emerged as promising candidates due to their structural flexibility, oxygen redox activity, and abundance in earth's crust. However, their OER performance can be changed dynamically during the reaction due to surface reconstruction and transformation. Essentially, multiple elementary processes occur simultaneously, whereby the electrocatalyst surfaces undergo substantial changes during OER. A better understanding of these elementary processes and how they affect the electrocatalytic performance is essential for the OER electrocatalyst design. This review aims to critically assess these processes, including oxidation, surface amorphization, transformation, cation dissolution, redeposition, and facet and electrolyte effects on the OER performance. The review begins with an overview of the electrocatalysts’ structure, redox couples, and common issues associated with electrochemical measurements of 3d transition‐metal (oxy)hydroxides and spinels, followed by recent advancements in understanding the elementary processes involved in OER. The challenges and new perspectives are presented at last, potentially shedding light on advancing the rational design of next‐generation OER electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion and storage applications.

Two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in the 2H or 1T crystal phases, are promising (electro)catalyst candidates due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and composition of low-cost, abundant elements. While the edges of elemental TMDC nanoparticles, such as MoS2, can show significant catalytic activity, the basal plane of the pristine materials is notoriously inert, which limits their normalized activity. Here, we show that high densities of catalytically active sites can be formed on the TMDC basal plane by alloying elements that prefer the 2H (1T) phase into a 1T (2H) structure. The global stability of the alloy, in particular, whether it crystallizes in the 2H or 1T phase, can be controlled by ensuring a majority of elements prefer the target phase. We further show that the mixing entropy plays a decisive role in stabilizing the alloy, implying that high-entropy alloying becomes essential. Our calculations point to a number of interesting nonprecious hydrogen evolution catalysts, including (CrTaVHfZr)S2 and (CrNbVTiZr)S2 in the 1T-phase and (MoNbTaVTi)S2 in the 2H-phase. Our work opens new directions for designing catalytic sites via high-entropy alloy stabilization of locally unstable structures.
