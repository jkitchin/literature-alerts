Abstract Perovskite oxides are considered highly promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to their low cost and adaptable electronic structure. However, modulating the electronic structure of catalysts without altering their nanomorphology is crucial for understanding the structure‐property relationship. In this study, a simple plasma bombardment strategy is developed to optimize the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides. Experimental characterization of plasma‐treated LaCo 0.9 Fe 0.1 O 3 (P‐LCFO) reveals abundant oxygen vacancies, which expose numerous active sites. Additionally, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X‐ray absorption fine structure analyses indicate a low Co valence state in P‐LCFO, likely due to the presence of these oxygen vacancies, which contributes to an optimized electronic structure that enhances OER performance. Consequently, P‐LCFO exhibits significantly improved OER catalytic activity, with a low overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , outperforming commercial RuO 2 . This work underscores the benefits of plasma engineering for studying structure‐property relationships and developing highly active perovskite oxide catalysts for water splitting.

Lewis acid sites (LAS) at the CHA(001) and CHA(101) surfaces are investigated regarding their activity for MeOH-mediated hydrogen transfer reactions from MeOH to alkenes, yielding alkanes and formaldehyde. Direct MeOH decomposition to formaldehyde and hydrogen is also investigated. Furthermore, the coupling of the produced olefins with formaldehyde to dienes and H2O via the Prins reaction is studied. The reactivity of LAS for these reactions is compared to that of bulk Brønsted acid sites (BAS) and surface BAS. Periodic density functional theory (DFT) is used in connection with DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations on cluster models. Hydrogen transfer reactions are found to be often more favorable on LAS, while both LAS and BAS have similar activity for Prins reactions.

The lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) battery, renowned for its exceptionally high theoretical energy density, is poised to revolutionize next-generation energy storage systems. However, its practical application depends on overcoming several challenges, particularly the high cathode overpotential, which significantly diminishes the battery's energy efficiency and durability. This study delves into the interactions at the cathode surface during oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER), extending the analysis beyond the initial reaction stages to encompass the extensive charge–discharge process. We introduce and define the concepts of intrinsic equilibrium potential and intrinsic overpotential, demonstrating that these critical parameters are predominantly influenced by the growth of discharge products, rather than the catalysts, thereby underscoring the inherent properties of the battery. This shift in focus from merely enhancing cathode catalysts to understanding and leveraging the intrinsic characteristics of the battery discharge process opens new avenues for optimizing and enhancing the performance of large-scale Li–O2 batteries. Furthermore, our findings indicate potential broader applications to other metal–oxygen systems, paving the way for the design of high-capacity, high-efficiency energy storage technologies.

The treatment of highly concentrated and recalcitrant organic pollutants in industrial wastewater has garnered significant attention, with Fenton oxidation emerging as a promising approach. However, traditional iron-based Fenton reagents present certain limitations, and copper-based Fenton systems are often less efficient. Thus, it is necessary to develop innovative copper-based Fenton catalytic materials. In this study, Cu₂O and Ag-modified activated carbon fibers (Cu₂O-Ag@ACF) were synthesized via liquid-phase reduction. The composition, structure, and morphology of Cu₂O-Ag@ACF were systematically characterized. The Cu₂O-Ag@ACF was employed as a functionalized cathode in the electro-Fenton process to degrade a highly concentrated organic pollutant solution, with methylene blue serving as a model contaminant. The loading of Cu₂O and Ag not only enhances the electrochemical performance of ACF but also improves its Fenton oxidation efficiency. Cu₂O-Ag@ACF exhibitd less than 1% performance degradation after five cycles of use, highlighting its potential for industrial applications under simulated realistic conditions. Moreover, the electro-Fenton system parameters, including current density, pH, electrode spacing, and solution temperature, were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the degradation rate of methylene blue by Cu₂O-Ag@ACF reached 92.8% within 120 minutes. Kinetic analysis indicated that the reaction followed a first-order kinetic model, with a rate constant of 0.253 min⁻¹. Furthermore, this study revealed that trace silver doping significantly accelerated the generation of reactive oxygen species, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the Cu-based Fenton-like catalysts. In conclusion, this work presents a convenient strategy for the sustainable and efficient purification of industrial wastewater, contributing to the improvement of human life quality.

The bigger pictureChallenges and opportunities:•The scarcity of active sites limits the large-scale application of metal oxides as commercial oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. However, the rational design of defect structures can boost their catalytic activity•The precise design of catalyst defect structures requires a comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationship between defects and OER performance. Current research primarily focuses on the correlation between defects and thermodynamic parameters. However, our understanding of the intrinsic relationship between defects and the kinetics and mechanisms of OERs remains limited•In the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), defect structures can accelerate the evolution of active surfaces, promote OH⁻ adsorption and deprotonation, and facilitate the desorption of the product O₂. In the lattice oxygen intermediate mechanism (LOM), defect structures can enhance the covalency of metal–oxygen bonds and provide OH⁻ adsorption sites, facilitating their involvement in lattice oxygen oxidation processesSummaryThe development of electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis for hydrogen production and rechargeable metal-air batteries, offers promising solutions to the energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, challenges like sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and scarce active sites in transition metal oxides hinder large-scale commercial applications. Defect engineering has emerged as a promising strategy to optimize transition metal oxides by improving their electronic structure, conductivity, and active site availability. Early research focused on static thermodynamic parameters, such as impedance, overpotential, and band gap, neglecting dynamic factors like catalyst surface restructuring and mechanism transformation during reactions. This perspective highlights the intrinsic connection between defect structures, catalyst surface reconstruction, and reaction mechanisms. It also discusses the need for advanced experimental and theoretical computational studies to better understand the surface evolution of catalysts during OERs.Graphical abstract    

    

## Addressing accuracy by prescribing precision: Bayesian error estimation of point defect energetics

With density functional theory (DFT), it is possible to calculate the formation energy of charged point defects and in turn to predict a range of experimentally relevant quantities, such as defect concentrations, charge transition levels, or recombination rates. While prior efforts have led to marked improvements in the accuracy of such calculations, comparatively modest effort has been directed at quantifying their uncertainties. However, in the broader DFT research space, the development of Bayesian Error Estimation Functionals (BEEF) has enabled uncertainty quantification (UQ) for other properties. In this paper, we investigate the utility of BEEF as a tool for UQ of defect formation energies. We build a pipeline for propagating BEEF energies through a formation-energy calculation and test it on intrinsic defects in several materials systems spanning a variety of chemistries, bandgaps, and crystal structures, comparing to prior published results where available. We also assess the impact of aligning to a deep-level transition rather than to the VBM (valence band maximum). We observe negligible dependence of the estimated uncertainty upon a supercell size, though the relationship may be obfuscated by the fact that finite-size corrections cannot be computed separately for each member of the BEEF ensemble. Additionally, we find an increase in estimated uncertainty with respect to the absolute charge of a defect and the relaxation around the defect site without deep-level alignment, but this trend is absent when the alignment is applied. While further investigation is warranted, our results suggest that BEEF could be a useful method for UQ in defect calculations.

The design of small molecules is crucial for technological applications ranging from drug discovery to energy storage. Due to the vast design space available to modern synthetic chemistry, the community has increasingly sought to use data-driven and machine learning approaches to navigate this space. Although generative machine learning methods have recently shown potential for computational molecular design, their use is hindered by complex training procedures, and they often fail to generate valid and unique molecules. In this context, pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for molecular design, as they appear to be capable of creating and modifying molecules based on simple instructions provided through natural language prompts. In this work, we show that the Claude 3 Opus LLM can read, write, and modify molecules according to prompts, with impressive 97% valid and unique molecules. By quantifying these modifications in a low-dimensional latent space, we systematically evaluate the model's behavior under different prompting conditions. Notably, the model is able to perform guided molecular generation when asked to manipulate the electronic structure of molecules using simple, natural-language prompts. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs as powerful and versatile molecular design engines.

We theoretically identify the ScSeI monolayer as a promising new 2D material for photocatalysis through first-principles calculations. The most notable feature is the significant difference in carrier mobility, with electron mobility in the horizontal direction being 20.66 times higher than hole mobility, minimizing electron-hole recombination. The ScSeI monolayer exhibits a bandgap of 2.51 eV, with the valence band maximum at -6.37 eV and the conduction band minimum at -3.86 eV, meeting the requirements for water splitting. Phosphorus doping lowers the Gibbs free energy by 1.63 eV, enhancing the catalytic activity. The ScSeI monolayer achieves a hydrogen production efficiency of 17%, surpassing the commercial threshold of 10% and shows excellent mechanical, thermal, and dynamic stability, indicating feasibility for experimental synthesis and practical application. Additionally, the monolayer maintains its photocatalytic properties under tensile strain (-6% to 6%) and in aqueous environments, reinforcing its potential as an effective photocatalyst. Based on these findings, we believe the ScSeI monolayer is a highly promising photocatalyst.

Ferroelectric semiconductors hold great promise in the field of photocatalysis due to their spontaneous polarization that can suppress the recombination of photogenerated charges, but the mechanism of the effect of ferroelectric polarization and the intensity of polarization on surface catalytic reactions have never been approached. Here, we have comparatively investigated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic process on surfaces in polarized and unpolarized orientations of the intrinsic ferroelectric semiconductor β-CuGaO

We have examined the case of light atom (B, N) doped and co-doped graphitic films grown on copper for the anode-free Li Metal Battery (AFLMB) application. For nitrogen doping, the depositions were carried out by laser ablating pure graphite (Gr) in the presence of Nitrogen (N2) or Ammonia (NH3). In another interesting case, 5 wt. % Boron nitride (BN) was added into the graphite target itself to obtain BN-doped graphite films. It was found that the growth condition mediated film constitution and properties significantly influence the Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability of the cells when tested for AFLMB. The cycle life demonstrated by the cells of pure graphitic film (Gr) was only about 110 cycles, while the N-doped graphite films obtained using N2 gas (N2–Gr) exhibited stability up to about 300 cycles. Interestingly the N-doped films obtained using NH3 gas (NH3–Gr) exhibited a stability of 715 cycles and B, N co-doped graphite (BN–Gr) film resulted in an even longer cycle life of 795 cycles. Density functional theory calculations were also performed to deeply understand the interaction and binding energy of Lithium within the undoped and doped graphene sheets modeled through the addition of light elements. It was found that the binding of Li is stronger in the (B, N) co-doped graphene as compared to the N-doped graphene and undoped graphene but much weaker than the B-doped graphene. Therefore, an improved lateral Li diffusion in the (B, N) co-doped graphene is observed where the Li binding strength is optimum resulting in better cycling stability.

Abstract In this study, we developed and parametrized a friction model for finite element (FE) cutting simulations of AISI4140 steel, combining experimental data and numerical simulations at various scales. Given the severe thermomechanical loads during cutting, parametrization of friction models based on analogous experiments has been proven difficult, such that the cutting process itself is often used for calibration. Instead, our model is based on the real area of contact between rough surfaces and the stress required to shear adhesive micro contacts. We utilized microtextured cutting tools and their negative imprint on chips to orient chip and tool surfaces, enabling the determination of a combined surface roughness. This effective roughness was then applied in contact mechanics calculations using a penetration hardness model informed by indentation hardness measurements. Consistent with Bowden and Tabor theory, we observed that the fractional contact area increased linearly with the applied normal load, and the effective roughness remained insensitive to cutting fluid application. Additionally, we calculated the required shear stress as a function of normal load using DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations for a tribofilm formed at the interface, with its composition inferred from ex-situ XPS depth profiling of the cutting tools. Our friction model demonstrated good agreement with experimental results in two-dimensional FE chip forming simulations of orthogonal cutting processes, evaluated by means of cutting force, passive force, and contact length prediction. This work presents a proof of concept for a physics-based approach to calibrate constitutive models in metal cutting, potentially advancing the use of multiscale and multiphysical simulations in machining.

Abstract Defect engineering is a powerful strategy for enhancing the catalytic properties of monolayer VSe 2 . In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the impact of point defects and hydrogen adsorption sites on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of VSe 2 . We analyzed the formation energies and hydrogen adsorption behavior of single and double vacancies in VSe 2 . The results show that V vacancy defect (D2), consecutive V-Se double vacancy defect (D3), and separate V-Se double defect (D4) exhibit the enhanced HER activity with Gibbs free energies (Δ G H * = 0.04 eV, 0.04 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively) even surpassing that of platinum (Δ G H * = − 0.1 eV). This study highlights the potential of defect-engineered VSe 2 for efficient hydrogen evolution.

In electrochemical experiments, the number of electrons of the electrode immersed in the electrolyte is usually variable. Additionally, the numbers of adsorbed substances on the surface of the electrode, the solvent molecules, and counter charge ions in the near-surface region can also vary. Treating electrochemical solid-liquid interfaces with the typical fixed electron number density functional theory (DFT) approach tends to be a challenge. This can be addressed by using grand canonical ensemble approaches. We present the implementation of two grand canonical ensemble approaches in the open-source computational chemistry software CP2K that go beyond the existing canonical ensemble paradigm. The first approach is based on implicit solvent models and explicit atomistic solute (electrode with/without adsorbed species) models, and includes two recent developments: (a) grand canonical self-consistent field (GC-SCF) method (

We perform first-principles density functional calculations to elucidate structural, electronic, and magnetic properties at the interface of (0001)Cr2O3−(111)Pt bilayers. This investigation is motivated by the fact that, despite the promise of Cr2O3−Pt heterostructures in a variety of antiferromagnetic spintronic applications, many key structural, electronic, and magnetic properties at the Cr2O3−Pt interface are poorly understood. We first analyze all inequivalent lateral interface alignments to determine the lowest energy interfacial structure. For all lateral alignments including the lowest energy one, we observe an accumulation of electrons at the interface between Cr2O3 and Pt. We find an unexpected reversal of the magnetic moments of the interface Cr ions in the presence of Pt compared to surface Cr moments in vacuum-terminated (0001)Cr2O3. We also find that the heterostructure exhibits a magnetic proximity effect in the first three Pt layers at the interface with Cr2O3, providing a mechanism by which the anomalous Hall effect can occur in (0001)Cr2O3−(111)Pt bilayers. Our results provide the basis for a more nuanced interpretation of magnetotransport experiments on (0001)Cr2O3−(111)Pt bilayers and should inform future development of improved antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on the Cr2O3−Pt material system.

Abstract Efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts play a pivotal role in water electrolysis, notably for industrial high current densities (>1000 mA cm −2 ). Crystalline/amorphous heterostructure interfaces have proven to be advantageous for enhancing the OER activities of electrocatalytic materials. However, the constructing and tailoring for crystalline/amorphous interfaces still remain a great challenge due to the destruction of active substrates by intricate post‐treatment. Here, a strategy to tailor nanocrystalline/amorphous (N/A) interface and optimize the electrocatalytic performance of as‐cast N/A alloys by adjusting the size of nanocrystals is proposed. The N/A alloy fibers obtained based on this strategy exhibit superior OER performance with an overpotential of 227 mV (@10 mA cm −2 ), maintaining stability for over 1000, 600, and 240 h under high current densities of 500, 1000, and 1800 mA cm −2 , respectively. Theoretical calculations and material characterizations reveal that N/A interfaces, facilitated by appropriately sized nanocrystals possessing a loose atomic arrangement, favorable surface electronic structure, advantageous local coordination, and optimal O‐contained intermediate adsorption, can yield abundant active sites without compromising stability. This study not only provides a deeper understanding of the tailoring mechanism of N/A interfaces but also offers a new design perspective for the development of cost‐effective, industrial‐grade electrocatalysts.

Abstract Machine learned chemical potentials have shown great promise as alternatives to conventional computational chemistry methods to represent the potential energy of a given atomic or molecular system as a function of its geometry. However, such potentials are only as good as the data they are trained on, and building a comprehensive training set can be a costly process. Therefore, it is important to extract as much information from training data as possible without further increasing the computational cost. One way to accomplish this is by training on molecular forces in addition to energies. This allows for three additional labels per atom within the molecule. Here we develop a neural network potential energy surface for studying a hydrogen transfer reaction between two isomers of . We show that, for a much smaller training set, force training not only improves the accuracy of the model compared to only training on energies, but also provides more accurate and smoother first and second derivatives that are crucial to run dynamics and extract vibrational frequencies in the context of transition‐state theory. We also demonstrate the importance of choosing the proper force to energy weight ratio for the loss function to minimize the model test error.

Exploring potential energy surfaces (PES) is essential for unraveling the underlying mechanisms of chemical reactions and material properties. While the activation-relaxation technique (ARTn) is a state-of-the-art method for identifying saddle points on PES, it often faces challenges in complex energy landscapes, especially on surfaces. In this study, we introduce iso-ARTn, an enhanced ARTn method that incorporates constraints on an orthogonal hyperplane and employs an adaptive active volume. By leveraging a neural network potential (NNP) to conduct an exhaustive saddle point search on the Pt(111) surface with 0.3 monolayers of surface oxygen coverage, iso-ARTn achieves a success rate that is 8.2% higher than the original ARTn, with 40% fewer force calls. Moreover, this method effectively finds various saddle points without compromising the success rate. Combined with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for event table construction, iso-ARTn with NNP demonstrates the capability to reveal structures consistent with experimental observations. This work signifies a substantial advancement in the investigation of PES, enhancing both the efficiency and breadth of saddle point searches.

Cryogenic ion vibrational predissociation (CIVP) spectroscopy is an established and valuable technique for molecular elucidation in the gas phase. CIVP relies on tunable lasers, wherein among typical laser schemes, the application of mid-infrared continuous-wave quantum cascade laser (cw-QCL) is the most robust and elegant solution, as we have recently demonstrated. However, potential challenges arise from an inhomogeneous character across laser power tuning curves. A large laser power output could have undesired consequences, such as multiphoton absorption or saturation effects. Significant variations in laser power tuning curves could potentially alter the shape of the investigated band, particularly for diffuse bands. In this study, we have developed and introduced an automatic variable laser power attenuator designed to keep the laser power output uniform at a user-defined value across the entire available spectral range. We demonstrated the application of this attenuator in obtaining CIVP spectra of a model compound with a diffuse N–H–N band. This approach enhances the reliability of measuring diffuse bands and overall applicability of cw-QCL.

Abstract Improving control over active‐site reactivity is a grand challenge in catalysis. Single‐atom alloys (SAAs) consisting of a reactive component doped as single atoms into a more inert host metal feature localized and well‐defined active sites, but fine tuning their properties is challenging. Here, a framework is developed for tuning single‐atom site reactivity by alloying in an additional inert metal, which this work terms an alloy‐host SAA. Specifically, this work creates about 5% Pd single‐atom sites in a Pd 33 Ag 67 (111) single crystal surface, and then identifies Sn based on computational screening as a suitable third metal to introduce. Subsequent experimental studies show that introducing Sn indeed modifies the electronic structure and chemical reactivity (measured by CO desorption energies) of the Pd sites. The modifications to both the electronic structure and the CO adsorption energies are in close agreement with the calculations. These results indicate that the use of an alloy host environment to modify the reactivity of single‐atom sites can allow fine‐tuning of catalytic performance and boost resistance against strong‐binding adsorbates such as CO.

Palladium (Pd) and its alloys, renowned for their good corrosion resistance, catalytic efficiency, and hydrogen affinity, find extensive use in various industrial applications. However, the susceptibility of pure Pd to hydrogen embrittlement necessitates alloying strategies such as Pd-Ag systems. This study investigates the impact of the ordering on the phase stability and elastic properties of Pd-Ag alloys through first-principles calculations. We explore a series of ordered phase structures alongside random solid solutions using Special Quasirandom Structures (SQSs), evaluating their thermodynamic stability and elastic properties. Our findings indicate the possible existence of stable ordered L12 Pd3Ag and PdAg3 and L11 PdAg phases, which are thought to exist only in Cu-Pt alloys. An analysis of the elastic constants and anisotropy indices underscores some pronounced directional dependencies in the mechanical responses between the random solid-solution and ordered phases. This suggests that the ordered phases not only are thermodynamically and mechanically more stable than solid-solution phases, but also display a decrease in anisotropy indices. The results provide a deeper understanding of the atomic behavior of Pd-Ag alloys, and shed light on the design of multiphase Pd-Ag alloys to improve their mechanical properties.

Abstract Regulating the adsorption of an intermediate on an electrocatalyst by manipulating the electron spin state of the transition metal is of great significance for promoting the activation of inert nitrogen molecules (N 2 ) during the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR). However, achieving this remains challenging. Herein, a novel 2D/2D Mott–Schottky heterojunction, Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P, is developed as an eNRR catalyst. This is achieved through the in situ growth of cobalt sulfide (Co 9 S 8 ) nanosheets over a Nb 2 CT x MXene using a solution plasma modification method. Transformation of the Co spin state from low (t 2g 6 e g 1 ) to high (t 2g 5 e g 2 ) is achieved by adjusting the interface electronic structure and sulfur vacancy of Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P. The adsorption ability of N 2 is optimized through high spin Co(II) with more unpaired electrons, significantly accelerating the *N 2 →*NNH kinetic process. The Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P exhibits a high NH 3 yield of 62.62 µg h −1 mg cat. −1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 30.33% at −0.40 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m HCl. Additionally, it achieves an NH 3 yield of 41.47 µg h −1 mg cat. −1 and FE of 23.19% at −0.60 V versus RHE in 0.1 m Na 2 SO 4 . This work demonstrates a promising strategy for constructing heterojunction electrocatalysts for efficient eNRR.
