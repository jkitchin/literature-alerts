As the anode reaction of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main obstacles to the practical application of PEMWE due to its sluggish four-electron transfer process. The development of high-performance acidic OER electrocatalysts has become the key to improving the reaction kinetics. To date, although various excellent acidic OER electrocatalysts have been widely researched, Ir-based nanomaterials are still state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Hence, a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of Ir-based electrocatalysts is crucial for the precise optimization of catalytic performance. In this review, the origin and nature of the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the derived volcanic relationship on Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER processes are summarized and some optimization strategies for Ir-based electrocatalysts based on the AEM are introduced. To further investigate the development strategy of high-performance Ir-based electrocatalysts, several unconventional OER mechanisms including dual-site mechanism and lattice oxygen mediated mechanism, and their applications are introduced in detail. Thereafter, the active species on Ir-based electrocatalysts at acidic OER are summarized and classified into surface Ir species and O species. Finally, the future development direction and prospect of Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER are put forward.

The bulk properties and surface chemical reactivity of compositionally disordered Pt–Fe and Pt–Co alloys in the fcc A1 phase have been investigated theoretically in comparison to the ordered alloys of the same compositions. The results are analyzed together with our previously reported findings for Pt–Ni. Nonlinear variation is observed in lattice constant, d band center, magnetic moment, and hydrogen adsorption energy across the composition range (0–100 atomic % of Pt, xPt). The Pt 5d states are strongly perturbed by the 3d states of the base metals, leading to notable density of states above the Fermi level and residual magnetic moments at high xPt. Surface reactivity in terms of average H adsorption energy varies continuously with composition between the monometallic Fe–Pt and Co–Pt limits, going through a maximum around xPt = 0.5–0.75. Close inspection reveals a significant variation in site reactivity at xPt < 0.75, particularly with disordered Pt–Fe alloys due in part to the inherent disparity in chemical reactivity between Fe and Pt. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Fe and Pt causes Pt-rich sites to be less reactive toward H than Pt-rich sites on disordered Pt–Ni alloy surfaces, despite less compressive strain caused. These results provide theoretical underpinnings for conceptualizing and understanding the performance of these Pt-base metal alloys in key catalytic applications and for efforts to tailor Pt-alloys as catalysts.

High-entropy alloys (HEAs), characterized as compositionally complex solid solutions with five or more metal elements, have emerged as a novel class of catalytic materials with unique attributes. Because of the remarkable diversity of multielement sites or site ensembles stabilized by configurational entropy, human exploration of the multidimensional design space of HEAs presents a formidable challenge, necessitating an efficient, computational and data-driven strategy over traditional trial-and-error experimentation or physics-based modeling. Leveraging deep learning interatomic potentials for large-scale molecular simulations and pretrained machine learning models of surface reactivity, our approach effectively rationalizes the enhanced activity of a previously synthesized PdCuPtNiCo HEA nanoparticle system for electrochemical oxygen reduction, as corroborated by experimental observations. We contend that this framework deepens our fundamental understanding of the surface reactivity of high-entropy materials and fosters the accelerated development and synthesis of monodisperse HEA nanoparticles as a versatile material platform for catalyzing sustainable chemical and energy transformations.

Reaction intermediates buried within a solid-liquid interface are difficult targets for physiochemical measurements. They are inherently molecular and locally dynamic, while their surroundings are extended by a periodic lattice on one side and the solvent dielectric on the other. Challenges compound on a metal-oxide surface of varied sites and especially so at its aqueous interface of many prominent reactions. Recently, phenomenological theory coupled with optical spectroscopy has become a more prominent tool for isolating the intermediates and their molecular dynamics.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important chemical with a diverse range of industrial applications in chemical synthesis and medical disinfection. The traditional anthraquinone oxidation process, with high energy consumption and complexity, is being replaced by cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. In order to explore suitable catalysts for the electrocatalytic synthesis of H2O2, the stability of B,N-doped graphene loaded with various p-block metal (PM) single atoms (i.e., PM-NxBy: x and y represent the number of atoms of N and B, respectively) and the effects of different numbers and positions of B dopants in the second coordination shell on the catalytic performance were studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that Ga-N4B6 and Sb-N4B6 exhibit enhanced stability and 2e− oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and selectivity. Their thermodynamic overpotential η values are 0.01 V, 0.03 V for Ga-N4B6’s two configurations and 0.02 V, 0 V for Sb-N4B6’s two configurations. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the PM single atom adsorbs OOH* intermediates and transfers electrons into them, resulting in the activation of the O-O bond, which facilitates the subsequent hydrogenation reaction. In summary, Sb-N4B6 and Ga-N4B6 exhibit extraordinary 2e− ORR performance, and their predicted activities are comparable to those of known outstanding catalysts (such as PtHg4 alloy). We propose effective strategies on how to enhance the 2e− ORR activities of carbon materials, elucidate the origin of the activity of potential catalysts, and provide insights for the design and development of electrocatalysts that can be used for H2O2 production.

Abstract Fe 3 O 4 is barely taken into account as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), an important reaction for metal—air batteries and fuel cells, due to its sluggish catalytic kinetics and poor electron conductivity. Herein, how strain engineering can be employed to regulate the local electronic structure of Fe 3 O 4 for high ORR activity is reported. Compressively strained Fe 3 O 4 shells with 2.0% shortened Fe─O bond are gained on the Fe/Fe 4 N cores as a result of lattice mismatch at the interface. A downshift of the d‐band center occurs for compressed Fe 3 O 4 , leading to weakened chemisorption energy of oxygenated intermediates, and lower reaction overpotential. The compressed Fe 3 O 4 exhibits greatly enhanced electrocatalytic ORR activity with a kinetic current density of 27 times higher than that of pristine one at 0.80 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), as well as potential application in zinc‐air batteries. The findings provide a new strategy for tuning electronic structures and improving the catalytic activity of other metal catalysts.

Abstract Atomic Ag cluster bonding is employed to reinforce the interface between PF3T nano‐cluster and TiO 2 nanoparticle. With an optimized Ag loading (Ag/TiO 2 = 0.5 wt%), the Ag atoms will uniformly disperse on TiO 2 thus generating a high density of intermediate states in the band gap to form the electron channel between the terthiophene group of PF3T and the TiO 2 in the hybrid composite (denoted as T@Ag05‐P). The former expands the photon absorption band width and the latter facilitates the core‐hole splitting by injecting the photon excited electron (from the excitons in PF3T) into the conduction band (CB) of TiO 2 . These characteristics enable the high efficiency of H 2 production to 16 580 µmol h −1 g −1 and photocatalysis stability without degradation under visible light exposure for 96 h. Compared to that of hybrid material without Ag bonding (TiO 2 @PF3T), the H 2 production yield and stability are improved by 4.1 and 18.2‐fold which shows the best performance among existing materials in similar component combination and interfacial reinforcement. The unique bonding method offers a new prospect to accelerate the development of photocatalytic hydrogen production technologies.

Abstract The development of deposition processes for metal carbide thin films is rapidly advancing, driven by their potential for applications including catalysis, batteries, and semiconductor devices. Within this landscape, atomic layer deposition (ALD) offers exceptional conformality, uniformity, and thickness control on spatially complex structures. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the thermal ALD of MoC x with MoCl 5 and 1,4‐bis(trimethylgermyl)‐1,4‐dihydropyrazine [(Me 3 Ge) 2 DHP] as precursors, focusing on the functional properties and characterization of the films. The depositions are conducted at 200–300 °C and very smooth films with RMS Rq ≈0.3–0.6 nm on Si, TiN, and HfO 2 substrates are obtained. The process has a high growth rate of 1.5 Å cycle −1 and the films appear to be continuous already after 5 cycles. The films are conductive even at thicknesses below 5 nm, and films above 18 nm exhibit superconductivity up to 4.4 K. In lieu of suitable references, Raman modes for molybdenum carbides and nitrides are calculated and X‐ray diffraction and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used for phase analysis.

Abstract The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a key process for the energy transition. Transition metal atoms atomically dispersed on a solid support represent a promising approach to the design of new catalytic materials. The interest for single‐ (SACs) and dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) is steadily growing. In general, DACs are considered more active than SACs for NRR. In this work, the complex chemistry behind NRR is investigated on a set of SACs and DACs by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that self‐interaction corrected exchange‐correlation functionals must be adopted, at variance with several studies in the literature. Furthermore, it is not possible to extrapolate results obtained on conventional extended catalytic surfaces to SACs and DACs, due to a richer scenario of possible reaction paths. In general, the results show a positive effect on the catalytic activity moving from 3d to 5d metals, and from SACs and DACs. However, if the two effects work together, that is, 5d metals in DACs, the reaction intermediates may be too strongly bound, thus resulting in reduced catalytic activity. In this respect, the fact that DACs are expected to be superior to SACs in NRR is not always verified.

Abstract Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to their 100% atomic utilization efficiency. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO using SAC offers a promising approach for CO2 utilization, but achieving facile CO2 adsorption and CO desorption remains challenging for traditional SACs. Instead of singling out specific atoms, we propose a novel strategy utilizing atoms from the entire lanthanide (Ln) group to facilitate the CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations, operando spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate the bridging adsorption mechanism for a representative erbium (Er) single-atom catalyst. Remarkably, we realize a series of Ln SACs spanning 14 elements that exhibit CO Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. The Er catalyst achieves an ultrahigh turnover frequency of ~ 130,000 h‒1, accompanying with a remarkable 42.6% full-cell energy efficiency and record-high 94% single-pass CO2 conversion efficiency. This unparalleled catalytic platform leverages the collective potential of the lanthanide group, introducing new possibilities for efficient CO2-to-CO conversion and beyond through the exploration of unique bonding motifs in single-atom catalysts.

Green and highly selective synthesis of ammonia (NH 3 ) via electrochemical reduction reaction of toxic nitrite (NO 2 − RR) in a neutral electrolyte is a feasible solution for energy and environmental issues. Dual‐nature electrocatalysts combining metal and metal‐derived materials are crucial for enhancing the selectivity parameter and efficacy of this reaction. Here, Pd‐, Pt‐, Ru‐, and Ir‐decorated Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2 (CoPi) composites with a robust metal–support interaction are obtained via the one‐pot pulsed laser ablation in liquid method. Among the designed composites, Ir–CoPi affords ≈100% Faradaic efficiency, mass balance, and selectivity toward NH 3 product at sufficiently low potentials. Further, it affords the highest NH 3 yield rate of 19.13 mg h −1 cm −2 with 78.1% removal of toxic NO 2 − with a rate constant k app = 0.31 m m min −1 under −1.6 V versus Ag/AgCl. In situ experiments and theoretical investigations reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for this outstanding performance of Ir–CoPi, which can be accredited to the generation of specific active sites on the Ir component. Insights derived from the evolving intermediate reactive species provide new opportunities for large‐scale NH 3 production through electrochemical techniques, density functional theory calculations, and the improvement of the corresponding industrial processes.

Abstract Hydrogen production through water electrolysis is a viable method to reduce reliance on conventional energy sources. Nonetheless, water electrolysis necessitates using effective electrocatalysts to enhance the efficiency of converting electrical energy into chemical energy. Compared with the high cost of platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru)‐based materials show significant promise as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Ru cluster supported on a nitrogen‐doped carbon substrate containing an atomically dispersed nickel electrocatalyst is synthesized (NiRu‐NC). In NiRu‐NC electrocatalyst, Ru clusters act as primary active sites, while atomically dispersed Ni atoms act as auxiliary sites. The HER activity of Ru clusters is enhanced by modifying the electronic structure of Ru sites. This unique structure enhances the interaction between the Ru cluster and the substrate, showing excellent HER performance in an alkaline environment. The overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 is only 25 mV, and the Tafel slope is 29 mV dec −1 . In continuous operation for 24 h, the overpotential value hardly rose, indicating exemplary stability behavior of the applied NiRu‐NC electrocatalyst.

Abstract Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) was penta‐coordinated with pyridine ligand (Py) grafted on carbon nanotube (CNT), to form (FePc‐Py‐CNT). The complex was studied as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction ORR in seven different supporting electrolytes: OH − (0.1 M), OH − (1 M), NO 3 − (1 M), HSO 4 − (1 M), ClO 4 − (1 M), Br − (1 M), Cl − (1 M), to unveil anion‐poisoning effects and mechanism. Through cyclic voltammetry and polarization curves in N 2 and O 2 saturated atmospheres, thermodynamic and kinetic data were acquired. In acid media, the formal potential Fe(III)/(II) ( E 0’ Fe(III)/(II) ) of the complex is biased to more negative potentials by the anion presence. Similar effects were observed for the onset potential ( E onset ) during polarization curves for the ORR. When the ORR was performed in the presence of either ClO 4 − , or HSO 4 − , anions, Tafel analysis showed different values depending if were derived from the low or from the high overpotential regions, revealing an inner‐sphere electron transfer mechanism (ISET). The Tafel values derived from measurements in the presence of Cl − and Br − anions do not change when extracted at low or at high overpotentials evidencing an outer‐sphere reaction mechanism (OSET). Gibbs free energies were derived from poisoning tests confirming the ISET and OSET mechanisms. The poisoning effect is responsible for the immediate loss of performance for these catalysts during the ORR in acidic media.

Presently, there is a significant focus on the investigation and advancement of polymer-modified asphalt that is both high-performing and environmentally sustainable. This study thoroughly examined the performance and modification mechanism of gutta-percha (GP) as a novel asphalt modifier. The investigation was conducted using a combination of macro- and microscopic testing, as well as molecular dynamics simulations. This work primarily examined the compatibility of GP with asphalt molecular modeling. This paper used molecular dynamics to identify the most suitable mixing temperature. Next, the gray correlation theory was used to discuss the most effective method for preparing gutta-percha-modified asphalt (GPMA). The macro-rheological tests and microscopic performance analysis provided a full understanding of the impact of GP on asphalt properties and the process of alteration. The findings indicate that eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) exhibits good compatibility with asphalt, while sulfur-vulcanized eucommia ulmoides gum (SEUG) does not demonstrate compatibility with asphalt. Both EUG and SEUG enhance the thermal stability and resistance to deformation of asphalt at high temperatures, with SEUG having a particularly notable effect. However, both additives do not improve the resistance of asphalt to cracking at low temperatures. The manufacturing method for EUG-modified asphalt (EUGMA) involves physical mixing, whereas sulfur-vulcanized eucommia ulmoides gum-modified asphalt (SEUGMA) involves physical mixing together with certain chemical processes. This research establishes a theoretical foundation for the advancement of GP as a novel environmentally friendly and highly effective asphalt modification.

In the past two decades, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have driven significant developments in chemical, biological, and material sciences. The construction and training of MLPs enable fast and accurate simulations and analysis of thermodynamic and kinetic properties. This review focuses on the application of MLPs to reaction systems with consideration of bond breaking and formation. We review the development of MLP models, primarily with neural network and kernel-based algorithms, and recent applications of reactive MLPs (RMLPs) to systems at different scales. We show how RMLPs are constructed, how they speed up the calculation of reactive dynamics, and how they facilitate the study of reaction trajectories, reaction rates, free energy calculations, and many other calculations. Different data sampling strategies applied in building RMLPs are also discussed with a focus on how to collect structures for rare events and how to further improve their performance with active learning.
