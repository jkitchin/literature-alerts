Tuning the surface strain is a powerful strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of metal nanocatalysts, yet an atomically precise catalyst with intramolecular strain to unlock the atomic-level strain-structure-activity relationship is still highly desired. Herein, we report the synthesis, structural anatomy, and catalytic performance toward cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis of an atomically precise Ag16Cu18(C≡C-C6H11)24 (Ag16Cu18) nanocluster, which has a Cu6 ring in the center. The Cu-Cu distance in the Cu6 ring is only 1.616 Å in a single crystal, the shortest Cu-Cu bond in Cu nanomaterials to date. Furthermore, once Ag16Cu18 was loaded onto carbon paper, the ultrashort Cu-Cu bond elongated to ∼2.40 Å, still showing strong intramolecular compressive strain. Ag16Cu18 exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward oxime electrosynthesis, manifested by a maximal Faradaic efficiency, yield, and yield rate of cyclohexanone oxime reaching 47.4%, 95.4%, and 2.66 mmol·h-1·cm-2 at -0.35 V, respectively. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy revealed that the Cu sites adjacent to the Ag atoms primarily reduce NO and stabilize it at the *NH2OH stage, while the Cu sites with compressive strain provide H* for NO reduction and adsorb cyclohexanone to react with *NH2OH, forming cyclohexanone oxime simultaneously. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the presence of compressive strain in the Cu6 ring, which facilitates H* formation and cyclohexanone adsorption, hence significantly contributing to oxime generation. This study not only reports a case of atomically precise clusters with intramolecular compressive strain but also provides an atomic-level understanding for employing bimetallic nanocluster-based catalysts toward the electrosynthesis of valuable organic molecules.

TrIP2 is an advanced version of the transformer interatomic potential (TrIP) trained on the expanded ANI-2x data set, including more diverse molecular configurations with sulfur, fluorine, and chlorine. It leverages the equivariant SE(3)-transformer architecture, incorporating physical biases and continuous atomic representations. TrIP was introduced as a highly promising transferable interatomic potential, which we show here to generalize to new atom types with no alterations to the underlying model design. Benchmarking on COMP6 energy and force calculations, structure minimization tasks, torsion drives, and applications to molecules with unexpected conformational energy minima demonstrates TrIP2's high accuracy and transferability. Direct architectural comparisons demonstrate superior performance against ANI-2x, while holistic model evaluations─including training data and level-of-theory considerations─show comparative performance with state-of-the-art models like AIMNet2 and MACE-OFF23. Notably, TrIP2 achieves state-of-the-art force prediction performance on the COMP6 benchmarks and closely approaches DFT-optimized structures in torsion drives and geometry optimization tasks. Without requiring any architectural modifications, TrIP2 successfully capitalizes on additional training data to deliver enhanced generalizability and precision, establishing itself as a robust and scalable framework capable of accommodating future expansions or applications to new domains with minimal reengineering.

Low-cost ruthenium-based catalysts with high activity have emerged as promising alternatives to iridium-based counterparts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but the poor stability under high current density remains as a key challenge. Here, we utilize the synergistic complementary strategy of introducing earth-abundant Mn and Nb dopants in ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) for Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 nanoparticle electrocatalyst that exhibits a low overpotential of 209 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and good stability of > 400 h at 0.2 A cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Significantly, a PEMWE device fabricated with Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 anode can operate continuously at least for 1000 h at 0.5 A cm-2 with 59 μV h-1 decay rate. Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis, differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy measurements, X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that OER reaction on Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 primarily follows the adsorbate evolution mechanism with much favorable energy barrier accompanied by a locally passivated lattice oxygen mechanism (AEM-LPLOM) and the co-existed Nb and Mn in RuO2 crystal lattice could not only stabilize the lattice oxygen, but also relieve the valence state fluctuation of Ru site to stabilize the catalyst during the reaction.

Abstract. When simulating new particle formation rates, collisions in the system are approximated as hard spheres without long-range interactions. This simplification may lead to an underestimation of the actual formation rate. In this study, we employ semi-empirical molecular dynamics (SEMD) at the GFN1-xTB level of theory to probe the sticking process of the monomers sulfuric acid (SA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), nitric acid (NA), formic acid (FA), ammonia (AM), methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), and trimethylamine (TMA) onto freshly nucleated particles (FNPs). The FNPs considered are (SA)10(AM)10, (SA)10(MA)10, (SA)10(DMA)10, and (SA)10(TMA)10. In general, we find that the hard-sphere kinetic approximation, which neglects long-range interactions, significantly underestimates the number of collisions leading to sticking. By calculating the sticking coefficient from SEMD simulations, we obtain enhancement factors of 2.3 and 1.5 for the SA + (SA)10(AM)10 and AM + (SA)10(AM)10 collisions, respectively. A comparison with OPLS (optimized potentials for liquid simulations) all-atom force field simulations shows similar enhancement factors of 2.4 and 1.6 for the SA + (SA)10(AM)10 and AM + (SA)10(AM)10 collisions, respectively. Compared to the force field simulations, SEMD exhibits a more isotropic sticking behavior, with the probability remaining near unity for small offsets before rapidly dropping to 0 % beyond a certain offset. In contrast, the force field simulations show a more gradual decline in sticking probability due to certain orientations still leading to sticking. The largest discrepancy between the two methods occurs at lower collision velocities – below 200 m s−1 for SA and below 400 m s−1 for AM – where force field simulations, even for head-on collisions, predict low or zero sticking probability. This has previously been attributed to periodic repulsions between the rotating collision partners caused by fluctuations in their charge distributions. In contrast, SEMD simulations do not exhibit this behavior. Since these low velocities are not significantly populated in our simulations, both methods yield similar enhancement factors. However, for systems with larger effective masses, where such velocities are more prevalent, we would expect the two methods to diverge.

Abstract The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for energy conversion technologies like fuel cells and metal–air batteries. However, advancing efficient and stable ORR catalysts remains a significant challenge. Iron‐based single‐atom catalysts (Fe SACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to precious metals. However, their catalytic performance and stability remain constrained. Introducing a second metal (M) to construct Fe─M dual‐atom catalysts (Fe─M DACs) is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of Fe SACs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in Fe‐based DACs for ORR. It begins by examining the structural advantages of Fe─M DACs from the perspectives of electronic structure and reaction pathways. Next, the precise synthetic strategies for DACs are discussed, and the structure–performance relationships are explored, highlighting the role of the second metal in improving catalytic activity and stability. The review also covers in situ characterization techniques for real‐time observation of catalytic dynamics and reaction intermediates. Finally, future directions for Fe─M DACs are proposed, emphasizing the integration of advanced experimental strategies with theoretical simulations as well as artificial intelligence/machine learning to design highly active and stable ORR catalysts, aiming to expand the application of Fe─M DACs in energy conversion and storage technologies.

The cobalt crystalline islands (Cocryst) were electrochemically deposited onto a glassy carbon (GC) support and then modified by a facile spontaneous deposition of platinum. The electrocatalytic activity of the resulting Cocryst-Pt core-shell catalyst was evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline medium. The XRD characterization of the Cocryst-Pt islands revealed that the cobalt core had a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystalline structure, and that the platinum shell exhibited a crystalline structure with a preferential (111) orientation. SEM images showed that the average lateral size of the Cocryst islands was 1.17 μm, which increased to 1.32 μm after adding platinum. The XPS analysis indicated that the outer layer of the bulk metallic Cocryst islands was fully oxidized. During the spontaneous deposition of platinum, the outer Co(OH)2 layer was dissolved, leaving the cobalt core in a metallic state, while the platinum shell remained only partially oxidized. The high electrochemically active surface area of the Cocryst-Pt/GC electrode, along with a suitable crystalline structure of the Cocryst-Pt islands, contributes to enhancing its ORR activity by providing a greater number of surface active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent reduction. The ORR on the Cocryst-Pt catalyst occurs via a four-electron reaction pathway, with onset and half-wave potentials of 1.07 V and 0.87 V, respectively, which exceed those of polycrystalline platinum and a commercial benchmark Pt/C.

Abstract The electrocatalytic two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) presents an environmentally sustainable approach to produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Heterostructures coupling non‐noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) with carbon materials hold promise for 2e − ORR, but face challenges in controlling morphology, phase composition, and active centers. In this study, a hierarchically porous tremella‐like heterojunction characterized by ultrafine cubic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles within the amorphous carbon (UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC) is obtained using the integrated platform of green Fe‐based deep eutectic solvent via a two‐step annealing process. UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC exhibits remarkable overall and intrinsic 2e − ORR activity, delivering 96% H 2 O 2 selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 67.5 s −1 . Notably, UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC possesses superior H 2 O 2 production capabilities, showing long‐term stability of 100 h with a H 2 O 2 production rate of 8.1 g L −1 h −1 in flow‐cell, while achieving various medical‐grade H 2 O 2 concentrations (3.0–7.8 wt%). Additionally, integrating on‐site H 2 O 2 production with electro‐Fenton achieved rapid decomposition of contaminants. The unique heterostructure, with the synergistic effect of Fe 3 O 4 and amorphous carbon, enhances electronic conductivity. Moreover, the electronic redistribution at the interface of the heterostructure triggers the thermodynamically favorable multiple active sites of Fe and C centers for the 2e − ORR. This work offers a new perspective on transition metal‐based materials for H 2 O 2 production.

Abstract Nano‐heterointerface serves as a catalytic center for water dissociation promoted by the concerted interaction of *OH on oxide and *H on nitride. Kinetic energetics of water dissociation and hydroxyl (de)stabilization are vital to surface coverage of reactive *H and surface charge for *OH reductive desorption. electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of DMPO‐H and DMPO‐OH unravel radical nature of water‐dissociated *H and *OH. coherent synergism of interfacial ensemble and electronic effects realizes TOF/η−ɛ d volcano as the net result of work‐function‐directed competition between interfacial water dissociation (covalent control) and *OH reductive desorption (ionic control) kinetics, manifesting that alkaline HER volcano shaped by d‐band descriptor originates from intricate balance guided by work function descriptor. Orchestrated with alkali metal cations on fine‐tuning covalent/ionic interaction between catalyst surface and water‐derived intermediates, microrod‐array N–MoCoNiAl/NF electrode (NF═Ni foam) drives 10 mA cm −2 at overpotential of 10 mV in 1 m KOH. The proposed pathway may provide insight into how the peculiar electronic structure of multi‐site heterojunction and the interfacial hard‐soft covalent/electrostatic interactions impact molecular‐level mechanism for efficient Volmer kinetics.

Abstract Ferroelectric materials exhibit inherent polarization characteristics that render them viable options for improving photocatalytic performance via efficient charge carrier separation. Nonetheless, the majority of two dimensional (2D) materials exhibit an absence of ferroelectric properties owing to their elevated symmetry, which presents obstacles for their utilization in photocatalysis. This study presents two novel strategies for inducing ferroelectricity in 2D materials: intralayer polarization, accomplished by substituting phosphorus atoms in black phosphorus (BP) with elements like nitrogen (N), arsenic (As), or antimony (Sb); and interlayer polarization, realized through a controlled heterostructure design. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that these tailored materials demonstrate markedly diminished overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), with values as low as 1.04 and 1.12 eV, respectively. The materials exhibit competitive Gibbs free energy profiles for the hydrogen evolution process (HER), highlighting their adaptability. The findings provide a framework for utilizing intralayer and interlayer engineering to improve the ferroelectric characteristics of 2D materials, facilitating advanced applications in photocatalysis and renewable energy conversion.

In view of climate change, seawater desalination is of concern to mankind, as the most difficult step in water treatment is the isolation of NaCl from seawater. The methods currently used to disable seawater remain costly, so it is important to understand and improve other methods for reducing the cost of seawater filtration. An atomic-scale computational study of NaCl and H2O adsorption on graphite and graphene is presented, with the aim of estimating the ability of graphite-graphene to remove NaCl from seawater to obtain drinking water. The calculations are based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), using the Grid-based Projector-Augmented Wave (GPAW) approach, Atomistic Simulation Environment (ASE), and Quantum ESPRESSO methods. The main results of our work are the optimization of H2O and NaCl molecule energies and densities of molecular states, and the calculation of the optimal adsorption distance of these molecules on the adsorbent (graphite-graphene). The observed changes in adsorption energies and density of states of the adsorbent could be exploited in the perspective of seawater filter applications. Our results could contribute to the optimization of potential seawater filter applications. The present work provides interesting information to the theoretical and experimental communities working in this field of research. It opens up the debate on the adsorption of H2O and NaCl molecules on graphite and graphene.

Halogen elements, as common nonmetal dopants, have attracted significant attention for their potential in creating highly active photocatalysts. To improve the electronic property of BiVO4, a highly promising photoanode nanomaterial for solar water splitting, the halogen atom (Cl, Br, and I) doping strategy and underlying modification mechanisms were explored in detail by the first-principles calculations here. Formation energies confirmed that halogen doping at the O sites of BiVO4 is energetically favorable and can be realized experimentally. The conduction band minimum (CBM) energy level is stabilized and even shifted into the occupied electron states, while the valence band maximum (VBM) energy level is increased for BiVO4 upon halogen atom doping with a trend: I > Br > Cl. Furthermore, the n-type electron-donating behavior becomes increasingly significant with higher dopant mass concentrations, which is attributed to the lower electronegativity of introduced halogen atoms compared to that of the substituted O atoms. Moreover, doping with Cl, Br, or I atoms induces strong spin polarization and effectively suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in BiVO4. Furthermore, H2O adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) results for each fundamental stage confirmed that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process is favored by such an n-type doping method. All of these results proved that halogen atom (Cl, Br, and I) doping is a reliable strategy to improve photoelectrical properties, consequently boosting the photocatalytic performance of BiVO4 through modifications to its electronic structure.

Abstract High‐entropy‐alloy (HEA) nanocrystals, characterized by multicomponent solid solutions and synergistic effects, hold great potential in catalysis. However, synthesizing HEA hollow nanocrystals with 3D architectures and controlled surface atomic arrangements to enhance catalytic activity and durability remains challenging. Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are presented, derived from Pd@HEA core‐shell nanocrystals featuring a few HEA atomic layers containing five platinum‐group metals, synthesized via a Fe(III)‐based wet etching strategy. The controlled etching process transformed Pd@HEA core‐shell nanocubes enclosed by {100} facets into Pd@HEA porous nanocubes, HEA cubic nanocages, and eventually, HEA cubic nanoframes composed of subnanometer‐thick ridges dominated by {110} facets, vacancies, and step atoms. Electron microscopy and synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the randomly mixed coordination environments of the constituent elements, underscoring the excellent atomic mixing within the nanoframes. These nanoframes demonstrated a 9.72‐fold higher acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) specific activity at an overpotential of −0.1 V than commercial Pt/C catalysts, remarkable durability after 15 000 potential cycles, and competitive performance as cathode catalysts for practical applications in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Density functional theory calculations attributed the superior HER performance to {110}‐enclosed atomically mixed surfaces and low‐coordination sites, optimizing hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG H* ) near the ideal value of 0.

Abstract Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) represent a transformative technology for sustainable hydrogen production and power generation by converting energy between chemical and electrical forms. Operating at intermediate temperatures, PCECs utilize proton‐conducting electrolytes, achieving high efficiency and reduced degradation. However, a major bottleneck lies at the oxygen electrode due to sluggish kinetics and limited active sites. To address this, we present a hybrid oxygen electrode featuring PrNi 0.7 Co 0.3 O 3–δ (PNC) backbone infused with oxygen vacancy‐rich praseodymium oxide (PrO x ) nanoparticles. This design leverages the interplay between surface and bulk properties to enhance oxygen adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic kinetics. The PrO x introduces abundant oxygen vacancies and modulates the d ‐band center for optimal adsorption energy, while the PNC backbone provides robust proton conduction and stabilizes reaction intermediates. Cells incorporating this hybrid electrode demonstrate a peak power density of 1.56 W cm −2 at 600 °C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.25 A cm −2 at 1.30 V in electrolysis mode. Faradaic and energy efficiency reach 96.8% and 89.9%, respectively, with exceptional thermal cycling stability and reduced polarization resistance (0.079 Ω cm 2 ). This study underscores the potential of advanced electrode architectures to enhance the efficiency, durability, and applicability of PCECs in renewable energy systems.

In the quest to enhance the safety of lithium-ion batteries, substantial research is underway to develop all-solid-state batteries, facing challenges in achieving high ion conductivity in solid electrolytes. This study aims to enhance the ion conductivity by incorporating carbon-doped graphitic carbon nitride (C-doped g-C3N4) microspheres as an inorganic filler into the poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). Leveraging the advantageous properties of g-C3N4 as an effective inorganic filler by enhancing its Lewis acid-base interactions with lithium, we modified g-C3N4 through carbon doping to improve the ionic conductivity of the SPE. Our experimental analysis supports the increased lithium transference number after hybridizing electrolytes with C-doped g-C3N4, signifying heightened ion mobility resulting from carbon substitution on g-C3N4. Subsequent density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal increased lithium binding energy due to the carbon doping of g-C3N4, thereby ultimately enhancing the ion conductivity by promoting salt dissociation. Optimizing carbon doping levels and hybrid electrolyte composition yields improved ion conductivity and electrochemical performance, with optimal outcomes observed at 7% C-doped g-C3N4 with SPE. Evaluation in a pouch cell with the NCM811 cathode underscores the applicability of the hybrid electrolyte on a large scale, showcasing promising advancements in battery technology. Our carbon-doped g-C3N4 filler demonstrates promising potential in advancing ion conductivity through enhanced salt dissociations.

Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) holds great potential as a sustainable strategy for green hydrogen production. However, it still faces significant challenges due to the lack of highly efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a synergistic approach by incorporating Ru atoms into MoS2 nanosheets to optimize the structure and conductivity has been proposed, which could improve the HER performance of MoS2 under alkaline conditions. Combining theoretical calculations and structural characterizations, it is demonstrated that the Ru atom introduction leads to the localized distortions of MoS2, generating additional active sites for H* adsorption, and reduces the free energy to adsorb and desorb hydrogen. Furthermore, the Ru introduction makes partial transformation from the 2H phase to the 1T phase in MoS2, which results in the change of the electronic structure and further enhances the electrical conductivity. As a result, the Ru-doped MoS2 electrocatalysts exhibit the high HER activities with the low overpotentials of 61 mV and 79 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH and alkaline seawater, respectively. This work provides a novel design strategy for enhancing HER activity through the synergistic modulation of structural and electronic properties, offering valuable insights for the development of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.

Developing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting remains a pivotal challenge for sustainable energy. In this work, we present a bulk nanoporous C15 intermetallic alloy synthesized through electrodealloying of a eutectic multiprincipal element precursor. Unlike conventional metallic nanostructures, this catalyst features an ultrathin multiprincipal element oxide (MPEO) layer, which generates abundant active sites and achieves exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, surpassing most reported catalysts. Crucially, the material demonstrates unprecedented stability at industrial-level current densities (1 A/cm2 at 396 mV), enabled by operando amorphization of the MPEO layer during prolonged operation. This structural evolution stabilizes the catalyst-electrolyte interface while retaining intrinsic activity. Our findings redefine design principles for robust, high-performance electrocatalysts by integrating bulk intermetallic architectures with self-optimizing surface chemistry.

As predicted by the Hume-Rothery rules, forming solid solutions of rutile IrO2 with other metal oxides that have different crystal structures is thermodynamically challenging. Consequently, achieving high solubility of foreign elements in Ir-based solid-solution oxides has been significantly limited. We demonstrate that hexagonal-perovskite BaIrO3 can serve as a flexible matrix oxide capable of incorporating a wide spectrum of (post)transition-metal cations with different electronic structures, ranging from d0 to d10 configurations. Among 12 cation solutes, Ta5+, Nb5+, and Zr4+ are found to be stable without substantial leaching during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic condition. Acceptor-type trivalent cations, including Sc3+, In3+, and Fe3+, are identified to leach out gradually from the particle surface while enhancing the OER catalytic activity. Both X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently show that the robust face-sharing [IrO6] octahedral framework of the solid solutions remains unperturbed unless electrochemical leaching rapidly occurs. As a result, notably high S-numbers, on the order of 106, are achievable at pH = 1. Although our work focuses on single-element incorporation, it is suggested that the solid-solution methodology is an effective strategy for developing stable, long-lasting OER catalysts with further reduced Ir usage for acidic water oxidation.

High-valent iron oxido species, central to many enzymatic and biomimetic catalyzed organic oxidative transformations, can be generated by direct electrochemical oxidation, circumventing high-energy O atom donor reagents. Electrochemical generation necessitates knowledge of the redox potentials involved, which is hindered by the lack of well-defined Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox waves in the voltammetry of many iron-based catalysts. Hence, other approaches including chemical oxidation and bulk spectro(electro)chemical methods need to be taken. In the case of the well-studied oxidation catalyst, [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+, where N4Py is 1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine, estimates of the Fe(III/IV) redox potentials range from 0.4 to 1.3 V vs SCE. Here, we show that electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy reveals "hidden" redox waves, and hence redox potentials, when coupled with cyclic voltammetry. Rapid spectral acquisition (>2 Hz) of surface-enhanced Raman spectra at electrochemically roughened gold electrodes enables real-time spectral acquisition during cyclic voltammetry. We show that the Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox potential of [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+ is close to that determined earlier by chemical redox titrations (0.85 V vs SCE). Furthermore, comproportionation and adsorption processes are shown to impact the rates of electron transfer observed, which rationalizes the absence of a distinct Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox wave in its cyclic voltammetry.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a versatile and environmentally friendly oxidant with broad applications in industry, energy, and environmental remediation. Electrocatalytic H2O2 production via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) has emerged as a sustainable alternative to traditional anthraquinone processes. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a class of crystalline porous materials, exhibit high structural tunability, large surface areas, and chemical stability, making them promising electrocatalysts for 2e− ORR. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in COF-based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production, including both metal-free and metal-containing systems. We discuss key strategies in COF design—such as dimensional modulation, linkage engineering, heteroatom doping, and post-synthetic modification—and highlight their effects on activity, selectivity, and stability. Fundamental insights into the 2e− ORR mechanism and evaluation metrics are also provided. Finally, we offer perspectives on current challenges and future directions, emphasizing the integration of machine learning, conductivity enhancement, and scalable synthesis to advance COFs toward practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.
