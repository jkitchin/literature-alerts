Two-dimensional transition metal (TM)-doped dichalcogenides (TMDs) are among the most promising materials for water-splitting catalysts. Among various methods applied to promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in TMDs, doping with TM heteroatoms has attracted attention because this strategy allows optimization of hydrogen adsorption and H2 generation reactions. Herein, we conduct in-depth, systematic analyses of the trends in the change in the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*)—the most well-known descriptor for evaluating HER performance—for doped TMDs. The total of 150 different doped TMDs are used to conduct an atomic-level analysis of the origin of ΔGH* changes upon TM heteroatom doping. Moreover, we suggest two key factors that govern hydrogen adsorption over doped TMDs: 1) changes in the charge of chalcogen atoms, where hydrogen atoms are adsorbed onto early-TM-doped structures and 2) structural deformation energies accompanying the introduced dopants of the late-TM-doped structures. Furthermore, we propose a new perspective on how vacancies in TM-doped TMDs can result in the enhanced ΔGH* for the HER. We suggest that introducing electrostatic and structural controls in early- and late-TM-doped systems, respectively, are effective strategies for achieving thermoneutral ΔGH* in TMDs and promote the design of new TMD catalysts with superior water-splitting capabilities.

Solid form selection and design of crystalline small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) would benefit from computational prediction and rationalization of the mechanical properties. Before such practical applications can be considered, the robustness and reproducibility of the computed properties with respect to the chosen level of theory must be understood. In this work, elastic constants of eight molecular crystals, with an emphasis on APIs, have been calculated using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT). The different DFT methods considered do not, in general, consistently predict the absolute magnitudes of the elastic moduli, which disagree by over 50% for some crystals. Relative properties such as elastic anisotropy are more robust, mostly consistent between models, and in qualitative agreement with experiment. Calculated anisotropies could also be rationalized in terms of the structural features of the crystal. Overall, this work reveals that DFT-computed elastic properties may not offer a ground truth in absolute terms. Future applications of DFT in the context of high-throughput material screening or training of machine learning models will therefore require judicious selection of target properties and evaluation metrics. Only after methodological limitations are properly identified can more in-depth investigations be undertaken to assess the feasibility of applying DFT in pharmaceutical development.

The incorporation of disparate materials into heterostructures has arisen as a formidable technique for modulating interfaces and electronic configurations. The introduction of two-dimensional (2D) materials has unveiled unparalleled prospects for generating innovative heterostructures in the guise of van der Waals stacks. Tantalum sulfide (TaS2), a prominent 2D material, has been extensively studied across various domains, faces constraints in thermoelectric conversion attributed to its diminished absolute Seebeck coefficient below 10 μV K−1. By constructing a two-dimensional van der Waals stack heterostructure, TaS2/organics/TiS2, a significantly enhanced absolute Seebeck coefficient of 38.3 μV K−1 was obtained, mostly attributed to the induced interfacial effect. The power factor reached 87.6 μW m−1 K−2, marking a sevenfold increase compared to the original. The thermoelectric generator demonstrated a maximum power of 86.4 nW at a temperature difference of 40 K. Employing such heterostructure films in tactile and respiration sensors demonstrated encouraging prospects for aiding the visually impaired with language assistance and facilitating real-time monitoring of respiratory rates for health monitoring purposes. This study highlights the expansive potential of two-dimensional van der Waals stack heterostructure technology for use in flexible thermoelectric generators, wearable sensors, and beyond.

ConspectusDue to its importance for electrolyzers or metal-air batteries for energy conversion or storage, there is huge interest in the development of high-performance materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Theoretical investigations have aided the search for active material motifs through the construction of volcano plots for the kinetically sluggish OER, which involves the transfer of four proton-electron pairs to form a single oxygen molecule. The theory-driven volcano approach has gained unprecedented popularity in the catalysis and energy communities, largely due to its simplicity, as adsorption free energies can be used to approximate the electrocatalytic activity by heuristic descriptors.In the last two decades, the binding-energy-based volcano method has witnessed a renaissance with special concepts being developed to incorporate missing factors into the analysis. To this end, this Account summarizes and discusses the different generations of volcano plots for the example of the OER. While first-generation methods relied on the assessment of the thermodynamic information for the OER reaction intermediates by means of scaling relations, the second and third generations developed strategies to include overpotential and kinetic effects into the analysis of activity trends. Finally, the fourth generation of volcano approaches allowed the incorporation of various mechanistic pathways into the volcano methodology, thus paving the path toward data- and mechanistic-driven volcano plots in electrocatalysis.Although the concept of volcano plots has been significantly expanded in recent years, further research activities are discussed by challenging one of the main paradigms of the volcano concept. To date, the evaluation of activity trends relies on the assumption of proton-coupled electron transfer steps (CPET), even though there is experimental evidence of sequential proton-electron transfer (SPET) steps. While the computational assessment of SPET for solid-state electrodes is ambitious, it is strongly suggested to comprehend their importance in energy conversion and storage processes, including the OER. This can be achieved by knowledge transfer from homogeneous to heterogeneous electrocatalysis and by focusing on the material class of single-atom catalysts in which the active center is well defined. The derived concept of how to analyze the importance of SPET for mechanistic pathways in the OER over solid-state electrodes could further shape our understanding of the proton-electron transfer steps at electrified solid/liquid interfaces, which is crucial for further progress toward sustainable energy and climate neutrality.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed along two distinct pathways: the 4-electron pathway and the 2-electron pathway. The 4-electron pathway holds significant value in fuel cell technology, whereas the 2-electron pathway plays a crucial role in the industrial production of H2O2. Accurate prediction of the catalytic selectivity in the ORR stands as a pivotal factor in designing effective catalyst materials. It has been experimentally demonstrated that Au–Pd nanoalloy exhibit a high selectivity toward electrocatalytic H2O2 production. However, based on the widely employed computational hydrogen electrode method, the production of H2O on the surface of Au–Pd nanoalloy is more thermodynamically favorable, which shows a discrepancy with experimental results. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of aqueous environment as well as electrode potential toward the ORR employing state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations. Our work reveals that the water molecules above the Au–Pd nanoalloy surface can alter the adsorption behavior of O2 and weaken the interaction between metal atom in the catalyst and oxygen atom in O2, therefore contributing to a high selectivity of Au–Pd nanoalloy toward H2O2 production. With a more negative electrode potential, the stability of H2O2 will decrease, and the corresponding selectivity will be lowered. These discoveries provide a dynamic perspective elucidating efficient H2O2 production on Au–Pd nanoalloy surfaces. Furthermore, they underscore the paramount significance of both the aqueous environment and electrode potential in shaping the ORR process.

This study delves into understanding the relationship between synthesis conditions and the resulting properties of the Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF) UiO-66, with an emphasis on machine learning (ML) in making quantitative predictions. Utilizing a comprehensive, manually curated data set, three ML models are trained to predict UiO-66 properties, including specific surface area, defect concentration, and particle size, based on synthesis parameters. A solution to the inverse problem, which involves finding optimal synthesis conditions for given properties using the method of differential evolution, has been implemented in the software. Experimental validation of models through synthesis and detailed characterization of UiO-66 samples and comparison with the predicted properties show a high accuracy, confirming their reliability. Interpretation of the ML models using Shapley additive explanation values and two-dimensional (2D) partial dependence plots reveals both previously known patterns, validating the adequacy of the models, and new, previously unexplored patterns in the relationships between the synthesis conditions and UiO-66 properties. The developed models can be used as a basis for further research on MOF synthesis. This approach can be applied to the rational design of UiO-66 for various applications.

Abstract Seawater electrolysis (SWE) is proposed to be a promising approach to green hydrogen (H 2 ) production but its large‐scale deployment faces challenges because of the anodic competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and high energy consumption. To address these challenges, innovative hybrid SWE systems have recently emerged, able to mitigate the interference of CER and substantially reduce the electrical energy needed. Herein, the preparation of 2D layered PtTe nanosheets (e‐PtTe NSs) using the liquid‐phase exfoliation method is reported, which show outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution (HER), hydrazine oxidation (HzOR), and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in seawater. Using e‐PtTe NSs as trifunctional catalysts, two hybrid SWE systems are demonstrated: 1) a hydrazine‐assisted acid‐alkaline dual‐electrolyte seawater electrolyzer enabled by a bipolar membrane (BPM‐OHzSWE), which can simultaneously produce H 2 and generate electricity through harvesting the electrochemical neutralization energy and leveraging the advantage of the HzOR over the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in terms of anodic potentials; 2) a hydrazine‐assisted SWE system powered by a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC), which can realize self‐powered H 2 production. These novel hybrid SWE systems show substantial promise for energy‐saving and cost‐effective production of H 2 from seawater.

δ-MnO2 catalysts have attracted much attention because of the abundance of oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface to achieve efficient catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde (HCHO). However, the recycling and regeneration of powdered δ-MnO2 nano-catalysts still limits the practical application of the catalysts. Here, the surface of aramid fiber (MPIA) was treated by corona activation to introduce reactive groups, such as -OH, and -COOH. These reactive groups can promote the exposure of more Mn3+ on the surface of loaded δ-MnO2 to produce OVs. Meanwhile, the strong interactions between the activated MPAI and δ-MnO2 was formed, which helped to improve the stability and cyclic regeneration of the fiber-based δ-MnO2 catalysts. The effects of Mn3+ and OVs on the catalytic performance of δ-MnO2 were targeted and characterized by SEM, XPS and BET. The pathways of HCHO removal by OVs on the δ-MnO2 surface and the relative free energies of the corresponding intermediates were also explored. The results revealed that optimizing the morphology of MPIA surface-loaded δ-MnO2 can obtain a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, with excellent HCHO removal efficiency at room temperature and high catalytic activity even after multiple cycle regeneration.

Theoretical calculations at the revPBE0-D3(PCM)/def2-TZVP level were performed to investigate the mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the FeN4-doped NCMs (graphene, single-walled (6,6)-armchair and (12,0)-zigzag carbon nanotubes) as catalysts. The effect of the support and relative orientation of FeN4 fragment in the catalyst structure on the ORR activity and stability of the differently adsorbed successive intermediates (O2*, HO2*, O*, HO*, H2O2*, H2O*) is discussed. Special attention is given to the possible poisoning effect of CO. The relative catalytic activity of the metal center and the adjacent C2 site of the carbon support are analyzed depending on the structure of the support. The metal catalytic center on the armchair nanotube and graphene supports is prone to deactivation by poisoning with CO, whereas in the zigzag nanotube supported catalyst the metal center is tolerant to CO. The four-electron mechanism of ORR is shown to be preferable over the two-electron mechanism in both acidic and alkaline media, both on the metal and C2 centers.

Developing an affordable and efficient electrocatalyst for bifunctional activity is crucial for the advancement of water electrolysis technology. Doping with foreign atoms in electrocatalysts can tune the electronic properties, which further improves the water-splitting process. Herein, we have developed Ce-doped Ni0.85Se as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. The hydrothermal method was used to develop a two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet of the Ce-doped Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst. The as-developed pristine and doped electrocatalysts were characterized through various techniques. The optimized Ce0.1Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst represents −0.238 and 1.56 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode as an onset potential for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, to generate 20 and 50 mA/cm2 current density. The Ce0.1Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst works as a suitable cell in an alkaline medium with 1.73 V to generate 10 mA/cm2 and 24 h stability. The introduction of Ce doping plays a pivotal role in tuning the electronic environment and facilitating a synergistic effect, ultimately improving the overall efficiency. Moreover, the active sites for water splitting were generated by expansion and distortion in the Ni0.85Se lattice. The enhanced specific surface area and porous 2D nanosheets of the doped sample are beneficial for water splitting. The theoretical results also prove that after doping with Ce, the catalyst has zero band gap, optimum Gibbs hydrogen adsorption energy, and an electronic state are the reasons for improved electrocatalytic performance. The actual active sites in the Ce-doped Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst were determined with density functional theory calculations. Therefore, this idea can generate a route for developing a doped electrocatalyst with efficient and stable activity.

Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly technology for producing hydrogen energy. Recent studies have shown that high entropy alloys (HEAs) and N-doped graphene layers coated alloys have superior HER performance compared to traditional alloys. This paper presents a simple method for synthesizing N-doped graphene layers coated HEAs with controllable thickness. NiFeCo-based alloy materials are prepared using this method and used as HER catalysts in alkaline conditions. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the CuNiFeCoCrTi@N-doped graphene nanoparticles (CuNiFeCoCrTi@NC) with a graphene shell of 2–3 layers exhibit the best hydrogen evolution performance. The improvement of hydrogen evolution performance should be related to the unique properties of HEAs and coating the surface of alloys with thin graphene shell. This study presents a simple and efficient method for synthesizing HEA@NC NPs, which can be used as an efficient electrocatalyst in alkaline water splitting systems.

Herein, we propose a novel MoS2 supported single Ni and Pb atoms catalyst (Ni/Pd@MoS2), on which the enhanced efficiency of water splitting is confirmed by quantitative density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Bader charge, electron density difference (EDD) and projected density of state (PDOS) analysis demonstrates that the moderate electron transfer is reached by the synergy of the Ni atom and the Pd atom. As extra channel for excited carrier migration, the present of defect states obviously prolongs the carrier lifetime (143.45 ps). The unique electronic environment contributes to the electronic synergy and spatially separated of the effective active sites, leading the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) happen smoothly on the Pd and S site, respectively. Our research presents a novel idea for the development of highly efficient diatomic catalysts towards overall water splitting.

Developing new materials through traditional trial-and-error is time-consuming and costly due to the vast potential compositions to explore. Moreover, some desirable properties are mutually exclusive, presenting challenges for materials design. Herein, we employed an active learning strategy to address the strength-ductility trade-off in SAC105 lead-free solders. We developed two Gaussian regression models, one for strength and one for elongation representing ductility. The Gaussian Upper Confidence Boundary algorithm, a Bayesian optimization method, was used to balance exploitation and exploration by considering prediction uncertainty. The variance weight was designed to decay with adaptive iterations. The two models were linearly combined and the maximal combined model recommended alloys on the Pareto front for experiments. After just three iterations, a new 91.4Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu-1.5Bi-4.4In-0.2Ti low-silver SAC solder was discovered, exhibiting 73.94±5.05 MPa strength and 24.37±5.92% elongation, representing the best comprehensive mechanical properties. Weldability experiments also showed excellent performance. Based on Ab initio molecular dynamics, a precise machine learning potential revealed the alloying mechanism in Sn-In solid solutions with quantum accuracy in systems of over 103 atoms, closely matching experimental X-ray diffraction pattern. To facilitate materials informatics development, all active learning algorithms was made open-source in our designed framework, Bgolearn.

In this work, P and Mo dual-doped CoNiS (PMo-CoNiS) nanosheet arrays were successfully constructed through a common solvothermal treatment. The precise doping of P and Mo species into the CoNiS can regulate the microstructures and meanwhile endow with PMo-CoNiS abundant amorphous/crystalline heterointerfaces, which can adjust the electronic structure, thus enhancing the intrinsic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, ultra-low overpotentials of merely 156 and 58 mV are required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for OER and HER, respectively, and the electrocatalysts PMo-CoNiS also exhibit low Tafel slopes and maintain robust stability for 48 h in alkaline media at a high current density of 50 mA cm−2. In addition, in an assembled electrolyte cell for overall water splitting, a voltage as low as 1.48 V is sufficient to yield a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed that the enhanced OER and HER result from the optimized OH* and H* adsorption energy of PMo-CoNiS due to P, Mo dual doping and generated interfacial effect. This work may offer an avenue for designing low-cost bifunctional catalysts with superior catalytic activity and provide a new application strategy for broader applications in various electrocatalytic fields.

Molecular crystals are difficult to model with accurate first-principles methods due to large unit cells. On the other hand, accurate modeling is required as polymorphs often differ by only 1 kJ/mol. Machine learning interatomic potentials promise to provide accuracy of the baseline first-principles methods with a cost lower by orders of magnitude. Using the existing databases of the density functional theory calculations for molecular crystals and molecules, we train global machine learning interatomic potentials, usable for any molecular crystal. We test the performance of the potentials on experimental benchmarks and show that they perform better than classical force fields and, in some cases, are comparable to the density functional theory calculations.

The ability to find optimal molecular structures with desired properties is a popular challenge, with applications in areas such as drug discovery. Genetic algorithms are a common approach to global minima molecular searches due to their ability to search large regions of the energy landscape and decrease computational time via parallelization. In order to decrease the amount of unstable intermediate structures being produced and increase the overall efficiency of an evolutionary algorithm, clustering was introduced in multiple instances. However, there is little literature detailing the effects of differentiating the selection frequencies between clusters. In order to find a balance between exploration and exploitation in our genetic algorithm, we propose a system of clustering the starting population and choosing clusters for an evolutionary algorithm run via a dynamic probability that is dependent on the fitness of molecules generated by each cluster. We define four parameters, MFavOvrAll-A, MFavClus-B, NoNewFavClus-C, and Select-D, that correspond to a reward for producing the best structure overall, a reward for producing the best structure in its own cluster, a penalty for not producing the best structure, and a penalty based on the selection ratio of the cluster, respectively. A reward increases the probability of a cluster's future selection, while a penalty decreases it. In order to optimize these four parameters, we used a Gaussian distribution to approximate the evolutionary algorithm performance of each cluster and performed a grid search for different parameter combinations. Results show parameter MFavOvrAll-A (rewarding clusters for producing the best structure overall) and parameter Select-D (appearance penalty) have a significantly larger effect than parameters MFavClus-B and NoNewFavClus-C. In order to produce the most successful models, a balance between MFavOvrAll-A and Select-D must be made that reflects the exploitation vs exploration trade-off often seen in reinforcement learning algorithms. Results show that our reinforcement-learning-based method for selecting clusters outperforms an unclustered evolutionary algorithm for quinoline-like structure searches.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a quantum chemical computational method used to predict and analyze the electronic properties of atoms, molecules, and solids based on the density of electrons rather than wavefunctions. It provides insights into the structure, bonding, and behaviour of different molecules, including those involved in the development of chemotherapeutic agents, such as Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). HDACs are a wide group of metalloenzymes that facilitate the removal of acetyl groups from acetyl-lysine residues situated in the N-terminal tail of histones. Abnormal HDAC recruitment has been linked to several human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, it has been recognized as a prospective target for accelerating the development of anticancer therapies. Researchers have studied HDACs and its inhibitors extensively using a combination of experimental methods and diverse in-silico approaches such as machine learning and quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, pharmacophore mapping, and more. In this context, DFT studies can make significant contribution by shedding light on the molecular properties, interactions, reaction pathways, transition states, reactivity and mechanisms involved in the development of HDACis. This review attempted to elucidate the scope in which DFT methodologies may be used to enhance our comprehension of the molecular aspects of HDAC inhibitors, aiding in the rational design and optimization of these compounds for therapeutic applications in cancer and other ailments. The insights gained can guide experimental efforts toward developing more potent and selective HDAC inhibitors.

In this chapter, the acknowledgments that appeared in 2,075 articles published between 2005 and 2019 in the "Top Five" analytic philosophy journals are analyzed with both qualitative and quantitative techniques. After framing the acknowledgments as zones of a sui generis communication between authors and readers, which enable analytic philosophers to place themselves in the social space of analytic philosophy, the first part of the chapter focuses on the stylistics of the acknowledgments. Unwritten norms and conventions that shape the acknowledgments as a literary genre are reconstructed and explained in the light of the theory of acknowledgments as positioning signals (Chap. 2 ). Then, in the second part of the chapter, a quantitative approach is used to measure different social dimensions of the acknowledgees population. In this way, the social space of recent analytic philosophy is charted.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been widely considered as one of the promising candidates to replace platinum-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts due to their attractive properties. However, the single active site in such catalysts poses challenges in surpassing the inherent limits of scaling relations between adsorption energy of multi-intermediates in ORR catalytic process. Herein, inspired by the concept of multiple active centers, we design a series of stable pyrite-like bimetallic diselenides (A0.5B0.5Se2, A = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, B = Cu, Cd, Sn) as catalysts, which aim at enhancing ORR catalytic activity through synergistic effect in dual active sites. Through density functional theory calculations, we find that the ORR activities of most A0.5B0.5Se2 catalysts are comparable to or even better than those of the noble metal Pt, verifying the promotional ORR activities of A0.5B0.5Se2. Among them, Co0.5Sn0.5Se2 has an overpotential of 0.31 V, which shows better catalytic performance than Pt for ORR. Such improvement is attributed to the tandem reaction mechanism and the reduction in the barrier for the rate-determining steps, resulting from the presence of dual active sites within Co0.5Sn0.5Se2. The projected density of states (PDOS) and Bader charge analysis reveal that the excellent catalytic activity is contributed by the strong d-p orbital hybridization between Co and Sn in the Co0.5Sn0.5Se2, which significantly weakens the over-adsorption of the crucial O* intermediates. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights for designing optimum ORR catalysts.

The environmentally benign and long-lived zeolite catalyst is highly desired for Friedel-Crafts (FC) alkylation of benzene with long-chain olefins. Herein, MWW zeolites with different layer arrangements and surface structures are employed as model catalysts to investigate the effects of microscale structure on the catalytic behaviors for the alkylation of benzene with 1-dodecene. It is revealed that two kinds of acid sites located on the external surface and within surface 12-membered ring (12MR) pockets of MWW zeolites are effective for this reaction. Unexpectedly, the turnover frequency (TOF) of the effective acid sites over single-layer MWW (SL-MWW) is significantly lower than that of MCM-22. Kinetic study indicates that apparent activation energy (Ea) is decreased in the order of MCM-36 > MCM-22 > SL-MWW. Combined with DFT calculation, the lowest TOF and Ea over SL-MWW can be reasonably attributed to the higher proportion of acid sites in the 12MR pockets and its higher diffusional limitation for products. Moreover, the highest Ea of MCM-36 and adsorption energy verified the decreased diffusion limitation of 12MR pockets due to the structure defect resulting from the desilication. Finally, the highly efficient and stable MCM-36 catalyst was achieved in the optimal reaction conditions, which is a potential catalyst for industrial application in the field of FC alkylation reactions.

Single-atom catalysts have garnered significant attention by showing sparkling performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the air cathode side of energy devices such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells. This work presents a novel catalyst, AC-CuFe-NC, that incorporates Fe-doped CuO atomic clusters (CuOFe) synergistically with single-atom sites. The AC-CuFe-NC demonstrates outstanding ORR performance (half-wave potential of 0.92 V) and an oxygen overpotential gap between ORR and OER as low as 0.61 V, which is among the top reported performances. Combined with in situ ATR-SEIRAS and DFT calculations, it is shown that the synergistic CuOFe atomic clusters are effective in inducing the electronic structure redistribution of the Fe single-atom site, modulating oxygen adsorption energy, and lowering ORR barriers. More importantly, it is revealed that the synergistic adsorption of clusters and single-atom sites establishes hydrogen bonds between the oxygenated intermediates and the electrolyte H2O molecules. The constructed hydrogen bond can provide a pathway for efficient proton transport as supported by kinetic isotope experiments, leading to a substantial enhancement in reaction kinetics. Additionally, the oxygenated intermediates are stabilized, and the Fe-O bond is elongated during the final step of ORR, thereby facilitating the desorption of OH*. The excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of AC-CuFe-NC enable it to show promising application in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The innovative catalyst structure and synergistic mechanism demonstrated in this study shed light on the development of high-performance catalysts in energy devices.

One mixed oxide with 5 cations in equimolar proportions in the sublattice, to fulfil high-entropy oxide (HEO) criteria, has been developed and investigated as oxygen carrier for chemical looping combustion processes. As far as we know, nobody has explored this class of material for chemical looping combustion. Material is prepared by direct mixing of five metal oxides (CuO, Mn2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2, MgO), followed by calcination at 1000, 1100 and 1200 °C for 6h in air. XRD characterization provides strong evidence that the synthesized oxygen carriers possess the hallmark properties of HEO, and SEM-EDX analysis shows an overall homogeneous metal distribution. Materials have one main cubic phase with the empirical formula MnCuMgFeTiO7, dominating under all conditions. One of the key objectives of this study is achieved, reduce chemical stress during redox cycles. Oxygen transfer capability is investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and batch fluidized bed reactor experiments for different fuels and atmospheres. Mass-based oxygen transport capacities for lattice oxygen and oxygen uncoupling are around 5.5wt% and 1.1wt%, respectively. This work opens up a new dimension for the future preparation of oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes, since the vast compositional space of HEO provides opportunities to tune both chemical and physical characteristics.

Abstract The sluggish reaction kinetics has greatly hampered the development of reversible Li‐CO 2 batteries. Especially during charge, high charge voltage and possible side reactions during Li 2 CO 3 decomposition require both high activity and strong durability of catalysts. Herein, a strategy of introducing rich sulfur vacancies is proposed, which tailors the configuration of Li 2 CO 3 and the orbital structure of CoS to realize the dual enhancement. The calculation results show that charge redistribution by sulfur vacancies on the catalyst stretches the adsorbed Li 2 CO 3 and consequently facilitates its decomposition. Moreover, the induced vacancies lower the S 2p band center, promoting the electrochemical stability of sulfides. Therefore, Li‐CO 2 batteries with sulfur vacancy‐rich CoS exhibit a low overpotential of 1.07 V after 400 h cycling, while batteries with pristine CoS have a short lifespan that the overpotential exceeds 1.75 V after cycling for 200 h. This study not only proposes a strategy to improve both catalytic activity and stability but also paves new avenues for designing advanced catalysts for Li‐CO 2 batteries and beyond. image

The development of an efficient and stable electrode remains an attractive challenge for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to generate cheaper and green hydrogen (H2). Herein, we have fabricated a novel multicomponent molybdenum (Mo) doped bismuth vanadate/graphene (Mo-doped BiVO4@graphene) photoanode by simple spin coating technique followed by an annealing process. Precise control over Mo and graphene doping concentration (GR3/BVO:Mo-0.5) was attained, enabling excellent photocurrent density (4-fold increase as compared to BVO) with an enhanced rate of H2 production. This is attributed to the synergistic effect between molybdenum and graphene enhancing charge carrier density and suppressing the recombination rate of photo-generated electrons and holes. Our DFT studies indicate a reduction in the band gap value after doping pure BVO with Mo. In addition, we observed that the potential determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the electrochemical adsorption of hydroxyl radical (H2O(l) + * → HO* + H+(aq) + e-), which is reduced by ∼0.8 eV after doping with Mo. This study reports on the unique design of a Mo-doped BiVO4@graphene hybrid electrode, which can be used as a superior electrode for green hydrogen generation under sunlight.

Abstract The demand for hydrogen production technology to replace fossil fuels and address the global climate crisis has become one of the most urgent tasks in the modern era. Among the promising breakthroughs, electrochemical water splitting using renewable energy sources offers a path to green hydrogen production that is both feasible and economically viable. However, the current state‐of‐the‐art catalysts for the water‐splitting reaction predominantly rely on scarce and costly noble metals, posing a significant challenge to the mass production of green hydrogen. In this context, two‐dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) have emerged as compelling candidates to replace noble metals, owing to their impressive reactivity and cost‐effectiveness. These TMD‐based electrocatalysts demonstrate exceptional reactivity at their active edge sites, while the basal planes remain catalytically inert. Several tailored strategies can activate these basal planes by modifying the chemical bonding nature and electronic band structure of the constituent atoms, thus enhancing the overall reactivity of TMDs. This review summarizes recent advancements in the modulation methodologies of 2D TMDs to enhance their water‐splitting reactivity. We highlight various chemical modification strategies, including heteroatom doping, defect‐engineering, and heterostructure formation, and provide insights into future research directions for the development of advanced 2D TMD‐based water‐splitting catalysts.

Surface charges of catalysts have important influences on the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Herein, we develop a modified version of the grand-canonical potential kinetics (GCP-K) method based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the effect of surface charges on reaction thermodynamics and kinetics. Using the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the Pt(111) surface as an example, we show how to track the change of surface charge in a reaction and how to analyze its influence on the kinetics. Grand-canonical calculations demonstrate that the optimum hydrogen adsorption energy on Pt under the standard hydrogen electrode condition (SHE) is around −0.2 eV, rather than 0 eV established under the canonical ensemble, due to the high density of surface negative charges. By separating the surface charges that can freely exchange with the external electron reservoir, we obtain a Tafel barrier that is in good agreement with the experimental result. During the Tafel reaction, the net electron inflow into the catalyst leads to a stabilization of canonical energy and a destabilization of the charge-dependent grand-canonical component. This study provides a practical method for obtaining accurate grand-canonical reaction energetics and analyzing the surface charge induced changes.

Abstract The effects of B‐site substitution (B═Mn, Fe, and Co) in La‐based perovskite oxides (LPOs); LaMnO 3 , LaFeO 3 , LaCoO 3 , as bifunctional electrocatalysts during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in metal–air batteries (MABs) under an alkaline electrolyte (pH = 13) are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). It is found that LaMnO 3 exhibits higher ORR activity than others with ORR overpotential ( η ORR ) of 0.57 V, but its OER activity is poor with OER overpotential ( η OER ) of 1.12 V. The η ORR (0.59 V) and η OER (1.13 V) of LaMn 0.75 Fe 0.25 O 3 closely resemble those of LaMnO 3 , suggesting that Fe substitution does not yield appreciable enhancements in activity. Fe substitution reduces the ORR and OER activity because the adsorption energies of intermediate species on Fe‐substituted LPOs surfaces are too strong to obtain a potential determining step for ORR and OER. According to Sabatier's principle, the LaMn 0.25 Co 0.75 O 3 demonstrates superior OER activity compared to the other composition, while ORR activity approximates that of LaMnO 3 , evidenced by η ORR of 0.65 V and η OER of 0.53 V. The Co‐terminated LaMn 0.25 Co 0.75 O 3 shows bifunctional activity higher than Mn/Co termination, indicating that Co is an active site for OER and Mn is a promoter for improved ORR activity.

Ammonia has gained more interest as a promising candidate to produce clean and renewable hydrogen energy in recent years. It is crucial to develop a new and efficient method for improving the performance of NH3 synthesis. Nowadays, electrochemical NH3 synthesis by direct NO reduction has become an alternative to the Haber–Bosch process. Herein, the performance of a NO reduction reaction (NORR) on 33 different H-functionalized MXenes (H-MXenes) has been investigated by the combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Through surface Pourbaix diagrams and Gibbs free-energy calculations, the reaction mechanism and limiting potential (UL) of the NORR on the H-MXenes are investigated. The DFT calculations demonstrate that the surface H could regulate the strength of NO adsorption, lower the free energy of the elemental step, effectively reduce the limiting potential, and hence improve the NORR performance. Furthermore, the results on the LASSO regression indicate a good fitting between the expression consisting of the combined descriptors from 1D to 4D and the UL values from the DFT calculations. Moreover, |Gv−ENO|2|GNO| is regarded as human-readable NORR performance descriptors with R2 = 0.83. This work not only provides a deep insight into the important role of H-functionalization in NORR but also profits to understand the originals of the NORR activity for the high-throughput screening of NH3 synthesis catalysts.

Abstract Designing high‐performance and low‐cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for the conversion and storage of sustainable energy technologies. Inspired by the biomineralization process, we utilized the phosphorylation sites of collagen molecules to combine with cobalt‐based mononuclear precursors at the molecular level and built a three‐dimensional (3D) porous hierarchical material through a bottom‐up biomimetic self‐assembly strategy to obtain single‐atom catalysts confined on carbonized biomimetic self‐assembled carriers (Co SACs/cBSC) after subsequent high‐temperature annealing. In this strategy, the biomolecule improved the anchoring efficiency of the metal precursor through precise functional groups; meanwhile, the binding‐then‐assembling strategy also effectively suppressed the nonspecific adsorption of metal ions, ultimately preventing atomic agglomeration and achieving strong electronic metal‐support interactions (EMSIs). Experimental characterizations confirm that binding forms between cobalt metal and carbonized self‐assembled substrate (Co–O 4 –P). Theoretical calculations disclose that the local environment changes significantly tailored the Co d‐band center, and optimized the binding energy of oxygenated intermediates and the energy barrier of oxygen release. As a result, the obtained Co SACs/cBSC catalyst can achieve remarkable OER activity and 24 h durability in 1 M KOH ( η 10 at 288 mV; Tafel slope of 44 mV dec −1 ), better than other transition metal‐based catalysts and commercial IrO 2 . Overall, we presented a self‐assembly strategy to prepare transition metal SACs with strong EMSIs, providing a new avenue for the preparation of efficient catalysts with fine atomic structures.

Abstract Hydrogen (H 2 ) has been regarded as a promising alternative to fossil‐fuel energy. Green H 2 produced via water electrolysis (WE) powered by renewable energy could achieve a zero‐carbon footprint. Considerable attention has been focused on developing highly active catalysts to facilitate the reaction kinetics and improve the energy efficiency of WE. However, the stability of the electrocatalysts hampers the commercial viability of WE. Few studies have elucidated the origin of catalyst degradation. In this review, we first discuss the WE mechanism, including anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Then, we provide strategies used to enhance the stability of electrocatalysts. After that, the deactivation mechanisms of the typical commercialized HER and OER catalysts, including Pt, Ni, RuO 2 , and IrO 2 , are summarized. Finally, the influence of fluctuating energy on catalyst degradation is highlighted and in situ characterization methodologies for understanding the dynamic deactivation processes are described.

Recently, there has been a notable surge in interest regarding reclaiming valuable chemicals from waste plastics. However, the energy-intensive conventional thermal catalysis does not align with the concept of sustainable development. Herein, we report a sustainable electrocatalytic approach allowing the selective synthesis of glycolic acid (GA) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) over a Pd 67 Ag 33 alloy catalyst under ambient conditions. Notably, Pd 67 Ag 33 delivers a high mass activity of 9.7 A mg Pd −1 for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and GA Faradaic efficiency of 92.7 %, representing the most active catalyst for selective GA synthesis. In situ experiments and computational simulations uncover that ligand effect induced by Ag incorporation enhances the GA selectivity by facilitating carbonyl intermediates desorption, while the lattice mismatch-triggered tensile strain optimizes the adsorption of *OH species to boost reaction kinetics. This work unveils the synergistic of strain and ligand effect in alloy catalyst and provides guidance for the design of future catalysts for PET upcycling. We further investigate the versatility of Pd 67 Ag 33 catalyst on CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) and assemble EGOR//CO 2 RR integrated electrolyzer, presenting a pioneering demonstration for reforming waste carbon resource (i.e., PET and CO 2 ) into high-value chemicals.

The diversity of chemical environments present on unique crystallographic facets can drive dramatic differences in catalytic activity and the reaction mechanism. By coupling experimental investigations of five different IrO2 facets and theory, we characterize the detailed elemental steps of the surface redox processes and the rate-limiting processes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The predicted complex evolution of surface adsorbates and the associated charge transfer as a function of applied potential matches well with the distinct redox features observed experimentally for the five facets. Our microkinetic model from grand canonical quantum mechanics (GC-QM) calculations demonstrates mechanistic differences between nucleophilic attack and O–O coupling across facets, providing the rates as a function of applied potential. These GC-QM calculations explain the higher OER activity observed on the (100), (001), and (110) facets and the lower activity observed for the (101) and (111) facets. This combined study with theory and experiment brings new insights into the structural features that either promote or hinder the OER activity of IrO2, which are expected to provide parallels in structural effects on other oxide surfaces.

The Fe-embedded N-doped graphene (Fe–N–C) is the most representative single atom catalyst (SAC) that has shown great potentiality in electrocatalysis, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the active moiety of Fe–N–C is still elusive due to contradictory experimental results. Moreover, early simulations mainly focus on the thermodynamic potential of adsorbates, while the effect of spin multiplicity receives little attention. To explore the role of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis, we employ the constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) to systematically study the structural evolution of the high-spin (HS) and intermediate-spin (IS) FeN4 site (marked by FeN4HS/IS) in OER and ORR processes. With the consideration of spin multiplicity, our simulation shows spontaneous oxidation from Fe(II)N4IS to Fe(III)N4HS at potential U = 0.4 V versus SHE. Further simulation indicates that the FeN4IS site undergoes a sequential adsorption of *OH and *OOH along with U increase, which leads to the spin state transition from IS to HS. According to the constant-potential free energy analysis, the FeN4HS*OOH is confirmed to be the practical active centers of OER, while the FeN4HS*OH and FeN4IS are assigned to the active center of ORR in low and high overpotentials. The predicted ORR activity of FeN4HS*OH agrees with the in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy measurement by Xiao et al. [Microporous Framework Induced Synthesis of Single-Atom Dispersed Fe-NC Acidic ORR Catalyst and its In Situ Reduced Fe-N4 Active Site Identification Revealed by X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy. ACS Catal. 2018, 8, 2824–2832]. Based on the geometry and orbital analysis, the bond length of Fe–N and coordination number of Fe center are found to have a significant impact on the d orbital splitting energy and thus induce the turnover of HS/IS stability in the OER/ORR intermediates. Our study brings comprehensive insights into the evolution of coordination and spin state in Fe–N–C, which reveals the significance of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis and benefits further theoretical design of SACs from the perspective of spin effects.

Currently, electrochemical water-splitting activity is limited by the slow intrinsic reaction kinetics and energy conversion efficiency, so designing highly efficient electrocatalysts that can facilitate electrochemical reactions remains necessary. Herein, the catalyst architecture consisting of Fe-doped CoS2 nanocages with nitrogen-doped carbon wrapping (CN/Fe-CoS2) was explored as an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst. Through density functional theory calculations, the introduction of Fe into CoS2 would modulate the density of states, making the reduced band gap and enhanced intrinsic charge transfer efficiency of CoS2. Simultaneously, the adsorption of intermediates during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes is regulated, leading to an improvement in the intrinsic catalytic activity. The experimental results demonstrate that Fe doping significantly enhances the electron transfer, specific surface area, and electrochemical active area of CoS2, which facilitates the efficient utilization of charge and exposes additional active sites for electrochemical reactions. In addition, the nanocage architecture and nitrogen-doped carbon wrapping in CN/Fe-CoS2 act as a protective layer to prevent CoS2 aggregation, thereby exposing additional active sites and enhancing the interface with the electrolyte. By optimizing the amount of Fe, CN/Fe-CoS2 demonstrates a remarkably superior electrocatalytic performance and stability, as evidenced by the low overpotential (η10) of 186 and 304 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm–2 in 1.0 M KOH media for HER and OER, respectively. Overall, combining heteroatom doping and structure designing represents a promising approach to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Carbon nitrides are commonly employed as substrates to anchor single metal atoms. Numerous theoretical studies have previously characterized these single-atom systems using the pristine g-C3N4 structure, featuring a C6N7 motif. However, the relatively large pores in g-C3N4 may not effectively coordinate with metal cations, resulting in discordance with the coordination environment determined by experimental characterization. In this study, we introduce a novel model denoted as CN-N4, which preserves the essential g-C3N4 motif, while offering four nitrogen sites for metal binding. Compared with g-C3N4, the binding affinity between the metal and this new substrate model is significantly enhanced, similar to that of a commonly studied nitrogen-doped graphene model (N-gra). Additionally, we have assessed the catalytic performance in various reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CN-N4-supported system exhibits activity comparable to that of the corresponding N-gra-supported species. Fe- and Co-centered SACs can be promising catalysts for ORR, and relatively stable Cu-g-C3N4 is active to HER and CO2RR, consistent with reported experiments. In addition, V-CN-N4 and Rh-CN-N4 are predicted to be candidates to catalyze the HER and ORR, respectively. We suggest that the CN-N4 model aptly captures the local structure of carbon nitride-based materials with a high coordination number, providing an alternative foundation for investigating the reaction mechanisms of these single-atom catalysts.

The coordination engineering of Fe–N–C single-atom catalysts (SACs) through introducing heteroatom dopants has attracted widespread attention in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the common regularity for tuning the ORR activity by coordinated and environmental heteroatoms has not been sufficiently studied. Herein, we study the ORR activity on 100 Fe–N–C SACs with S, P, and B heteroatoms in diverse coordination shells by density functional theory calculations. Based on the energy level distribution of frontier orbits and molecular orbital theory, it is found that the origin of Fe–N–C ORR activity is the hybridization of molecular orbitals of Fe 3dz2, 3dyz (3dxz), and O2*/OH* intermediates, where hybrid orbitals are adjusted by coordinated and environmental S, P, and B heteroatoms, and then the protonation process of O2* or OH* intermediate is determined. Moreover, we found that the Fe–O bond length, the d-orbital gap of spin states, the d-orbital center, and the valence state of the Fe site can be used as structural descriptors to predict the ORR activity governed by the protonation of O2* or OH* intermediate as potential-determining steps. Our structural descriptors rationalize the superior ORR performance of Fe–N–C with S or B atoms doped in the second coordination shell to those in the first coordination shell, as well as the fact that the P heteroatom is more suitable as a coordinated atom than the environmental atom to enhance the ORR activity of Fe–N–C, in available experimental references. Thanks to structural descriptors, the codoping synergistic effect between P in the first coordination shell and S in the second coordination shell is predicted and confirmed to greatly enhance the ORR activity. This study provides a unified mechanistic understanding on the ORR activity trend among Fe–N–C SACs regulated by coordinated and environmental heteroatoms.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key for the transition to a hydrogen-based energy economy. The observed activity of the OER catalysts arises from the combined effects of surface area, intrinsic activity, and stability. Therefore, alloys provide an effective platform to search for catalysts that balance these factors. In particular, high-entropy oxides provide a vast material composition space that could contain catalysts with optimal OER performance. In this work, the OER performance of the AuIrOsPdPtReRhRu composition space was modeled using an experimentally obtained dataset of 350 nanoparticles. This machine-learned model based on experimental data found the optimal catalyst to be a mixture of AuIrOsPdRu. However, as a "black-box model", it cannot explain the underlying chemistry. Therefore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to provide a complementary theoretical model with defined assumptions and, hence, a physical interpretation through comparison with the experimental model. The DFT calculations suggest that the majority of the activity originates from Ru and Ir active sites and that the addition of Pd improves the performance of these sites. However, the DFT calculation did not find the experimentally observed beneficial effects of Au and Os. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Os contributed to the performance of the tested catalysts by roughening the surface, whereas Au fulfilled the role of a structural support. Overall, it is demonstrated how machine learning can help accelerate catalyst discovery, and combining machine-learned models obtained from experimental data with models based on DFT calculations can provide important insights into the complex chemistry of OER catalysts.

Inspired by the distinctive structural and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we conducted comprehensive high-throughput first-principles computations to screen stable 2D chalcogenides X2T (X = transition metals Sc–Hg, totally 29 and main group elements Li–Ba, totally 37; T = S, Se, and Te) with anti-MoS2 configurations in both 1T and 2H phases. Among 396 evaluated candidates, the selected X2T monolayers (X = Sc, Fe, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, IA elements Li–Fr, IIA elements Ca–Ra, N, In, Tl, and Te; T = S, Se, or Te) demonstrate outstanding thermodynamic, dynamic, mechanical properties, and thermal stabilities in 1T/1T′ or 2H phases. These anti-MoS2 variants exhibit diverse characteristics, serving as nonmagnetic/magnetic metals or nonmagnetic/antiferromagnetic semiconductors, often surpassing MoS2 in Young's modulus and/or displaying negative Poisson's ratios. Transition-metal-based monolayers show susceptibility to O2 oxidization, and some show high N2 dissociation activity. Oxygen/nitrogen-terminations can quench TM magnetism and increase band-gaps over their pristine counterparts. Notably, the 2H-Fe2S monolayer maintains robust antiferromagnetism upon O-termination. Moreover, TM-based X2T sheets demonstrate promise as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions. This study expands the diversity of 2D materials with new members and novel functional properties and broadens their potential applications.

ReaxFF is a computationally efficient model for reactive molecular dynamics simulations that has been applied to a wide variety of chemical systems. When ReaxFF parameters are not yet available for a chemistry of interest, they must be (re)optimized, for which one defines a set of training data that the new ReaxFF parameters should reproduce. ReaxFF training sets typically contain diverse properties with different units, some of which are more abundant (by orders of magnitude) than others. To find the best parameters, one conventionally minimizes a weighted sum of squared errors over all of the data in the training set. One of the challenges in such numerical optimizations is to assign weights so that the optimized parameters represent a good compromise among all the requirements defined in the training set. This work introduces a new loss function, called Balanced Loss, and a workflow that replaces weight assignment with a more manageable procedure. The training data are divided into categories with corresponding "tolerances", i.e., acceptable root-mean-square errors for the categories, which define the expectations for the optimized ReaxFF parameters. Through the Log-Sum-Exp form of Balanced Loss, the parameter optimization is also a validation of one's expectations, providing meaningful feedback that can be used to reconfigure the tolerances if needed. The new methodology is demonstrated with a nontrivial parametrization of ReaxFF for water adsorption on alumina. This results in a new force field that reproduces both the rare and frequent properties of a validation set not used for training. We also demonstrate the robustness of the new force field with a molecular dynamics simulation of water desorption from a γ-Al2O3 slab model.

Stretching or compression can induce significant energetic, geometric, and spectroscopic changes in materials. To fully exploit these effects in the design of mechano- or piezo-chromic materials, self-healing polymers, and other mechanoresponsive devices, a detailed knowledge about the distribution of mechanical strain in the material is essential. Within the past decade, Judgement of Energy DIstribution (JEDI) analysis has emerged as a useful tool for this purpose. Based on the harmonic approximation, the strain energy in each bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle of the deformed system is calculated using quantum chemical methods. This allows the identification of the force-bearing scaffold of the system, leading to an understanding of mechanochemical processes at the most fundamental level. Here, we present a publicly available code that generalizes the JEDI analysis, which has previously only been available for isolated molecules. Now, the code has been extended to two- and three-dimensional periodic systems, supramolecular clusters, and substructures of chemical systems under various types of deformation. Due to the implementation of JEDI into the Atomic Simulation Environment, the JEDI analysis can be interfaced with a plethora of program packages that allow the calculation of electronic energies for molecular systems and systems with periodic boundary conditions. The automated generation of a color-coded three-dimensional structure via the Visual Molecular Dynamics program allows insightful visual analyses of the force-bearing scaffold of the strained system.

Abstract The creation of metal‐metal oxide interfaces is an important approach to fine‐tuning catalyst properties through strong interfacial interactions. This article presents the work on developing interfaces between Pt and CeO x that improve Pt surface energetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) within an alkaline electrolyte. The Pt‐CeO x interfaces are formed by depositing size‐controlled Pt nanoparticles onto a carbon support already coated with ultrathin CeO x nanosheets. This interface structure facilitates substantial electron transfer from Pt to CeO x , resulting in decreased hydrogen binding energies on Pt surfaces, and water dissociation for the HER, as predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Electrochemical testing indicates that both Pt specific activity and mass activity are improved by a factor of 2 to 3 following the formation of Pt‐CeO x interfaces. This study underscores the significance and potential of harnessing robust interfacial effects to enhance electrocatalytic reactions.

This research aims to analyze the techno-economic and environmental aspects of retrofitting carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on the existing 330 MWe pulverized coal (PC) power plant. Modeling simulations on existing PC and retrofitting PC CCS with variations in biomass co-firing (wood pellet) were carried out using the Integrated Environment Control Model (IECM) version 11.5 software. An amine-based post-combustion capture was used in this study. Coal and biomass co-firing at PC CCS reduce the net power output and thermal efficiency. Carbon neutrality occurs at 10% biomass co-firing on PC CCS. There was a 164% increase in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), from 0.0487 USD/kWh on PC to 0.1287 USD/kWh on PC CCS. A sensitivity analysis of fuel prices shows that at a fuel price of 25 USD/t, the LCOE of PC CCS is 0.0953 USD/kWh or higher than Indonesia’s national weighted LCOE of 0.0705 USD/kWh. The LCOE of PC CCS can be lower than the national weighted LCOE when the carbon price is higher than 80 USD/t CO2.

The investigation of defects in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are of capital interest for future applications because they strongly change the optical, electronic, or vibrational properties of such materials. In this sense, spectroscopic techniques, such as Raman and photoluminescence, are powerful tools to investigate the optoelectronic properties of crystal defects in two-dimensional TMDs. In this work, we observed that defect-activated Raman modes and bound exciton emissions can be strongly correlated. Specifically, we investigated the impact that sulfur vacancies, produced by focused helium ion beam, have on the electronic and phononic properties of WS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition. The photoluminescence spectra show two new emission peaks related to defects in the crystal structure. The defective nature of these bands were corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which showed new electronic states in the band gap associated with sulfur vacancies. Furthermore, by monitoring the evolution of the Raman spectra as a function of the defect concentration, we observed two new defect activated modes. These bands are explained by a second-order double resonant Raman process, similar to the D band of graphene. Finally, we found out that the defect-related Raman peaks become fully resonant for high defect concentrations. It turns out that degenerate electronic states split in two separated levels for high defect concentrations that are involved in the resonance of the Raman processes.

The interaction of a titanium carbide nanoparticle with aluminum (100), (110), and (111) substrates is investigated within the density functional theory. The nanoparticle–substrate interaction energies are determined; the electron density distribution and the electron localization function between aluminum, titanium, and carbon atoms are analyzed. It has been established that the atoms in the upper layers of the aluminum (100) and (110) substrates are significantly displaced relative to their initial positions as a result of the interaction with the nanoparticle, whereas a minor displacement of atoms is typical for the (111) substrate. The interaction between aluminum and carbon atoms at the Al–TiC interface is due to the formation of covalent Al–C chemical bonds. The aluminum atoms forming carbide bonds do not form chemical bonds with titanium atoms. The aluminum atoms that are adjacent to the titanium atoms and are not involved in the formation of carbide bonds form metallic Al–Ti bonds.

Рассмотрены как четырех-, так и двухэлектронный ассоциативный механизм реакции. Расчеты выполнены в большом каноническом ансамбле при фиксированном потенциале электрода. Показано, что расчеты при фиксированном потенциале дают существенное отличие от общепринятого расчета при фиксированном заряде поверхности. Обнаружено, что электрокаталитическое действие азотной примеси связано с ростом энергии хемосорбции интермедиата OOH, что снижает энергию реакции протонирования молекулы кислорода. Также показано, что в щелочной среде азотная примесь ингибирует двухэлектронный механизм реакции.

Nickel manganese oxide nanoparticles (NiMnO3 NPs) have been synthesized by a solution combustion method, varying the metal-to-fuel ratios. The obtained compounds were characterized by several techniques, including X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, FESEM and HR-TEM. The optical band gap decreased with increasing crystallite size. The BET analysis revealed a decrease in surface area with increasing crystallite size. Crystallite size dependent electrochemical investigations of the NiMnO3 NPs were carried out using a three-electrode system. The NiMnO3 NPs were observed to be a better supercapacitor material with a specific capacitance of 65.45 F/g at 1 A/g. The specific capacitance decreased linearly with the cumulative current densities, which is the characteristic behavior of electrochemical supercapacitors. The degradation of RB increased with the enhancement in the crystallinity of the sample. The proportion of RB dye degradation was found to be 99.89% in two hours. The enhancement of photodegradation and the supercapacitor property of the NiMnO3 NPs are attributed to the reduction in the band gap due to increase in crystallite size.

Within computational heterogeneous catalysis, two critical factors exist─coverage and multifaceted effects─which are challenging to incorporate and contribute to differences between the results obtained from computational and experimental studies. Such disparities exist when significant adsorbate–adsorbate interactions are present, particularly when coupled with computationally limited facet sampling. Here, we designed a study to demonstrate the significance of coverage and facet effects on the predicted coverages for O* and H* on Pt nanoparticles. This is accomplished by employing multiscale modeling techniques using a three-pronged approach consisting of density functional theory (DFT), ab initio phase diagrams, and mean-field microkinetic models. Overall, adsorbate–adsorbate interactions are repulsive and far stronger for O*/Pt than for H*/Pt. For O* on Pt(111), repulsive interactions are both two- and three-body, but on Pt(100) and Pt(110), they are predominantly three-body. Through benchmarks to existing experimental literature, we demonstrate that experimentally observed coverages and desorption temperatures can be accurately estimated by computational models when the adsorbate–adsorbate interactions are included. Finally, by combining microkinetic models at the equilibrium limit with kubic harmonic interpolation, we model the impacts of the treatment of adsorbate–adsorbate interactions on the predicted O* and H* coverages over multifaceted Pt nanoparticles. Omitting adsorbate–adsorbate interactions over Pt nanoparticles leads to an overestimation of equilibrium coverages of the adsorbates (maximum of 0.29 and 0.11 ML for O* and H*, respectively) across a wide range of temperatures and pressures relevant to heterogeneous catalysis. Altogether, our work demonstrates that the inclusion of coverage and facet effects increases the accuracy of computational models for heterogeneous catalysts.

The development of highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on more cost-effective and earth-abundant elements is of great significance and still faces a huge challenge. In this work, a series of transition metal (TM) embedding a newly-defined monolayer carbon nitride phase is theoretically profiled and constructed as a catalytic platform for OER studies. Typically, a four-step screening strategy was proposed to rapidly identified high performance candidates and the coordination structure and catalytic performance relationship was thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the eliminating criterion was established to condenses valid range based on the Gibbs free energy of OH*. Our results reveal that the as-constructed 2FeCN/P exhibits superior activity toward OER with an ultralow overpotential of 0.25 V, at the same time, the established 3FeCN/S configuration performed well as a bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysis with extremely low overpotential ηOER/ηORR of 0.26/0.48 V. Overall, this work provides an effective framework for screening advanced OER catalysts, which can also be extended to other complex multistep catalytic reactions.

Abstract The structure–property hypothesis says that the properties of all materials are determined by an underlying crystal structure. The main obstacle was the ambiguity of conventional crystal representations based on incomplete or discontinuous descriptors that allow false negatives or false positives. This ambiguity was resolved by the ultra-fast pointwise distance distribution, which distinguished all periodic structures in the world’s largest collection of real materials (Cambridge structural database). State-of-the-art results in property prediction were previously achieved by graph neural networks based on various graph representations of periodic crystals, including the Crystal Graph with vertices at all atoms in a crystal unit cell. This work adapts the pointwise distance distribution for a simpler graph whose vertex set is not larger than the asymmetric unit of a crystal structure. The new Distribution Graph reduces mean absolute error by 0.6–12% while having 44–88% of the number of vertices when compared to the Crystal Graph when applied on the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT datasets using CGCNN and ALIGNN. Methods for hyper-parameters selection for the graph are backed by the theoretical results of the pointwise distance distribution and are then experimentally justified.
