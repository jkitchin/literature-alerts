Electrocatalysts play a critical role in energy technologies, but the development of active, efficient, and durable catalysts is impeded by the lack of methodologies to deconvolute the complex interplay between various aspects influencing the activity of the catalysts, e.g., the number of active sites, turnover frequency, and the reaction pathways. Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) is an emerging tool for the analysis of electroactive species and has been successfully applied to a variety of reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and hydrogen oxidation reaction. The harmonics generated from FTacV measurements neatly detect underlaying processes not visible by other, more commonly employed techniques for analysis of electrocatalysts, such as the rotating disc electrode and dc voltammetry. The harmonic components enable separating overlapping processes based on differences in kinetics or linearity of response. This paper presents a review of FTacV applied for the analysis of electrocatalysts. It highlights the importance of determining the electrochemically active site density (EASD) to decipher the intrinsic activity of a catalyst and discusses the use of FTacV in dynamic determination of the EASD over the course of a catalyst's working life, as well as the use of FTacV to understand intricate catalytic processes.

High-entropy materials (HEMs), a new type of materials, have attracted significant attention in the field of electrocatalytic reactions, batteries and energy-storage materials over the past few years owing to their unique structure, controllable elementary composition, and adjustable properties. These excellent characteristics result from four major factors: high entropy, sluggish-diffusion, severe lattice distortion, and cocktail effect, and are used widely in energy-energy applications. This review aims to summarize the recent progress of HEMs in electrochemical energy-storage. We begin with the concept, structure, and four core effects of HEMs that provide the basic information on HEMs. Next, we discuss the major properties of HEMs and analyze the relationship between their structures and properties. Furthermore, we highlight the outstanding performance of HEMs in hydrogen storage, electrode materials of batteries, catalysis, and supercapacitors, and briefly explain the mechanisms of these materials that are crucial in energy storage and conversion. This review will assist in understanding the excellent energy-storage properties, intricacies of the phase structures, elemental interactions, and reaction mechanisms associated with HEMs. Moreover, challenges and future development prospects are summarized. This work will provide insight into the factors that are crucial for designing HEMs with energy storage properties.

Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity play a crucial role in biosensing, disease treatment, environmental management, and other fields. However, their development is impeded by a vast range of tunable properties in components and structures, making the establishment of structure–effect relationships and the discovery of active materials challenging. Addressing this, we established robust scaling relationships by meticulously analyzing the catalytic reaction networks of pure metal NPs, which laid the volcano-shaped correlation between the activity and O* adsorption energy. Utilizing these relationships, we introduced an innovative and versatile descriptor of the NPs, which was then integrated into a machine learning-accelerated high-throughput computational workflow, significantly boosting the predictive accuracy for the POD-like activity of bimetallic NPs. Our methodological approach enabled the successful prediction of activities for 1260 bimetallic NPs, leading to the identification of several highly effective catalysts. Furthermore, we distilled several strategies for designing efficient bimetallic NPs based on our screening results.

Advancements in fuel cells and water electrolyzers have significantly bolstered the utilization of hydrogen energy. Notably, the oxidation and reduction processes of oxygen at the electrode—termed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)—manifest sluggish reaction kinetics, thus requiring noble metals as catalysts, which considerably impedes system efficiency and cost. The imperative for enhancing reaction rates and diminishing overpotential necessitates the development of effective catalysts, which strongly depends on the mechanistic understanding of these reactions at the molecular level. Therefore, this review summarizes our recent efforts in utilizing in situ enhanced Raman spectroscopy, especially the borrowing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) strategy, shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), and the SHINERS-satellite strategy, to capture oxygen intermediate species as a bridge to investigate the molecular mechanisms of OER and ORR. Combining in situ SERS with other characterization techniques and theoretical simulation, the structural evolution of active sites and intermediates, including ∗OOH, ∗OH, ∗OO, etc., during OER/ORR has been monitored under reaction conditions, and the reaction mechanisms together with structure-activity correlations have been identified at the molecular level. These findings may provide a pivotal scientific foundation towards the discovery of better materials for electrochemical hydrogen energy.

The pursuit of efficient photocatalysts toward photocatalytic water splitting has attracted wide attention. However, the low efficiency of photocatalytic reactions due to the rapid electron-hole recombination and the time-consuming searching process hinder the development of high-performance photocatalysts.

Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate the influence of the external electric field on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of monolayer Fe3GeTe2. Monolayer Fe3GeTe2 has ferromagnetic metal properties and displays excellent electrocatalytic activity. The magnetism mainly comes from FeI atoms, owing to the strong Fe-Te orbitals hybridization, and FeI atoms have great effect on the active site Te atoms. The electric field induces the change of spin-electron and promotes charge redistribution in the Fe3GeTe2, resulting in the changes of the magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropic energy (MAE). Simultaneously, the applied electric field shifts the energy band and decreases the work function which facilitates carrier migration to the surface. Therefore, the OER overpotential is reduced and the catalytic performance is improved. These valuable findings can serve as vital references for the design of 2D magnetic electrocatalysts.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a crucial semireaction in water electrolysis and rechargeable metal-air batteries, is vital for carbon neutrality. Hindered by a slow proton-coupled electron transfer, an efficient catalyst activating the formation of an O-H bond is essential. Here, we proposed a straightforward one-step hydrothermal procedure for fabricating PO

Abstract It is still a challenge to develop electrocatalyst for the efficient adsorption and conversion of organic molecule in aqueous media. Herein, a hetero‐interface structure based on CuO@Ni(OH) 2 is rationally designed to enhance the performance of benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzoic acid. A high Faradaic efficiency of 99% and the yield of 3.09 mmol cm −2 h −1 are achieved at 1.70 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming the previously reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, a membrane‐free flow electrolyzer was assembled based on CuO@Ni(OH) 2 hetero‐interface, exhibiting a much high yielding of benzoic acid (6.73 mmol cm −2 h −1 ) and hydrogen (0.35 L cm −2 h −1 ) with excellent stability. Both experimental data and density functional theory calculations verify that the electron is tend to accumulate at the hetero‐interface, thus accelerating the adsorption of reactant and intermediate and reducing the energy barrier of the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid.

Abstract Graphene supported electrocatalysts have demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, their durability and cycling performance are greatly limited by Oswald ripening of platinum (Pt) and graphene support corrosion. Moreover, comprehensive studies on the mechanisms of catalysts degradation under 0.6–1.6 V versus RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) is still lacking. Herein, degradation mechanisms triggered by different defects on graphene supports are investigated by two cycling protocols. In the start–up/shutdown cycling (1.0–1.6 V vs. RHE), carbon oxidation reaction (COR) leads to shedding or swarm–like aggregation of Pt nanoparticles (NPs). Theoretical simulation results show that the expansion of vacancy defects promotes reaction kinetics of the decisive step in COR, reducing its reaction overpotential. While under the load cycling (0.6–1.0 V vs. RHE), oxygen containing defects lead to an elevated content of Pt in its oxidation state which intensifies Oswald ripening of Pt. The presence of vacancy defects can enhance the transfer of electrons from graphene to the Pt surface, reducing the d−band center of Pt and making it more difficult for the oxidation state of platinum to form in the cycling. This work will provide comprehensive understanding on Pt/Graphene catalysts degradation mechanisms.

In this study, nickel ferrite (NiFe 2 O 4 ) nanoparticles were synthesized using the hydrothermal method at various pH values. The objective was to investigate the influence of pH variation on particle size and electrocatalytic activity. The formation of cubic phase nanoparticles was confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. To characterize the electrochemical properties, the nickel ferrite nanoparticles were coated onto a stainless steel substrate using the doctor blade technique. The microstructural analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The samples were further analyzed using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The average crystallite size, determined from the XRD pattern, was approximately 40 nm. SEM images revealed a conversion from nanoplates to a granular morphology. The synthesized electrode exhibited an overpotential of 392 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 and demonstrated good stability for 5 hours. These findings highlight the excellent electrocatalytic activity of nickel ferrite nanoparticles for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Abstract The proactive exploration of electrocatalytic conversion for renewable energy valorization is of tremendous significance in addressing the issues of fossil energy exhaustion, among which the critical challenge of electrocatalysis lies in the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts that are rich in the earth. Among electrocatalysts, the design of heterostructured materials exhibits immense potential for the optimization of noble metals and elaboration of non‐precious metal electrocatalysts with durability. In this review, a systematic overview of modern advances in heterostructured electrocatalysts for a range of energy conversion reactions is described, and special interfacial design brings additional functional effects. Subsequently, various synthesis methods and characterization techniques for heterostructured electrocatalysts are also summarized. The innovative classification of heterostructures in methods of interfacial junction, crystal structure, structural morphology, and properties of the components is presented in this review. Finally, the possible challenges and outlooks of heterostructured electrocatalysts in the future are further discussed, including how to develop more sophisticated synthesis, characterization, and theoretical calculation methods, which will serve as the guiding direction for a more rational interface design. This review aims to set the trajectory for providing meaningful inspiration and references in energy conversion by heterostructured electrocatalysts, advancing the process of carbon neutrality.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer an interesting opportunity for catalysis, particularly for metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) motifs by providing an organized porous structural pattern and well-defined active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key need for hydrogen fuel cells and related sustainable energy technologies. In this work, we leverage electrochemical testing with computational models to study the electronic and structural properties in the MOF systems and their relationship to ORR activity and stability based on dual transitional metal centers. The MOFs consist of two M1 metals with amine nodes coordinated to a single M2 metal with a phthalocyanine linker, where M1/M2 = Co, Ni, or Cu. Co-based metal centers, in particular Ni–Co, demonstrate the highest overall activity of all nine tested MOFs. Computationally, we identify the dominance of Co sites, relative higher importance of the M2 site, and the role of layer M1 interactions on the ORR activity. Selectivity measurements indicate that M1 sites of MOFs, particularly Co, exhibit the lowest (<4%), and Ni demonstrates the highest (>46%) two-electron selectivity, in good agreement with computational studies. Direct in situ stability characterization, measuring dissolved metal ions, and calculations, using an alkaline stability metric, confirm that Co is the most stable metal in the MOF, while Cu exhibits notable instability at the M1. Overall, this study reveals how atomistic coupling of electronic and structural properties affects the ORR performance of dual site MOF catalysts and opens new avenues for the tunable design and future development of these systems for practical electrochemical applications.

Abstract Neutral electrolysis to produce hydrogen is prime challenging owing to the sluggish kinetics of water dissociation for the electrochemical reduction of water to molecular hydrogen. An ion‐enriched electrode/electrolyte interface for electrocatalytic reactions can efficiently obtain a stable electrolysis system. Herein, we found that interfacial accumulated fluoride ions and the anchored Pt single atoms/nanoparticles in catalysts can improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of NiFe‐based hydroxide catalysts, prolonging the operating stability at high current density in neutral conditions. NiFe hydroxide electrode obtains an outstanding performance of 1000 mA cm −2 at low overpotential of 218 mV with 1000 h operation at 100 mA cm −2 . Electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the interfacial fluoride contributes to promote the adsorption of Pt to proton for sustaining a large current density at low potential, while the Pt single atoms/nanoparticles provide H adsorption sites. The synergy effect of F and Pt species promotes the formation of Pt─H and F─H bonds, which accelerate the adsorption and dissociation process of H 2 O and promote the HER reaction with a long‐term durability in neutral conditions.

Abstract The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has the potential to decarbonize industrial ammonia production. However, NRR has poor activity and selectivity versus the competing hydrogen evolution reaction for catalysts that adhere to scaling relations. Overcoming the limitations imposed by scaling relations requires more complex catalyst materials, however, evaluating materials beyond simple metal systems is a large combinatorial problem that requires an improved understanding of the electrocatalyst surface to rationally guide the discovery of superior catalysts. The study uses grand canonical density functional theory to uncover NRR trends on a large and disparate set of binary covalent alloys (BCA) with variable compositions and active‐site geometries. The studied BCAs generally follow scaling relations, albeit with larger variance and several systems that significantly break scaling. BCAs with early‐ to mid‐transition metals tend to lie near the volcano peak and activate the N 2 triple bond via a side‐on binding configuration. Trends in the BCA space cannot be readily predicted using simple electronic descriptors, which is ascribed to the large geometric variability of the BCA surfaces. It is anticipated that these findings will provide a foundation for the rational design of superior NRR electrocatalysts with increasing material complexity.

Abstract Surface defect-induced photoluminescence blinking is ubiquitous in lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs). Despite efforts to passivate the defects on perovskite QDs by chemically engineering ligand binding moieties, blinking accompanied by photodegradation still poses barriers to studying and implementing quantum-confined perovskite QDs in quantum emitters. We posited that the intermolecular interaction between ligands can affect the QD surface passivation. In the solid state, steric repulsions among bulky ligand tails prevent adequate QD surface ligand coverage. Alternatively, attractive π-π stacking between low-steric phenethylammonium (PEA) ligands promotes the formation of a nearly epitaxial surface ligand layer. Here, we demonstrate that single CsPbBr3 QDs covered by these PEA ligands are nearly non-blinking, with single photon purity reaching 98%. Moreover, these QDs exhibited no spectral shifting and photodegradations, and they remained blinking-free after 12 hours of continuous operation. Free of interferences from blinking and photodegradation, we present size-dependent exciton radiative rates and emission line widths of single CsPbBr3 QDs ranging from strongly to weakly confined regimes.

Effect of solvent at the water/solid interface plays a non-negligible role in chemical reactions. Explicit solvation has been proved for its important effect on thermodynamics and kinetics of catalytic reactions. However, systematic studies about this perspective are still absence. In this work, using the model of single platinum atom immobilized on the metal vacancies of a series of MXenes, we systematically investigate the implicit/explicit solvent effect on their catalytic performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We find that the solvent effect plays a significant role in affecting the calculation results for some systems. For TiNbC-PtNb, the value of ΔGH* decreases from -0.121 to -0.511 (-0.583) eV when considering implicit (explicit) correction, implying the decisive role of solvent effect for calculating HER in this system. Bader charge analysis and AIMD simulations reveal that TiNbC-PtNb surface is sensitive to H2O, thus causing this abnormal case. Surprisingly high-entropy phases of MXene overall are less sensitive to solvent compared to the pure phases, which could be due to their alloyed lattice with a strong ability against electronic and lattice fluctuations induced by solvent. Several systems like V2C-PtV, TiMoC-PtMo, and VNbC-PtV are predicted to be excellent electrocatalysts for alkaline HER with the appropriate Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and kinetic barrier of water. The perspective exemplified in this work highlights that more feasible operando should be considered, e.g., influence of water, to better simulate the reaction process. Our work suggests that Pt-doped MXenes are perfect systems for hosting atomic catalyst as well.

In this work, we investigate how exploiting symmetry when creating and modifying structural models may speed up global atomistic structure optimization. We propose a search strategy in which models start from high symmetry configurations and then gradually evolve into lower symmetry models. The algorithm is named cascading symmetry search and is shown to be highly efficient for a number of known surface reconstructions. We use our method for the sulfur-induced Cu (111) (43×43) surface reconstruction for which we identify a new highly stable structure that conforms with the experimental evidence.

Abstract Periodic material or crystal property prediction using machine learning has grown popular in recent years as it provides a computationally efficient replacement for classical simulation methods. A crucial first step for any of these algorithms is the representation used for a periodic crystal. While similar objects like molecules and proteins have a finite number of atoms and their representation can be built based upon a finite point cloud interpretation, periodic crystals are unbounded in size, making their representation more challenging. In the present work, we adapt the Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD), a continuous and generically complete isometry invariant for periodic point sets, as a representation for our learning algorithm. The PDD distinguished all (more than 660 thousand) periodic crystals in the Cambridge Structural Database as purely periodic sets of points without atomic types. We develop a transformer model with a modified self-attention mechanism that combines PDD with compositional information via a spatial encoding method. This model is tested on the crystals of the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT databases and shown to produce accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods while being several times faster in both training and prediction time.
