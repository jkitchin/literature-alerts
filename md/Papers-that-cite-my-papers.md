The transformative impact of modern computational paradigms and technologies, such as high-performance computing (HPC), quantum computing, and cloud computing, has opened up profound new opportunities for scientific simulations. Scalable computational chemistry is one beneficiary of this technological progress. The main focus of this paper is on the performance of various quantum chemical formulations, ranging from low-order methods to high-accuracy approaches, implemented in different computational chemistry packages and libraries, such as NWChem, NWChemEx, Scalable Predictive Methods for Excitations and Correlated Phenomena, ExaChem, and Fermi–Löwdin orbital self-interaction correction on Azure Quantum Elements, Microsoft's cloud services platform for scientific discovery. We pay particular attention to the intricate workflows for performing complex chemistry simulations, associated data curation, and mechanisms for accuracy assessment, which is demonstrated with the Arrows automated workflow for high throughput simulations. Finally, we provide a perspective on the role of cloud computing in supporting the mission of leadership computational facilities.

Catalysis of multicomponent transformations requires controlled assembly of reactants within the active site. Supramolecular scaffolds possess synthetic microenvironments that enable precise modulation over noncovalent interactions (NCIs) engaged by reactive, encapsulated species. While molecular properties that describe the behavior of single guests in host cavities have been studied extensively, multicomponent transformations remain challenging to design and deploy. Here, simple univariate regression and threshold analyses are employed to model reactivity in a cascade reduction of azaarenes catalyzed by water-soluble metal organic cages. Yield and stereoselectivity models help deduce unknown mechanisms of reactivity by the multicomponent, host–guest complexes. Furthermore, a comprehensive model is established for NCIs driving stereoselectivity in the reported host–guest adducts.

To quickly and efficiently screen catalytic materials with both activity and selectivity for the nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR), we adopted a strategy that considers the activity of the side reaction hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) first. It can be seen that Fe3(THT)2 (THT = triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexathiol) has extremely excellent HER activity, with a Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of 0.007 eV. Based on the relationship between ΔG and theoretical exchange current density, all TM3(THT)2 can be divided into two regions: one is the absolute values of ΔG greater than 1 eV, the other is the absolute values of ΔG greater than 0 eV and less than 1eV. Obviously, the candidates with the absolute values of ΔG greater than 1 eV have poor HER performance, but this precisely provides the possibility of obtaining NORR catalytic materials with both excellent selectivity and activity. Subsequent calculation results show that the maximum ΔG change of the rate-determining step of Ta3(THT)2 is unexpectedly only 0.05 eV. Therefore, Ta3(THT)2 may be regarded as the NORR catalytic material with both excellent performance and selectivity. Based on the electron transfer and partial density of states (PDOS) analysis, it can be seen that Ta plays a crucial role in the activation stage of NO. The approach that considers the activity of the side reaction HER first may provide a new idea for rapidly screening highly selective and active NORR catalysts.

Abstract Hydrogen energy from electrocatalysis driven by sustainable energy has emerged as a solution against the background of carbon neutrality. Proton exchange membrane (PEM)‐based electrocatalytic systems represent a promising technology for hydrogen production, which is equipped to combine efficiently with intermittent electricity from renewable energy sources. In this review, PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems for H 2 production are summarized systematically from low to high operating temperature systems. When the operating temperature is below 130°C, the representative device is a PEM water electrolyzer; its core components and respective functions, research status, and design strategies of key materials especially in electrocatalysts are presented and discussed. However, strong acidity, highly oxidative operating conditions, and the sluggish kinetics of the anode reaction of PEM water electrolyzers have limited their further development and shifted our attention to higher operating temperature PEM systems. Increasing the temperature of PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems can cause an increase in current density, accelerate reaction kinetics and gas transport and reduce the ohmic value, activation losses, Δ G H* , and power consumption. Moreover, further increasing the operating temperature (120–300°C) of PEM‐based devices endows various hydrogen carriers (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and ammonia) with electrolysis, offering a new opportunity to produce hydrogen using PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems. Finally, several future directions and prospects for developing PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems for H 2 production are proposed through devoting more efforts to the key components of devices and reduction of costs.

Abstract Designing spinel nanocrystals (NCs) with tailored structural composition and cation distribution is crucial for superior catalytic performance but remarkably challenging due to their intricate nature. Here, an aggregation growth restricted hot‐injection method is presented by meticulously investigating the fundamental nucleation and aggregation‐driven growth kinetics governing spinel NC formation to address this challenge. Through controlled collision probability of nuclei during growth, this approach enables the synthesis of spinel NCs with unprecedented, single nanometer (1.2 nm). Single‐nanometer CoMn 2 O 4 spinel via this method exhibits a highly tailored structure with a maximized population of highly active octahedral Mn atoms, thereby optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, it exhibits a remarkable half‐wave potential of 0.88 V in ORR and leads to a superior power density (170.9 mW cm −2 ) in zinc–air battery, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most reported spinel oxides, revealing a clear structure–property relationship. This structure design strategy is readily adaptable for the precise synthesis and engineering of various spinel structures, opening new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts and energy storage materials.

We uncover the origin of unique electronic structures of single-atom alloys (SAAs) by interpretable deep learning. The approach integrates tight-binding moment theory with graph neural networks to accurately describe the local electronic structure of transition and noble metal sites upon perturbation. We emphasize the complex interplay of interatomic orbital coupling and on-site orbital resonance, which shapes the d-band characteristics of an active site, shedding light on the origin of free-atom-like d-states that are often observed in SAAs involving d10 metal hosts. This theory-infused neural network approach significantly enhances our understanding of the electronic properties of single-site catalytic materials beyond traditional theories.

Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is a versatile and zero‐emission material that is widely used in the industrial, domestic, and healthcare sectors. It is clear that it plays a critical role in advancing environmental sustainability, acting as a green energy source, and protecting human health. Conventional production techniques focused on anthraquinone oxidation, however, electrocatalytic synthesis has arisen as a means of utilizing renewable energy sources in conjunction with available resources like oxygen and water. These strides represent a substantial change toward more environmentally and energy‐friendly H 2 O 2 manufacturing techniques that are in line with current environmental and energy goals. This work reviews recent advances in two‐electron water oxidation reaction (2e‐WOR) electrocatalysts, including design principles and reaction mechanisms, examines catalyst design alternatives and experimental characterization techniques, proposes standardized assessment criteria, investigates the impact of the interfacial milieu on the reaction, and discusses the value of in situ characterization and molecular dynamics simulations as a supplement to traditional experimental techniques and theoretical simulations, as shown in Figure 1. The review also emphasizes the importance of device design, interface, and surface engineering in improving the production of H 2 O 2 . Through adjustments to the chemical microenvironment, catalysts can demonstrate improved performance, opening the door for commercial applications that are scalable through tandem cell development.

Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction into value-added products is crucial for a green economy. Inspired by the recent experimental synthesis of biphenylene (BPH) and the excellent catalytic activity of copper dispersed on two-dimensional (2D) materials, we chose to systematically investigate the pristine, defective, and Cu-decorated BPH for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to value-added hydrocarbons. It is observed that the CO2 molecules bind weakly to the pristine BPH, indicating their chemical inertness. Carbon single-vacancy defects facilitate CO2 adsorption with a strong binding energy (Eb) of −3.23 eV, detrimental to the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) mechanism. We have further investigated the binding energy and kinetic stability of Cu-decorated BPH as a single-atom-catalyst (SAC). The molecular dynamics simulations confirm the kinetic stability, revealing that the Cu-atom avoids agglomeration under low metal dispersal conditions. The CO2 molecule gets adsorbed horizontally on the Cu-BPH surface with a ΔEb of −0.52 eV. The CRR mechanism is investigated using two pathways beginning with two different initial states, formate (*OCOH) and carboxylic (*COOH). The formate pathway confirms the conversion of *OCOH to *HCOOH with the rate-limiting potential (UL) of 0.39 eV for the production of HCOOH, while for the carboxylic pathway, the conversion of *COH to *CHOH has a UL of 0.32 eV, eventually producing CH3OH. Our findings highlight the role of Cu-BPH as an efficient SAC for CO2 catalytic activity to C1 products, as compared to the state-of-the-art Cu, and holds promise as an electrocatalyst for CRR.

Hydrogen has been widely used in industrial and commercial applications as a carbon-free, efficient energy source. Due to the high flammability and explosion risk of hydrogen–air mixtures, it is vital to develop sensors featuring fast-responding and high sensitivity for hydrogen leakage detection. This paper presents a miniaturized electrochemical gas sensor by elaborately establishing a nanocomposite and thin ionic liquid interface for highly sensitive and rapid electrochemical detection of hydrogen, in which a remarkable response time and recovery time of approximately 6 s was achieved at room temperature. A screen-printed carbon electrode was modified with a reduced graphene oxide–carbon nanotube (rGO-CNT) hybrid and platinum–palladium (Pt–Pd) bimetallic nanoparticles to realize high sensitivity. To achieve miniaturization and high stability of the sensor, a thin-film room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) was employed as the electrolyte with a significantly decreased response time. The fast-responding hydrogen sensor demonstrates excellent performance with high sensitivity, linearity, and repeatability at concentrations below the lower explosive limit of 4 vol %. The engineered high-performance interface and gas sensor provide a promising and effective strategy for gas sensor design and rapid hazardous gas monitoring.

Abstract Both commercially available and laboratory-synthesized IrO2 catalysts typically possess rutile-type structures and diverse facet orientations. According to the theoretical results from density functional theory calculations, distinct IrO2 facets will result in divergent electrocatalytic properties, among which the (101) crystal facet is theoretically predicted as the most energetically favorable for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to its lowest energy barrier. Maintaining a single-unit-cell thickness while exposing a desired facet of 2D IrO2 presents a significant opportunity and challenge for the development of high-performance OER anode catalysts. Herein, we develop an ammonia-induced facet engineering for oriented modulation of crystal facets in the ultimate limit of monolayer thickness, and successfully synthesize 2D monolayer IrO2 exposing unique (101) facet. At the current density of 10 mA cm-2geo, an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV has been achieved on the highly activated (101) facet in a three-electrode system. More importantly, in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, the IrO2 anode reaches a low voltage of 1.74 V at an industrial-level current density of 2 A cm-2geo, much lower than that of all commercial IrO2 electrocatalysts. Though facet engineering primarily contributes to modulating the intrinsic activity rather than stability, the as-prepared IrO2(101) monolayer performs over 8,000 hours of PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) stability at constant 1.5 A cm-2geo, with a negligible decay rate of 4.0 mV kh-1. Furthermore, even a long-term PEMWE test of 1000 h using the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with ultra-low Ir loading of 0.2 mgIr cm-2geo under fluctuating operating conditions is performed, ECell remains highly electrochemically stable over time at 1.5 A cm-2geo, without any signs of catalyst degradation. This work proposes that ammonia-induced facet engineering of 2D monolayer IrO2 could represent a novel approach to selectively expose the desired (101) facet, thereby enabling unique facet-dependent OER performance and ultrahigh stability in industrial-scale PEM electrolysis, even under voltage fluctuations generated by solar and wind power.

Abstract The exploration of a new conceptual strategy for improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of earth‐abundant electrocatalysts is critical. In this study, chiral copper oxide nanoflower is explored by a self‐assembly method. The characterization suggests the chiral structure originates from the crystal plane‐level helical stack of the secondary nanosheets. Of note, the assembly illustrates a record‐high degree of spin polarization of 96%, indicating the ideal alignment of electron spin. Moreover, density function theory calculations show the chiral structure reducing the reaction energy barrier (REB) while switching the potential‐determining step from *O→*OOH to *OH→*O. Together with the enhanced electrochemical active surface area and accelerated charge transfer, the production of ground‐state triplet O 2 is improved via a spin‐forbidden route that involves the singlet H 2 O/OH•. Consequently, the chiral nanoflower shows a overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 93.5 mV dec −1 , which is even superior to the commercial RuO 2 (310 mV, 101 mV dec −1 ). This study presents a new strategy for improving the OER activity by simultaneously enhancing electronic properties and lowering the REB of an non‐noble electrocatalyst via chirality engineering.

Abstract The development of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts is essential for hydrogen production from acidic water splitting. Herein, a TiO 2 nanotube‐loaded Co‐doped Ru nanoparticle catalyst (RuCo/TiO 2 NTs) is reported that exhibits excellent activity and stability toward acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Ru─O─Ti bonding is enhanced by Co doping, and the metal carrier interaction between Ru nanoparticles and TiO 2 NTs is enhanced, which effectively stabilizes Ru species during OER and initiates hydrogen spillover accelerating HER kinetics. As a result, RuCo/TiO 2 NTs catalyst requires only 156 mV OER overpotential and 17 mV HER overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 with a stability more than 500 h in acidic conditions. More importantly, benefiting from the excellent bifunctional activities, the proton exchange membrane electrolyte assembled from RuCo/TiO 2 NTs has excellent activity and robust stability (1000 h). This work opens a new avenue for the efficient energy conversion devices.

Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) can be very effective for catalyzing both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we present theoretical evidence of a new class of highly active DACs, namely, the double-atom embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene sheet 2M-N-C (M = Mn, Fe) on the basis of density functional theory calculations. Importantly, we find that the double active sites of 2M-N-C DACs entail an unconventional catalytic reaction pathway for ORR and OER. We also show that the local coordination environment of the active sites can significantly affect the stability and oxygen catalytic activity of 2M-N-C DACs. In particular, MnFe-N-C DAC not only exhibits good stability but also possesses outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic activity with the potential difference (Δ

In this study, deuterium boride (DB) nanosheets were synthesized as deuterated borophane through the ion exchange of magnesium cations in magnesium diboride with deuterons from a deuterium-type ion-exchange resin in acetonitrile. The Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectrum of DB exhibited clear isotope effects, namely the shift in the absorption peak of the B-H stretching vibrational mode to a lower wavenumber. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) from a mixture of DB and hydrogen boride (HB) nanosheets yielded a more intense hydrogen-deuterium (HD) signal compared to the H

Abstract Electro‐valorization of biomass‐derived chemicals has ensured sustainable production of value‐added products, an effective approach for reducing carbon footprint, through renewable energy. Electrochemical oxidation and reduction reactions in aqueous media using H 2 O as a potential source for active hydrogenated and oxygenated species fulfill the purpose. In this study, Ru─Co 2 P nanorods are explored as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward valorization of Organics at basic media. The in‐situ electrogenerated Co 3+ and Co 4+ species act as active oxidants toward product selectivity. An overpotential of 68 mV is found for hydrogen evolution reaction (1 m NaOH) with Ru─Co 2 P. Further, used as cathode, Ru─Co 2 P effectively reduces furfuraldehyde to furfuryl alcohol and p ‐nitrophenol to p ‐aminophenol. Ru doping enables ease of formation of active species both for reduction and oxidation, faster charge transfer between catalyst to absorbates. Density Functional Theory calculation establishes Ru incorporation in Co 2 P surface results in enhanced adsorption of substrates. Ru doping modulates the electronic structure of Co 2 P which changes the density of states resulting in faster water dissociation and water splitting. To reach 10 mA cm −2 current density only 1.6 V is required for water electrolysis, whereas 1.4 V is enough for substrate‐paired electrolysis with simultaneous oxidation of benzyl alcohol and reduction of p ‐nitro phenol.

Abstract The continuous quest of finding optimum catalysts for photo‐electrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting has been revolving around 2D ultrathin materials because of the fact of exploiting both the surface area. In this work, a threefold impact is envisaged route to enhance the activity both in terms of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the emerging Zirconium Tri‐sulfides (ZrS 3 ) based pseudo‐monolayers. Due to the unique and distinct electronic properties of the tri‐chalcogenide systems as compared to the di‐chalcogenide counterpart of Zirconium, one could afford to explore the implications of not only single‐atom functionalization and vacancy defect, but also the external strain to expedite the bifunctional catalytic activity in this promising material. Rigorous electronic structure calculations have been performed for the mentioned threefold effect on not only the band‐edge alignment, but going beyond to it by further constructing the reaction coordinate mapping corresponding to HER and OER mechanism. The repercussion of external strain in addition to the single atom functionalization and vacancy defect on the adsorption free energies of the prime intermediates of HER and OER reaction has been further correlated with the work function variation in this pseudo‐monolayer system.

Abstract Molecular oxygen redox electrocatalysis involves oxygen reduction and evolution as core reactions in various energy conversion and environmental technology fields. Strong metal‐support interactions (SMSIs) based nanomaterials are regarded as desirable and state‐of‐the‐art heterogeneous electrocatalysts due to their exceptional physicochemical properties. Over the past decades, considerable advancements in theory and experiment have been achieved in related studies, especially in modulating the electronic structure and geometrical configuration of SMSIs to enable activity, selectivity, and stability. In this focuses on the concept of SMSI, explore their various manifestations and mechanisms of action, and summarizes recent advances in SMSIs for efficient energy conversion in oxygen redox electrocatalysis applications. Additionally, the correlation between the physicochemical properties of different metals and supports is systematically elucidated, and the potential mechanisms of the structure–activity relationships between SMSIs and catalytic performance are outlined through theoretical models. Finally, the obstacles confronting this burgeoning field are comprehensively concluded, targeted recommendations and coping strategies are proposed, and future research perspectives are outlined.

Abstract The demand for renewable energy sources has become more urgent due to climate change and environmental pollution. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in green energy sources. This article primarily explores the potential of using non‐noble metals, such as transition and rare earth metals, to enhance the efficiency of the OER process. Due to their cost‐effectiveness and unique electronic structure, these non‐noble metals could be a game‐changer in the field. ′Doping,′ which is the process of adding a small amount of impurity to a material to alter its properties, and ′synergistic effects,′ which refer to the combined effect of two or more elements that is greater than the sum of their individual effects, are two key concepts in this field. Transition and rare earth metals can reduce the overpotential, a measure of the excess potential required to drive a reaction, thus enhancing the OER process by engineering the electronic and surface molecular structure. This article summarizes the roles of various non‐noble metals in the OER process and highlights opportunities for researchers to propose innovative ways to optimize the OER process.

ABSTRACT Beyond addressing technological demands, the integration of machine learning (ML) into human societies has also promoted sustainability through the adoption of digitalized protocols. Despite these advantages and the abundance of available toolkits, a substantial implementation gap is preventing the widespread incorporation of ML protocols into the computational and experimental chemistry communities. In this work, we introduce ROBERT, a software carefully crafted to make ML more accessible to chemists of all programming skill levels, while achieving results comparable to those of field experts. We conducted benchmarking using six recent ML studies in chemistry containing from 18 to 4149 entries. Furthermore, we demonstrated the program's ability to initiate workflows directly from SMILES strings, which simplifies the generation of ML predictors for common chemistry problems. To assess ROBERT's practicality in real‐life scenarios, we employed it to discover new luminescent Pd complexes with a modest dataset of 23 points, a frequently encountered scenario in experimental studies.

Abstract The rational design and fabrication of 2D heterojuctions are proven a promising strategy for boosting the performance of electrocatalysts. Although 2D platinum diselenide (PtSe 2 ) exhibits catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the catalytic performance is still unsatisfactory due to its inert basal plane, wide bandgap, and poor electron transfer ability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to construct PtSe 2 /PtCo heterojunctions by partial selenization of PtCo alloy for high‐efficiency HER electrocatalyst, which exhibits a low overpotential of 38 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm −2 , a small Tafel slope of 22 mV dec −1 , and a superior stability over 24 h and 1000 cycles. The outstanding HER activity of the catalyst arises from the strong electronic interactions between PtSe 2 and PtCo in the heterojunctions, which induce electron transferring from PtSe 2 to PtCo and the d‐band center down shifting, and thus optimize the H * adsorption/desorption. This work provides a novel strategy for constructing highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts, which facilitates the applications of hydrogen energy conversion.

The association between host country language proficiency and disease prevention among migrants is underexplored. The objective of this study is to assess the extent to which self-reported command of the Thai language is associated with adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors (CPB) among Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand. We distributed a self-administered structured questionnaire in Burmese language to 1,050 Myanmar migrant workers in Southern Thailand from September 2022 to January 2023. The questionnaire included background characteristics, self-reported Thai language proficiency based on the Common European Framework Reference (CEFR), and self-reported CPB adherence at residence and workplace. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and multivariate linear regression analysis. Although slightly less than half of the participants reported CEFR A1 level or higher in Thai speaking and listening skills, less than 10 percent did so for reading and writing skills. Workplace COVID-19 preventive adherence scores were initially found to be significantly associated with A1 level or higher speaking and listening skills. However, after adjusting for confounders, these associations were not statistically significant (Speaking skill's Adjusted Beta = 0.713, 95% CI = -0.011, 1.437; Listening skill's Adjusted Beta = -0.367, 95% CI = -1.087, 0.353). No significant associations were found between any language skill domain and residence COVID-19 preventive adherence scores for both unadjusted and adjusted analysis. The study findings may have implications for relevant stakeholders in migrant services, migrant health, and infectious disease control. However, information biases, language barriers, and lack of generalizability should be considered as caveats in the interpretation of the study findings.
