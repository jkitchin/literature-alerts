We present BEAST DB, an open-source database comprised of ab initio electrochemical data computed using grand-canonical density functional theory in implicit solvent at consistent calculation parameters. The database contains over 20,000 surface calculations and covers a broad set of heterogeneous catalyst materials and electrochemical reactions. Calculations were performed at self-consistent fixed potential as well as constant charge to facilitate comparisons to the computational hydrogen electrode. This article presents common use cases of the database to rationalize trends in catalyst activity, screen catalyst material spaces, understand elementary mechanistic steps, analyze the electronic structure, and train machine learning models to predict higher fidelity properties. Users can interact graphically with the database by querying for individual calculations to gain a granular understanding of reaction steps or by querying for an entire reaction pathway on a given material using an interactive reaction pathway tool. BEAST DB will be periodically updated, with planned future updates to include advanced electronic structure data, surface speciation studies, and greater reaction coverage.    

    

## Mechanism of the Layered-to-Spinel Phase Transformation in Li0.5NiO2

The phase transition of layered Li0.5NiO2 to spinel Li(NiO2)2 is a potential degradation pathway in LiNiO2-based lithium-ion battery cathodes. We investigated the mechanism of this phase transformation from first principles. Consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature, our results indicate a high energy barrier for the transformation due to high defect formation energies, a complex charge-transfer mechanism, and electronic frustration. Our results suggest that partially inverse spinel phases are unlikely to form for Li0.5NiO2, a qualitative difference from the chemically similar Li0.5MnO2, in which the transformation occurs at room temperature. We show that Ni and Li atoms do not migrate gradually to their respective spinel sites for the layered-to-spinel transformation to occur due to high defect formation energies. We investigated the charge ordering in layered phases along the LiNiO2–NiO2 composition line, finding a pronounced impact of the symmetry and space group on the layered-to-spinel transition in Li0.5NiO2. Finally, we evaluated the relative stability of different spinel space groups, finding that previously reported experimental observations are consistent with a temperature-averaged structure rather than the 0 K ground-state structure of the Li(NiO2)2 spinel.

Electrocatalysis is key to realizing a sustainable future for our society. However, the complex interface between electrocatalysts and electrolytes presents an ongoing challenge in electrocatalysis, hindering the accurate identification of effective/authentic structure-activity relationships and determination of favourable reaction mechanisms. Surface coverage and reconstruction analyses of electrocatalysts are important to address each conjecture and/or conflicting viewpoint on surface-active phases and their corresponding electrocatalytic origin,

The assembly of molecules to form covalent networks can create varied lattice structures with physical and chemical properties distinct from those of conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C24 networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesized monolayer polymeric C60. Monolayer C24 harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps, and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C24 are comparable to those of TiO2, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C24 and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface-active sites of C24 monolayers are three times more than that of their C60 counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion, and storage.

Abstract The synthesis of hydrogen via water electrolysis is an important step towards resolving the energy crisis and impeding global warming, as hydrogen can be used as a green energy carrier. The oxygen evolution as one half‐cell reaction (OER) is currently limiting efficient water splitting due to kinetic inhibition as well as a complex mechanism, causing a large overpotential. Nickel‐iron layered double hydroxides (LDH) were found to be suitable OER catalysts, as they are cost effective, stable and highly active. This work focuses on the intercalation of different organic and inorganic borates into the LDH interlayers to study their influence on OER. Besides activity and stability measurements, three borate candidates were chosen for a kinetic study, including steady‐state Tafel analysis and reaction order plots. It was found that the Bockris pathway with the second step as rate‐determining step was predominant for all three catalysts. Of all candidates, the intercalation of borate resulted in the highest performance, which was associated with a high reducibility affecting the active metal sites.

Abstract Insufficient bifunctional activity of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major obstruction to the application of rechargeable metal–air batteries. The primary reason is the mutual constraint of ORR and OER mechanism, involving the same oxygen‐containing intermediates and demonstrating the scaling limitations of the adsorption energies. Herein, it is reported a high‐valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide (Ir SA ‐MnO x ) bifunctional catalyst showing independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e − pathway on high‐valence Ir site for ORR and a novel chemical‐activated concerted mechanism for OER, where a distinct spontaneous chemical activation process triggers direct O ─ O coupling. The Ir SA ‐MnO x therefore delivers outstanding bifunctional activities with remarkably low potential difference (0.635 V) between OER potential at 10 mA cm −2 and ORR half‐wave potential in alkaline solution. This work breaks the scaling limitations and provides a new avenue to design efficient and multifunctional electrocatalysts.

Abstract Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) can effectively convert the hydrogen energy through the hydrogen fuel cells, which plays an increasingly important role in the renewable hydrogen cycle. Nevertheless, when the electrolyte pH changes from acid to base, even with platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts, the HOR kinetics declines with several orders of magnitude. More critically, the pivotal role of reaction intermediates and interfacial environment during intermediate behaviors on alkaline HOR remains controversial. Therefore, exploring the exceptional PGM‐based alkaline HOR electrocatalysts and identifying the reaction mechanism are indispensable for promoting the commercial development of hydrogen fuel cells. Consequently, the fundamental understanding of the HOR mechanism is first introduced, with emphases on the adsorption/desorption process of distinct reactive intermediates and the interfacial structure during catalytic process. Subsequently, with the guidance of reaction mechanism, the latest advances in the rational design of advanced PGM‐based (Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, Rh‐based) alkaline HOR catalysts are discussed, focusing on the correlation between the intermediate behaviors and the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, given that the challenges standing in the development of the alkaline HOR, the prospect for the rational catalysts design and thorough mechanism investigation towards alkaline HOR are emphatically proposed.

The distribution of Al on a zeolite framework can have a determining influence on chemical and catalytic properties. Those distributions are typically determined during synthesis as influenced by cationic organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). Here we use density functional theory (DFT) to compare the Al directing influence of N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantyl ammonium (TMAda+), an OSDA commonly used to crystallize CHA zeolite, with four isomers that retain the adamantyl structure but relocate the nitrogen center. Low energy configurations balance electrostatics-driven maximization of Al–Al and minimization of Al–N separations, the latter more important in OSDAs with more accessible charge centers. Statistical thermodynamics are used to predict thermal equilibrium Al distributions and corresponding Al pair features as a function of OSDA. All distributions differ from those predicted through naive application of Löwenstein's rule, disfavor the placement of two Al second-nearest-neighbor or within a single six-ring, and introduce different biases toward eight-membered rings and more remote Al. Results illustrate the potential to influence Al location through OSDA selection.

Electron transporting (n-type) polymeric mixed conductors are an exciting class of materials for devices with aqueous electrolyte interfaces, such as bioelectronic sensors, actuators, and soft charge storage systems. However, their charge transport performance falls short of their p-type counterparts, primarily due to electrochemical side reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To mitigate ORR, a common strategy in n-type organic semiconductor design focuses on lowering the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level. Despite empirical observations suggesting a correlation between deep LUMO levels, low ORR, and enhanced electrochemical cycling stability in water, this relationship lacks robust evidence. In this work, we delve into the electrochemical reactions of n-type polymeric mixed conductors with varying LUMO levels and assess the impact of ORR on charge storage performance and organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) operation. Our results reveal a limited correlation between LUMO levels and ORR currents, as well as the electrochemical operational stability of the films. While ORR currents minimally contribute to OECT channel currents under fixed biasing conditions, n-type films self-discharge rapidly at floating potentials in a capacitor-like configuration. The density functional theory analysis, complemented by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, underscores the critical role of backbone chemistry in controlling O2-related degradation pathways and device performance losses. These findings highlight the persistent challenge posed by ORR in n-type semiconductor design and advocate for shifting the focus toward exploring chemical moieties with limited O2 interactions to enhance operational stability and performance at n-type film/water interfaces.

The development of multifunctional electrocatalysts with high performance for electrocatalyzing urea oxidation-assisted water splitting is of great significance for energy-saving hydrogen production. In this work, we demonstrate a novel heteroatom engineering strategy for development of B-doped Co as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that a B dopant can efficiently adjust the electron reconstruction of the exposure of Co sites nearby and facilitate electron transfer, resulting in an optimal d-band center along with a lower Gibbs free energy barrier. Ultimately, the obtained B–Co exhibits pH-universal HER properties in various electrolytes. A highly efficient HER performance with overpotentials as low as 27, 163, and 430 mV to −10, −100, and −500 mA cm–2 in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, is observed for the B–Co electrode. More importantly, the UOR-assisted electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 1.55 V to produce the current densities of 50 mA cm–2, resulting in a 200 mV saving-energy potential compared to water electrolysis, demonstrating its high efficiency of hydrogen production in industrial applications.

The ability to lubricate and resist wear at temperatures above 600 °C in an oxidative environment remains a significant challenge for metals due to their high-temperature softening, oxidation, and rapid degradation of traditional solid lubricants. Herein, we demonstrate that high-temperature lubricity can be achieved with coefficients of friction (COF) as low as 0.10-0.32 at 600-900 °C by tailoring surface oxidation in additively-manufactured Inconel superalloy. By integrating high-temperature tribological testing, advanced materials characterization, and computations, we show that the formation of spinel-based oxide layers on superalloy promotes sustained self-lubrication due to their lower shear strength and more negative formation and cohesive energy compared to other surface oxides. A reversible phase transformation between the cubic and tetragonal/monoclinic spinel was driven by stress and temperature during high temperature wear. To span Ni- and Cr-based ternary oxide compositional spaces for which little high-temperature COF data exist, we develop a computational design method to predict the lubricity of oxides, incorporating thermodynamics and density functional theory computations. Our finding demonstrates that spinel oxide can exhibit low COF values at temperatures much higher than conventional solid lubricants with 2D layered or Magnéli structures, suggesting a promising design strategy for self-lubricating high-temperature alloys. The authors develop an approach for enhancing the wear resistance and lubricity of metals at elevated temperatures of in oxidative environments, where traditional solid lubricants fail. By engineering surface oxidation in additively manufactured Inconel, they achieve low friction coefficients, between 0.10 and 0.32 at 600-900 °C, through the formation of a spinel-based oxide layer.

Recently, dual-metal catalysts have attracted much attention due to their abundant active sites and tunable chemical properties. On the other hand, metal borides have been widely applied in splitting the inert chemical bonds in small molecules (such as N2) because of their excellent catalytic performances. As a combination of the above two systems, in this work, 11 kinds of transition metal atoms (TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, and W) were selected to embed in boron-doped graphene (BG) to construct 66 dual-metal–boron systems, and their performances toward the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) were examined using first-principles simulations. Our results revealed that such a dual-TM@BG system exhibits excellent thermodynamic and electrochemical stabilities, which facilitate the experimental synthesis. In particular, Fe–Fe- and Fe–Co-doped BG exhibit excellent performance for NRR, with the limiting potentials of −0.29 and −0.32 V, respectively, and both of them exhibit inhibitory effects on the H2 evolution reaction. Remarkably, the microkinetic modeling analysis revealed that the turnover frequency for the NH3 production on FeFe@BG reaches up to 7.27 × 108 s–1 site–1 at 700 K and 100 bar, which further confirms its ultrafast reaction rate. In addition, the machine learning method was employed to further understand the catalytic mechanism, and it is found that the NRR performances of dual-TM@BG catalysts are closely related to the sum of radii of two TM atoms. Therefore, our work not only proposed two promising electrocatalysts for NRR but also verified the feasibility for the application of a dual-metal–boron system in NRR.

The present study explores the contributory benefits of PtPd catalyst nanoparticles supported on a mixed valence iron oxide (Fe3O4) and polypyrrole (PPy) composite for validation in both the ethanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium for low temperature direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs). The high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for PtPd/PPy-Fe3O4 with smart intervention of Fe3O4 directly/indirectly in the EOR and ORR sequences makes this distinct catalyst a highly preferred choice in direct ethanol fuel cells with respect to reduced polarization loss, substantial current density output, and greater stability compared to the usual Pt or Pd single nanocatalysts supported over carbon, while the conducting polymer present in the composite matrix enhances the charge transfer ability within the direct ethanol fuel cell framework. The catalyst nanoparticles are found to be in the size range 4–5 nm, as revealed from structure and morphology studies. Ion chromatographic analysis quantifies the reaction intermediates, acetate and carbonate, to the extent of 366 and 251 ppm using 1 M ethanol solution, while a low yield of H2O2 is a testament to the major utility of the combinatorial approach in the ORR. The studies involved morphology determined through electron microscopy and electrochemical characterization with the help of potentiodynamic polarization and RDE-RRDE techniques. The catalytic preeminence of the nanostructured PtPd/PPy-Fe3O4 was manifested by the facile electrode kinetics at the anode and cathode, the low yield of H2O2 in the ORR, and the appreciable power density output of 47.65 mW/cm2 of the complete cell bearing enormous mass activity for both the EOR and ORR. This novel attempt of introducing the single robust catalyst at both ends ensures better catalyst utilization, imparts affordability, and avoids carbon corrosion in the fuel cell environment.

It remains a grand challenge to develop electrocatalysts with simultaneously high activity, long durability, and low cost for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), originating from two competing reaction pathways and often trade-off performances. The adsorbed evolution mechanism (AEM) suffers from sluggish kinetics due to a linear scaling relationship, while the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) causes unstable structures due to lattice oxygen escape. We propose a MoZnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) incorporating AEM-promoter Mo and LOM-active Zn to achieve dual activation and stabilization for efficient and durable OER. Density functional theory and chemical probe experiments confirmed dual-mechanism activation, with representative Co-Co † -Mo sites facilitating AEM and Zn-O † -Ni sites enhancing LOM, resulting in an ultralow OER overpotential (η 10 = 221 mV). The multielement interaction, high-entropy structure, and carbon network notably enhance structural stability for durable catalysis (>1500 hours at 100 mA cm −2 ). Our work offers a viable approach to concurrently enhance OER activity and stability by designing HEA catalysts to enable dual-mechanism synergy.

The metal-support interaction is one of the most important pillars in heterogeneous catalysis, but developing a fundamental theory has been challenging because of the intricate interfaces. Based on experimental ‎data, interpretable machine learning, theoretical derivation, and first-principles simulations, we established a ‎general theory of metal-oxide interactions grounded in ‎metal-metal and metal-oxygen interactions. The theory applies to metal nanoparticles and atoms on oxide supports and oxide films on metal supports. We found that for late-transition metal catalysts, metal-metal interactions dominated the oxide support effects and suboxide encapsulation over metal nanoparticles. A principle of strong metal-metal interactions for encapsulation occurrence is formulated and substantiated by extensive ‎experiments including 10 metals and 16 ‎oxides. The valuable insights revealed on (strong) metal-support interaction advance the interfacial design of supported metal catalysts.

The development of high-performance non-Ir/Ru catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid is critical for the applications of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a new kind of heterostructure catalyst by loading 5.8% Ag nanoparticles on MnO nanorods (Ag/MnO) for acidic OER. The as-prepared Ag/MnO requires only an overpotential of 196 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and operates in a PEMWE for over 300 h at a current density of 200 mA cm–2, representing one of the best non-Ir/Ru OER catalysts. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms that the introduction of trace Ag can promote the generation of highly active Mn3+–O sites with oxygen vacancies at a low voltage, leading to a dual-metal-site lattice oxygen-mediated pathway with faster kinetics than the adsorbate evolution mechanism. Theoretical calculations indicate that the trace Ag promotes the overlap between the d orbitals of Mn and the s, p orbitals of O, thereby activating the lattice oxygen and reducing the OER energy barrier. The dissolution of Mn is also suppressed by Ag due to the increased energy for vacancy formation of Mn, where the stability number reaches a high value of 3058, supporting improved structural stability.

Exploiting highly effective electrocatalysts is a challenge for boosting the overall efficiency of water splitting. Herein, we present a nitrogen and ruthenium dual-doping strategy to tailor the electronic structures of NiCoP(N, Ru–NiCoP), creating high-performance bifunctional electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The dual-doping approach is favorable for electronic interactions within the NiCoP and CoP, yielding a near-zero Gibbs free energy for H adsorption. Consequently, the optimized N, Ru–NiCoP electrodes exhibit exceptional bifunctional activities, with overpotentials of 53 and 405 mV at 100 mA cm–2 for the HER and OER, respectively. Notably, their performance surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts at large current densities, demonstrating their potential for industrial water splitting applications. Moreover, the overall water-splitting device achieves a current density of 10 mA cm–2 with a driving voltage of only 1.54 V. This work provides an effective heteroatom doping strategy to develop low-cost and highly active electrocatalysts.

The field of data-driven chemistry is undergoing an evolution, driven by innovations in machine learning models for predicting molecular properties and behavior. Recent strides in ML-based interatomic potentials have paved the way for accurate modeling of diverse chemical and structural properties at the atomic level. The key determinant defining MLIP reliability remains the quality of the training data. A paramount challenge lies in constructing training sets that capture specific domains in the vast chemical and structural space. This Review navigates the intricate landscape of essential components and integrity of training data that ensure the extensibility and transferability of the resulting models. We delve into the details of active learning, discussing its various facets and implementations. We outline different types of uncertainty quantification applied to atomistic data acquisition and the correlations between estimated uncertainty and true error. The role of atomistic data samplers in generating diverse and informative structures is highlighted. Furthermore, we discuss data acquisition via modified and surrogate potential energy surfaces as an innovative approach to diversify training data. The Review also provides a list of publicly available data sets that cover essential domains of chemical space.

Abstract Ir‐Ru alloys with high Ru content serve as stable and highly active catalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers (PEM‐WEs), enabling efficient operation with low Ir loadings (150 µg cm − 2 ). Despite this, the mechanisms behind their enhanced stability remain unclear. In this study, operando Wide‐Angle X‐ray Scattering (WAXS) and ex situ techniques are utilized to investigate the structural evolution of these magnetron‐sputtered alloys during a PEM‐WE operation. The findings reveal that Ru leaches from the surface upon potential application, forming a dynamic Ir‐Ru@IrO x core‐shell structure. The Ir shell, strained by the Ir‐Ru core, maintains a lower oxidation state than pure Ir catalyst, leading to superior catalytic activity and stability. Remarkably, the Ir‐Ru 25:75 catalyst demonstrates better stability over Ir‐Ru 50:50, despite its higher Ru content, due to the better protection of the subsurface Ir and Ru from oxidation and dissolution. This study not only clarifies the performance‐enhancing mechanisms of Ir‐Ru catalysts but also suggests that other, more economical materials, such as Co or Ti, could serve as effective cores in Ir‐M systems, offering a pathway to more cost‐effective catalysts for PEM‐WE applications.

Abstract Perovskite‐type oxides are widely employed as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts due to their tunable composition, diverse structure, abundant natural reserves, remarkable stability, and low cost. The intrinsic OER electrocatalytic activity of these perovskite oxides is generally enhanced by improving conductivity, increasing specific surface area, and optimizing the adsorption of oxygen‐containing intermediates. This is achieved through rationally designed strategies, including compositional engineering, defect engineering, hybridization, and surface regulation. In this review, recent advances in perovskite oxides for OER are summarized, with a focus on exploring structure‐performance relationships. This review provides a brief introduction to the application of perovskite oxides in OER, followed by the classification and characteristics of these perovskite oxides. The primary OER catalytic mechanisms, and well‐established activity descriptors are discussed. The key strategies are concentrated for enhancing OER activity, including composition engineering, defect engineering, hybridization, and surface reconstruction. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in developing high‐performance perovskite oxides as OER electrocatalysts are presented.

Enhancing the selectivity of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to valuable multicarbon (C2+) products remains a significant challenge in green synthetic chemistry. Here, we present a dual-center strategy for metal oxides that boosts the photochemical conversion of CO2 to ethanol by regulating the coordination number of metal and oxygen sites. Notably, CuO catalysts rich in low-coordinated Cu–O domains have achieved nearly perfect ethanol selectivity (96.9%), extraordinary durability (60 h), and a superior yield rate of 30.5 μmol·g–1·h–1, surpassing the performance of many existing photocatalysts in water vapor and CO2. Density functional theory calculations and operando spectroscopic results provide conclusive evidence that tricoordinated copper (Cu3c) increases the coverage of key *CO species, while bicoordinated oxygen (O2c) controls the migration of *CO species, thereby effectively reducing the energy requirement for *CO dimerization into *OC–CO intermediates (ΔG*OC–CO = −0.56 eV) in the ethanol pathway. This work offers valuable insights for designing photocatalysts that exhibit improved selectivity for C2+ fuels.

Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) is of great importance for the production of green hydrogen. The large‐scale implementation of PEMWE, however, is seriously impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which results in considerable overpotential and thus the decreased energy conversion efficiency. To overcome this problem, researchers have extensively explored efficient anode catalysts that possess high activity and prolonged stability. Up to now, Ir‐based and Ru‐based catalysts are considered to be the most efficient candidates. Especially perovskite‐based catalysts have received intensive attention due to their distinctive structures and exceptional OER catalytic performance. To further promote their practical application, considerable research efforts are devoted to structural engineering toward enhanced activity and stability. In this paper, a review of the research progress on the advanced design of Ir‐ and Ru‐based perovskite catalysts is presented, with a focus on phase engineering, doping/substitution, morphology control, and compositing with other materials for perovskite catalysts as well as some preparation methods commonly used. It also summarizes the challenges and opportunities concerning perovskite‐based catalysts in current research, yielding further comprehension of the pertinent preparation and scrutiny of perovskite catalysts in the future.

Elucidating the electronic factors dominating the adsorption properties of transition-metal oxides is essential to construct highly efficient oxygen-evolving catalysts for hydrogen production by water splitting but remains a great challenge. Electron correlation from on-site Coulomb repulsion (U) among d-electrons is generally believed to significantly affect the electronic structure of these materials; however, it has long been neglected in studying their adsorption properties. Here, by choosing ruthenium oxide as a model system, we demonstrate the role of electron correlation on the electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our density functional theory plus U calculations on rutile RuO2 reveal that the electron correlation can tune the adsorption energies for oxygenated intermediate and optimize them after the metallic oxide being a Mott insulator upon increasing U. By regulating the RuO6 octahedral network, we constructed and synthesized a series of strongly correlated ruthenium oxides, where the Mott insulating ones indeed exhibit a superior OER performance to the metallic RuO2. Our work builds a bridge between the electrochemistry and Mott physics for transition-metal oxides, opening a new avenue for designing advanced catalysts.

For solid waste management and sustainable development, the conversion of waste materials into valuable feedstocks is essential. Keeping in mind the concept of "waste-to-wealth," we have synthesized value-added microporous graphitic carbon from waste Tecoma leaves, referred to as TA, through a one-step chemical activation process and utilized it for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) and capacitive energy storage applications. The transformation of biomass into metal-free porous graphitic carbon having an ORR efficiency comparable to or even better than commercially available Pt/C is critical for renewable energy conversion technologies. The TA-900 sample, synthesized at 900 °C having a high surface area of 1429 m2 g–1, containing 4.41 atom % nitrogen and 4.74 atom % oxygen, demonstrated excellent ORR performance among the synthesized graphitic carbon samples at different temperatures. It showed an onset potential (Eonset) of 1 V and a limiting current density (JL) of 6.21 mA cm–2, comparable to 10 wt % Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the TA-900 electrocatalyst exhibited a 4e– transfer mechanism in the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O. Regarding supercapacitor application, TA-900 achieved a high specific capacitance of 546 F g–1 in acidic and 327 F g–1 in neutral aqueous electrolyte at a current density of 1 A g–1 in a three-electrode setup. The TA-900-based symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC) device has remarkable durability, retaining its 84% capacitance retention even after 3000 cycles at 1 A g–1. It also achieved a notable energy density (33 Wh kg–1 and 6.60 mWh cm–3) and a power density (6.20 kW kg–1 and 1320 mW cm–3). The findings emphasize that heteroatom-doped TA-900 electrocatalysts synthesized from waste Tecoma leaves will be a promising, affordable alternative to the high-cost Pt/C catalyst used for clean energy conversion.

Discovery of novel and promising materials is a critical challenge in the field of chemistry and material science, traditionally approached through methodologies ranging from trial-and-error to machine-learning-driven inverse design. Recent studies suggest that transformer-based language models can be utilized as material generative models to expand the chemical space and explore materials with desired properties. In this work, we introduce the catalyst generative pretrained transformer (CatGPT), trained to generate string representations of inorganic catalyst structures from a vast chemical space. CatGPT not only demonstrates high performance in generating valid and accurate catalyst structures but also serves as a foundation model for generating the desired types of catalysts by text-conditioning and fine-tuning. As an example, we fine-tuned the pretrained CatGPT using a binary alloy catalyst data set designed for screening two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) catalyst and generated catalyst structures specialized for 2e-ORR. Our work demonstrates the potential of generative language models as generative tools for catalyst discovery.

D-amino acids, found in excess in a minority of organisms and crucial for marine invertebrates, contrast with the more common L-amino acids in most life forms. The local prebiotic origin of D-amino acid enantiomeric excess in natural systems remains an unsolved conundrum. Herein, we demonstrate the formation of enantiomeric excess (ee) D-amino acids through photocatalytic reductive amination of α-keto acids on natural pyrite. Various amino acids with ee values in the range of 14.5–42.4%, are formed. The wavy arrangement of atoms on the surface of pyrite is speculated to lead to the preferential formation of D-amino acids. This work reveals the intrinsic asymmetric photocatalytic activity of pyrite, which could expand understandings on mechanism of asymmetric catalysis and chirality of inorganic crystals. Furthermore, it provides a plausible pathway for the prebiotic formation of D-amino acids, adding further evidence to the origin of D-amino acids enantiomeric excess in natural systems. Enantiomeric excess D-amino acids form via photocatalytic reductive amination of α-keto acids on natural pyrite. This provides a plausible pathway for the prebiotic formation of D-amino acids.

Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to the valuable ammonia is a green and sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber-Bosch method for ammonia synthesis, while the activity and selectivity for ammonia production remains poor at low nitrite concentrations. Herein, we report a nanoporous intermetallic single-atom alloy CuZn (np/ISAA-CuZn) catalyst with completely isolated Cu-Zn active-sites, which achieves neutral nitrite reduction reaction with a remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency over 95% and the highest energy efficiency of ≈ 59.1% in wide potential range from −0.2 to −0.8 V vs. RHE. The np/ISAA-CuZn electrocatalyst was able to operate stably at 500 mA cm−2 for 220 h under membrane electrode assembly conditions with a stabilized NH3 Faraday efficiency of ~80% and high NO2‒ removal rate of ~100%. A series of in situ experimental studies combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that strong electronic interactions of isolated Cu-Zn active-sites altered the protonation adsorption species, effectively alleviating the protonation barrier of *NO2 and thus greatly facilitating the selective reduction of NO2− into NH3. Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction is a green alternative to the Haber-Bosch process, but its ammonia production remains inefficient at low nitrite levels. Here the authors report an intermetallic single atom alloy CuZn catalyst for nitrite reduction to ammonia with high efficiency and stability at low nitrite concentration of 1−10 mM.
