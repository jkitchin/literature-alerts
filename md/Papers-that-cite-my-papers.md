Abstract The convergence of water electrolysis and alkaline fuel cells offers captivating solutions for sustainably harvesting energy. The research explores both hydrazine‐assisted seawater electrolysis (hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen production reaction (HER)), as well as alkaline hydrazine fuel cell reactions (HzOR and Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)) by using a bifunctional cobalt polyaniline derived (Co PANI/C) catalyst. The catalyst shows excellent performance for hydrazine‐assisted seawater electrolysis in harsh seawater environments to produce H 2 as fuel with nearly 85% Faradaic efficiency and during alkaline HzOR, the bifunctional catalyst generates H 2 with 95% Faradaic efficiency by acting as both anode and cathode side catalyst. Also, the same catalyst requires only a potential of 0.34 V versus RHE and 0.906 V versus RHE for HzOR and ORR, respectively, in 1 m KOH, which makes this overall process useful for a Hz/O 2 fuel cell.

The particle residence time distribution (RTD) and axial dispersion coefficient are key parameters for the design and operation of a pressurized circulating fluidized bed (PCFB). In this study, the effects of pressure (0.1–0.6 MPa), fluidizing gas velocity (2–7 m·s–1) and solid circulation rate (10–90 kg·m–2·s–1) on particle RTD and axial dispersion coefficient in a PCFB are numerically investigated based on the multiphase particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) method. The details of gas–solid flow behaviors of PCFB are revealed. Based on the gas–solid flow pattern, the particles tend to move more orderly under elevated pressures. With an increase in either fluidizing gas velocity or solid circulation rate, the mean residence time of particles decreases while the axial dispersion coefficient increases. With an increase in pressure, the core-annulus flow is strengthened, which leads to a wider shape of the particle RTD curve and a larger mean particle residence time. The back-mixing of particles increases with increasing pressure, resulting in an increase in the axial dispersion coefficient.

This study employs first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations to investigate the stability, electronic properties, and oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) activity of $M$ adatoms ($M=\text{Fe},\text{Co}$) on free-standing bilayer borophene (BB) with different coverages. Our findings indicate that metals strongly bind to the BB surface, particularly at the hollow sites, inducing metallicity. We analyze the dissociation energy of ${\text{O}}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{OOH}$ after the adsorption on the metal center of BBM while ORR activity was assessed through the free-energy adsorption of their intermediates. The stability of the systems at electrochemical conditions was investigated by Pourbaix analysis as well as by AIMD simulations, which include explicit solvents. Our results suggest that $\mathrm{BBCo}$ in a low-coverage adatom configuration would exhibit competitive ORR activity, with a theoretical overpotential of around 1 V. However, this activity would only be feasible in alkaline environments where the stability $\mathrm{BBCo}$ is preserved. Hubbard-$U$ corrections and the hybrid functional approaches within DFT are taken into consideration, and subsequent results are compared.

Transition metal hydr(oxy)oxides (TMHs) are considered efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Toward identification of potential descriptors to circumvent the scaling relation limit for the OER, first-principles calculations were used to quantify the effects on the overpotential of different s (Mg), p (Al), and d (Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Sc, and Zn) electron dopants in Ni-based TMHs. Both the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) were examined. The results demonstrate that the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (EVO) is strongly affected by the chemical nature of the dopants. A linear relationship is identified between EVO and the free energy difference for the oxygen–oxygen coupling. A descriptor could be employed to discriminate whether the LOM is energetically favored over the AEM. These findings fill existing gaps in appropriate yet computationally light descriptors for direct identification between the AEM and LOM.

Metal-organic framework (MOF) has been widely applied in photocatalysis, which is significant for addressing energy crises and environmental issues. Based on density functional theory calculations, the performances of Cu-BTC, a copper-based MOF, and its derivatives CuTM-BTC via the substitution of transition metal (TM) elements at the Cu site for photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS) have been studied. POWS of Cu-BTC suffers from the sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction due to the large overpotential of 2.02 V and limited solar utilization due to a wide HOMO-LUMO gap of 4.11 eV. Via TM substitution, the HOMO-LUMO gap narrows but still satisfies the redox potentials when taken 3d-TM of Cr, Fe, Co or Ni, 4d-TM of Rh or Pd, or 5d-TM of Re or Pt into consideration, benefiting for the light absorption. Furthermore, Cr and Re could serve as active sites for hydrogen evolution with remarkably lowered overpotentials of 0.79 V and 0.28 V, respectively; similarly, oxygen evolution activities could be enhanced by Fe, Co and Rh because of their reduced overpotentials which are less than 0.5 V. Therefore, our findings pave guidance for designing Cu-BTC derivatives in overall water splitting.

The last decade has witnessed the emergence of the application of piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials for catalytic and photocatalytic applications that harness light, thermal and mechanical energy into chemical reactions. This article surveys the different concepts of pyro- and piezocatalysis and differences with respect to ferrocatalysis and switchable catalysis and delves into the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying piezocatalysis. The outlook for advancing in the surface science studies required for the design of new and better catalysts based on polar electromechanically active materials is discussed in the context of the state of the art experimental studies and potential future nanoscience developments.

Controlling the magnetic state of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for spintronics. By employing data-mining and autonomous density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate the switching of magnetic properties of 2D non-van der Waals materials upon hydrogen passivation. The magnetic configurations are tuned to states with flipped and enhanced moments. For 2D CdTiO3─a diamagnetic compound in the pristine case─we observe an onset of ferromagnetism upon hydrogenation. Further investigation of the magnetization density of the pristine and passivated systems provides a detailed analysis of modified local spin symmetries and the emergence of ferromagnetism. Our results indicate that selective surface passivation is a powerful tool for tailoring magnetic properties of nanomaterials, such as non-vdW 2D compounds.

Herein, two Laves intermetallic series, ZrCo1.75M0.25 and NbCo1.75M0.25 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt), were synthesized, and their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities were examined to reveal the influence of d electrons to the corresponding HER activities. Owing to the different electronegativity between Zr and Nb (χZr = 1.33; χNb = 1.60), Co and/or M elements receive more electrons in ZrCo1.75M0.25 than that of the Nb one. This leads to the overall weak H adsorption energy (ΔGHad) of ZrCo1.75M0.25 series compared to that of NbCo1.75M0.25 and rationalizes well the superior HER activity of the Rh member compared to that of the Pt one in the ZrCo1.75M0.25 series. Under industrial conditions (333 K, 6.0 M KOH), ZrCo1.75Rh0.25 only requires an overpotential of 110 mV to reach the current density of 500 mA/cm2 and can be operated at high current density over 400 h. This work demonstrates that with a proper combination between elements in intermetallic phases, one can manipulate d electrons of the active metal to be closer to the sweet spot (ΔGHad = 0). The Pt member may no longer exhibit the best HER activity in series, and all elements exhibit the potential to outperform the Pt member in the HER with careful control of the d electron population.

Zinc-bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) are considered as one of the most promising energy storage technologies, owing to the high energy density and low cost. However, the sluggish electrochemical kinetics and severe self-discharge lead to the limited power density and service life, hindering the practical application of ZBFBs. Herein, Prussian blue modified nitrogen-doped carbon (PB@NC) is synthesized as an auxiliary redox-targeting catalyst for the bromine cathode. The excellent conductivity and adsorption capability of nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) ensure the smooth electron transfer and the enriched bromine species at the reaction interface. Under the assistance of NC, Prussian blue (PB) could rapidly lose or gain electrons, then transform into the oxidized or reduced states that subsequently engages in the targeted redox reactions with the contacted Br‐ or Br2. It offers an alternative reaction pathway for the bromine redox, promoting the electrochemical kinetics significantly, which demonstrates a reversible redox-targeting catalytic effect. Therefore, a ZBFB modified with PB@NC achieves an energy efficiency of 85.9% at a current density of 80 mA cm−2, and ultra-high energy efficiency of 71.1% even at current density of 160 mA cm−2. This work offers a promising strategy for advancing the development of ZBFBs by the efficient cathode material design.

Reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of metal electrodes under an applied voltage in an explicit water environment were performed and compared to predictions from both other calculations and simulations and experimental measurements and observations. MD simulations using the third-generation charge-optimized many body (COMB3) potentials and the electrode COMB (eCOMB) approach allow for the simulation of an externally applied voltage by modifying the equations of motion during the charge equilibration step (QEq) of the MD simulation. Unlike previous work, which prevented charge transfer between the water and metal electrodes, this work coupled the water and metal together through the QEq, which leads to an accumulation of a negative charge on the water and a positive charge on the metal before any voltage is applied. The extent of this charge accumulation is characterized, and strategies to mitigate it are explored. Root mean square deviation plots of the metal surfaces are created for each simulation to compare the extent of oxidation and dissolution. Good agreement is found between the oxidation behavior of the simulated metal surfaces and the experimental observations.

We review the GPAW open-source Python package for electronic structure calculations. GPAW is based on the projector-augmented wave method and can solve the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) equations using three different wave-function representations, namely real-space grids, plane waves, and numerical atomic orbitals. The three representations are complementary and mutually independent and can be connected by transformations via the real-space grid. This multi-basis feature renders GPAW highly versatile and unique among similar codes. By virtue of its modular structure, the GPAW code constitutes an ideal platform for the implementation of new features and methodologies. Moreover, it is well integrated with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), providing a flexible and dynamic user interface. In addition to ground-state DFT calculations, GPAW supports many-body GW band structures, optical excitations from the Bethe–Salpeter Equation, variational calculations of excited states in molecules and solids via direct optimization, and real-time propagation of the Kohn–Sham equations within time-dependent DFT. A range of more advanced methods to describe magnetic excitations and non-collinear magnetism in solids are also now available. In addition, GPAW can calculate non-linear optical tensors of solids, charged crystal point defects, and much more. Recently, support for graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration has been achieved with minor modifications to the GPAW code thanks to the CuPy library. We end the review with an outlook, describing some future plans for GPAW.

Abstract Atomistic simulation has a broad range of applications from drug design to materials discovery. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become an efficient alternative to computationally expensive ab initio simulations. For this reason, chemistry and materials science would greatly benefit from a general reactive MLIP, that is, an MLIP that is applicable to a broad range of reactive chemistry without the need for refitting. Here we develop a general reactive MLIP (ANI-1xnr) through automated sampling of condensed-phase reactions. ANI-1xnr is then applied to study five distinct systems: carbon solid-phase nucleation, graphene ring formation from acetylene, biofuel additives, combustion of methane and the spontaneous formation of glycine from early earth small molecules. In all studies, ANI-1xnr closely matches experiment (when available) and/or previous studies using traditional model chemistry methods. As such, ANI-1xnr proves to be a highly general reactive MLIP for C, H, N and O elements in the condensed phase, enabling high-throughput in silico reactive chemistry experimentation.

Despite substantial efforts in developing high-performance catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the persistent challenge lies in the high onset overpotential of the ORR, and the effect of the electrolyte solution cannot be ignored. Consequently, we have systematically investigated the impact of adsorbate species and concentration, as well as solution pH, on the ORR activity on Pt(111) and Pt(poly) electrodes. The results all tend to establish a linear quantitative relationship between the onset potential for ORR and the adsorption equilibrium potential of the adsorbate. This finding indicates the decisive role of adsorbates in the onset potential for ORR, suggesting that the adsorption potential of adsorbates can serve as an intuitive criterion for ORR activity. Additional support for this conclusion is derived from experimental results obtained from the oxygen evolution reaction on Pt(poly) with different adsorbate species and from the hydrogen evolution reaction on Pt(111) with iodine adsorption. We further propose both an empirical equation for the onset potential for ORR and the concept of a potential-regulated adsorbate shielding effect to elucidate the influence of adsorbates on ORR activity. This study provides new insights into the high onset overpotential of the ORR and offers potential strategies for predicting and enhancing ORR activity in the future.

Discovering new two-dimensional (2D) materials, exploring their unique properties and potentials in various applications are of paramount importance to condensed matter physics and materials science. Here based on the diverse properties of the novel square lattice S-XS2 materials found in experiments and computations, we identified 7 novel 2D Janus S-XSSe (X = Si, Sn, V, Cr, Mo, Re, Os) monolayers by means of density functional theory computations. Remarkably, both S-SiSSe and S-SnSSe monolayers possess the auxetic behavior. In addition, they can act as potential photocatalysts, and their photocatalytic performance can be enhanced by changing the pH and applying biaxial strains. Without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the S-VSSe, S-CrSSe, and S-MoSSe are ferromagnetic half-metals, and have high Curie temperatures TC (210, 810, and 390 K, respectively). When SOC is included, the S-VSSe becomes a quantum anomalous Hall insulator with a sizable gap (45.4 meV) and one chiral edge state (Chern number C = −1). By symmetry analysis of semiconducting S-XSSe (X = Si, Sn, V) monolayers, only out-of-plane piezoelectric response can be induced by a uniaxial strain in the basal plane, and among them, S-VSSe has both the largest out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients d31 and d32, with values of −0.013 and 0.025 pm V−1, respectively. The concurrence of ferromagnetism, topology, and piezoelectricity empowers the S-VSSe monolayer as a potential platform for multi-functional spintronics applications with a large gap and high TC. This theoretical work brings new members, also manifoldness in the properties and functions to the renown 2D materials family.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) is a promising alternative to energy and environmentally intensive production. Bulk electronic and surface structures affect the charge transport efficiency and catalytic activity of the photoelectrode. Herein, we design and investigate a hematite (Fe2O3) nanorod photoelectrode with hafnium and titanium binary dopants for highly selective H2O2 production. The resultant photoanode shows a H2O2 yield of 0.41 μmol min–1 cm–2 at 1.5 VRHE with a Faradaic efficiency of 72.2%. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrate the synergistic effect of Hf and gradient Ti doping on the hematite for the promising H2O2 performance. Hf doping effectively improves the crystallinity of Fe2O3, which favors improving the charge transport and reducing the charge recombination. Gradient Ti doping inhibits the collapse of the nanorod structure, increases the specific surface area, and introduces a large number of active sites on the surface. Ti- and Hf-codoped Ti/Hf:Fe2O3 photoanode improves the kinetics of H2O2 generation, leading to the high selectivity for H2O2 production and suppression of O2 production. This work provides the importance of hematite-based photoanodes toward the regulation of competition reactions for H2O2 production.

The usage of composite carbon-based materials supported by graphene has emerged as a powerful selection for designing electrocatalytic electrodes due to their agile electronic transmission and diversiform redox active sites. Here, we constructed fresh electroactive organic catalysts for hydrogen carrier synthesis by stacking a series of organic molecules on transition metal azide doped graphene substrates, in anticipation of these bilayer heterostructures to breathe new life into electrocatalysis. As expected, several promising cathodic catalysts were speculated through first principles calculations, such as Co-PMDT for H2 generation and Co-PQ for ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, facing such an intricate interface engineering and electronic structure regulation undoubtedly poses a challenge to the time-consuming computational screening work. To tackle this, an effective descriptor was proposed as a predictive tool for identifying the activity and selectivity toward diverse chemical reactions, which allows us to systematically fine-tune the catalysts' properties in order to enhance their electrocatalytic performance. Our work may offer feasible approaches for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts.

Urea generation through electrochemical CO2 and NO3− co-reduction reaction (CO2NO3RR) is still limited by either the low selectivity or yield rate of urea. Herein, we report copper carbonate hydroxide (Cu2(OH)2CO3) as an efficient CO2NO3RR electrocatalyst with an impressive urea Faradaic efficiency of 45.2% ± 2.1% and a high yield rate of 1564.5 ± 145.2 μg h−1 mgcat−1. More importantly, H2 evolution is fully inhibited on this electrocatalyst over a wide potential range between −0.3 and −0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Our thermodynamic simulation reveals that the first C-N coupling follows a unique pathway on Cu2(OH)2CO3 by combining the two intermediates, *COOH and *NHO. This work demonstrates that high selectivity and yield rate of urea can be simultaneously achieved on simple Cu-based electrocatalysts in CO2NO3RR, and provide guidance for rational design of more advanced catalysts.

We present a nonreactive force field for molecular dynamics simulations of interfaces between amorphous carbon surfaces and their interaction with water. The force field is tailored to surfaces with hydrogen, hydroxyl, and aromatic surface passivation and enables large-scale simulations of dry and lubricated tribological contacts. To favor its compatibility with existing force-field parameterizations for liquids and allow a straightforward extension to other types of surface passivation species, we adopt the functional form of the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations. The optimization of the force-field parameters is systematic and follows a protocol that can be reused for other surface–molecule combinations. Reference data are calculated with gradient- and dispersion-corrected density functional theory and include the bonding geometry and elastic deformation of bulk and surface species as well as surface adhesion and water adsorption energy landscapes. The conventions adopted to define the different force-field atom types are based on the hybridization of carbon orbitals and enable a simple and efficient parameter optimization strategy that only requires quantum-mechanical simulations of crystalline reference structures. After testing the force field on amorphous interfaces, we present two examples of application to tribological problems. Namely, we investigate the relationships between dry friction and the corrugation of the contact potential energy surface and the dependency of friction on the thickness of interface water films. We finally discuss the limitations of the force field and propose strategies for its improvement and extension.

The development of a fully ab initio theory for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) materials is a prominent challenge in computational chemistry and materials science. Here, quantum-mechanical density functional theory calculations are used to discover the mechanisms underlying the nucleation and growth of monolayer 2H molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) during organometallic CVD. Starting with molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as molecular precursors, we elucidate processes such as the decomposition of Mo(CO)6 to Mo(CO)3, sulfidation of Mo(CO)3, formation of metallic trigonal-phase (1T) Mo–S clusters, transition to semiconducting hexagonal-phase 2H MoS2, and the competition between the growth of Mo- and S-zigzag edges that lead to triangular and hexagonal flakes. We demonstrate thermodynamic and kinetic control over the formation of Mo- and S-zigzag edges. Additionally, we find the removal of hydrogen (H2) to be the rate-determining step in the growth process. We further compute the free energy of formation of the investigated Mo–S clusters on amorphous SiO2, demonstrating the important role played by the SiO2 substrate in the initial stages of nucleation and growth. We also show the feasibility of forming Mo–S clusters with more than two Mo atoms on the SiO2 surface. Our work lays the foundation for developing fully ab initio models of 2D material synthesis.

Methods for electronic structure computations, such as density functional theory (DFT), are routinely used for the calculation of spectroscopic parameters to establish and validate structure–parameter correlations. DFT calculations, however, are computationally expensive for large systems such as polymers. This work explores the machine learning (ML) of isotropic g values, giso, obtained from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments of an organic radical polymer. An ML model based on regression trees is trained on DFT-calculated g values of poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) polymer structures extracted from different time frames of a molecular dynamics trajectory. The DFT-derived g values, gisocalc, for different radical densities of PTMA, are compared against experimentally derived g values obtained from in operando EPR measurements of a PTMA-based organic radical battery. The ML-predicted giso values, gisopred, were compared with gisocalc to evaluate the performance of the model. Mean deviations of gisopred from gisocalc were found to be on the order of 0.0001. Furthermore, a performance evaluation on test structures from a separate MD trajectory indicated that the model is sensitive to the radical density and efficiently learns to predict giso values even for radical densities that were not part of the training data set. Since our trained model can reproduce the changes in giso along the MD trajectory and is sensitive to the extent of equilibration of the polymer structure, it is a promising alternative to computationally more expensive DFT methods, particularly for large systems that cannot be easily represented by a smaller model system.

A long-standing challenge in the design of single atom alloys (SAAs), for catalytic applications, is the determination of a feature space that maximally correlates to molecular binding energies per the Sabatier principle. The more representative a feature space is of the underlying binding properties, the greater the predictive capability of a given machine learning (ML) algorithm. Moreover, the greater the diversity and range of SAA impurities/sites examined, the greater the difficulty in arriving at such a predictive feature. In this work, we undertake to examine the degree to which adsorbate electronic structure properties might address this challenge, in a distinct departure from the traditional substrate electronic structure feature construction found in the catalysis literature. Specifically, as a model system, we explore the predictive capacity of the p-orbital projected density of states (PDOS) pertaining to the adsorption of CO molecules on a wide range of SAA substrates, impurity embeddings, and vicinal cuts. This analysis is executed in two parts. First, we explore the degree to which the entire PDOS distribution, in the form of an energy-dependent vector, can predict binding energies. Subsequently, guided by a rigorous intrinsic dimensionality analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection visualization, and chemical intuition, we are able to reduce the predictive feature space to just three physical quantities based on semicore level properties and charge filling of the adsorbate–as embedded with the PDOS distribution. This near-intrinsic feature space and the PDOS distribution are both shown to provide significant improvements in predictive accuracy when coupled with regression-based ML methods, even when tackling highly diverse chemical datasets. The results of this analysis both further substantiate the transferability characteristics of SAAs and indicate that adsorbate-based electronic structure features (from either relaxed or unrelaxed chemical datasets) are powerful tools in the prediction of catalytic binding energies in such systems. They also underscore the predictive benefit of finding a feature space with a dimension equal to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data that can maximally correlate with the physical property under investigation when employing ML methods in catalysis studies.

Abstract Azines are organic molecules with a C=N−N=C functional range of applications. But the conventional azines synthesis process requires a high reaction temperature and long reaction time combined with complex reaction facilities, so the synthesis process needs to be further improved in terms of economic efficiency and process simplification. Here, we demonstrate a structurally well‐defined inorganic ligand Ni compound, (NH 4 ) 4 [NiMo 6 O 18 (OH) 6 ](Ni‐POMs). The catalysts show good activity towards the reaction of carbonyl compounds, and the corresponding products can be obtained in yields up to about 90 %. In this condition, the majority of the aldehydes (aromatic and aliphatic) can be reacted, and the products are obtained in high yields. Density functional theory (DFT) looked into the process by which benzaldehyde and hydrazine hydrate reacted on the surface of Ni‐POMs. It was calculated that the whole reaction goes through two stages and the activation energy of the whole reaction is −6.72 kcal/mol. Thus, from experiment to calculation, a complete structure of the catalytic reaction cycle has been constructed.
