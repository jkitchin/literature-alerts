## CoTCNQ as a Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction: A First Principles r2SCAN Meta‐GGA Investigation

ABSTRACT Using first principles calculations we investigate cobalt‐coordinated tetracyanoquinodimethane (R‐CoTCNQ) as a potential catalyst for the CO 2 electroreduction reaction (CO 2 ERR). We determine that exchange–correlation functionals beyond the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are required to accurately describe the spin properties of R‐CoTCNQ, therefore, the meta‐GGA r 2 SCAN functional is used in this study. The free energy CO 2 ERR reaction pathways are calculated for the reduced catalyst ([R‐CoTCNQ] −1 e ) with reaction products HCOOH and HCHO predicted depending on our choice of electrode potential. Calculations are also performed for [R‐CoTCNQ] −1 e supported on a H‐terminated diamond (1 1 0) surface with reaction pathways being qualitatively similar to the [R‐CoTCNQ] −1 e monolayer. The inclusion of boron‐doping in the diamond support shows a slightly improved CO 2 ERR reaction pathway. Furthermore, structurally, supported R‐CoTCNQ provide a high specific area of active Co active sites and could be promising catalysts for future experimental consideration.

Writing scientific literature reviews is highly challenging, especially for broad topics like "heterogeneous catalysis" due to the explosion of knowledge. In this article, we introduce a machine-assisted approach aimed to facilitating this process. It integrates an automated summarization of several sources into the conventional method of writing a literature review. Our approach represents an initial trial to compile recent trends in heterogeneous catalysis. We chose the topic of heterogeneous catalysis due to its significance in various industrial processes and its multidisciplinary nature, which makes reviewing it challenging. The review highlights the pursuit of more advanced and complex catalysts to enhance catalytic performance. These advances significantly influence chemical reaction engineering, which combines reaction chemistry and chemical engineering. The trend of developing complex catalysts faces feasibility challenges, underscoring the importance of balancing practicality and potential benefits. In this interplay, the role of atomistic understanding becomes more important as it provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing catalyst behavior. Therefore, this review also covers advances in computational studies, particularly density functional theory calculations and the incorporation of new techniques. The wide scope of knowledge presented in this initial trial will facilitate further development in the field of chemical reaction engineering.

Abstract Nanoporous and chemically‐bridged graphene nanosheets span a wide chemical space with a broad set of applications in sensing and electronics. Modeling the structure and dynamics of such nanosheets is challenging, as chemical bond making and breaking as well as non‐covalent interactions must be captured accurately and on equal footing. Here it is showed that recent graph‐based machine‐learned force field (MLFF) SO3krates [J. T. Frank et al. , Nat. Commun. 15 , 6539 (2024)] is able to reliably model the dynamics and mechanical response for a broad class of nanoporous graphenes when trained on accurate density functional theory data that includes long‐range many‐body dispersion (MBD) interactions. In contrast, local moment tensor potentials and empirical reactive potentials are much less accurate. It is also found that recent MLFFs trained on solid‐state datasets must be used with care, since even empirical potentials occasionally yield more accurate results. These findings highlight the potential of properly‐trained graph MLFFs in modeling the properties of whole chemical spaces of complex functional materials.

Modeling adsorbates on single-crystal metals is critical in rational catalyst design and other research that requires detailed thermochemistry. First-principles simulations via density functional theory (DFT) are among the prevalent tools to acquire such information about surface species. While they are highly dependable, DFT calculations often require intensive computational resources and runtime. These limiting factors become particularly pronounced when investigating large sets of complex molecules on heavy noble metals. Consequently, our ability to explore these species and their corresponding energetics is limited. In this work, we establish a novel framework that utilizes techniques including molecular encoding, descriptor synthesis, and machine learning to overcome the limitation of costly DFT simulations. Simultaneously, we estimate thermochemical information efficiently at the DFT accuracy level. More specifically, we translated our training molecules into text-based identifiers through a simplified molecular-input line-entry system. Following that, we parametrize our training matrices with sets of short-range descriptors based on group methods, applying first the nearest neighbors to account for linear contributions. This is coupled with the long-range descriptors characterizing second nearest neighbors to account for nonlinear corrections. Finally, we use linear regression and machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian process regressions to regress over the linear and nonlinear matrix systems, respectively. This is the first work to our knowledge that encompasses both the first and second nearest neighbors based on the group theory throughout the featurization, training, and deployment stages. We trained and validated our models with 459 surface species on Pt(111), Ru(0001), and Ir(111) surfaces. Results exhibit robust performance to reproduce the energetics of interest, such as enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities, at various temperatures. Notably, the mean absolute errors can be reduced by 48% during training and 19% during prediction at a minimum, when compared to the classical group method. Leveraging the novel framework, our machine-learning-enabled thermochemistry estimator significantly empowers us to research the thermochemistry of complex species on metal catalysts.

Surface oxidation/reduction processes, driven by varying electrochemical potentials, can substantially impact catalyst effectiveness and, consequently, electrolyzer performance. This study combines theoretical and experimental approaches to explore the surface redox behavior of nickel oxides, which are cost-effective and efficient catalysts for many electrochemical reactions. Surface Pourbaix diagrams for three different phases of nickel oxides, i.e., nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2), nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), and nickel dioxide (NiO2), were constructed using density functional theory-based simulations. Various experimental methods, including cyclic voltammetry, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical titration, were employed to probe the surface redox processes of nickel oxide thin films. Our findings indicate that the ABAB stacking sequence of Ni(OH)2 lacks stability under oxidizing conditions to host the surface oxidation (deprotonation) events, while the AABBCC stacking sequence of NiOOH is energetically favorable due to the presence of interlayer hydrogen bonding. Rapid charge transfer facilitated by interlayer hydrogen bonding accounts for the higher reactivity of partially oxidized/reduced NiOOH (001) surfaces compared to Ni(OH)2 (001) and NiO2 (001) surfaces with the same stoichiometry, where interlayer hydrogen bonding is absent. Insights presented in this work can offer guidelines for optimizing operational conditions and tailoring the surface structures and oxidation states of nickel oxides to enhance performance in applications such as electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.

CNx catalysts show promising activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under acidic conditions, but the nature of the active site is still under debate. ORR on CNx has been found to be resistant to common poisons such as CO, H2S, and CN. In this study, we demonstrate that bubbling CO2 in the electrolyte can lead to the partial poisoning of CNx for ORR activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments show a partial decrease in the ORR activity for CNx catalysts after bubbling CO2 through a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. The relative stability of CO2-derived species (CO2*, H2CO3*, HCO3*, and CO3*) on 13 CNx site models at 1.0 V-RHE was examined using density functional theory (DFT). The calculations predict that HCO3 is favored adjacent to the N species on several CNx site models and CO3 is favored on pyrrolic sites. Difference spectra of the N 1s from near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) of the ex-situ poisoned CNx and pristine CNx shows a shift in binding energies of N species that qualitatively match the DFT N 1s binding energy shifts due to HCO3/CO3 on the CNx site models. DFT predicts that these HCO3 surface species can block and delay the initial step of the ORR on several CNx sites.

Abstract Effective first‐row transition metal‐based electrocatalysts are crucial for large‐scale hydrogen energy generation and anion exchange membrane (AEM) devices in water splitting. The present work describes that SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH nanosheets on nickel foam are used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and AEM water electrolyzer study. Tuning the Ni‐to‐Fe ratios in NiFe‐LDH and doping with Sm ions improves the electrical structure and intrinsic activity. SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH has higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, and TWS activity, achieving 10 mA cm⁻ 2 current density at lower overpotentials (230 mV, 95 mV, and 1.62 V, respectively). In AEMWE cells, SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH as a cathode and anode pair exhibits outstanding activity (0.9 A cm⁻ 2 at 2 V) and stability over 120 h. Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations reveal that the Sm doping in NiFe‐LDH surface enhances its bifunctional activity toward OER and HER. These findings emphasize the potential of non‐noble composites for long‐term water electrolysis in total water splitting and AEMWE applications.

Abstract The modular assembly of organic molecules commonly guides the design of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), yet the systematic exploration of inorganic building blocks remains limited. Given the promising applications in catalytic reactions and topological materials, the study of metal–inorganic frameworks (MIFs)—which fundamentally differ from the well‐established MOFs—has become urgent. This study introduces a strategy for designing MIFs using host atom‐centered building blocks, applied to the platinum–Phosphorus (Pt–P) system. By combining experimental observations with theoretical calculations, a Pt 18 P 18 framework utilizing PtP 3 building blocks, demonstrating significant energetic benefits is proposed. PtP 3 units are employed to characterize Pt 3 P 6 clusters within the pores, leading to a “compass” model that aligns with experimental findings. To address computational challenges associated with the large periodicity of the superstructure, a robust machine learning force field is developed. The analysis, combining surface nucleation studies, first‐principles calculations, and machine learning techniques, provides a comprehensive understanding of MIF structure. This validated Pt–P MIF exhibits exceptional catalytic properties with diverse reaction sites, significantly outperforming Pt(111) in the hydrogen evolution reaction. The findings not only present additional candidates for practical applications of metal phosphides but also highlight the vast potential of MIFs, paving the way for the discovery of numerous promising materials.

Abstract Perovskite oxides have been considered promising oxygen catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), owing to structural and compositional flexibility, and tailorable properties. Ingenious B‐site ordered La 1.5 Sr 0.5 NiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 O 6 (LSNMF) double perovskite is strategically designed by simultaneously interposing Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 and Ni 0.5 Fe 0.5 into B′ and B″ sites. Controlling B‐site cation systematically tailors the electronic structure of the B‐site cation with a d‐band center (M d ) upshift close to the Fermi level, increasing the overlap of the M d center and O 2p center (O P ). The strong interaction of M d and O p facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and activates the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process, thereby enhancing the ORR and OER activity. For ORR, LSNMF exhibited an onset potential of 0.9 V along with a high limiting current of −8.05 mA cm −2 . At the same time, for OER at 1 m KOH, LSNMF effectively reached a maximum current density of 3000 mA cm −2 . Most importantly, the difference between E ORR (at −1 mA cm −2 ) and E OER (at 10 mA cm −2 ), ΔE is 0.69 V, which stands among the best of recently reported perovskites. The as‐designed LSNMF is stable, efficient, lucrative, and a promising candidate for practical application.

Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source for low-carbon and sustainable mobility purposes. However, its applications are still limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. The complex nature of the ORR and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows. Here, we present a state-of-the-art study that combines classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate ORR on platinum-based surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the great potentiality of quantum computers in solving notoriously difficult systems with strongly correlated electronic structures and suggest platinum/cobalt as ideal candidate for showcasing quantum advantage in future applications.

Intermolecular vibrations are extremely challenging to describe but are the most crucial part for determining entropy and hence free energies and enable, for instance, the distinction between different crystal-packing arrangements of the same molecule via THz spectroscopy. Herein, we introduce a benchmark dataset—V30—containing 30 small molecular dimers with intermolecular interactions ranging from exclusively van der Waals dispersion to systems with hydrogen bonds. All the calculations are performed with the gold standard of quantum chemistry CCSD(T). We discuss vibrational frequencies obtained via different models starting with the harmonic approximation over independent Morse oscillators up to second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2), which allows a proper anharmonic treatment including coupling of vibrational modes. However, large amplitude motions present in many low-frequency intermolecular modes are problematic for VPT2. In analogy to the often used treatment for internal rotations, we replace such problematic modes by a simple one-dimensional hindered rotor model. We compare selected dimers to the available experimental data or high-level calculations of potential energy surfaces and show that VPT2 in combination with hindered rotors can yield a very good description of fundamental frequencies for the discussed subset of dimers involving small and semi-rigid molecules.

Host–guest interactions in porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) play a key role in enhancing the performance of these materials for practical applications; however, it is often very challenging to investigate these interactions at the molecular level. In recent years, many solid-state NMR (SSNMR) approaches, including in situ variable temperature (VT), 2D correlation, and pulsed field gradient (PFG) experiments, have offered unique insights into the local structure and dynamics of adsorbed guest molecules in MOFs and COFs. Recent SSNMR studies of MOFs and COFs containing guest molecules are summarized in this chapter. These reports encompass a variety of gaseous and liquid guests such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, water, and methanol. We also highlight studies involving larger guest molecules, drugs, and biomolecules. It is apparent that SSNMR spectroscopy can provide a wealth of data pertaining to host–guest interactions in these materials; the information available commonly includes the number and location of guest adsorption sites, guest binding strengths, guest dynamics and diffusion rates, and guest-induced structural changes in the host. The studies discussed in this chapter illustrate how SSNMR spectroscopy serves as a powerful tool to probe host–guest interactions in MOFs/COFs, especially given the variety of potential target nuclei and the numerous experimental strategies that are available.

Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its high gravimetric hydrogen capacity as well as the abundance and low cost of magnesium. The material's limiting factor is the high dehydrogenation temperature (over 300 °C) and sluggish (de)hydrogenation kinetics when no catalyst is present, making it impractical for onboard applications. Catalysts and physical restructuring (e.g., through ball milling) have both shown kinetic improvements, without full theoretical understanding as to why. In this work, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) for the Mg–H system, which was used to run long time scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a thick magnesium hydride surface slab for up to 1 ns. Our MLP-based MD simulations reveal previously unreported behavior of subsurface molecular H2 formation and subsequent trapping in the subsurface layer of MgH2. This hindered diffusion of subsurface H2 offers a partial explanation on the slow dehydrogenation kinetics of MgH2. The kinetics will be improved if a catalyst obstructs subsurface formation and trapping of H2 or if the diffusion of subsurface H2 is improved through defects created by physical restructuring.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile class of materials that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. A growing number of studies aim to identify potential new SACs or to describe their structure and reactivity through ab initio quantum chemical simulations. While many computational studies primarily address reactions involving small molecules, such as water splitting or CO2 reduction, the application scope of SACs is rapidly broadening to include the production of fine chemicals and the conversion of biomass-derived platform molecules, processes that involve larger, more complex reactants. Using density-functional theory (DFT) simulations, we demonstrate that, while an approximate treatment of entropy is acceptable for molecules with up to three atoms, it introduces substantial errors in reactions involving more complex molecules. Our results reveal a linear correlation between the entropy of adsorbed molecules and that of the corresponding isolated species, mirroring trends observed on extended catalytic surfaces. For the largest systems investigated in this study, the entropy of the free molecule is reduced by approximately 10–20% upon adsorption; for small molecules, this reduction can range from 50 to 70%. This disparity arises because, on SACs, the translational entropy is effectively zero, the rotational entropy is minimal, and the vibrational entropy increases with the size of the molecule. Moreover, the entropy of adsorbates scales linearly with the number of atoms in the molecule, allowing for the prediction of entropic contributions of adsorbates on SACs without additional computational cost. Using propyne hydrogenation as a test, we demonstrate that the reaction energy profile computed with current approximate approaches for estimating the entropy of adsorbates differs significantly from the profile where entropy is explicitly included. These findings highlight the importance of considering adsorbate entropy for accurately predicting the catalytic activity of SACs, particularly for reactions involving complex molecules.    

    

## Controlling Co 3d/O 2p Orbital Hybridization in LaCoO3 by Modulating the Co–O–Co Bond Angle for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysis

The orbital hybridization between metal and oxygen of perovskite catalysts can lower the overpotential and enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. This study combines density functional theory with experiments to clarify how Sr/Fe codoping modulates orbital hybridization and enhances OER catalytic activity of LaCoO3. The as-prepared La0.50Sr0.50Co0.75Fe0.25O3 shows remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm–2 current density and a 107.03 mV dec–1 Tafel slope, outperforming most state-of-the-art perovskite-based OER electrocatalysts. The experimental results confirm that Sr/Fe codoping enhances the expansion of Co–O–Co bond angles and strengthens the covalency of the Co–O bond in LaCoO3, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, increasing Sr doping reduces the distance between the Co 3d/O 2p center and the Fermi level, decreasing the energy difference between them and enhancing the degree of orbital hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p. As the degree of Co 3d/O 2p orbital hybridization increases, a higher charge transfer was found between the active center and intermediate product, OOH, reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step while lowering the overpotential. This study provides thorough insight into the rational design of OER catalysts based on orbital hybridization.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted the attention of the scientific community due to a number of attractive properties allowing their application in different catalytic processes, including electrochemical ones. Due to the nature of the active site, consisting of only a few atoms, SACs are also very attractive for theoretical modeling as the active site can be directly translated into the computational model. However, as a rule, the possibility of the active site change induced by pH and electrode potential is disregarded in theoretical models. This Perspective emphasizes the need to address the actual state of SA electrocatalysts under operating conditions before considering their catalytic activity and selectivity. The concept of surface Pourbaix plot, well-known in electrochemistry, can be directly transferred to SACs, providing valuable insights and guidance for developing novel catalytic materials. We discuss recent approaches to designing Pourbaix plots for SACs and outline the importance of properly treating the actual state of SACs and other emerging types of catalysts.

Adsorbate free energies are important parameters in surface chemistry and catalysis. Because of its simplicity, the harmonic oscillator (HO) model remains the most widely used method for calculating adsorbate free energy in many fields, including microkinetic modeling. However, it is well-known that the HO method is ineffective for weak adsorption. In this study, we propose a translational model with a diffusion barrier to calculate the state functions of near free translation. Furthermore, an effective mass is introduced in this model. To address hindered translation uniformly, a diffusion barrier-based damping function (DF) is proposed that effectively links the harmonic vibration and translation limits. Adsorbates are divided into three categories according to their adsorption strength and diffusion barrier height. Adsorbed hydrogen atoms have a strong binding energy and relatively high vibrational frequency but a low diffusion barrier. The HT and our proposed DF methods predict that the adsorbed hydrogen atoms behave as translation above room temperature, while the previous DF method predicts that they behave as vibration at any temperature. At last, the dehydrogenation reaction of propane on the Pt(111) surface was taken as an example to illustrate the influence of different methods on the thermodynamic functions.

Abstract High‐entropy‐alloy (HEA) nanocrystals hold immense potential for catalysis, offering virtually unlimited alloy combinations through the inclusion of at least five constituent elements in varying ratios. However, general and effective strategies for synthesizing libraries of HEA nanocrystals with controlled surface atomic structures remain scarce. In this study, a transferable strategy for developing a library of facet‐controlled seed@HEA nanocrystals through seed‐mediated growth is presented. The synthesis of seed@HEA core–shell nanocrystals incorporating up to ten different metallic elements, with control over the number of solid‐solution HEA atomic layers is demonstrated. Epitaxial HEA growth on nanocrystal seeds with low‐index and high‐index facets leads to the formation of seed@HEA catalyst library with composition‐ and facet‐dependent catalytic activities in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In situ synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and density‐functional theory calculations are employed to identify surface active sites of the HEA, rationalizing the high level of catalytic activities achieved. This work enables facet engineering in the multi‐elemental chemical space and unveils the critical needs for their future development toward catalysis.

Hydrogen emerges as a pivotal clean and versatile energy carrier amid global energy challenges, urging a shift towards renewable hydrogen production. The efficiency of the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hinges on catalyst choice, ambient conditions, and electrolyte pH. In transitioning away from costly and scarce catalysts like Pt or Ru, researchers explore Earth-abundant alternatives, notably transition metal-based quantum dots (QDs) and MXenes. QDs offer high surface area and customizable properties, while MXenes demonstrate exceptional conductivity and surface area. QDs, despite challenges such as agglomeration, prove effective when engineered into composites. MXenes, with their unique stacked structure and chemical robustness, hold promise for HER catalysis. As discussed, QDs and MXenes exhibit schematic HER representations, emphasizing their potential as catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production and their adaptability to span diverse fields, offering scalable solutions towards a renewable energy future.

Hydrogen is regarded as a vital resource for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. Electrocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a viable technique for producing ultra-pure hydrogen. The electrocatalyst, which can catalyze the electrochemical process to decrease the overpotential by increasing the current density, is critical to the effectiveness of this approach. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have become recognized as possible electrocatalysts in recent years due to their exposed surface active sites, evenly distributed interconnected pore structure, and adjustable shape. Thus, the significance of homogeneous and heterogeneous MOFs and their derivatives for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution process (HER) is summarized in this chapter. The chapter begins with an overview of the fundamentals of the electrocatalytic HER, after which the importance of various transition metal-based pristine MOFs and their derivatives towards the HER is examined. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement given their sub-par intrinsic activity and weak conductivity. Various MOF-derived composites, as well as new methodologies and procedures, are given to solve intrinsic activity and conductivity issues, emphasizing progress in MOF-based materials for a more effective HER electrocatalyst in large-scale hydrogen production.

Abstract The concentrated alkaline passivates the monolithic electrode for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) industry. Herein, a surface engineering of cathodic protection via one‐step co‐electrodeposition of P into NiCuV is presented and the achieved monolithic electrode exhibits an enhanced electrochemical catalytic behavior and constant durability with a feedback potential of −0.75 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under an extremely high current density of 1A cm −2 for more than 270 h in alkaline media. The strategy of cathodic protection optimises the charge density redistribution by forming a phosphate surface layer. This preserves the particular metal (alloy) phase from oxidation while also modulating the heterarchical porous structure through P incorporation. Furthermore, an anion‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with the NiCuVP serving as the HER catalyst and the NiFeCr LDH as the OER catalyst is constructed, which exhibits a current density of 912 mA cm −2 at 2 V at 80 °C with 30 wt.% KOH electrolytes. The resultant factors for activity and durability such as the electrochemical specific area, redox behaviors and surface hydrophilicity are also systematically discussed. This research presents a practical protocol for the anticorrosion and active enhancement of AWE and AEMWE cathodes.
