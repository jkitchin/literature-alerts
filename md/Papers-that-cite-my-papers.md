Abstract The proactive exploration of electrocatalytic conversion for renewable energy valorization is of tremendous significance in addressing the issues of fossil energy exhaustion, among which the critical challenge of electrocatalysis lies in the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts that are rich in the earth. Among electrocatalysts, the design of heterostructured materials exhibits immense potential for the optimization of noble metals and elaboration of non‐precious metal electrocatalysts with durability. In this review, a systematic overview of modern advances in heterostructured electrocatalysts for a range of energy conversion reactions is described, and special interfacial design brings additional functional effects. Subsequently, various synthesis methods and characterization techniques for heterostructured electrocatalysts are also summarized. The innovative classification of heterostructures in methods of interfacial junction, crystal structure, structural morphology, and properties of the components is presented in this review. Finally, the possible challenges and outlooks of heterostructured electrocatalysts in the future are further discussed, including how to develop more sophisticated synthesis, characterization, and theoretical calculation methods, which will serve as the guiding direction for a more rational interface design. This review aims to set the trajectory for providing meaningful inspiration and references in energy conversion by heterostructured electrocatalysts, advancing the process of carbon neutrality.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer an interesting opportunity for catalysis, particularly for metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) motifs by providing an organized porous structural pattern and well-defined active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key need for hydrogen fuel cells and related sustainable energy technologies. In this work, we leverage electrochemical testing with computational models to study the electronic and structural properties in the MOF systems and their relationship to ORR activity and stability based on dual transitional metal centers. The MOFs consist of two M1 metals with amine nodes coordinated to a single M2 metal with a phthalocyanine linker, where M1/M2 = Co, Ni, or Cu. Co-based metal centers, in particular Ni–Co, demonstrate the highest overall activity of all nine tested MOFs. Computationally, we identify the dominance of Co sites, relative higher importance of the M2 site, and the role of layer M1 interactions on the ORR activity. Selectivity measurements indicate that M1 sites of MOFs, particularly Co, exhibit the lowest (<4%), and Ni demonstrates the highest (>46%) two-electron selectivity, in good agreement with computational studies. Direct in situ stability characterization, measuring dissolved metal ions, and calculations, using an alkaline stability metric, confirm that Co is the most stable metal in the MOF, while Cu exhibits notable instability at the M1. Overall, this study reveals how atomistic coupling of electronic and structural properties affects the ORR performance of dual site MOF catalysts and opens new avenues for the tunable design and future development of these systems for practical electrochemical applications.

Abstract Neutral electrolysis to produce hydrogen is prime challenging owing to the sluggish kinetics of water dissociation for the electrochemical reduction of water to molecular hydrogen. An ion‐enriched electrode/electrolyte interface for electrocatalytic reactions can efficiently obtain a stable electrolysis system. Herein, we found that interfacial accumulated fluoride ions and the anchored Pt single atoms/nanoparticles in catalysts can improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of NiFe‐based hydroxide catalysts, prolonging the operating stability at high current density in neutral conditions. NiFe hydroxide electrode obtains an outstanding performance of 1000 mA cm −2 at low overpotential of 218 mV with 1000 h operation at 100 mA cm −2 . Electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the interfacial fluoride contributes to promote the adsorption of Pt to proton for sustaining a large current density at low potential, while the Pt single atoms/nanoparticles provide H adsorption sites. The synergy effect of F and Pt species promotes the formation of Pt─H and F─H bonds, which accelerate the adsorption and dissociation process of H 2 O and promote the HER reaction with a long‐term durability in neutral conditions.

Abstract The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has the potential to decarbonize industrial ammonia production. However, NRR has poor activity and selectivity versus the competing hydrogen evolution reaction for catalysts that adhere to scaling relations. Overcoming the limitations imposed by scaling relations requires more complex catalyst materials, however, evaluating materials beyond simple metal systems is a large combinatorial problem that requires an improved understanding of the electrocatalyst surface to rationally guide the discovery of superior catalysts. The study uses grand canonical density functional theory to uncover NRR trends on a large and disparate set of binary covalent alloys (BCA) with variable compositions and active‐site geometries. The studied BCAs generally follow scaling relations, albeit with larger variance and several systems that significantly break scaling. BCAs with early‐ to mid‐transition metals tend to lie near the volcano peak and activate the N 2 triple bond via a side‐on binding configuration. Trends in the BCA space cannot be readily predicted using simple electronic descriptors, which is ascribed to the large geometric variability of the BCA surfaces. It is anticipated that these findings will provide a foundation for the rational design of superior NRR electrocatalysts with increasing material complexity.

Abstract Surface defect-induced photoluminescence blinking is ubiquitous in lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs). Despite efforts to passivate the defects on perovskite QDs by chemically engineering ligand binding moieties, blinking accompanied by photodegradation still poses barriers to studying and implementing quantum-confined perovskite QDs in quantum emitters. We posited that the intermolecular interaction between ligands can affect the QD surface passivation. In the solid state, steric repulsions among bulky ligand tails prevent adequate QD surface ligand coverage. Alternatively, attractive π-π stacking between low-steric phenethylammonium (PEA) ligands promotes the formation of a nearly epitaxial surface ligand layer. Here, we demonstrate that single CsPbBr3 QDs covered by these PEA ligands are nearly non-blinking, with single photon purity reaching 98%. Moreover, these QDs exhibited no spectral shifting and photodegradations, and they remained blinking-free after 12 hours of continuous operation. Free of interferences from blinking and photodegradation, we present size-dependent exciton radiative rates and emission line widths of single CsPbBr3 QDs ranging from strongly to weakly confined regimes.

Effect of solvent at the water/solid interface plays a non-negligible role in chemical reactions. Explicit solvation has been proved for its important effect on thermodynamics and kinetics of catalytic reactions. However, systematic studies about this perspective are still absence. In this work, using the model of single platinum atom immobilized on the metal vacancies of a series of MXenes, we systematically investigate the implicit/explicit solvent effect on their catalytic performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We find that the solvent effect plays a significant role in affecting the calculation results for some systems. For TiNbC-PtNb, the value of ΔGH* decreases from -0.121 to -0.511 (-0.583) eV when considering implicit (explicit) correction, implying the decisive role of solvent effect for calculating HER in this system. Bader charge analysis and AIMD simulations reveal that TiNbC-PtNb surface is sensitive to H2O, thus causing this abnormal case. Surprisingly high-entropy phases of MXene overall are less sensitive to solvent compared to the pure phases, which could be due to their alloyed lattice with a strong ability against electronic and lattice fluctuations induced by solvent. Several systems like V2C-PtV, TiMoC-PtMo, and VNbC-PtV are predicted to be excellent electrocatalysts for alkaline HER with the appropriate Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and kinetic barrier of water. The perspective exemplified in this work highlights that more feasible operando should be considered, e.g., influence of water, to better simulate the reaction process. Our work suggests that Pt-doped MXenes are perfect systems for hosting atomic catalyst as well.

In this work, we investigate how exploiting symmetry when creating and modifying structural models may speed up global atomistic structure optimization. We propose a search strategy in which models start from high symmetry configurations and then gradually evolve into lower symmetry models. The algorithm is named cascading symmetry search and is shown to be highly efficient for a number of known surface reconstructions. We use our method for the sulfur-induced Cu (111) (43×43) surface reconstruction for which we identify a new highly stable structure that conforms with the experimental evidence.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2R) is a promising approach for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels using renewable energy sources. We investigated the mechanism of eCO2R for a small Cu8 cluster placed on SnO2 containing O vacancies using density functional theory and predicted current density and selectivity by microkinetics simulations within the computational hydrogen electrode model. Low and high H coverages were modeled by Cu8/SnO2-x and Cu8H6/SnO2-x models, using statistical methods to identify their most stable structures. Different CO2 adsorption modes on Cu8/SnO2-x and Cu8H6/SnO2-x surface models, all containing an O vacancy, resulted in distinct reaction pathways, leading to either HCOOH or CO. The preferred formation of HCOOH occurred upon CO2 adsorption on an O vacancy on the Cu8H6/SnO2-x surface, followed by sequential hydrogenation to HCOO and HCOOH. Adsorption of CO2 on Cu8/SnO2-x opened a facile pathway to CO. Electronic structure analysis revealed that differences in charge donation of Cu to the antibonding orbitals of CO2 can explain the predicted selectivity differences. The preferred adsorption mode of CO2 is bidentate at the Cu-SnO2-x interface. Our findings emphasize the role of H coverage on Cu on the selectivity of eCO2R for Cu/SnOx catalysts.

Since their introduction in 2004, high entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical and functional properties. Advances in our understanding of atomic-scale ordering and phase formation in HEAs have facilitated the development of fabrication techniques for synthesizing nanostructured HEAs. These materials hold immense potential for applications in various fields including automobile industries, aerospace engineering, microelectronics, and clean energy, where they serve as either structural or functional materials. In this comprehensive Review, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanical and functional properties of nanostructured HEAs, with a particular emphasis on the roles of different nanostructures in modulating these properties. To begin, we explore the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the formation and stability of nanostructures in HEAs. Subsequently, we delve into an examination of the mechanical and electrocatalytic properties exhibited by bulk or three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured HEAs, as well as nanosized HEAs in the form of zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, or two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets. Finally, we present an outlook on the current research landscape, highlighting the challenges and opportunities associated with nanostructure design and the understanding of structure-property relationships in nanostructured HEAs.

Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation offers an efficient, environmentally friendly, and energy-saving approach for ammonia synthesis. In this study, semiconductor materials, particularly graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) combined with single metal atoms, were theoretically investigated to identify promising candidates as nitrogen fixation photocatalysts. Initially, six different single 3d transition-metal atoms, i.e., V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, were loaded onto g-C3N4, and the optimal single-atom catalyst, Fe@g-C3N4, was selected through reaction energy calculations. This catalyst demonstrated excellent performance in terms of the electronic structure and light absorption properties. Furthermore, machine learning methods were applied to a limited sample set to predict a catalyst with a superior performance beyond the computational samples. Utilizing a backward elimination method and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) training, the key descriptors correlated with the target properties of the catalysts were identified. The SISSO descriptors, consisting of structural and electronic characteristic parameters, are interpretable and provide meaningful insights. Importantly, a catalyst, Ru@g-C3N4, with outstanding performance was predicted and verified by density functional theory calculations. This catalyst design strategy demonstrates promising results with limited computational data, highlighting the potential of combining theoretical simulations with machine learning methods for catalyst design.

This review discusses the recent developments of single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts toward CO2, CO, N2, and NO3– hydrogenation reactions in the electrocatalysis context, a natural expansion from the thermal catalysis origin where the concept of SAA was born and validated. Electrocatalytic hydrogenations of CO2, CO, NO3–, and N2 into value-added chemicals offer an attractive general route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions using renewable energy without H2 feed stream. These reactions typically involve multiple electron-transfer-coupled elementary reaction steps that are of broad relevance to many electrocatalytic applications, making them well-positioned for translational fundamental studies relevant to other emerging electrochemical reactions. While there has been exciting progress in SAA research for various thermal catalytic reactions in the last decade, the design, application, and characterization of SAA catalysts in electrocatalysis remain nascent with intriguing uncertainties and ample opportunities. We highlight the recent research findings in this growing area, where the SAAs, owing to their unique doped metal properties and atomically precise bimetallic synergies, promote selective reaction pathways by tuning binding energies and distributions of adsorbates/intermediates. We also provide our perspective on this growing research area's potential challenges and opportunities.

As one of the potential catalysts, disordered solid solution alloys can offer a wealth of catalytic sites. However, accurately evaluating their activity localization structure and overall activity from each individual site remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an approach based on density functional theory and machine learning was used to obtain a large number of sites of the Pt-Ru alloy as the model multisite catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Subsequently, a series of statistical approaches were employed to unveil the relationship between the geometric structure and overall activity.

The Ir-based electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have demonstrated remarkable durability. Enhancing the Ir-based electrocatalytic activity still remains crucial owing to the scarcity of iridium. Here, a high-temperature sintering technique is employed to fabricate a boron (B)-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 coating with an almost perfect rutile-type crystal structure on a corrosion-resistant titanium substrate, ensuring exceptional stability for the acidic OER. The B-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode fabricated in a mixed solution of 0.6 M H3BO3, exhibits an overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a lower Tafel slope of 34.2 mV dec−1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is far lower than the 272 mV overpotential and the 45.3 mV dec−1 of the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrode. The electrode possesses a minimal potential increase even after undergoing continuous OER for 400 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The incorporation of B species into IrO2-Ta2O5 effectively fine-tunes the electronic structure of Ir active sites, leading to a substantial enhancement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. This study provides promising prospects for reducing the energy consumption of noble IrO2-based electrocatalysts in the practical application of electrochemical industry for the acidic OER.

n-Butane dehydrogenation to butene and butadiene has recently gained increasing attention owing to the exploitation and development of shale gas as well as the rapid growth in the demand for synthetic rubber worldwide. In this work, the full n-butane dehydrogenation reaction network involving 568 elementary steps on Pt is established by using a chemical informatics approach to loop over all of the atoms and chemical bonds in n-butane. By combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Morgan molecular fingerprint method, and machine learning techniques, we have identified 208 elementary steps that contribute to the kinetically important reaction network, which presents some general guidelines for the formulation of mechanisms of great complexity. A detailed microkinetic analysis that ensures thermodynamic consistency is then performed, without and with the presence of H2 cofeeding, to assess the n-butane catalytic activity and butene selectivity. It turns out that in the absence of H2, the high coverages of the coke precursors give rise to a low catalytic activity due to the occupancy of a large number of active sites. The turnover frequencies for n-butane consumption and butene production rise rapidly as the H2/n-C4H10 ratio goes up from 0 to 1.33. Meanwhile, the selectivity toward 1-butene increases as well, whereas the selectivities toward 2-butene and 1,3-butadiene are not sensitive to the H2 partial pressure. The flux analysis reveals that the dominant reaction pathways for 1-butene and 2-butene follow the reverse Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism, and the byproducts are formed primarily by the C–C bond cleavage in CH3CCHC*. The C–H bond activation in n-butane is identified by the sensitivity analysis as the rate-limiting step for the overall reaction while the selectivities toward butenes are found to be controlled dominantly by the ease with which n-butane can be activated and how readily butenes can be deeply dehydrogenated.

In the application of renewable energy, the oxidation–reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two crucial reactions. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on metal-doped graphene have been widely employed due to their high activity and high atom utilization efficiency. However, the catalytic activity is significantly influenced by different metals and local coordination, making it challenging to efficiently screen through either experimental or density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To address this issue, this study employed a combination of DFT calculations and machine learning (DFT-ML) to investigate rare earth-modified carbon-based (RENxC6–x) electrocatalysts. Based on computational data from 75 catalysts, we trained two ML models to capture the underlying patterns of physical properties and overpotential. Subsequently, the candidate catalysts were screened, leading to the discovery of four ORR catalysts, nine OER catalysts, and five bifunctional electrocatalysts, all of which were thoroughly validated for their stability. Lastly, by integrating the ML models with the SHAP analysis framework, we revealed the influence of atomic radius, Pauling electronegativity, and other features on the catalytic activity. Additionally, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of potential catalysts through DFT calculations. The revolutionary DFT-ML approach provides a crucial driving force for the design and synthesis of potential catalysts in subsequent studies.

Abstract The versatile Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relation stipulates the kinetics of a reaction in terms of thermodynamics. Herein, we establish the BEP relation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from fundamental electrochemical principles leveraging the Butler-Volmer relation for a one-step, one-electron process and the transition state theory. Based on first-principles investigations of HER mechanisms on fourteen metal electrodes, we firmly justify the BEP relation solely using an easy-to compute hydrogen adsorption free energy and universal electrochemical constants.

Understanding the nonequilibrium transformation of nanocatalysts under reaction conditions is important because metastable atomic structures may be created during the process, which offers unique activities in reactions. Although reshaping of metal nanoparticles (NPs) under reaction conditions has been widely recognized, the dynamic reshaping process has been less studied at the atomic scale. Here, we develop an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo model to simulate the complete reshaping process of Pt nanoparticles in a CO environment and reveal the in situ formation of atomic clusters on the NP surface, a new type of active site beyond conventional understanding, boosting the reactivities in the CO oxidation reaction. Interestingly, highly active peninsula and inactive island clusters both form on the (111) facets and interchange in varying states of dynamic equilibrium, which influences the catalytic activities significantly. This study provides new fundamental knowledge of nanocatalysis and new guidance for the rational design of nanocatalysts.

## Physical Prior Mean Function-Driven Gaussian Processes Search for Minimum-Energy Reaction Paths with a Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Band: A General Method for Gas-Phase, Interfacial, and Bulk-Phase Reactions

The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method serves as an indispensable tool for computational chemists, offering insight into minimum-energy reaction paths (MEPs) by delineating both transition states (TSs) and intermediate nonstationary structures along reaction coordinates. However, executing CI-NEB calculations for reactions with extensive reaction coordinate spans necessitates a large number of images to ensure a reliable convergence of the MEPs and TS structures, presenting a computationally demanding optimization challenge, even with mildly costly electronic-structure methods. In this study, we advocate for the utilization of physically inspired prior mean function-based Gaussian processes (GPs) to expedite MEP exploration and TS optimization via the CI-NEB method. By incorporating reliable prior physical approximations into potential energy surface (PES) modeling, we demonstrate enhanced efficiency in multidimensional CI-NEB optimization with surrogate-based optimizers. Our physically informed GP approach not only outperforms traditional nonsurrogate-based optimizers in optimization efficiency but also on-the-fly learns the reaction path valley during optimization, culminating in significant advancements. The surrogate PES derived from our optimization exhibits high accuracy compared to true PES references, aligning with our emphasis on leveraging reliable physical priors for robust and efficient posterior mean learning in GPs. Through a systematic benchmark study encompassing various reaction pathways, including gas-phase, bulk-phase, and interfacial/surface reactions, our physical GPs consistently demonstrate superior efficiency and reliability. For instance, they outperform the popular fast inertial relaxation engine optimizer by approximately a factor of 10, showcasing their versatility and efficacy in exploring reaction mechanisms and surface reaction PESs.

It has been reported that it was selective to produce ammonia on metallic cobalt in the electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (eNORR), where hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cobalt outperforms face-centered cubic (fcc) cobalt. However, hydroxylamine is more selectively produced on a cobalt single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC). Herein, we uncover the structural sensitivity over hcp-Co, fcc-Co, and Co-SAC in eNORR by employing a recently developed constant potential simulation method and microkinetic modeling. It was found that the superior activity for ammonia production on hcp-Co can be attributed to its facile electron and proton transfer and a stronger lateral suppression effect from NO* over fcc-Co. The exceptional hydroxylamine selectivity on Co-SAC is due to the modified electronic structure, namely, a positively charged active center. It was found that it is more favorable to produce NOH* over hcp-Co and fcc-Co, while HNO* is more preferable on Co-SAC, which are firmly correlated with the vertical and strong NO adsorption on the former and the moderate adsorption on the latter. In other words, a key factor for selectivity control is the first step of NO* protonation. Therefore, the local structure and electronic structure of the catalysts can be critical in regulating the activity and selectivity in eNORR.

The attainment of carbon neutrality has become a global consensus as a result of the increasing environmental problems caused by the consumption of fossil fuels. To achieve this objective, there has been widespread attention towards the electrocatalytic reduction reaction of carbon dioxide driven by renewable energy sources due to its mild reaction conditions. In recent years, generating high value-added multicarbon products has been the focus of considerable research efforts. However, the process of generating these products has been restricted by the complexity of the reaction path, the limitations of the scaling relationship, and the poor adaptability to the reaction environment, thereby impeding previous studies from achieving efficient conversion at high current densities. As a result, a more suitable catalyst design strategy is required to obtain high value-added products. This study proposes that the design approach of tandem catalysis will be effective in generating multicarbon products by exploring the mechanism of C–C bond coupling and the configuration of the reaction environment. This research summaries the mechanism and design requirements of tandem catalysis scaled by different intermediates transport distances and review strategies of tandem catalyst configurations, such as nanostructures, phase-mixed, phase-separated, and application of special supports, in facilitating the generation of multicarbon products. The study provides suggestions for the design of CO2 electrocatalytic tandem catalysts and conclude with a discussion of possible future directions.

Numerous electrochemistry reactions require the precise calculation of the ion solvation energy. Despite the significant progress in the first-principles calculations for crystals and defect formation energies for solids, the liquid system free energy calculations still face many challenges. Ion solvation free energies can be calculated via different semiempirical ways, e.g., using implicit solvent models or cluster of explicit molecule models; however, systematically improving these models is difficult due to their lack of a solid theoretical base. A theoretically sound approach for calculating the free energy is to use thermodynamic integration. Nevertheless, owing to the difficulties of self-consistent convergence in first-principles calculations for unphysical atomic configurations, the computational alchemy approach has not been widely used for first-principles calculations. This study proposes a general approach to use first-principles computational alchemy for calculating the ion solvation energy. This approach is also applicable for other small molecules. The calculated ion solvation free energies for Li+, Na+, K+, Be2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ are close to the experimental results, and the standard deviation due to molecular dynamics fluctuations is within 0.06 eV.

The reaction rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important factor restricting its application. In this work, we have systematic explorated of N, O coordination number on the catalytic performance for ORR and OER. Firstly, a variety of stability analysis methods show that most of the catalysts have excellent stability. Secondly, a series of excellent bifunctional catalysts are screened by volcanic maps, ORR overpotential (ηORR), OER overpotential (ηOER), and bifunctional index (BI), such as, RhN3O1-1 (ηORR = 0.28 V, ηOER = 0.34 V, BI = 0.62 V) and CoN3O1-1 (ηORR = 0.33 V, ηOER = 0.37 V, BI = 0.70 V). In particular, RhN3O1-1 has the smallest BI value, indicating that it has the best bifunctional catalytic activity. This study offers insights into how the coordination environment affects the activity of OER/ORR.

Recent advancements in automatic differentiation, which played a pivotal role in deep learning, offer a promising approach to addressing challenges in controlling fluid flow behavior. We demonstrate the power of the method by optimizing the packing of a polydisperse system of periodically arranged circular rods to minimize the pressure drop across the media. We show how the optimum topology of the porous media changes with changing the packing fraction.
