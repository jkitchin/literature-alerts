Shape-controlled alloy nanoparticle catalysts have been shown to exhibit improved performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in liquid half-cells. However, translating the success to catalyst layers in fuel cells faces challenges due to the more demanding operation conditions in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Balancing durability and activity is crucial. Here, we developed a strategy that limits the atomic diffusion within surface layers, fostering the phase transition and shape retention during thermal treatment. This enables selective transformation of platinum-iron nanowire surfaces into intermetallic structures via atomic ordering at a low temperature. The catalysts exhibit enhanced MEA stability with 50% less Fe loss while maintaining high catalytic activity comparable to that in half-cells. Density functional calculations suggest that the ordered intermetallic surface stabilizes morphology against rapid corrosion and improves the ORR activity. The surface engineering through atomic ordering presents potential for practical application in fuel cells with shape-controlled Pt-based alloy catalysts.

Inorganic semiconductor materials are crucial for modern technologies, but their brittleness and limited processability hinder the development of flexible, wearable, and miniaturized electronics. The recent discovery of room-temperature plasticity in some inorganic semiconductors offers a promising solution, but the deformation mechanisms remain controversial. Here, we investigate the deformation of indium selenide, a two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductor with substantial plasticity. By developing a machine-learned deep potential, we perform atomistic simulations that capture the deformation features of hexagonal indium selenide upon out-of-plane compression. Unexpectedly, we find that indium selenide plastifies through a martensitic transformation; that is, the layered hexagonal structure is converted to a tetragonal lattice with specific orientation relationship. This observation is corroborated by high-resolution experimental observations and theory. It suggests a change of paradigm, where the design of new plastically deformable inorganic semiconductors can focus on compositions and structures that facilitate phase transformations, going beyond the conventional dislocation slip.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have the advantages of good active site uniformity, high atom utilization, and high catalytic activity. However, the study of its controllable synthesis still needs to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we deposited Cu SAs on nanoporous N-doped graphene by underpotential deposition and further obtained a Pt SAC by a galvanic process. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses showed that the pyridine-like N defect sites are the specific sites for the underpotential-deposited SAs. The obtained Pt SAC exhibits a good activity in a hydrogen evolution reaction with a turnover frequency of 25.1 s−1. This work reveals the specific sites of UPD of SAs on N-doped graphene and their potential applications in HERs, which provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of SACs.

Bimetallic platinum-containing catalysts are deemed promising for electrolyzers and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). A significant number of laboratory studies and commercial offers are related to PtNi/C and PtCo/C electrocatalysts. The behavior of PtPd/C catalysts has been studied much less, although palladium itself is the metal closest to platinum in its properties. Using a series of characterization methods, this paper presents a comparative study of structural characteristics of the commercial PtPd/C catalysts containing 38% wt. of precious metals and the well-known HiSpec4000 Pt/C catalyst. The electrochemical behavior of the catalysts was studied both in a three-electrode electrochemical cell and in the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) of hydrogen–air PEMFCs. Both PtPd/C samples demonstrated higher values of the electrochemically active surface area, as well as greater specific and mass activity in the oxygen reduction reaction in comparison with conventional Pt/C, while not being inferior to the latter in durability. The MEA based on the best of the PtPd/C catalysts also exhibited higher performance in single tests and long-term durability testing. The results of this study conducted indicate the prospects of using bimetallic PtPd/C materials for cathode catalysts in PEMFCs.

Abstract The development of oxygen‐dependent fuel cells is frequently hindered by the high cost of cathode materials and the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It is thus crucial to explore low‐cost and high‐activity catalysts with accelerated mass transport. Here, a high‐throughput screening method is developed by integrating an explicit solvation model with machine learning potential‐based molecular dynamics simulations, which enables the efficient evaluation of a vast array of diverse diatomic combinations and ultimately identifying Fe–Co dual‐atomic sites as the optimal ORR electrocatalysts. The superior electrocatalytic performance of the diatomic Fe/Co sites loaded on 3D‐interconnected ordered macroporous carbon (FeCo‐3DMNC) is experimentally verified, achieving high ORR activity with half‐wave potentials of 0.806 V in acidic and 0.905 V in alkaline environments. Additionally, innovative hybrid acid/alkali aluminum–air fuel cells (hA/A‐AAFCs) incorporating FeCo‐3DMNC as the cathode catalyst demonstrate a notably high open‐circuit voltage of 2.72 V and a record‐breaking power density of 827 mW cm −2 , significantly outperforming conventional alkaline aluminum–air fuel cells. This work marks a significant advancement by combining cutting‐edge computational screening with rigorous experimental validation to develop promising electrocatalysts, potentially paving the way for the advanced energy storage and conversion technologies.

The development of highly catalytic activity, low-cost and environmentally friendly catalysts is crucial for the use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to treat organic pollutants. In this study, to reduce costs, enhance catalytic activity and avoid secondary pollution form metal ions, pomelo peel was used as raw material, combined with surface crystallization, carbon layer protection and heat treatment technology to effectively construct AOPs catalyst that can efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade harmful organic pollutants. Under the optimal conditions, the Co/BC-PMS system can degrade about 100 % of tetracycline (TC, a spectral antibiotic) within 5 min, and the degradation rate of TC can still reach 100 % even if Co/BC (cobalt anchored on biochar) was reused for 6 times. The Co/BC-PMS system can resist complex environmental conditions, including acidic solution, alkaline solution, coexisting ions, different water quality, and is universal for the degradation of most organic pollutants. The integrated purification column with Co/BC as the core realizes the continuous and complete degradation of organic pollutants and has the ability of practical application. Radical capture and monitoring combined with density-functional-theory calculations confirmed that the Co(111) and amorphous CoO sites in Co/BC are the key to driving PMS to degrade organic pollutants, Co/BC can efficiently adsorb PMS and promote the dissociation of PMS into highly active OH, SO

The transformative impact of modern computational paradigms and technologies, such as high-performance computing (HPC), quantum computing, and cloud computing, has opened up profound new opportunities for scientific simulations. Scalable computational chemistry is one beneficiary of this technological progress. The main focus of this paper is on the performance of various quantum chemical formulations, ranging from low-order methods to high-accuracy approaches, implemented in different computational chemistry packages and libraries, such as NWChem, NWChemEx, Scalable Predictive Methods for Excitations and Correlated Phenomena, ExaChem, and Fermi–Löwdin orbital self-interaction correction on Azure Quantum Elements, Microsoft's cloud services platform for scientific discovery. We pay particular attention to the intricate workflows for performing complex chemistry simulations, associated data curation, and mechanisms for accuracy assessment, which is demonstrated with the Arrows automated workflow for high throughput simulations. Finally, we provide a perspective on the role of cloud computing in supporting the mission of leadership computational facilities.

Catalysis of multicomponent transformations requires controlled assembly of reactants within the active site. Supramolecular scaffolds possess synthetic microenvironments that enable precise modulation over noncovalent interactions (NCIs) engaged by reactive, encapsulated species. While molecular properties that describe the behavior of single guests in host cavities have been studied extensively, multicomponent transformations remain challenging to design and deploy. Here, simple univariate regression and threshold analyses are employed to model reactivity in a cascade reduction of azaarenes catalyzed by water-soluble metal organic cages. Yield and stereoselectivity models help deduce unknown mechanisms of reactivity by the multicomponent, host–guest complexes. Furthermore, a comprehensive model is established for NCIs driving stereoselectivity in the reported host–guest adducts.

To quickly and efficiently screen catalytic materials with both activity and selectivity for the nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR), we adopted a strategy that considers the activity of the side reaction hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) first. It can be seen that Fe3(THT)2 (THT = triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexathiol) has extremely excellent HER activity, with a Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of 0.007 eV. Based on the relationship between ΔG and theoretical exchange current density, all TM3(THT)2 can be divided into two regions: one is the absolute values of ΔG greater than 1 eV, the other is the absolute values of ΔG greater than 0 eV and less than 1eV. Obviously, the candidates with the absolute values of ΔG greater than 1 eV have poor HER performance, but this precisely provides the possibility of obtaining NORR catalytic materials with both excellent selectivity and activity. Subsequent calculation results show that the maximum ΔG change of the rate-determining step of Ta3(THT)2 is unexpectedly only 0.05 eV. Therefore, Ta3(THT)2 may be regarded as the NORR catalytic material with both excellent performance and selectivity. Based on the electron transfer and partial density of states (PDOS) analysis, it can be seen that Ta plays a crucial role in the activation stage of NO. The approach that considers the activity of the side reaction HER first may provide a new idea for rapidly screening highly selective and active NORR catalysts.

Abstract Hydrogen energy from electrocatalysis driven by sustainable energy has emerged as a solution against the background of carbon neutrality. Proton exchange membrane (PEM)‐based electrocatalytic systems represent a promising technology for hydrogen production, which is equipped to combine efficiently with intermittent electricity from renewable energy sources. In this review, PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems for H 2 production are summarized systematically from low to high operating temperature systems. When the operating temperature is below 130°C, the representative device is a PEM water electrolyzer; its core components and respective functions, research status, and design strategies of key materials especially in electrocatalysts are presented and discussed. However, strong acidity, highly oxidative operating conditions, and the sluggish kinetics of the anode reaction of PEM water electrolyzers have limited their further development and shifted our attention to higher operating temperature PEM systems. Increasing the temperature of PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems can cause an increase in current density, accelerate reaction kinetics and gas transport and reduce the ohmic value, activation losses, Δ G H* , and power consumption. Moreover, further increasing the operating temperature (120–300°C) of PEM‐based devices endows various hydrogen carriers (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and ammonia) with electrolysis, offering a new opportunity to produce hydrogen using PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems. Finally, several future directions and prospects for developing PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems for H 2 production are proposed through devoting more efforts to the key components of devices and reduction of costs.

Abstract Designing spinel nanocrystals (NCs) with tailored structural composition and cation distribution is crucial for superior catalytic performance but remarkably challenging due to their intricate nature. Here, an aggregation growth restricted hot‐injection method is presented by meticulously investigating the fundamental nucleation and aggregation‐driven growth kinetics governing spinel NC formation to address this challenge. Through controlled collision probability of nuclei during growth, this approach enables the synthesis of spinel NCs with unprecedented, single nanometer (1.2 nm). Single‐nanometer CoMn 2 O 4 spinel via this method exhibits a highly tailored structure with a maximized population of highly active octahedral Mn atoms, thereby optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, it exhibits a remarkable half‐wave potential of 0.88 V in ORR and leads to a superior power density (170.9 mW cm −2 ) in zinc–air battery, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most reported spinel oxides, revealing a clear structure–property relationship. This structure design strategy is readily adaptable for the precise synthesis and engineering of various spinel structures, opening new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts and energy storage materials.

We uncover the origin of unique electronic structures of single-atom alloys (SAAs) by interpretable deep learning. The approach integrates tight-binding moment theory with graph neural networks to accurately describe the local electronic structure of transition and noble metal sites upon perturbation. We emphasize the complex interplay of interatomic orbital coupling and on-site orbital resonance, which shapes the d-band characteristics of an active site, shedding light on the origin of free-atom-like d-states that are often observed in SAAs involving d10 metal hosts. This theory-infused neural network approach significantly enhances our understanding of the electronic properties of single-site catalytic materials beyond traditional theories.

Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is a versatile and zero‐emission material that is widely used in the industrial, domestic, and healthcare sectors. It is clear that it plays a critical role in advancing environmental sustainability, acting as a green energy source, and protecting human health. Conventional production techniques focused on anthraquinone oxidation, however, electrocatalytic synthesis has arisen as a means of utilizing renewable energy sources in conjunction with available resources like oxygen and water. These strides represent a substantial change toward more environmentally and energy‐friendly H 2 O 2 manufacturing techniques that are in line with current environmental and energy goals. This work reviews recent advances in two‐electron water oxidation reaction (2e‐WOR) electrocatalysts, including design principles and reaction mechanisms, examines catalyst design alternatives and experimental characterization techniques, proposes standardized assessment criteria, investigates the impact of the interfacial milieu on the reaction, and discusses the value of in situ characterization and molecular dynamics simulations as a supplement to traditional experimental techniques and theoretical simulations, as shown in Figure 1. The review also emphasizes the importance of device design, interface, and surface engineering in improving the production of H 2 O 2 . Through adjustments to the chemical microenvironment, catalysts can demonstrate improved performance, opening the door for commercial applications that are scalable through tandem cell development.

Hydrogen has been widely used in industrial and commercial applications as a carbon-free, efficient energy source. Due to the high flammability and explosion risk of hydrogen–air mixtures, it is vital to develop sensors featuring fast-responding and high sensitivity for hydrogen leakage detection. This paper presents a miniaturized electrochemical gas sensor by elaborately establishing a nanocomposite and thin ionic liquid interface for highly sensitive and rapid electrochemical detection of hydrogen, in which a remarkable response time and recovery time of approximately 6 s was achieved at room temperature. A screen-printed carbon electrode was modified with a reduced graphene oxide–carbon nanotube (rGO-CNT) hybrid and platinum–palladium (Pt–Pd) bimetallic nanoparticles to realize high sensitivity. To achieve miniaturization and high stability of the sensor, a thin-film room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) was employed as the electrolyte with a significantly decreased response time. The fast-responding hydrogen sensor demonstrates excellent performance with high sensitivity, linearity, and repeatability at concentrations below the lower explosive limit of 4 vol %. The engineered high-performance interface and gas sensor provide a promising and effective strategy for gas sensor design and rapid hazardous gas monitoring.

Abstract Both commercially available and laboratory-synthesized IrO2 catalysts typically possess rutile-type structures and diverse facet orientations. According to the theoretical results from density functional theory calculations, distinct IrO2 facets will result in divergent electrocatalytic properties, among which the (101) crystal facet is theoretically predicted as the most energetically favorable for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to its lowest energy barrier. Maintaining a single-unit-cell thickness while exposing a desired facet of 2D IrO2 presents a significant opportunity and challenge for the development of high-performance OER anode catalysts. Herein, we develop an ammonia-induced facet engineering for oriented modulation of crystal facets in the ultimate limit of monolayer thickness, and successfully synthesize 2D monolayer IrO2 exposing unique (101) facet. At the current density of 10 mA cm-2geo, an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV has been achieved on the highly activated (101) facet in a three-electrode system. More importantly, in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, the IrO2 anode reaches a low voltage of 1.74 V at an industrial-level current density of 2 A cm-2geo, much lower than that of all commercial IrO2 electrocatalysts. Though facet engineering primarily contributes to modulating the intrinsic activity rather than stability, the as-prepared IrO2(101) monolayer performs over 8,000 hours of PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) stability at constant 1.5 A cm-2geo, with a negligible decay rate of 4.0 mV kh-1. Furthermore, even a long-term PEMWE test of 1000 h using the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with ultra-low Ir loading of 0.2 mgIr cm-2geo under fluctuating operating conditions is performed, ECell remains highly electrochemically stable over time at 1.5 A cm-2geo, without any signs of catalyst degradation. This work proposes that ammonia-induced facet engineering of 2D monolayer IrO2 could represent a novel approach to selectively expose the desired (101) facet, thereby enabling unique facet-dependent OER performance and ultrahigh stability in industrial-scale PEM electrolysis, even under voltage fluctuations generated by solar and wind power.

Abstract The exploration of a new conceptual strategy for improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of earth‐abundant electrocatalysts is critical. In this study, chiral copper oxide nanoflower is explored by a self‐assembly method. The characterization suggests the chiral structure originates from the crystal plane‐level helical stack of the secondary nanosheets. Of note, the assembly illustrates a record‐high degree of spin polarization of 96%, indicating the ideal alignment of electron spin. Moreover, density function theory calculations show the chiral structure reducing the reaction energy barrier (REB) while switching the potential‐determining step from *O→*OOH to *OH→*O. Together with the enhanced electrochemical active surface area and accelerated charge transfer, the production of ground‐state triplet O 2 is improved via a spin‐forbidden route that involves the singlet H 2 O/OH•. Consequently, the chiral nanoflower shows a overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 93.5 mV dec −1 , which is even superior to the commercial RuO 2 (310 mV, 101 mV dec −1 ). This study presents a new strategy for improving the OER activity by simultaneously enhancing electronic properties and lowering the REB of an non‐noble electrocatalyst via chirality engineering.

Abstract The development of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts is essential for hydrogen production from acidic water splitting. Herein, a TiO 2 nanotube‐loaded Co‐doped Ru nanoparticle catalyst (RuCo/TiO 2 NTs) is reported that exhibits excellent activity and stability toward acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Ru─O─Ti bonding is enhanced by Co doping, and the metal carrier interaction between Ru nanoparticles and TiO 2 NTs is enhanced, which effectively stabilizes Ru species during OER and initiates hydrogen spillover accelerating HER kinetics. As a result, RuCo/TiO 2 NTs catalyst requires only 156 mV OER overpotential and 17 mV HER overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 with a stability more than 500 h in acidic conditions. More importantly, benefiting from the excellent bifunctional activities, the proton exchange membrane electrolyte assembled from RuCo/TiO 2 NTs has excellent activity and robust stability (1000 h). This work opens a new avenue for the efficient energy conversion devices.

ABSTRACT Beyond addressing technological demands, the integration of machine learning (ML) into human societies has also promoted sustainability through the adoption of digitalized protocols. Despite these advantages and the abundance of available toolkits, a substantial implementation gap is preventing the widespread incorporation of ML protocols into the computational and experimental chemistry communities. In this work, we introduce ROBERT, a software carefully crafted to make ML more accessible to chemists of all programming skill levels, while achieving results comparable to those of field experts. We conducted benchmarking using six recent ML studies in chemistry containing from 18 to 4149 entries. Furthermore, we demonstrated the program's ability to initiate workflows directly from SMILES strings, which simplifies the generation of ML predictors for common chemistry problems. To assess ROBERT's practicality in real‐life scenarios, we employed it to discover new luminescent Pd complexes with a modest dataset of 23 points, a frequently encountered scenario in experimental studies.
