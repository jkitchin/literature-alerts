Los indicadores de citación pueden medir el impacto o la utilidad de resultados de investigación de un artículo científico, sin embargo, este uso puede ser controversial. Factores intrínsecos y extrínsecos influencian la citación de un artículo, sin mencionar que el comportamiento en las citaciones puede variar entre áreas temáticas, lo cual dificulta las comparaciones entre artículos y disciplinas. Entender que el contexto puede afectar un análisis de citas es esencial para interpretar adecuadamente los indicadores. Por esta razón, buscan reconocerse los factores que inciden en la citación de los artículos de las revistas biomédicas colombianas indexadas en Scopus a través del uso de algoritmos de Machine Learning. Con los algoritmos ‘Gradient Boosting Classifier’ y ‘Light Gradient Boosting Machine’ identificamos características de importancia como el índice h del primer y el último autor, acceso abierto, número de autores, palabras clave del artículo, además del número de páginas. Estas características fueron relevantes para el área de interés y pueden brindar un contexto para futuros análisis, considerando que lo relevante de un artículo no debería ser cuántas citaciones atrae, sino si este ayuda a llenar vacíos en el conocimiento.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a chemical reaction in the process of generating molecular oxygen in the oxidation of water during oxygenic photosynthesis, electrolysis of water into oxygen and hydrogen, and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Noble metal oxides such as ruthenium and iridium oxides have good electrocatalytic activity for the OER process, but they have disadvantages such as high cost, inaccessibility, limited reserves, and durability. Therefore, the design and preparation of a low-cost, highly active, and high stable performance catalyst is necessary. In this regard, dual-atom catalysts (DACs) are a suitable option according to their characterization such as good electrocatalytic activity, high atomic efficiency, and synergic effects. Their atomically dispersed active sites lead to maximum utilization efficiency of the metal sites. This chapter presents an outlook on the design, catalytic mechanism, and application of dual-atom catalysts in oxygen evolution reactions.

Since the oxygen is in a triplet state and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is related to the electron spin state, it is possible to improve the catalytic ability by regulating the spin state of the catalyst. From this point of view, we first introduce the unique electronic structure of oxygen, oxygen evolution reaction products, and then detail the mechanism of electron spin correlation in the entire oxygen evolution reaction, and how the catalyst affects this electron spin state, thereby affecting the catalytic reaction rate. Then, we introduced the research on the regulation of the electron spin states of the catalyst. Since the research dimension of the electron spin states is mostly concentrated at the atomic level, the unique atomic structure of the single-atom catalyst is more conducive to the first research. Therefore, we introduced the research on the spin state regulation of the single-atom catalyst. The spin state control at the atomic level of catalysts such as spinel is further introduced. Finally, the research on spin state regulation of oxygen evolution catalysts was summarized and prospected. In the future, the mechanism of spin state regulation of catalysts at the atomic level should be studied more clearly by developing in situ characterization techniques.

The wide product spectrum resulting from the intricate reactions of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) makes CO2RR unfavorable for industrial electrolysis. Herein, we demonstrate a hydrogen-feeding effect from copper-silica catalysts that can regulate CO2RR product selectivity via modulation of Cu dispersion in the copper-silica core-shell particles. We found electromethanation of CO2 is greatly enhanced on Cu-Si catalyst with optimally dispersed Cu nanoparticles, resulting in a high methane Faradaic efficiency of 72.9 %. In contrast, a lower or higher Cu dispersion correlated to a preferential (co-)production of methane and ethylene or hydrogen. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and spectroscopic analysis, we show Cu dispersion affects the Cu coverage on SiO2 and the exposure of Cu-O-Si interfacial sites for CO2RR and water dissociation. An optimum Cu dispersion creates abundant Cu-O-Si sites with reduced energy barriers for both the hydrogenation of *CHO and water dissociation, leading to selective methane formation.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, three-dimensional structures with high surface areas and tunable porosities. Made from metal nodes connected by organic linkers, the exact properties of a given MOF are determined by node and linker choice. MOFs hold promise for numerous applications, including gas capture and storage. M2(4,4′-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate)—henceforth simply M2(dobpdc), with M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, or Zn—is regarded as one of the most promising structures for CO2 capture applications. Further modification of the MOF with diamines or tetramines can significantly boost gas species selectivity, a necessity for the ultra-dilute CO2 concentrations in the direct-air capture of CO2. There are countless potential diamines and tetramines, paving the way for a vast number of potential sorbents to be probed for CO2 adsorption properties. The number of amines and their configuration in the MOF pore are key drivers of CO2 adsorption capacity and kinetics, and so a validation of computational prediction of these quantities is required to suitably use computational methods in the discovery and screening of amine-functionalized sorbents. In this work, we study the predictive accuracy of density functional theory and related calculations on amine loading and configuration for one diamine and two tetramines. In particular, we explore the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and its formulation for solids (PBEsol) with and without the Grimme-D2 and Grimme-D3 pairwise corrections (PBE+D2/3 and PBEsol+D2/3), two revised PBE functionals with the Grimme-D2 and Grimme-D3 pairwise corrections (RPBE+D2/3 and revPBE+D2/3), and the nonlocal van der Waals correlation (vdW-DF2) functional. We also investigate a universal graph deep learning interatomic potential’s (M3GNet) predictive accuracy for loading and configuration. These results allow us to identify a useful screening procedure for configuration prediction that has a coarse component for quick evaluation and a higher accuracy component for detailed analysis. Our general observation is that the neural network-based potential can be used as a high-level and rapid screening tool, whereas PBEsol+D3 gives a completely qualitatively predictive picture across all systems studied, and can thus be used for high accuracy motif predictions. We close by briefly exploring the predictions of relative thermal stability for the different functionals and dispersion corrections.

Abstract This article introduces neural graph distance embedding (nGDE), a method for generating 3D molecular geometries. Leveraging a graph neural network trained on the OE62 dataset of molecular geometries, nGDE predicts interatomic distances based on molecular graphs. These distances are then used in multidimensional scaling to produce 3D geometries, subsequently refined with standard bioorganic forcefields. The machine learning‐based graph distance introduced herein is found to be an improvement over the conventional shortest path distances used in graph drawing. Comparative analysis with a state‐of‐the‐art distance geometry method demonstrates nGDE's competitive performance, particularly showcasing robustness in handling polycyclic molecules—a challenge for existing methods.

Abstract A crucial factor in advancing the broad utilization of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the development of efficient catalysts with sufficient active sites. Herein, a hydrothermal approach is utilized to fabricate helical chain stacked two‐dimensional (2D) tellurium (Te) nanoflakes, whose HER performance hasn't been systematically studied yet. It is found that Te nanoflakes transferred on carbon fiber paper (CFP) exhibit impressive HER properties and show a load dependence. The overpotential required for HER is significantly reduced to 279 mV under a load condition of 0.86 mg cm −2 at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further systematically carried out on Te catalytic sites along the helical chain at [0001] direction with a threefold screw symmetry. It is found that the Gibbs free energy of adsorbed hydrogen atom (ΔG H* ) on Te sites is significantly lower than that of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ). Besides, the active sites based on surface atom density calculation reveal that Te provides more adsorption sites than layered MoS 2 . The decreased adsorption energy and efficient adsorption sites in Te may highlight the promising application of elemental crystal Te in electrocatalytic hydrogen production and pave the way for developing new types of electrocatalysts.

Abstract Water electrolyzers powered by renewable energy are emerging as clean and sustainable technology for producing hydrogen without carbon emissions. Specifically, anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzers utilizing non‐platinum group metal (non‐PGM) catalysts have garnered attention as a cost‐effective method for hydrogen production, especially when integrated with solar cells. Nonetheless, the progress of such integrated systems is hindered by inadequate water electrolysis efficiency, primarily caused by poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes. To address this issue, a NiFeCo─OOH has developed as an OER electrocatalyst and successfully demonstrated its efficacy in an AEM electrolyzer, which is powered by renewable electricity and integrated with a silicon solar cell.

There is growing acknowledgment that the properties of the electrochemical interfaces play an increasingly pivotal role in improving the performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we present, for the first time, direct dynamic spectral evidence illustrating the impact of the interaction between interfacial water molecules and adsorbed hydroxyl species (OHad) on the HER properties of Ni(OH)2 using Au/core-Ni(OH)2/shell nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Notably, our findings highlight that the interaction between OHad and interfacial water molecules promotes the formation of weakly hydrogen-bonded water, fostering an environment conducive to improving the HER performance. Furthermore, the participation of OHad in the reaction is substantiated by the observed deprotonation step of Au@2 nm Ni(OH)2 during the HER process. This phenomenon is corroborated by the phase transition of Ni(OH)2 to NiO, as verified through Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The significant redshift in the OH-stretching frequency of water molecules during the phase transition confirms that surface OHad disrupts the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water molecules. Through manipulation of the shell thickness of Au@Ni(OH)2, we additionally validate the interaction between OHad and interfacial water molecules. In summary, our insights emphasize the potential of electrochemical interfacial engineering as a potent approach to enhance electrocatalytic performance.

Defect engineering has been widely applied in semiconductors to improve photocatalytic properties by altering the surface structures. This study is about the transformation of inactive WO 3 nanosheets to a highly effective CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion photocatalyst by introducing surface-ordered defects in abundance. The nonstoichiometric WO 3- x samples were examined by using aberration-corrected electron microscopy. Results unveil abundant surface-ordered terminations derived from the periodic {013} stacking faults with a defect density of 20.2%. The {002} surface-ordered line defects are the active sites for fixation CO 2 , transforming the inactive WO 3 nanosheets into a highly active catalyst (CH 4 : O 2 = 8.2: 16.7 μmol h −1 ). We believe that the formation of the W-O-C-W-O species is a critical step in the catalytic pathways. This work provides an atomic-level comprehension of the structural defects of catalysts for activating small molecules.

The quest to identify precious metal free hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts has received unprecedented attention in the past decade. In this Review, we focus our attention to recent developments in precious metal free hydrogen evolution reactions in acidic and alkaline electrolyte owing to their relevance to commercial and near-commercial low-temperature electrolyzers. We provide a detailed review and critical analysis of catalyst activity and stability performance measurements and metrics commonly deployed in the literature, as well as review best practices for experimental measurements (both in half-cell three-electrode configurations and in two-electrode device testing). In particular, we discuss the transition from laboratory-scale hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst measurements to those in single cells, which is a critical aspect crucial for scaling up from laboratory to industrial settings but often overlooked. Furthermore, we review the numerous catalyst design strategies deployed across the precious metal free HER literature. Subsequently, we showcase some of the most commonly investigated families of precious metal free HER catalysts; molybdenum disulfide-based, transition metal phosphides, and transition metal carbides for acidic electrolyte; nickel molybdenum and transition metal phosphides for alkaline. This includes a comprehensive analysis comparing the HER activity between several families of materials highlighting the recent stagnation with regards to enhancing the intrinsic activity of precious metal free hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts. Finally, we summarize future directions and provide recommendations for the field in this area of electrocatalysis.

The design of cost-effective electrocatalysts is an open challenging for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the "stable-or-active" dilemma. Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), a versatile and low-cost material that can be stable under OER operating conditions, exhibits inherently poor OER activity from experimental observations. Herein, we doped a series of metal elements to regulate the ZrO2 catalytic activity in OER via spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with van der Waals interactions. Microkinetic modeling as a function of the OER activity descriptor (GO*-GHO*) displays that 16 metal dopants enable to enhance OER activities over a thermodynamically stable ZrO2 surface, among which Fe and Rh (in the form of single-atom dopant) reach the volcano peak (i.e. the optimal activity of OER under the potential of interest), indicating excellent OER performance. Free energy diagram calculations, density of states, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations further showed that Fe and Rh are the effective dopants for ZrO2, leading to low OER overpotential, high conductivity, and good stability. Considering cost-effectiveness, single-atom Fe doped ZrO2 emerged as the most promising catalyst for OER. This finding offers a valuable perspective and reference for experimental researchers to design cost-effective catalysts for the industrial-scale OER production.

The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is the core component of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which is the place where the reaction occurrence, the multiphase material transfer and the energy conversion, and the development of MEA with high activity and long stability are crucial for the practical application of PEMFCs. Currently, efforts are devoted to developing the regulation of MEA nanostructure engineering, which is believed to have advantages in improving catalyst utilization, maximizing three-phase boundaries, enhancing mass transport, and improving operational stability. This work reviews recent research progress on platinum group metal (PGM) and PGM-free catalysts with multidimensional nanostructures, catalyst layers (CLs), and nano-MEAs for PEMFCs, emphasizing the importance of structure-function relationships, aiming to guide the further development of the performance for PEMFCs. Then the design strategy of the MEA interface is summarized systematically. In addition, the application of in situ and operational characterization techniques to adequately identify current density distributions, hot spots, and water management visualization of MEAs is also discussed. Finally, the limitations of nanostructured MEA research are discussed and future promising research directions are proposed. This paper aims to provide valuable insights into the fundamental science and technical engineering of efficient MEA interfaces for PEMFCs.

In this study, we employ density functional theory to analyze the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of FeTPyP/Au(111) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and their bimetallic-organic counterpart, FeTPyP + Co/Au(111), synthesized via Co atom sublimation. Our investigation focuses on elucidating the mechanistic roles of various metal active sites, thereby establishing a correlation between the local chemical environment and the electronic properties of the active metal centers. We find that the FeTPyP + Co/Au(111) system exhibits sites with a more balanced adsorption behavior for ORR intermediates compared to FeTPyP/Au(111), which leads us to conclude that the former demonstrates enhanced ORR catalytic activity. Additionally, we introduce a methodology for rapid evaluation of the ORR performance based on the electronic structure of the metal active sites.

The development of high-performance and low-cost alkaline hydrogen precipitation catalysts is critical for the large-scale application of hydrogen energy. In this work, the nanoporous alloy catalysts were synthesized by dealloying melt-spun NiZrPt ribbons. The optimal sample after dealloying shows excellent HER performance in alkaline medium, with a small overpotential of 15 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 20 mV/dec. The material characterization reveals that the incorporation of Ni modulates the electronic structure of Pt. After selective dealloying of Zr and Ni, a Pt-enriched nanoporous structure was formed on the catalyst surface. Meanwhile, the remaining Ni sites acted as synergistic sites to activate the Pt sites, which allowed for better hydrogen adsorption energy and faster kinetics of the catalytic reaction. Besides, the favorable mechanical flexibility of the material makes it potential for self-supporting electrode. This work presents a way to prepare low-Pt efficient catalysts by amorphous alloy dealloying.

Hydrogen energy plays an important role in achieving green and low-carbon transformation and development. It is a feasible method to produce clean hydrogen by solar irradiation. In this paper, a new type of InN/BTe van der Waals heterojunction is designed based on density functional theory. The calculated results show that the lattice mismatch of the heterojunction is less than 2% and has good stability, which is beneficial to the experimental synthesis. Under light irradiation, the transfer path of electrons and holes generated by light excitation is Z-scheme mechanism, which accumulates in BTe conduction band and InN valence band with stronger redox activity, respectively, and improves the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrolysis. The InN/BTe heterojunction under the standard hydrogen electrode can achieve complete decomposition of water and spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction. The high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (up to 17.92%) and electron mobility (1820.54 cm2/Vs) indicate that the InN/BTe heterojunction is a promising photocatalytic material.

Abstract A computational screening of Single Atom Catalysts (SACs) bound to titanium nitride (TiN) is presented, for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), based on density functional theory. The role of fundamental ingredients is explored to account for a reliable screening of SACs. Namely, the formation of H 2 ‐complexes besides the classical H * one impacts the predicted HER activity, in line with previous studies on other SACs. Also, the results indicate that one needs to adopt self‐interaction‐corrected functionals. Finally, predicting an active catalyst is of little help without an assessment of its stability. Thus, it is included in the theoretical framework the analysis of the stability of the SACs in working conditions of pH and voltage. Once unconventional intermediates and stability are considered in a self‐interaction corrected scheme, the number of potential good catalysts for HER is strongly reduced since i) some potentially good catalysts are not stable against dissolution and ii) the formation of unconventional intermediates leads to thermodynamic barriers. This study highlights the importance of including ingredients for the prediction of new systems, such as the formation of unconventional intermediates, estimating the stability of SACs, and the adoption of self‐interaction corrected functionals. Also, this study highlights some interesting candidates deserving of dedicated work.

The design of highly efficient and robust non-noble metal water splitting catalysts for hydrogen production is crucial to reduce overpotential and energy consumption. Herein, a strategy for in-situ growth of halogen-doped NiCoP (X-NiCoP/NF, X = F, Cl, and Br) catalysts with special morphology on nickel foam is proposed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the downshift of the d-band center energy can regulate the charge distribution of NiCoP owing to doping of strong electronegativity halogen, thus optimizing the Gibbs free energy of H* absorption (△GH*). The F-NiCoP/NF catalyst achieves remarkable HER activity under alkaline conditions, with overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η10) of 59 mV and Tafel slope of 48.9 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, F-doping significantly increases the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and turnover frequency (TOF), suggestive of the F promotes the formation of highly dispersed high intrinsic active sites. The F-NiCoP/NF exhibits excellent stability with a negligible decrease in activity after durability tests. This work sheds light on the facile synthesis of highly active and stable catalysts with strong electronegative atom doping for HER.

Abstract The rational design of electronic and vacancy structures is crucial to regulating and enhancing electrocatalytic water splitting. However, creating novel vacancies and precisely controlling the number of vacancies in existing materials systems pose significant challenges. Herein, a novel approach to optimize the concentration of the CN vacancy (V CN ) in the NiFe Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanocubes is designed by incorporating the H 2 or O 2 plasma treatment. The relationship between the V CN and catalysis is analyzed, and results show that a moderate concentration of V CN (6.5%) can enormously enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of NiFe PBA. However, an excessive amount of V CN disrupts the crystal structure and hinders the transportation of charge carriers, consequently leading to inferior OER. Furthermore, the V CN significantly activates the activity of Fe sites, inducing preferential adsorption of OH − on Fe sites, followed by adsorption on Ni sites, thereby optimizing the reaction pathway and significantly promoting OER performance. In addition, V CN also suppresses Fe leaching, giving the catalyst excellent durability. This study reveals the feasibility of creating unconventional defects in nanomaterials and precisely controlling the number of vacancies for diverse catalytic and energy applications.

Producing hydrogen through the electrolysis of water is an attractive method for storing intermittent, renewably-generated power in the form of a clean-burning fuel. Amongst the various types of electrolyzer that have been proposed, those employing bipolar membranes have the unique advantage of allowing the water splitting half-reactions to proceed under their ໿kinetically most favourable conditions, thanks to the ability of these membranes to maintain a pH gradient. Maintaining such a pH gradient enables the oxygen evolution reaction to occur in basic conditions whilst the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs in acidic conditions. However, bipolar membrane electrolysis technology remains at an early stage of development and faces several challenges, including high potential losses and low energy efficiency caused by insufficient water transport across (and ion crossover within) the bipolar membrane. In this review, the strategies and methods employed to address these challenges and to enhance the performance and efficiency of bipolar membrane water electrolysis are discussed. The scope of this review is primarily on zero-gap bipolar membrane/interface water electrolyzers, as this configuration is arguably the most relevant bipolar membrane/interface electrolyzer architecture for scaled-up devices and commercial hydrogen production.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), recognized for its considerable potential as a heterogeneous photocatalyst in water splitting, has attracted extensive research interest. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the regulatory role of p-block metal (PM) single atoms on the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 in overall water splitting was systematically explored. The incorporation of PM atoms (Ge, Sn and Pb) led to a reduction in the overpotentials required for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Combined with the electronic structures analysis via hybrid functional, it was found that the introduction of Ge, Sn or Pb optimizes the positions of the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM), providing a robust driving force for HER and ensuring substantial driving force for OER. Meanwhile, the presence of these three PMs induces the spatial separation of VBM and CBM, inhibiting the recombination of carriers. These findings have significant implications for the design and preparation of efficient photocatalysts.

A major challenge in modeling interfacial processes in electrochemical (EC) devices is performing simulations at constant potential. This requires an open-boundary description of the electrons, so that they can enter and leave the computational cell. To enable realistic modeling of EC processes under potential control we have interfaced density functional theory with the hairy probe method in the weak coupling limit (Zauchner et al. Phys. Rev. B 2018, 97, 045116). Our implementation was systematically tested using simple parallel-plate capacitor models with pristine surfaces and a single layer of adsorbed water molecules. Remarkably, our code's efficiency is comparable with a standard DFT calculation. We reveal that local field effects at the electrical double layer induced by the change of applied potential can significantly affect the energies of chemical steps in heterogeneous electrocatalysis. Our results demonstrate the importance of an explicit modeling of the applied potential in a simulation and provide an efficient tool to control this critical parameter.

Quantitative understanding of the chemisorption on single-atom catalysts (SACs) by their electronic properties is crucial for the catalyst design. However, the physical mechanism is still under debate. Here, the CO catalytic oxidation on single transition metal (i.e., Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) dopants is used as a theoretical model to explore the correlations between the characteristics of electronic structures and the chemisorption on SACs. For these metal dopants, their atomic d orbitals form several nondegenerate and localized electronic states that are found to be selectively coupled with the π* orbital of the adsorbed O2, which we defined as selective orbital coupling. Based on the selective orbital coupling, we find that the alignment between the selected d state and the π* state determines the bond strength, regardless of the electron occupation number of the selected d states; the electron transfer to form M–O bonding can be provided by the support. Such electron transfer can be related with the electronic metal–support interaction. We attribute the origin of the chemisorption mechanism to the coexistence of the localized orbital of the single transition metal and the continuous energy band of the Au support. Finally, we illustrate how this mechanism dominates the variation trend of the reaction barriers. Our results unravel a fundamental adsorption mechanism in SAC systems.

FeN4 active sites have been studied as non-Pt group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The authors recently developed Fe(II) 1,14:7,8-ditethenotetrapyrido-[2,1,6-de:2′,1′6′-gh:2″,1″,6″-na][1,3,5,8,10,12] hexaazacyclotetradecine (Fe-14MR) as an FeN4 complex incorporating a 14-membered ring. This complex exhibited higher ORR activity and greater durability than Fe phthalocyanine, a conventional FeN4 complex having a 16-membered ring. In the present study, the ORR activity and durability of this Fe-14MR complex supported on C (Fe-14MR/C) were enhanced through modification of the active site structure by heating at 600 °C and removing protons on amine groups in the Fe-14MR. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Fe-14MR/C structure generated by heating resulted in oxygen species absorption energies close to optimal values for the ORR. The improved durability of the heat-treated Fe-14MR/C was attributed to reduced distortion of the FeN4 sites. The results suggest that designing Fe-14MR structures can be a promising approach to developing non-PGM catalysts.

In CO2RR, enhancing CO adsorption could suppress desorption and increase *CO concentration for deep reduction. An underlying concern is that strong adsorption might result in high thermodynamic barrier for *CO hydrogenation, however, kinetic barrier firstly dominates the reaction pathway and determines the products selectivity. Directed by above idea, CO2RR performance on Mn, Cu doped nitrogenated carbon (MnCu-NC) is comprehensively studied using density functional theory (DFT). MnCu-NC shows a mild limiting potential of -0.59 V (*CO → *CHO) for CH3OH and CH4 products. CO poisoning is likely to cause catalyst deactivation, while CO modified MnCu-NC shows a slightly increased limiting potential of -0.63 V (*COCO → *COCHO) for CH3OH and CH4, and hydrogen evolution is significantly suppressed. Further comparative studies indicate that kinetic barrier for *CO hydrogenation is crucial for deep reduction, and C−O activation, as well as CO adsorption is enhanced by Π-backbonding. Besides, introduction Cu to dual-atom catalyst (DAC) could help retain more electrons and Mn has strong magnetization for charge transfer, both of which improve the charge densities and Π-backbonding strength, thus boosting the remarkable CO2RR performance toward CH4 and CH3OH on MnCu-NC.

The complexity of biological systems and processes, spanning molecular to macroscopic scales, necessitates the use of multiscale simulations to get a comprehensive understanding. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial for capturing processes beyond the reach of classical MD simulations. The advent of exascale computing offers unprecedented opportunities for scientific exploration, not least within life sciences, where simulations are essential to unravel intricate molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. However, leveraging the immense computational power of exascale computing requires innovative algorithms and software designs. In this context, we discuss the current status and future prospects of multiscale biomolecular simulations on exascale supercomputers with a focus on QM/MM MD. We highlight our own efforts in developing a versatile and high-performance multiscale simulation framework with the aim of efficient utilization of state-of-the-art supercomputers. We showcase its application in uncovering complex biological mechanisms and its potential for leveraging exascale computing.

Abstract Efficiently creating a concise but comprehensive data set for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is an under-explored problem. Active learning, which uses biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD-simulation methods, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions—areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. This work demonstrates that MD, when biased by the MLIP’s energy uncertainty, simultaneously captures extrapolative regions and rare events, which is crucial for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. Furthermore, exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD with the concept of bias stress. We employ calibrated gradient-based uncertainties to yield MLIPs with similar or, sometimes, better accuracy than ensemble-based methods at a lower computational cost. Finally, we apply uncertainty-biased MD to alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al), generating MLIPs that represent both configurational spaces more accurately than models trained with conventional MD.

Thermal properties of materials are essential to many applications of thermal electronic devices. Density functional theory (DFT) has shown capability in obtaining an accurate calculation. However, the expensive computational cost limits the application of the DFT method for high-throughput screening of materials. Recently, machine learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated high accuracy in many material properties’ prediction, such as bandgap and formation energy, but fail to accurately predict heat capacity(CV) due to the limitation in capturing crystallographic features. In our study, we have implemented the material informatics transformer (MatInFormer) framework, which has been pretrained on lattice reconstruction tasks. This approach has shown proficiency in capturing essential crystallographic features. By concatenating these features with human-designed descriptors, we achieved a mean absolute error of 4.893 and 4.505 J/(mol K) in our predictions. Our findings underscore the efficacy of the MatInFormer framework in leveraging crystallography, augmented with additional information processing capabilities.
