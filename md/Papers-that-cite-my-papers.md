Alkaline dependence is a common phenomenon in the electrochemical oxidation of biomass, and investigating the influence of alkalinity on the oxidation mechanisms is crucial for enhancing both the activity and the selectivity of biomass oxidation. Herein, we constructed five NiO2Hx catalysts under different alkaline environments (pH ≈ 9–13) and employed density functional theory methods to investigate the reaction mechanisms of the selective oxidation of the biomass platform molecule 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The origin of alkaline dependence in HMF electrochemical oxidation was analyzed, and the results indicate that the catalyst alkalinity determines the oxidation pathway of HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid: under weak alkalinity (pH ≈ 9–11), the adsorption and activation of the alcohol group in HMF are more favorable, resulting in preferential oxidation of the alcohol group; under strong alkalinity (pH ≈ 11–13), the aldehyde group of HMF is more prone to adsorb and activate on the catalyst surface, resulting in a predominant aldehyde oxidation. With the increase in the alkalinity of NiO2Hx, there is a decrease of H atom coverage and an increase in the valence state of Ni, resulting in a transformation in the preferential oxidation pathway of HMF from the alcohol group to the aldehyde group as well as a transition in the oxidation mechanism from direct oxidation to indirect oxidation. NiOOH under moderately alkaline environment effectively reduces the Gibbs free energy change for C–H/O–H bonds cleavage, lowering the reaction energy. It significantly enhances the oxidation ability of alcohol and aldehyde groups, exhibiting the highest catalytic performance in the conversion of HMF to FDCA. The study not only provide a comprehensive explanation for the alkaline dependence of HMF oxidation but also offer guidance on how to rationally design catalysts for improving oxidative performance through alkalinity adjustments.

Abstract Efficient, stable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts are essential to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process during water electrolysis applications. 2D transition metal carbides (MXene) show great potential in functional heterogeneous interface engineering for electrocatalytic OER. However, it is still a challenge to regulate the interlayer space and realize the heterogeneous layer‐by‐layer ordered embedding for MXene. Herein, a simple hydrothermal‐assisted strategy is proposed to prepare highly conductive Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene supported by synergized Ni 2+ , Co 2+ , and Fe 3+ with bilayer H 2 O, which significantly enlarges the interlayer distances and improves the interlayer ion concentrations. Benefiting from modulated interface chemistry, embedded metal ions undergo multi‐directional in situ growth on the MXene substrate, thereby forming a stable 0D/2D@2D nano‐hybrid material (NiFe/MX‐HT). Combining density functional theory calculations with experiments demonstrates that MXene offers a framework for electron transfer, enhances the exposure of active sites, modulates the electronic structure, and greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step in the process of OER. Thus, NiFe/MX‐HT requires only 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 and maintains stability even after operating at 100 mA cm −2 for 150 h. This work offers new insights into exploring various functional MXene‐based heterogeneous materials.

Oxygen evolution catalysis fuels the planet through photosynthesis and is a primary means for hydrogen storage in energy technologies. Yet the detection of intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) central to the catalytic mechanism has been an ongoing challenge. This tutorial and minireview covers the relevance of ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of the electrochemical transformations of a metal-oxide surface undergoing OER. Here, we highlight the ultrafast trigger and probes of the electron-doped SrTiO3/electrolyte as the primary example in which light probes across the electromagnetic spectrum have detected intermediate forms. We compare the results to other early transition-metal-oxide surfaces when they exist for select probes and longer timescales. The first part covers how the catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the semiconducting depletion and electrolyte Helmholtz layers. The second part covers the detection of the intermediates that occur upon electron and proton transfer from an adsorbed water species by transient spectroscopy. Their detection by a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and a coherent acoustic wave respectively targets electronic states, vibrational levels, and lattice strain respectively. One of the aims is a tutorial on how these measurements are made and to what extent they allow for the interpretation of experimental spectra by intermediate configurations predicted by theory. Another aim is to describe what these experiments directly recommend in terms of future efforts to visualize the OER intermediates and their dynamics.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology is seen as the most compatible hydrogen production technology with renewable energy generation. However, the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the scarcity of acid-resistant, high-activity, and low-cost catalysts have seriously hindered the overall efficiency and manufacturing costs of PEMWE. Recently, ruthenium (Ru)-based materials have gradually attracted attention due to their suitable binding strength toward oxygen intermediates and lowest price in the noble metal family. Herein, the great achievements and progress of Ru-based acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively reviewed, which started with a general description of reaction mechanisms and in situ characterization techniques to understand the structure–activity relationships. Subsequently, some typical strategies to enhance the activity and stability of Ru-based electrocatalysts are highlighted. Insights from synthesis methods, advanced characterizations, intermediate evolution, and theoretical calculations are provided, together with our viewpoints on the daunting challenges and future endeavors of Ru-based OER electrocatalysts for their practical employment.

Developing cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable energy applications. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) made from earth-abundant transition metals, thanks to their remarkable stability and electrocatalytic performance, provide a promising alternative to expensive electrocatalysts typically derived from noble metals. While pristine HEA surfaces have been theoretically investigated, and the effect of oxygen coverage on conventional metal electrocatalysts has been examined, the impact of surface oxygen coverage on the electrocatalytic performance of HEAs remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reconstruct the free energy diagram of OER intermediates on CoFeNiCr HEA surfaces with varying oxygen coverages, evaluating their impact on the rate-limiting step and theoretical overpotential. Our findings reveal that increased oxygen coverage weakens the adsorption of HO* and O*, but not HOO*. As a result, the theoretical overpotential for the OER decreases with higher oxygen coverage, and the rate-limiting step shifts from the third oxidation step (HOO* formation) at low coverage to the first oxidation step (HO* formation) at higher coverage.

Addressing the pressing needs for alternatives to fossil fuel-based energy sources, this research explores the intricate interplay between Rhodium (Rh3) clusters and titanium dioxide (TiO2) to improve photocatalytic water splitting for the generation of eco-friendly hydrogen. This research applies the density functional theory (DFT) coupled with the Hartree–Fock theory to meticulously examine the structural and electronic structures of Rh3 clusters on TiO2 (110) interfaces. Considering the photocatalytic capabilities of TiO2 and its inherent limitations in harnessing visible light, the potential for metals such as Rh3 clusters to act as co-catalysts is assessed. The results show that triangular Rh3 clusters demonstrate remarkable stability and efficacy in charge transfer when integrated into rutile TiO2 (110), undergoing oxidation in optimal adsorption conditions and altering the electronic structures of TiO2. The subsequent analysis of TiO2 surfaces exhibiting defects indicates that Rh3 clusters elevate the energy necessary for the formation of an oxygen vacancy, thereby enhancing the stability of the metal oxide. Additionally, the combination of Rh3-cluster adsorption and oxygen-vacancy formation generates polaronic and localized states, crucial for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of metal oxide in the visible light range. Through the DFT analysis, this study elucidates the importance of Rh3 clusters as co-catalysts in TiO2-based photocatalytic frameworks, paving the way for empirical testing and the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for hydrogen production. The elucidated impact on oxygen vacancy formation and electronic structures highlights the complex interplay between Rh3 clusters and TiO2 surfaces, providing insightful guidance for subsequent studies aimed at achieving clean and sustainable energy solutions.

Abstract Structural engineering has proven effective in tailoring the photocatalytic properties of semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, a sophisticated double‐hollow yolk@shell nanostructure composed of a plasmonic, mobile, hollow Au nanosphere (HGN) yolk and a permeable, hollow CdS shell is proposed to achieve remarkable solar hydrogen production. The shell thickness of HGN@CdS is finely adjusted from 7.7, 18.4 to 24.5 nm to investigate its influence on the photocatalytic performance. Compared with pure HGN, pure CdS, a physical mixture of HGN and CdS, and a counterpart single‐hollow cit‐Au@CdS yolk@shell nanostructure, HGN@CdS exhibits superior hydrogen production under visible light illumination (λ = 400–700 nm). The apparent quantum yield of hydrogen production reaches 8.2% at 320 nm, 6.2% at 420 nm, and 4.4% at 660 nm. The plasmon‐enhanced activity at 660 nm is exceptional, surpassing the plasmon‐induced photoactivities of the state‐of‐the‐art plasmonic photocatalysts ever reported. The superiority of HGN@CdS originates from the creation of charge separation state at HGN/CdS heterojunction, the considerably long‐lived hot electrons of plasmonic HGN, the magnified electric field, and the advantageous features of double‐hollow yolk@shell nanostructures. The findings can provide a guideline for the rational design of versatile double‐hollow yolk@shell nanostructures for widespread photocatalytic applications.

The present study investigates the catalytic performance of a hg-C3N4 quantum dot aimed at enhancing electrochemical water splitting using first-principles density functional theory. The size of the considered quantum dot lies within the range reported experimentally (2–4 nm) [Zhou et al. ACS Nano 2015, 9, 12480]. The nitrogen vacancies are created in the considered hg-C3N4 structure to simulate the realistic scenario as the presence of nitrogen and carbon defects is reported in the synthesized hg-C3N4 quantum dots. First, the structural and vibrational properties are computed to ensure the stability of the nitrogen-deficient hg-C3N4 quantum dots, and subsequently, their electronic and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties are investigated. The calculated HER parameters, i.e., adsorption energies, Gibbs free energies, and overpotentials, demonstrate that the considered hg-C3N4 quantum dot with nitrogen vacancies can be used as a moderately effective electrocatalyst for HER performance. We also considered the quantum dot to be dissolved in water and ethanol and find that the overpotential gets drastically reduced to 16 mV for the alcohol-dissolved quantum dot, while some significant reduction is seen for the aqueous solution also. As a result, this study suggests that the nitrogen-deficient hg-C3N4 quantum dots dissolved in ethanol are excellent candidates for catalysis aimed at sustainable hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) shows potential for hydrogen production using cost-effective nonplatinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts, achieving high current density performance. However, challenges remain in developing materials, including stable membranes and ionomers under alkaline conditions and non-PGM catalysts that are both high-performing and durable for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study presents an approach for synthesizing highly crystalline carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticle networks using a polyphenolic tannic acid precursor and non-PGM NiFe metal cores, creating a durable OER catalyst. The simplified synthetic process introduces graphitic carbon layers (GCLs) to encompass the NiFe catalytic nanoparticles. Rigorous testing over 1100 h of continuous current operation demonstrates the stability of the catalysts, which is attributed to the robust interaction between the catalyst and the carbon support. The enhanced durability is further confirmed through theoretical calculations, showing greater resistance to corrosion in graphitic carbon compared to defective carbon. This study highlights the importance of highly crystalline carbon structures for achieving both high performance and durability in OER catalysts, which are vital for cost-effective AEMWE technologies. The findings contribute significantly to understanding the role of regulating carbon crystalline properties in developing efficient and durable non-PGM OER electrocatalysts.

Abstract A machine‐learning‐assisted approach is employed to search for superconducting hydrides under ambient pressure within an extensive dataset comprising over 150 000 compounds. The investigation yields ≈50 systems with transition temperatures surpassing 20 K, and some even reaching above 70 K. These compounds have very different crystal structures, with different dimensionality, chemical composition, stoichiometry, and arrangement of the hydrogens. Interestingly, most of these systems display slight thermodynamic instability, implying that their synthesis will re quire conditions beyond ambient equilibrium. Moreover, a consistent chemical composition is found in the majority of these systems, which combines alkali or alkali‐earth elements with noble metals. This observation suggests a promising avenue for future experimental investigations into high‐temperature superconductivity within hydrides at ambient pressure.

Small Cu clusters are excellent candidates for the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR), and their catalytic performance is expected to be significantly influenced by the interaction between the substrate and cluster. In this study, we systematically investigate the CO2RR for a Cu3 cluster anchored on Janus MoSX (X = Se, Te) substrates using density functional theory calculations. These substrates feature a broken vertical mirror symmetry, which generates spontaneous out-of-plane polarization and offers two distinct polar surfaces to support the Cu3 cluster. Our findings reveal that the CO2RR performance on the Cu3 cluster is strongly influenced by the polarization direction and strength of the MoSX (X = Se, Te) substrates. Notably, the Cu3 cluster supported on the S-terminated MoSTe surface (Cu3(S)@MoSTe) demonstrates the highest CO2RR activity, producing methane. These results underscore the pivotal role of substrate polarization in modulating the binding strength of reactants and reaction intermediates, thereby enhancing the CO2RR efficiency.

The oxygen evolution reaction is the bottleneck to energy-efficient water-based electrolysis for the production of hydrogen and other solar fuels. In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), precious metals have generally been necessary for the stable catalysis of this reaction. In this work, we report that delamination of cobalt tungstate enables high activity and durability through the stabilization of oxide and water-hydroxide networks of the lattice defects in acid. The resulting catalysts achieve lower overpotentials, a current density of 1.8 amperes per square centimeter at 2 volts, and stable operation up to 1 ampere per square centimeter in a PEMWE system at industrial conditions (80°C) at 1.77 volts; a threefold improvement in activity; and stable operation at 1 ampere per square centimeter over the course of 600 hours.

Two-dimensional (2D) polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials have drawn broad attention as promising candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, it remains a significant challenge to simultaneously improve the visible light absorption, separation of photogenerated carriers, and activity. Herein, alkali metals doping PCN (e.g., C6N6 and C2N) are systematically investigated based on density functional theory. Different from the conventional notion of doping atoms as active sites, the actual active site is the intrinsic pyridine nitrogen surrounding the alkali metal. Compared to the change of Gibbs free energy value of −0.45 eV (−0.60 eV) for pristine C6N6 (C2N), Li or Cs doped PCN decreases to −0.03 eV (−0.10 eV) or 0.06 eV (−0.11 eV), respectively, benefitting from the adjustment of the 3p electronic state occupation for N atoms by charges transfer from alkali metal. Meanwhile, Li or Cs doping not only broadens the absorption of visible light by narrowing the band edge position but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes by regulating their spatial separation, which is further confirmed by significant photocurrents for Li or Cs doped PCN based on nonequilibrium Green's function simulation. Our work could provide interesting insights into the mechanistic understanding and the highly efficient design of PCN materials in photocatalysis.

Abstract Non-precious electrocatalysts as the alternative to Pt have become a hot research area in the last decade due to the suitable catalytic activity in Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in electrochemical systems. In this work, the density functional theory calculations were investigated to explore the activity of Fe, Cu, and Fe-Cu atoms supported by N-doped graphene as the ORR electrocatalyst for Oxygen-depolarized cathodes (ODCs). To this end, the ORR mechanism was surveyed in detail in the gas and solvent phases. The results show that the solvent phase leads to a higher overpotential and thermodynamic limiting potential. According to the density of states curves, there are strong interactions between metal atom and substrate that can effectively tune the electronics of catalysts. Bader's analysis confirms that, in addition to the single metal atoms, nitrogen atoms have also played a critical role in charge transfer between substrates and oxygen molecules in ORR. It is also predicted that Fe-Cu@NC SAC exhibits the highest catalytic activity which is consistent with thermodynamic limiting potential and theoretical overpotential of − 0.26 and 0.66 (V vs. SHE), respectively, indicating that this type of catalyst may be a suitable candidate instead of precious metals in oxygen-depolarized cathodes in electrochemical devices.

Abstract Hydrogen (H2) is considered the most promising clean energy source to replace conventional fossil fuels. Despite the exceptional catalytic activity of Pt-group metals, the high cost and relatively low durability of these noble metal-based catalysts remain key bottlenecks for sustainable hydrogen production at the industrial scale. In this report, we synthesized a new type of MXene, tungsten titanium carbide (W2TiC2). By loading cobalt (Co) onto the surface of W2TiC2, we developed a highly effective and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimized catalyst exhibited a small overpotential of 62.58 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a low Tafel slope of 44.34 mV/dec. At high current density of 100 mA/cm2 and 1000 mA/cm2, the low overpotentials of 191.18 mV and 407.72 mV were achieved, significantly outperforming the commercial Pt/C electrode. Under both current ranges, our catalyst exhibited excellent stability of 500 h at 10 mA/cm2 and for 100 h at 1000 mA/cm2 without any obvious degradation. In flow cell tests, by pairing with Ni foam, our catalyst also required much lower cell voltage than commercial Ni foam||Pt/C and maintained ~ 100% H2 faradaic efficiency over the 15h continuous tests from 100 to 400 mA/cm2. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) demonstrated a temperature induced redistribution of Co on MXenes from single sites and large nanoparticles (NPs) to uniform small NPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), revealed that the HER activity was sensitive to the coordination environment of Co on W2TiC2, and the Co-W interface is the likely HER active site . This work sheds light on structure design and utilization of metal-support interaction (MSI) in MXene-supported metal catalysts for the efficient electrochemical water splitting at industrial scale.

Forced by the problems of severe energy crisis, it is urgent to explore high efficiency sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies, particularly for electrolytic water devices and rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The efficiency of these two devices is mainly dominated by the half-reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The design of efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is the key for the development of water splitting and rechargeable ZABs. The antiperovskites as a promising family of electrocatalyst with structure flexibility, high electrical conductivity, and excellent electrocatalytic properties. Defining the enhancement mechanism toward HER, OER, and ORR is an urgent problem for the application of antiperovskite in the electrocatalysis field. This review brief introduces the fundamentals of HER/OER/ORR and summarizes the recent progress of antiperovskite materials in electrocatalysis field, including the research on structural regulation strategies of catalytic properties and catalytic mechanism. Based on ex situ/in situ characterized of electrocatalytic mechanism, the future challenges of antiperovskite in electrocatalytic mechanism and intrinsic modulation were prospected. The basic frontier issues are aimed in the field of HER/OER/ORR to provide theoretical guidance for the development of efficient and economical multifunctional electrocatalysts for ZAB and water splitting.

Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) supported single transition metal (TM) atom (TM1/POM) as an efficient soluble redox mediator for Li–O2 batteries is comprehensively investigated by first-principles calculations. Among the pristine POM and four kinds of TM1/POM (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt), Co1/POM not only maintains good structural and thermodynamic stability in oxidized and reduced states but also exhibits promising electro(chemical) catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li–O2 batteries with the lowest Gibbs free energy barriers. Further investigations demonstrate that the moderate binding strength of Li2-xO2 (x = 0, 1, and 2) intermediates on Co1/POM guarantees favorable Li2O2 formation and decomposition. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the introduced Co single atom as an electron transfer bridge can not only efficiently improve the electronic conductivity of POM but also regulate the bonding/antibonding states around the Fermi level of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox. The solvent effect on the OER catalytic performance and the electronic properties of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox with and without dimethyl sulfoxide solvent are also investigated.

Electrochemical H2 generation and CO2 reduction address the energy and environmental crisis plaguing the world. An efficient electrocatalyst would require the lowest overpotential for these reactions. Given its position on the volcano plot near platinum, palladium presents itself as a viable alternative for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the activity is limited by a high overpotential. It is also a good electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to the favorable position of the d-band center. Nevertheless, the CO poisoning of the active site results in low electrocatalytic stability. Herein, we report a Ni-incorporated palladium catalyst, NiPd, which reduces water to H2 at a very low overpotential of 25 mV (η10). Furthermore, it reduces CO2 to formate with a very high faradaic efficiency of 97% at a potential of −0.25 V (vs RHE). DFT studies show that Ni inclusion leads to the facile activation of CO2 due to a bent adsorption configuration at the catalyst surface. The NiPd catalyst exhibits a strong and stable performance for HER (400 h) as well as for CO2RR (9 h) with high structural integrity as proven by postreaction characterization studies.

Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production via two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ‐ORR) features energy‐saving and eco‐friendly characteristics, making it a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. However, the common existence of numerous 2e − ‐ORR‐inactive sites/species on electrocatalysts tends to catalyze side reactions, especially under low potentials, which compromises energy efficiency and limits H 2 O 2 yield. Addressing this, a high surface density of mono‐species pyrrolic nitrogen configurations is formed over a polypyrrole@carbon nanotube composite. Thermodynamic and kinetic calculation and experimental investigation collaboratively confirm that these densely distributed and highly selective active sites effectively promote high‐rate 2e − ‐ORR electrocatalysis and inhibit side reactions over a wide potential range. Consequently, an ultra‐high and stable H 2 O 2 yield of up to 67.9/51.2 mol g −1 h −1 has been achieved on this material at a current density of 200/120 mA cm −1 , corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 72.8/91.5%. A maximum H 2 O 2 concentration of 13.47 g L −1 can be accumulated at a current density of 80 mA cm −1 with satisfactory stability. The strategy of surface active site densification thus provides a promising and universal avenue toward designing highly active and efficient electrocatalysts for 2e − ‐ORR as well as a series of other similar electrochemical processes.

We explore the phonon transport properties of defect-laden bilayer PtSTe using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on a neural-network force field. Defects prove very efficient at depressing the thermal conductivity of the structure, and flower defects have a particularly powerful effect, comparable to that of double vacancies. Furthermore, the conductivity of the structure with flower defects exhibits an unusual temperature dependence due to structural instability at high temperatures. We look into the distortion to normal modes around the defect by means of the projected phonon density of states and find diverse phenomena including localized modes and blue shifts.

Abstract Renewable energy‐driven proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) attracts widespread attention as a zero‐emission and sustainable technology. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with sluggish OER kinetics and rapid deactivation are major obstacles to the widespread commercialization of PEMWE. To date, although various advanced electrocatalysts have been reported to enhance acidic OER performance, Ru/Ir‐based nanomaterials remain the most promising catalysts for PEMWE applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient, stable, and cost‐effective Ru/Ir catalysts. Since the structure‐performance relationship is one of the most important tools for studying the reaction mechanism and constructing the optimal catalytic system. In this review, the recent research progress from the construction of unsaturated sites to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction and deactivation mechanism of catalysts is summarized. First, a general understanding of OER reaction mechanism, catalyst dissolution mechanism, and active site structure is provided. Then, advances in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER catalysts are reviewed in terms of the classification of unsaturated active site design, i.e., alloy, core‐shell, single‐atom, and framework structures. Finally, challenges and perspectives are presented for the future development of OER catalysts and renewable energy technologies for hydrogen production.

Abstract The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the electrocatalytic deuteration of organics with D 2 O at a large current density is significant for deuterated electrosynthesis. However, the FE and current density are the two ends of a seesaw because of the severe D 2 evolution side reaction at nearly industrial current densities. Herein, we report a combined scenario of a nanotip-enhanced electric field and surfactant-modified interface microenvironment to enable the electrocatalytic deuteration of arylacetonitrile in D 2 O with an 80% FE at −100 mA cm −2 . The increased concentration with low activation energy of arylacetonitrile due to the large electric field along the tips and the accelerated arylacetonitrile transfer and suppressed D 2 evolution by the surfactant-created deuterophobic microenvironment contribute to breaking the trade-off between a high FE and large current density. Furthermore, the application of our strategy in other deuteration reactions with improved Faradaic efficiencies at −100 mA cm −2 rationalizes the design concept.

The development of transition metal-based catalytic platforms that promote bioorthogonal reactions inside living cells remains a major challenge in chemical biology. This is particularly true for palladium-based catalysts, which are very powerful in organic synthesis but perform poorly in the cellular environment, mainly due to their rapid deactivation. We now demonstrate that grafting Pd(II) complexes into engineered β-sheets of a model WW domain results in cell-compatible palladominiproteins that effectively catalyze depropargylation reactions inside HeLa cells. The concave shape of the WW domain β-sheet proved particularly suitable for accommodating the metal center and protecting it from rapid deactivation in the cellular environment. A thorough NMR and computational study confirmed the formation of the metal-stapled peptides and allowed us to propose a three-dimensional structure for this novel metalloprotein motif.

An effective strategy using d-block metal hybridization was proposed to induce electronic interaction and promote the synergistic effect, aiming to enhance the OER performance of cost-effective spinel LiMn2O4. Indeed, we deploy a series of LiNixMn2-xO4 catalysts substituted with Ni, yielding the increase of Mn valence states from Mn3.5+ to Mn4+. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 catalyst achieved an excellent OER performance in alkaline media, with an overpotential reduction more than 320 mV at 10 mA cm-2 compared to the unsubstituted LiMn2O4, as well as the electrochemical stability. It was shown to be superior to most reported Mn-based oxide OER electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that Ni dopes holes in the Mn site, leading to an increase in Mn4+, and that the shared covalent network of Ni 3d-O 2p-Mn 3d optimized an easier desorption of intermediates. These results pave a new example for modulating the chemisorption strength, thus enabling activating the activity and stability of the OER process for cost-effective electrocatalysts based on spinel Mn oxides.

Abstract This work utilizes defect engineering, heterostructure, pyridine N‐doping, and carbon supporting to enhance cobalt‐nickel selenide microspheres' performance in the oxygen electrode reaction. Specifically, microspheres mainly composed of CoNiSe 2 and Co 9 Se 8 heterojunction rich in selenium vacancies (V Se· ) wrapped with nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes (p‐CoNiSe/NCNT@CC) are prepared by Ar/NH 3 radio frequency plasma etching technique. The synthesized p‐CoNiSe/NCNT@CC shows high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance (half‐wave potential (E 1/2 ) = 0.878 V and limiting current density (J L ) = 21.88 mA cm −2 ). The J L exceeds the 20 wt% Pt/C (19.34 mA cm −2 ) and the E 1/2 is close to the 20 wt% Pt/C (0.881 V). It also possesses excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (overpotential of 324 mV@10 mA cm −2 ), which even exceeds that of the commercial RuO 2 (427 mV@10 mA cm −2 ). The density functional theory calculation indicates that the enhancement of ORR performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of plasma‐induced V Se· and the CoNiSe 2 ‐Co 9 Se 8 heterojunction. The p‐CoNiSe/NCNT@CC electrode assembled Zinc‐air batteries (ZABs) show a peak power density of 138.29 mW cm −2 , outperforming the 20 wt% Pt/C+RuO 2 (73.9 mW cm −2 ) and other recently reported catalysts. Furthermore, all‐solid‐state ZAB delivers a high peak power density of 64.83 mW cm −2 and ultra‐robust cycling stability even under bending.

Abstract The size of in situ exsolved nanoparticles (NPs) significantly affects the electrochemical and electro‐catalytic properties of oxide supports. Unfortunately, the instrumental factor affecting the exsolved NP size in poly‐crystalline perovskite oxides is still unexplored. Herein, the inherent micro‐strain (ε) value as an unprecedented factor in controlling the exsolved NP size of Pr 0.5 Ba 0.5‐ x Sr x Fe 0.85 Ni 0.15 O 3‐ δ ( x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) is introduced, wherein smaller NP size is successfully obtained via strain relaxation strategy. The effect of exsolved NP size on the fuel oxidation reaction kinetics at high‐temperature regimes is evaluated in‐depth by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In accordance with the insights provided by DFT calculations, the electro‐catalyst featuring the smallest Fe 3 Ni NP size via strain relaxation strategy demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance along with robust durability toward high‐temperature hydrogen oxidation reaction. This work presents scientific guidance for tailoring the exsolved NP size in perovskites, thereby paving the way for designing rational perovskite electro‐catalysts in various energy‐related applications.

The effective conversion of CO2 to methanol utilizing green hydrogen under moderate conditions represents a promising approach for achieving carbon neutrality. MoS2 demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance at temperatures below 200 °C, however, generating in-plane sulfur defects is challenging due to the intact planar structure. Introducing heteroatoms to induce sulfur vacancy formation and modulate their chemical environment remains a significant obstacle. In this study, we developed a NaCl-assisted method for synthesizing MoS2 and discovered that a small quantity of sodium not only promotes the formation of sulfur vacancies during the induction period, but also encourages CO2 hydrogenation via the carboxylate route, as opposed to the CO2 dissociation to CO* route over non-modified sulfur vacancies. Furthermore, catalysts at various stages throughout the 60 h induction period were characterized, revealing that the increase in sulfur vacancies and enhanced H2 dissociation capability are primary factors contributing to improved methanol yield. The sodium-modified MoS2 achieves a methanol space–time yield of up to 571 mgMeOH gcat−1h−1 at 200 °C and 5 MPa with a 4.8 % CO2 conversion and 96 % methanol selectivity. The turnover frequency based on total sulfur vacancies reaches 170 h−1. This research is anticipated to offer a new strategy for enhancing the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using heteroatom-assisted defect engineering.

Abstract Despite successful use in a wide variety of disciplines for data analysis and prediction, machine learning (ML) methods suffer from a lack of understanding of the reliability of predictions due to the lack of transparency and black-box nature of ML models. In materials science and other fields, typical ML model results include a significant number of low-quality predictions. This problem is known to be particularly acute for target systems which differ significantly from the data used for ML model training. However, to date, a general method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) of ML predictions has not been available. Focusing on the intuitive and computationally efficient similarity-based UQ, we show that a simple metric based on Euclidean feature space distance and sampling density together with the decorrelation of the features using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization allows effective separation of the accurately predicted data points from data points with poor prediction accuracy. To demonstrate the generality of the method, we apply it to light GBM machine learning using a set of time series tabular data sets. We also show that this metric is a more effective UQ tool than the standard approach of using the average distance of k nearest neighbors (k = 1–10) in features space for similarity evaluation. The computational simplicity of this dataset combined with its applicability to time series datasets allows it to be readily used in numerous real world problems.

In industrial production, there are many problems concerning the experimental design of product performance. This kind of problem can be translated into the problem of studying the product performance boundary through binary response modeling. Collecting data through simulation for such experiments is computationally expensive, and conditions and time are limited. Therefore, a sequential experimental design method based on binary response prediction is proposed by collecting as little data as possible to achieve the purpose of the experiment. The initial experimental scheme is generated by the Maximum Projected Coordinate Exchange (MP-CE) algorithm, and the sequential process is combined with the local criterion based on the binary response prediction boundary and the global optimization method for sampling. Example verification results show that the proposed method is superior to random sampling and space-filled sampling. In addition, sensitivity analysis and some algorithm parameters are discussed.
