The electrical double layer (EDL) plays a central role in electrochemical energy systems, impacting charge transfer mechanisms and reaction rates. The fundamental importance of the EDL in interfacial electrochemistry has motivated researchers to develop theoretical and experimental approaches to assess EDL properties. In this contribution, we review recent progress in evaluating EDL characteristics such as the double-layer capacitance, highlighting some discrepancies between theory and experiment and discussing strategies for their reconciliation. We further discuss the merits and challenges of various experimental techniques and theoretical approaches having important implications for aqueous electrocatalysis. A strong emphasis is placed on the substantial impact of the electrode composition and structure and the electrolyte chemistry on the double-layer properties. In addition, we review the effects of temperature and pressure and compare solid-liquid interfaces to solid-solid interfaces.

In computational heterogeneous catalysis, Sabatier's principle-based activity volcano plots provide an intuitive guide to catalyst design but impose a fundamental constraint on the maximum achievable catalytic performance. Recently, subnano clusters have emerged as an exciting platform, offering high noble metal utilization and superior performance for various reactions compared to extended surfaces, reflecting a complex structure-activity relationship in the non-scalable regime. However, understanding their non-monotonic catalytic activity, attributed to the large configurational space and their fluxional identity, poses a formidable challenge. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that captures the non-monotonic trends in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity at the subnanometer scale, attributed to their dynamic fluxional characteristics. We demonstrate a size-dependent shifting and reshaping of the ORR activity volcano, with Au replacing Pt at the peak. Leveraging only upon the non-

Electrochemical methods for nitrogen reduction have received extensive attention due to the mild reaction conditions. In order to gain an insight into the mechanism of the electrochemical nitrogen reduction process, theoretical simulations are necessary. However, current simulation studies contain many imprecise approximations that may hinder the real recognition of the reaction process. Although solvation methods have recently been developed to provide efficient descriptions, their further applications are hindered by controversy over modeling of solvents and the enormous computational effort required. In this work, we simplify the solvation conditions by using water clusters and compare them with an accurate water layer model. The results demonstrate that the simplified water clusters can effectively capture protons, simulate the surface electric environment, and enable the calculation of the activation energy of the reaction. This method offers an affordable approach for simulating the surface potentials and solvents and provides a new reference for the theoretical study of the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction.

Abstract Nonprecious metal‐based 2D materials have shown promising electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the catalytically active sites of 2D materials are mainly presented at the edge, and most of their basal planes are still catalytically inactive, which turns into a significant drawback on the catalytic efficiency. Here, a novel p–n heterojunction strategy is suggested that generates active sites on the basal plane of 2D NiFe‐layered double hydroxide (NiFe‐LDH). The n‐type NiFe‐LDH is first grown on a nickel foam (NF) substrate, and p‐type Co 3 O 4 nanocubes are deposited through a simple dip‐coating method to fabricate a Co 3 O 4 /NiFe‐LDH@NF p–n heterojunction electrode. As a result, electron transfer is induced at the interface of p‐type Co 3 O 4 and n‐type NiFe‐LDH, which consequently promotes oxidation of the inert Ni 2+ state to a more catalytically active Ni 3+ state on the inert basal plane of NiFe‐LDH. As‐prepared Co 3 O 4 /NiFe‐LDH@NF electrodes obtained enhanced OER performance showing a high current density of 100 mA cm −2 at 1.48 V (vs RHE) which outperforms that of pristine NiFe‐LDH@NF. The utilization of the p–n junction concept will disclose a new strategy for modifying the electronic structure of the catalytically inactive basal plane and stimulating its electrocatalytic activity.

Abstract Doping guest elements is an effective way to increase activity and stability of RuO2 catalysts in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, due to the vastness of doping space, it is challenging for either high-cost experiments or density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen out the doped structures with the optimized catalytic performance. Herein, we reported a machine-learning (ML) framework that aims to realize high-throughput screening for both stability and activity of doped-RuO2 acidic OER catalysts from mono-doping to triple-doping at a low level of computational cost. Compared to the d-band theory and some other previous models, our ML model was constructed based on more general input features and realized higher prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.074, 0.142 and 0.082 eV for *OH, *O and *OOH adsorption, respectively. Through the ML models, three doping structures, Ru41Zn7O96, Ru41Zn4Fe3O96, and Ru39Zn4Cu4Co1O96 were found to possess the extraordinarily high stability and comparable or higher activity than the previously reported OER catalysts. This work provided an efficient study paradigm in fields of material screening and a useful guide for experimental synthesis.

Geometry optimization is an important tool used for computational simulations in the fields of chemistry, physics, and material science. Developing more efficient and reliable algorithms to reduce the number of force evaluations would lead to accelerated computational modeling and materials discovery. Here, we present a delta method-based neural network-density functional theory (DFT) hybrid optimizer to improve the computational efficiency of geometry optimization. Compared to previous active learning approaches, our algorithm adds two key features: a modified delta method incorporating force information to enhance efficiency in uncertainty estimation, and a quasi-Newton approach based upon a Hessian matrix calculated from the neural network; the later improving stability of optimization near critical points. We benchmarked our optimizer against commonly used optimization algorithms using systems including bulk metal, metal surface, metal hydride, and an oxide cluster. The results demonstrate that our optimizer effectively reduces the number of DFT force calls by 2-3 times in all test systems.

Defect engineering in the inherently inert basal planes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), involving the introduction of chalcogen vacancies, represents a pivotal approach to enhance catalytic activity by exposing high-density catalytic metal single-atom sites. However, achieving a single-atom limit spacing between chalcogen vacancies to form ordered superstructures remains challenging for creating uniformly distributed high-density metal single-atom sites on TMDs comparable to carbon-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here we unveil an efficient TMD-based topological catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), featuring high-density single-atom reactive centers on a few-layer (7 × 7)-PtTe

Accurate knowledge of the properties of hydrogen at high compression is crucial for astrophysics (e.g., planetary and stellar interiors, brown dwarfs, atmosphere of compact stars) and laboratory experiments, including inertial confinement fusion. There exists experimental data for the equation of state, conductivity, and Thomson scattering spectra. However, the analysis of the measurements at extreme pressures and temperatures typically involves additional model assumptions, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the experimental data rigorously. On the other hand, theory and modeling have produced extensive collections of data. They originate from a very large variety of models and simulations including path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations, density functional theory (DFT), chemical models, machine-learned models, and combinations thereof. At the same time, each of these methods has fundamental limitations (fermion sign problem in PIMC, approximate exchange–correlation functionals of DFT, inconsistent interaction energy contributions in chemical models, etc.), so for some parameter ranges accurate predictions are difficult. Recently, a number of breakthroughs in first principles PIMC as well as in DFT simulations were achieved which are discussed in this review. Here we use these results to benchmark different simulation methods. We present an update of the hydrogen phase diagram at high pressures, the expected phase transitions, and thermodynamic properties including the equation of state and momentum distribution. Furthermore, we discuss available dynamic results for warm dense hydrogen, including the conductivity, dynamic structure factor, plasmon dispersion, imaginary-time structure, and density response functions. We conclude by outlining strategies to combine different simulations to achieve accurate theoretical predictions that are based on first principles.

Hydrogen has the potential to decarbonize the energy and industrial sectors in the future, mainly if it is generated by water electrolysis. The proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) system is regarded as a propitious technology to produce green hydrogen from water using power supplied by renewable energy sources. It offers many benefits, such as high performance, high proton conductibility, quick response, compact size, and low working temperature. Many conceptual and functional parameters influence the effectiveness of PEM, including temperature, pressure of anode and cathode regions, water content and wideness of the layer, and cathode and anode exchange current density. In addition, the anodic half-reaction (known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) and cathodic half-reaction (known as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) perform an important function in the development of PEMWE. The current study aims to present these parameters and discuss their impacts on the performance of PEM. Also, the PEM efficiency is presented. The different methods used to enhance the scattering of OER electrocatalysts and minimize catalyst loading to minimize the price of PEMWE are also highlighted. Moreover, the alternative noble metals that could be used as electrocatalysts in HER and OER to minimize the cost of PEM are reviewed and presented.

Graphitic phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4, abbreviated as CN) can be used as a photocatalyst to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, there is still potential for improvement in the small band gap and carrier migration properties of intrinsic materials. K-B co-doped CN (KBCN) was investigated as a promising photocatalyst for carbon dioxide reduction via the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. The electronic and optical properties of CN and KBCN indicate that doping K and B can improve the catalytic performance of CN by promoting charge migration and separation. In terms of the Gibbs free energy change, the CO2 reduction reaction catalysed by KBCN results in CH3OH, and its optimal pathway is CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → CO → *OCH → HCHO → *OCH3 → CH3OH. Compared with CN, the doping elements K and B shift the rate-determining step from CO2 → *CO2 to *CO2 → *COOH. The K and B elements co-doping tuned the charge distribution between the catalyst and the adsorbate and reduced the Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining step from 1.571 to 0.861 eV, suggesting that the CO2 reduction activity of KBCN is superior to that of CN. Our work provides useful insights for the design of metallic–nonmetallic co-doped CN for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2PR) reactions.

The thermodynamic features and mechanism of the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction were studied using the revPBE0-D3(BJ)/Def2-TZVP method on the example of (6,6)-armchair carbon nanotube doped with a tricoordinated silicon atom and nitrogen atoms of pyridinic and graphitic nature. Irreversible oxidation of the silicon center as a result of the formation of stable oxygen-containing adsorbates was shown. It was found that Si-poisoned structures are capable of participating in the catalysis of the target reaction along two- and four-electron routes at high overpotentials. For a nanotube doped simultaneously with pyridinic and graphitic nitrogens the potential possibility of eliminating the silicon atom from the catalyst composition in the form of orthosilicic acid and the participation of a silicon-free nitrogen-doped framework in the oxygen electroreduction reaction, for which the stage of tautomerization of pyridin-2(1H)-one to pyridin-2-ol is the limiting step was shown.

Abstract We develop an automated high-throughput workflow for calculating lattice dynamical properties from first principles including those dictated by anharmonicity. The pipeline automatically computes interatomic force constants (IFCs) up to 4th order from perturbed training supercells, and uses the IFCs to calculate lattice thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and vibrational free energy and entropy. It performs phonon renormalization for dynamically unstable compounds to obtain real effective phonon spectra at finite temperatures and calculates the associated free energy corrections. The methods and parameters are chosen to balance computational efficiency and result accuracy, assessed through convergence testing and comparisons with experimental measurements. Deployment of this workflow at a large scale would facilitate materials discovery efforts toward functionalities including thermoelectrics, contact materials, ferroelectrics, aerospace components, as well as general phase diagram construction.

Abstract The combination of different elements in alloy catalysts can lead to improved activity as it provides opportunities to tune the electronic structures of surface atoms. However, the synthesis and performance screening of alloy catalysts through a vast chemical space are cost‐ and labor‐intensive. Herein, a UV‐induced, high‐throughput method is reported for the synthesis and screening of alloy electrocatalysts in a fast and low‐cost manner. A platform that integrates 37 mini‐reaction‐cells enables simultaneous UV‐induced photodeposition of alloy nanoparticles with up to 37 compositions. These mini‐reaction‐cells further allow a transfer‐free, high‐throughput electrochemical performance screening. Binary (PtPd, PtIr, PdIr), ternary (PtPdIr, PtRuIr) and quaternary (PtPdRuIr) alloys have been synthesized with the activity of the binary alloys (57 compositions) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) being screened. The predicted high performance of identified alloy compositions are subsequently validated by standard measurements using a rotating disk electrode configuration. It is found that the as‐synthesized alloy nanoparticles are rich in twin boundaries and thus possess lattice strain. Density functional theory calculation implies that the high ORR activity of the screened Pt 0.75 Pd 0.25 alloy originates from the interplay between the differentiated adsorption sites because of alloying and the strain‐induced modulation of the d‐band center.

Abstract Engineering metal‐oxygen (M‒O) interactions for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by tuning the coordination geometry of metal sites is crucial for improving catalytic performance, which remains unexplored, especially in structurally diverse phosphate‐based catalysts. Herein, two NaCoPO 4 (NCP) polymorphs with distinct metal coordinations: orthorhombic‐ Pnma (CoO 6 ) and hexagonal‐P 6 5 (CoO 4 ) denoted as O‐NCP and H‐NCP, respectively are synthesized through unique quenching‐based synthesis, to investigate the impact of coordination geometry on M‒O covalency and OER performance. The CoO 4 (H‐NCP) polymorph delivered superior OER activity with low overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 (η 10 = 303 mV) and long‐term stability than CoO 6 ‐based O‐NCP. Spectroscopic and computational studies linked the superior activity of CoO 4 to higher Co‒O covalency, enhanced metal electronic states near the Fermi level, and improved electrochemical reconstruction. Further, M‒O covalency regulated OER mechanism, where high‐covalent CoO 4 follows conventional concerted proton‐electron transfer pathway, while CoO 6 entails a non‐concerted pathway, where the lattice oxygen participation remains unfavorable due to downshifted O 2p band center. Further, OER‐active tetrahedral metal is demonstrated in a high‐entropy catalyst requiring lower η 10 of ≈284 mV. This study unlocks a unique strategy for designing next‐generation OER catalysts with superior activity and durability, harnessing the interplay between metal coordination and metal‐oxygen covalency.

Prevalent electrolyte effects across a wide range of electrocatalytic reactions underscore the general importance of the local reaction conditions in the electrical double layer (EDL). Compared to traditional EDLs, the electrocatalytic siblings feature partially charged chemisorbates that could blur our long-held views of surface charge densities and differential capacitances—two interrelated quantities shaping the crucial local reaction conditions. Herein, five variants of surface charge density and three variants of differential capacitance in the presence of chemisorbates are defined and compared. A semiclassical model of electrocatalytic EDLs is developed for a quantitative analysis of the differences and interrelationships between these variants of surface charge densities and differential capacitances. It is revealed that the potential- and concentration-dependent net charge on these chemisorbates dramatically changes the surface charge densities and differential capacitances. Specifically, the free surface charge density could decrease as the electrode potential becomes more positive, implying that the . The relationship between the free and total surface charge densities is analyzed with aid of the concept of electrosorption valency. By linking the electrosorption valency with the differential capacitance in the absence of chemisorbates, we explain the potential and concentration dependence of the former. The conceptual analysis presented in this work has important implications for experimental characterization and first-principles-based atomistic simulations of electrocatalysis and EDL effects. Particularly, we disclose a hidden yet potentially crucial disadvantage of widely employed atomistic simulation models that fix the coverage of chemisorbates. Proposing the self-consistent implicit model as an expedient remedy for this disadvantage, this work contributes to more realistic modeling of electrocatalytic EDLs.

Abstract Transition metal borides (TMBs) are a new class of promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation by water splitting. However, the synthesis of robust all‐in‐one electrodes is challenging for practical applications. Herein, a facile solid‐state boronization strategy is reported to synthesize a series of self‐supported TMBs thin films (TMB‐TFs) with large area and high catalytic activity. Among them, MoB thin film (MoB‐TF) exhibits the highest activity toward electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), displaying a low overpotential ( η 10 = 191 and 219 mV at 10 mA cm −2 ) and a small Tafel slope (60.25 and 61.91 mV dec −1 ) in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, it outperforms the commercial Pt/C at the high current density region, demonstrating potential applications in industrially electrochemical water splitting. Theoretical study reveals that both surfaces terminated by TM and B atoms can serve as the active sites and the H* binding strength of TMBs is correlated with the p band center of B atoms. This work provides a new pathway for the potential application of TMBs in large‐scale hydrogen production.

With the increasing global emphasis on green energy and sustainable development goals, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually becoming a crucial focus in research on water oxidation for hydrogen generation. However, its complicated reaction processes associated with its high energy barrier severely limit the efficiency of energy conversion. Recently, layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been considered as one of the most promising catalysts in alkaline media. Nonetheless, lacking a deep insight into the kinetic process of the electrocatalytic OER process is detrimental to the further optimization of LDH catalysts. Therefore, monitoring the catalytic reaction kinetic process via surface-sensitive in situ spectroscopy is especially important. In particular, the in situ Raman technique is capable of providing fingerprint information for surface species and intermediates in the operating environment. From the perspective of Raman spectroscopy, this paper provides an exhaustive overview of research progress in in situ Raman for the characterization of the catalytic mechanism of LDH catalysts, providing theoretical guidance for designing LDH materials. Finally, we present an incisive discussion on the challenges of the electrocatalytic in situ Raman technique and its future development trend.

## Cu-Supported ZnO under Conditions of CO2 Reduction to Methanol: Why 0.2 ML Coverage?

By hydrogenating carbon dioxide to value-added products such as methanol, heterogeneous catalysts can lower greenhouse gas emissions and generate alternative liquid fuels. The most common commercial catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to methanol is Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, where ZnO improves conversion and selectivity toward methanol. The structure of this catalyst is thought to be Zn oxy(hydroxyl) overlayers on the nanometer scale on Cu. In the presence of CO2 and H2 under reaction conditions, the Cu substrate itself can be restructured and/or partially oxidized at its interface with ZnO, or the Zn might be reduced, possibly completely to a CuZn alloy, making the exact structure and stoichiometry of the active site a topic of active debate. In this study, we examine Zn3 clusters on Cu(100) and Cu(111), as a subnano model of the catalyst. We use a grand canonical genetic algorithm to sample the system structure and stoichiometry under catalytic conditions: T of 550 K, initial partial pressures of H2 of 4.5 atm and CO2 of 0.5 atm, and 1% conversion. We uncover a strong dependence of the catalyst stoichiometry on the surface coverage. At the optimal 0.2 ML surface coverage, chains of Zn(OH) form on both Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), the catalyst has many thermally accessible metastable minima, whereas on Cu(111), it does not. No oxidation or reconstruction of the Cu is found. However, at a lower coverage of Zn, Zn3 clusters take on a metallic form on Cu(100), and slightly oxidized Zn3O on Cu(111), while the surface uptakes H to form a variety of low hydrides of Cu. We thus hypothesize that the 0.2 ML Zn coverage is optimal, as found experimentally, because of the stronger yet incomplete oxidation afforded by Zn at this coverage.

Abstract We present a comprehensive and user-friendly framework built upon the integrated development environment (IDE), enabling researchers to perform the entire Machine Learning Potential (MLP) development cycle consisting of (i) creating systematic DFT databases, (ii) fitting the Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to empirical potentials or MLPs, and (iii) validating the potentials in a largely automatic approach. The power and performance of this framework are demonstrated for three conceptually very different classes of interatomic potentials: an empirical potential (embedded atom method - EAM), neural networks (high-dimensional neural network potentials - HDNNP) and expansions in basis sets (atomic cluster expansion - ACE). As an advanced example for validation and application, we show the computation of a binary composition-temperature phase diagram for Al-Li, a technologically important lightweight alloy system with applications in the aerospace industry.

The advancement of acid-stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for efficient hydrogen production through proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Unfortunately, the activity of electrocatalysts is constrained by a linear scaling relationship in the adsorbed evolution mechanism, while the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism undermines stability. Here, we propose a heterogeneous dual-site oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) that avoids these limitations through direct dioxygen radical coupling.
