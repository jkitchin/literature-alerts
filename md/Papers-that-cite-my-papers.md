Abstract Integration of different active sites by heterostructure engineering is pivotal to optimize the intrinsic activities of an oxygen electrocatalyst and much needed to enhance the performance of rechargeable Zn–air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a biphasic nanoarchitecture encased in in situ grown N‐doped graphitic carbon (MnO/Co‐NGC) with heterointerfacial sites are constructed. The density functional theory model reveals formation of lattice oxygen bridged heterostructure with pyridinic nitrogen atoms anchored Co species, which facilitate adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Consequently, the well‐designed catalyst with accessible active sites, abundant oxygen vacant sites, and heterointerfacial coupling effects, simultaneously accelerate the electron/mass transfer and thus promotes the trifunctional electrocatalysis. The assembled aqueous ZAB delivers maximum power density of ≈268 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 797.8 mAh g zn −1 along with excellent rechargeability and extremely small voltage gap decay rate of 0.0007 V h −1 . Further, the fabricated quasisolid‐state ZAB owns a remarkable power density of 163 mW cm −2 and long cycle life, outperforming the benchmark air‐electrode and many recent reports, underlining its robustness and suitability for practical utilization in diverse portable applications.

In area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD), small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) play a critical role in directing surface selectivity, preventing unwanted deposition on non-growth surfaces, and enabling precise thin-film formation essential for semiconductor and advanced manufacturing processes. This study utilizes grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to investigate the competitive adsorption characteristics of three SMIs─aniline, 3-hexyne, and propanethiol (PT)─alongside trimethylaluminum (TMA) precursors on a Cu(111) surface. Single-component adsorption analyses reveal that aniline attains the highest coverage among the SMIs, attributed to its strong interaction with the Cu surface; however, this coverage decreases by approximately 42% in the presence of TMA, underscoring its susceptibility to competitive adsorption effects. By contrast, 3-hexyne displays minimal alteration in adsorption when it is in competition with TMA, effectively inhibiting TMA adsorption and indicating its suitability as a robust SMI for AS-ALD. PT also demonstrates moderate inhibitory capability against TMA, although it is less effective than 3-hexyne in this regard. These findings highlight the importance of intermolecular forces and adsorption energies in determining SMI effectiveness in blocking TMA on non-growth surfaces. Mechanistic insights from this study reveal the nuanced influence of specific SMI–precursor interactions, emphasizing the necessity of selecting SMIs tailored to precursor characteristics and surface interactions. This work provides essential contributions to the rational design of SMIs in AS-ALD, with implications for improving deposition precision and optimizing AS-ALD parameters in nanomanufacturing applications.

Abstract Designing cost‐effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge in green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two OWS half‐cell reactions. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesiz hierarchical heterostructure MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH and MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low IR‐corrected overpotentials of 156 and 61 mV with at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 under light assistance. The MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH‐MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH OWS cell achieves a low cell voltage of 1.46V at 10 mA cm −2 during light‐assisted water electrolysis. Both materials exhibited exceptional stability under industrially relevant HER and OER conditions, maintaining a current density of 1 A cm −2 with minimal alterations in their potential and performance. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping the LDH matrix with high‐valence Mo atoms and MoS 2 quantum dots improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the electrocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the thermodynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, this work develops a facile synthesis method to design highly active and stable MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.

Three different cathodic materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) consisting of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) supported onto a bare and two doped reduced graphene oxides (r-GO) have been studied. Ru NPs have been synthesized in situ by means of the organometallic approach in the presence of each reduced graphene support (bare (rGO), N-doped (NH2-rGO) and P-doped (P-rGO)). (HR)TEM, EDX, EA, ICP-OES, XPS, Raman and NMR techniques have been used to fully characterize the obtained rGO-supported Ru materials. These materials have been deposited onto a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (GC-RDE) to assess their HER electrocatalytic activity at acidic pH. The results show that all three materials are stable under reductive conditions for at least 12 h, and that the heteroatom-doping of the graphene structure extremely increases the activity of the electrodes, especially for the case of Ru@P-rGO, where the overpotential at −10 mA·cm–2 decreases to only 2 mV. Realistic (based on experimental compositional data) modeling of the three rGO supports combined with DFT computational analysis of the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of the hybrid nanocatalysts allows attributing the observed electrocatalytic performances to a combination of interrelated factors such as the distance of the Ru atoms to the dopped rGO support and the hydride content at the Ru NP surface.

An ideal water-splitting electrocatalyst is inexpensive, abundant, highly active, stable, selective, and durable. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the main bottleneck for H2 production with a complex and not fully resolved mechanism, slow kinetics, and high overpotential. Nickel oxide-based catalysts (NiOx) are highly active and cheaper than precious metal catalysts. However, rigorous catalyst tests and DFT calculations are still needed to rationally optimize NiOx catalysts. In this work, we combine plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) and density functional theory (DFT) to address the role of dopants in promoting NiOx OER activity. Ultrathin films of NiOx doped with Zn2+, Al3+, and Sn4+ presented improved intrinsic activity, stability, and durability for the OER. The results show a low to high catalytic performance of ZnNiOx < NiOx < AlNiOx < SnNiOx, which we attribute to an increase in the concentration of valence band (VB) holes combined with conduction band (CB) electron conductivity, characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of doping on the electronic structure and catalytic activity was investigated using advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (PEB0/pob-TZVP). DFT complements the experimental results, showing that the dopant charge states and orbital hybridization enhance the OER by improving the charge carrier concentration and mobility, thus allowing optimal binding energies and charge dynamics and delocalization. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PE-ALD-doped nanofilms NiOx and DFT to rationally design and develop catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

The versatile optoelectronic properties of the material class of III–V semiconductors enable the highest performance in photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical solar cells. While a high level of control and understanding with respect to different surface reconstructions of these compounds in gas-phase ambient has been reached, the situation in an electrochemical environment still poses challenges. Here, we therefore have undertaken a computational study of the InP(100) surface in the presence of hydrogen and chlorine, mimicking the contact with a hydrochloric acid-containing electrolyte, aiming at an understanding of ion adsorption and dominant surface reconstructions with respect to applied potential and electrolyte concentration. For this purpose, the most stable surface terminations for hydrogen and chlorine (co)adsorption from the gas phase as well as the corresponding phase diagrams have been determined with respect to the hydrogen and chlorine chemical potential. In this context, we also introduce a quantitative type of phase diagram to highlight the stability of surface phases with respect to competing structures. Finally, by making use of the computational hydrogen electrode approach, these results were then transferred to the potential domain. We find that hydrogen (chlorine) adsorption is dominating at more (less) cathodic potentials, while coadsorption is limited to small fractions of the phase space. This allows us to determine experimentally accessible phases for which no detrimental effects, such as the creation of in-gap surface states, are to be expected.

Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are one of the ideal energy conversion devices. However, platinum (Pt), as the benchmark catalyst for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) of AEMFCs anodes, still faces issues of insufficient performance and susceptibility to CO poisoning. Here, we report the Joule heating-assisted synthesis of a small sized Ru1Pt single-atom alloy catalyst loaded on nitrogen-doped carbon modified with single W atoms (s-Ru1Pt@W1/NC), in which the near-range single Ru atoms on the Ru1Pt nanoparticles and the long-range single W atoms on the support simultaneously modulate the electronic structure of the active Pt-site, enhancing alkaline HOR performance of s-Ru1Pt@W1/NC. The mass activity of s-Ru1Pt@W1/NC is 7.54 A mgPt+Ru-1 and exhibits notable stability in 1000 ppm CO/H2-saturated electrolyte. Surprisingly, it can operate stably in H2-saturated electrolyte for 1000 h with only 24.60 % decay. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the proximal single Ru atoms and the remote single W atoms synergistically optimize the electronic structure of the active Pt-site, improving the HOR activity and CO tolerance of the catalyst. The development of anode catalysts for anion-exchange membrane fuel cells is promising but challenging in practical applications. Here, the authors report the tiny single-atom alloy nanoparticles that catalyze hydrogen oxidation reaction with very high activity, stability, and CO resistance.

Atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs) are promising building blocks for designing materials and interfaces with unique properties. By incorporating heteroatoms into the core, the electronic and magnetic properties of NCs can be precisely tuned. To accurately predict these properties, density functional theory (DFT) is often employed, making the rigorous benchmarking of DFT results particularly important. In this study, we present a benchmarking approach based on metal chalcogenide NCs as a model system. We synthesized a series of bimetallic, iron–cobalt chalcogenide NCs [Co6–xFexS8(PEt3)6]+ (x = 0–6) (PEt = triethyl phosphine) and investigated the effect of heteroatoms in the octahedral metal chalcogenide core on their size and electronic properties. Using ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS), we observed a gradual increase in the collision cross section (CCS) with an increase in the number of Fe atoms in the core. DFT calculations combined with trajectory method CCS simulations successfully reproduced this trend, revealing that the increase in cluster size is primarily due to changes in metal–ligand bond lengths, while the electronic properties of the core remain largely unchanged. Moreover, this method allowed us to exclude certain multiplicity states of the NCs, as their CCS values were significantly different from those predicted for the lowest-energy structures. This study demonstrates that gas-phase IM-MS is a powerful technique for detecting subtle size differences in atomically precise NCs, which are often challenging to observe using conventional NC characterization methods. Accurate CCS measurements are established as a benchmark for comparison with theoretical calculations. The excellent correspondence between experimental data and theoretical predictions establishes a robust foundation for investigating structural changes of transition metal NCs of interest to a broad range of applications.

We conducted a theoretical and experimental study on the electro-oxidation of methanol (MOR) on NixPdy nanoparticles. The results are presented in terms of kinetic parameters, surface concentrations, and peak currents, showing significant differences between three main compositions: Ni3Pd1, Ni1Pd1, and Ni1Pd3. The kinetic mechanism adopted for accounting the linear voltammetry experiments performed follows the carbonate–palladium oxide pathway of the MOR. Numerical simulations of the kinetic equations, fitted to experimental data obtained at varying methanol concentrations, allowed us to distinguish the adsorption contributions of methanol, water, and OH ions from the nonlinear contribution associated with palladium oxide and carbon dioxide production. The synergistic effects of Ni:Pd nanoalloys on the MOR were then assessed by analyzing the behavior and tendencies of the reaction rate constants for different bulk methanol concentrations. Our results suggest that a higher Pd content favors more efficient oxidation mechanisms by reducing the formation of intermediate products that cause surface poisoning, such as CO, carbonates, or palladium oxide. However, as the proportion of Ni increases, an increase in the concentration of adsorbed OH is observed, which dominates the blocking of active sites even greater than the palladium oxide blocking.

A multiscale quantum mechanical (QM)/classical approach is presented that is able to model the optical properties of complex nanostructures composed of a molecular system adsorbed on metal nanoparticles. The latter is described by a combined atomistic–continuum model, where the core is described using the implicit boundary element method (BEM) and the surface retains a fully atomistic picture and is treated employing the frequency-dependent fluctuating charge and fluctuating dipole (ωFQFμ) approach. The integrated QM/ωFQFμ-BEM model is numerically compared with state-of-the-art fully atomistic approaches, and the quality of the continuum/core partition is evaluated. The method is then extended to compute surface-enhanced Raman scattering within a time-dependent density functional theory framework.

Abstract Nickel‐based double perovskites AA′BB′O 6 are an underexplored class of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, in which B‐site substitution is used to tune electronic and structural properties. BaSrNiWO 6 , with a B‐site comprised of alternating Ni and W, exhibits high oxygen evolution activity, attributed to the evolution of a highly OER active surface phase. The redox transformation of Ni 2+ (3d 8 ) to Ni 3+ (3d 7 ) combined with partial W dissolution into the electrolyte from the linear Ni(3d)‐O(2p)‐W(5d) chains drives an in situ reconstruction of the surface to an amorphized, NiO‐like layer, promoting oxygen redox in the OER mechanism. However, the high valence W 6+ (5d 0 ) acts as a stabilizing electronic influence in the bulk, preventing the mobilization of lattice oxygen which is bound in highly covalent W─O bonds. It is proposed that the surface generated during the OER can support a lattice oxygen evolution mechanism (LOEM) in which oxygen vacancies are created and preferentially refilled by electrolytic OH − , while bulk O species remain stable. This surface LOEM (sLOEM) allows BaSrNiWO 6 to retain structural integrity during OER catalysis. With a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec −1 in 0.1 m KOH, BaSrNiWO 6 illustrates the potential of Ni‐based double perovskites to offer both OER efficiency and bulk stability in alkaline electrolysis.

Due to the high configuration entropy, unique atomic arrangement, and electronic structures, high-entropy materials are being actively pursued as bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). However, a relevant strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of high-entropy materials is still lacking. Herein, a hole doping strategy has been employed to enable the high-entropy perovskite La(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 to effectively catalyze the ORR and OER. Hole doping experiments rely on the substitution of Sr2+ for La3+. The optimized La0.7Sr0.3(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 displays remarkable activity for the ORR and the OER, with a low potential difference of 0.880 V between the half-wave potential of the ORR and the OER potential at 10 mA cm-2, exceeding the majority of perovskite bifunctional catalysts. Further analysis of the electronic structures reveals that hole doping could regulate the eg-orbital filling of the transition-metal cations in high-entropy perovskites to an ideal position and thereby generate many highly active sites to promote the redox activity of oxygen. The assembled rechargeable ZAB with the targeted high-entropy perovskite as the cathode affords a specific capacity of 774.5 mAh gZn-1 under 10 mA cm-2 and durability for a period of 300 cycles, comparable to that of the 20%Pt/C + RuO2 ZAB. This work offers an important approach for the advancement of efficient high-entropy perovskites for ZABs.

We carry out highly accurate path integral Monte Carlo simulations to directly estimate the free energy of various warm dense matter systems including the uniform electron gas and hydrogen without any nodal restrictions or other approximations. Since our approach is based on an effective ensemble in a bosonic configuration space, it does not increase the computational complexity beyond the usual fermion sign problem. Its application to inhomogeneous cases such as an electronic system in a fixed external ion potential is straightforward and opens up the enticing possibility to benchmark density functional theory and other existing methods. Finally, it is not limited to warm dense matter and can be applied to a gamut of other systems such as ultracold atoms and electrons in quantum dots.

Developing efficient nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts remains challenging. Two-dimensional metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) stand out because of their large holes and high metal utilization. Based on first-principles high-throughput calculations, we studied the catalytic capacity of MOF catalyst TM3 (HITP)2 for NRR. Our calculated results indicate that among 29 catalytic structures, Mo3(HITP)2 and Os3(HITP)2 exhibit excellent activity for NRR, with the overpotential being 0.39 and 0.43 V, respectively. The unoccupied 4d orbitals of Mo are especially closer to the antibonding N-2p orbitals, leading to better nitrogen activation and lower overpotential. In addition, a descriptor related to charge variation and the electronegativity of metals and coordinating atoms is established, which has a good volcano plot relationship with the limiting potential of NRR and can provide ideas for catalyst screening. This research contributes valuable insights for the screening of NRR catalysts based on MOF.

Abstract Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been a powerful tool to model the corrosion behaviors of materials, provide insights into the corrosion mechanisms, predict the corrosion performance of materials, and design the corrosion‐resistant alloys and organic inhibitors. DFT enables corrosion scientist to fundamentally understand the corrosion behaviors and corrosion mechanisms of materials from the perspective of atomic and electronic structures, combining with the traditional and advanced experimental tests. This review briefly summarizes the main features of DFT calculations and present a comprehensive overview of their typical applications to corrosion and corrosion prevention of metals, involving potential‐pH diagrams, hydrogen evolution reaction, anodic dissolution, passivity and passivity breakdown, and organic inhibitor for metals. The paper also reviews the correlations between DFT‐computed descriptors and the micro/macro physiochemical parameters of corrosion. Despite the great progress achieved by DFT, there are still some challenges in addressing corrosion issues due to the lack of bridges between the DFT‐calculated electronic parameters and the macro corrosion performance of materials. The DFT modeling‐experiment‐engineering‐theory model will be a potential method to clarify and build the links.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting, which encompasses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), offers a promising route for sustainable hydrogen production. The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing this technology, especially given the reliance on expensive transition metals, such as Pt and Ir, in traditional catalysts. This review highlights recent advances in the design and optimization of electrocatalysts, focusing on density functional theory (DFT) as a key tool for understanding and improving catalytic performance in the HER and OER. We begin by exploring DFT-based approaches for evaluating catalytic activity under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The review then shifts to a material-oriented perspective, showcasing key catalyst materials and the theoretical strategies employed to enhance their performance. In addition, we discuss scaling relationships that exist between binding energies and electronic structures through the use of charge-density analysis and d -band theory. Advanced concepts, such as the effects of adsorbate coverage, solvation, and applied potential on catalytic behavior, are also discussed. We finally focus on integrating machine learning (ML) with DFT to enable high-throughput screening and accelerate the discovery of novel water-splitting catalysts. This comprehensive review underscores the pivotal role that DFT plays in advancing electrocatalyst design and highlights its potential for shaping the future of sustainable hydrogen production.

The design of new alloys is a multiscale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically slow and reserved for human experts. Machine learning can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural and chemical features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLMs) and the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multimodal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities. The concerted effort of the multiagent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multiobjective design tasks and opens avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.

The kinetics of CO2RR is strongly influenced by both the electrocatalysts and the local environment at the electrode/electrolyte interface. While considerable research has focused on elucidating the “structure-activity” relationships of electrocatalysts, a fundamental understanding of the role of electrolyte-related factors (such as the ionic species) near the electrode/electrolyte interface is highly important for the further enhancement in the catalytic performance of CO2RR. In this review, we discuss the effects of pH, cations, and anions in the vicinity of the catalyst, using CO2RR as a model reaction. The mechanistic understanding of these effects is also analyzed via experimental findings from in situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical insights from density functional theory simulations. This review underscores the importance of understanding the various interactions of electrolytes with catalyst surfaces or intermediates and their impact on reaction kinetics of CO2RR.

We introduce the alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) of the absolute electronic energy for charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomics at fixed interatomic distance d0. To account for variations in distance, we combine AHA with this ansatz for the electronic binding potential, E(d)=(Eu−Es)Ec−EsEu−Esd/d0+Es, where Eu, Ec, Es correspond to the energies of the united atom, calibration at d0, and the sum of infinitely separated atoms, respectively. Our model covers the two-dimensional electronic potential energy surface spanned by distances of 0.7–2.5 Å and differences in nuclear charge from which only one single point (with elements of nuclear charge Z1, Z2, and distance d0) is drawn to calibrate Ec. Using reference data from pbe0/cc-pVDZ, we present numerical evidence for the electronic ground-state of all neutral diatomics with 8, 10, 12, and 14 electrons. We assess the validity of our model by comparison to legacy interatomic potentials (harmonic oscillator, Lennard-Jones, and Morse) within the most relevant range of binding (0.7–2.5 Å) and find comparable accuracy if restricted to single diatomics and significantly better predictive power when extrapolating to the entire iso-electronic series. We also investigated Δ-learning of the electronic absolute energy using our model as a baseline. This baseline model results in a systematic improvement, effectively reducing training data needed for reaching chemical accuracy by up to an order of magnitude from ∼1000 to ∼100. By contrast, using AHA+Morse as a baseline hardly leads to any improvement and sometimes even deteriorates the predictive power. Inferring the energy of unseen CO converges to a prediction error of ∼0.1 Ha in direct learning and ∼0.04 Ha with our baseline.
