Abstract Among various products from electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (CO 2 ER), HCOOH is highly profitable one. However, the slow kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction lowers overall energy efficiency, which can be replaced by an electro‐oxidation reaction with low thermodynamic potential and fast kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolysis system coupling CO 2 ER with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR). A BiOCl–CuO catalyst was designed to sustain CO 2 ER to HCOOH at partial current density of 500 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 90% and 700 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 80%. In situ and ex situ x‐ray absorption fine structure was used to capture the structure transform of BiOCl–CuO into metallic Bi and Cu during CO 2 ER process, and the presence of CuO will promote this transformation which are supported by DFT calculations. Coupling HMFOR with CO 2 ER, we realize both FE HCOOH and FE FDCA above 95% simultaneously, providing new prospects vista for the electrosynthesis of value‐added products from paired system.

## Strength of 2D glasses explored by machine-learning force fields

The strengths of glasses are intricately linked to their atomic-level heterogeneity. Atomistic simulations are frequently used to investigate the statistical physics of this relationship, compensating for the limited spatiotemporal resolution in experimental studies. However, theoretical insights are limited by the complexity of glass structures and the accuracy of the interatomic potentials used in simulations. Here, we investigate the strengths and fracture mechanisms of 2D silica, with all structural units accessible to direct experimental observation. We develop a neural network force field for fracture based on the deep potential-smooth edition framework. Representative atomic structures across crystals, nanocrystalline, paracrystalline, and continuous random network glasses are studied. We find that the virials or bond lengths control the initialization of bond-breaking events, creating nanoscale voids in the vitreous network. However, the voids do not necessarily lead to crack propagation due to a disorder-trapping effect, which is stronger than the lattice-trapping effect in a crystalline lattice, and occurs over larger length and time scales. Fracture initiation proceeds with void growth and coalescence and advances through a bridging mechanism. The fracture patterns are shaped by subsequent trapping and cleavage steps, often guided by voids forming ahead of the crack tip. These heterogeneous processes result in atomically smooth facets in crystalline regions and rough, amorphous edges in the glassy phase. These insights into 2D crystals and glasses, both sharing SiO2 chemistry, highlight the pivotal role of atomic-level structures in determining fracture kinetics and crack path selection in materials.

Structural evolution of solid catalyst surfaces induced by direct exposure to reaction gas has been extensively studied and is well understood. However, whether and how subsurface atomic structures are affected by the reaction atmosphere require further exploration. In this work, our results confirm that Cu clusters supported on FeO/Pt(111) (Cu

First-principles electronic structure simulations are an invaluable tool for understanding chemical bonding and reactions. While machine-learning models such as interatomic potentials significantly accelerate the exploration of potential energy surfaces, electronic structure information is generally lost. Particularly in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, simulated electron band structures provide fundamental insights into catalytic reactivity. This ab initio knowledge is preserved in semiempirical methods such as density functional tight binding (DFTB), which extend the accessible computational length and time scales beyond first-principles approaches. In this paper we present Shell-Optimized Atomic Confinement (SOAC) DFTB electronic-part-only parametrizations for bulk and surface band structures of all

Diamond is a semiconductor material with remarkable structural, thermal, and electronic properties that has garnered significant interest in the field of electronics. Although hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) terminations are conventionally favored in transistor designs, alternative options, such as silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), are being explored because of their resilience to harsh processing conditions during fabrication. Density-functional theory was used to examine the non-oxidized and oxidized group-IV (Si and Ge)-terminated diamond (100) surfaces. The (3 × 1) reconstructed surfaces feature an ether configuration and show relative stability compared with the bare surface. Hybrid-functional calculations of the electronic properties revealed reduced fundamental bandgaps (&lt;1 eV) and lower negative electron affinities (NEAs) than those of H-terminated diamond surfaces, which is attributed to the introduction of unoccupied Si (Ge) states and the depletion of negative charges. Furthermore, oxidation of these surfaces enhanced the stability of the diamond surfaces but resulted in two structural configurations: ether and ketone. Oxidized ether configurations displayed insulating properties with energy gaps of ∼4.3 ± 0.3 eV, similar to H-terminated diamond (100) surfaces, whereas bridged ether configurations exhibited metallic properties. Oxidization of the metallic ketone configurations leads to the opening of relatively smaller gaps in the range of 1.1–1.7 eV. Overall, oxidation induced a shift from NEAs to positive electron affinities, except for the reverse-ordered ketone surface with an NEA of −0.94 eV, a value comparable to the H-terminated diamond (100) surfaces. In conclusion, oxidized group-IV-terminated diamond surfaces offer enhanced stability compared to H-terminated surfaces and display unique structural and electronic properties that are influenced by surface bonding.

Automatic differentiation (AD) emerged as an integral part of machine learning, accelerating model development by enabling gradient-based optimization without explicit analytical derivatives. Recently, the benefits of AD and computing arbitrary-order derivatives with respect to any variable were also recognized in the field of quantum chemistry. In this work, we present dxtb—an open-source, fully differentiable framework for semiempirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods. Developed entirely in Python and leveraging PyTorch for array operations, dxtb facilitates extensibility and rapid prototyping while maintaining computational efficiency. Through comprehensive code vectorization and optimization, we essentially reach the speed of compiled xTB programs for high-throughput calculations of small molecules. The excellent performance also scales to large systems, and batch operability yields additional benefits for execution on parallel hardware. In particular, energy evaluations are on par with existing programs, whereas the speed of automatically differentiated nuclear derivatives is only 2 to 5 times slower compared to their analytical counterparts. We showcase the utility of AD in dxtb by calculating various molecular and spectroscopic properties, highlighting its capacity to enhance and simplify such evaluations. Furthermore, the framework streamlines optimization tasks and offers seamless integration of semiempirical quantum chemistry in machine learning, paving the way for physics-inspired end-to-end differentiable models. Ultimately, dxtb aims to further advance the capabilities of semiempirical methods, providing an extensible foundation for future developments and hybrid machine learning applications. The framework is accessible at https://github.com/grimme-lab/dxtb.

Abstract All-solid-state Li-metal batteries can conceivably improve the safety and extend the driving ranges of electric vehicles. In this regard, the garnet-type solid electrolyte Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZ) has garnered considerable attention because of its high Li-ion conductivity and nonreactivity towards molten Li metal. Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a universal neural network potential (UNNP) to analyse the Li-ion exchange at the LLZ/Li interface at the atomic scale. The UNNP-MD calculations show that Li ions traverse the LLZ/Li interface and that excess Li ions relative to the stoichiometric composition accumulate in an approximately 1 nm-thick zone near the LLZ phase interface, signifying the formation of a space-charge layer. Electronic structural analysis of the UNNP-MD-derived configuration, performed using density functional theory calculations, reveals band bending near the LLZ phase interface and the simultaneous suppression of Li metal reduction. These findings can help expedite the development of rationally designed all-solid-state Li-metal batteries.

Abstract NiFe‐based nanomaterials are extensively studied as one of the promising candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their practical application is still largely impeded by the unsatisfied activity and poor durability caused by the severe leaching of active species. Herein, a rapid and facile combustion method is developed to synthesize the vertical graphene (VG) supported N‐doped carbon modified (Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se composites (NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG). The interconnected heterostructure of obtained materials plays a vital role in boosting the catalytic performance, offering rich active sites and convenient pathways for rapid electron and ion transport. The incorporation of Se into NiFe facilitates the formation of active species via in situ surface reconstruction. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the in situ formation of a Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 Se/Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 OOH layer significantly enhances the catalytic activity of NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG. Furthermore, the surface‐adsorbed selenoxide species contribute to the stabilization of the catalytic active phase and increase the overall stability. The obtained NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG exhibits a low overpotential of 220 mV at 20 mA cm −2 and long‐term stability over 300 h. This work offers a novel perspective on the design and fabrication of OER electrocatalysts with high activity and stability.

Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) represent a cutting-edge advancement in nanomaterials, merging the high catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes with the benefits of atomic economy. Traditionally, natural enzymes exhibit high specificity and efficiency, but their stability are limited by environmental conditions and production costs. Here we show that SAzymes, with their large specific surface area and high atomic utilization, achieve superior catalytic activity. However, their high dispersibility poses stability challenges. Our review focuses on recent structural and preparative advancements aimed at enhancing the catalytic specificity and stability of SAzymes. Compared to previous nanozymes, SAzymes demonstrate significantly improved performance in biomedical applications, particularly in tumor medicine. This progress positions SAzymes as a promising tool for future cancer treatment strategies, integrating the robustness of inorganic materials with the specificity of biological systems. The development and application of SAzymes could revolutionize the field of biocatalysis, offering a stable, cost-effective alternative to natural enzymes.

Machine learning techniques have significantly transformed the way materials scientists conduct research. However, the widespread deployment of machine learning software in daily experimental and simulation research for materials and chemical design has been limited. This is partly due to the substantial time investment and learning curve associated with mastering the necessary codes and computational environments. In this paper, we introduce a user-friendly, data-driven machine learning interface featuring multiple "button-clicking" functionalities to streamline the design of materials and chemicals. This interface automates the processes of transforming materials and molecules, performing feature selection, constructing machine learning models, making virtual predictions, and visualizing results. Such automation accelerates materials prediction and analysis in the inverse design process, aligning with the time criteria outlined by the Materials Genome Initiative. With simple button clicks, researchers can build machine learning models and predict new materials once they have gathered experimental or simulation data. Beyond the ease of use, NJmat offers three additional features for data-driven materials design: (1) automatic feature generation for both inorganic materials (from chemical formulas) and organic molecules (from SMILES), (2) automatic generation of Shapley plots, and (3) automatic construction of "white-box" genetic models and decision trees to provide scientific insights. We present case studies on surface design for halide perovskite materials encompassing both inorganic and organic species. These case studies illustrate general machine learning models for virtual predictions as well as the automatic featurization and Shapley/genetic model construction capabilities. We anticipate that this software tool will expedite materials and molecular design within the scope of the Materials Genome Initiative, particularly benefiting experimentalists.

Abstract Molecular catalysts represent an exceptional class of materials in the realm of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR), offering distinct advantages owing to their adaptable structure, which enables precise control of electronic configurations and outstanding performance in CO 2 RR. This study introduces an innovative approach to heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 RR in an aqueous environment, utilizing a newly synthesized N4‐macrocyclic cobalt complex generated through a dimerization coupling reaction. By incorporating the quaterpyridine moiety, this cobalt complex exhibits the capability to catalyze CO 2 RR at low overpotentials and reaches near‐unity CO production across a wide potential range, as verified by the online mass spectrometry and in situ attenuated total reflectance‐Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Comprehensive computational models demonstrate the superiority of utilizing quarterpyridine moiety in mediating CO 2 conversion compared to the counterpart. This work not only propels the field of electrochemical CO 2 RR but also underscores the promising potential of cobalt complexes featuring quaterpyridine moieties in advancing sustainable CO 2 conversion technologies within aqueous environments.

Abstract The study of Pt clusters and nanoparticles is a prominent area of research due to their ex- tensive range of potential technological applications, particularly in the field of catalysis. The electronic properties of Pt clusters that result in optimal catalytic performance at the nanoscale are significantly influenced by their size and structure. In this report, we sought to evaluate the lowest-energy candidates for Pt18−20 species via Density Functional Theory, identifying more favorable conformers than those previously documented in the literature. New low-symmetry conformers for the Pt19 and Pt20 systems were identified, which are 3.0 and 1.0 kcal/mol more stable, respectively, than previously reported structures (Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys., 2008, 77, 205418). Furthermore, we examined the impact of diverse DFT ap- proximations, including GGA (PBE), meta-GGA (TPSS, M06-L), hybrid (PBE0 and PBEh), meta-GGA hybrid (TPSSh), and range-separated hybrid (ωB97x) functionals. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the employed basis sets in determining the relative energies and structures of the investigated clusters. Our findings indicate that a correct energy ordering for the different isomers examined can only be achieved by employing density functional approximations that incorporate moderate levels of exact Hartree-Fock exchange, in conjunction with the utilization of basis sets of at least quadruple-zeta quality. The resulting structures are asymmetric, with different active sites as evidenced by the analysis of the sigma holes on the electrostatic potential surface. This observation suggests a potential correlation between the electronic structure and the catalytic properties of these Pt clusters, which merits further investigation. We expect that this work will prove to be a valuable reference point for future electronic structure reports dealing with the precise ordering of structures in the determination of global minima of metallic clusters.

Resolving the detailed structures of metal organic frameworks is of great significance for understanding their structure-property relation. Real-space imaging methods could exhibit superiority in revealing not only the local structure but also the bulk symmetry of these complex porous materials, compared to reciprocal-space diffraction methods, despite the technical challenges. Here we apply a low-dose imaging technique to clearly resolve the atomic structures of building units in a metal-organic framework, MIL-125. An unexpected node structure is discovered by directly imaging the rotation of Ti-O nodes, different from the unrotated structure predicted by previous X-ray diffraction. The imaged structure and symmetry can be confirmed by the structural simulations and energy calculations. Then, the distribution of node rotation from the edge to the center of a MIL-125 particle is revealed by the image analysis of Ti-O rotation. The related defects and surface terminations in MIL-125 are also investigated in the real-space images. These results not only unraveled the node symmetry in MIL-125 with atomic resolution but also inspired further studies on discovering more unpredicted structural changes in other porous materials by real-space imaging methods.

Platinum exhibits desirable catalytic properties, but it is scarce and expensive. Optimizing its use in key applications such as emission control catalysis is important to reduce our reliance on such a rare element. Supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) used in emission control systems deactivate over time because of particle growth in sintering processes. In this work, we shed light on the stability against sintering of Pt NPs supported on and encapsulated in Al

Abstract Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are an important enabler of the nascent hydrogen economy. However, due to the reliance on precious metal catalysts like platinum, reducing the cost and broad penetration of PEMFCs beyond vehicle application remains a challenge. In this respect, alternative non‐precious metal catalysts and other carbon‐based catalysts remain the holy grail toward advanced low‐cost PEMFC. This review summarizes recent progress along the development of non‐precious catalysts and their performance under PEMFC operation. Critical factors such as the activity, stability, and durability of non‐precious metal catalysts and their associated mechanisms including the paths leading to degradation are discussed. Ultimately, the review concludes by highlighting the impressive activity and potential of NPM catalysts and the areas of focus to enable the translation of non‐precious catalysts to commercially viable PEMFC systems.

Atomic-scale simulations have progressed tremendously over the past decade, largely thanks to the availability of machine-learning interatomic potentials. These potentials combine the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with the ability to reach extensive length and time scales. The i-PI package facilitates integrating the latest developments in this field with advanced modeling techniques thanks to a modular software architecture based on inter-process communication through a socket interface. The choice of Python for implementation facilitates rapid prototyping but can add computational overhead. In this new release, we carefully benchmarked and optimized i-PI for several common simulation scenarios, making such overhead negligible when i-PI is used to model systems up to tens of thousands of atoms using widely adopted machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Behler–Parinello, DeePMD, and MACE neural networks. We also present the implementation of several new features, including an efficient algorithm to model bosonic and fermionic exchange, a framework for uncertainty quantification to be used in conjunction with machine-learning potentials, a communication infrastructure that allows for deeper integration with electronic-driven simulations, and an approach to simulate coupled photon-nuclear dynamics in optical or plasmonic cavities.

Atomistic simulations often rely on interatomic potentials to access greater time and length scales than those accessible to first-principles methods, such as density functional theory. However, since a parameterized potential typically cannot reproduce the true potential energy surface of a given system, we should expect a decrease in accuracy and increase in error in quantities of interest calculated from these simulations. Quantifying the uncertainty on the outputs of atomistic simulations is thus an important, necessary step so that there is confidence in the results and available metrics to explore improvements in said simulations. Here, we address this research question by forming ensembles of atomic cluster expansion potentials, and using conformal prediction with ab initio training data to provide meaningful, calibrated error bars on several quantities of interest for silicon: the bulk modulus, elastic constants, relaxed vacancy formation energy, and the vacancy migration barrier. We evaluate the effects on uncertainty bounds using a range of different potentials and training sets.

Abstract Grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly influence the properties and performance of materials, emphasizing the importance of understanding the GB structure and phase behavior. As recent computational studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple GB phases associated with varying the atomic density at the interface, we introduce a validated, open-source GRand canonical Interface Predictor (GRIP) tool that automates high-throughput, grand canonical optimization of GB structures. While previous studies of GB phases have almost exclusively focused on cubic systems, we demonstrate the utility of GRIP in an application to hexagonal close-packed titanium. We perform a systematic high-throughput exploration of tilt GBs in titanium and discover previously unreported structures and phase transitions. In low-angle boundaries, we demonstrate a coupling between point defect absorption and the change in the GB dislocation network topology due to GB phase transformations, which has important implications for the accommodation of radiation-induced defects.

We present an efficient first-principles based method geared toward reliably predicting the structures of solid materials across the Periodic Table. To this end, we use a density functional theory baseline with a compact, near-minimal min+s basis set, yielding low computational costs and memory demands. Since the use of such a small basis set leads to systematic errors in chemical bond lengths, we develop a linear pairwise correction, available for elements Z = 1–86 (excluding the lanthanide series), parameterized for use with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional. We demonstrate the reliability of this corrected approach for equilibrium volumes across the Periodic Table and the transferability to differently coordinated environments and multi-elemental crystals. We examine relative energies, forces, and stresses in geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations.

We consider the electron stimulated desorption, via dissociative electron attachment, of anionic species from thin condensed CD4 films deposited on a Pt substrate and compare experimentally observed desorption yields with density functional theory calculations of the binding energies of various anionic and neutral moieties to Pt(111). Certain species (which can be considered chemisorbed) exhibit very high binding energies and large charge transfer with the substrate. Other "physisorbed" species have much lower binding energies. Species that chemisorb have lower desorption yields than those that physisorb, especially at 1-2 monolayer coverage of the Pt substrate. The binding energy of D- to Pt is the weakest, and experimentally, the desorption yield is the highest regardless of the thickness of CD4. The calculations show that the formation and desorption of anionic species at a distance of 16 Å from the substrate, which is equivalent to the thickness of CD4 films of four monolayers, are not influenced by the short-range interactions between the substrate and the molecule and DEA products.
