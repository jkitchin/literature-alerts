Abstract Uncertainty quantification (UQ) to detect samples with large expected errors (outliers) is applied to reactive molecular potential energy surfaces (PESs). Three methods–Ensembles, deep evidential regression (DER), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)—were applied to the H-transfer reaction between syn -Criegee and vinyl hydroxyperoxide. The results indicate that ensemble models provide the best results for detecting outliers, followed by GMM. For example, from a pool of 1000 structures with the largest uncertainty, the detection quality for outliers is ~90% and ~50%, respectively, if 25 or 1000 structures with large errors are sought. On the contrary, the limitations of the statistical assumptions of DER greatly impact its prediction capabilities. Finally, a structure-based indicator was found to be correlated with large average error, which may help to rapidly classify new structures into those that provide an advantage for refining the neural network.

The sluggish kinetics of oxygen‐involved electrolysis, such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hinders the efficiency of the pertaining energy conversion process, which can be promoted by using spin‐selective materials to align the spin direction of oxygen‐involved intermediates. This review delivers a thorough and timely overview of state‐of‐the‐art spin‐selective catalysts for OER and ORR. Primarily, the fundamental principle of spin‐selective process is depicted by the spin‐sensitive reaction pathways, pointing out that the existence of spin‐polarized adsorption sites is necessary for the development of spin‐selective catalysts. Subsequently, approaches for investigating the spin‐related transition during electrocatalysis are introduced by reviewing in situ technologies and theoretical calculations. Then, the reported spin‐selective catalysts are categorized into intrinsic spin‐polarized materials, doping‐induced spin‐polarized materials, and multiple magnetic composites to discuss their application in electrocatalytic OER and ORR as well as their mechanism of spin polarization. Finally, the open questions and prospects in this field are concluded, aiming to offer a clear route for designing novel and highly‐efficient spin‐polarized materials for industrial oxygen‐involved electrocatalysis.

Abstract Direct formic acid fuel cells are promising energy devices with advantages of low working temperature and high safety in fuel storage and transport. They have been expected to be a future power source for portable electronic devices. The technology has been developed rapidly to overcome the high cost and low power performance that hinder its practical application, which mainly originated from the slow reaction kinetics of the formic acid oxidation and complex mass transfer within the fuel cell electrodes. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the progress around this technology, in particular for addressing multiscale challenges from catalytic mechanism understanding at the atomic scale, to catalyst design at the nanoscale, electrode structure at the micro scale and design at the millimeter scale, and finally to device fabrication at the meter scale. The gap between the highly active electrocatalysts and the poor electrode performance in practical devices is highlighted. Finally, perspectives and opportunities are proposed to potentially bridge this gap for further development of this technology.    

    

## Recombination of Autodissociated Water Ions in a Nanoscale Pure Water Droplet

The recombination of water ions has diverse scientific and practical implications, ranging from acid–base chemistry and biological systems to planetary environments and applications in fuel cell and carbon conversion technologies. While spatial confinement affects the physicochemical properties of water dynamics, its impact on the recombination process has rarely been studied. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of water, the water ion distribution, and the ion recombination process in water droplets as a function of droplet size through molecular dynamics simulations and adaptive quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations. We compare the dynamics of recombination in water droplet sizes ranging from 100 to 18 000 waters, both in their interiors and on their surfaces. We found that the self-diffusion of water dramatically decreases in droplets with a diameter below 2.2 nm. Using a classical RexPoN force-field, we found that the ions in 1000 H2O's spend almost 50% of the time on the surface and 0.5 nm beneath it with a slight preference for OH– ion to reside longer on the surface. We estimate that, on average, recombination in these drops occurs at 400 ps in 1000 H2O's and 1 ns in 3000 H2O's. We also found that recombination is not limited by the local structure of the surface or the size of the droplet but can be influenced by the geometry of the water wire connecting the ions as they approach each other, which can often prevent recombination. Our results provide insights to the reaction microenvironments presented by nanoscopic water droplets.

Abstract Neuronally triggered phosphorylation drives the dynamic condensation of reflectin proteins, enabling squid to fine tune the colors reflected from specialized skin cells (iridocytes) for camouflage and communication. Reflectin, the primary component of iridocyte lamellae, forms alternating layers of protein and low refractive index extracellular space within membrane‐encapsulated structures, acting as a biologically tunable distributed Bragg reflector. In vivo, reflectin condensation induces osmotic dehydration of these lamellae, reducing their thickness and shifting the wavelength of reflected light. Inspired by this natural mechanism, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of imidazolium moieties within the protein provides a reversible and tunable method to control the water volume fraction in reflectin thin films, allowing precise, dynamic modulation of the film’s refractive index and thickness — mimicking the squid’s dynamic color adaptation. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we developed electrochemical correlative ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, enabling real‐time analysis of optical property changes of reflectin films. This electrochemically driven approach offers unprecedented control over reflectin condensation dynamics. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of biophysical processes governing cephalopod coloration but also pave the way for bio‐inspired materials and devices that seamlessly integrate biological principles with synthetic systems to bridge the biotic‐abiotic gap.

This study investigates the formation and stability of passivation films in medium-entropy CrCoNi alloy using an integrated approach combining first-principles calculations and Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP). By performing extensive structural relaxations coupled with random occupancy of the alloy and multiple potential adsorption sites, the results based on surface reconstruction are analyzed. Our results demonstrate that disordered atomic structures in medium entropy CrCoNi alloy exhibit improved oxide film stability compared to ordered structures, with lower system energies correlating with more robust passivation layers. Furthermore, by constructing physically meaningful descriptors and employing symbolic regression in complex surface environments, simple yet highly correlated rules are obtained, providing insights into the passivation strengthening of CrCoNi alloy from both global and local perspectives. Our work paves the way for exploring surface regularities in complex medium-entropy alloys with the combination of quantum mechanical accuracy and machine learning efficiency.

Abstract The design of efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts is crucial for the development of green hydrogen production. In this work, we report modulation the HER activity of Ru nanoparticles by functionalization using para‐substituted phenylacetylenes (R = Cl, H, C 2 H 5 , and OCH 3 ), which have different electron donating/withdrawing capabilities. A close correlation between the Hammett substituent constant of the phenylacetylenes and HER activity of the functionalized Ru nanoparticles is revealed, and the underlying mechanism is investigated. Guided by such correlation, 4‐ethylphenylacetylene‐modified Ru nanoparticles (Ru─EPA) with a low HER overpotential of 17.7 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline solution is developed. The mechanistic understanding gained in this work will provide important guidelines for future development of high‐performance nanostructured electrocatalyst.

Neutrons, owing to their unique properties, serve as indispensable probes for investigating the structure and dynamics of materials across various length scales. The scientific community utilizing neutron research infrastructures encompasses a diverse range of disciplines, making it challenging to quantify its scientific and societal impact. To address this challenge, we apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze the scientific output of the European neutron science community. Leveraging open-source software toolkits, our method allows for the quantitative assessment of community evolution and research focus. Our analysis reveals consistent growth in the neutron community despite a reduction in sources, underscoring the enduring significance of neutron methods in scientific research. Furthermore, an increase in unique authors and an even distribution of publications across diverse scientific topics highlight the community's interdisciplinary nature and collaborative spirit. While this study emphasizes neutron scattering, our methodology holds promise for a broad range of scientific communities reliant on Large Research Infrastructures (LRIs), offering opportunities for collaboration, optimization of experimental approaches, and informed decision-making by governmental and funding bodies.

Abstract This study introduces a pioneering application of triiodide ionic liquids (ILs) for the efficient and sustainable recovery of gold (Au) from real‐world, various types of electronic wastes. Our method significantly reduces both environmental impact and reagent expenses, while operating under mild conditions. This technique is ideal for practical applications given its ultra‐fast leaching (5 min) and room temperature (35°C) reaction conditions, leading to an unprecedented 11‐fold enhancement in the reaction kinetics relative to aqua regia. Notably, more than 99.3% of Au from e‐waste can be selectively dissolved while excluding non‐target elements like Cu. Compared with conventional dissolution‐extraction processes, our method facilitates the process into a single step. Additionally, the triiodide ILs can be reused for up to six cycles, and have an impressive economic output–input ratio of 1969%, which demonstrates promising technoeconomic feasibility. This approach provides a valuable strategy for profit‐efficient management of e‐waste, promoting a circular economy.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction using renewable energy provides a sustainable solution to mitigate greenhouse effects and achieve carbon neutrality. Developing high-performance electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is key to promoting such a technology. Herein, we systematically explored the CO2RR catalytic activity of 325 dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Among them, the Sc/Tc DMSC is particularly advantageous for HCOOH, CH4, and CH3CH2OH production, with limiting potentials of −0.45 V, −0.45 V, and −0.46 V, respectively. The Ti/Rh DMSC can selectively convert CO2 to CH3CH2OH at ultralow overpotentials (UL = −0.21 V). HCOOH is the preferred product of the CO2RR on the Mn/Fe site with a UL of −0.30 V. Mn/Fe presents the highest inhibitory effects on the side reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a UL of −0.66 V. Moreover, electronic analysis was conducted to further explain the enhancement for the CO2RR of explored catalysts at the subatomic level. Our work offers a strategy for screening of high-performance DMSCs and reveals the mechanisms of the CO2RR to target products for selected catalysts, benefiting the further development of CO2RR electrocatalysts.

Abstract Nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) is a powerful technique for eliminating pollution. Here, NO 3 RRs on transition metal‐doped boron nitride fullerene (TM/B 11 N 12 ) were thoroughly examined utilizing density functional theory (DFT). Co/B 11 N 12 , a potential single‐atom catalyst (SAC) with a low thermal barrier for NO 3 RR toward NH 3 synthesis with good stability, activity, and selectivity, was successfully screened out. Co/B 11 N 12 has the lowest limiting potential ( U L ) of −0.45 V and good NO 3 RR performance. Due to the comparatively restrained adsorption of proton on Co/B 11 N 12 , competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is substantially limited. The excellent selectivity for the production of NH 3 is ensured by significant energy barrier prerequisite for the formation of by‐products (NO, NO 2 , N 2 O, and N 2 ) on Co/B 11 N 12 . By ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, Co/B 11 N 12 exhibits remarkable structural stability at 400 K with minimal distortion as compared to its initial shape. Our research may not only offer a fundamental understanding of the activity origin of NO 3 RR and catalytic mechanism on TM/B 11 N 12 but also open up opportunities for rational designing of SACs for NO 3 RR toward the NH 3 synthesis.

Chalcogenide perovskites are lead-free materials for potential photovoltaic or thermoelectric applications. BaZrS3 is the most-studied member of this family due to its superior thermal and chemical stability, desirable optoelectronic properties, and low thermal conductivity. Phase transitions in BaZrS3 remain underexplored in the literature, as most experimental characterizations of this material have been performed at ambient conditions where the orthorhombic Pnma phase is reported to be stable. In this work, we study the dynamics of BaZrS3 across a range of temperatures and pressures using an accurate machine learning interatomic potential trained with data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. At 0 Pa, we find a first-order phase transition from the orthorhombic to tetragonal I4/mcm phase at 610 K, and a second-order transition from the tetragonal to the cubic Pm3̅m phase at 880 K. The tetragonal phase is stable over a larger temperature range at higher pressures. To confirm the validity of our model we compare our results with a range of published experimental data and report a prediction for the X-ray diffraction pattern as a function of temperature.

Understanding the semiconductor-electrolyte interface in photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems is crucial for optimizing the stability and reactivity. Despite the challenges in establishing reliable surface structure models during PEC cycles, this study explores the complex surface reconstructions of BiVO4(010) by employing a computational workflow integrated with a state-of-the-art active learning protocol for a machine-learning interatomic potential and global optimization techniques. Within this workflow, we identified 494 unique reconstructed surface structures that surpass conventional chemical intuition-driven, bulk-truncated models. After constructing the surface Pourbaix diagram under Bi- and V-rich electrolyte conditions using density functional theory and hybrid functional calculations, we proposed structural models for the experimentally observed Bi-rich BiVO4 surfaces. By performing hybrid functional molecular dynamics simulations with the explicit treatment of water molecules on selected reconstructed BiVO4(010) surfaces, we observed water dissociation from molecular water. Our findings demonstrate significant water dissociation on reconstructed Bi-rich surfaces, highlighting the critical role of bare and undercoordinated Bi sites (only observable in reconstructed surfaces) in driving hydration processes. Our work establishes a foundation for understanding the role of complex, reconstructed Bi surfaces in surface hydration and reactivity. Additionally, our theoretical framework for exploring surface structures and predicting reactivity in multicomponent oxides offers a precise approach to describing complex surface and interface processes in PEC systems.

Abstract Applying electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) to produce ammonia offers a sustainable alternative to the energy‐intensive Haber‐Bosch process, which is crucial for clean energy and agricultural applications. While 2D MXenes hold great promise as electrocatalysts for NO 3 RR, their application for ammonia production remains underexplored. This study combines experimental and theoretical approaches to evaluate the catalytic performance of a series of MXenes with different central metal atoms for NO 3 RR. Among the materials studied (Ti 3 C 2 T x , Ti 3 CNT x , Ti 2 CT x , V 2 CT x , Cr 2 CT x , Nb 2 CT x , and Ta 2 CT x ), Ti 3 ‐based MXenes exhibit superior faradaic efficiency, ammonia yield rate, and stability. Density functional theory calculations offer further insights explaining the structure‐activity‐based observations. This research establishes a foundation for future studies aimed at leveraging MXenes for electrochemical nitrate reduction for green synthesis of ammonia.

Abstract Solid‐state crystalline multimetal oxides have been widely studied for their applications as electrode materials, e. g., in fuel cells, water electrolyzer, lithium‐ion batteries, and metal‐air batteries. Particularly, hydrogen production via water electrolysis is considered a key technology for realizing a sustainable circular carbon society. Enhancing the activity of electrocatalysts is a critical challenge for improving the efficiency of the water electrolysis technology. Thus, strategies for designing prominent catalyst materials have drawn considerable attention. Our group has been conducting research aimed at establishing comprehensive design strategies for the rational and rapid development of highly active catalysts. In this Personal Account, we present our research efforts on enhancing the activity of cost‐efficient nonprecious metal‐based oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode of water electrolysis. Specifically, we propose design strategies based on crystal structures of multimetal oxides and demonstrate how these strategies have contributed to the development of highly active electrocatalysts.

Abstract Photocatalysis has emerged as an alternative to high energy‐demanding CO 2 reduction reactions. Among the widely studied photocatalysts, g‐C 3 N 4 stands out due to its composition based on earth‐abundant elements, its ability to absorb visible light, and its suitable band structure. In this study, a photocatalyst based on an S‐scheme heterojunction formed by g‐C 3 N 4 and nanosized Fe 2 TiO 5 is successfully prepared via simple hydrothermal assembly of both pre‐synthesized semiconductors. Modifications induced on g‐C 3 N 4 during the heterojunction preparation play a crucial role in the efficiency of the CO 2 photoreduction reaction. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the g‐C 3 N 4 /Fe 2 TiO 5 heterojunction exhibits higher photocatalytic performance than the pristine materials for both CO 2 reduction to produce CO and CH 4 , and H 2 O reduction reaction, producing H 2 . The results obtained correspond to a 1.5‐fold improvement compared to pristine g‐C 3 N 4 . When [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ is applied as a sensitizer, the visible light (>380 nm) activity of the photocatalytic system is restored, showing lower activity but higher selectivity toward CO and H 2 production, a route to renewable syngas.
