Water electro-oxidation to form H2O2 is an important way to produce H2O2 which is widely applied in industry. However, its mechanism is under debate and HO(ads), hydroxyl group adsorbed onto the surface of the electrode, is regarded as an important intermediate. Herein, we study the mechanism of water oxidation to H2O2 at Pt electrode using in-situ Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and find peroxide bond mainly originated from the coupling of two CO32- via a C2O62- intermediate. By quantifying the 18O isotope in the product, we find that 93% of H2O2 was formed via the CO32- coupling route and 7% of H2O2 is from OH(ads)-CO3•− route. The OH(ads)-OH(ads) coupling route has a negligible contribution. The comparison of various electrodes shows that the strong adsorption of CO3(ads) at the electrode surface is essential. Combining with a commercial cathode catalyst to produce H2O2 during oxygen reduction, we assemble a flow cell in which the cathode and anode simultaneously produce H2O2. It shows a Faradaic efficiency of 150% of H2O2 at 1 A cm−2 with a cell voltage of 2.3 V. Electrosynthesis via two electron water reactions offers a promising method for decentralized H2O2 production, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Here, the authors address the challenge by using in-situ Raman and DEMS, and demonstrate 93% of H2O2 forms via the carbonate coupling route through a C2O62− intermediate.

Abstract Ammonia is an important raw material for agricultural production, playing a key role in global food production. However, conventional ammonia synthesis resulted in extensive greenhouse gas emissions and huge energy consumption. Recently, researchers have proposed electrocatalytic reverse artificial nitrogen cycle (eRANC) routes to circumvent these issues, which can be driven by electrocatalysis and sustainable electricity. Here, a theoretical and computational perspective on the challenges and opportunities with the comparison with experimental results: electrochemical reduction of nitrate (eNO 3 RR) and nitrite (eNO 2 RR), electrochemical reduction of nitric oxide (eNORR) combined with oxidative nitrogen fixation are presented. By comparison, the N 2 →NO→NH 3 route is proposed as the most promising in case the NO solubility can be solved well in reactor design. Its high efficiency of ammonia production is demonstrated. Instead, the eNO 3 RR can be another choice because it is non‐toxic and the solid‐liquid interface is usually efficient for electrochemical reactions, while its low selectivity at low overpotentials is an issue. These fundamentals highlight the potential and key factors of eRANC as an efficient and sustainable route for ammonia production.

Abstract Seawater direct electrolysis (SDE) using renewable energy provides a sustainable pathway to harness abundant oceanic hydrogen resources. However, the side-reaction of the chlorine electro-oxidation reaction (ClOR) severely decreased direct electrolysis efficiency of seawater and gradually corrodes the anode. In this study, a redox-mediated strategy is introduced to suppress the ClOR, and a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis (DSDE) system incorporating a separate O 2 evolution reactor is established. Ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN) 6 ] 3−/4− ) serves as an electron-mediator between the cell and the reactor, thereby enabling a more dynamically favorable half-reaction to supplant the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This alteration involves a straightforward, single-electron-transfer anodic reaction without gas precipitation and effectively eliminates the generation of chlorine-containing byproducts. By operating at low voltages (~1.37 V at 10 mA cm −2 and ~1.57 V at 100 mA cm −2 ) and maintaining stability even in a Cl − -saturated seawater electrolyte, this system has the potential of undergoing decoupled seawater electrolysis with zero chlorine emissions. Further improvements in the high-performance redox-mediators and catalysts can provide enhanced cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the DSDE system.

A general formulation of biasing particle insertion/deletion for the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation is presented. The proposed formulation unifies the concepts of the conventional cavity- and configurational-type biasing techniques and modifies a cavity biasing method to strictly satisfy the detailed balance condition. Numerical examples of this modified cavity bias method are presented for Lennard–Jones fluid and hydrogen adsorption on a platinum surface. The results obtained using this method are compared with those obtained using various GCMC methods. Furthermore, a rigorous on-the-fly on-lattice GCMC simulation for surface adsorption is formulated and performed for comparison. The numerical examples clearly demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed formulation.

ABSTRACT The adsorption properties of ionic liquids containing pyrrolidinium cations and various inorganic anions as electrolytes on a platinum surface were analyzed using first principle density functional theory. Three different orientations of the alkyl cation chain were observed during the adsorption process. The strength and structural stability varied between non‐fluorinated and fluorinated anions upon adsorption, with oxygen atoms influencing the mechanism of adsorption and driving the structural stability of the anion, while fluorine atoms played a role in determining the orientation of the cation during adsorption. Net atomic charges analysis, electron density difference methods, and electron density accumulation for this complex system were utilized to further investigate these phenomena. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the role of anions in the adsorption behavior of pyrrolidinium‐based ionic liquids on platinum surfaces, shedding light on the factors that influence their adsorption properties and structural stability on a molecular level. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between anions and platinum surfaces in the adsorption of pyrrolidinium based ionic liquids, which can have implications for various applications such as electrochemistry, catalysis, and energy storage.

There is a great deal of interest in the development of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that are stable and have high activity because this anodic half-reaction is the main bottleneck in water splitting and other key technologies. Cobalt and iron oxide and oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts constitute a cheaper alternative to the highly active and commonly used Ir- and Ru-based catalysts. Most of the described electrocatalysts require tedious synthetic and expensive preparation procedures. We report here a facile and straightforward preparation of an electrocatalyst by a combination of commercial compounds, such as cobalt chloride and ferrocene. A highly active and stable OER electrocatalyst is obtained, which shows a low overpotential in the alkaline medium as a consequence of a synergistic effect between both compounds and is inexpensive.

The rational design of dielectric fluids for immersion cooling of batteries requires a molecular-level understanding of the heat flow across the battery casing/dielectric fluid interface. Here, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to quantify the interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) between hematite and poly-α-olefin (PAO), which are representative of the outer surface of the steel battery casing and a synthetic hydrocarbon dielectric fluid, respectively. After identifying the most suitable force fields to model the thermal properties of the individual components, we then compared different solid–liquid interaction potentials for the calculation of the ITR. These potentials resulted in a wide range of ITR values (4–21 K m2 GW–1), with stronger solid–liquid interactions leading to lower ITR. The increase in ITR is correlated with an increase in density of the fluid layer closest to the surface. Since the ITR has not been experimentally measured for the hematite/PAO interface, we validate the solid–liquid interaction potential using the work of adhesion calculated using the dry-surface method. The work of adhesion calculations from the simulations were compared to those derived from experimental contact angle measurements for PAO on steel. We find that all of the solid–liquid potentials overestimate the experimental work of adhesion. The experiments and simulations can only be reconciled by further reducing the strength of the interfacial interactions. This suggests some screening of the solid–liquid interactions, which may be due to the presence of an interfacial water layer between PAO and steel in the contact angle experiments. Using the solid–liquid interaction potential that reproduces the experimental work of adhesion, we obtain a higher ITR (33 K m2 GW–1), suggesting inefficient thermal transport. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for NEMD simulations to improve understanding of the nanoscale thermal transport across industrially important interfaces. This study represents an important step toward the rational design of more effective fluids for immersion cooling systems for electric vehicles and other applications where thermal management is of high importance.

Heterogeneous interfaces influence chemical reactions by stabilizing the adsorption of reactive intermediates, lowering activation barriers of rate- and selectivity-determining steps. Here, we elucidate periodic trends in metal surface oxidation resulting from interaction with nitric oxide and subsequent adsorbate reaction chemistry across the late 3d transition-metal series with surface-sensitive ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and density functional theory calculations. Metals with open d-shell orbitals (e.g., Fe, Co) favor stabilization of nitric oxide dissociation products (nitrogen adatoms, N*), while metals having near (e.g., Ni) or completely (e.g., Cu) closed d shells promote nitric oxide oxidation toward nitrite and lower total nitrogen and N* coverage. Adsorbate core-level (O 1s and N 1s) binding energies capture electron localization around nitrogen, and eventually oxygen, as nitric oxide moves toward dissociation. Metal-nitride covalency increases with decreasing transition metal electronegativity, where nitrogen adatom binding energies decrease as the transition metal d-band is pushed toward the Fermi level. This work illustrates experimental and theoretical relationships between the nature of the d-band in facilitating nitric oxide adsorption and dissociation chemistry, furthering fundamental understanding of the role of metal electronic structure in determining catalytically relevant adsorption properties.

We present new quantum dynamical results for the reactive scattering of hydrogen molecules from a Cu(111) surface at a surface temperature of 925 K. Reaction, scattering, and diffraction probabilities are compared for results obtained using both an effective Hartree potential (EfHP) and a sudden approximation approach, implemented through the static corrugation model (SCM), to include surface temperature effects. Toward this goal, we show how the SRP48 DFT-functional and an embedded atom potential perform when used to calculate copper lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients based on lattice dynamics calculations within the quasi-harmonic approximation. The so-calculated phonons are then used in the EfHP approach to replace the normal modes of a fictitious copper cluster used in earlier work. We find that both the EfHP and SCM approaches correctly predict the reaction probability curve broadening effect when the surface temperature is increased. Similarly, results for rovibrationally elastic scattering appear to be improved, predominantly for the SCM model. The behavior of the EfHP results appears to remain much closer to that of a Born–Oppenheimer static surface approach, which excludes any surface temperature effects. Finally, for the diffraction, we show very clear attenuation effects for the SCM approach, significantly decreasing specular diffraction probabilities at 925 K surface temperature. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art theoretical models are able to reproduce strictly quantum mechanical scattering effects with a sudden approximation model and open up interesting opportunities for further comparisons to experimental diffraction results.

Abstract Efficient and robust electrocatalysts play a central role in clean energy conversion, enabling a number of sustainable processes for future technologies. The traditional explorations of electrocatalyst relying on the trial‐and‐error approaches are definitely tedious and inefficient. Theoretical progresses on reactive thermodynamics and kinetics in recent years have initiated a powerful theory‐guided design strategy of electrocatalysts. Herein, this review first summarizes design principles for reactive activity and stability, presenting the thermodynamics, kinetics, and the synergistic thermokinetic correlation in electrocatalytic reaction. Second, the screening criterion, reasonable design, mechanistic understanding, and performance evaluation of the typical electrocatalysts as divided into the thermodynamics oriented‐, kinetics oriented‐, and thermokinetic correlation oriented‐designs are discussed. The necessity of correlating thermodynamics and kinetics into the rational design and mechanism clarification is highlighted. Finally, the conclusions and perspectives of the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts are proposed.

The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) under ambient conditions is a promising method to generate ammonia (NH3), a crucial precursor for fertilizers and chemicals, without carbon emissions. Single-atom alloy catalysts (SAACs) have reinvigorated catalytic processes due to their high activity, selectivity, and efficient use of active atoms. Here, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations integrated with machine learning (ML) to investigate dodecahedral nanocluster-based SAACs for analyzing structure–activity relationships in eNRR. Over 300 nanocluster-based SAACs were screened with all the transition metals as dopants to develop an ML model predicting stability and catalytic performance. Facet sites were identified as optimal doping positions, particularly with late group transition metals showing superior stability and activity. Utilizing DFT+ML, we identified 8 highly suitable SAACs for eNRR. Interestingly, the number of valence d-electrons in dopants proved crucial in screening for eNRR activity. These catalysts exhibited low activity in hydrogen evolution reaction, further enhancing their suitability for eNRR. This successful ML-driven approach accelerates catalyst design and discovery, holding significant practical implications.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to sustainable energy and environmental engineering, thus necessitating rational design of high-performing electrocatalysts that requires understanding the structure-performance relationship with a possible dynamic nature under working conditions. Herein, we uncover a novel type of OER mechanisms thrust by the fleeting active sites (FASs) dynamically formed on Ni-based layered double hydroxides (Ni-LDHs) by Fe cations from the electrolyte under OER potentials. We employ grand-canonical ensemble methods and microkinetic modeling to elucidate the potential-dependent structures of FASs on Ni-LDHs and demonstrate that the fleeting-active-site-thrust (FAST) mechanism delivers superior OER activity via the FAST intramolecular oxygen coupling pathway, which also suppresses the lattice oxygen mechanism, leading to improved operando stability of Ni-LDHs. We further reveal that introducing only trace-level loadings (10-100 ppm) of FASs on Ni-LDHs can significantly boost and govern the catalytic performance for OER. This underscores the crucial importance of considering the novel FAST mechanism in OER and also suggests the electrolyte as a key part of the structure-performance relationship as well as an effective design strategy via engineering the electrolyte.

NiFe-based nanomaterials have emerged as highly promising catalysts to replace platinum, ruthenium and iridium for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in “green hydrogen” production process through water splitting. Using iron (2+) sulfate and nickel acetate as the raw materials, with the molar ratio of Ni acetate to iron (2+) sulfate controlled at 8:5, the concentration of metal-ion was 0.6 mol/L, and precursor fibers rich in Ni2+, Fe2+, and SO4 2− were prepared using electrospinning technology, with polyvinyl alcohol acting as the colloid. Subsequently, composite nanorods rich in the elements of Ni, Fe, S, and C were successfully obtained at a heat treatment temperature of 1000°C in an Ar gas atmosphere. The results demonstrate that the nanorod samples possessed a surface diameter of ~200 nm, and the main phases of the nanorods after heat treatment at 1000°C included FeNi3 alloy, (Fe,Ni)9S8, Ni4S3, and amorphous C. Electrochemical performance tests conducted in a 1.0 mol/L KOH solution exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction properties of the catalysts prepared using FeNi3/(Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni4S3/C nanorods as the materials. The overpotential was about 258.6 mV of the catalyst material at 10 mAcm−2.

Shape-controlled alloy nanoparticle catalysts have been shown to exhibit improved performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in liquid half-cells. However, translating the success to catalyst layers in fuel cells faces challenges due to the more demanding operation conditions in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Balancing durability and activity is crucial. Here, we developed a strategy that limits the atomic diffusion within surface layers, fostering the phase transition and shape retention during thermal treatment. This enables selective transformation of platinum-iron nanowire surfaces into intermetallic structures via atomic ordering at a low temperature. The catalysts exhibit enhanced MEA stability with 50% less Fe loss while maintaining high catalytic activity comparable to that in half-cells. Density functional calculations suggest that the ordered intermetallic surface stabilizes morphology against rapid corrosion and improves the ORR activity. The surface engineering through atomic ordering presents potential for practical application in fuel cells with shape-controlled Pt-based alloy catalysts.

Inorganic semiconductor materials are crucial for modern technologies, but their brittleness and limited processability hinder the development of flexible, wearable, and miniaturized electronics. The recent discovery of room-temperature plasticity in some inorganic semiconductors offers a promising solution, but the deformation mechanisms remain controversial. Here, we investigate the deformation of indium selenide, a two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductor with substantial plasticity. By developing a machine-learned deep potential, we perform atomistic simulations that capture the deformation features of hexagonal indium selenide upon out-of-plane compression. Unexpectedly, we find that indium selenide plastifies through a martensitic transformation; that is, the layered hexagonal structure is converted to a tetragonal lattice with specific orientation relationship. This observation is corroborated by high-resolution experimental observations and theory. It suggests a change of paradigm, where the design of new plastically deformable inorganic semiconductors can focus on compositions and structures that facilitate phase transformations, going beyond the conventional dislocation slip.

Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyser (PEMWE) possesses great significance for the production of high purity of hydrogen. To expedite the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that involved multiple electron–proton‐coupled process, efficient and stable electrocatalysts are highly desired. Currently, noble‐metal Ir‐based materials are the benchmark anode due to its corrosion‐resistant property and favourable combination of activity/stability. However, the large‐scale deployment of PEMWE is usually constrained due to the use of the scarcest element iridium. In this review, we disclose the current research progress towards the non‐iridium‐based electrocatalysts for OER in acidic media, and then summarize some typical oxides that possesses good catalytic performance. Besides, we also present the unresolved problems and challenges in an attempt to enhance the activity/stability of these catalysts.

Abstract Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, has been utilised in many engineering fields, such as computer engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering petroleum engineering. Bagging ensemble algorithms have been employed for parameter prediction, as they theoretically outperform traditional ML algorithms. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a strategy implemented to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. A vital aspect of CCS assessment is determining carbon storage capacity, which estimates the amount of CO2 that can be stored in the subsurface. Porosity is a critical parameter in calculating this capacity. In this study, the applicability of regression friendly bagging ensemble ML models; random forest regression (RFR) and extra tree regression (ETR) to estimate porosity of a sandstone layer as part of a CCS program was investigated. RFR models were developed considering caliper log (CAL), gamma ray log (GR), neutron log (NPHI), photoelectric factor log (PE) and deep laterolog (LLD) input features and calculated porosity as targets. Moreover, four traditional (classical) ML models, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and decision tree regression (DTR), were developed to compare them with the bagging ensemble models. The results showed that the RFR model achieved a testing model R2 value of 0.9668, while ETR model achieved a resting model R2 value of 0.9569. The higher R2 value of the RFR model makes it a better choice for predicting porosity in CCS assessment projects. However, if computational time is a critical factor, ETR could be preferable, as it required only1/3 of the computational time that of the RFR model. Furthermore, when the performance of these models was compared with the four traditional ML models the two bagging ensembles distinctly outperformed the traditional models.
