The advent of machine learning (ML) models has unlocked new possibilities in the realm of interatomic potentials. An equivariant, graph neural network (NN), NequIP, recently developed by Batzner et al., [1,2] is utilized for a versatile system, CO on a NaCl(100) surface, to construct interatomic potentials and mediate efficient large-scale atomistic simulations with ab initio molecular dynamics accuracy. We report two neural network potentials, one trained on equilibrium configurations at finite temperatures (T = 30, 300 K), and the other additionally trained upon non-equilibrium trajectories of pre-excited CO adsorbates. We demonstrate first applications of the ML potentials for (i) adsorption energies and barriers for reactions, (ii) potential energy landscapes for submonolayer and monolayer coverages, (iii) vibrational spectra at finite temperatures as well as (iv) vibrational relaxation dynamics. Further possible applications are discussed.

Binary alloys of transition metals are promising catalytic materials for the cathodic oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) of polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, a lack of understanding of the factors that affect the ORR's catalytic performance hampers the catalytic applications of binary alloys. To obtain further knowledge of binary alloys for efficient ORR, we investigate the activity of monolayer AuxPt1-x alloy surfaces supported on Pt(111), considering from random distribution until phase-segregated surface atoms. Using the *OH adsorption energy as a descriptor, we found that the activity of monolayer binary alloy surfaces depends on the distribution of the surface atoms within surfaces with segregated Pt and Au domains showing higher activity. The adsorption energy of *OH increases with the fraction n of Au near the adsorption site and decreases with the fraction p of Au outside the heptamer. The energy increase due to n is related to a tensile strain, while the decrease with the increase of p is due to a long-range surface strain effect on the Pt-Pt and Pt-Au bonds, improving the activity of the available Pt adsorption sites. Due to the weak *OH adsorption energy on Au sites, an Au overall percentage considerably above the Pt percentage starts to reduce surface activity because of the reduction of the number of very active Pt sites.

Surface formation markedly influences the stability and properties of nanoalloys. The surface states of nanoalloys are sensitive to the constituent elements and to the surrounding environment. In this study, Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and an evolution strategy (ES) combined with density functional theory calculations and multivariate analysis were used to explore the stable configuration of NO-adsorbed PdRu nanoalloys. FT-IR analysis indicated that the NO molecules were adsorbed on the Ru-related sites, which was inconsistent with the stable surface state of the isolated PdRu nanoalloy models. The ES revealed that the stable surface state consisted mainly of Ru atoms owing to molecular adsorption. In addition, the Pd–Ru mixing was facilitated by the adsorption. According to the multivariate analysis, the adsorption energies on the Ru-related sites were more negative than those on the Pd-related sites and became more negative as the number of neighboring Pd atoms increased. These adsorption characteristics are opposite to those of the stability of the isolated PdRu nanoalloys. The energy gain owing to NO adsorption overcomes the energy loss due to the Pd–Ru bonds and placement of Ru atoms at the surface. This study highlights the importance of understanding stable surface states in a reactive atmosphere for the application of nanoalloys.

The hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is the anodic reaction of hydrogen–oxygen fuel cells, which plays a decisive role in the whole-device performance. However, inexpensive crude hydrogen inevitably contains carbon monoxide (CO) impurities, and even the state-of-the-art platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts can suffer an obvious activity decrease due to the poisoning of active sites, seriously hindering the efficiency of fuel cells. Developing electrocatalysts with promoted CO tolerance necessitates the elucidation of the HOR mechanism and deep understanding of the intrinsic nature of fuel cell poisoning. To date, weakening CO adsorption or accelerating its oxidation could improve the CO tolerance of the catalyst, so it is critical to seek much more effective strategies. Based on the study of the reaction mechanism, this Review summarizes the latest progress of HOR electrocatalysts with high stability and high activity against CO poisoning from two typical theories: hydrogen binding energy theory and bifunctional theory. The strategies for enhancing the CO tolerance of catalysts are gathered, including electronic structure modulation, oxophilic sites, and dual-site construction. In addition, the applications of catalysts in practical fuel cells is outlined. In conclusion, the discussion focuses on the challenges and future outlook of CO-tolerant HOR electrocatalysts, with the objective of offering distinct perspectives on the engineering design of HOR electrocatalysts with superior CO tolerance.

Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)‐based catalysts have garnered significant interest as efficient materials for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) due to their abundant availability, low cost, tunable electronic structures, and unique light absorption performance. This review offers a thorough examination of the latest developments in CoPc‐based catalysts for HER. It entails a wide range of synthesis approaches, intrinsic characteristics, and catalytic mechanisms associated with these catalysts for HER. We also compare the photo/electrocatalytic performance of these catalysts using parameters like Tafel slope, exchange current density, overpotential, hydrogen yield, turnover frequency, stability, specific surface area, etc. The review shows that the commonly used electrolytes for electrocatalytic HER are KOH, LiClO 4 /PBS, and H 2 SO 4 , while for photocatalytic HER, triethylamine, water, and triethanolamine are frequently used. Among all the electrocatalysts understudied, poly[CoOTPc]‐KB and GO/4N‐CoPc are the best, owing to their lowest overpotentials and Tafel slopes. In terms of photocatalytic hydrogen production, CoPc/TiO 2 /Pt has better photocatalytic HER performance compared to its counterparts. This review also highlights the effects of incorporating CoPc with different materials on the photo/electrocatalytic HER performance. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges and prospects, emphasizing the chances for improving and incorporating CoPc‐based catalysts as a viable option for hydrogen production in the future.

## CO2 Activation and Dissociation on Exsolved Ni/La2O3 Catalysts: A First-Principles Study

In this study, we performed spin-polarized periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the electronic structure and catalytic activity of exsolved Ni nanoparticles supported on La2O3 (i.e., Ni/La2O3) as reported in the recent experimental literature. We used simple slab models to study the electronic structure and reactivity of the Ni/La2O3 overlayer surfaces. The modifications in the electronic and geometric properties of Ni/La2O3 as successive layers of Ni are added on top of La2O3 are systematically investigated by using the d-band model as well as by studying the adsorption and dissociation of CO2. We examined the interaction of CO2 on the surface of Ni/La2O3 by computing adsorption energetics, optimized geometries, charge transfer, and density of states. As the interaction between CO2 and the Ni surface is weak, we employed van der Waal corrections in our calculations. Our results suggest that the adsorption of CO2 is more favorable on the Ni/La2O3 surface compared to that on the simple Ni(111) surface. Furthermore, we have also found that the activation barrier for CO2 dissociation increases with an increase in the number of Ni layers from one layer to three and that the energy of the reaction becomes less exothermic. This shows that the dissociation of CO2 becomes both kinetically and thermodynamically less favorable as we increase the number of Ni layers over La2O3. Thus, a single monolayer of Ni/La2O3 is the most active among the surfaces investigated here for the adsorption and dissociation of CO2. We show how this is due to the synergistic effect of geometric and electronic factors. The energetics of the CO2 dissociation reaction follow a Bro̷nsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship where the activation energy is linearly correlated to the reaction energy for all the surfaces studied here. The present study's findings offer valuable perspectives on the correlation between the electronic configuration and catalytic capabilities of Ni/La2O3 catalysts. Consequently, these insights are expected to be useful in the design of novel, high-performance, supported metal catalysts for a range of important reactions.

The conversion of molecular dinitrogen into ammonia under mild conditions is a significant pursuit in chemistry due to its potential for sustainable and clean ammonia production. The electrochemical reduction of N2 offers a promising route for achieving this goal with reduced energy consumption, utilizing renewable energy sources. However, the exploration of effective electrocatalysts for this process, particularly at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, remains under exploration. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation of potential catalysts for nitrogen electro-reduction to ammonia under ambient conditions. Using density functional theory calculations, we explore the (110) facets of rock salt structures across 11 transition metal carbides. Catalytic activity is evaluated through the construction of free energy diagrams for associative, dissociative, and Mars–van Krevelen reaction mechanisms. Additionally, we assess material stability against electrochemical poisoning and decomposition of parent metals during operation. Our findings suggest that a few of the candidates are promising for nitrogen reduction reactions, such as TaC and WC, with moderate onset potentials (−0.66 V and −0.82 V vs. RHE) under ambient conditions.

Abstract Designing novel catalysts is pivotal for overcoming numerous energy and environmental challenges. Although data science approaches, particularly machine learning (ML) approaches, hold promise for accelerating catalyst development, discovering truly novel catalysts through ML remains rare. This is largely due to the perceived inability of the ML models to extrapolate and identify exceptional materials. In this Review, I present our approach taken to tackle this limitation. Specifically, we employed an advanced ML methodology that could make extrapolative predictions. This approach led to the discovery of multielemental solid catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CO. The results not only demonstrate the immense potential of ML in catalysis research but also set a new standard for the rapid development of high-performance catalysts.

Electrocatalytic water splitting to generate green H 2 with renewable energy inputs is attractive to relieve the environmental contamination and energy dilemma. Restricted by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and single functionality of cathode/anode catalysts, conventional overall water splitting (OWS) suffers from high overpotentials and respective synthesis of monofunctional electrocatalysts, leading to high cost. Moreover, the generated O 2 bears low value and its possible mixing with H 2 poses safety issues. In response, hybrid water splitting (HWS) that integrates hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with favorable oxidative upgrading reactions over bifunctional electrocatalysts can generate H 2 and value-added chemicals simultaneously with lower energy input and avoid the explosive H 2 /O 2 mixtures. Hence, this chapter focuses on the recent progress in bifunctional electrocatalyst–driven HWS for energy-saving coproduction of highly valuable chemicals and green H 2 . Firstly, the fundamentals of HER, OER, OWS, and HWS are introduced, followed by a discussion on the electrochemical reconstruction of bifunctional electrocatalysts during OWS and HWS. Next, the HWS based on bifunctional electrocatalysts is summarized, wherein the alternative oxidation reactions include upgrading of alcohol, aldehydes, amines, biomass, and plastic waste. Finally, a brief overview of current challenges and perspective for bifunctional electrocatalyst–driven HWS is discussed.

Abstract Bimetallic nickel‐iron based oxides are regarded as one of the most promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we show that the precursor metal salts can affect the OER activity of the resulting Ni/Fe oxide under the same hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Pure sulfate, pure nitrate and mixed sulfate/nitrate metal salts were used to fabricate NiFe based oxide materials and to study the importance of the precursor choice for the OER. The results show that the nature of the precursor used in the synthesis of the bimetallic nickel‐iron materials can influence different multi‐phase catalysts to form which effects the OER.

Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) is considered one of the most hazardous chemicals used in industrial plants. Even small exposures to HF can have fatal consequences if not promptly and properly treated. Various research teams have presented numerous substances with the objective of capturing or detecting toxic HF gas. In this study, we explore the impact of HF gas on a single layer of SnS by employing density functional theory (DFT). The interaction nature between the gas molecule and the adsorbent is elucidated by analyzing the related adsorption energy, electronic structure properties and differential charge transfer. The findings indicate that HF is physically adsorbed on the pristine SnS with an adsorption energy value of -0.63 eV. By introducing a Sn mono vacancy defect, the modification of SnS enhances the adsorption energy to -1.26 eV, resulting in a chemisorption process. Molecular fluorine (F2) was discovered to undergo a barrierless reaction with SnS, resulting in the formation of fluorine-substituted SnS. It has been discovered that the substitution of fluorine atoms enhances the reactivity of SnS towards hydro- gen fluoride gas. The adsorption potential of the studied structures towards HF gas was determined to be in the following order: F2SnS > VSn-SnS > VS-SnS ∼ SnS. The current study is anticipated to offer new molecular insights that could lead to the creation of innovative devices for detecting or eliminating HF toxic gas from a specific atmosphere.

Abstract Perovskite oxides are considered highly promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to their low cost and adaptable electronic structure. However, modulating the electronic structure of catalysts without altering their nanomorphology is crucial for understanding the structure‐property relationship. In this study, a simple plasma bombardment strategy is developed to optimize the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides. Experimental characterization of plasma‐treated LaCo 0.9 Fe 0.1 O 3 (P‐LCFO) reveals abundant oxygen vacancies, which expose numerous active sites. Additionally, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X‐ray absorption fine structure analyses indicate a low Co valence state in P‐LCFO, likely due to the presence of these oxygen vacancies, which contributes to an optimized electronic structure that enhances OER performance. Consequently, P‐LCFO exhibits significantly improved OER catalytic activity, with a low overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , outperforming commercial RuO 2 . This work underscores the benefits of plasma engineering for studying structure‐property relationships and developing highly active perovskite oxide catalysts for water splitting.

The treatment of highly concentrated and recalcitrant organic pollutants in industrial wastewater has garnered significant attention, with Fenton oxidation emerging as a promising approach. However, traditional iron-based Fenton reagents present certain limitations, and copper-based Fenton systems are often less efficient. Thus, it is necessary to develop innovative copper-based Fenton catalytic materials. In this study, Cu₂O and Ag-modified activated carbon fibers (Cu₂O-Ag@ACF) were synthesized via liquid-phase reduction. The composition, structure, and morphology of Cu₂O-Ag@ACF were systematically characterized. The Cu₂O-Ag@ACF was employed as a functionalized cathode in the electro-Fenton process to degrade a highly concentrated organic pollutant solution, with methylene blue serving as a model contaminant. The loading of Cu₂O and Ag not only enhances the electrochemical performance of ACF but also improves its Fenton oxidation efficiency. Cu₂O-Ag@ACF exhibitd less than 1% performance degradation after five cycles of use, highlighting its potential for industrial applications under simulated realistic conditions. Moreover, the electro-Fenton system parameters, including current density, pH, electrode spacing, and solution temperature, were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the degradation rate of methylene blue by Cu₂O-Ag@ACF reached 92.8% within 120 minutes. Kinetic analysis indicated that the reaction followed a first-order kinetic model, with a rate constant of 0.253 min⁻¹. Furthermore, this study revealed that trace silver doping significantly accelerated the generation of reactive oxygen species, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the Cu-based Fenton-like catalysts. In conclusion, this work presents a convenient strategy for the sustainable and efficient purification of industrial wastewater, contributing to the improvement of human life quality.

The bigger pictureChallenges and opportunities:•The scarcity of active sites limits the large-scale application of metal oxides as commercial oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. However, the rational design of defect structures can boost their catalytic activity•The precise design of catalyst defect structures requires a comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationship between defects and OER performance. Current research primarily focuses on the correlation between defects and thermodynamic parameters. However, our understanding of the intrinsic relationship between defects and the kinetics and mechanisms of OERs remains limited•In the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), defect structures can accelerate the evolution of active surfaces, promote OH⁻ adsorption and deprotonation, and facilitate the desorption of the product O₂. In the lattice oxygen intermediate mechanism (LOM), defect structures can enhance the covalency of metal–oxygen bonds and provide OH⁻ adsorption sites, facilitating their involvement in lattice oxygen oxidation processesSummaryThe development of electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis for hydrogen production and rechargeable metal-air batteries, offers promising solutions to the energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, challenges like sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and scarce active sites in transition metal oxides hinder large-scale commercial applications. Defect engineering has emerged as a promising strategy to optimize transition metal oxides by improving their electronic structure, conductivity, and active site availability. Early research focused on static thermodynamic parameters, such as impedance, overpotential, and band gap, neglecting dynamic factors like catalyst surface restructuring and mechanism transformation during reactions. This perspective highlights the intrinsic connection between defect structures, catalyst surface reconstruction, and reaction mechanisms. It also discusses the need for advanced experimental and theoretical computational studies to better understand the surface evolution of catalysts during OERs.Graphical abstract    

    

## Addressing accuracy by prescribing precision: Bayesian error estimation of point defect energetics

With density functional theory (DFT), it is possible to calculate the formation energy of charged point defects and in turn to predict a range of experimentally relevant quantities, such as defect concentrations, charge transition levels, or recombination rates. While prior efforts have led to marked improvements in the accuracy of such calculations, comparatively modest effort has been directed at quantifying their uncertainties. However, in the broader DFT research space, the development of Bayesian Error Estimation Functionals (BEEF) has enabled uncertainty quantification (UQ) for other properties. In this paper, we investigate the utility of BEEF as a tool for UQ of defect formation energies. We build a pipeline for propagating BEEF energies through a formation-energy calculation and test it on intrinsic defects in several materials systems spanning a variety of chemistries, bandgaps, and crystal structures, comparing to prior published results where available. We also assess the impact of aligning to a deep-level transition rather than to the VBM (valence band maximum). We observe negligible dependence of the estimated uncertainty upon a supercell size, though the relationship may be obfuscated by the fact that finite-size corrections cannot be computed separately for each member of the BEEF ensemble. Additionally, we find an increase in estimated uncertainty with respect to the absolute charge of a defect and the relaxation around the defect site without deep-level alignment, but this trend is absent when the alignment is applied. While further investigation is warranted, our results suggest that BEEF could be a useful method for UQ in defect calculations.

Our study presents significant advancements in the handling of multimodal data through an extended Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. By integrating advanced embedding techniques, efficient retrieval mechanisms, and robust generative capabilities, our model demonstrates notable improvements in retrieval accuracy, real-time efficiency, generative quality, and scalability. The retrieval accuracy of our model reached 85%, showing a 10% improvement over existing benchmarks. Furthermore, the retrieval time was reduced by 40%, enhancing real-time application performance. The model's generative quality was also significantly improved, with BLEU and ROUGE scores increasing by 15% and 12%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and its applicability to various AI applications, including information retrieval, recommendation systems, and content creation. Future research directions include the integration of additional modalities and further optimization of retrieval mechanisms to broaden the applicability of our model.

Predicting the error in density functional theory (DFT) calculations due to the choice of exchange-correlation (XC) functional is crucial to the success of DFT, but currently, there are limited options to estimate this a priori. This is particularly important for high-throughput screening of new materials. In this work, the structure and elastic properties of binary and ternary oxides are computed using four XC functionals: LDA, PBE-GGA, PBEsol, and vdW-DF with C09 exchange. To analyze the systemic errors inherent to each XC functional, we employed materials informatics methods to predict the expected errors. The predicted errors were also used to better the DFT-predicted lattice parameters. Our results emphasize the link between the computed errors and the electron density and hybridization errors of a functional. In essence, these results provide "error bars" for choosing a functional for the creation of high-accuracy, high-throughput datasets as well as avenues for the development of XC functionals with enhanced performance, thereby enabling the accelerated discovery and design of new materials.

Deployment of post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technologies is needed to reduce emissions from power and industrial sources. Comparisons between existing thermochemical CO2 capture methods and emerging electrochemical concepts can help contextualize the promise of these new approaches. Here, we investigate the required absorber sizes for three capture systems: amine scrubbing using monoethanolamine (MEA), direct electrochemical (redox-active sorbent), and indirect electrochemical (pH-swing). For the electrochemical systems, we study how column size varies as a function of molecular properties and operating conditions, finding that parameters most closely related to CO2 uptake rates (i.e., rate constants and pKa) have the greatest impact. Through a Monte Carlo analysis, we find that the direct process can be designed to have column sizes similar to the thermochemical process, however, the CO2 uptake rate in the indirect process is too slow to enable smaller columns. Broadly, this work connects system input parameters to absorber performance for electrochemical CO2 capture and provides a foundation for technoeconomic and engineering analyses.

As demand for more efficient processes keeps rising and more restrictive environmental legislation requires higher levels of both yield and purity, the process industry has now, more than ever, been looking for new ways to achieve these goals. One approach has been the implementation of Process Intensification (PI). PI aims to combine multiple unit operations into a single one, promoting efficiency gains on multiple levels. This combination, however, leads to complex process dynamics, and controlling such processes, particularly when setup as multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, presents a great challenge due to highly interactive complex process dynamics and the imposition of many operating constraints. The objectives of this research are to generate first-principles and data-driven water-gas shift membrane reactor (WGS-MR) models and to create predictive control schemes to perform effective setpoint tracking under a MIMO framework. The AVEVA Process Simulation platform is chosen for simulating the first-principles model and both Gaussian Processes using a Squared Exponential kernel (GP-SE) and Bayesian Smoothing Spline Analysis of Variance (BSS-ANOVA) are explored as possible frameworks for data-driven models. A Proportional–Integral– Derivative (PID) controller is created as a benchmark and a Quadratic Dynamic Matrix Controller (QDMC) is developed for advanced control of the system. The GP model is later used as a digital twin of the plant for calculating a control action trajectory that could be applied to the physical system in case of a desired setpoint change. The results demonstrate the superiority of the BSS-ANOVA model over the GP-SE, especially under open-loop simulation conditions. Also, both PID and QDMC perform well under the tested conditions, but the QDMC is able to deliver smoother control action, specially under noisy signals. Finally, when operating under closed-loop control, the BSS-ANOVA model is capable of providing a good representation of one of the variables being studied, namely carbon capture, with Integral of the Absolute Error (IAE) values ranging from 0.39 to 12.6, while creating a fit for the other variable, namely hydrogen recovery, with IAE measurements ranging from 3.71 to 26.7. These results indicate that the proposed framework is viable, although not universal, as each variable desired to be modeled and controlled should be tested and have its viability carefully assessed.

Anion-exchange membranes (AEMs), known for enabling the high conductivity of hydroxide anions through dense polymeric structures, are pivotal components in fuel cells, electrolyzers, and other important electrochemical systems. This paper unveils an unprecedented utilization of AEMs in an electrochemical oxygen separation process, a new technology able to generate enriched oxygen from an O2/N2 mixture using a small voltage input. We demonstrate a first-of-its-kind AEM-based electrochemical device that operates under mild conditions, is free of liquid electrolytes or sweep gases, and produces oxygen of over 96% purity. Additionally, we develop and apply a one-dimensional time-dependent and isothermal model, which accurately captures the unique operational dynamics of our device, demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data, and allows us to explore the device's potential capabilities. This novel technology has far-reaching applications in many industrial processes, medical oxygen therapy, and other diverse fields while reducing operational complexity and environmental impact, thereby paving the way for sustainable on-site oxygen generation.

Abstract Regulating the adsorption of an intermediate on an electrocatalyst by manipulating the electron spin state of the transition metal is of great significance for promoting the activation of inert nitrogen molecules (N 2 ) during the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR). However, achieving this remains challenging. Herein, a novel 2D/2D Mott–Schottky heterojunction, Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P, is developed as an eNRR catalyst. This is achieved through the in situ growth of cobalt sulfide (Co 9 S 8 ) nanosheets over a Nb 2 CT x MXene using a solution plasma modification method. Transformation of the Co spin state from low (t 2g 6 e g 1 ) to high (t 2g 5 e g 2 ) is achieved by adjusting the interface electronic structure and sulfur vacancy of Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P. The adsorption ability of N 2 is optimized through high spin Co(II) with more unpaired electrons, significantly accelerating the *N 2 →*NNH kinetic process. The Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P exhibits a high NH 3 yield of 62.62 µg h −1 mg cat. −1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 30.33% at −0.40 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m HCl. Additionally, it achieves an NH 3 yield of 41.47 µg h −1 mg cat. −1 and FE of 23.19% at −0.60 V versus RHE in 0.1 m Na 2 SO 4 . This work demonstrates a promising strategy for constructing heterojunction electrocatalysts for efficient eNRR.

This study explores adult migrants’ formal and informal opportunities for learning their host country’s dominant language: specifically, the availability, accessibility, and effects of these opportunities on the migrants’ social integration. It prioritizes the migrants’ experience by reporting findings obtained from analyses of questionnaire data collected from 76 migrants in Canada, the United States, and Italy and from interview data collected from a subset of 18 of these migrants. The findings are supplemented by analyses of questionnaire data collected from 12 service providers at the same research sites. The findings show that across the three sites, adult migrants value both formal and informal learning opportunities; that in both learning contexts they prioritize the development of communicative competence, particularly speaking and listening skills; and that outside the classroom they prefer to interact with locals who do not share their home language, and find these interactions very useful in their social integration efforts. However, the findings also reveal that the migrants are not always able to choose freely to engage in the kinds of language learning opportunities that would help them meet their language learning or social integration goals because these opportunities may be unavailable, inaccessible, or insufficiently designed to meet their needs.
