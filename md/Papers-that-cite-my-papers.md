Abstract Ruthenium‐based catalysts have emerged as cost‐effective and active alternatives to iridium‐based materials for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. However, their widespread application is constrained by poor stability under high current densities. Herein, an uncoordinated single‐site Ru catalyst embedded within spinel Co 3 O 4 lattice is developed, delivering a current density of 3.0 A cm − 2 at 2.02 V with an ultra‐low loading of 13.8 µg Ru cm − 2 and excellent durability over 300 h at 0.7 A cm − 2 . Notably, a low energy consumption of 46.1 kW h kg −1 H 2 with an ultralow noble metal cost of 2.1 $ m − 2 is achieved, far exceeding commercial RuO 2 (48.6 kW h kg − 1 H 2 and 2280 $ m − 2 ) and most reported Ir‐based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal strong electronic metal–support interactions (EMSI) between Ru single site and Co 3 O 4 effectively modulate the Ru electronic structure and simultaneously activate adjacent Co sites, lowering the OER energy barrier for activity enhancement. Additionally, the EMSI imparts the catalyst with redox reversibility and structural flexibility, mitigating subsurface oxygen loss and suppressing over‐oxidation and dissolution of both Ru and Co for sustaining stability. This work provides a promising design strategy for advanced Ru‐based catalysts as promising alternatives to IrO 2 for PEM water electrolysis.

Abstract This study reports the application of electrodeposited graphene oxide (GO)‐modified nickel mesh electrodes (GO@Ni‐m) as efficient electrodes for direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC). GO@Ni‐m50 (50 cyclic voltammetry cycles) exhibited the best electrocatalytic activity, achieving a (current density ∼15.37 mA cm −2 and onset potential 0.45 V versus Hg/HgO) at 1 M ethanol in 0.1 M KOH, due to improved surface area, conductivity, excellent stability, and low charge transfer resistance (R ct ≈ 4.5 Ω·cm 2 ). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a direct mechanism of ethanol electrooxidation to acetaldehyde, at an adsorption energy of −0.77 eV on GO@Ni‐m50, due to the synergism of GO and Ni‐m. Further surface modification with iron‐nickel (FeNi) and platinum‐carbon (Pt/C) nanoparticles revealed contrasting effects with reduced current densities due to hindered electron mobility through GO layers. Next, the electrooxidation of bioethanol (derived from potato peel fermentation) resulted in a current density of >10 mA cm −2 , confirming its practical applicability in bioethanol driven alkaline fuel cells. The GO@Ni‐m50 platform demonstrates high efficiency for ethanol and bioethanol oxidation and holds promise for other biomass‐derived alcohol fuels. The future studies on enhancing long‐term durability of the electrodes can enrich their applicability in sustainable electrochemical energy conversion systems.

The surface structure of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 film, a typical model water-splitting catalyst, is examined under vacuum and electrochemical conditions using surface X-ray diffraction. The pristine sample has a two-unit-cell-thick strongly polarized SrCoO3 layer at the surface, and the surface termination is predominantly a CoO2 layer with apical oxygen atoms. After electrochemical treatment, the surface was covered with an additional edge-shared CoO6 double layer. The polarization in the SrCoO3 region was greatly reduced. These structural changes were accompanied by an increase in the working electrode current, suggesting a strong relationship between surface structure modulation and catalytic activity. Reversible structural modulation induced by the film's electric potential was observed and was qualitatively understood as atomic displacements caused by the local electric field and change in the Co ionic radii.

The free-atom-like character of dopant d-states is a defining feature of single-atom alloys (SAAs), contributing to their exceptional selectivity and activity in heterogeneous catalysis. Based on reliable density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the full series of 4d transition metal (TM) dopants embedded in various hosts, we provide a unified perspective on when dopants exhibit this characteristic and how it can be tuned. Only late TM dopants exhibit the narrow, free-atom-like d-bands typically associated with SAAs, whereas early TM dopants display significantly broader d-bands that approach the width of host metal d-bands. This variation is not driven by increased dopant–host d-state mixing, which remains minimal across the series. Instead, we attribute the observed periodic trend to differences in the spatial extent of the localized dopant states and their overlap with surrounding host atoms, as well as to avoided hybridization associated with d-state filling. We further corroborate that dopant confinement, quantified by the number and proximity of surrounding host atoms, is as a key factor: more confined dopants exhibit broader d-bands, whereas less confined dopants feature narrower d-bands. Reduced dopant confinement also stabilizes high-spin configurations, enhancing spin polarization for certain 4d elements. Together, these findings offer fundamental insights into the origins of the unique electronic structure of SAAs. Building on these findings, we establish design principles for tuning dopant d-band shape and spin and illustrate how such modifications impact catalytic selectivity. The developed guidelines are also encapsulated in a machine learning model that predicts d-band widths, facilitating the rational design of SAAs.

Abstract Electrocatalysis is a crucial approach for achieving clean energy transitions, requiring highly efficient catalytic materials to expedite this process. However, overcoming the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints is key to discovering next‐generation materials that are both cost‐effective and efficient. The introduction of magnetic fields offers new opportunities for modulating the electronic structures of catalytic materials, optimizing the adsorption/desorption behavior of key intermediates, and enhancing catalytic efficiency. This review starts with the fundamental principles of classical electrocatalytic reactions, and revisits the main mechanisms by which magnetic fields affect magnetic catalytic materials and electrocatalytic systems, including magneto‐thermal effects, magnetohydrodynamic effects, and spin‐selective effects. Focusing on amorphous materials, topological materials, and metal oxides, the review highlights the design of magnetic catalytic materials, the control of magnetic structures, and their response behaviors to external fields. Finally, it discusses the major bottlenecks facing magnetic catalysis and its potential applications in other important small molecule catalytic transformations. This review provides a new perspective for understanding the essence of magnetic field chemistry and accelerating the development of catalytic materials aimed at applications.

Abstract The catalytic role and function of acid sites in solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites, are well understood in the context of heterogeneous catalytic reactions. But although many studies have highlighted the importance of acid sites, their catalytic effects in electrocatalytic reactions have rarely been investigated. In this work, a novel catalyst synthesis strategy is developed, integrating metal sites with acid sites for application in the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (EGOR). Specifically, an ordered microporous carbon support containing acidic aluminum sites (AlYTC) is prepared through a nanocasting approach using a sacrificial zeolite template. Platinum (Pt) nanoclusters are then deposited onto the AlYTC support, forming a structure that exposes both acid sites and Pt nanoclusters on a zeolite‐templated 3D carbon framework (PtAlYTC). The prepared PtAlYTC catalyst demonstrates a turnover frequency (TOF, s −1 ) 30 times higher and a reaction rate () 17 times greater than those of a Pt catalyst lacking acid sites (PtYTC) in the EGOR. First‐principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the combination of Pt sites and acidic Al sites lowers the Gibbs free energy of key reaction steps, improves charge transfer, and strengthens hydrogen adsorption, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic performance in EGOR.

Strain is a widely used strategy for electrocatalyst engineering. Overstraining, however, can lead to unintentional materials transformation. We investigate the impact of strain on the surface morphology of a rutile RuO2(110) film grown on a symmetry-matching rutile TiO2(110) substrate. When the film thickness exceeds 9 nm, the RuO2 surface relaxes by forming step edges that expose the {011} plane. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the (011) facet is among the lower energy surfaces of rutile RuO2, suggesting that this formation incurs minimal energetic penalties. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the film maintains the (110) structure of the terrace during electrochemistry. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) further reveals the insensitivity of the Ru dissolution to strain. Our findings show a strain-relieving pathway via surface reconstruction in RuO2(110) and provide an example of a strain-relieving mechanism that does not affect dissolution.

Abstract It is desirable but challenging to develop low‐cost and high‐performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in zinc–air batteries (ZABs) applications. In this work, a series of cerium oxide‐coated cobalt vanadium oxide nanoplates (denoted as CVO@CeO 2 ) are prepared using different CeO 2 loadings through a facile two‐step method. Compared to bare CVO, CeO 2, and commercial RuO 2 , the CVO@CeO 2 ‐0.20 catalyst presents much higher activity toward OER in alkaline solutions. Moreover, the CVO@CeO 2 ‐0.20 also exhibits superior open‐circuit voltage and durability when utilized as the cathode in ZABs. Both theoretical calculations and experimental results disclose that the decoration of CeO 2 on CVO not only regulates the formation of high‐spin state Co 3+ , optimizing the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway, but also activates lattice oxygen, enhancing the lattice oxide oxidation mechanism (LOM) pathway. This research presents the CVO@CeO 2 heterojunction as an excellent catalyst for the OER and proposes a promising interface‐regulated strategy for developing catalysts based on the reinforcement of AEM and LOM mechanisms.

Abstract In this study, we employ the pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL) to tailor the surface properties of cobalt (II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) platelets grown in the < 111 > direction. By varying the laser intensity and pulse number, we systematically investigate the relationship between defect formation and catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and selective oxidation of two alcohols. Our results reveal that the PUDEL processing leads to the formation of lattice distortions, the gradual alteration of three different paramagnetic defect sites, a partial reduction of Co 3 O 4 , and enrichment of the Co 3 O 4 (111) surface with hydroxyl groups (*OH), which significantly enhances OER activity. Theoretical investigations confirm that optimized hydroxyl coverage is critical for determining OER activity. The observed trends in selectivity and conversion efficiency for the selective oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol (CA) and ethylene glycol (EG) suggest different reaction mechanisms. The activity trend of the selective oxidation of CA appears to follow the trend of a defect‐attributed paramagnetic species that was assigned to a surface‐near, distorted high‐spin (S = 3/2) Co 2+ . In turn, the catalytic activity and OER activity trends for the EG oxidation showed similar trends, which followed the density of a paramagnetic CoO x species observed during EPR spectroscopy. In particular, the highest OER activity and EG conversion were both found for moderate (2 PPV, ), yet not too intense PUDEL processing. Our findings establish PUDEL as a precise method for catalyst optimization, both for thermal and electro‐catalytic oxidation over defect‐enriched cobalt oxides, which enables the correlation of specific laser‐induced defects with catalytic activity trends.

Abstract Understanding electrochemical interfaces at the atomic level is essential for optimizing catalytic performance in energy conversion and storage technologies. This study introduces a computational framework based on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to predict the potential of maximum entropy (PME) a descriptor of electric double layer disorder and charge transfer efficiency. By integrating AIMD with the generalized computational hydrogen electrode, it is systematically investigated how electrolyte composition, cation identity, and pH effect the position of PME. The approach reproduces experimental shifts in PME for Au and Pt electrodes and provides unprecedented insights into the emergence of multiple PME values in mixed‐cation systems. The findings challenge conventional models of electrolyte structuring by revealing the presence of multiple PME values within mixed‐cation systems. This suggests a more complex interplay between cations, adsorbates, and interfacial disorder than previously assumed. The computational framework developed in this study provides a predictive tool for understanding these interactions, offering new strategies for tuning electrocatalytic activity.

Abstract The existence of Cl − in seawater electrolysis weakens the selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and causes material failure by chlorine pitting. Introducing anion layers not only repels the transition of Cl − without retarding the diffusion of oxygen‐containing anions but also can be generated in situ on the outer surface. Here, a hierarchical catalyst consisting of a MnO 2 layer formed on a Ni foam substrate covered uniformly by a nickel‐iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe‐LDH) active layer is developed through interfacial electrostatic engineering. It was found that the introduced Lewis acid layer (MnO 2 ) can spontaneously generate OH − groups on the outer surface in situ to repel Cl − by electrostatic repulsion force. Meanwhile, Ni‐active sites anchored inside the MnO 2 matrix can improve the low activity of MnO 2 . The multilayer NiFe‐LDH@MnO 2 /NF anode can operate steadily at the current density of 100 mA cm −2 at 70 °C for 100 h and maintain 97.9% OER selectivity. Furthermore, the OER overpotential was reduced by 136 mV, superior to the state‐of‐the‐art commercial Ni mesh in industrial environments, especially the device can be powered by wind energy. The work offers an efficient strategy for designing high‐performance seawater electrolysis with low cost and high stability.

Abstract The development of cost‐effective catalysts for zinc–air batteries (ZABs) remain challenging due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) at the cathode. In this context, a novel N‐doped graphitic shell‐encapsulated cobalt catalyst is presented as an air electrode with exceptional bifunctional activity, achieving an ORR half‐wave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 0.81 V and an OER overpotential of 349 mV in an alkaline medium. The catalyst demonstrated excellent cycling durability and delivered superior power density in both liquid and solid‐state ZABs. Furthermore, a quasi‐solid‐state ZAB is assembled with the catalyst, and it maintained a stable open‐circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.360 V for >10 000 s. The catalyst achieved a peak power density of 127 mW cm −2 —significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C + RuO 2 system (74 mW cm −2 ). When two tandem‐junction ZABs are connected in series, they achieved an OCV of 2.75 V and powering a “ZAB” LED strip and a mini fan. Furthermore, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the enhanced performance resulted from optimized binding energies between the Co@N(py) active sites and reaction intermediates. An in situ Raman study is carried out to understand the catalytic mechanism through transient intermediate detection.

Abstract Development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for renewable energy storage and conversion technologies. While transition metal (TM) co‐doped N‐doped graphene systems (TM‐N‐G) are well‐known for their electrocatalytic performance, their bifunctional activity for both OER and ORR remains limited and inefficient. In this work, bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of TM‐N 6 ‐G systems (TM = Fe, Co, and Ni) is investigated by incorporating p‐block metals (PM = Al, Ga, In, Sn, and Bi) into an N 4 cavity, resulting in TM‐PM‐N 6 ‐G structures. Systematic DFT calculations reveal that among all the system configurations, Co‐Ga‐N 6 ‐G and Co‐Sn‐N 6 ‐G emerge as highly efficient bifunctional catalysts. The enhanced catalytic activity of Co centres is attributed to optimal interactions with reaction intermediates, as elucidated by scaling relations, volcano plots, and contour maps. These optimal interactions are explained by changes in electronic structure of catalysts and charge redistribution at the TM sites, induced by incorporated PMs. A new descriptor ϒ is proposed to describe the catalytic activity, performing better than conventional d‐band center. Additionally, several unifunctional catalysts are identified. This detailed analysis provides key insights and design strategies for developing high‐performance bifunctional catalysts via PM doping in TM‐N‐G systems.

The nitrite electroreduction reaction (NO2RR) offers a green and sustainable pathway for environmental wastewater treatment and ammonia (NH3) generation. Herein, defect-rich trimetallic AuCuRh nanowires (AuCuRh NWs) with a large number of grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and atomic steps are successfully synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction. Due to its self-stability and high activity, AuCuRh NWs can efficiently drive the stable NO2RR at 0 V potential (Faradaic efficiency: 98.32%, NH3 yield rate: 20.49 mg h-1 mgcat -1). Moreover, AuCuRh NWs also reveal excellent electrocatalytic activity for the formaldehyde electrooxidation reaction (FOR), which can reach 10 mA cm-2 at only 0.35 V potential. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system assembled with AuCuRh NWs requires only the electrolysis voltage of 0.38 V to achieve the co-production of NH3, formate, and hydrogen and ultra-stable continuous electrolysis for 300 hours. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system can be further decreased to only 0.29 V under illumination due to plasmon-enhanced activity. This study provides an energy-efficient coupling strategy for the stable co-production of value-added chemicals.

Axial ligand coordination plays a critical role in modulating the catalytic activity and selectivity of metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we systematically investigate FeN4, CoN4, and NiN4 active sites coordinated with a broad range of axial ligands to elucidate how ligand environments influence reaction energetics across different metal centers. Free energy analyses reveal that axial ligands can substantially modify key steps in the ORR pathway, including *OOH formation and *OH desorption, with distinct effects observed for each metal. FeN4 exhibits tunable activity and selectivity depending on the ligand, balancing between 4e− and 2e− pathways. CoN4 shows a pronounced preference toward the 2e− pathway under specific ligand environments, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production. In contrast, NiN4 displays generally high energy barriers and limited ORR activity across all axial ligands. These results establish a comparative framework for understanding how axial ligand coordination governs ORR performance and provide guidance for the rational design of M–N–C SACs with tailored activity and selectivity.

Understanding and predicting hydrogen adsorption energy is key to designing effective electrocatalysts. In this study, we develop a physically interpretable descriptor within a framework that decomposes atomic hydrogen adsorption energy into intuitive contributions, applied to 22 group IV and III–V 2D honeycomb materials. The density functional theory (DFT) calculated adsorption energy is decomposed into two components: bond energy, approximated by the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP), and the energy cost of forming the additional bond, termed distortion energy Ed. This decomposition facilitates analysis of adsorption trends beyond treating adsorption energy as a single quantity. We find that ICOHP correlates strongly with the adsorption site electronegativity (R2 = 0.86), improving to R2 = 0.91 when electronegativity differences and structural parameters are included. Ed shows moderate correlation with the unrelaxed vacancy energy Evac (R2 = 0.60) and can be accurately modeled (R2 = 0.92) using similar dependences on electronegativity and structural parameters. Notably, Evac can be expressed in terms of the sum of electronegativities, enabling a DFT-free formulation. Combining both components into an Eads descriptor, we achieve an R2 score of 0.82 across both group IV and III–V systems. Further analysis reveals that increasing the adsorption site electronegativity weakens adsorption unless the lattice constant is sufficiently large. In addition, we identify a linear relationship between ICOHP and the zero-point energy change, allowing the descriptor to be extended to the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, a key indicator of hydrogen evolution reaction activity.

Over the past two decades, the integration of machine learning (ML) into theoretical and computational chemistry has transformed the scale and scope of discovery that is possible on a computer. In this Perspective, I share my personal journey from early density functional theory method development for small transition metal complexes to the building of automated workflows and ML models for catalysis, redox chemistry, and materials design. I will describe my unlikely path toward machine learning starting from minimal models of catalysts and the use of structural databases to gain data-driven insights. I will then describe our experiences in training machine learning models for discovery, including active learning and descriptor-based approaches that enabled data-driven exploration despite limited experimental reference data for open-shell transition metal complexes. As an example of overcoming these limitations, I will describe our more recent efforts that culminated in experimental validation of our computational predictions. Along the way, challenges in data curation, DFT method sensitivity, and synthetic realism have shaped the trajectory of the field. I conclude with reflections on the rapid rise of generative AI, agentic workflows, and the enduring need to ask questions that truly advance molecular discovery.

High-throughput virtual screening campaigns are invaluable for surveying the combinatorial space of possible transition metal complexes (TMCs), but they rely on accurate metal–ligand connectivity for meaningful results. Here, we curate a dataset of 70,069 unique ligands of known coordination from experimental structures of TMCs deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database. Using this dataset, we train separate graph neural network models to predict the total number and individual identities of ligand coordinating atoms with high accuracy and precision. Interpreting each model in terms of the learned molecular representations uncovers trends aligned with our understanding of coordination chemistry as well as chemical insights. Next, we integrate the trained models with the high-throughput screening software molSimplify and illustrate their utility by generating 1,175 TMCs and validating their geometries with density functional theory calculations. We anticipate these models will accelerate computational screening of TMCs with de novo combinations of metals and ligands in physically realistic coordination.
