The development of effective catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for improving the performance of fuel cells. Efficient carbon-supported Pt-Co nanocatalysts were successfully prepared by a generic two-step method: (i) electroless deposition of a Co-P coating on Vulcan XC72R carbon powder and (ii) subsequent spontaneous partial galvanic replacement of Co by Pt, upon immersion of the Co/C precursor in a chloroplatinate solution. The prepared Pt-Co particles (of a core-shell structure) are dispersed on a Vulcan XC-72 support, forming agglomerates made of nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm. The composition and surface morphology of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crystal structures of the Co-P/C precursor and Pt-Co/C catalyst were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). XPS analysis was performed to study the chemical state of the surface layers of the precursor and catalyst. The electrochemical behavior of the Pt-Co/C composites was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments were used to assess the catalytic activity towards the ORR and compared with that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The Pt-Co/C catalysts exhibit mass-specific and surface-specific activities (of jm = 133 mA mg−1 and jesa = 0.661 mA cm−2, respectively) at a typical overpotential value of 380 mV (+0.85 V vs. RHE); these are superior to those of similar electrodes made of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (jm = 50.6 mA mg−1; jesa = 0.165 mA cm−2). The beneficial effect of even small (<1% wt.%) quantities of Co in the catalyst on Pt ORR activity may be attributed to an optimum catalyst composition and particle size resulting from the proposed preparation method.

Atomic-scale quantum conductance switches based on metallic quantum point contacts allow controlled binary switching of the electrical current between a conducting “on state” and a non-conducting “off state” via an independent gate electrode. Although silver-based quantum switches operate via electrochemical conductance modulation, the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed density functional theory combined with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) framework to investigate nitrate anion adsorption on Ag(100), Ag(111), and Ag(511) surfaces under varying electrochemical potentials. The stable configurations of nitrate adsorption on the electrode surfaces as a function of electrode potential are determined using the grand canonical approach within the CHE framework, revealing the surface reconstruction of Ag(511) analogous to the formation of nascent Ag–NO3 complexes. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that the critical phase transition occurs in agreement with the experimental switching threshold. Electronic structure calculations reveal metallic to semiconducting transitions in the reconstructed Ag–NO3 complex layers, elucidating the mechanism of conductance modulation. The “off state” corresponds to insulating Ag–NO3 surface complexes, while the “on state” arises from metallic Ag–Ag bridging at lower nitrate coverage under lower control voltage. This study establishes a general framework for anion-mediated quantum switching in transition metals and provides a design for nanoscale electrochemical devices.

ABSTRACT Broadband light absorption, mechanical resilience, and efficient surface catalysis are all crucial for photocatalytic semiconductors, yet they are rarely improved together in one material. We combine first‐principles calculations with machine‐learning interpretability and Pearson correlation analyses to reveal that rare‐earth (La, Er) doping of Mg₂Si can synergistically enhance its optoelectronic, mechanical, and hydrogen‐evolution performance. La doping introduces conduction‐band impurity states via La‐5d/Si‐3p orbital hybridization, boosting sub‐bandgap (infrared) absorption by 60‐fold (~0.6 × 10 5 cm −1 ) and extending the absorption edge into the near‐infrared—translating to a solar‐to‐hydrogen conversion efficiency of up to 39.86%. It also percolates a metallic bond network that doubles the Poisson's ratio (0.23 → 0.46), transforming Mg₂Si from brittle to ductile. Er doping, in contrast, localizes 4f orbitals, yielding exciton‐like absorption peaks (~10 5 cm −1 ) in the ultraviolet and inducing a distinct electronic and mechanical response. Both dopants push the Fermi level into the conduction band (degenerate n‐type doping), fundamentally altering carrier characteristics. Catalytically, La doping generates delocalized sp 3 d 2 orbitals that give near‐thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption (Δ G H* ≈ −0.04 eV), outperforming noble‐metal catalysts, whereas Er's extended electron density enhances H binding at the cost of slower H₂ desorption. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis further identifies the key orbital and elastic descriptors governing these trends, providing a mechanistic blueprint.

## Computational Electrosynthesis: A Perspective on Mechanistic Questions, Methodological Approaches, and Elucidating the Role of the Electrical Double Layer

In this perspective, we discuss how modern computational chemistry techniques are utilized to elucidate electrosynthesis reaction mechanisms via the computation of kinetic rate parameters that depend on reaction conditions. The specific focus is on elementary reaction steps that occur within the electrical double layer (EDL) environment at the working electrode/electrolyte interface, for which the governing free energy profiles and rate constants can be explicitly computed from classical molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computer simulations with atomistic resolution of the EDL environment. We focus on direct electrolysis reactions at inert electrodes with prototypical "E-C-E" mechanisms, in which the reaction yield and selectivity may depend on whether the full process occurs heterogeneously within the EDL, or rather the steps following the initial electron transfer proceed homogeneously with the second electron transfer occurring via disproportionation (DISP pathway). For short-lived radical intermediates with lifetimes of ∼10–10–10–7 s, branching between heterogeneous E-C-E and homogeneous DISP pathways is dictated by rate constants for substrate/intermediate desorption from the electrode surface (e.g., kD ∼ 107–1010 s–1), which are difficult to determine experimentally but can be computed from molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss how strong solvophobic forces within electrolytes lead to significant association free energies between electrogenerated radical ion intermediates and the working electrode surface, resulting in residence times within the EDL that are on par with time constants of fast radical ion reactions. For electrosynthesis reactions that proceed entirely heterogeneously, the EDL environment can substantially modulate the reaction kinetics via electrostatic, solvophobic, and steric forces. We present several case studies highlighting modulated reaction kinetics within the EDL for nucleophilic coupling and deprotonation reactions of cation radical intermediates in anodic electrosynthesis. We expect that computational techniques will play an increasingly valuable role in optimizing electrosynthesis reactions via mechanistic descriptions of how key kinetic rate parameters are modulated by electrochemical reaction conditions.

Hydrogen absorption and desorption in solids are pivotal reactions involved in batteries and hydrogen storage devices. However, conventional thermodynamic and electrochemical hydrogen storage using high-capacity materials suffers from high hydrogen-desorption temperatures and instability of electrolytes. In this work, we explored electrochemical hydride ion (H – )–driven hydrogen storage and developed a solid electrolyte, anti–α-AgI–type Ba 0.5 Ca 0.35 Na 0.15 H 1.85 , which exhibits excellent H – conductivity and electrochemical stability. This electrolyte is compatible with several metal-hydrogen electrodes, such as titanim hydride and magnesium hydride (MgH 2 ), allowing for high-capacity, reversible hydrogen storage at low temperatures. Specifically, Mg–H 2 cells operating as hydrogen storage devices (Mg + H 2  ⇄  MgH 2 ) achieved a reversible capacity of 2030 milliampere hours per gram at 90°C, offering safe and efficient hydrogen-electricity conversion and hydrogen storage devices.

A key challenge in modeling electrocatalysis with single-atom catalysts (SACs) is accurately capturing the redox behavior of transition metals across oxidation states. This is particularly true for iron, a widely used element in such systems. Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) serves as a model compound for graphene-based Fe SACs and is commonly used in reactions like the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While FePc initially contains Fe(II), the active species under oxidative conditions is Fe(III), with an Fe(II)/Fe(III) transition occurring at intermediate potentials. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations must reflect this redox change. However, standard DFT predicts that oxidation removes an electron from the ligand, leaving the iron in the II state. This limitation arises not from DFT itself, but from an incomplete model. We show that adding at least one (preferably two) water molecules to the axial coordination sites of iron corrects this issue. The water ligands raise the energy of iron orbitals, making electron removal from the metal more favorable. This finding has two key implications: (1) the redox properties of transition metal complexes and graphene-based SACs are strongly influenced by the coordination environment, including solvent molecules; and (2) accurate description of the atomistic structure of the catalyst requires the explicit inclusion of axial water ligands, not just the in-plane ligands, to capture the true redox behavior.    

    

## Reactivity of Carbonate Solvent Electrolytes on Lithium Silicon Anodes

Silicon (Si) is promising for lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes due to their high theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, significant challenges remain, including severe volumetric expansion during cycling and the electrochemical instability of electrolytes, which leads to the formation of a nonuniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). To investigate SEI formation mechanisms, computational molecular dynamics simulations offer valuable insights. In this study, we examine the trajectories and charge transfer behavior of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) salt with various solvent compositions using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). Among the tested electrolyte systems, LiPF6 with vinylene carbonate (VC) added to ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) exhibits the lowest reactivity with the Si anode. In contrast, the effects of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and VC depend on whether the primary solvent is EMC alone or a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and EMC. Moreover, we show that electrolyte reactivity varies with the degree of lithiation of the Si anode (LiSi vs Li15Si4) and under different charge states. To decouple electrolyte reactivity from surface effects, we analyze the dissociation and formation energies of individual species from solvated configurations. Overall, these first-principles-based findings provide a strategic foundation for electrolyte design to improve cycling stability and extend calendar life in LIBs using Si anodes.

In this study, six-dimensional (6D) time-dependent wave packet calculations were employed to investigate the dissociation of HCl molecules on two bimetallic surfaces, Cu/Ag(111) and Cu/Au(111). These calculations were based on two accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs) constructed using neural network methodology. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the static barrier heights for HCl on Cu/Ag(111) and Cu/Au(111) were 0.32 eV and 0.28 eV, respectively. These values are significantly lower than the barrier height on pure Cu(111) (0.52 eV), primarily due to surface strain effects. However, it was found that the 6D dissociation probability of HCl in (v=0, 1, j=0) states on Cu/Au(111) was considerably lower, despite its barrier height being 0.04 eV lower than that for Cu/Ag(111). The underlying mechanism for this observation was attributed to the non-monotonic dependence of the minimum energy path (MEP) on the molecular orientation, which was induced by charge transfer effect for HCl+Cu/Au(111). In contrast, HCl+Cu/Ag(111) exhibited a monotonic dependence. These contrasting behaviors led to distinct differences in rotational alignment and excitation effects for the two reactions.

Abstract A tandem electrocatalyst with dual‐active‐sites is anticipated to organize the coupling reaction between various intermediates from nitrate to ammonia. Herein, by engineering the metal nodes and ligands of Zr‐based metal–organic frameworks (Zr‐MOFs) with Fe‐porphyrins (Hemins) and diacetylene linkages, respectively, a tandem catalyst of diacetylene‐linked Zr–MOFs anchored Hemins has been achieved. The key point here is that the diacetylene linkages could serve as cofactors of Hemins to manage the nitrate to ammonia process via NO 2 − intermediates. In addition, the ultrathin Zr–MOFs nanosheet with a well‐defined open framework allows it to organize the shuttle diffusion and coupling reaction of various reactants between Hemins and diacetylene linkages in its deep interior. In detail, the NO 2 − desorbed from the Hemins could diffuse onto the diacetylene linkages to finish the following hydrogenation process to NH 3 . Therefore, such an ultrathin hybrid of diacetylene‐linked Zr–MOF@Hemin achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% with an ammonia yield of 240.9 µmol h −1 cm −2 at −0.5 V versus RHE. This work indicates the activity of diacetylene linkage in catalysis independent of graphdiyne‐based 2D structures by organizing it into the topological structure of Zr–MOFs, which expands the scope of graphdiyne in structure.

Abstract Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS) due to their high crystallinity, porosity and tunable structures. However, current COF‐based systems rely on cocatalysts, which suffer from low atomic utilization and poor distribution due to aggregation. In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) backward reaction severely undermines catalytic efficiency and stability in long time reaction. Herein, we present a strategy that combines atomically dispersed Pt sites anchored via N/O coordination within triazine‐based COFs and a gas‐liquid‐solid three‐phase interface‐assisted photocatalytic system to enhance both performance and durability. As a result, the Pt‐TBPyT‐COF achieves superior OWS performance with H 2 and O 2 evolution rates of 469.8 and 234.9 µmol·g −1 ·h −1 , respectively, and an apparent quantum yield of 8.91% at 450 nm. Notably, the OWS via gas‐liquid‐solid three‐phase interface‐assisted method effectively suppresses ORR backward reaction and reaches average rates as high as 568.7 and 284.3 µmol·g −1 ·h −1 for H 2 and O 2 in 5 h, respectively, and maintained stable photocatalytic activity over a 30 h continuous reaction. Further, density functional theory calculations and in situ experiments reveal that the single‐atoms Pt coordination accelerates *H desorption, while the triazine units in COFs benefits charge separation and reduced energy barriers of OER rate‐determining step.

Abstract Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS) due to their high crystallinity, porosity and tunable structures. However, current COF‐based systems rely on cocatalysts, which suffer from low atomic utilization and poor distribution due to aggregation. In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) backward reaction severely undermines catalytic efficiency and stability in long time reaction. Herein, we present a strategy that combines atomically dispersed Pt sites anchored via N/O coordination within triazine‐based COFs and a gas‐liquid‐solid three‐phase interface‐assisted photocatalytic system to enhance both performance and durability. As a result, the Pt‐TBPyT‐COF achieves superior OWS performance with H 2 and O 2 evolution rates of 469.8 and 234.9 µmol·g −1 ·h −1 , respectively, and an apparent quantum yield of 8.91% at 450 nm. Notably, the OWS via gas‐liquid‐solid three‐phase interface‐assisted method effectively suppresses ORR backward reaction and reaches average rates as high as 568.7 and 284.3 µmol·g −1 ·h −1 for H 2 and O 2 in 5 h, respectively, and maintained stable photocatalytic activity over a 30 h continuous reaction. Further, density functional theory calculations and in situ experiments reveal that the single‐atoms Pt coordination accelerates *H desorption, while the triazine units in COFs benefits charge separation and reduced energy barriers of OER rate‐determining step.

Traditional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) often face significant challenges in contaminant degradation due to strong interference from complex water matrices. In this study, o-semiquinone radicals (o-SQ•-)-driven AOP was established by MnO2-mediated catechol oxidation, achieving selective degradation of aniline contaminants (e.g., sulfamethoxazole (SMX)) in real water matrices. Four MnO2 crystal phases (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-MnO2) were evaluated, and the degradation efficiency of SMX followed the order γ > α > β > δ-MnO2. Both MnO2 surface-bound o-SQ•- and aqueous-phase Mn(II)-o-SQ•- contributed to the SMX degradation. Crystal phases dictated o-SQ•- generation─α-, β-, and γ-MnO2─favored the MnO2 solids surface binding of o-SQ•-, while δ-MnO2 promoted the interaction of o-SQ•- with Mn(II) in the aqueous phase. Higher MnO2 redox potentials and Mn(IV) content correlated with enhanced o-SQ•- generation and faster SMX degradation. Mechanistic studies revealed that o-SQ•- attacks SMX through radical addition, forming low-toxicity products. Given that dihydroxyphenyl is a prevalent component of natural aquatic environments, this work advances the design of selective, eco-friendly AOPs with anti-interference capabilities.

Abstract Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for all life forms, rendering the nitrogen looping one of the most critical biogeochemical processes on Earth. However, global industrial and agricultural activities have severely disrupted natural nitrogen cycling, causing environmental impact and energy consumption through conventional processes such as the Haber–Bosch and Ostwald method. Addressing this imbalance requires innovative technologies that reconcile efficient nitrogen utilization with environmental sustainability. Electrochemical nitrogen transformation, especially the electrochemical oxidation of ammonia under mild conditions, has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the conversion of reactive nitrogen species into energy and valuable products while mitigating environmental impacts. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in ammonia‐centric nitrogen utilization technologies, focusing on their roles as: 1) carbon‐neutral energy vectors (ammonia fuel cells), 2) efficient hydrogen carriers (ammonia cracking), and 3) precursors for high‐value nitrogenous chemicals via controlled oxidation pathways under mild conditions. The full‐chain design framework, namely, from material innovations to practical system integration, is analyzed, while elucidating fundamental reaction mechanisms, performance benchmarks, and scale‐up methodologies. The review aims to provide a foundational reference for developing sustainable electrochemical solutions for establishing a nitrogen‐based and net‐zero energy/resource economics, and in the meantime, addressing the potential nitrogen pollution control and resource recovery.

Developing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for enabling sustainable hydrogen production through water electrolysis. Two-dimensional (2D) boron allotropes, particularly honeycomb borophene (hc-B), have emerged as promising candidates due to their electron-deficient nature and rich active sites. However, this same electron deficiency compromises their structural stability, limiting practical applications. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate a donor–acceptor hc-B/V2CS2 heterostructure, where the V2CS2 substrate plays a dual role in stabilizing hc-B and modulating its catalytic properties. Machine learning-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit water environment confirm the heterostructure's exceptional structural integrity and aqueous tolerance over 50 ps. Remarkably, the hc-B side of the heterostructure exhibits hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy values near the thermoneutral point, outperforming benchmark catalysts such as Pt and the MoS2 S-edge. Electronic structure analyses reveal that the enhanced HER activity arises from substrate-induced modulation of the boron p-band center, which promotes an optimal binding environment for H intermediates through interfacial orbital hybridization and stabilized B–H coordination. Furthermore, reaction pathway analysis incorporating explicit solvation identifies the Volmer–Tafel mechanism as the kinetically preferred route on hc-B/V2CS2. These findings highlight the synergistic role of substrate engineering and interfacial electronic tuning in activating borophene-based HER catalysts, offering new directions for designing high-performance 2D catalytic systems.

Single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts bridge the precision of homogeneous catalysis and the practicality of heterogeneous systems. This Perspective highlights how theory-led approaches, particularly density functional theory and machine learning, enable their rational design. By shifting from combinatorial exploration to targeted prediction, researchers have identified alloy combinations with high activity, selectivity, and stability that would have not been predicted based on conventional catalytic wisdom. The unique geometric and electronic structures of SAAs break scaling relationships and enable bifunctional reactivity. Emerging areas such as dual-atom alloys and plasmon-enhanced and electrochemical catalysis are discussed. As the compositional phase space of bimetallic and trimetallic systems grows exponentially, theoretical guidance is essential to navigate this complexity efficiently. With surface science providing crucial mechanistic insights and AI accelerating screening, we outline a roadmap for predictive catalyst design and advocate for tighter integration between computation and experiment to address pressing challenges in energy and environmental catalysis.

Abstract This study presents the conversion of syngas (synthesis gas, CO + H 2 ) into isobutylene with monoclinic zirconia ( m- ZrO 2 ), mixed monoclinic/tetragonal zirconia ( m / t -ZrO 2 ), tetragonal zirconia ( t- ZrO 2 ) and Ce/La-doped zirconia samples. The physical and chemical properties of the catalyst samples were characterised with nitrogen physisorption, NH 3 and CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Sample material crystal structures were analysed with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis. The pure monoclinic ZrO 2 sample showed the best catalytic performance with 66% CO conversion and 44 mol-% C/hydrocarbons isobutylene selectivity at reaction conditions of 450 °C, 45 bar, GHSV = 2000 h −1 , and CO: H 2 = 1:1. While pure monoclinic ZrO 2 was a highly efficient catalyst for the isosynthesis reaction, pure tetragonal ZrO 2 produced only a minor amount of isobutylene (~ 1 mol-%C/hydrocarbons). Interestingly, Ce/La-doped zirconia had a cubic/tetragonal crystal structure, while showing selectivity and activity comparable to m -ZrO 2 (CO conversion 64% and isobutylene selectivity of 40 mol-% C/hydrocarbons). Although samples with a purely t -ZrO₂ crystal phase significantly reduced the desired isobutylene selectivity, catalysts with relatively high Ce/La loadings (17% and 5% of the total catalyst mass) in the cubic/tetragonal crystal structure achieved high isobutylene activity and selectivity, owing to the dopant-induced high base-to-acid site ratio and enhanced synthesis gas adsorption capacity. According to the results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the poor selectivity of the t- ZrO 2 phase towards isobutylene was due to the promoted intermediate methanation on the coordinatively saturated sites of t- ZrO 2 . Compared to the t -ZrO 2 sample, m -ZrO 2 showed high isobutylene selectivity and activity related to high base to acid site ratio, high synthesis gas adsorption capacity, and kinetically favourable crystal structure to form C 2+ hydrocarbons from C 1 intermediates. These results are important factors in the future work to prepare intrinsically active and isobutylene selective catalysts for the isosynthesis reaction.

Abstract Clinical oncology grapples with persistent challenges, particularly the rapid onset of tumor resistance and the systemic limitations of conventional chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox). Despite its potency, Dox suffers from poor solubility, non‐specific distribution, and severe toxicity, often compromising therapeutic efficacy. Addressing these obstacles, this study explores cobalt‐aluminium layered double hydroxides (Co‐Al LDHs) as smart nanocarriers for targeted melanoma therapy. Capitalizing on their tunable structure, high drug‐loading capacity, and biocompatibility, Co‐Al LDHs facilitate enhanced encapsulation, sustained release, and selective tumor accumulation of Dox. Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses confirm robust molecular interactions between Dox and the LDH matrix, ensuring structural stability and favorable energetics for drug delivery. In vitro assays reveal significant cytotoxicity (≈80%) against melanoma cells and with minimal toxicity (≈8%) to normal muscle cells. Furthermore, in vivo evaluations using luciferase‐tagged B16‐F10 melanoma models demonstrate pronounced tumor inhibition and excellent systemic biocompatibility. Augmented by machine learning‐guided force field modelling, this platform also offers a predictive framework for engineering next‐generation nanotherapeutics. Together, these findings position Co‐Al LDHs as a promising frontier in nanomedicine, merging targeted delivery, controlled release, and computational precision to overcome current therapeutic barriers in melanoma treatment and beyond.

Abstract Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) offer a promising platform for efficient energy conversion and storage at reduced temperatures (<650 °C). However, the commercial viability of PCECs remains hindered by the limited durability and sluggish oxygen electrocatalysis at the air electrode. Herein, a high‐entropy perovskite oxide (HEPO), Pr 0.2 Ba 0.2 Sr 0.2 La 0.2 Nd 0.2 CoO 3‐δ (PBSLNC), in a nanofiber architecture is presented as a bifunctional air electrode material for reversible PCEC operation. The unique A‐site compositional complexity promotes defect tolerance, abundant oxygen vacancies, rapid surface exchange kinetics while maintaining exceptional phase stability in harsh environments. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the entropically modulated Co environment that enhances hydroperoxide adsorption—a key step for oxygen electrocatalysis, thereby facilitating both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. When deployed into a PCEC configuration, the PBSNLC nanofiber electrode achieves a peak power density of 1.4 W cm −2 at 650 °C and electrolysis current density of 3.98 A cm −2 at 650 °C, along with outstanding operational stability during continuous operation for over 1000 h. These findings provide valuable guidance for the strategic design of highly efficient and stable bifunctional air electrodes for PCECs.

Abstract In this work, Pt‐based bimetal catalysts PtM@C 6 N 6 (M = 3d, 4d, 5d) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is systematically investigated by comprehensive consideration of different coordination modes and anchored sites of Pt and M atoms on experimentally synthesized C 6 N 6 substrate, different adsorption configuration of O 2 molecule from both above and below the catalyst surface, different reaction pathway, and structure‐activity relationship via computer‐aided screening and density functional theory (DFT) computations. Comprehensive search and in‐deep analysis reveal that seven representative electrocatalysts (i.e., PtAg@, PtCd@, PtCu@, PtIr@, PtRh@, PtHf@, and PtZr@C 6 N 6 ) demonstrate high ORR catalytic activities under both acidic and basic conditions with favorable overpotentials. Full reaction pathway search demonstrates that the ORR follows a 4‐electron mechanism with the final product H 2 O/OH − . PtCd@, PtCu@, PtIr@, PtRh@, and PtZr@C 6 N 6 exhibit superior activities with low η ORR due to their moderate adsorption strength of *OH, while PtAg@ and PtHf@C 6 N 6 exhibit excellent catalytic performance is attributed to moderate O 2 adsorption Furthermore, a series of descriptors (e.g., ΔG 0 a , ΔG 4 a , ΔG 4 a –d(Pt‐M), and [d(Pt‐O2)×d(M‐O2)]×[d(M‐O2)/d(M‐O1)], etc) are uncovered to unveil the origin of catalyst activity. These findings pave a significant path for the development of efficient ORR catalysts and are expected to stimulate experimental efforts in this direction.

Abstract Industrial water electrolysis faces a triple challenge at high current densities (≥500 mA cm −2 ): reconciling catalytic activity, stability, and severe gas‐liquid transport. While high‐entropy oxides (HEOs) show catalytic promise, conventional methods predominantly focus on elemental regulation and neglect critical morphological optimization, thus failing to unify composition‐architecture‐transport functionality to prevail at industrial conditions. Here, the morphological HEO electrode is introduced, a bioinspired framework integrating multielement mixing, architectural hierarchy, and surface adaptation. High‐throughput optimization identifies a critical nanosecond laser parameter window where rapid quenching traps metastable FeCoNiMoCrO x HEO nanoparticles foliage while Marangoni flows sculpt Ti microcone trunks. This structure exhibits superaerophobic‐superhydrophilic properties and exceptional oxygen evolution performance (η 10 = 188 mV). In an anion‐exchange membrane electrolyzer, the electrode achieves 1 A cm −2 at 1.82 V (surpassing commercial IrO 2 ‐coated Ti mesh), while maintaining stable operation for 600 h at 500 mA cm −2 (degradation rate: 38.33 µV h −1 ). DFT calculations confirm that Mo/Cr electronically modulates the primary OER active Ni sites via the M‐O‐M network, optimizing the d‐band center and favoring the Adsorbate Evolution Mechanism (AEM). This work establishes a paradigm for industrial electrocatalysts by encoding compositional complexity, structural coherence, and interfacial adaptability through morphological design, where multifunctionality emerges from multiscale synergy rather than isolated optimization.

Catalytic oxidation technologies for industrial exhaust emissions (e.g., VOCs, CO, and NOx) have gained significant attention due to the severe environmental and public health impacts. Recent advances highlight cobalt-based oxides as superior catalytic materials owing to excellent physicochemical properties, but the diverse compositions of industrial exhaust gases present significant obstacles in their practical applications. To develop rational design strategies for efficient cobalt-based oxides, exploring the structure–activity relationship (SAR) provides guidance for engineering structural properties to enhance performance. In this context, this review delves into how SAR impacts catalytic performance in exhaust gas purification through geometric structure modulation (size effects, morphology, and surface defect structures) and electronic structure modulation (Co–O bond strengths, d-band centers, coordination environments, and constrained structures). Furthermore, special attention is given to mechanistic studies combining reaction kinetic modeling, in situ spectroscopic characterization, and the effects of water vapor and SO2 on catalytic oxidation processes. We further outline emerging synthetic strategies and ongoing challenges for the design of next-generation cobalt-based catalysts. This review provides guidance and inspiration for the development of high-performance cobalt-based oxides for exhaust gas purification.

The competitiveness of hydrogen as a fuel of the future relies on the development of low-cost, readily available, and efficient catalysts. Transition metal phosphides (TMP), mainly in multimetallic compositions, are recognized as an excellent alternative to platinum-based catalysts in electrolyzers and fuel cells. Herein, for the first time, the connection of the spray drying method as a user-friendly technique for the large-scale production of TMP as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is presented. Three types of catalysts based on MoFeP modified with Co and Ni as third elements were compared by electrochemical methods in an alkaline medium of 1 M KOH. Among the studied materials, the as-prepared MoFeCoP electrocatalysts exhibited the lowest reaction overpotentials (η10) of −285 mV, with Tafel slopes of 83 mV dec–1, low activation energy for the HER and sufficient durability in long-term stability tests. The high value of differential capacitance for both trimetallic materials MoFeNiP and MoFeCoP indicates a large surface area, resulting in excellent features for hydrogen production and application.

Abstract 2D metal heterostructures have shown great promise as highly efficient catalysts. However, how the spatial configuration of distinct components within 2D metal heterostructures affects their electrocatalytic performance still remains unclear. Herein, the controlled construction of Pd‐Pt heterostructures with two distinct spatial configurations are reported, i.e., novel lateral heterostructure and conventional core–shell structure, through different epitaxial growth modes. Specifically, Pd‐Pt mesoporous nanosheets (Pd‐Pt MNSs) with abundant exposed Pd‐Pt planar interfaces are prepared through the in‐plane lateral epitaxial growth of Pt on Pd mesoporous nanosheets (Pd MNSs) by using carbon monoxide (CO) as a capping agent, which can selectively cover the (111) basal plane of Pd MNSs to inhibit the Pt growth on the basal planes, while Pd@Pt core–shell mesoporous nanosheets (Pd@Pt MNSs) are obtained without CO. Impressively, the obtained Pd‐Pt MNSs exhibit excellent catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, outperforming the Pd@Pt MNSs and commercial Pd/C. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the exposed Pd‐Pt planar interface in Pd‐Pt MNSs possesses the preferential adsorption of reaction intermediates, demonstrating a reduced energy barrier in ORR compared to individual Pd and Pt sites. This work highlights the critical role of engineering the spatial configuration in metal heterostructures for efficient electrocatalysis.

Reactive element (RE) additions are widely known to improve the oxidation resistance of structural alloys in high-temperature applications, yet their atomistic role in oxide formation and adhesion remains unclear. Herein, first-principles calculations were employed to reveal the mechanistic influence of selected RE on the surface oxidation of a CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy. REs were found to improve oxygen binding strength, facilitate charge transfer at the metal-oxide interface, reduce activation energy for oxygen diffusion, promote early-stage oxide nucleation, and improve scale adherence. Our findings bridge experimental observations with atomistic theory, offering insight for the design of oxidation-resistant materials capable of withstanding harsh environments.

The reactivity of nanoparticles is governed by their surface composition, which tends to vary significantly under reactive conditions. In this study, the impacts of temperature and the presence of a CO or O2 atmosphere on the structures of Au79, Cu19Au60, Cu39Au40, Cu60Au19, and Cu79 nanoparticles were investigated using a combination of global optimization, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. We find that increasing gold content weakens CO and O adsorption and limits oxygen-induced structural changes, while copper-rich particles undergo pronounced oxidation and reconstruction. Bader charge analysis shows that, in bare nanoalloys, Au withdraws electron density from Cu due to their electronegativity difference. In oxidized Cu–Au nanoalloys, the charge on Cu atoms depends on the number of O neighbors and can reach values typical of Cu2O (0.6 e) and CuO (1.1 e). On average, the Cu atoms exhibit positive effective Bader charges of ∼0.9 e in these nanoalloys. Our results indicate that models of Cu–Au catalysts under oxidizing conditions must incorporate the full ensemble of metallic and oxidized configurations rather than a single most probable structure to predict true catalytic activity.

Abstract Metal‐based site, as an important type of active site, plays the benchmarking role in the redox and charge transfer processes in the heterogeneous catalysis. Modulating the valence state of metal site as a promising and simple strategy theoretically enables control over the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates. However, this strategy is intrinsically limited by the local atomic configuration, often leading to unpredictable catalytic failures. Here, it is reported that the intermediate adsorption strength of platinum active site with different valence states exhibits a linear relationship with the d‐band width of Pt (W d ‐Pt ). Adjusting the nearest‐neighbor coordination environment of Pt sites by changing the transition metals bonded to Pt effectively modulates the W d ‐Pt , which offers a high activity (η 10 = 14 mV) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). W d ‐Pt broadening elevates the Pt─H anti‐bonding states across the Fermi level, strengthening active site‐absorbate interactions and thereby tuning HER catalytic activity. In addition, this d‐band width engineering strategy can be expanded to other catalysts with the metal active site. The present study transcends limitations in valence state modulation and sheds light on deeper understanding of d‐band structure of metal sites and a methodology to boost the activity of metal sites in heterogeneous catalysis.

In this study, 3d transition metal (TM) atom‐decorated MXenes (TM@Mo 3 C 2 where TM = ScZn) are used as potential catalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) using density functional theory‐based screening. The favorable work function, strong N 2 activation, effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) suppression, and high current density collectively establish V@Mo 3 C 2 as a highly promising NRR catalyst, warranting in‐depth exploration. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm the thermal stability of V@Mo 3 C 2 at 300 K. The side‐on N 2 adsorption on V@Mo 3 C 2 favors enzymatic and consecutive reaction pathways. Notably, the reaction free‐energy changes in the consecutive pathway are exothermic, contributing to an exceptionally low potential‐determining step. Furthermore, V@Mo 3 C 2 demonstrates a Faradaic efficiency value of 99.9%. Overall, V@Mo 3 C 2 exhibits remarkable selectivity for the NRR compared to the HER, exhibiting a low current density, which inhibits the HER and high Faradaic efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential of alternate TM‐based MXenes surfaces, such as V@Mo 3 C 2 , for efficient ammonia synthesis.

This work provides a detailed overview of density functional theory (DFT) methods for treating molecular and periodic systems within the TURBOMOLE software package. The implementation employs Gaussian-type orbitals and is based on efficient real-space techniques and density-fitting approaches for Coulomb interactions. Recent developments are reviewed, including the treatment of relativistic effects with effective core potentials, the incorporation of spin–orbit coupling via two-component formalisms, and the extension to real-time time-dependent DFT (RT-TDDFT). Embedding schemes based on frozen-density and projection-based approaches are also discussed, enabling the combination of DFT with high-level correlated wave function methods and many-body perturbation theory for selected subsystems. Representative applications demonstrate the capabilities across bulk materials, surfaces, low-dimensional nanostructures, and adsorption processes. Additionally, a web-based graphical interface has been developed to support input generation, structure manipulation, and output analysis. By consolidating theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and application examples, this work provides a reference for the use of periodic DFT methods in quantum chemical and materials science studies.

We present a comprehensive vibrational analysis of hydrogen boride sheets through first-principles calculations, focusing on a variety of local structural configurations, including surfaces, edges, and bilayer models—some of which contain vacancy and substitutional defects. A database of vibrational modes and simulated infrared spectra was constructed, revealing distinct spectral features that serve as characteristic fingerprints for different bonding environments. By analyzing mode distributions with respect to coordination environments, we identify the distinct contributions of terminal and bridging hydrogen atoms to specific spectral regions. The results show that structural modifications, such as interlayer stacking and edge termination, have a significant influence on vibrational characteristics, particularly in the intermediate and high frequency regions. The vibrational database enables the precise interpretation of infrared spectra and offers a reliable reference for model selection and peak analysis in both experimental and theoretical studies on hydrogen boride sheets and related materials.

Abstract Adsorption energies are key catalytic descriptors that reveal adsorbate-site interactions on heterogeneous catalysts. However, their computation via DFT is time-consuming, limiting high-throughput screening. This work presents a machine learning (ML) methodology based on graph representations of local adsorption sites, using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with per-atom local descriptors derived from accessible physicochemical properties. The approach is evaluated on two bimetallic datasets. The first includes AB-type bimetallic flat surfaces with varying A:B ratios, predicting binding energies for small monodentate adsorbates (C, N, O, S, H) with MSEs of 0.073/0.181 eV (train/test). The second dataset comprises reaction energies of key intermediates for CO2 hydrogenation on Ni-Ga-based surfaces. The GNN model achieves an impressive performance (MSE: 0.001/0.002 (train/test) eV) on complex atomic configurations, even bidentate ones. Beyond predictive performance, clustering analysis provides an explainable framework, showing how structural and electronic descriptors can rationally guide catalyst design and deepen understanding of adsorbate-metal interactions.

The growth mechanism of double- or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs or MWCNTs) via floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) is still an uncharted territory, despite its significance in achieving controlled synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with desired material properties. To address this knowledge gap, we employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations to investigate the stability and growth of DWCNT caps and shorter tubular segments on the surface of icosahedral Fe147 and Fe309 nanoparticles. Both zigzag and armchair CNTs with different diameters were considered as inner and outer tubes in our model systems. The tube growth was found to be mainly dependent on the diameter, while chirality plays a minor role. Furthermore, the results reveal that while the formation and growth of the outer tube are more favorable, its presence promotes the growth of the inner tube. Our findings suggest that the growth of inner and outer tubes in the FCCVD process occurs simultaneously rather than following a layer-by-layer mechanism. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how nanoparticle and tube diameters influence the growth of DWCNTs.

We report a high-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of the thermosalient molecular crystal N'-2-propylidene-4hydroxybenzohydrazide. We find that it features one of the largest negative linear compressibilities recorded, with a coefficient of −39 TPa–1. With increasing pressure, it converts to a positive linear compressibility and at even higher pressures again to a negative linear compressibility. This switchable behavior arises from the pressure-induced straightening of the hydrogen-bonded zigzag chains, which is eventually counteracted by direct bond compression. To capture this mechanism, we trained a machine-learning interatomic potential and performed quasi-harmonic free-energy calculations, thereby obtaining atomistic insight across the whole pressure range. These findings broaden the still-scarce catalog of organic crystals that combine thermosalient activity with experimentally verified, pressure-tunable NLC.

As a promising new energy storage device, low-temperature adaptability and slow reaction kinetics have become a restriction to flexible zinc-air batteries (FZABs) serviced in extreme environments. The research on electrocatalysts rich in oxygen vacancies (OV) to drive low-temperature FZAB performance still faces significant challenges. Developing high-entropy spinel oxides (HESOs) rich in OV is critical to improving the low-temperature FZAB performance. Herein, (FeCrCuNiMn)3O4 is synthesized using a five-metal element via a hydrothermal calcination method and loaded with three-dimensional graphene (3D-G), revealing the key role of OV in synergistically enhancing the performance of FZABs through dual active sites and interfacial charge transfer to drive electrocatalysis. The prepared electrocatalysts exhibit enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity, which drives FZABs at −25 °C, with a peak power density of up to 60.1 mW cm–2, a stable voltage gap of 0.74 V, and remarkable low-temperature cycling stability. This work effectively solves the low-temperature limitations of the FZABs by using a high-entropy strategy to improve the ORR/OER, providing a new approach for advanced green and sustainable energy conversion and storage.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a cornerstone technology for green hydrogen production, yet the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media remains a major bottleneck. Noble metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 are effective but suffer from high cost and scarcity. As a non-precious alternative, spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has attracted attention due to its promising performance results from its mixed-valence structure, tunable electronic properties and catalytic potential. However, its practical application is challenged by poor conductivity, moderate activity and instability under acidic conditions due to proton attack and lattice degradation. This review summarises recent advances in Co3O4-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER. We first introduce three key OER pathways: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and oxide path mechanism (OPM) and their relevance to Co3O4 performance. Then, we introduce the structural and electronic characteristics of Co3O4 that influence its catalytic behaviour. Next, we review a range of engineering strategies, including element doping, heterostructure construction, surface modification and defect engineering, all aimed at enhancing the activity and durability of Co3O4. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and offer perspectives for advancing Co3O4 as a viable acidic OER catalyst.

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a crucial step in the production of hydrogen through the electrolysis of H2O. Platinum-based materials are regarded as the most effective catalysts for HER due to their low overpotential and high stability. However, the scarcity and high cost of platinum limit its application on a large scale. In this study, we employed first-principles methods to investigate the HER performance of a series of single-atom catalysts based on the B28 cluster. This cage-like B28 cluster shows instability for only five out of 40 metal atom candidates, which can be attributed to the presence of hexagonal and octagonal holes that allow for effective anchoring of single atoms. We utilized the integrated crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (ICOHP) as a vital descriptor to assess the strength of the interaction between the metal atoms and the B28 cluster, demonstrating a linear correlation with binding energy. By calculating changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) for hydrogen absorption, we identified four species (Ge@B28, Cu@B28, Ni@B28, and Pt@B28) that exhibit superior HER catalytic activity with |ΔGH*| around 0.2 eV. Moreover, our results indicate that these four species are more likely to produce H2 through the Tafel reaction. This study provides evidence that boron clusters have the potential to serve as single-atom supports and as catalysts for HER. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for the experimental design of novel nanocatalysts.
