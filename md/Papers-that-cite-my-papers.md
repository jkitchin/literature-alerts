Since their introduction in 2004, high entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical and functional properties. Advances in our understanding of atomic-scale ordering and phase formation in HEAs have facilitated the development of fabrication techniques for synthesizing nanostructured HEAs. These materials hold immense potential for applications in various fields including automobile industries, aerospace engineering, microelectronics, and clean energy, where they serve as either structural or functional materials. In this comprehensive Review, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanical and functional properties of nanostructured HEAs, with a particular emphasis on the roles of different nanostructures in modulating these properties. To begin, we explore the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the formation and stability of nanostructures in HEAs. Subsequently, we delve into an examination of the mechanical and electrocatalytic properties exhibited by bulk or three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured HEAs, as well as nanosized HEAs in the form of zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, or two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets. Finally, we present an outlook on the current research landscape, highlighting the challenges and opportunities associated with nanostructure design and the understanding of structure-property relationships in nanostructured HEAs.

Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation offers an efficient, environmentally friendly, and energy-saving approach for ammonia synthesis. In this study, semiconductor materials, particularly graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) combined with single metal atoms, were theoretically investigated to identify promising candidates as nitrogen fixation photocatalysts. Initially, six different single 3d transition-metal atoms, i.e., V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, were loaded onto g-C3N4, and the optimal single-atom catalyst, Fe@g-C3N4, was selected through reaction energy calculations. This catalyst demonstrated excellent performance in terms of the electronic structure and light absorption properties. Furthermore, machine learning methods were applied to a limited sample set to predict a catalyst with a superior performance beyond the computational samples. Utilizing a backward elimination method and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) training, the key descriptors correlated with the target properties of the catalysts were identified. The SISSO descriptors, consisting of structural and electronic characteristic parameters, are interpretable and provide meaningful insights. Importantly, a catalyst, Ru@g-C3N4, with outstanding performance was predicted and verified by density functional theory calculations. This catalyst design strategy demonstrates promising results with limited computational data, highlighting the potential of combining theoretical simulations with machine learning methods for catalyst design.

This review discusses the recent developments of single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts toward CO2, CO, N2, and NO3– hydrogenation reactions in the electrocatalysis context, a natural expansion from the thermal catalysis origin where the concept of SAA was born and validated. Electrocatalytic hydrogenations of CO2, CO, NO3–, and N2 into value-added chemicals offer an attractive general route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions using renewable energy without H2 feed stream. These reactions typically involve multiple electron-transfer-coupled elementary reaction steps that are of broad relevance to many electrocatalytic applications, making them well-positioned for translational fundamental studies relevant to other emerging electrochemical reactions. While there has been exciting progress in SAA research for various thermal catalytic reactions in the last decade, the design, application, and characterization of SAA catalysts in electrocatalysis remain nascent with intriguing uncertainties and ample opportunities. We highlight the recent research findings in this growing area, where the SAAs, owing to their unique doped metal properties and atomically precise bimetallic synergies, promote selective reaction pathways by tuning binding energies and distributions of adsorbates/intermediates. We also provide our perspective on this growing research area's potential challenges and opportunities.

As one of the potential catalysts, disordered solid solution alloys can offer a wealth of catalytic sites. However, accurately evaluating their activity localization structure and overall activity from each individual site remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an approach based on density functional theory and machine learning was used to obtain a large number of sites of the Pt-Ru alloy as the model multisite catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Subsequently, a series of statistical approaches were employed to unveil the relationship between the geometric structure and overall activity.

The Ir-based electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have demonstrated remarkable durability. Enhancing the Ir-based electrocatalytic activity still remains crucial owing to the scarcity of iridium. Here, a high-temperature sintering technique is employed to fabricate a boron (B)-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 coating with an almost perfect rutile-type crystal structure on a corrosion-resistant titanium substrate, ensuring exceptional stability for the acidic OER. The B-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode fabricated in a mixed solution of 0.6 M H3BO3, exhibits an overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a lower Tafel slope of 34.2 mV dec−1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is far lower than the 272 mV overpotential and the 45.3 mV dec−1 of the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrode. The electrode possesses a minimal potential increase even after undergoing continuous OER for 400 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The incorporation of B species into IrO2-Ta2O5 effectively fine-tunes the electronic structure of Ir active sites, leading to a substantial enhancement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. This study provides promising prospects for reducing the energy consumption of noble IrO2-based electrocatalysts in the practical application of electrochemical industry for the acidic OER.

n-Butane dehydrogenation to butene and butadiene has recently gained increasing attention owing to the exploitation and development of shale gas as well as the rapid growth in the demand for synthetic rubber worldwide. In this work, the full n-butane dehydrogenation reaction network involving 568 elementary steps on Pt is established by using a chemical informatics approach to loop over all of the atoms and chemical bonds in n-butane. By combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Morgan molecular fingerprint method, and machine learning techniques, we have identified 208 elementary steps that contribute to the kinetically important reaction network, which presents some general guidelines for the formulation of mechanisms of great complexity. A detailed microkinetic analysis that ensures thermodynamic consistency is then performed, without and with the presence of H2 cofeeding, to assess the n-butane catalytic activity and butene selectivity. It turns out that in the absence of H2, the high coverages of the coke precursors give rise to a low catalytic activity due to the occupancy of a large number of active sites. The turnover frequencies for n-butane consumption and butene production rise rapidly as the H2/n-C4H10 ratio goes up from 0 to 1.33. Meanwhile, the selectivity toward 1-butene increases as well, whereas the selectivities toward 2-butene and 1,3-butadiene are not sensitive to the H2 partial pressure. The flux analysis reveals that the dominant reaction pathways for 1-butene and 2-butene follow the reverse Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism, and the byproducts are formed primarily by the C–C bond cleavage in CH3CCHC*. The C–H bond activation in n-butane is identified by the sensitivity analysis as the rate-limiting step for the overall reaction while the selectivities toward butenes are found to be controlled dominantly by the ease with which n-butane can be activated and how readily butenes can be deeply dehydrogenated.

In the application of renewable energy, the oxidation–reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two crucial reactions. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on metal-doped graphene have been widely employed due to their high activity and high atom utilization efficiency. However, the catalytic activity is significantly influenced by different metals and local coordination, making it challenging to efficiently screen through either experimental or density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To address this issue, this study employed a combination of DFT calculations and machine learning (DFT-ML) to investigate rare earth-modified carbon-based (RENxC6–x) electrocatalysts. Based on computational data from 75 catalysts, we trained two ML models to capture the underlying patterns of physical properties and overpotential. Subsequently, the candidate catalysts were screened, leading to the discovery of four ORR catalysts, nine OER catalysts, and five bifunctional electrocatalysts, all of which were thoroughly validated for their stability. Lastly, by integrating the ML models with the SHAP analysis framework, we revealed the influence of atomic radius, Pauling electronegativity, and other features on the catalytic activity. Additionally, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of potential catalysts through DFT calculations. The revolutionary DFT-ML approach provides a crucial driving force for the design and synthesis of potential catalysts in subsequent studies.

Abstract The versatile Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relation stipulates the kinetics of a reaction in terms of thermodynamics. Herein, we establish the BEP relation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from fundamental electrochemical principles leveraging the Butler-Volmer relation for a one-step, one-electron process and the transition state theory. Based on first-principles investigations of HER mechanisms on fourteen metal electrodes, we firmly justify the BEP relation solely using an easy-to compute hydrogen adsorption free energy and universal electrochemical constants.

Understanding the nonequilibrium transformation of nanocatalysts under reaction conditions is important because metastable atomic structures may be created during the process, which offers unique activities in reactions. Although reshaping of metal nanoparticles (NPs) under reaction conditions has been widely recognized, the dynamic reshaping process has been less studied at the atomic scale. Here, we develop an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo model to simulate the complete reshaping process of Pt nanoparticles in a CO environment and reveal the in situ formation of atomic clusters on the NP surface, a new type of active site beyond conventional understanding, boosting the reactivities in the CO oxidation reaction. Interestingly, highly active peninsula and inactive island clusters both form on the (111) facets and interchange in varying states of dynamic equilibrium, which influences the catalytic activities significantly. This study provides new fundamental knowledge of nanocatalysis and new guidance for the rational design of nanocatalysts.

## Physical Prior Mean Function-Driven Gaussian Processes Search for Minimum-Energy Reaction Paths with a Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Band: A General Method for Gas-Phase, Interfacial, and Bulk-Phase Reactions

The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method serves as an indispensable tool for computational chemists, offering insight into minimum-energy reaction paths (MEPs) by delineating both transition states (TSs) and intermediate nonstationary structures along reaction coordinates. However, executing CI-NEB calculations for reactions with extensive reaction coordinate spans necessitates a large number of images to ensure a reliable convergence of the MEPs and TS structures, presenting a computationally demanding optimization challenge, even with mildly costly electronic-structure methods. In this study, we advocate for the utilization of physically inspired prior mean function-based Gaussian processes (GPs) to expedite MEP exploration and TS optimization via the CI-NEB method. By incorporating reliable prior physical approximations into potential energy surface (PES) modeling, we demonstrate enhanced efficiency in multidimensional CI-NEB optimization with surrogate-based optimizers. Our physically informed GP approach not only outperforms traditional nonsurrogate-based optimizers in optimization efficiency but also on-the-fly learns the reaction path valley during optimization, culminating in significant advancements. The surrogate PES derived from our optimization exhibits high accuracy compared to true PES references, aligning with our emphasis on leveraging reliable physical priors for robust and efficient posterior mean learning in GPs. Through a systematic benchmark study encompassing various reaction pathways, including gas-phase, bulk-phase, and interfacial/surface reactions, our physical GPs consistently demonstrate superior efficiency and reliability. For instance, they outperform the popular fast inertial relaxation engine optimizer by approximately a factor of 10, showcasing their versatility and efficacy in exploring reaction mechanisms and surface reaction PESs.

It has been reported that it was selective to produce ammonia on metallic cobalt in the electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (eNORR), where hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cobalt outperforms face-centered cubic (fcc) cobalt. However, hydroxylamine is more selectively produced on a cobalt single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC). Herein, we uncover the structural sensitivity over hcp-Co, fcc-Co, and Co-SAC in eNORR by employing a recently developed constant potential simulation method and microkinetic modeling. It was found that the superior activity for ammonia production on hcp-Co can be attributed to its facile electron and proton transfer and a stronger lateral suppression effect from NO* over fcc-Co. The exceptional hydroxylamine selectivity on Co-SAC is due to the modified electronic structure, namely, a positively charged active center. It was found that it is more favorable to produce NOH* over hcp-Co and fcc-Co, while HNO* is more preferable on Co-SAC, which are firmly correlated with the vertical and strong NO adsorption on the former and the moderate adsorption on the latter. In other words, a key factor for selectivity control is the first step of NO* protonation. Therefore, the local structure and electronic structure of the catalysts can be critical in regulating the activity and selectivity in eNORR.

The attainment of carbon neutrality has become a global consensus as a result of the increasing environmental problems caused by the consumption of fossil fuels. To achieve this objective, there has been widespread attention towards the electrocatalytic reduction reaction of carbon dioxide driven by renewable energy sources due to its mild reaction conditions. In recent years, generating high value-added multicarbon products has been the focus of considerable research efforts. However, the process of generating these products has been restricted by the complexity of the reaction path, the limitations of the scaling relationship, and the poor adaptability to the reaction environment, thereby impeding previous studies from achieving efficient conversion at high current densities. As a result, a more suitable catalyst design strategy is required to obtain high value-added products. This study proposes that the design approach of tandem catalysis will be effective in generating multicarbon products by exploring the mechanism of C–C bond coupling and the configuration of the reaction environment. This research summaries the mechanism and design requirements of tandem catalysis scaled by different intermediates transport distances and review strategies of tandem catalyst configurations, such as nanostructures, phase-mixed, phase-separated, and application of special supports, in facilitating the generation of multicarbon products. The study provides suggestions for the design of CO2 electrocatalytic tandem catalysts and conclude with a discussion of possible future directions.

Numerous electrochemistry reactions require the precise calculation of the ion solvation energy. Despite the significant progress in the first-principles calculations for crystals and defect formation energies for solids, the liquid system free energy calculations still face many challenges. Ion solvation free energies can be calculated via different semiempirical ways, e.g., using implicit solvent models or cluster of explicit molecule models; however, systematically improving these models is difficult due to their lack of a solid theoretical base. A theoretically sound approach for calculating the free energy is to use thermodynamic integration. Nevertheless, owing to the difficulties of self-consistent convergence in first-principles calculations for unphysical atomic configurations, the computational alchemy approach has not been widely used for first-principles calculations. This study proposes a general approach to use first-principles computational alchemy for calculating the ion solvation energy. This approach is also applicable for other small molecules. The calculated ion solvation free energies for Li+, Na+, K+, Be2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ are close to the experimental results, and the standard deviation due to molecular dynamics fluctuations is within 0.06 eV.

The reaction rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important factor restricting its application. In this work, we have systematic explorated of N, O coordination number on the catalytic performance for ORR and OER. Firstly, a variety of stability analysis methods show that most of the catalysts have excellent stability. Secondly, a series of excellent bifunctional catalysts are screened by volcanic maps, ORR overpotential (ηORR), OER overpotential (ηOER), and bifunctional index (BI), such as, RhN3O1-1 (ηORR = 0.28 V, ηOER = 0.34 V, BI = 0.62 V) and CoN3O1-1 (ηORR = 0.33 V, ηOER = 0.37 V, BI = 0.70 V). In particular, RhN3O1-1 has the smallest BI value, indicating that it has the best bifunctional catalytic activity. This study offers insights into how the coordination environment affects the activity of OER/ORR.

Electrochemical water decomposition is a promising alternative to hydrogen production (HER), but it is significantly limited by the scarcity of precious metals. Here, we propose a highly efficient yet low-cost phosphorus-modified nickel/tungsten nitride (P-Ni/WN) electrocatalyst, which exhibits excellent HER performance with a low overpotential (45 mV at 10 mA cm–2) and a high exchange current density (2.02 mA cm–2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments reveal that the introduction of P and Ni attracts electrons from W species, making WN more conducive to the HER reaction. Moreover, the P doping contributes to the dispersion of Ni nanoparticles on the WN support, thereby enhancing the HER performance of the P-Ni/WN catalyst. This work provides a facile approach to improve the electrocatalytic activity of nickel-based catalysts in the context of the HER.

Many highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) demonstrate strong pH-dependent catalytic activities. However, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is still a subject of debate. In this study, delithiated Li0.5CoO2 is utilized as a model catalyst due to its tunable chemical states and layered structure that can facilitate reversible intercalation and deintercalation of cations. By increasing the pH to 14 using a 1.0 M CsOH solution, rapid intercalation of Cs+ cations and water molecules induce notable lattice expansion up to 9.9 Å, resulting in an order of magnitude higher OER intrinsic activity comparing to that in 0.1 M CsOH. It is hypothesized that lattice water in layered structure facilitates the dynamic intercalation and deintercalation of Cs+ cations, promoting the so-called "electrochemical-chemical" reaction mechanism. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate nature of surface dynamics and the redox chemistry on the catalyst/electrolyte interface during the OER.

In a unified regenerative fuel cell (URFC) or reversible fuel cell, the oxygen bifunctional catalyst must switch reversibly between the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), fuel cell mode, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), electrolyzer mode. However, it is often unclear what effect alternating between ORR and OER has on the electrochemical behavior and physiochemical properties of the catalyst. Herein, operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is utilized to monitor the continuous and dynamic evolution of the Co, Mn, and Fe oxidation states of perovskite catalysts Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3‐δ (BSCF) and La 0.4 Sr 0.6 MnO 3‐δ (LSM), while the potential is oscillated between reducing and oxidizing potentials with cyclic voltammetry. The results reveal the importance of investigating bifunctional catalysts by alternating between fuel cell and electrolyzer operation and highlight the limitations and challenges of bifunctional catalysts. It is shown that the requirements for ORR and OER performance are divergent and that the oxidative potentials of OER are detrimental to ORR activity. These findings are used to give guidelines for future bifunctional catalyst design. Additionally, it is demonstrated how sunlight can be used to reactivate the ORR activity of LSM after rigorous cycling.

Completely achieving spontaneous water splitting without sacrificing co-catalysts poses a significant challenge, as factors such as electrical, optical, and catalytic activity can limit the conversion efficiency of solar energy to hydrogen. Herein, we propose a type-II van der Waals heterostructure composed of vertically stacked AlO and WSi2N4, and systematically investigate its mechanism and potential for catalyzing water splitting. Photon-induced photocatalytic water splitting takes advantage of the staggered energy bands of the heterojunction, effectively promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers and thus enhancing catalytic efficiency. In neutral water environment, the band edge position of AlO/WSi2N4 aligns with the redox potential required for water decomposition. Thermodynamic analysis of the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions indicates that the external potential provided by photogenerated carriers is expected to trigger spontaneous water decomposition. Moreover, with its high electron mobility (4800.62 cm2/Vs) and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of up to 19.98 %, the AlO/WSi2N4 heterojunction demonstrates substantial potential as a photoelectric catalyst. This research introduces a promising avenue for efficient photocatalytic production of clean energy.

Transition metal (TM) doping exhibits great potential in designing high-performance two-dimensional (2D) NiSe2-based catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). 22 TM atom-doped 2D-NiSe2 catalysts are screened, and the effects of TM doping on the thermal stability and HER catalytic activity are investigated by first-principles calculations. Among them, Cu doped 2D-NiSe2 might exhibit remarkable HER properties with the water dissociation energy of 1.03 eV and H adsorption Gibbs free energy of −0.05 eV. Furthermore, we elucidate the reasons behind the different HER activities. These findings suggest new possibilities for the application of Cu doped 2D-NiSe2 for alkaline HER, offering new perspectives for future research.

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for producing hydrogen gas via electrochemical water splitting. Among diverse strategies to activate the HER, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are efficient alternatives to conventional platinum catalysts, focusing on titanium carbide (TiC) as a support material with good redox and electronic stability. Using this, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of various SAC candidates, screening their thermodynamic stabilities and HER activities. These calculations revealed four possible transition metal (TM) (Pt, Pd, Au, and Ag)-embedded TiC candidates (TM@TiC) that are thermodynamically stable and further suggested that they exhibit an intriguing H*-passivated surface state, significantly improving HER activities. Notably, the Pt@TiC demonstrates superior activity, promoting H2 gas generation due to its unique H*-passivated surface, which enables a sustainable HER. Therefore, this work introduces a new SAC paradigm centered around the H*-passivated surface, expanding the conventional focus on a single TM site.

The co-catalysis between single atom catalyst (SAC) and its support has recently emerged as a promising strategy to synergistically boost the catalytic activity of some complex electrochemical reactions, encompassing multiple intermediates and pathways. Herein, we utilized defective BC3 monolayer-supported SACs as a prototype to investigate the cooperative effects of SACs and their support on the catalytic performance of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for ammonia (NH3) production. The results showed that these SACs can be firmly stabilized on these defective BC3 supports with high stability against aggregation. Furthermore, co-activation of the inert N2 reactant was observed in certain embedded SACs and their neighboring B atoms on the certain BC3 sheets due to the noticeable charge transfer and significant N–N bond elongation. Our high-throughput screening revealed that the Mo/DVCC and W/DVCC exhibit superior NRR catalytic performance, characterized by a low limiting potential of −0.33 and −0.43V, respectively, which can be further increased under acid conditions based on the constant potential method. Moreover, varying NRR catalytic activities can be attributed to the differences in the valence state of active sites. Remarkably, further microkinetic modeling analysis displayed that the turnover frequency of N2–to–NH3 conversion on Mo/DVCC is as large as 1.20 × 10−3 s−1 site−1 at 700 K and 100 bar, thus guaranteeing its ultra-fast reaction rate. Our results not only suggest promising advanced electrocatalysts for NRR, but also offered an effective avenue to regulate the electrocatalytic performance via the co-catalytic metal–support interactions.

Understanding structure–property relationships in atomically precise metal nanoclusters is vital in finding selective and tunable catalysts. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was used to benchmark seven exchange correlation functionals at different basis sets for 17 atomically precise nanoclusters against experimentally determined geometries, band gaps, and optical gaps. The set contains both monometallic and bimetallic clusters that possess at least two types of 3d transition metals (specifically, Cu, Ni, Fe, or Co). The benchmark highlights that PBE0 is a good functional to use regardless of the basis set, and Minnesota functionals do well with respect to specific metals. Further, while long-range corrected functionals overestimate band and optical gaps, they model absorption features better than the other considered functionals. The study additionally looks at the photoinduced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the CO2 reduction mechanism on nanoclusters reported from the literature.

One promising technology for carbon capture is mixed-matrix membrane (MMM) technology. MMMs are composite materials that combine a polymer matrix with inorganic fillers or nanoparticles to enhance the separation performance of the membrane. These membranes offer several advantages, including high selectivity, tunable permeability, and resistance to harsh operating conditions. The incorporation of inorganic fillers or nanoparticles into the polymer matrix improves the separation properties of the membrane by creating a tortuous path for gas molecules, increasing the surface area, and enhancing the interaction between the membrane and the gas molecules. This results in improved carbon dioxide capture efficiency and selectivity. MMM technology offers potential advantages over other carbon capture technologies. It has the potential for lower energy consumption compared to solvent-based absorption processes and can be easily integrated into existing gas separation systems. MMMs also have the advantage of being scalable and cost-effective, making them suitable for large-scale industrial applications. This chapter will delve deeper into the principles of carbon capture technologies, mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs), the materials used in MMMs, the strategies for improving MMMs, and the challenges associated with them.

Abstract Solid‐state dewetting is the heat‐induced agglomeration of thin metal films into defined nanoparticles (NPs). Dewetted Pt nanoparticles are investigated on F‐doped SnO 2 (FTO) substrates as model binder‐free electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Dewetting of Pt films into particles exposes the FTO substrate and the metal/support (Pt‐FTO) contact line. Despite the decrease in Pt electrochemical surface area (ECSA) upon dewetting, dewetted NPs show a >3‐fold increase in ECSA‐normalized HER activity compared to as‐deposited nanocrystalline Pt films. Electrodes designed with dewetted Pt NPs of different sizes show that the HER activity does not only correlate with the ECSA but also increases with increasing the Pt‐FTO contact line length. The smaller the NPs, the larger the Pt‐FTO contact line, and the higher the activity. This effect is ascribed to electronic metal‐support interaction (EMSI), due to electron transfer from FTO to Pt. It is proposed that EMSI effects alter the electronic structure of Pt sites near the Pt‐FTO contact line, facilitating the H 2 evolution kinetics. When NPs are a few nm‐sized, a large mass fraction of Pt is affected by EMSI, resulting in a further increase of HER activity compared to NPs ≥10 nm despite the lower ECSA.

Abstract Lithium-rich oxide cathodes lose energy density during cycling due to atomic disordering and nanoscale structural rearrangements, which are both challenging to characterize. Here we resolve the kinetics and thermodynamics of these processes in an exemplar layered Li-rich (Li 1.2– x Mn 0.8 O 2 ) cathode using a combined approach of ab initio molecular dynamics and cluster expansion-based Monte Carlo simulations. We identify a kinetically accessible and thermodynamically favourable mechanism to form O 2 molecules in the bulk, involving Mn migration and driven by interlayer oxygen dimerization. At the top of charge, the bulk structure locally phase segregates into MnO 2 -rich regions and Mn-deficient nanovoids, which contain O 2 molecules as a nanoconfined fluid. These nanovoids are connected in a percolating network, potentially allowing long-range oxygen transport and linking bulk O 2 formation to surface O 2 loss. These insights highlight the importance of developing strategies to kinetically stabilize the bulk structure of Li-rich O-redox cathodes to maintain their high energy densities.
