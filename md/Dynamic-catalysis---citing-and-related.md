Periodic responses to nonperiodic energy inputs, such as oscillations, are hallmarks of living systems. Nanoparticle-based systems have largely remained unexplored in the generation of oscillatory features. Here, we demonstrate a nanosystem featuring hierarchical response to light, where thermoplasmonic effects and reversible DNA-hybridization generate thermal convective forces and ultimately, oscillatory hydrodynamic flows. The slow aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) serves as a positive feedback, while fast photothermal disassembly acts as negative feedback. These asymmetric feedback loops, combined with thermal hysteresis for time-delay, are essential ingredients for orchestrating an oscillating response.
