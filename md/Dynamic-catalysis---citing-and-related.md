Increased attention has been directed toward generating nonequilibrium hot carriers resulting from the decay of collective electronic oscillations on metal known as surface plasmons. Despite numerous experimental endeavors, demonstrating hot carrier-mediated photocatalysis without a heating contribution has proven challenging, particularly for single electron transfer reactions where the thermal contribution is generally detrimental. An innovative engineering solution is proposed to enable single electron transfer reactions with plasmonics. It consists of a photoelectrode designed as an energy filter and photocatalysis performed with light function modulation instead of continuously. The photoelectrode, consisting of FTO/TiO
