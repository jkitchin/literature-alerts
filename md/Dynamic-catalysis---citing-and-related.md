Abstract Constructing dual catalytic sites with charge density differences is an efficient way to promote urea electrosynthesis from parallel and CO 2 reduction yet still challenging in static system. Herein, a dynamic system is constructed by precisely controlling the asymmetric charge density distribution in an Au‐doped coplanar Cu 7 clusters‐based 3D framework catalyst (Au@cpCu 7 CF). In Au@cpCu 7 CF, the redistributed charge between Au and Cu atoms changed periodically with the application of pulse potentials switching between −0.2 and −0.6 V and greatly facilitated the electrosynthesis of urea. Compared with the static condition of pristine cpCu 7 CF (FE urea = 5.10%), the FE urea of Au@cpCu 7 CF under pulsed potentials is up to 55.53%. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high potential of −0.6 V improved the adsorption of * HNO 2 and * NH 2 on Au atoms and inhibited the reaction pathways of by‐products. While at the low potential of −0.2 V, the charge distribution between Au and Cu atomic sites facilitated the thermodynamic C–N coupling step. This work demonstrated the important role of asymmetric charge distribution under dynamic regulation for urea electrosynthesis, providing a new inspiration for precise control of electrocatalysis.
