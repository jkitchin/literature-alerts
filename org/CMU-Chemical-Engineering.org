An experimental and theoretical study of module collar design is presented here. Hollow fiber membranes are prepared by dip coating a poly(vinylidene) (PVDF) support with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gutter layer and a Pebax 2533 selective layer. Fiber bundles with a well-defined fiber packing are prepared using a 3D printed module. A parallel fiber bundle consisting of 4-9 uniformly spaced fibers is created with printed tabs that align the fibers and create a tubesheet. The tabs are sealed within a printed case that possesses a series of external ports for gas introduction and removal. Uniquely, both port location and the use of a collar to assist fluid distribution in the shell can be varied for the same fiber bundle. Experimental measurements are compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The experimental module design allows high-fidelity representation of the fiber bundle and module case in the simulations. Comparisons between experiment and simulation are in good agreement over a broad range of experimental conditions. The detrimental effect of having ports located too close, leading to stagnation regions, is captured as well as the beneficial effects of using a collar for shell-side fluid distribution around the fiber bundle. Such results help validate the use of CFD to develop high-performance module designs.

Optimal management and desalination of produced water is a major challenge for U.S. oil and gas development. Integrating rigorous desalination models into multi-period produced water network optimization problems presents several hurdles, which need to be tackled using advanced optimization strategies. In this work, a novel multi-period produced water network formulation with separate solid and liquid flows is introduced to avoid singularities at zero flows. Rigorous steady state desalination models based on mechanical vapor recompression are embedded at the desalination sites in the network model. An integrated optimization formulation is developed to co-optimize the design of desalination units along with the operation of the network. Furthermore, a more robust approach based on the trust region filter method is developed to efficiently integrate complex desalination models into the multi-period planning problem. Both optimization approaches are demonstrated on a produced water network from the PARETO library (Drouven et al., 2022) using thermal desalination units. Our results show that while the TRF and integrated approaches have comparable solve times, the TRF approach has better performance reliability in terms of solver convergence. Furthermore, the optimal solution obtained by embedding rigorous models into the network is significantly different than when desalination costs are approximated using simple cost models, which motivates further research in this field.

Non-equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self-organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil-in-water droplet mixtures with predator-prey interactions can result in a variety of self-organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self-organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.

This presentation will report the rational design and fabrication of NETL's highly permeable non-aging thin film composite (TFC) membranes for CO2 capture from various industrial point sources. This talk will also cover the design, computational fluid dynamic simulation, 3D printing, and permeation testing of plate-and-frame membrane modules for an upcoming field demonstration at U. S. Steel's Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, PA. The field test will demonstrate membrane-based CO2 capture from a blast furnace for decarbonization of steel manufacturing for the first time in the U.S. A mobile gas permeation test unit is currently under design and construction for the field test, which is scheduled to take place in 2025.

Dynamic catalysis is a novel and promising approach that aims to improve the catalyst performance by modulating the binding energies of adsorbates to favor different reaction steps periodically. In this work, we investigate a unimolecular dynamic catalytic system, with a focus on methods for simulating the transient behavior and identifying the optimal wave parameters for the modulations. Employing the modeling language Pyomo and the solver IPOPT, we formulate a Boundary Value Problem with limit cycle conditions to obtain results with orders-of-magnitude improvements in computational efficiency when compared to forward integration methods. Leveraging this flexible approach, mathematical optimization was applied to the parameters of piecewise and continuous forcing functions to identify the maximum time-averaged turnover frequency (avTOF). We relate the results to the Extended Sabatier Volcano graphical representation, which provides insight into the behavior and optimal parameters of the target systems. Our results further support the notion that periodic shifts in rate-controlling elementary steps lead to a rate of reaction enhancement beyond the Sabatier limit.

As the consumption of electronics increases worldwide, significant strain is posed on both the availability of mineral resources and the accumulation of waste due to their disposal. Recovering valuable minerals from e-waste can potentially alleviate both. This paper discusses the systematic design of processes for the recycling of waste printed circuit boards (WPCB). After reviewing the relevant processing steps, the generation of processing superstructures is explained. Next, a formulation of the optimization problem is presented to identify the best processing pathway, and the use of process simulators to specify optimization-relevant parameters. These ideas are described in detail via a WPCB to metals case study.
