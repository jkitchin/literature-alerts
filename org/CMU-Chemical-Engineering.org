Over the last two decades, the utility of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has expanded from catalysis and gas storage to biomedical applications such as drug delivery. At first, MOF-based delivery platforms focused on delivering small molecules, with current work focusing on nucleic acids, such as DNA, short guide RNA (sgRNA), and short interfering RNA (siRNA). No studies to this date have specifically shown the encapsulation and delivery of mRNA with MOFs, possibly due to the fragile nature of messenger RNA (mRNA). This study explores and identifies suitable synthetic conditions for encapsulating and delivering mRNA with zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8). Initial ZIF-8 encapsulation attempts, although capable of mRNA loading, could not retain mRNA longer than 1 hour in biological media. To address this issue, we added polyethyleneimine (PEI) to the matrix, enabling the retention of mRNA with 4 hours of stability. Polyethyleneimine incorporation resolves the leakage of mRNA from ZIF-8, enabling delivery and resultant protein expression in multiple cell lines comparable to commercial lipid transfection reagents. Furthermore, we report the first application exploring thermally stable mRNA storage with ZIF-8 with successful protein expression achieved after 3 months of room temperature storage. Together, this work expands the catalog of therapeutics MOFs can deliver.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to game-playing and surpassed the best human-level performance in many domains, yet there are few use-cases in industrial or commercial settings. We introduce OR-Gym, an open-source library for developing reinforcement learning algorithms to address operations research problems. In this paper, we apply reinforcement learning to the knapsack, multi-dimensional bin packing, multi-echelon supply chain, and multi-period asset allocation model problems, as well as benchmark the RL solutions against MILP and heuristic models. These problems are used in logistics, finance, engineering, and are common in many business operation settings. We develop environments based on prototypical models in the literature and implement various optimization and heuristic models in order to benchmark the RL results. By re-framing a series of classic optimization problems as RL tasks, we seek to provide a new tool for the operations research community, while also opening those in the RL community to many of the problems and challenges in the OR field.
