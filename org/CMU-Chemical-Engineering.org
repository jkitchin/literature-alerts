The screening and discovery of magnetic materials are hindered by the computational cost of first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations required to find the ground state magnetic ordering. Although universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), also known as atomistic foundation models, offer high-fidelity models of many atomistic systems with significant speedup, they currently lack the inputs required for predicting magnetic ordering. In this work, we present a data-efficient, spin-informed graph neural network framework that incorporates spin degrees of freedom as inputs and preserves physical symmetries, extending the functionality of uMLIPs to simulate magnetic orderings. This framework speeds up DFT calculations through better initial guesses for magnetic moments, determines the ground-state ordering of bulk materials and even generalizes to magnetic ordering in surfaces. Furthermore, we implement a closed-loop anomaly detection approach that effectively addresses the classic "chicken-and-egg" problem of creating a high-quality dataset while developing a uMLIP, unearthing anomalies in large benchmark datasets and boosting model accuracy.
