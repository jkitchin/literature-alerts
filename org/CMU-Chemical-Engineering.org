The squirmer is a popular model to analyse the fluid mechanics of a self-propelled object, such as a micro-organism. We demonstrate that some fore–aft symmetric squirmers can spontaneously self-propel above a critical Reynolds number. Specifically, we numerically study the effects of inertia on spherical squirmers characterised by an axially and fore–aft symmetric ‘quadrupolar’ distribution of surface-slip velocity; under creeping-flow conditions, such squirmers generate a pure stresslet flow, the stresslet sign classifying the squirmer as either a ‘pusher’ or ‘puller’. Assuming axial symmetry, and over the examined range of the Reynolds number $Re$ (defined based upon the magnitude of the quadrupolar squirming), we find that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the puller case above $Re \approx 14.3$ , with steady swimming emerging from that threshold consistently with a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation and with the swimming speed growing monotonically with $Re$ .
