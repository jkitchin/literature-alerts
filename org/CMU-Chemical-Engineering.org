Abstract Fog holes were reported over cities of the Indo‐Gangetic plains of India, which were attributed to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The present study reports the observational evidence of fog holes over rural area using satellite and ground observations. Delayed onset and early dissipation of fog is observed over the holes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that aerosol‐radiation interaction (ARI) leads to fog holes over both urban and rural regions. The anthropogenic aerosols and associated ARI dominate the UHI effect over the urban fog holes, while the aerosol absorption due to ARI mainly controls the rural fog holes. Turning off aerosol absorption causes ∼ 2 hours delay in the fog dissipation over urban area, whereas it yields persistent fog over rural area under saturated environment. An enhancement of soluble Aitken black carbon over the fog holes indicates the importance of aging process during fog dissipation.
