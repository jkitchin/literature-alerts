Activating the C–H bond in methane represents a cornerstone challenge in catalytic research. While several supported metal oxide nanoclusters (MeO-NCs) have shown promise for this reaction, their optimal composition remains underexplored primarily due to the large number of possible compositions and their amorphous nature. This study addresses these challenges using computational approaches. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we began with a previously studied supported tetra-copper oxide nanocluster and systematically substituted its Cu sites with first-row transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn). This process allowed us to examine the catalytic activity of 162 MeO-NCs with a variety of geometric and electronic structures, leading to 12 new compositions that outperformed the base nanocluster. Exploring the structure–activity relationships with machine learning, our analysis uncovered correlations between the intrinsic electronic and structural properties of the nanoclusters and the free energy barriers for methane activation despite the challenges posed by the structural flexibility of these amorphous nanoclusters. The results offer insights into the optimization of MeO-NCs for methane activation. Additionally, we developed a clustering model capable of distinguishing high-performing nanoclusters from less effective ones with strong tolerance to the interference from the structural flexibility of these amorphous nanoclusters. These findings help narrow down the material design space for more time-consuming high-level quantum chemical calculations, offering a promising pathway toward advancing eco-friendly methane conversion.

Chiral 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidines are ubiquitous subunits in natural products, bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals, and chiral catalysts. However, their asymmetric synthesis still presents a formidable challenge. We herein report a rare example of diastereodivergent parallel kinetic resolution of racemic 2-substituted pyrrolidines via C(sp3)–H borylation. A vast array of enantioenriched cis- and trans-2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidines were obtained with high enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility was demonstrated by downstream transformations, including the synthesis of optically active pyrrolidine 197B and cis-pyrrolidine 225H.

Enantiopure γ-amino butyric acids (GABA) and derivatives have important applications in medicinal chemistry, especially for the treatment of central nervous system diseases. Many marketed drugs feature this moiety. In this context, we have developed a highly enantioselective catalytic strategy for rapidly forging β- or β,γ-substituted GABA derivatives by exploiting an unexplored ternary electron donor–acceptor (EDA) complex simultaneously driven by visible light and chiral Ni catalyst. With this cooperative catalytic system, a range of structurally diverse β- or β,γ-substituted GABA derivatives have been achieved in high yields with good enantio- and diastereoselectivities (up to 88% yield, >99% ee, >19:1 dr). Mechanistic studies indicate that the key to success is the dual role of the chiral Ni catalyst, which not only promotes the formation of ternary EDA complexes generated from redox-active esters, Hantzsch esters, and chiral Ni catalyst but can also precisely provide asymmetric induction. The synthetic benefits of this method were proved by enabling easy synthetic access to pharmaceuticals or related bioactive molecules such as pregabalin, baclofen, rolipram, and phenibut.

The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into formic acid (FA; HCOOH) in an aqueous phase is a promising method of realizing an environmentally friendly FA/CO2-mediated chemical hydrogen storage/supply cycle. Despite progress in the design of catalysts that operate under basic conditions, the development of efficient catalysts that operate under additive-free conditions lags behind owing to the difficulty in activating CO2 and the low solubility of CO2 in pure water. In the present study, we present a heterogeneous tandem catalysis strategy in which Co3O4 is used as a CO2 hydration cocatalyst to produce a HCO3– intermediate, in combination with our previously reported PdAg/TiO2 as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of HCO3– to afford FA. The turnover number based on Pd improved by a factor of more than 8 in the presence of the Co3O4 cocatalyst with a cubic particle morphology enclosed by (100) facets. A series of morphology-controlled Co3O4 cocatalysts was investigated to elucidate the effect of the exposed crystal facets (i.e., (100), (111), or (112)) on their physicochemical properties and catalytic activity in FA synthesis. A systematic comparison based on experimental and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the substantial enhancement effect of the Co3O4 cubes is attributable to the in situ generation of the largest amount of surface Co–OH groups with strong basicity originating from the exposed (100) facets. In addition, the present tandem catalytic system displayed high recyclability without exhibiting a structural change or a significant loss of activity. These findings will allow the rational design of an environmentally benign catalytic system for the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA.

Despite significant progress in the catalytic asymmetric 1,4-additions between various Michael donors and acceptors, the exploration of organohalide donors remains elusive. Herein, we report the Pd(0)-catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular 1,4-additions of vinyl/aryl iodides to α,β-unsaturated hydrazones, featuring in situ-formed hydrazone and acid/base-tuned reaction pathways. Due to its strong coordination ability, the hydrazone is capable of steering the C–C bond formation to follow the 1,4-addition mechanism instead of the conventional alkene insertion, thus enabling the generation of vinylhydrazinyl–Pd2+ species via the Zimmerman–Traxler chairlike transition state. Notably, this species preferentially undergoes protonation under acidic conditions, furnishing a reductive Heck reaction with the aid of a native hydrazine reductant, while it is susceptible to β-HN elimination under basic conditions to achieve a denitrogenative Heck reaction. The catalytic protocol affords highly enantioselective access to diverse heterocycles, with alkene and hydrazone groups poised for further chemical manipulations.

The development of synthetic methods for the selective installation of methyl and fluoromethyl groups is highly desired due to their critical role in drug development. While significant advances have been made in the methylation and difluoromethylation of aromatic compounds, the catalytic atroposelective (fluoro)methylative functionalization of alkynes to forge axially chiral alkenes remains underexploited. Herein, we report an enantioselective cross-electrophile strategy for the efficient 1,2-carbo-(fluoro)methylation of alkynes with two different alkyl halides via nickel catalysis. By integrating a one-electron radical process with a two-electron organometallic process, this protocol employs a simple chiral nickel catalyst to effectively discriminate between secondary and tertiary alkyl groups and (fluoro)methyl groups for alkyne difunctionalization. This protocol demonstrates good compatibility of activated secondary/tertiary alkyl bromides, terminal alkynes, and (fluoro)methyl halides, permitting the straightforward synthesis of a broad range of synthetically valuable axially chiral (fluoro)methyl-substituted alkenes with high chemo-, regio-, trans-, and atropo-selectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies provide insight into the potential reaction pathway.

Strong metal–support interactions (SMSI) typically induce the migration of a coverage layer to the metal surface accompanied by electron transfer, forming a unique metal–support interface. This dual modification in geometric and electronic structures reconstructs the active surface, adjusting the activity and stability of the catalyst. However, identifying and quantifying such newly formed interfacial sites remains a challenge. Herein, by varying the reduction temperature to control the TiO2–x coverage on Au nanoparticles, the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2 in 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) oxidation shows a volcano-shaped trend. Combined thiol titration and poisoning kinetics analysis to quantify the ratio of interfacial to surface sites and normalize it to intrinsic activity, revealing that Au-TiO2–x interfacial sites positively contribute to catalytic performance. This study offers valuable insights into the active sites in heterogeneous catalytic systems with SMSI effects.
