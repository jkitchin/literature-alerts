Supported gold nanoclusters of the formula [Au13(L)5Cl2]3+ where L = N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or phosphine ligands are examined in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) in a membrane electrode assembly cell configuration. Gold nanoclusters bearing bisNHC ligands are shown to exhibit improved catalytic performance compared with diphosphine-stabilized nanoclusters after activation at the optimum treatment temperatures. The thermal properties of the nanoclusters are shown to have a significant impact on their catalytic activity. Thermogravimetric analysis, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that thermal treatment of [Au13(diphosphine)5Cl2]3+ nanoclusters results in complete loss of diphosphine ligands while [Au13(bisNHC)5Cl2]3+ nanoclusters show stepwise and partial removal of bisNHC ligands. We propose that the partial removal of bisNHC ligands enables efficient activation of [Au13(bisNHC)5Cl2]3+ clusters while conserving the core structure. This leads to the implication that intact clusters retaining at least some ligands in their coordination environment are more active than ligand-free clusters.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) is a promising alternative to energy and environmentally intensive production. Bulk electronic and surface structures affect the charge transport efficiency and catalytic activity of the photoelectrode. Herein, we design and investigate a hematite (Fe2O3) nanorod photoelectrode with hafnium and titanium binary dopants for highly selective H2O2 production. The resultant photoanode shows a H2O2 yield of 0.41 μmol min–1 cm–2 at 1.5 VRHE with a Faradaic efficiency of 72.2%. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrate the synergistic effect of Hf and gradient Ti doping on the hematite for the promising H2O2 performance. Hf doping effectively improves the crystallinity of Fe2O3, which favors improving the charge transport and reducing the charge recombination. Gradient Ti doping inhibits the collapse of the nanorod structure, increases the specific surface area, and introduces a large number of active sites on the surface. Ti- and Hf-codoped Ti/Hf:Fe2O3 photoanode improves the kinetics of H2O2 generation, leading to the high selectivity for H2O2 production and suppression of O2 production. This work provides the importance of hematite-based photoanodes toward the regulation of competition reactions for H2O2 production.

Many enzymes display non-Arrhenius behavior with curved Arrhenius plots in the absence of denaturation. There has been significant debate about the origin of this behavior and recently the role of the activation heat capacity (ΔCP⧧) has been widely discussed. If enzyme-catalyzed reactions occur with appreciable negative values of ΔCP⧧ (arising from narrowing of the conformational space along the reaction coordinate), then curved Arrhenius plots are a consequence. To investigate these phenomena in detail, we have collected high precision temperature-rate data over a wide temperature interval for a model glycosidase enzyme MalL, and a series of mutants that change the temperature-dependence of the enzyme-catalyzed rate. We use these data to test a range of models including macromolecular rate theory (MMRT) and an equilibrium model. In addition, we have performed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the conformational landscape traversed by MalL in the enzyme–substrate complex and an enzyme-transition state complex. We have crystallized the enzyme in a transition state-like conformation in the absence of a ligand and determined an X-ray crystal structure at very high resolution (1.10 Å). We show (using simulation) that this enzyme-transition state conformation has a more restricted conformational landscape than the wildtype enzyme. We coin the term “transition state-like conformation (TLC)” to apply to this state of the enzyme. Together, these results imply a cooperative conformational transition between an enzyme–substrate conformation (ES) and a transition-state-like conformation (TLC) that precedes the chemical step. We present a two-state model as an extension of MMRT (MMRT-2S) that describes the data along with a convenient approximation with linear temperature dependence of the activation heat capacity (MMRT-1L) that can be used where fewer data points are available. Our model rationalizes disparate behavior seen for MalL and previous results for a thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase and is consistent with a raft of data for other enzymes. Our model can be used to characterize the conformational changes required for enzyme catalysis and provides insights into the role of cooperative conformational changes in transition state stabilization that are accompanied by changes in heat capacity for the system along the reaction coordinate. TLCs are likely to be of wide importance in understanding the temperature dependence of enzyme activity and other aspects of enzyme catalysis.

Asymmetric reductive three-component arylalkylation of alkenes via the radical relay method has been well established, while asymmetric arylalkylation via the migratory insertion strategy remains unexplored. We report enantioselective nickel-catalyzed cross-electrophile arylalkylation of alkenes with aryl- and alkyl halides via an integrated Heck carbometalation/radical cross-coupling sequence. This protocol employing a chiral Ni/PHOX catalytic system allows terminal and internal alkenes to successfully engage the arylalkylation with exquisite control of regio-, chemo-, and stereoselectivity. More importantly, this reductive arylalkylation undergoes regio- and enantioselective arylnickelation followed by radical cross-coupling via Csp3–Csp3 reductive elimination, thus exhibiting reverse regioselectivity to the radical relay method. Mild reaction conditions and exceptional functional group tolerance facilitate this method’s compatibility with bioactive motifs and the modular synthesis of biologically active compounds. The control experiments and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the mechanism and origin of regio- and stereoselectivity, and the hemilabile nature of the PHOX ligand is critical for achieving this enantioselective arylalkylation.

The various isomers of hydroxyproline (HP) are widely distributed in nature, serving as key components of structural proteins, while their quaternized betaine derivatives function as osmoprotectants in many organisms. Aerobic bacteria degrade HPs through a variety of well-studied mechanisms. Recent studies show that certain anaerobic bacteria degrade HPs through distinct mechanisms, involving the O2-sensitive glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) t4L-HP dehydratase (HypD) and t4D-HP C–N lyase (HplG). Here, we report the discovery of two more GREs, N-methyl c4L-HP dehydratase (HpyG) and N-methyl c4D-HP dehydratase (HpzG), which catalyze radical-mediated dehydration of the two N-methyl-c4HP enantiomers, while also displaying significant activities toward their unmethylated substrates. Both GREs are associated with homologues of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, which catalyze reduction of their products N-methyl-pyrroline-5-carboxylate to form N-methyl-proline. Crystal structures of HpyG and HpzG in complex with their substrates revealed active site architectures distinct from that of HypD and provided insights into the mechanism of enantioselective radical-mediated dehydration. Our research further expands the repertoire of diverse chemical mechanisms involved in the bacterial metabolism of highly prevalent HP isomers and derivatives in the anaerobic biosphere.

Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (eN2OR) has emerged as a sustainable strategy for nitrogen fixation. In this work, density functional theory calculations were performed to rationalize the reaction mechanisms, activity, and selectivity of eN2OR on metal dioxides. The anatase (101), anatase (100), and rutile (110) surfaces were investigated to obtain more generalized insights. Based on the reaction phase diagram analysis, the thermochemical mechanisms were identified as most energetically favorable for N2 and *N2O oxidation, and a theoretical activity map was constructed for eN2OR, explaining well the experimental activity trend. Anatase PtO2(100) was screened as the most active catalyst for nitrate production, which could be covered by a monolayer of *OH under the reaction conditions according to the Pourbaix diagram. A method of electric field controlling constant potential was used to calculate the electrochemical barriers on anatase PtO2(100). It was found that the electrochemical barriers of the oxygen evolution reaction will increase with the decrease of potential, while the thermochemical limiting step of the eN2OR is insensitive to potential. Thus, the eN2OR selectivity can be improved by lowering the applied potential. This work unveils fundamental insights into eN2OR and provides a unified understanding to experiments.

Oxyfunctionalization of abundant carboxylic acids represents a direct approach to synthesizing α-hydroxy acids, which are valuable intermediates of various active pharmaceutical ingredients. Although ideal, the transformation is yet to be accomplished. Herein, enantiocomplementary C(sp3)–H oxyfunctionalization for the synthesis of α-hydroxy acids was realized by a cooperative strategy of substrate engineering, homologue screening and protein engineering of α-ketoglutarate-dependent nonheme iron aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases. The reaction provided concise synthetic routes toward three types of 67 α-hydroxy acids with high efficiency and selectivity (yield up to 90% and ee up to >99%). The distinctive complementary reactions add to a growing repertoire of biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization reactions.

The exhaustion of fossil fuels and resultant pollution issues have prompted the world to look to clean, nonpolluting hydrogen energy. The promising approach of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) presents a solution for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Consequently, creating high-performance and cost-effective electrocatalysts is essential for the efficient decomposition of water. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has emerged as the most promising among potential electrocatalysts to replace platinum. However, only the edge-site of MoS2 is active for HER due to the MoS2 semiconductive nature and large inactive basal planes. Doping various substances, which significantly improves HER activity, can enhance MoS2's physical and chemical properties. Our Review encapsulates the latest strategies and research advancements in choosing heteroatomic-doped MoS2 for hydrogen production. Various doping elements impart unique physical and chemical properties to MoS2. Specifically, doping with noble metals (e.g., Ag, Pt, Ru, Pd, Rh) and transition metals (e.g., Fe, V, Ni, Mn, Co, Zn, W), as well as codoping with multiple metal atoms (e.g., Cu-Pd, Pt-Te, Co-Nb, Ni-Co), can significantly enhance conductivity and introduce new active sites. These dopants are recognized for activating the basal plane of MoS2, thereby enhancing the HER activity. Furthermore, doping with nonmetallic elements (e.g., N, F, P, An, O) and their codoping combinations (e.g., O-P, N-F, Se-O), as well as the codoping of nonmetal and metal atoms (e.g., Co-Se, Co-P, N-Pt, Ru-O), is crucial for inducing phase conversions and improving stability. Each dopant contributes distinctively, either by enhancing the stability of MoS2, serving as a catalytic site, or broadening the pH range for effective HER. In this discussion, we further explore the current challenges and outlook of this promising area. Furthermore, we discuss existing challenges and promising guidelines for future research on the MoS2-based catalyst, offering advice to translation from laboratory research to large-scale industrial hydrogen production.
