For a catalyst to be efficient and durable, it is crucial that the reaction products do not poison the catalyst. In the case of the Haber–Bosch process, the rate-limiting step is believed to be the decomposition of nitrogen molecules on the Fe(111) surface. This step leads to the production on the surface of atomic nitrogen (N*), which, unless hydrogenated and eventually released as ammonia, remains adsorbed and occupies the active sites. Thus, it is important to ascertain how a high N* coverage affects the nitrogen dissociative chemisorption. To answer this question, we study the properties of the Fe(111) surface at different N* coverage both at room and operando temperature. In the latter regime, we have already found that Fe surface atoms exhibit a high mobility, promoting the formation of adatoms and vacancies, and causing the catalytic centers to acquire a finite lifetime [Bonati et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 2023, 120 (50), e2313023120]. We discover that the N* coverage reduces but does not eliminate the iron mobility. Remarkably, the N* atoms stabilize triangular surface structures associated with the formation of vacancies, which are a sign of a frustrated drive toward a more stable Fe4N phase. As a consequence, nitrogen atoms tend to cluster, reducing their poisoning effect. At the same time, the reduction in the number of catalytic centers is counteracted by an increase in their lifetime. The combined effect is that the dissociation barrier is not significantly altered in the range of coverages studied. These results bring to light the complex role that dynamics plays in catalytic reactivity under operando conditions.

Iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are difficult to achieve because they usually require a highly reactive, low-valent iron catalyst to undergo the oxidative addition process. Here, we report a method for light-promoted iron-catalyzed C–N coupling reactions between aryl bromides and amines in the presence of a catalytic amount of a bipyridine ligand under irradiation at 390–395 nm. This method, which does not require external photosensitizers, features a broad substrate scope (70 examples) and good functional group tolerance, providing a platform for the development of iron-catalyzed coupling reactions in organic synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that an organic base and light are crucial for the generation of an Fe(I) species and that the reaction involves an Fe(I)/Fe(III) catalytic cycle.

Reactant spillover and electronic effects are two indistinguishable factors that influence MoO3 promoters in benzene hydrogenation on Pt-MoO3 catalysts. Previous studies have primarily focused on the significance of hydrogen spillover while neglecting the transfer of benzene and the electronic effect originating from MoO3. Herein, we synthesized Pt/CNT, Pt–Mo1/CNT with Mo single atoms, and Pt–Mocluster/CNT with MoOx cluster promoters by using atomic layer deposition. The catalyst Pt–Mo1/CNT exhibited higher activity (3361.8 h–1) in benzene hydrogenation at 50 °C, which was twice as high as that of Pt/CNT. In contrast, the presence of closely interacting MoOx clusters with Pt nanoparticles inhibited the activity of the Pt catalyst. Kinetic experiments, DFT calculations, in situ FTIR, and AIMD simulations revealed that Mo single atoms on multiwalled carbon nanotubes did not alter the structure or electronic state of Pt nanoparticles but enhanced their activity by increasing benzene coverage via benzene spillover. On the other hand, although the hydrogen and benzene coverage increased with MoOx cluster promoters, changes in the electronic state of Pt nanoparticles resulted in a higher energy barrier for the rate-determining step.

Isolated platinum(II) ions anchored at acid sites in the pores of zeolite HZSM-5, initially introduced by aqueous ion exchange, were reduced to form platinum nanoparticles that are stably dispersed with a narrow size distribution (1.3 ± 0.4 nm in average diameter). The nanoparticles were confined in reservoirs within the porous zeolite particles, as shown by electron beam tomography and the shape-selective catalysis of alkene hydrogenation. When the nanoparticles were oxidatively fragmented in dry air at elevated temperature, platinum returned to its initial in-pore atomically dispersed state with a charge of +2, as shown previously by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results determine the conditions under which platinum is retained within the pores of HZSM-5 particles during redox cycles that are characteristic of the reductive conditions of catalyst operation and the oxidative conditions of catalyst regeneration.

Electrosynthesis of NH3 from nitrate anion (NO3–) reduction (NO3–RR) is a cascade reaction, which is considered a great potential alternative to the Haber–Bosch route to reduce CO2 emissions and alleviate the adverse effects of excessive NO3– contamination in the environment. Frequently, solid solution alloys (SSAs) with a single-phase active site may struggle to fully utilize their benefits during the entire process of nitrate (NO3–) reduction, which involves multiple intermediate reactions. In this study, we showed that by separating Cu and Ni in a Janus Cu@Ni catalyst structure, we can achieve high performance in NO3–RR, yielding a high Faradaic efficiency (92.5%) and a production rate of NH3 (1127 mmol h–1 g–1) at −0.2 V versus RHE, compared to CuNi SSA (82.6%, 264 mmol h–1 g–1). Here, we demonstrate that a Janus Cu@Ni catalyst with short-range ordered catalytic sites favors the adsorption of NO through a bridge-bond mode. Simultaneously, a hydrogen spillover process was observed, in which Ni dissociates H2O to generate *H which spontaneously migrates to adjacent catalytic sites to hydrogenate the *NOx intermediates. This facilitates N–O bond cleavage, resulting in the NH3 production rate nearly 5 times higher than that of CuNi SSA, where NO was linearly bonded on its surface. The study of this catalytic effect, a cooperative tandem enhancement, provides insights into the design of multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts for electrochemical NH3 synthesis.

The utilization of different energy carriers to efficiently store and release energy plays a vital role in the pursuit of a renewable energy paradigm. In this context, we present an interesting system utilizing morpholine as a dual-functional agent in the reversible hydrogenation of CO2 to formamides employing an atomically dispersed iridium (Ir) catalyst. Morpholine serves as a stabilizer during CO2 hydrogenation and a CO2 capture agent during dehydrogenation, enabling a carbon-neutral cycle for hydrogen storage. Notably, these reversible cycles could be facilitated by the same catalyst and maintained under identical temperature conditions by a simple H2 pressure swing. The robustness of this system is underscored by its consistent performance across multiple charging–discharging cycles without a noticeable reduction in the storage capacity. Additionally, the Ir catalyst exhibits strong CO tolerance during hydrogenation, making it suitable for purifying crude hydrogen via the reversible process.

Thermal catalytic dehydrogenation of congested alkanes, such as the 1,1-disubstituted ethane (1,1-DSE) motif, is still a largely unsolved challenge. Herein, we report the investigation of biaryl-based atropisomeric diphosphines with various electronic and steric properties and their corresponding chloroiridium complexes for catalytic transfer dehydrogenation (CTD) of 1,1-DSEs using tert-butylethene as H-acceptor. The use of diphosphines of the biaryl backbone with a narrow dihedral angle was found to be essential to forming an effective catalytic species, cis-P2ClIr. A systematic investigation of three atropisomeric diphosphine classes, Segphos, MeO-Biphep, and Binap, revealed that the sterically hindered and electron-rich ligands are more efficient than the less hindered and electron-deficient ones. With an understanding of the structure–activity relationships, we developed two highly encumbered ligands 3,5-TMS,4-MeOMeO-Biphep (M12) and 3-TIPS,5-TMSMeO-Biphep (M13), which afforded >1400 turnovers at 150 °C in the cumene/TBE CTD reaction, representing the most efficient catalyst for thermal catalytic dehydrogenation of 1,1-DSEs. Moreover, these two ligands produced ∼420 turnovers in the CTD of 2-(1-adamantyl)propane, demonstrating their ability in dehydrogenation of unactivated hindered dialkyl-substituted ethanes.
