A Markovnikov-selective radical hydrochalcogenation reaction of unactivated alkenes via iron-catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer was reported. Using N-(arylsulfenyl)arenesulfonamide, PhSO2SCD3, S-alkyl thiosulfonate, S-alkyl dithiosulfonate and Ebselen derivatives as versatile radicalophiles, a wide range of unsymmetrical alkyl-aryl, dialkyl and SCD3 (D > 99%) containing sulfides, dialkyl disulfides, as well as organoselenides have been collectively synthesized under mild conditions. As a powerful alternative to the classical thiol–ene reaction, this protocol features exclusive Markovnikov selectivity, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. A number of radical probe experiments suggest the hydrochalcogenation proceeds through the radical pathway. The synthetic utility of this transformation was also demonstrated through the late-stage modifications of diverse natural products and bioactive molecules.

The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into formic acid (FA; HCOOH) in an aqueous phase is a promising method of realizing an environmentally friendly FA/CO2-mediated chemical hydrogen storage/supply cycle. Despite progress in the design of catalysts that operate under basic conditions, the development of efficient catalysts that operate under additive-free conditions lags behind owing to the difficulty in activating CO2 and the low solubility of CO2 in pure water. In the present study, we present a heterogeneous tandem catalysis strategy in which Co3O4 is used as a CO2 hydration cocatalyst to produce a HCO3– intermediate, in combination with our previously reported PdAg/TiO2 as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of HCO3– to afford FA. The turnover number based on Pd improved by a factor of more than 8 in the presence of the Co3O4 cocatalyst with a cubic particle morphology enclosed by (100) facets. A series of morphology-controlled Co3O4 cocatalysts was investigated to elucidate the effect of the exposed crystal facets (i.e., (100), (111), or (112)) on their physicochemical properties and catalytic activity in FA synthesis. A systematic comparison based on experimental and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the substantial enhancement effect of the Co3O4 cubes is attributable to the in situ generation of the largest amount of surface Co–OH groups with strong basicity originating from the exposed (100) facets. In addition, the present tandem catalytic system displayed high recyclability without exhibiting a structural change or a significant loss of activity. These findings will allow the rational design of an environmentally benign catalytic system for the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA.

Despite significant progress in the catalytic asymmetric 1,4-additions between various Michael donors and acceptors, the exploration of organohalide donors remains elusive. Herein, we report the Pd(0)-catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular 1,4-additions of vinyl/aryl iodides to α,β-unsaturated hydrazones, featuring in situ-formed hydrazone and acid/base-tuned reaction pathways. Due to its strong coordination ability, the hydrazone is capable of steering the C–C bond formation to follow the 1,4-addition mechanism instead of the conventional alkene insertion, thus enabling the generation of vinylhydrazinyl–Pd2+ species via the Zimmerman–Traxler chairlike transition state. Notably, this species preferentially undergoes protonation under acidic conditions, furnishing a reductive Heck reaction with the aid of a native hydrazine reductant, while it is susceptible to β-HN elimination under basic conditions to achieve a denitrogenative Heck reaction. The catalytic protocol affords highly enantioselective access to diverse heterocycles, with alkene and hydrazone groups poised for further chemical manipulations.

The development of synthetic methods for the selective installation of methyl and fluoromethyl groups is highly desired due to their critical role in drug development. While significant advances have been made in the methylation and difluoromethylation of aromatic compounds, the catalytic atroposelective (fluoro)methylative functionalization of alkynes to forge axially chiral alkenes remains underexploited. Herein, we report an enantioselective cross-electrophile strategy for the efficient 1,2-carbo-(fluoro)methylation of alkynes with two different alkyl halides via nickel catalysis. By integrating a one-electron radical process with a two-electron organometallic process, this protocol employs a simple chiral nickel catalyst to effectively discriminate between secondary and tertiary alkyl groups and (fluoro)methyl groups for alkyne difunctionalization. This protocol demonstrates good compatibility of activated secondary/tertiary alkyl bromides, terminal alkynes, and (fluoro)methyl halides, permitting the straightforward synthesis of a broad range of synthetically valuable axially chiral (fluoro)methyl-substituted alkenes with high chemo-, regio-, trans-, and atropo-selectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies provide insight into the potential reaction pathway.

Strong metal–support interactions (SMSI) typically induce the migration of a coverage layer to the metal surface accompanied by electron transfer, forming a unique metal–support interface. This dual modification in geometric and electronic structures reconstructs the active surface, adjusting the activity and stability of the catalyst. However, identifying and quantifying such newly formed interfacial sites remains a challenge. Herein, by varying the reduction temperature to control the TiO2–x coverage on Au nanoparticles, the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2 in 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) oxidation shows a volcano-shaped trend. Combined thiol titration and poisoning kinetics analysis to quantify the ratio of interfacial to surface sites and normalize it to intrinsic activity, revealing that Au-TiO2–x interfacial sites positively contribute to catalytic performance. This study offers valuable insights into the active sites in heterogeneous catalytic systems with SMSI effects.

Reductive amination is one of the most synthetically direct routes to access chiral amines. Several Imine Reductases (IREDs) have been discovered to catalyze reductive amination (Reductive Aminases or RedAms), yet they are dependent on the expensive phosphorylated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor NADPH and usually more active at basic pH. Here, we describe the discovery and synthetic potential of an IRED from Rhodococcus erythropolis (RytRedAm) that catalyzes reductive amination between a series of medium to large carbonyl and amine compounds with conversions of up to >99% and 99% enantiomeric excess at neutral pH. RytRedAm catalyzes the formation of a substituted γ-lactam and N-methyl-1-phenylethanamine with stereochemistry opposite to that of fungal RedAms, giving the (S)-enantiomer. This enzyme remarkably uses both NADPH and NADH cofactors with KM values of 15 and 247 μM and turnover numbers kcat of 3.6 and 9.0 s–1, respectively, for the reductive amination of hexanal with allylamine. The crystal structure obtained provides insights into the flexibility to also accept NADH, with residues R35 and I69 diverging from that of other IREDs/RedAms in the otherwise conserved Rossmann fold. RytRedAm thus represents a subfamily of enzymes that enable synthetic applications using NADH-dependent reductive amination to access complementary chiral amine products.

Aryl ethers are ubiquitous protecting groups of alcohols and amines in organic chemistry. This is owed to the simplicity of their appendage to molecules and the robust protection afforded. However, aryl ethers and amines can be challenging to cleave, often requiring harsh and unselective reductive conditions. We report the structure-based engineering of a promiscuous, ether-cleaving vanillyl alcohol oxidase-type biocatalyst for activity on a wide range of para-hydroxy benzyl ethers. Two superior quadruple mutants are identified with improved kinetics and substrate scope. One evolved variant and two predecessors are crystallized, and their structures resolved to 2.8–1.5 Å, revealing a significant increase in the volume and flexibility of the active site cavity. To illustrate the potential usefulness of the engineered biocatalysts, one is later coupled with another biocatalyst in a cascade reaction to catalyze the selective cleavage of an uncommon aryl ether protecting group, para-acyloxy benzyl ethers, in good yield and under mild conditions.

We herein describe the high-valent cobalt-catalyzed C(sp3)–H functionalization of amide derivatives with silver acetylides generated in situ. The reaction proceeds under kinetic control at 60 °C, with a catalyst loading of 5 mol %. These extraordinarily mild conditions for Co-catalysis enable the synthesis of 5-(Z)-ethylidene pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives in good yield and selectivity. Density functional theory calculations have revealed a unique mechanism involving Co–Ag bimetallic species, rationalizing the nature of the catalytically active species and the role of each additive.

Merging efficient H2 generation with high-value utilization of biomass via a solar-driven catalytic redox technology presents a promising strategy for overall biorefinery. As the most abundant aromatic polymer in nature, lignin is considered an ideal sacrificial agent to enhance the reductive H2 evolution, coproducing high-value aromatic chemicals/fuels instead of waste carbon oxides. However, the development of an energy-efficient and productive photocatalysis system remains challenging. Herein, a photothermal cocatalytic technology was developed for synergistic enhancement on the redox activities. A feasible synthesis method was proposed to precisely construct a light-sensitive heterojunction between active Pt and NixP, bridged by technical lignin–carbon. Benefiting from the advanced modulation effect of lignin–carbon, accelerated electron transfer and active structural rearrangement were realized on the defective catalyst surface. Combining an optimized band gap structure, H2 evolution efficiency was boosted under photothermal cocatalysis and showed a splendid H2 evolution rate of 10.7 mmol·gcat–1·h–1 based on a lignin-derived monomer (vanillyl alcohol), 15-fold higher than either photocatalysis or thermocatalysis alone. The H2 evolution obtained from technical lignin (2.9 mmol·gcat–1·h–1) surpassed the existing level of biomass. Meanwhile, the controllable coupling of lignin or its derived monomers was enhanced simultaneously, yielding C13–C16 dimers (43.8% yield) from the lignin-derived monomer via Cα node, which act as ideal precursors for jet fuel. This work advances lignin upgrading for hydrogen energy and biofuels.

The biological formation of nitrogen–nitrogen (N–N) bonds represents intriguing reactions that have attracted much attention in the past decade. This interest has led to an increasing number of N–N bond-containing natural products (NPs) and related enzymes that catalyze their formation (referred to in this review as NNzymes) being elucidated and studied in greater detail. While more detailed information on the biosynthesis of N–N bond-containing NPs, which has only become available in recent years, provides an unprecedented source of biosynthetic enzymes, their potential for biocatalytic applications has been minimally explored. With this review, we aim not only to provide a comprehensive overview of both characterized NNzymes and hypothetical biocatalysts with putative N–N bond forming activity, but also to highlight the potential of NNzymes from a biocatalytic perspective. We also present and compare conventional synthetic approaches to linear and cyclic hydrazines, hydrazides, diazo- and nitroso-groups, triazenes, and triazoles to allow comparison with enzymatic routes via NNzymes to these N–N bond-containing functional groups. Moreover, the biosynthetic pathways as well as the diversity and reaction mechanisms of NNzymes are presented according to the direct functional groups currently accessible to these enzymes.

Buchwald–Hartwig (BH) aminations are crucial for synthesizing arylamine motifs in numerous bioactive molecules and fine chemicals. While homogeneous palladium complexes can be effective catalysts, their high costs and environmental impact motivate the search for alternative approaches. Heterogeneous palladium single-atom catalysts (SAC) offer promising recoverable alternatives in C–C cross-couplings. Yet their use in C–N couplings remains unexplored, and mechanistic insights into amine coupling with aryl halides over solid surfaces that could guide catalyst design are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that palladium atoms coordinated to well-defined heptazinic cavities of graphitic carbon nitride (Pd1@C3N4) deliver practically relevant yields for BH couplings across various aryl halides and amines, exhibiting persistent activity and negligible leaching over several cycles. Notably, Pd1@C3N4 shows comparable or superior activity with certain aryl chlorides to bromides, alongside high chemoselectivity for amines over amides. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses supported by density functional theory simulations identify the concerted role of the ligand and the C3N4 host in determining the performance, with a Pd(II) nominal oxidation state observed under all coupling conditions. Complementary structural and kinetic studies highlight a distinct reaction mechanism than that typically reported for homogeneous catalysts. These findings offer key insights for designing recyclable SAC for BH coupling, setting the basis for extending the scope toward more complex industrial targets.

Iron plays a central and critical role in the water oxidation mechanism and the activity of transition-metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides. Tracking Fe dynamics (deposition/dissolution/electrolyte transport) and unraveling the chemistries of various Fe active sites under oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) conditions are important for catalyst design, particularly for applications in alkaline electrolysis. Here, we use CoOxHy thin films as a platform to investigate Fe transport and reactivity at the catalyst-electrolyte interface and its impact on OER activity. We find that the deposition/dissolution of the surface-absorbed Fe species is governed by the transport of soluble Fe species and applied potential. Soluble Fe species in the electrolyte adsorb on CoOxHy under stirred electrolyte conditions. Accelerated Fe desorption is observed with a more-positive OER potential. The surface-localized Fe sites generated by absorption from soluble Fe species have a higher OER turnover frequency (TOFFe) compared to Fe in codeposited CoFeOxHy films. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows structural similarity between reference Fe oxyhydroxides and surface Fe sites on CoOxHy, contrasting with Fe sites within the CoOxHy structure made by codeposition, where Fe shows a different apparent X-ray absorption edge energy. The OER activity of the surface-absorbed Fe decreased by Fe desorption but was recoverable by redepositing Fe species under non-OER conditions.

Aryl aldehydes are key synthetic intermediates in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients. They are generated on scale (>1000 kg) through the palladium-catalyzed formylation of aryl bromides using syngas (CO/H2). The best-in-class catalyst system for this reaction employs di-1-adamantyl-n-butylphosphine (cataCXium A), palladium(II) acetate, and tetramethylethylenediamine. Despite nearly 20 years since its initial report, a mechanistic understanding of this system remains incomplete. Here, we use automation, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations to develop a mechanistic model for this best-in-class catalyst. We suggest that a combination of the migratory insertion step and dihydrogen activation step is likely involved in the turnover-limiting sequence. The reaction kinetics are responsive to the nature of the substrate, with electron-rich aryl bromides reacting faster and more selectively than their electron-poor counterparts due to the influence of electronics in the migratory insertion step. Our findings add additional insight into the proposed mechanism of palladium-catalyzed formylation of aryl bromides.

A Ni-catalyzed enantioconvergent cross-coupling between β-bromostyrenes and secondary Grignard reagents is reported. This C(sp2)–C(sp3) cross-coupling is applicable to a broad range of electrophilic and nucleophilic partners and affords the products in good to high levels of enantio-induction. Experimental mechanistic investigations revealed an unexpected binding mode of the chiral (P,N) ligand and support a radical rebound mechanism involving in-cage radicals. Kinetic experiments provide evidence for an off-cycle resting state featuring dinuclear species. Computational analyses are in line with this hypothesis and coherent with a catalytic cycle proceeding via a Ni(I)/Ni(III) manifold. They further suggest an enantio-determining radical capture event and shed light on the origin of the Dynamic Kinetic Resolution process.
