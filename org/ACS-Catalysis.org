Structural metamorphosis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) eliciting highly active metal-hydroxide catalysts has come to the fore lately, with much promise. However, the role of organic ligands leaching into electrolytes during alkaline hydrolysis remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the influence of organic carboxylate anions on a family of Ni or NiFe-based hydroxide type catalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction. After excluding interfering variables, i.e., electrolyte purity, Ohmic loss, and electrolyte pH, the experimental results indicate that adding organic anions to the electrolyte profoundly impacts the redox potential of the Ni species versus with only a negligible effect on the oxygen evolution activities. In-depth studies demonstrate plausible reasons behind those observations and allude to far-reaching implications in controlling electrocatalysis in MOFs, mainly where compositional modularity entails fine-tuning organic anions.

Strategies incorporating heterometals to introduce surface-active hydrogen (*H) have been extensively utilized to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts in the nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR). However, a comprehensive understanding of *H behavior and its specific impact on regulating the NitRR pathway remains elusive, particularly in a quantitative manner. In this study, we prepared a group of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as model catalysts with diverse *H concentrations and lifetimes. Our findings reveal that the NitRR activity of Cu-based LDHs is highly dependent on the *H species that could be modulated by the incorporated heterometallic sites. Specifically, we conducted in situ analysis of different Cu-based LDH catalysts using time-resolved scanning electrochemical microscopy. The surface concentration and lifetime of *H at various applied potentials were quantified, enabling us to establish the relationship between the *H behavior and NitRR performance. Therefore, optimal NitRR performance was achieved with CuNi-LDHs, exhibiting a faradaic efficiency of 94.6% and yield rate of 2.7 mg h–1 cm–2 because of its appropriate *H surface concentration and lifetime. Additionally, we observe a trend of CuNi > CuCo > Cu > CuRu > CuFe > CuMg in terms of the faradaic efficiency for NH3 production. These results suggest that by effectively utilizing the stable *H produced by the catalyst, one would allow favorable NitRR performance, offering a promising strategy for other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.
