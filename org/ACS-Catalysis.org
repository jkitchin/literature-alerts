A catalytic protocol has been developed to access Fischer carbene nickel complexes using acylsilanes as stable and readily available precursors. The as-generated Fischer carbene complexes exhibit versatile reactivity, including cyclopropanation with alkenes, α-C–H insertion reactions, and two-component C–H addition to norbornene, which demonstrates the broad utility of the nickel(0)/acylsilane system for the catalytic applications of Fischer carbene complexes.

While alkenylborons have emerged as powerful precursors for the stereospecific construction of substituted alkenes, efficient synthetic methods toward stereodefined trisubstituted alkenylborons remain limited. Herein, we report a modular and practical approach for the stereoselective synthesis of E-trisubstituted alkenylborons through the nickel-catalyzed three-component reductive coupling of two readily available carbon electrophiles with an ethynyl-Bdan reagent. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing expedient access to a variety of trisubstituted alkenylborons with exclusive E-selectivity. The work demonstrates the possibility of applying ethynyl-Bdan as a type of boron reagent in organic synthesis.

Due to the unique properties of rare-earth (RE) metals, RE catalysts demonstrate distinctive catalytic performance in hydrogenation and related transformations. In typical RE catalytic systems, the roles and function modes have been studied and are relevant to ligands. In recent years, heterobimetallic catalytic systems have emerged for efficient hydrogenation and related transformations. Among these systems, heterobimetallic catalysts with transition metal (TM)-RE combinations integrate the characteristics of TM catalysis and RE catalysis, exhibiting a TM-RE bifunctional effect with remarkable activity and selectivity. However, the roles of RE metals in TM-RE bifunctional catalysis remain ambiguous. This theoretical study takes the Ni–Y system as a study case, aiming to elucidate the significant roles of the RE center in the TM-RE bifunctional effect on catalytic alkyne semihydrogenation. The results suggest that dynamic coordination can occur at the Y center due to its large size and coordination ability, which accepts the binding of phosphine groups of the ligand. The dynamic coordination of phosphine groups to the large-size RE center assists the Ni center in releasing vacant sites for substrate in-cage binding and reduces the steric effect on the Ni center. Meanwhile, the Lewis acidic RE center can stabilize the bridging hydride, which is crucial for H2 activation and hydrogenation. The TM-RE bifunctional effect promotes the reaction. During the H2 activation stage, due to the stabilization of nickel hydrides by yttrium, the fac-pathway is more favored. The Ni–H–Y bridging structure is maintained during the initial hydride insertion in the semihydrogenation stage, which is crucial for the reaction. Additionally, the use of the more active terminal hydride makes the terminal hydride pathway a more plausible mechanism. Benefiting from the capability of yttrium to accept the dynamic coordination of phosphine groups, thereby releasing steric hindrance and stabilizing the bridging hydride concurrently, (Z)/(E)-isomerization can proceed to achieve (E)-selectivity through the H2-assisted Ni–Y bifunctional pathway with a relatively low energy barrier. Owing to the RE-bridging hydride stabilization effect, the thermodynamic properties of intermediates are closely related to the size of the RE metal center, thereby influencing the activity and the (Z)/(E)-selectivity. These results underscore the important roles of the RE center in TM-RE bifunctional catalysis, offering valuable insights into the future design of effective bifunctional TM-RE catalysts.

5-Amino-1-pentanol (APO) is an important nitrogen-containing chemical with versatile applications. However, its synthesis is still not efficient. Here, we report the synthesis of APO from biomass-derived furfurylamine (FAM) via the direct cleavage of its α–C–O bond neighboring the −CH2NH2 group at ambient temperature. Pt/TiO2 catalysts exhibited high efficiency and stability in the FAM hydrogenolysis to APO, affording a high yield of 85.4% at 30 °C and 2.0 MPa of H2 in water. The high efficiency of Pt/TiO2 was found to be related to its superior activity for the cleavage of the α–C–O bond in FAM, relative to the hydrogenation of the furan ring on the corner and edge sites of the Pt surfaces. This work provides a viable approach for the precise cleavage of the α–C–O bond neighboring the −CH2NH2 group in the furan ring under mild conditions toward the efficient production of APO and its derivatives.

The catalytic hydrogen transfer (CHT) cascade reaction coupling alcohols with nitro compounds to synthesize imines is highly significant due to its remarkable efficiency and atom economy. However, the complicated multistep reaction process makes single-site catalysts exhibit unsatisfactory catalytic performance for the CHT cascade reaction. Herein, inspired by the findings of DFT calculations that Co nanocluster (CoNC) and Co single atom (CoSA) can act as the optimal active sites for alcohol oxidation and nitro reduction, respectively, one dual-active site catalyst (CoSA-CoNC/CN), containing CoSA and CoNC sites, was synthesized by a two-step vacuum pyrolysis strategy. Benefiting from the relay-like tandem catalysis of CoNC and CoSA, CoSA-CoNC/CN achieved an impressive 93% nitrobenzene conversion and 99% imine selectivity at 160 °C in 4 h, with a record turnover frequency of 20.9 h–1. This work provides insights into the functions of single-atom and nanocluster active sites in the CHT cascade reaction and sheds light on the rational preparation of tandem catalysts.

The catalytic asymmetric transformation of nitrogen atoms to prepare heterocyclic molecules is of significant value in organic synthesis and biological applications. Here, we disclose the activation of the nitrogen atom in hydrazine-derived hydrazone via an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organic catalyst for highly enantioselective formal cycloaddition reactions. The range of NHC catalysis extends across several (carbon and hetero) atoms and diverse chemical bonds (C═N and N–N bonds) to activate nitrogen atoms at remote sites with excellent reactivity and (stereo)selectivity control. Our strategy for nitrogen atom activation, along with the NHC-bound diaza-diene intermediate generated during the catalytic process, offers alternative solutions for organic synthesis.
