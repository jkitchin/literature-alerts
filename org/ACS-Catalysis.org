During the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), interstitial proton intercalation readily occurs in some transition metal oxide (TMO) catalysts and changes their d-band electronic structure. This work fabricated phosphorus (P)-doped tungsten oxide (WO3) with enriched oxygen vacancies (OVs) to study the impact of proton intercalation and heteroatom doping on eNRR and HER. Our results demonstrated that the electronic structure of the P-OV-WO3 catalyst was altered by in situ proton intercalation as indicated by the greater negative onset potential of eNRR at −0.05 V compared to the proton intercalation potential of 0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Compared to the non-P-doped WO3, the introduction of P doping in WO3 (e.g., 4.8 at. %) led to a reduction of more than 36% in proton intercalation. As a result, the HER activity of the P-OV-WO3 was significantly suppressed, as demonstrated by a considerably negative shift of the onset HER potential from −0.06 to −0.15 V and a slower HER kinetics with the Tafel slope increased from 129.0 to 343.1 mV/dec. Density functional theory calculations revealed the synergy of the proton intercalation, substitutional P doping, and the associated OVs in the improvement of N2 activation and hydrogenation in eNRR. The increased eNRR and the suppressed HER led to a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 64.1% and the NH3 yield of 24.5 μg·mg cat–1 h–1 at −0.15 V versus RHE in H2SO4 (pH = 2) as the electrolyte. The specific NH3 yield is more than 20 times higher than that of C-WO3 (1.1 μg·mg cat–1 h–1 with a FE of 20%). The results exceed most of the reported eNRR performances for TMO-based catalysts. Thus, the synergistic proton intercalation and P doping could lead to newer designs and applications of TMO-based catalysts for improved eNRR while suppressing the competing HER.

Shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and slow kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) are considered as the major roadblocks for achieving high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). The solution lies in optimizing the binding strength of LiPSs and catalyzing the SRR. In this work, with the aid of density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, and machine learning (ML), we show that a heterostructure made out of graphene (Gra) and transition metal (TM) atom-anchored graphdiyne (GDY) effectively addresses both these issues. Our results show that the large triangular pores of GDY allow easy penetration of Li+ ions into the sulfur-intercalated TM-GDY/Gra heterostructures and result in LiPSs. The sparsely distributed TM atoms on the GDY surface tune the binding strength of LiPSs and act as catalysts for SRR. Based on the binding strength of LiPSs, TM atom catalysts are categorized into strong, moderate, and weak. Gibbs's free-energy calculations reveal that heterostructures with moderate binding strength are best suited for SRR catalytic activity with barriers smaller than ∼0.4 eV. Furthermore, a Li2S decomposition barrier for the charging process is 3 times lower in the moderate class compared to pristine Gra. Feature importance analysis based on a gradient boosting regression ML model shows that the binding strength of LiPSs in the heterostructures is closely related to intrinsic electronic properties of TM and sulfur atoms, i.e., valence electronic configuration of the TM atom, electronegativity ratio of S to TM atom, and ionic radii of TM and S atoms. Furthermore, it also reveals that the energy barriers for the elementary steps of the SRR are related to the difference in the binding strength of LiPSs corresponding to the conversion step. This study elucidates the suitability of moderate binding heterostructures for LSBs; Fe, Co, Mn, and Rh are preferred single-atom catalysts to serve the purpose.

The formation of dual-atom catalysts or heteroatom ligand modulation is the most promising strategy for optimizing single–atom catalysts (SACs) for the more efficient conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals. However, heteroatom ligands introduced into the dual-atomic sites are expected but still under-explored. In this study, a dual-atom Fe–Ni pair electrocatalyst with N– and S–coordination in porous carbon nanosheets was conceptually predicted for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO (CO2RR). In contrast to SACs and traditional diatomic catalysts (DACs), joined S–coordination can balance the cooperative activities of Fe and Ni sites, making the CO2 adsorption configuration bidentate at both Fe–Ni sites. This regulation leads to a substantial change in CO* adsorption from Fe to Ni sites, facilitating CO desorption and boosting the electrocatalytic CO2RR. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained FeNi–NSC catalyst achieves high selectivity with the Faradaic efficiencies for CO of 96.1%, and a remarkable activity with the turnover frequency of 6526.9 h–1 at −1.0 V, which were over 4.5 and 2.5 times of those from the single Fe or Ni sites. This work gives us insight into designing highly effective catalysts guided by theoretical calculation.

The heme enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYPs) catalyze oxidation reactions with a high level of selectivity. Here, the CYP199A4 enzyme from the bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris HaA2 is used to catalyze the hydroxylation of carbonyl-containing compounds to generate α-hydroxyketones. Both 4-propionyl- and 4-(2-oxopropyl)-benzoic acids were regioselectively hydroxylated by this enzyme to generate α-hydroxyketone metabolites, 4-(2-hydroxypropanoyl)benzoic acid and 4-(1-hydroxy-2-oxopropyl)benzoic acid, respectively, with high stereoselectivity. Co-crystallization of CYP199A4 with each substrate allowed high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme bound with both to be determined. These provide a rationale for biochemical observations related to substrate binding and activity. As these versatile enzymes have a demonstrated ability to support carbon–carbon (C–C) bond cleavage (lyase) reactions on α-hydroxyketones, we assessed if this activity would be catalyzed by wild-type (WT) CYP199A4. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predicted the regioselective hydroxylation of each substrate but indicated that the WT enzyme would not be a good catalyst for lyase activity, in agreement with the experimental observations. The MD simulations also suggested the F182L mutant of CYP199A4 would permit closer approach of the substrate to the ferric-peroxo intermediate, enabling the formation of the lyase transition state. Indeed, this variant was observed to catalyze the cleavage reaction. Furthermore, the F182A variant of CYP199A4 was used to catalyze both the hydroxylation and C–C bond cleavage reactions with both 4-propionyl- and 4-(2-oxopropyl)-benzoic acids using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. This dual CYP activity is analogous to that supported by the mammalian CYP17A1 enzyme in steroid biosynthesis.

Three-component reductive dicarbofunctionalization reactions of 1,3-enynes have been rarely reported because of the intricate control of chemo- and regioselectivity required, coupled with a limited understanding of radical and catalytic species involved. Herein, we report a nickel-catalyzed reductive 1,4-alkylarylation method for 1,3-enynes to yield tri- and tetrasubstituted allenes using readily accessible alkyl and aryl iodides, featuring a simple operational protocol and mild reaction conditions. In our mechanistic studies, the formation of a propargyl/allenyl radical was substantiated by the isolation of a propargyl dimer, the detection of the corresponding TEMPO–radical adduct, and radical probe experiments. Two reduced L2NiAr complexes, expected to act as catalytic intermediates, were generated and characterized by EPR spectroscopy as NiI complexes. The stoichiometric reaction of L2Ni(p-NCC6H4) with 1,3-enyne and alkyl iodide showed conversion into the corresponding propargyl dimer and allene, suggesting that the reaction encompasses the same key mechanistic steps as the catalytic reaction, i.e., activation of alkyl iodide, generation of a propargyl/allenyl radical, and selective coupling of this radical with the aryl component.

Hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) is crucial for selective photocatalytic water splitting. We report a class of metal chalcogenide catalysts (CdxZn1–xS(OH)-SH) that feature mercapto groups (acid sites) and lattice oxygens/hydroxyls (base sites) to form acid–base pairs. Based on this structural design, we demonstrate lattice oxygen/hydroxyl activation and an HAT process under light irradiation and identify a rapid hydrogen-transfer pathway governed by the Grotthuss mechanism. The photocatalyst Cd0.5Zn0.5S(OH)-SH exhibited a rate of 205.8 mmol·g–1·h–1 under full-spectrum illumination and an apparent quantum efficiency of 12.4% at 420 nm without any cocatalyst. Based on the HAT process, this novel catalyst achieves a proton–deuteron separation factor of approximately 11. The energy consumption is projected to be orders of magnitude lower than that of existing technologies. The fabricated large-scale nanocomposites of these photocatalysts are expected to enable large-scale separation of substantial volumes of diluted tritium wastewater.

The interface between a solid catalyst and the reacting medium plays a crucial role in the function of the material in catalysis. In the present work, we show that the surface termination of isostructural molybdenum–vanadium oxides is strongly linked to the real structure of the bulk. This conclusion is based on comparing (scanning) transmission electron microscopy images with pair distribution function (PDF) data obtained for (Mo,V)Ox and (Mo,V,Te,Nb)Ox. Distance-dependent analyses of the PDF results demonstrate that (Mo,V,Te,Nb)Ox exhibits stronger deviations from the averaged orthorhombic crystal structure than (Mo,V)Ox in the short and intermediate regimes. These deviations are explained by higher structural diversity, which is facilitated by the increased chemical complexity of the quinary oxide and in particular by the presence of Nb. This structural diversity is seemingly important to form intrinsic bulk-like surface terminations that are highly selective in alkane oxidation. More rigid (Mo,V)Ox is characterized by defective surfaces that are more active but less selective for the same reactions. In line with machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) calculations, we highlight that the surface termination of (Mo,V,Te,Nb)Ox is characterized by a reconfiguration of the pentagonal building blocks, causing a preferential exposure of Nb sites. The presented results foster hypotheses that chemical complexity is superior for the performance of multifunctional catalysts. The underlying principle is not the presence of multiple chemically different surface centers but instead the ability of structural diversity to optimally align and distribute the elements at the surface and, thus, to shape the structural environment around the active sites. This study experimentally evidences the origin of the structure-directing impact of the real structure of the bulk on functional interfaces and encourages the development of efficient surface engineering strategies toward improved high-performance selective oxidation catalysts.

The Cu/zinc oxide (ZnO)/Al2O3 catalyst is highly favored in the hydrogenation of dimethyl maleate (HDMM) to coproduction of 1,4-butanediol (BDO), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), and tetrahydrofuran, and an in-depth study on its catalytic principle has a long-standing interest in the current study. Herein, by combining density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we revealed the dominant pathways and reaction network of the HDMM process on the ZnO/Cu(111) surface. The effect of Cu–ZnO synergy is reflected in promoting the anchoring of ester carbonyls and decreasing the difficulty of hydroxyl group formation, which was clarified by mechanisms, density of states, and Bader charge analyses. From the perspective of constructive modification of active sites, a strategy was proposed to improve the GBL formation rate by decreasing the barrier of methanol removal based on the concepts of degree of rate control, and the BDO selectivity could be improved by increasing the barrier of the out-of-ring C–O bond cleavage in GBL hydrogenation. From the perspective of the external environment, the optimal reaction conditions of different target products were determined by manipulating the temperature and pressure. This study provides a guide for modifying active sites in Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and potential possibilities for studying the complex reaction systems involving C4+ substances by multiscale simulation.

Metallaphotoredox catalysis can unlock useful pathways for transforming organic reactants into desirable products, largely due to the conversion of photon energy into chemical potential to drive redox and bond transformation processes. Despite the importance of these processes for cross-coupling reactions and other transformations, their mechanistic details are only superficially understood. In this review, we have provided a detailed summary of various photoredox mechanisms that have been proposed to date for Ni–bipyridine (bpy) complexes, focusing separately on photosensitized and direct excitation reaction processes. By highlighting multiple bond transformation pathways and key findings, we depict how photoredox reaction mechanisms, which ultimately define substrate scope, are themselves defined by the ground- and excited-state geometric and electronic structures of key Ni-based intermediates. We further identify knowledge gaps to motivate future mechanistic studies and the development of synergistic research approaches spanning the physical, organic, and inorganic chemistry communities.
