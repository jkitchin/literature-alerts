Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis has emerged as a highly promising technology for sustainable hydrogen (H2) production, but its widespread application relies heavily on the development of high-performance and cost-effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Currently, noble-metal-based materials (such as Pt and Ir/Ru oxides) serve as benchmark electrocatalysts for HER and OER in acidic environments, but their high cost and limited availability pose major challenges toward industrialization. Low-cost noble-metal-free metal oxides are an important class of functional materials with rich compositions and structures, offering flexible electronic and crystal structures with tunable physical and chemical properties. In this Review, we present a comprehensive and timely summary of the remarkable progress achieved in the field of noble-metal-free metal oxides for catalyzing acidic HER and OER. First, we provide a brief description of the fundamental concepts of HER and OER in acidic media, including mechanisms, computational activity descriptors, and experimental parameters that are utilized for the evaluation of catalytic performance. Second, an overview is provided covering various types of noble-metal-free metal oxides for HER and OER in acidic media reported so far (e.g., simple transition metal oxides, spinel oxides, rutile antimonate oxides, perovskite oxides, specially structured metal oxides, and mixed-metal-oxide composites), with a focus on the designed strategies for enhancing performance and establishing correlations between properties and activity. Lastly, the challenges and future research directions regarding acidic HER and OER are summarized and discussed.

Abstract Guided by the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the development of efficient, stable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions is of paramount importance. A unique; tremella-like LaNiO 3 -NiO composite has been fabricated through a simple and robust procedure. This material stands out as an effective catalyst in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), showcasing its potential to enhance the efficiency of electrochemical energy transformations. This composite exhibits a remarkably low overpotential of only 383 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , coupled with a Tafel slope of 76.66 mV dec -1 . Furthermore, it boasts the capability to sustain continuous operation for more than 30 h at a current density of 20 mA cm -2 . The unique morphology of the catalyst expands the electrochemically active surface area, providing more available active sites to improve catalytic performance. This discovery presents a promising opportunity for the development of non-precious metal electrocatalysts for OER.

Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising strategy to solve and mitigate the coming energy shortage and global environmental pollution. Searching for efficient electrocatalysts for HER remains challenging through traditional trial‐and‐error methods from numerous potential material candidates. Theoretical high throughput calculation assisted by machine learning is a possible method to screen excellent HER electrocatalysts effectively. This will pave the way for high‐efficiency and low‐price electrocatalyst findings. In this review, we comprehensively introduce the machine learning workflow and standard models for hydrogen reduction reactions. This mainly illustrates how machine learning is used in catalyst filtration and descriptor exploration. Subsequently, several applications, including surface electrocatalysts, two‐dimensional (2D) electrocatalysts, and single/dual atom electrocatalysts using machine learning in electrocatalytic HER, are highlighted and introduced. Finally, the corresponding challenge and perspective for machine learning in electrocatalytic hydrogen reduction reactions are concluded. We hope this critical review can provide a comprehensive understanding of machine learning for HER catalyst design and guide the future theoretical and experimental investigation of HER catalyst findings.

Abstract Single‐atom alloys (SAAs) have gained increasing prominence in the field of selective hydrogenation reactions due to their uniform distribution of active sites and the unique host‐guest metal interactions. Herein, 15 SAAs are constructed to comprehensively elucidate the relationship between host‐guest metal interaction and catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of 4‐nitrostyrene (4‐NS) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results demonstrate that the SAAs with strong host‐guest metal interactions exhibit a preference for N─O bond cleavage, and the reaction energy barrier of the hydrogenation process is primarily influenced by the host metal. Among them, Ir 1 Ni SAA stands out as the prime catalyst candidate, showcasing exceptional activity and selectivity. Furthermore, the Ir 1 Ni SAA is subsequently prepared through precise synthesis techniques and evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of 4‐NS to 4‐aminostyrene (4‐AS). As anticipated, the Ir 1 Ni SAA demonstrates extraordinary catalytic performance (yield > 96%). In situ FT‐IR experiments and DFT calculations further confirmed that the unique host‐guest metal interaction at the Ir‐Ni interface site of Ir 1 Ni SAA endows it with excellent 4‐NS selective hydrogenation ability. This work provides valuable insights into enhancing the performance of SAAs catalysts in selective hydrogenation reactions by modulating the host‐guest metal interactions.

The rate-determining oxygen evolution reaction (OER) always limits the high-efficient conversion of solar energy to green hydrogen fuels through photoelectrocatalytic or photocatalytic water splitting. The high catalytic overpotential and the instability of catalytic center are commonly regarded as the primary factors contributing to the low rate of OER, remaining to be a challenge in the field of water splitting. Herein, a polymetallic oxide cocatalyst (Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx) with well-defined electronic and catalytic properties is designed on BiVO4 photoelectrode for highly efficient and stable photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. The experimental characterization demonstrates that the dual-layer design of Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx can significantly optimizes the electronic property of MnOy and FeCoNiOx components, boosting the photogenerated charge transfer between Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx cocatalyst and BiVO4 photoelectrode. The density functional theory (DFT) simulation reveals that the Mo sites in Mo-MnOy layer can activate the neighboring surface Mn sites instead of directly serving as the catalytic center, thereby establishing these Mn sites as primary active centers for achieving stable OER. The developed Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx/BiVO4 photoelectrode exhibits a current density of 6.18 mA cm−2 with an excellent stability for 30 h at 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun irradiation, exhibiting the excellent activity and durability. This work sheds light on design of high-performance multiple-component water-oxidation cocatalyst on photoanode.

Epoxy resin thermosets (ERTs) are an important class of polymeric materials. However, owing to their highly cross-linked nature, they suffer from poor recyclability, which contributes to an unacceptable level of environmental pollution. There is a clear need for the design of inherently recyclable ERTs that are based on renewable resources. We present the synthesis and closed-loop recycling of a fully lignocellulose-derivable epoxy resin (DGF/MBCA), prepared from dimethyl ester of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (DMFD), 4,4′-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (MBCA), and glycidol, which displays excellent thermomechanical properties (a glass transition temperature of 170°C, and a storage modulus at 25°C of 1.2 gigapascals). Notably, the material undergoes methanolysis in the absence of any catalyst, regenerating 90% of the original DMFD. The diamine MBCA and glycidol can subsequently be reformed by acetolysis. Application and recycling of DGF/MBCA in glass and plant fiber composites are demonstrated.

A promising high-strength Fe – 17.7Mn – 4.7Cr – 0.48C – 10Ni – 5Al – 4Cu wt.% Austenitic steel was solutionized, then aged for 3 or 10 h at 580°C producing a pronounced precipitation hardening response primarily due to the formation nanoscale NiAl precipitates. Density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics (MD), and discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) calculations were combined with microstructural data from atom-probe tomography (APT), informing theoretical strengthening models to predict yield strength at different stages of precipitation as a function of NiAl size, volume fraction, and composition. These yield strength predictions were compared with experimental microhardness measurements of the various ageing conditions, including the peak microhardness of 490 HV, which corresponds to an estimated alloy yield strength of 1200 MPa. Comparing MD calculations with theoretical models showed that anti-phase boundary (APB) formation was the predominant barrier to dislocation motion posed by the NiAl precipitates. Using single dislocation particle strengthening models with NiAl APB energies calculated from DFT, good agreement was observed between DDD calculations and the 10 h peak-aged experimental measurements, while agreement with the 3 h experimental measurements required reducing the NiAl APB energy. These results demonstrate the utility of the undertaken approach integrating simulations and experiments across multiple length-scales, particularly the presented coarse-grained DDD simulation method towards modeling materials strengthened by very fine precipitates. The results further suggest that the observed NiAl precipitates may adopt an alternate crystal structure early in their formation.

Bisphenol compounds [bisphenol A (BPA), etc.] are one class of the most important and widespread pollutants in food and environment, which pose severe endocrine disrupting effect, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, and metabolic toxicity on humans and animals. Simultaneous rapid determination of BPA and its analogues (bisphenol S, bisphenol AF, etc.) with extraordinary potential resolution and sensitivity is of great significance but still extremely challenging. Herein, a series of single-atom catalysts (SACs) were synthesized by anchoring different metal atoms (Mg, Co, Ni, and Cu) on N-doped carbon materials and used as sensing materials for simultaneous detection of bisphenols with similar chemical structures. The Mg-based SAC enables the potential discrimination and simultaneous rapid detection of multiple bisphenols, showing outstanding analytical performances, outperforming all other SACs and traditional electrode materials. Our experiments and density functional theory calculations show that pyrrolic N serves as the adsorption site for the adsorption of bisphenols and the Mg atom serves as the active site for the electrocatalytic oxidation of bisphenols, which play a synergistic role as dual active centers in improving the sensing performance. The results of this work may pave the way for the rational design of SACs as advanced sensing and catalytic materials.

A strategic approach has been proposed for designing robust, high-performing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts tailored for saline water splitting. By employing a density functional theory (DFT)-based computational screening process, a set of promising dopants were identified from a range of 26 3d to 5d transition metals, with the aim of enhancing the activity and saline water resilience of the catalysts. The screening methodology was 3-fold, encompassing evaluations of OER energetics, chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) energetics, and chloride-corrosion energetics. The screening led to the selection of Sc as a promising dopant, which substantially elevated the performance of the NiFeOOH catalysts. This improvement was validated by an 87 mV decrease in OER overpotential at 100 mA/cm2 and a 100 h stability test under 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl conditions. This study contributes to the understanding of the alkaline ClER and chloride-corrosion mechanisms, providing insights into catalyst behavior under saline conditions.

Abstract Driven by the goal of establishing a fossil‐fuel‐free and nuclear‐power‐free economy based on renewable energy, metal‐air batteries are regarded as promising energy conversion and storage devices. Developing efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalysts for the air electrode of metal‐air batteries is becoming increasingly important. In this work, 36 transition metal (TM) single‐atom catalysts are designed based on MXenes Ti 2 CT 2 with different surface terminal atoms (T = O, S, Cl), and their ORR/OER catalytic activity and stability are evaluated by the density functional theory. Ni@Ti 2 CO 2 , Pd@Ti 2 CS 2 , and Co@Ti 2 CCl 2 are found to exhibit good catalytic activity with ORR/OER overpotentials of .54 V/.62 V, .59 V/.29 V, .44 V/.40 V. The aggregation behavior of three catalysts is estimated by comparing the average binding energy of one, two, three, and four TM atoms anchored on Ti 2 CT 2 . This work cannot only provide a theoretical guide to develop bifunctional single‐atom catalysts, but also help us understand the effect of terminal atoms on the electronic structures and catalytic activity of TM@Ti 2 CT 2 .

This study undertakes a thorough computational exploration of Ziegler–Natta catalysis, emphasizing the role of external donors, particularly dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane (D donor), in the production of polypropylene. Employing the PreFerred Potential (PFP) model within the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method and Universal Neural Network Potentials (UNNP), we meticulously assessed the structural integrity of MgCl2 crystals, the dynamics of TiCl4 adsorption, and the kinetics of propylene insertion reactions. Our results demonstrated the precision of the PFP model in accurately replicating the crystalline structures and reaction mechanisms inherent in Ziegler–Natta catalyst systems. A pivotal finding from our research is the significant reduction in activation energy for isotactic propylene insertion, attributed to the presence of at least two D donors around a single Ti active site. Additionally, our computational approach, characterized by its speed and efficiency, successfully incorporates realistic catalyst models, encompassing a range of donor compounds, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental practices. Our study not only corroborated the existing computational models but also provided novel insights into the mechanistic roles of external donors in Ziegler–Natta catalysis.

Abstract A robust method for enhancing the dispersion and stabilization of small metal nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalysts is developed. It involves in situ complexation of palladium(II) by histidine, in water, prior to impregnation in fumed silica. TEM images show that the histidine facilitates dispersion of the Pd(II) into finer nanoscale particles (≈2 nm) uniformly distributed on the support, rather than the large clusters (≈5 nm) seen in the absence of histidine. After hydrogen reduction, assessments using CO chemisorption and propylene hydrogenation indicate that the coordinated histidine might obscure the active sites on the Pd particles. However, as histidine decomposes between 220 and 300 °C in air, these materials are treated at 225 °C in air for 48 h. Afterwards the Pd(II) particles remain the same size, but after hydrogen reduction, there is a 2.4‐fold increase in CO gas adsorption, indicative of an expanded Pd surface area. Furthermore, superior catalyst stability (activity >200 h) is observed during propylene hydrogenation at 250 °C. This is consistent with histidine use having generated widely spaced, uniformly small, Pd nanoparticles on the silica support which is expected to help prevent agglomeration (sintering) during catalysis. This is a convenient low‐cost strategy for reducing metal content, preventing sintering and optimizing catalyst performance.

Pt is a well-known benchmark catalyst in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that drives electrochemical O2-to-H2O conversion with maximum chemical energy-to-electricity efficiency. Once dispersing bulk Pt into isolated single atoms, however, the preferential ORR pathway remains a long-standing controversy due to their complex local coordination environment and diverse site density over substrates. Herein, using a set of carbon nanotube supported Pt–N–C single-atom catalysts, we demonstrate how the neighboring N dopants regulate the electronic structure of the Pt central atom and thus steer the ORR selectivity; that is, the O2-to-H2O2 conversion selectivity can be tailored from 10% to 85% at 0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, via a comprehensive X-ray-radiated spectroscopy and shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy analysis coupled with theoretical modeling, we reveal that a dominant pyridinic- and pyrrolic-N coordination within the first shell of Pt–N–C motifs favors the 4e– ORR, whereas the introduction of a second-shell graphitic-N dopant weakens *OOH binding on neighboring Pt sites and gives rise to a dominant 2e– ORR. These findings underscore the importance of the chemical environment effect for steering the electrochemical performance of single-atom catalysts.

Ion mobility in electrolytes and electrodes is a critical factor influencing the performance of batteries. Low ion mobility is, for example, one of the major factors reducing the range of battery-electric vehicles in winter. On the other hand, with respect to the ion mobility in battery cathode materials, there are scaling relations linking large insertion energies and thus high voltages with high migration barriers corresponding to low ion mobility. Consequently, a compromise has to be made between these two conflicting properties. In this opinion, we will address how computational screening and the identification of descriptors can accelerate the search for solid battery materials with improved ion migration properties, but we will also discuss how the scaling relations linking reaction and activation energies might be overcome.

Abstract Above‐band gap optical excitation of non‐centrosymmetric semiconductors can lead to the spatial shift of the center of electron charge in a process known as shift current. Shift current is investigated in single‐crystal SnS 2 , a layered semiconductor with the band gap of ≈2.3 eV, by THz emission spectroscopy and first principles density functional theory (DFT). It is observed that normal incidence excitation with above gap (400 nm; 3.1 eV) pulses results in THz emission from 2H SnS 2 () polytype, where such emission is nominally forbidden by symmetry. It is argued that the underlying symmetry breaking arises due to the presence of stacking faults that are known to be ubiquitous in SnS 2 single crystals and construct a possible structural model of a stacking fault with symmetry properties consistent with the experimental observations. In addition to shift current, it is observed THz emission by optical rectification excited by below band gap (800 nm; 1.55 eV) pulses but it requires excitation fluence more than two orders of magnitude higher to produce same signal amplitude. These results suggest that ultrafast shift current in which can be excited with visible light in blue–green portion of the spectrum makes SnS 2 a promising source material for THz photonics.

The potential of maximum entropy (PME) is an indicator of extreme disorder at the electrode/electrolyte interface and can predict changes in catalytic activity within electrolytes of varying compositions. The laser‐induced current transient technique is employed to evaluate the PME for Au polycrystalline (Au pc ) electrodes immersed in Ar‐saturated cation electrolyte mixtures containing potassium and sodium ions at pH = 8. Five cation ratios (0.5 M K 2 SO 4 :0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 = 0:1, 0.25:0.75, 0.5:0.5, 0.75:0.25, and 1:0) are explored, considering earlier studies that unveil cation‐dependent shifts at near‐neutral pH. Moreover, for all electrolyte compositions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is utilized to determine the double‐layer capacitance ( C DL ), the minimum of which should be close to the potential of zero charge (PZC). By correlating cation molar ratios with the PMEs and PZCs, the impact on the model oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, assessed via the rotating disk electrode method, is analyzed. The results demonstrate a linear relationship between electrolyte cation mixtures and PME, while ORR activity exhibits an exponential trend. This observation validates the PME–activity link hypothesis, underscoring electrolyte components’ pivotal role in tailoring interfacial properties for electrocatalytic systems. These findings introduce a new degree of freedom for designing optimal electrocatalytic systems by adjusting various electrolyte components.

Highly active transition metal nitrides are desirable for electrocatalytic reactions, but their long-term stability is still unsatisfactory and thus limiting commercial applications. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique and universal room-temperature urea plasma method for controllable synthesis of N-doped carbon coated metal (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) nitrides arrays electrocatalysts. The preformed metal oxides arrays can be successfully converted into metal nitrides arrays with preserved nanostructures and a thin layer of N-doped carbon (N-C) via one-step urea plasma. Typically, as a representative case, N-C@CoN nanowire arrays are illustrated and corresponding formation mechanism by plasma is proposed. Notably, the designed N-C@CoN catalysts deliver excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability both in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). For OER, a low overpotential (264 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and high stability (>50 h at 20 mA/cm2) are acquired. For UOR, a current density of 100 mA/cm2 is achieved at only 1.39 V and maintain over 100 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that the synergetic coupling effect of CoN and N-C can significantly facilitate the charge-transfer process, optimize adsorbed intermediates binding strength and further greatly decrease the energy barrier. This strategy provides a novel method for fabrication of N-C@ metal nitrides as highly active and stable catalysts.

Two-dimensional transition metal (TM)-doped dichalcogenides (TMDs) are among the most promising materials for water-splitting catalysts. Among various methods applied to promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in TMDs, doping with TM heteroatoms has attracted attention because this strategy allows optimization of hydrogen adsorption and H2 generation reactions. Herein, we conduct in-depth, systematic analyses of the trends in the change in the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*)—the most well-known descriptor for evaluating HER performance—for doped TMDs. The total of 150 different doped TMDs are used to conduct an atomic-level analysis of the origin of ΔGH* changes upon TM heteroatom doping. Moreover, we suggest two key factors that govern hydrogen adsorption over doped TMDs: 1) changes in the charge of chalcogen atoms, where hydrogen atoms are adsorbed onto early-TM-doped structures and 2) structural deformation energies accompanying the introduced dopants of the late-TM-doped structures. Furthermore, we propose a new perspective on how vacancies in TM-doped TMDs can result in the enhanced ΔGH* for the HER. We suggest that introducing electrostatic and structural controls in early- and late-TM-doped systems, respectively, are effective strategies for achieving thermoneutral ΔGH* in TMDs and promote the design of new TMD catalysts with superior water-splitting capabilities.

Solid form selection and design of crystalline small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) would benefit from computational prediction and rationalization of the mechanical properties. Before such practical applications can be considered, the robustness and reproducibility of the computed properties with respect to the chosen level of theory must be understood. In this work, elastic constants of eight molecular crystals, with an emphasis on APIs, have been calculated using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT). The different DFT methods considered do not, in general, consistently predict the absolute magnitudes of the elastic moduli, which disagree by over 50% for some crystals. Relative properties such as elastic anisotropy are more robust, mostly consistent between models, and in qualitative agreement with experiment. Calculated anisotropies could also be rationalized in terms of the structural features of the crystal. Overall, this work reveals that DFT-computed elastic properties may not offer a ground truth in absolute terms. Future applications of DFT in the context of high-throughput material screening or training of machine learning models will therefore require judicious selection of target properties and evaluation metrics. Only after methodological limitations are properly identified can more in-depth investigations be undertaken to assess the feasibility of applying DFT in pharmaceutical development.

The incorporation of disparate materials into heterostructures has arisen as a formidable technique for modulating interfaces and electronic configurations. The introduction of two-dimensional (2D) materials has unveiled unparalleled prospects for generating innovative heterostructures in the guise of van der Waals stacks. Tantalum sulfide (TaS2), a prominent 2D material, has been extensively studied across various domains, faces constraints in thermoelectric conversion attributed to its diminished absolute Seebeck coefficient below 10 μV K−1. By constructing a two-dimensional van der Waals stack heterostructure, TaS2/organics/TiS2, a significantly enhanced absolute Seebeck coefficient of 38.3 μV K−1 was obtained, mostly attributed to the induced interfacial effect. The power factor reached 87.6 μW m−1 K−2, marking a sevenfold increase compared to the original. The thermoelectric generator demonstrated a maximum power of 86.4 nW at a temperature difference of 40 K. Employing such heterostructure films in tactile and respiration sensors demonstrated encouraging prospects for aiding the visually impaired with language assistance and facilitating real-time monitoring of respiratory rates for health monitoring purposes. This study highlights the expansive potential of two-dimensional van der Waals stack heterostructure technology for use in flexible thermoelectric generators, wearable sensors, and beyond.

ConspectusDue to its importance for electrolyzers or metal–air batteries for energy conversion or storage, there is huge interest in the development of high-performance materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Theoretical investigations have aided the search for active material motifs through the construction of volcano plots for the kinetically sluggish OER, which involves the transfer of four proton–electron pairs to form a single oxygen molecule. The theory-driven volcano approach has gained unprecedented popularity in the catalysis and energy communities, largely due to its simplicity, as adsorption free energies can be used to approximate the electrocatalytic activity by heuristic descriptors.In the last two decades, the binding-energy-based volcano method has witnessed a renaissance with special concepts being developed to incorporate missing factors into the analysis. To this end, this Account summarizes and discusses the different generations of volcano plots for the example of the OER. While first-generation methods relied on the assessment of the thermodynamic information for the OER reaction intermediates by means of scaling relations, the second and third generations developed strategies to include overpotential and kinetic effects into the analysis of activity trends. Finally, the fourth generation of volcano approaches allowed the incorporation of various mechanistic pathways into the volcano methodology, thus paving the path toward data- and mechanistic-driven volcano plots in electrocatalysis.Although the concept of volcano plots has been significantly expanded in recent years, further research activities are discussed by challenging one of the main paradigms of the volcano concept. To date, the evaluation of activity trends relies on the assumption of proton-coupled electron transfer steps (CPET), even though there is experimental evidence of sequential proton–electron transfer (SPET) steps. While the computational assessment of SPET for solid-state electrodes is ambitious, it is strongly suggested to comprehend their importance in energy conversion and storage processes, including the OER. This can be achieved by knowledge transfer from homogeneous to heterogeneous electrocatalysis and by focusing on the material class of single-atom catalysts in which the active center is well defined. The derived concept of how to analyze the importance of SPET for mechanistic pathways in the OER over solid-state electrodes could further shape our understanding of the proton–electron transfer steps at electrified solid/liquid interfaces, which is crucial for further progress toward sustainable energy and climate neutrality.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed along two distinct pathways: the 4-electron pathway and the 2-electron pathway. The 4-electron pathway holds significant value in fuel cell technology, whereas the 2-electron pathway plays a crucial role in the industrial production of H2O2. Accurate prediction of the catalytic selectivity in the ORR stands as a pivotal factor in designing effective catalyst materials. It has been experimentally demonstrated that Au–Pd nanoalloy exhibit a high selectivity toward electrocatalytic H2O2 production. However, based on the widely employed computational hydrogen electrode method, the production of H2O on the surface of Au–Pd nanoalloy is more thermodynamically favorable, which shows a discrepancy with experimental results. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of aqueous environment as well as electrode potential toward the ORR employing state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations. Our work reveals that the water molecules above the Au–Pd nanoalloy surface can alter the adsorption behavior of O2 and weaken the interaction between metal atom in the catalyst and oxygen atom in O2, therefore contributing to a high selectivity of Au–Pd nanoalloy toward H2O2 production. With a more negative electrode potential, the stability of H2O2 will decrease, and the corresponding selectivity will be lowered. These discoveries provide a dynamic perspective elucidating efficient H2O2 production on Au–Pd nanoalloy surfaces. Furthermore, they underscore the paramount significance of both the aqueous environment and electrode potential in shaping the ORR process.

This study delves into understanding the relationship between synthesis conditions and the resulting properties of the Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF) UiO-66, with an emphasis on machine learning (ML) in making quantitative predictions. Utilizing a comprehensive, manually curated data set, three ML models are trained to predict UiO-66 properties, including specific surface area, defect concentration, and particle size, based on synthesis parameters. A solution to the inverse problem, which involves finding optimal synthesis conditions for given properties using the method of differential evolution, has been implemented in the software. Experimental validation of models through synthesis and detailed characterization of UiO-66 samples and comparison with the predicted properties show a high accuracy, confirming their reliability. Interpretation of the ML models using Shapley additive explanation values and two-dimensional (2D) partial dependence plots reveals both previously known patterns, validating the adequacy of the models, and new, previously unexplored patterns in the relationships between the synthesis conditions and UiO-66 properties. The developed models can be used as a basis for further research on MOF synthesis. This approach can be applied to the rational design of UiO-66 for various applications.

Abstract Seawater electrolysis (SWE) is proposed to be a promising approach to green hydrogen (H 2 ) production but its large‐scale deployment faces challenges because of the anodic competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and high energy consumption. To address these challenges, innovative hybrid SWE systems have recently emerged, able to mitigate the interference of CER and substantially reduce the electrical energy needed. Herein, the preparation of 2D layered PtTe nanosheets (e‐PtTe NSs) using the liquid‐phase exfoliation method is reported, which show outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution (HER), hydrazine oxidation (HzOR), and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in seawater. Using e‐PtTe NSs as trifunctional catalysts, two hybrid SWE systems are demonstrated: 1) a hydrazine‐assisted acid‐alkaline dual‐electrolyte seawater electrolyzer enabled by a bipolar membrane (BPM‐OHzSWE), which can simultaneously produce H 2 and generate electricity through harvesting the electrochemical neutralization energy and leveraging the advantage of the HzOR over the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in terms of anodic potentials; 2) a hydrazine‐assisted SWE system powered by a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC), which can realize self‐powered H 2 production. These novel hybrid SWE systems show substantial promise for energy‐saving and cost‐effective production of H 2 from seawater.

δ-MnO2 catalysts have attracted much attention because of the abundance of oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface to achieve efficient catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde (HCHO). However, the recycling and regeneration of powdered δ-MnO2 nano-catalysts still limits the practical application of the catalysts. Here, the surface of aramid fiber (MPIA) was treated by corona activation to introduce reactive groups, such as -OH, and -COOH. These reactive groups can promote the exposure of more Mn3+ on the surface of loaded δ-MnO2 to produce OVs. Meanwhile, the strong interactions between the activated MPAI and δ-MnO2 was formed, which helped to improve the stability and cyclic regeneration of the fiber-based δ-MnO2 catalysts. The effects of Mn3+ and OVs on the catalytic performance of δ-MnO2 were targeted and characterized by SEM, XPS and BET. The pathways of HCHO removal by OVs on the δ-MnO2 surface and the relative free energies of the corresponding intermediates were also explored. The results revealed that optimizing the morphology of MPIA surface-loaded δ-MnO2 can obtain a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, with excellent HCHO removal efficiency at room temperature and high catalytic activity even after multiple cycle regeneration.

Theoretical calculations at the revPBE0-D3(PCM)/def2-TZVP level were performed to investigate the mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the FeN4-doped NCMs (graphene, single-walled (6,6)-armchair and (12,0)-zigzag carbon nanotubes) as catalysts. The effect of the support and relative orientation of FeN4 fragment in the catalyst structure on the ORR activity and stability of the differently adsorbed successive intermediates (O2*, HO2*, O*, HO*, H2O2*, H2O*) is discussed. Special attention is given to the possible poisoning effect of CO. The relative catalytic activity of the metal center and the adjacent C2 site of the carbon support are analyzed depending on the structure of the support. The metal catalytic center on the armchair nanotube and graphene supports is prone to deactivation by poisoning with CO, whereas in the zigzag nanotube supported catalyst the metal center is tolerant to CO. The four-electron mechanism of ORR is shown to be preferable over the two-electron mechanism in both acidic and alkaline media, both on the metal and C2 centers.

Developing an affordable and efficient electrocatalyst for bifunctional activity is crucial for the advancement of water electrolysis technology. Doping with foreign atoms in electrocatalysts can tune the electronic properties, which further improves the water-splitting process. Herein, we have developed Ce-doped Ni0.85Se as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. The hydrothermal method was used to develop a two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet of the Ce-doped Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst. The as-developed pristine and doped electrocatalysts were characterized through various techniques. The optimized Ce0.1Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst represents −0.238 and 1.56 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode as an onset potential for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, to generate 20 and 50 mA/cm2 current density. The Ce0.1Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst works as a suitable cell in an alkaline medium with 1.73 V to generate 10 mA/cm2 and 24 h stability. The introduction of Ce doping plays a pivotal role in tuning the electronic environment and facilitating a synergistic effect, ultimately improving the overall efficiency. Moreover, the active sites for water splitting were generated by expansion and distortion in the Ni0.85Se lattice. The enhanced specific surface area and porous 2D nanosheets of the doped sample are beneficial for water splitting. The theoretical results also prove that after doping with Ce, the catalyst has zero band gap, optimum Gibbs hydrogen adsorption energy, and an electronic state are the reasons for improved electrocatalytic performance. The actual active sites in the Ce-doped Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst were determined with density functional theory calculations. Therefore, this idea can generate a route for developing a doped electrocatalyst with efficient and stable activity.

Molecular crystals are difficult to model with accurate first-principles methods due to large unit cells. On the other hand, accurate modeling is required as polymorphs often differ by only 1 kJ/mol. Machine learning interatomic potentials promise to provide accuracy of the baseline first-principles methods with a cost lower by orders of magnitude. Using the existing databases of the density functional theory calculations for molecular crystals and molecules, we train global machine learning interatomic potentials, usable for any molecular crystal. We test the performance of the potentials on experimental benchmarks and show that they perform better than classical force fields and, in some cases, are comparable to the density functional theory calculations.

The ability to find optimal molecular structures with desired properties is a popular challenge, with applications in areas such as drug discovery. Genetic algorithms are a common approach to global minima molecular searches due to their ability to search large regions of the energy landscape and decrease computational time via parallelization. In order to decrease the amount of unstable intermediate structures being produced and increase the overall efficiency of an evolutionary algorithm, clustering was introduced in multiple instances. However, there is little literature detailing the effects of differentiating the selection frequencies between clusters. In order to find a balance between exploration and exploitation in our genetic algorithm, we propose a system of clustering the starting population and choosing clusters for an evolutionary algorithm run via a dynamic probability that is dependent on the fitness of molecules generated by each cluster. We define four parameters, MFavOvrAll-A, MFavClus-B, NoNewFavClus-C, and Select-D, that correspond to a reward for producing the best structure overall, a reward for producing the best structure in its own cluster, a penalty for not producing the best structure, and a penalty based on the selection ratio of the cluster, respectively. A reward increases the probability of a cluster's future selection, while a penalty decreases it. In order to optimize these four parameters, we used a Gaussian distribution to approximate the evolutionary algorithm performance of each cluster and performed a grid search for different parameter combinations. Results show parameter MFavOvrAll-A (rewarding clusters for producing the best structure overall) and parameter Select-D (appearance penalty) have a significantly larger effect than parameters MFavClus-B and NoNewFavClus-C. In order to produce the most successful models, a balance between MFavOvrAll-A and Select-D must be made that reflects the exploitation vs exploration trade-off often seen in reinforcement learning algorithms. Results show that our reinforcement-learning-based method for selecting clusters outperforms an unclustered evolutionary algorithm for quinoline-like structure searches.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a quantum chemical computational method used to predict and analyze the electronic properties of atoms, molecules, and solids based on the density of electrons rather than wavefunctions. It provides insights into the structure, bonding, and behaviour of different molecules, including those involved in the development of chemotherapeutic agents, such as Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). HDACs are a wide group of metalloenzymes that facilitate the removal of acetyl groups from acetyl-lysine residues situated in the N-terminal tail of histones. Abnormal HDAC recruitment has been linked to several human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, it has been recognized as a prospective target for accelerating the development of anticancer therapies. Researchers have studied HDACs and its inhibitors extensively using a combination of experimental methods and diverse in-silico approaches such as machine learning and quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, pharmacophore mapping, and more. In this context, DFT studies can make significant contribution by shedding light on the molecular properties, interactions, reaction pathways, transition states, reactivity and mechanisms involved in the development of HDACis. This review attempted to elucidate the scope in which DFT methodologies may be used to enhance our comprehension of the molecular aspects of HDAC inhibitors, aiding in the rational design and optimization of these compounds for therapeutic applications in cancer and other ailments. The insights gained can guide experimental efforts toward developing more potent and selective HDAC inhibitors.

In this chapter, the acknowledgments that appeared in 2,075 articles published between 2005 and 2019 in the "Top Five" analytic philosophy journals are analyzed with both qualitative and quantitative techniques. After framing the acknowledgments as zones of a sui generis communication between authors and readers, which enable analytic philosophers to place themselves in the social space of analytic philosophy, the first part of the chapter focuses on the stylistics of the acknowledgments. Unwritten norms and conventions that shape the acknowledgments as a literary genre are reconstructed and explained in the light of the theory of acknowledgments as positioning signals (Chap. 2 ). Then, in the second part of the chapter, a quantitative approach is used to measure different social dimensions of the acknowledgees population. In this way, the social space of recent analytic philosophy is charted.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been widely considered as one of the promising candidates to replace platinum-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts due to their attractive properties. However, the single active site in such catalysts poses challenges in surpassing the inherent limits of scaling relations between adsorption energy of multi-intermediates in ORR catalytic process. Herein, inspired by the concept of multiple active centers, we design a series of stable pyrite-like bimetallic diselenides (A0.5B0.5Se2, A = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, B = Cu, Cd, Sn) as catalysts, which aim at enhancing ORR catalytic activity through synergistic effect in dual active sites. Through density functional theory calculations, we find that the ORR activities of most A0.5B0.5Se2 catalysts are comparable to or even better than those of the noble metal Pt, verifying the promotional ORR activities of A0.5B0.5Se2. Among them, Co0.5Sn0.5Se2 has an overpotential of 0.31 V, which shows better catalytic performance than Pt for ORR. Such improvement is attributed to the tandem reaction mechanism and the reduction in the barrier for the rate-determining steps, resulting from the presence of dual active sites within Co0.5Sn0.5Se2. The projected density of states (PDOS) and Bader charge analysis reveal that the excellent catalytic activity is contributed by the strong d-p orbital hybridization between Co and Sn in the Co0.5Sn0.5Se2, which significantly weakens the over-adsorption of the crucial O* intermediates. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights for designing optimum ORR catalysts.

The environmentally benign and long-lived zeolite catalyst is highly desired for Friedel-Crafts (FC) alkylation of benzene with long-chain olefins. Herein, MWW zeolites with different layer arrangements and surface structures are employed as model catalysts to investigate the effects of microscale structure on the catalytic behaviors for the alkylation of benzene with 1-dodecene. It is revealed that two kinds of acid sites located on the external surface and within surface 12-membered ring (12MR) pockets of MWW zeolites are effective for this reaction. Unexpectedly, the turnover frequency (TOF) of the effective acid sites over single-layer MWW (SL-MWW) is significantly lower than that of MCM-22. Kinetic study indicates that apparent activation energy (Ea) is decreased in the order of MCM-36 > MCM-22 > SL-MWW. Combined with DFT calculation, the lowest TOF and Ea over SL-MWW can be reasonably attributed to the higher proportion of acid sites in the 12MR pockets and its higher diffusional limitation for products. Moreover, the highest Ea of MCM-36 and adsorption energy verified the decreased diffusion limitation of 12MR pockets due to the structure defect resulting from the desilication. Finally, the highly efficient and stable MCM-36 catalyst was achieved in the optimal reaction conditions, which is a potential catalyst for industrial application in the field of FC alkylation reactions.

One mixed oxide with 5 cations in equimolar proportions in the sublattice, to fulfil high-entropy oxide (HEO) criteria, has been developed and investigated as oxygen carrier for chemical looping combustion processes. As far as we know, nobody has explored this class of material for chemical looping combustion. Material is prepared by direct mixing of five metal oxides (CuO, Mn2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2, MgO), followed by calcination at 1000, 1100 and 1200 °C for 6h in air. XRD characterization provides strong evidence that the synthesized oxygen carriers possess the hallmark properties of HEO, and SEM-EDX analysis shows an overall homogeneous metal distribution. Materials have one main cubic phase with the empirical formula MnCuMgFeTiO7, dominating under all conditions. One of the key objectives of this study is achieved, reduce chemical stress during redox cycles. Oxygen transfer capability is investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and batch fluidized bed reactor experiments for different fuels and atmospheres. Mass-based oxygen transport capacities for lattice oxygen and oxygen uncoupling are around 5.5wt% and 1.1wt%, respectively. This work opens up a new dimension for the future preparation of oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes, since the vast compositional space of HEO provides opportunities to tune both chemical and physical characteristics.

Abstract The sluggish reaction kinetics has greatly hampered the development of reversible Li‐CO 2 batteries. Especially during charge, high charge voltage and possible side reactions during Li 2 CO 3 decomposition require both high activity and strong durability of catalysts. Herein, a strategy of introducing rich sulfur vacancies is proposed, which tailors the configuration of Li 2 CO 3 and the orbital structure of CoS to realize the dual enhancement. The calculation results show that charge redistribution by sulfur vacancies on the catalyst stretches the adsorbed Li 2 CO 3 and consequently facilitates its decomposition. Moreover, the induced vacancies lower the S 2p band center, promoting the electrochemical stability of sulfides. Therefore, Li‐CO 2 batteries with sulfur vacancy‐rich CoS exhibit a low overpotential of 1.07 V after 400 h cycling, while batteries with pristine CoS have a short lifespan that the overpotential exceeds 1.75 V after cycling for 200 h. This study not only proposes a strategy to improve both catalytic activity and stability but also paves new avenues for designing advanced catalysts for Li‐CO 2 batteries and beyond. image

Abstract The demand for hydrogen production technology to replace fossil fuels and address the global climate crisis has become one of the most urgent tasks in the modern era. Among the promising breakthroughs, electrochemical water splitting using renewable energy sources offers a path to green hydrogen production that is both feasible and economically viable. However, the current state‐of‐the‐art catalysts for the water‐splitting reaction predominantly rely on scarce and costly noble metals, posing a significant challenge to the mass production of green hydrogen. In this context, two‐dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) have emerged as compelling candidates to replace noble metals, owing to their impressive reactivity and cost‐effectiveness. These TMD‐based electrocatalysts demonstrate exceptional reactivity at their active edge sites, while the basal planes remain catalytically inert. Several tailored strategies can activate these basal planes by modifying the chemical bonding nature and electronic band structure of the constituent atoms, thus enhancing the overall reactivity of TMDs. This review summarizes recent advancements in the modulation methodologies of 2D TMDs to enhance their water‐splitting reactivity. We highlight various chemical modification strategies, including heteroatom doping, defect‐engineering, and heterostructure formation, and provide insights into future research directions for the development of advanced 2D TMD‐based water‐splitting catalysts.

Surface charges of catalysts have important influences on the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Herein, we develop a modified version of the grand-canonical potential kinetics (GCP-K) method based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the effect of surface charges on reaction thermodynamics and kinetics. Using the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the Pt(111) surface as an example, we show how to track the change of surface charge in a reaction and how to analyze its influence on the kinetics. Grand-canonical calculations demonstrate that the optimum hydrogen adsorption energy on Pt under the standard hydrogen electrode condition (SHE) is around −0.2 eV, rather than 0 eV established under the canonical ensemble, due to the high density of surface negative charges. By separating the surface charges that can freely exchange with the external electron reservoir, we obtain a Tafel barrier that is in good agreement with the experimental result. During the Tafel reaction, the net electron inflow into the catalyst leads to a stabilization of canonical energy and a destabilization of the charge-dependent grand-canonical component. This study provides a practical method for obtaining accurate grand-canonical reaction energetics and analyzing the surface charge induced changes.

Abstract The effects of B‐site substitution (B═Mn, Fe, and Co) in La‐based perovskite oxides (LPOs); LaMnO 3 , LaFeO 3 , LaCoO 3 , as bifunctional electrocatalysts during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in metal–air batteries (MABs) under an alkaline electrolyte (pH = 13) are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). It is found that LaMnO 3 exhibits higher ORR activity than others with ORR overpotential ( η ORR ) of 0.57 V, but its OER activity is poor with OER overpotential ( η OER ) of 1.12 V. The η ORR (0.59 V) and η OER (1.13 V) of LaMn 0.75 Fe 0.25 O 3 closely resemble those of LaMnO 3 , suggesting that Fe substitution does not yield appreciable enhancements in activity. Fe substitution reduces the ORR and OER activity because the adsorption energies of intermediate species on Fe‐substituted LPOs surfaces are too strong to obtain a potential determining step for ORR and OER. According to Sabatier's principle, the LaMn 0.25 Co 0.75 O 3 demonstrates superior OER activity compared to the other composition, while ORR activity approximates that of LaMnO 3 , evidenced by η ORR of 0.65 V and η OER of 0.53 V. The Co‐terminated LaMn 0.25 Co 0.75 O 3 shows bifunctional activity higher than Mn/Co termination, indicating that Co is an active site for OER and Mn is a promoter for improved ORR activity.

Ammonia has gained more interest as a promising candidate to produce clean and renewable hydrogen energy in recent years. It is crucial to develop a new and efficient method for improving the performance of NH3 synthesis. Nowadays, electrochemical NH3 synthesis by direct NO reduction has become an alternative to the Haber–Bosch process. Herein, the performance of a NO reduction reaction (NORR) on 33 different H-functionalized MXenes (H-MXenes) has been investigated by the combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Through surface Pourbaix diagrams and Gibbs free-energy calculations, the reaction mechanism and limiting potential (UL) of the NORR on the H-MXenes are investigated. The DFT calculations demonstrate that the surface H could regulate the strength of NO adsorption, lower the free energy of the elemental step, effectively reduce the limiting potential, and hence improve the NORR performance. Furthermore, the results on the LASSO regression indicate a good fitting between the expression consisting of the combined descriptors from 1D to 4D and the UL values from the DFT calculations. Moreover, |Gv−ENO|2|GNO| is regarded as human-readable NORR performance descriptors with R2 = 0.83. This work not only provides a deep insight into the important role of H-functionalization in NORR but also profits to understand the originals of the NORR activity for the high-throughput screening of NH3 synthesis catalysts.

Abstract Designing high‐performance and low‐cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for the conversion and storage of sustainable energy technologies. Inspired by the biomineralization process, we utilized the phosphorylation sites of collagen molecules to combine with cobalt‐based mononuclear precursors at the molecular level and built a three‐dimensional (3D) porous hierarchical material through a bottom‐up biomimetic self‐assembly strategy to obtain single‐atom catalysts confined on carbonized biomimetic self‐assembled carriers (Co SACs/cBSC) after subsequent high‐temperature annealing. In this strategy, the biomolecule improved the anchoring efficiency of the metal precursor through precise functional groups; meanwhile, the binding‐then‐assembling strategy also effectively suppressed the nonspecific adsorption of metal ions, ultimately preventing atomic agglomeration and achieving strong electronic metal‐support interactions (EMSIs). Experimental characterizations confirm that binding forms between cobalt metal and carbonized self‐assembled substrate (Co–O 4 –P). Theoretical calculations disclose that the local environment changes significantly tailored the Co d‐band center, and optimized the binding energy of oxygenated intermediates and the energy barrier of oxygen release. As a result, the obtained Co SACs/cBSC catalyst can achieve remarkable OER activity and 24 h durability in 1 M KOH ( η 10 at 288 mV; Tafel slope of 44 mV dec −1 ), better than other transition metal‐based catalysts and commercial IrO 2 . Overall, we presented a self‐assembly strategy to prepare transition metal SACs with strong EMSIs, providing a new avenue for the preparation of efficient catalysts with fine atomic structures.

Abstract Hydrogen (H 2 ) has been regarded as a promising alternative to fossil‐fuel energy. Green H 2 produced via water electrolysis (WE) powered by renewable energy could achieve a zero‐carbon footprint. Considerable attention has been focused on developing highly active catalysts to facilitate the reaction kinetics and improve the energy efficiency of WE. However, the stability of the electrocatalysts hampers the commercial viability of WE. Few studies have elucidated the origin of catalyst degradation. In this review, we first discuss the WE mechanism, including anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Then, we provide strategies used to enhance the stability of electrocatalysts. After that, the deactivation mechanisms of the typical commercialized HER and OER catalysts, including Pt, Ni, RuO 2 , and IrO 2 , are summarized. Finally, the influence of fluctuating energy on catalyst degradation is highlighted and in situ characterization methodologies for understanding the dynamic deactivation processes are described.

Recently, there has been a notable surge in interest regarding reclaiming valuable chemicals from waste plastics. However, the energy-intensive conventional thermal catalysis does not align with the concept of sustainable development. Herein, we report a sustainable electrocatalytic approach allowing the selective synthesis of glycolic acid (GA) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) over a Pd 67 Ag 33 alloy catalyst under ambient conditions. Notably, Pd 67 Ag 33 delivers a high mass activity of 9.7 A mg Pd −1 for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and GA Faradaic efficiency of 92.7 %, representing the most active catalyst for selective GA synthesis. In situ experiments and computational simulations uncover that ligand effect induced by Ag incorporation enhances the GA selectivity by facilitating carbonyl intermediates desorption, while the lattice mismatch-triggered tensile strain optimizes the adsorption of *OH species to boost reaction kinetics. This work unveils the synergistic of strain and ligand effect in alloy catalyst and provides guidance for the design of future catalysts for PET upcycling. We further investigate the versatility of Pd 67 Ag 33 catalyst on CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) and assemble EGOR//CO 2 RR integrated electrolyzer, presenting a pioneering demonstration for reforming waste carbon resource (i.e., PET and CO 2 ) into high-value chemicals.

This comprehensive review article highlights recent advancements of Pt and Pd-based electrocatalysts, covering Pt and Pd alloys, Pt-M and Pd-M core-shell structures, nanosize/nanostructure effects, addition of support material, doping effects, and post-treatment for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Additionally, it delves into other precious metals such as Gold (Au) and Silver (Ag) for ORR and HOR in PEMFC. The role and contribution of incorporating other elements or materials such as metal oxides, metal carbides, transition metal oxides, carbon support, and non-carbon support are thoroughly discussed. The most promising methods are also described, with a special emphasis on narrow particle size, nanostructure, and low loading of novel Pt- and Pd-based catalysts. Furthermore, the advantages and shortcomings of these catalysts for electrocatalysis are analyzed, along with the influence of the nanostructure and morphology of the electrocatalyst materials on electrochemical performance.

Abstract Supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) modules with bipolar stacks having 2, 4, 8, and 12 electrode pairs made from BPL 4 × 6 activated carbon are constructed and tested for carbon dioxide capture applications. Tests are performed with simulated flue gas (15%CO 2 /85%N 2 ) at 2, 4, 8, and 12 V, respectively. Reversible adsorption with sorption capacities (≈58 mmol kg −1 ) and adsorption rates (≈38 µmol kg −1 s −1 ) are measured for all stacks. The productivity scales with the number of cells in the module, and increases from 70 to 390 mmol h −1 m −2 . The energy efficiency and energy consumption improve with increasing number of bipolar electrodes from 67% to 84%, and 142 to 60 kJ mol −1 , respectively. Overall, the results show that SSA modules with bipolar electrodes can be scaled without reducing the adsorptive performance, and with improvement of energetic performance.

Nickel manganese oxide nanoparticles (NiMnO3 NPs) have been synthesized by a solution combustion method, varying the metal-to-fuel ratios. The obtained compounds were characterized by several techniques, including X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, FESEM and HR-TEM. The optical band gap decreased with increasing crystallite size. The BET analysis revealed a decrease in surface area with increasing crystallite size. Crystallite size dependent electrochemical investigations of the NiMnO3 NPs were carried out using a three-electrode system. The NiMnO3 NPs were observed to be a better supercapacitor material with a specific capacitance of 65.45 F/g at 1 A/g. The specific capacitance decreased linearly with the cumulative current densities, which is the characteristic behavior of electrochemical supercapacitors. The degradation of RB increased with the enhancement in the crystallinity of the sample. The proportion of RB dye degradation was found to be 99.89% in two hours. The enhancement of photodegradation and the supercapacitor property of the NiMnO3 NPs are attributed to the reduction in the band gap due to increase in crystallite size.

Abstract The structure–property hypothesis says that the properties of all materials are determined by an underlying crystal structure. The main obstacle was the ambiguity of conventional crystal representations based on incomplete or discontinuous descriptors that allow false negatives or false positives. This ambiguity was resolved by the ultra-fast pointwise distance distribution, which distinguished all periodic structures in the world’s largest collection of real materials (Cambridge structural database). State-of-the-art results in property prediction were previously achieved by graph neural networks based on various graph representations of periodic crystals, including the Crystal Graph with vertices at all atoms in a crystal unit cell. This work adapts the pointwise distance distribution for a simpler graph whose vertex set is not larger than the asymmetric unit of a crystal structure. The new Distribution Graph reduces mean absolute error by 0.6–12% while having 44–88% of the number of vertices when compared to the Crystal Graph when applied on the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT datasets using CGCNN and ALIGNN. Methods for hyper-parameters selection for the graph are backed by the theoretical results of the pointwise distance distribution and are then experimentally justified.
