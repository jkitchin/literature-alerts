Remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts have been prepared by assembling bimetallic CoFe nanoparticles on hierarchically meso-macroporous N-doped carbon nanospheres. Metal–nitrogen–carbon catalysts are emerging as promising alternatives to Pt/C for ORR; however, their performance is limited by the low density and accessibility of active metal sites. The present hierarchically structured meso-macroporous N-doped carbon provides abundant exposed sites for active metal species. The bimetallic CoFe nanoparticles, in turn, significantly increase the total density of active catalytic sites for ORR. Consequently, the optimized CoFe nanoparticles embedded in meso-macroporous N-doped carbon (CoFe@MesoMacroNC) deliver superior ORR activities in both alkali and acidic media, achieving half-wave potentials of 0.943 V vs RHE and 0.811 V vs RHE, respectively. In addition, when CoFe@MesoMacroNC is used in a Zn–air battery, it shows a higher power density of 155 mW cm–2 as compared with that of commercial Pt/C (137 mW cm–2) as well as better stability.

Power plants are one of the main sources emitting the CO2 that is responsible for climate change consequences. Post-combustion carbon capture (PCC), particularly using an aqueous solution, is highly recommended to be used as a mitigation solution to reduce the emissions of CO2 from power plants. Although PCC is a promising solution, the process still needs further development to reduce the energy demand for solvent regeneration. This paper reviews the challenges related to the post-combustion processes and finds the correlations between selected variables addressed by several researchers. Moreover, this study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the reduction in energy demand and efficiency penalties. The research findings highlight the importance of considering two key drivers during the design of the PCC process. These are the absorber temperature and the type and amount of the selected solvent. Indeed, statistical analyses show that there is a correlation between the identified drivers’ values and the energy demand of solvent regeneration.

ABSTRACT In the present study, magnetron‐sputtered Pt x M 100− x (M = Co, Cu, and Y; x = 25, 50, 75, and 100) bimetallic alloys were investigated as PEMFC cathodes. Accurate composition and layer thickness control enabled a systematic study of the correlation between the alloy composition, its activity, and stability. The catalysts underwent thorough characterization, employing a diverse portfolio of characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and cyclic voltammetry. The activity of all investigated alloys was tested directly in a fuel cell device, whereas stability was assessed through potentiodynamic cycling in a half‐cell. The activity–stability index, considering experimental results for both activity and stability, was calculated and compared for all investigated catalysts. All alloys exhibited a volcano‐type trend in the activity–stability index as a function of the concentration of the alloying element with maxima observed for Pt 50 Co 50 , Pt 50 Cu 50 , and Pt 75 Y 25 for respective alloys, surpassing that of monometallic platinum. Overall, Pt 50 Co 50 emerged as a catalyst with the highest activity–stability ratio.

The electrochemical reduction reaction (RR) of CO to high value multicarbon products is highly desirable for carbon utilization. Dual transition metal atoms dispersed by N-doped graphene are able to be highly efficient catalysts for this process due to the synergy of the bimetallic sites for C–C coupling. In this work, we screened homonuclear dual-atom catalysts dispersed by N-doped graphene to investigate the potential in CO reduction to C2+ products by employing density functional theory calculations. We have demonstrated that the two adsorbed CO species on bimetallic sites cannot directly couple unless one of the CO molecules is hydrogenated. All the dual metal atom catalysts prefer a similar coupling mechanism, i.e., the asymmetric coupling of *CO on the bridged site and *CHO on the top site, while the Ni2 and Cu2 catalysts exhibit much better performance with moderate adsorption energies and low energy barriers. The enhanced activities are attributed to the decrease of the energy levels of *CO 2p states that weakens the metal–C bonding and thus facilitates the feasible C–C coupling with both low reaction energies and low barriers. These insights have revealed the significant role of the hydrogenation of CO species prior to the coupling step and may provide a theoretical perspective to understand the generation of C2+ products in the CO2/CORR.

Los materiales de un único átomo metal-nitrógeno-carbono son la mejor alternativa a los catalizadores de metales preciosos en las celdas de combustible de hidrógeno y los electrolizadores de CO2. Sin embargo, su síntesis está limitada por la pirólisis a alta temperatura, lo que conlleva la formación de nanopartículas y resulta en un bajo número de sitios activos poco accesibles. Por lo tanto, las técnicas sintéticas que permiten la coordinación de átomos aislados en una matriz de carbono post-pirólisis han recibido mucha atención. En esta perspectiva, comentamos los trabajos más recientes en el campo de los electrocatalizadores Fe-N-C, y nos enfocamos en las técnicas sintéticas de reemplazo de cationes Zn y Mg para evitar la agregación de Fe.

Realization of a sustainable hydrogen economy in the future requires the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for its production at scale. MXenes (Mn+1Xn) are a class of 2D materials with 'n' layers of carbon or nitrogen (X) interleaved by 'n+1' layers of transition metal (M) and have emerged as promising materials for various applications including catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Their properties are intimately related to both their composition and their atomic structure. Recently, high entropy MXenes were synthesized, opening a vast compositional space of potentially stable and functionally superior materials. Detailed atomistic modeling enables us to systematically explore this extensive design space, which is otherwise infeasible in experiments. We have developed a Neural Network Potential (NNP) to model (TixVyNbzMop)n+1Cn MXenes (x+y+z+p = 1; n = 1,2,3) by training against Density Functional Theory (DFT) data in an active learning fashion. We then used the developed NNP to perform hybrid Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD) simulations to identify thermodynamically stable compositions and investigate the relative arrangement of transition metal atoms within and across layers. Thermodynamic stability increased with Mo content and its presence on the surface layer. We further investigated the catalytic performance of stable MXenes for the HER and observed that the center of the oxygen p-band (εp) correlated well with the energy of adsorption of a hydrogen atom ΔG(*H). Subsurface metal atoms significantly influenced the ΔG(*H) values at the surface via both ligand and strain effects. Our work expands the space of potentially stable MXene compositions, providing targets for synthesis and their evaluation in various applications.

Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen generation requires a cutting‐edge, multifunctional electrocatalyst with abundant active sites to drive multielectron transfer reactions. High entropy alloys (HEA) are complex five or more‐element alloy systems with high configurational entropy which makes them unique materials for next‐generation electrocatalysts. Here, in this work, based on new screening guidelines for catalyst selections that combine density‐functional theory calculated Gibbs formation‐enthalpy with bond length and electronegativity variance, a novel HEA electrocatalyst consisting of five elements, namely, Pt, Pd, Ni, Co, and Mn is designed. By simple room temperature electrodeposition, the designed catalyst is prepared and its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is explored and validated through experimental and theoretical approaches. The HEA demonstrated a superior HER activity with an overpotential of 22.6 mV at −10 mA cm −2 which outperforms Pt/C commercial catalyst. No evident degradation of the material is detected even after 100 hours of continuous operation under high current density. Moreover, the HEA has shown exceptional performance in harsh electrolyte conditions such as in simulated seawater and actual seawater. Remarkably, the density‐functional theory calculated small Gibbs formation‐enthalpy (≈0 eV) compared to Pt/C places the new HEA near the apex of Trasatti's model of Volcano plot, which is also suggestive of superior HER activity.

The evolution of bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts that are highly active, stable, and conductive is crucial for advancing metal-air batteries and fuel cells. We have here thoroughly explored the OER and ORR performance for a category of two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) called TM3(HADQ)2, and Rh3(HADQ)2 exhibits a promising bifunctional OER/ORR activity, with an overpotential of 0.31 V for both OER and ORR. The d-band center (εd) and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) are utilized to study the relationship between OER/ORR activity and the electronic structure of catalysts, and it is found that the elementary d-electron number (Ne) of the central TM for TM3(HADQ)2, as well as the electronegativity of the ligand TM-N4 and the intermediate O atom, are the main reason that affects the catalytic activity of OER/ORR. Additionally, Rh3(HADQ)2 can be proven through the constant potential method (CPM) and microkinetics method that it is an acidic OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst. Rh3(HADQ)2 has a high toxicity tolerance, making it a potential bifunctional catalyst. Our research contributes to both the rational design of SACs for various catalytic processes and the fabrication of bifunctional, cost-effective oxygen-electric catalysts.

Using the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) as the indicator, five borophene phases are previously shown to possess high catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). On these borophene phases, we investigate the role of the coordination number (CN = 4, 5, 6) of the adsorption sites and the puckering of the adsorption site. CN is discovered to have a profound effect on the ΔGH distribution, charge, and puckering height (h) of adsorption sites. Employing bonding indicators, we investigated the puckering mechanism. An increase in h directly increases the bond order and bond strength of the adsorption bond, but the associated energy cost of bond stretching hinders further puckering. The occupation and localization of σ orbitals determine the strength of local σ bonds─the key factors determining h. External biaxial strain is revealed to monotonically modulate the 2s character in local σ bonds, thus affecting bond stretchability, altering h and ΔGH subsequently. These insights are valuable for borophene-based HER applications and provide an analytical framework for the adsorption on 2D materials.

Dynamic effects of catalysts play a crucial role in catalytic reactions, necessitating the incorporation of statistical sampling and understanding of the impact of dynamic structures in free energy calculations. However, the complexity of catalytic systems poses challenges in effectively exploring the vast configurational space effectively. In this work, we propose CatFlow, an automated workflow for training machine learning potentials (MLPs) to compute free energies of catalytic reactions. CatFlow combines constrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with concurrent training of MLPs and sequential calculation of free energies with well trained MLPs. By rapidly generating reliable MLPs, CatFlow facilitates rigorous free energy calculations, enabling the determination of the reaction profiles in an end-to-end manner. We showcased the capabilities of CatFlow by investigating the activation of O2 catalyzed by Pt clusters and demonstrated the effects of phase transition on the activities of the catalytic reaction. CatFlow offers an efficient and automated solution for studying the catalytic elementary reaction processes. It reduces the need for human intervention and provides researchers with a powerful tool to investigate free energies of dynamic catalysis.

The nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has emerged as a promising approach for wastewater treatment and ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Poly(triazine imide)/LiCl (PTI/LiCl), a highly crystalline carbon nitride with a well-defined structure, has shown significant potential in this field. In this study, the electronic properties and catalytic performance of PTI/LiCl for NO3RR were investigated through theoretical calculations. Band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) analyses show that the intercalation of Li+ and Cl– ions within the PTI pores enhances electronic conductivity and improves its electronic properties. The reduction of nitrate to NH3 through a series of intermediates on the PTI/LiCl (001) surface shows exothermic free energy changes for each elementary step. The catalyst demonstrates outstanding selectivity and stability, effectively suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and byproduct formation. Charge density difference and PDOS analyses confirm the orbital interactions between absorbed NO3 and Li ions. The study highlights the potential of PTI/LiCl as a low-cost, efficient electrocatalyst for NO3RR and provides theoretical and practical insights for the design of environmentally friendly catalysts.

The textile industry is a major contributor to environmental pollution, primarily through the discharge of wastewater loaded with dyes and contaminants that disrupt natural ecosystems. This study aims to develop a hybrid material by functionalizing carbon nanodots (CNDs) with the donor-π-acceptor organic dye L1 via amide coupling. By chemically modifying the surface of CNDs, we can enhance their multifunctionality and tailor their molecular composition. This innovative approach seeks to replace expensive dyes with cost-effective CNDs synthesized from citric acid and ethylenediamine using a domestic microwave oven, potentially improving the stability of the resulting hybrid. Additionally, TiO2 anatase particles were synthesized as a metal oxide platform and sensitized with both pristine materials and the CND-L1 hybrid. A range of physicochemical methods was employed to analyze the elemental, structural, and optical properties of these materials. In photocatalytic degradation tests of methyl orange, the sensitized catalysts demonstrated significantly improved efficiency compared to TiO2 alone. While CNDs exhibited good stability and enhanced L1’s stability, scavenger experiments revealed that holes and hydroxyl radicals play crucial roles in the degradation mechanism. This research underscores the promise of CND hybrids in advancing pollutant degradation technologies while reducing reliance on costly photocatalysts.

Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have transformed the field of molecular simulations by scaling "quantum-accurate" potentials to linear time complexity. While they provide more accurate reproduction of physical properties as compared to empirical force fields, it is still computationally costly to generate their training data sets from ab initio calculations. Despite the emergence of foundational or general MLPs for organic molecules and dense materials, it is unexplored if one general MLP can be effectively developed for a wide variety of nanoporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with different chemical moieties and geometric properties. Herein, by leveraging upon data-efficient equivariant MLPs, we demonstrate the possibility of developing a general MLP for nearly 3000 Zn-based MOFs. After curating a training data set comprising augmented MOF structures generated from density functional theory optimization, we validate the reliability of the general MLP in predicting accurate forces and energies when evaluated on a test set with chemically distinct MOF structures. Despite incurring slightly higher errors on structures containing rare chemical moieties, the general MLP can reliably reproduce physical (e.g., vibrational, thermodynamic, and mechanical) properties for a large sample of Zn-based MOFs. Crucially, by developing one MLP for many MOFs, the computational cost of high-throughput screening is potentially reduced by a few orders of magnitude. This enables us to predict quantum-accurate properties for notable Zn-MOFs that were previously uninvestigated via expensive theoretical calculations. To facilitate computational discovery among other families of complex chemical structures, we provide our data set and codes in the public Zenodo repository.

Abstract Precious metal‐based single‐atom catalysts (PM‐SACs) hosted in N‐doped carbon supports have shown new opportunities to revolutionize cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, stabilizing the high density of PM‐N x sites remains a challenge, primarily due to the inherently high free energy of isolated metal atoms, predisposing them to facile atomic agglomeration. Herein, a molten salt‐assisted synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare porous PM 1 /N‐C Pores (PM = Ru, Pt, and Pd) electrocatalysts with densely accessible PM‐N x sites. A hierarchically porous N‐doped carbon substrate (N‐C Pores ), synthesized via the NaCl‐assisted pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8, effectively improves the utilization of PM‐N x sites by increased reactants accessible surface area and reduced mass transfer resistance. In accordance with theoretical calculations, the as‐prepared Ru 1 /N‐C Pores , featuring superior intrinsic active Ru‐N 4 sites, exhibit outstanding ORR turnover frequency of 6.19 e − site −1 s −1 , and outperforms the commercial Pt/C with a 5.3‐fold of mass activity (5.83 ± 0.61 A mg −1 ) at 0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The commendable activity and stability of Ru 1 /N‐C Pores in a real fuel cell device further affirm its practical applicability.
