Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) offer a powerful way to overcome the limitations of ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations. However, a major challenge is the generation of high-quality training data sets, which typically require extensive ab initio calculations and intensive user intervention. Here, we introduce Strategic Configuration Sampling (SCS), an active learning framework to construct compact and comprehensive data sets for MLIP training. SCS introduces the usage of workflows for the automated generation and exploration of systems, collections of MD simulations where geometries and run conditions are set up automatically based on high-level, user defined inputs. To explore nontrivial atomic environments, initial geometries can be assembled dynamically via collaging of structures harvested from preceding runs. Multiple automated exploration workflows can be run in parallel, each with its own resource budget according to the computational complexity of each system. Besides leveraging the MLIP models trained iteratively, SCS also incorporates pretrained models to steer the exploration MD, thereby eliminating the need for an initial data set. By integrating widely used software, SCS provides a fully open-source, automatic, active learning framework for the generation of data sets in a high-throughput fashion. Case studies demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness to accelerate the deployment of MLIP in diverse materials science applications.

The dissociative dynamics of molecular H2 on the Au1/Ag(111) single-atom alloy (SAA) surface was systematically investigated through full-dimensional quantum dynamical calculations. A neural network-derived potential energy surface with a 4.2 meV root-mean-square error was employed to ensure high-fidelity simulations. Density functional theory calculations identified a reduced static dissociation barrier of 1.08 eV for the SAA system, compared to the 1.22 and 1.25 eV values for pristine Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces, respectively. Despite this energetic advantage, the six-dimensional quantum dynamical analysis revealed that the dissociation probabilities for H2 in the vibrational ground (v = 0) state exceeded those on Ag(111) only at kinetic energies below 1.33 eV. This reactivity suppression at elevated energies was attributed to the site-specific modulation induced by the Au dopant, which selectively enhanced reactivities at the top-Au, hcp, and fcc sites while inhibiting those at bridge and top-Ag sites. Furthermore, the vibrational excitation, rotational alignment, and rotational excitation effects were found to closely resemble those observed for H2 dissociation on pristine Ag(111), demonstrating that the fundamental dynamical characteristics of the reaction remain qualitatively preserved despite SAA modification. These findings provide critical insights into the interplay between local electronic structure modification and global reaction dynamics in SAA systems.

Abstract To realize a sustainable energy transition, water electrolysis—particularly proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE)—holds significant promise. However, practical deployment is hindered by the cost and instability of the anode catalyst, IrO 2 . Recent studies indicate that tuning the Ir─O bond distance, via doping or composite formation, is key to enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of IrO 2 ‐based electrocatalysts. Herein, a hybrid‐phase Ti‐incorporated IrO 2 electrocatalyst is developed, exhibiting outstanding OER activity (298.8 mV at 100 mA cm −2 ) and stability over 25 h. This improvement originates from asymmetric interatomic interactions introduced by Ti, as revealed by combined experimental X‐ray analyses and theoretical modeling. Ti incorporation induces tensile strain along the z‐axis in IrO 2 motifs, effectively reducing the average Ir─O bond distance and thereby enhancing OER activity. In situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy further confirms that at 1.5 V (vs. RHE), the elongated Ir─O bond facilitates ─OOH* intermediate formation while suppressing Ir dissolution, contributing to superior stability. These findings underscore the critical role of Ir─O bond engineering in balancing activity and durability, offering strategic insights for the rational design of high‐performance OER catalysts for renewable energy technologies.

Diatomic catalysts (DAs) exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the synergistic interplay between dual metals. However, their dynamic evolution remains unexplored under the working conditions. Herein, Sn-Co diatomic pairs on N-doped carbon with an asymmetric N3Sn-CoN3 structure (SnCoN6 DA) are rationally designed for promoting ORR activity and durability. The operando hydroxylation of SnCoN6 DA regulates O2 adsorption on Co, allowing more d orbitals to hybridize with O2 s/p orbitals. Furthermore, the *OH-Sn moiety serves as an electron modulator that upshifts the d-band center of Co, enabling stronger binding with *OOH and expediting subsequent O-O cleavage. Accordingly, the operando hydroxylation of SnCoN6 DA positively shifts the half-wave potential by 54 mV and enhances the kinetic current density by 16.1 times compared to those of the Co single-atom catalyst. The constructed Zn-air battery shows an ultralong cycling life span (more than 3650 h at 5 and 10 mA cm-2).

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process for sustainable energy, although renewable sources require the use of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, with IrO 2 -based materials being the gold standard under anodic polarization conditions. However, even for the (110) facet of a single-crystalline IrO 2 model electrode, the reaction mechanism is not settled yet due to contradictory reports in literature. In the present manuscript, we disentangle the conflicting results of previous theoretical studies in the density functional theory approximation. We demonstrate that dissimilar reaction mechanisms and limiting steps for the OER over IrO 2 (110) are obtained for different active surface configurations present on the IrO 2 electrode. In contrast to previous studies, we factor Walden-type mechanisms, in which the formation of the product O 2 and adsorption of the reactant H 2 O occur simultaneously, into the analysis of the elementary steps. Combining free-energy diagrams along the reaction coordinate and Bader charge analysis of the active site, we elucidate why mononuclear- or bifunctional-Walden pathways excel the traditional OER mechanisms for the OER over IrO 2 (110). Our computational methodology to identify the reaction mechanism and limiting step of proton-coupled electron transfer steps is widely applicable to electrochemical processes in the field of energy conversion and storage.

The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction is a key step in producing green hydrogen through water electrolysis, but its large-scale industrial application remains limited due to challenges with current electrocatalysts-particularly in terms of scalability, efficiency, and long-term stability. Here we show an industrially scalable synthesis of an active NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) catalyst using a room-temperature, atmospheric-pressure route. The process involves homogeneous alkalinization, where chloride ions nucleophilically attack an epoxide ring, producing a low-dimensional, defect-rich NiFe-LDH with pronounced iron clustering. In-situ spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations reveal that these structural features maximize the conversion of the NiFe-LDH to the catalytic active phase and minimize the energy barrier, improving catalytic efficiency. When used as the anode in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer operating at 70 °C, our material delivers 1 A cm⁻² at 1.69 V in a 5 cm2 full-cell setup, with notable durability compared to conventional NiFe-LDHs. This scalable approach could considerably lower the cost of green hydrogen production by enabling more efficient alkaline electrolyzers.

Nanoclusters designed with atomic precision are poised to transform next-generation electrode materials for energy devices due to their exceptional performance. However, traditional computational studies often focus solely on individual nanoclusters, neglecting the impact of structurally diverse, low-energy isomers that coexist in a sample. Herein, we present a data-driven approach to screen late-transition metal-based core-shell nanoclusters for bifunctional electrocatalysis. Utilizing geometric and electronic properties, we establish morphology-based relationships for activity and selectivity, emphasizing the critical role of structural diversity in fuel cell applications. We identify the unique single-cluster catalyst identity of M55 nanoclusters, where intermediate adsorption is primarily governed by the constituent metals' electronic and elemental characteristics. Our findings identified the Au48W7 nanocluster as the most efficient electrocatalyst, exhibiting the lowest bifunctional overpotential of 0.76 V, with ηOER = 0.33 V and ηORR = 0.43 V, highlighting its outstanding catalytic performance at the nano regime. Guided by the Sabatier principle, we highlight the limitations of conventional numerical methods and reshape the activity volcano, transitioning from RuO2 and Pt to Au/Ag-based nanoclusters. Furthermore, the trained ML model enables the screening of electrocatalysts for two- and four-electron pathways, steering selectivity between H2O2 and H2O formation. This study provides intuitive guidelines for designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, redefining activity volcanoes, and modulates selectivity in nanocluster alloys.

ABSTRACT Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is an eco‐friendly chemical with widespread industrial applications. However, the commercial anthraquinone process for H 2 O 2 production is energy‐intensive and environmentally harmful, highlighting the need for more sustainable alternatives. The electrochemical production of H 2 O 2 via the two‐electron water oxidation reaction (2e⁻ WOR) presents a promising route but is often hindered by low efficiency and selectivity, due to the competition with the oxygen evolution reaction. In this study, we employed high‐throughput computational screening and microkinetic modeling to design a series of efficient 2e⁻ WOR electrocatalysts from a library of 240 single‐metal‐embedded nitrogen heterocycle aromatic molecules (M‐NHAMs). These catalysts, primarily comprising post‐transition metals, such as Cu, Ni, Zn, and Pd, exhibit high activity for H 2 O 2 conversion with a limiting potential approaching the optimal value of 1.76 V. Additionally, they exhibit excellent selectivity, with Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 80% at overpotentials below 300 mV. Structure‐performance analysis reveals that the d ‐band center and magnetic moment of the metal center correlated strongly with the oxygen adsorption free energy (), suggesting these parameters as key catalytic descriptors for efficient screening and performance optimization. This study contributes to the rational design of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical production of H 2 O 2 , offering a sustainable solution for green energy and industrial applications.

Artificial photosynthesis provides an efficient strategy for solar energy storage via water splitting and CO2 reduction, but it remains a challenge in tuning artificial photosynthesis between these two competing reactions. Herein, we demonstrate photoinduced conversion of monometallic to bimetallic sites in a Fe-Co nitroprusside (FeCo-NP) to steer the reaction path from H2 evolution to CO2 reduction. Monometallic Co sites achieve efficient H2 production with 28.5 mmol g-1 activity and 85.4% selectivity. Photoinduced release of nitrosyl groups from Fe sites generates bimetallic Fe-Co sites, which suppress H2 evolution and enhance CO2 reduction, yielding 31.5 mmol g-1 activity and 87.3% selectivity for C1 products. Mechanistic investigations reveal that monometallic Co sites catalyze H2 evolution via H2O adsorption and O-H cleavage while bimetallic Fe-Co sites facilitate both H2O and CO2 adsorption and subsequent O and C hydrogenation for CO and HCOOH. This work uncovers a strategy to manipulate competing reaction pathways via photoinduced conversion of monometallic to bimetallic sites, which provides unique insights into addressing environmental issues and energy crises.

The article presents a concept that considers the prospects for the development of architecture as a significant part of an environmentally positive, sustainably functioning city integrated into the environment. At this stage of presenting the problem, such a city is the final stage of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals declared by the UN. The authors give an idea of three basic stages (periods) of urban development, from modernity to the achievement of the Goals, namely: industrial, post-industrial, sustainable. The concept of the principles of relations between cities and the ecological balance of adjacent regions corresponding to these stages is put forward. As a research method that formalizes the nature of the principles of ecological relations between the city and the surrounding region, the paradigm of biology as a science of living nature is taken. According to the chosen paradigm, the problems of integrating the city into the environment are considered from the standpoint of three possible types of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism. For each of the three types of symbiosis, examples of architectural and urban planning concepts are analyzed. A hypothesis is put forward about the current stage of the symbiotic relationship between architecture and the environment. A hypothesis is put forward about the beginning of the process of formation of architectural and urban planning approaches focused on an ecologically positive type of symbiosis of the city and the environment. The definition of a post-industrial city as a city of the transition period is given. A hypothesis is put forward about the basic principles of the formation of the architecture of a post-industrial city. The term "Compensatory-parasitic symbiosis" is proposed, which determines the principles of the functioning of the architecture of the transition period. The term "compensatory-parasitic type of architectural development" should be understood as such a formation of architectural and town-planning objects, in which the most effective compensation for damage caused by the city to the environment takes place.

Developing acid-stable and active ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for facilitating the large-scale applications of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) for hydrogen production. Here, we propose a strain heterogeneity engineering strategy to simultaneously enhance the OER stability and activity of RuO2 electrocatalysts by introducing single-atom platinum (Pt). In a PEM water electrolyzer, the resultant Pt-RuO2 catalyst archives 3 A cm-2 at a low voltage of 1.791 V and maintains a stable performance for over 500 h at 500 mA cm-2. These performance metrics highlight its potential for practical applications. Experiments and calculations analyses confirm that the bulk tensile strain effectively stabilizes the entire structure of electrocatalysts, while the regions of compressive strain are identified as highly active catalytic sites, where the weakened binding energy of oxo-intermediates improves the catalytic activity.

Abstract Volcanoes are not randomly located on Earth, neither are volcanologists. We explored the physical distance between volcanologists and volcanoes by considering two categories of volcanoes: all volcanoes with a confirmed eruption in the Holocene and volcanoes that erupted in the past 50 years (1974–2024). We computed the distance between these volcanoes and the affiliation addresses from volcanologists, defined here as authors having published in the main volcanology journals. We then investigated the dependence of this distance on further bibliometric parameters, such as the journal published in or the author position. Affiliations were extracted from articles published since 1980 in four of the main English-speaking volcanology-focused journals in the Scopus database. Around 27% of volcanologists are based within 100 km of a Holocene volcano, compared to 14% of the world population. More than 85% of volcanologists are within 1000 km of a Holocene volcano, but 48% need to travel over 1000 km to visit a volcano that erupted in the past 50 years. We tested whether distance to the nearest volcano correlates with author position. We observed that researchers working nearer volcanoes tend to lead articles with more co-authors, which is robustly supported by statistical tests. We also found that authors in further positions tend to be based nearer recently active volcanoes, though this correlation is less significant. Using keywords to identify each article’s studied volcano, we performed single volcano analysis for the 25 most frequently studied volcanoes in the dataset. We observed significant differences in the distance from authors to the target volcano. For instance, we obtained median author-volcano distances of 9 km for Campi Flegrei and 11,735 km for Merapi. Our analyses also permitted a very simplistic estimate of the carbon footprint from fieldwork travel, yielding CO $$_{\varvec{2}}$$     2     equivalent emissions of about 1 ton per travelling author, with an order of magnitude uncertainty. The database presented is very rich and could serve future efforts in science strategy, equality, diversity and inclusivity, outreach, and sustainability.

Abstract Proton‐exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) require durable and efficient catalyst supports to overcome the limitations of Pt‐based catalysts and conventional low‐crystalline carbon (LCC) supports, such as high cost, susceptibility to corrosion, and poor electrochemical durability. While highly crystalline carbon (HCC) offers improved stability, its intrinsic hydrophobicity and low defect density hinder Pt nanoparticles (NPs) nucleation and dispersion. In this study, a spin‐on‐dopant (SOD) approach is employed to synthesize phosphorus‐incorporated HCC (HCC P ) providing stable anchoring sites that facilitate uniform Pt NPs distribution. Compared to commercial Pt/LCC, Pt/HCC P exhibits enhanced thermal stability and oxidation resistance, with an oxidation onset temperature ≈90 °C higher. Accelerated durability tests reveal only a 2 mV half‐wave potential shift and a minimal electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss of 1.9% after 20 000 cycles, significantly lower than the 47.1% ECSA loss observed for Pt/LCC. Single‐cell tests further confirm that Pt/HCC P retains 92.4% of its initial power density, outperforming Pt/LCC. The incorporation of phosphorus improves Pt NPs stabilization on the superhydrophobic HCC surface, enhancing Pt utilization and long‐term durability. This study provides valuable insights into the development of high‐performance carbon supports for PEMFC catalysts.

The development of advanced catalysts with innovative nanoarchitectures is critical for addressing energy and environmental challenges such as the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Herein, the synthesis of an innovative copper–sulfur planar structure, Cu–S–BDC, within a metal–organic framework (MOF) catalyst is presented, which demonstrates 100% selectivity toward formate as the sole carbon product. Structural analysis and surface characterizations reveal that Cu–S–BDC exhibits quasi‐2D inorganic building units, with Cu bonded to two S‐CH groups and one BDC linker, while carboxylate groups adopt a bridging coordination mode. This unique arrangement not only imparts remarkable structural stability but also enhances the electronic properties of the MOF, as evidenced by a narrow bandgap of 1.203 eV that facilitates efficient charge transfer and increased electrochemical current density in CORR. Notably, it offers a Faradaic efficiency of 92% for formate at an overpotential as low as −0.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an aqueous electrolyte of 1 m KOH, as well as a current density of −25.8 mA cm 2 at −0.9 V versus RHE, averaged over 24 h of electrolysis. This study highlights a fresh perspective in the field of MOF electrocatalysts by demonstrating that engineering the metal coordination environment can significantly enhance the electronic properties and consequently improve the electrocatalytic performance of these materials.

This review provides an overview of recent advancements in cathode materials for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), focusing on their role in catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This begins with a fundamental discussion of the ORR mechanism, including two‐electron and four‐electron pathways. The review then explores a wide range of electrocatalyst materials, starting with precious metal catalysts, particularly platinum‐based materials, along with alloying strategies and composite structures. This then delves into nonprecious metal catalysts, encompassing metal‐free ORR electrocatalysts, carbon‐supported composite materials (including heteroatom doping and metal‐carbon composites), and transition metal oxides. The review further examines metal phthalocyanines, biomass‐derived catalysts, bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticles supported on carbon matrices, and chalcogenides (oxides, sulfides, and selenides) as ORR electrocatalysts. Advanced materials such as single‐ and dual‐atom catalysts, high‐entropy alloys, and metal organic frameworks derived electrocatalysts are also discussed. We analyze the identification of reaction sites and the effect of structure on catalytic activity. Furthermore, the review covers electrochemical measurements in PEMFCs and explores technological applications and industrial relevance, including products and patents. Finally, this review concludes by addressing future perspectives and challenges in the field of cathode materials for PEMFCs.

Abstract Peroxidase (POD)‐like nanozymes have emerged as effective alternatives to natural enzymes owing to their stability and cost‐effectiveness in biosensors. In particular, single‐atom nanozymes (SAzymes) featuring Fe–N 4 active sites have attracted significant attention for their high catalytic performance. However, their 2D exposed active sites result in limited reaction selectivity and strong pH dependence, restricting their functionality under neutral conditions. This study introduces Ru‐centered SAzymes coordinated out‐of‐plane with chlorine ligands (RuNC_Cl), achieving monofunctional POD‐like activity. RuNC_Cl exhibited remarkable POD‐like activity, which is 38‐fold greater than its catalase (CAT)‐like activity, indicating strong suppression of the competing CAT‐like reaction. Density functional theory calculations and Bader charge analysis of RuNC_Cl reveal that repulsive forces preventing secondary H 2 O 2 adsorption contribute to an increased energy barrier for the CAT‐like reaction. This selective POD‐like activity enables the precise detection of multiple biomarkers through a one‐pot cascade reaction under near‐neutral conditions. This advancement paves the way for the precise regulation of reaction pathways, enhancing the practicality of nanozymes for biosensing and related applications.

Abstract Dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) embedded in nitrogen‐doped graphene have been widely studied for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R), primarily yielding CO. However, achieving selectivity for C1 hydrocarbons remains challenging. Here, 32 Janus DACs (J‐M'M) are designed and investigated for CO 2 R using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, identifying 13 capable of producing methanol and methane. Notably, J‐FeCo and J‐CoNi exhibit favorable limiting potentials (−0.38 and −0.45 V vs. RHE) for CH 3 OH and CH 4 production, respectively, based on constant‐potential calculations. Compared to normal DACs (N‐M'M), Janus DACs demonstrate enhanced initial CO 2 hydrogenation and stronger CO adsorption. Oxygen coordination in J‐FeCo and J‐CoNi induces a downshift/upshift of majority‐/minority‐spin energy levels of d z2 , d yz , and d xz orbitals toward the Fermi level relative to N‐FeCo and N‐CoNi, strengthening the bonding state and weakening the antibonding state, thereby improving CO adsorption. Furthermore, an effective descriptor based on atomic features is identified to evaluate *CO binding strength. This work highlights the critical role of partial oxygen coordination in DACs for C1 hydrocarbons production and proposes a robust descriptor to guide the design of related catalysts.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can enable simulations of ab initio accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. However, their effectiveness hinges on the availability of considerable data sets to ensure robust generalization across chemical space and thermodynamic conditions. The generation of such data sets can be labor-intensive, highlighting the need for innovative methods to train MLPs in data-scarce scenarios. Here, we introduce transfer learning of potential energy surfaces between chemically similar elements. Specifically, we leverage the trained MLP for silicon to initialize and expedite the training of an MLP for germanium. Utilizing classical force field and ab initio data sets, we demonstrate that transfer learning surpasses traditional training from scratch in force prediction, leading to more stable simulations and improved temperature transferability. These advantages become even more pronounced as the training data set size decreases. We also observe positive transfer learning effects for most out-of-target properties. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning across chemical elements is a promising technique for developing accurate and numerically stable MLPs, particularly in a data-scarce regime.
