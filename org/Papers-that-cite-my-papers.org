Chalcogenide perovskites are lead-free materials for potential photovoltaic or thermoelectric applications. BaZrS3 is the most-studied member of this family due to its superior thermal and chemical stability, desirable optoelectronic properties, and low thermal conductivity. Phase transitions in BaZrS3 remain underexplored in the literature, as most experimental characterizations of this material have been performed at ambient conditions where the orthorhombic Pnma phase is reported to be stable. In this work, we study the dynamics of BaZrS3 across a range of temperatures and pressures using an accurate machine learning interatomic potential trained with data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. At 0 Pa, we find a first-order phase transition from the orthorhombic to tetragonal I4/mcm phase at 610 K, and a second-order transition from the tetragonal to the cubic Pm3̅m phase at 880 K. The tetragonal phase is stable over a larger temperature range at higher pressures. To confirm the validity of our model we compare our results with a range of published experimental data and report a prediction for the X-ray diffraction pattern as a function of temperature.

Understanding the semiconductor-electrolyte interface in photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems is crucial for optimizing the stability and reactivity. Despite the challenges in establishing reliable surface structure models during PEC cycles, this study explores the complex surface reconstructions of BiVO4(010) by employing a computational workflow integrated with a state-of-the-art active learning protocol for a machine-learning interatomic potential and global optimization techniques. Within this workflow, we identified 494 unique reconstructed surface structures that surpass conventional chemical intuition-driven, bulk-truncated models. After constructing the surface Pourbaix diagram under Bi- and V-rich electrolyte conditions using density functional theory and hybrid functional calculations, we proposed structural models for the experimentally observed Bi-rich BiVO4 surfaces. By performing hybrid functional molecular dynamics simulations with the explicit treatment of water molecules on selected reconstructed BiVO4(010) surfaces, we observed water dissociation from molecular water. Our findings demonstrate significant water dissociation on reconstructed Bi-rich surfaces, highlighting the critical role of bare and undercoordinated Bi sites (only observable in reconstructed surfaces) in driving hydration processes. Our work establishes a foundation for understanding the role of complex, reconstructed Bi surfaces in surface hydration and reactivity. Additionally, our theoretical framework for exploring surface structures and predicting reactivity in multicomponent oxides offers a precise approach to describing complex surface and interface processes in PEC systems.

Abstract Applying electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) to produce ammonia offers a sustainable alternative to the energy‐intensive Haber‐Bosch process, which is crucial for clean energy and agricultural applications. While 2D MXenes hold great promise as electrocatalysts for NO 3 RR, their application for ammonia production remains underexplored. This study combines experimental and theoretical approaches to evaluate the catalytic performance of a series of MXenes with different central metal atoms for NO 3 RR. Among the materials studied (Ti 3 C 2 T x , Ti 3 CNT x , Ti 2 CT x , V 2 CT x , Cr 2 CT x , Nb 2 CT x , and Ta 2 CT x ), Ti 3 ‐based MXenes exhibit superior faradaic efficiency, ammonia yield rate, and stability. Density functional theory calculations offer further insights explaining the structure‐activity‐based observations. This research establishes a foundation for future studies aimed at leveraging MXenes for electrochemical nitrate reduction for green synthesis of ammonia.

Abstract Solid‐state crystalline multimetal oxides have been widely studied for their applications as electrode materials, e. g., in fuel cells, water electrolyzer, lithium‐ion batteries, and metal‐air batteries. Particularly, hydrogen production via water electrolysis is considered a key technology for realizing a sustainable circular carbon society. Enhancing the activity of electrocatalysts is a critical challenge for improving the efficiency of the water electrolysis technology. Thus, strategies for designing prominent catalyst materials have drawn considerable attention. Our group has been conducting research aimed at establishing comprehensive design strategies for the rational and rapid development of highly active catalysts. In this Personal Account, we present our research efforts on enhancing the activity of cost‐efficient nonprecious metal‐based oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode of water electrolysis. Specifically, we propose design strategies based on crystal structures of multimetal oxides and demonstrate how these strategies have contributed to the development of highly active electrocatalysts.

Abstract Photocatalysis has emerged as an alternative to high energy‐demanding CO 2 reduction reactions. Among the widely studied photocatalysts, g‐C 3 N 4 stands out due to its composition based on earth‐abundant elements, its ability to absorb visible light, and its suitable band structure. In this study, a photocatalyst based on an S‐scheme heterojunction formed by g‐C 3 N 4 and nanosized Fe 2 TiO 5 is successfully prepared via simple hydrothermal assembly of both pre‐synthesized semiconductors. Modifications induced on g‐C 3 N 4 during the heterojunction preparation play a crucial role in the efficiency of the CO 2 photoreduction reaction. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the g‐C 3 N 4 /Fe 2 TiO 5 heterojunction exhibits higher photocatalytic performance than the pristine materials for both CO 2 reduction to produce CO and CH 4 , and H 2 O reduction reaction, producing H 2 . The results obtained correspond to a 1.5‐fold improvement compared to pristine g‐C 3 N 4 . When [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ is applied as a sensitizer, the visible light (>380 nm) activity of the photocatalytic system is restored, showing lower activity but higher selectivity toward CO and H 2 production, a route to renewable syngas.

Developing stable and effective catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been a long-standing pursuit. In this work, we propose a series of single-atom catalysts (SACs) by importing transition-metal atoms into the carbon and vanadium vacancies of tetragonal V2C2 and V3C3 slabs, where the transition-metal atoms refer to Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. By means of first-principles computations, the possibility of applying these SACs in HER catalysis was investigated. All the SACs are conductive, which is favorable to charge transfer during HER. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔGH*) during hydrogen adsorption was adopted to assess their catalytic ability. For the V2C2-based SACs with V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Cu located at the carbon vacancy, excellent HER catalytic performance was achieved, with a |ΔGH*| smaller than 0.2 eV. Among the V3C3-based SACs, apart from the SAC with Mn located at the carbon vacancy, all the SACs can act as outstanding HER catalysts. According to the ΔGH*, these excellent V2C2- and V3C3-based SACs are comparable to the best-known Pt-based HER catalysts. However, it should be noted that the V2C2 and V3C3 slabs have not been successfully synthesized in the laboratory, leading to a pure investigation without practical application in this work.

Abstract The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO 3 RR) holds significance in both NH 3 synthesis and nitrate contamination remediation. However, achieving industrial‐scale current and high stability in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer remains challenging due to inherent high full‐cell voltage for sluggish NO 3 RR and water oxidation. Here, Cu 2 NCN with positive surface electrostatic potential V S (r) is applied as highly efficient NO 3 RR electrocatalysts to achieve industrial‐current and low‐voltage stable NH 3 production in MEA electrolyzer with coupled anodic glycerol oxidation. This paired electro‐refinery (PER) system reaches 4000 mA cm −2 at 2.52 V and remains stable at industrial‐level 1000 mA cm −2 for 100 h with the NH 3 production rate of 97000 µg NH3 h −1 cm −2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 83%. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the asymmetric and electron‐withdrawing [N−C≡N] units enhance polarization and V S (r), promoting robust and asymmetric adsorption of NO 3 * on Cu 2 NCN to facilitate O−N bond dissociation. A comprehensive techno‐economic analysis demonstrates the profitability and commercial viability of this coupled system. Our work opens a new avenue and marks a significant advancement in MEA systems for industrial NH 3 synthesis.

Abstract Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit great potential in electrocatalytic water splitting due to the unique 2D feature and an adjustable structure composed of different metal centers. In addition, LDHs have the advantage of being inherently inexpensive compared to other catalysts and have good stability in electrocatalytic water splitting. Up to now, numerous methods have been put forward to improve the activity of LDHs in electrocatalytic water splitting, a comprehensive introduction and comb to the fabrication methods and modification strategies is helpful for the followers to get a clear vein to carry out efficient manipulation to the development of high promising LDHs catalysts. In this review, the basic principles of water electrolysis, and the evaluation indexes are introduced first, and then the basic properties and commonly utilized methods in the fabrication of LDHs are introduced. After that, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting (OWS) performance of different LDHs‐based catalysts and analyze the merits and shortcomings of LDHs in electrocatalytic water splitting is compared. Based on this, the advanced strategies for improving the performance of LDHs is introduced and give a brief prospect for the development of LDHs‐based materials in electrocatalysis.

Abstract Developing efficient electrocatalysts that improve the rate‐determining step (RDS) kinetics is crucial to addressing the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study introduces ruthenium (Ru)‐cobalt(II) hydroxide (Co(OH)₂) electrocatalysts for high‐performance OER by combining compositional and thermodynamic surface engineering. Density functional theory (DFT) is employed to identify the ideal composition, with experimental validation conducted through electrodeposition, enabling facile control over a wide range of compositions for nanowire catalyst synthesis. Pourbaix diagram analysis helps establish precise synthesis conditions for developing surface nanostructures. The optimized Ru‐Co(OH)₂ catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving overpotentials of 189 mV at 10 mA cm⁻ 2 and 292 mV at 50 mA cm⁻ 2 , significantly outperforming other compositions. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to two key factors: strengthened OH adsorption energy due to optimal composition, which lowers the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step in the OER, and increased specific surface area resulting from surface nanostructure formation.

Abstract New anodic electrocatalysts with high performance and cost‐effectiveness at large current densities help advance the emerging anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) technology. To this end, a ruthenium (Ru) single atoms and sulfur (S) anions dual‐doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Ru‐S‐NiFe LDH) catalyst is reported with remarkably low alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials, high mass activities and prolonged stabilities at high current densities. Inspiringly, the AEMWE performance on Ru‐S‐NiFe LDH is also superior to the NiFe LDH. In‐depth mechanism investigations reveal that Ru single atoms not only act as the highly active sites, but also facilitate the conductivity of NiFe LDH. Meanwhile, S anions accelerate the electrochemical reconstruction of NiFe LDH to OER‐active NiFeOOH and alleviate the over‐oxidation issue on Ru active sites. Benefiting from these, Ru‐S‐NiFe LDH shows significantly enhanced OER activity and stability. Theoretical calculations further validate the decreased OER free energy difference brought about by the Ru single atoms and S anions dual‐doping. This study offers a proof‐of‐concept that the noble metal single atoms and anions dual‐doping is a feasible strategy to construct the promising 3 d transition metal‐based electrocatalysts toward the practical alkaline water electrolyzer.

High-entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles are rising as promising catalysts but face challenges in both facile synthesis and correlation of the structure with properties. Herein, utilizing the highly reductive carbon-centered isopropyl alcohol radicals generated by UV irradiation, we report a simple yet robust wet chemical method to synthesize HEA nanoparticles under ambient conditions. These isopropanol radicals verified by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy impose very large overpotentials to reduce diverse metal ions into HEA nanoparticles with five to seven different elements. Specially, the PtPdIrRhAuAgCu HEA nanoparticles on a reduced electrochemical graphene oxide (rEGO) support (PtPdIrRhAuAgCu-rEGO) demonstrate superior activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) across the entire pH range, with very small overpotentials of 11, 30, and 31 mV to deliver a current density of -10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH, 1 M phosphate buffer saline, and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The excellent HER performance of PtPdIrRhAuAgCu-rEGO surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and most contemporary HER catalysts in the literature. Density functional theory calculations using random structures mimicking the chemical disordering in PtPdIrRhAuAgCu HEA confirm its superior HER activity and imply a possible correlation between HER activity and d-band centers of the nearest atoms in a face-centered cubic hollow site.

Heteroatom-doped Fe-N-C catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives to noble metals for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their lower cost. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for their enhanced performance, particularly electrochemical stability, remain a subject of debate. This study leverages density functional theory calculations coupled with a constant potential and implicit solvent model to investigate the electrochemical stabilities and activities of pyridinic (PD-) and pyrrolic FeN4C (PL-FeN4C) catalysts. Our findings reveal that the hydrogenation susceptibility of coordinating nitrogen atoms is a critical determinant of electrochemical stability within FeN4C catalysts. Moreover, we demonstrate that oxygen and sulfur doping exerts similar effects on enhancing the overall ORR performance of PD-FeN4C catalysts: (1) by reducing the p-band center of the coordinating nitrogen, thereby improving their resistance to hydrogenation, and (2) by increasing the valence electrons of iron, leading to stronger adsorption of reaction intermediates and consequently enhanced ORR activity. Finally, our predictions suggest that O/S-doped PL-FeN4C catalysts could achieve significantly improved electrochemical stability and superior ORR performance in both acidic and alkaline environments. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of microenvironment engineering in single-atom catalysts (SACs) and offer valuable guidelines for the development of unprecedented M-N-C catalysts.

Imidazolium-based ionic liquids have led to enhanced CO2 electroreduction activity due to cation effects at the cathode surface, stabilizing the reaction intermediates and decreasing the activation energy. In aqueous media, alkali cations are also known to improve CO2 reduction activity on metals such as Ag, with the enhancement attributed to electrical double layer effects and trending with the size of the alkali cation. However, the effect of a mixed catholyte solution of alkali cations in the presence of an imidazolium-based ionic liquid has not been well-explored. Herein, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [EMIM][BF4], in water was investigated with alkali salts to unravel the interaction effects for CO2 electroreduction on Ag. Although both [EMIM]+ and alkali cations have individually improved CO2 to CO conversion on Ag in water, electrochemical results showed that alkali cations hindered imidazolium-mediated CO2 electroreduction in most conditions. Li+, in particular, was sharply inhibitory compared to other alkali cations and strongly redirected the selectivity to hydrogen evolution. The nature of the alkali cation inhibition was investigated with spectroscopic techniques, including in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS). Along with computational insights from density functional theory (DFT), the electrochemical and spectroscopic data suggest that alkali cations inhibit [EMIM]-mediated CO2 reduction by competing for surface adsorption sites, preventing the potential-dependent structural reorientation of imidazolium, and promoting hydrogen evolution by bringing solvated water to the cathode surface.

Through first-principles structure search calculations, we have identified ten hitherto unknown two-dimensional (2D) Janus-wrinkled TMTe monolayers (TM = Ni, Pd, Pt, Co, Rh, Ir, Fe, Ru, Os, and Hf) by screening 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal atoms. These monolayers exhibit high stability and metallic conductivity. Among the discovered materials, the 2D PdTe (ηOER/ORR = 0.46/0.22 V) and PtTe (ηOER/ORR = 0.46/0.32 V) monolayers can demonstrate superior bifunctional catalytic performance for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (OER/ORR), with lower overpotential than the state-of-the-art IrO2 for OER and Pt (111) for ORR, respectively. The TM- and Te-sides originating from the unique Janus configurations play a crucial role in the high OER and ORR catalytic activities, respectively. Furthermore, by stacking the monolayer structures, eight new (TMTe)2 bilayers with high stability and metallic conductivity can be achieved, which possess an internal metal layer, forming a rich electron pool. This effectively improves oxygen adsorption and activity on some bilayers, including (PdTe)2, (PtTe)2, (RhTe)2, and (IrTe)2, by transferring more electrons to the adsorbed O2 molecule, leading to considerably high ORR catalytic performance (ηORR = 0.16–0.44 V). Moreover, detailed analyses of the catalytic mechanisms have been conducted. These intriguing findings can offer new insights for designing low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts for OER and ORR reactions, with the potential to replace related noble metal catalysts used in water splitting, fuel cells, metal-air batteries, etc.

The acidic electroreduction of CO2 into multicarbon (C2+) products is much attractive for the improved carbon utilization than alkaline or neutral electroreduction. How to improve the efficiency of C2+ products generation by acidic electroreduction of CO2, is important, especially at high current density and in electrolyte with low K+ concentration. Herein, we propose a strategy of capping Cu surface with a polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) adlayer for boosting the acidic electrocatalytic CO2 conversion to C2+ products at high current densities (ampere-level) and low K+ concentration. In the electrolyte with a relatively low K+ concentration (1.0 M), the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products reaches 82.2% under a current density 1.0 A·cm−2 in acidic environment (pH=1.8). Particularly, when the current density is as high as 1.5 A·cm−2, the C2+ FE still keeps 75.8%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the presence of PIL adlayer on Cu catalyst can well inhibit H+ diffusion to catalyst surface, enrich more K+ and facilitate C-C coupling reaction. Acidic electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is a promising way for CO2 utilization, of which the selectivity and activity need improvement. Here, the authors report polymeric ionic liquid can boost the acidic electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into multicarbon products on Cu at ampere level current density.

The concept of precatalyst is widely accepted in electrochemical water splitting, but the role of precatalyst activation and the resulted changes of electrolyte composition is often overlooked. Here, we elucidate the impact of potential-dependent changes for both precatalyst and electrolyte using Co2Mo3O8 as a model system. Potential-dependent reconstruction of Co2Mo3O8 precatalyst results in an electrochemically stable Co(OH)2@Co2Mo3O8 catalyst and additional Mo dissolved as MoO42− into electrolyte. The Co(OH)2/Co2Mo3O8 interface accelerates the Volmer reaction and negative potentials induced Mo2O72− (from MoO42−) further enhances proton adsorption and H2 desorption. Leveraging these insights, the well-designed MoO42−/Mo2O72− modified Co(OH)2@Co2Mo3O8 catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 99.9% and a yield of 1.85 mol h−1 at −0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for hydrogen generation. Moreover, it maintains stable over one month at approximately 100 mA cm−2, highlighting its industrial suitability. This work underscores the significance of understanding on precatalyst reconstruction and electrolyte evolution in catalyst design. The significance of precatalyst activation and its impact on electrolyte properties in water electrocatalysis is crucial but often overlooked. The authors report an efficient transition metal catalyst for hydrogen production by manipulating both precatalyst reconstruction and electrolyte composition.

Abstract We introduce the MORE-Q dataset, a quantum-mechanical (QM) dataset encompassing the structural and electronic data of non-covalent molecular sensors formed by combining 18 mucin-derived olfactorial receptors with 102 body odor volatilome (BOV) molecules. To have a better understanding of their intra- and inter-molecular interactions, we have performed accurate QM calculations in different stages of the sensor design and, accordingly, MORE-Q splits into three subsets: i) MORE-Q-G1: QM data of 18 receptors and 102 BOV molecules, ii) MORE-Q-G2: QM data of 23,838 BOV-receptor configurations, and iii) MORE-Q-G3: QM data of 1,836 BOV-receptor-graphene systems. Each subset involves geometries optimized using GFN2-xTB with D4 dispersion correction and up to 39 physicochemical properties, including global and local properties as well as binding features, all computed at the tightly converged PBE+D3 level of theory. By addressing BOV-receptor-graphene systems from a QM perspective, MORE-Q can serve as a benchmark dataset for state-of-the-art machine learning methods developed to predict binding features. This, in turn, can provide valuable insights for developing the next-generation mucin-derived olfactory receptor sensing devices.

Lattice dynamics (LD) plays a crucial role in investigating thermal transport in terms of not only underlying physics but also novel properties and phenomena. Recently, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools in computational physics and chemistry, showing great potential in providing reliable predictions of thermal transport properties with high efficiency. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guideline for MLIPs’ development and how they are used for the computational modeling of thermal transport. Using atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as the paradigmatic potential, we introduce the essential fundamentals of MLIPs, including data construction, model training, and hyperparameter optimization. With the developed ACE potentials, we further showcase their applications in the LD modeling of thermal transport for crystalline silicon and amorphous carbon. The corresponding code implementations for MLIP applications in calculating thermal conductivity are also provided for beginners to follow.

Ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts have demonstrated promising utilization potentiality to replace the much expensive iridium (Ir)-based ones for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) due to their high electrochemical activity and low cost. However, the susceptibility of RuO2-based materials to easily be oxidized to high-valent and soluble Ru species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media hinders the practical application, especially under current density above 500 mA cm–2. Here, a manganese-doped RuO2 catalyst with the hydroxylated metal sites (i.e., H–Mn0.1Ru0.9O2) is synthesized for acidic OER assisted by hydrogen peroxide, where the hydroxylation results in the valence state of the Ru sites below +4. The H–Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 169 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and promising stability for an OER over 1000 h in an acidic electrolyte. A PEMWE device fabricated with the H–Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 catalyst as the anode shows a current density of 1 A cm–2 at ∼1.65 V, along with a low degradation over continuous tens of hours. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) results and theoretical calculations confirm that H–Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 performs the OER through the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway, where the synergistic effect of hydroxylation and Mn doping in RuO2 can effectively enhance the stability of Ru sites and lattice oxygen atoms.

Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) offer a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, however, their commercial potential is hindered by sluggish proton-involved oxygen reduction reaction (P-ORR) kinetics and inadequate durability of cathode materials. Here, a novel single-atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3-δ (BCF) perovskite, synthesized by a facile and scalable solid-state approach, as a potential cathode for PCFCs is reported. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the single-atom Ru on BCF, characterized by a unique 4-coordinate Ru-O-Fe configuration, not only induces reverse hydrogen spillover but also acts as an active site for P-ORR. The application of the optimized 2Ru-BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode in a single cell delivers an exceptional peak power density of 1.78 W cm-2 at 700 °C, along with excellent operational stability over 200 h. These findings provide new insights into single-atom engineering, advancing the commercial viability of PCFCs.
