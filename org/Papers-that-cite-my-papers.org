In this study, the electrocatalytic properties of single-phase face-centered cubic high entropy alloy electrodes with equiatomic compositions of CoNiFeCr, CoNiFeV, and CoNiFe(Cr/V) are explored for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1M KOH and 0.5M H2SO4. Among these, the CoNiFe(Cr/V) High Entropy Alloy (HEA) electrodes exhibited superior performance, achieving overpotentials of 277 and 45 mV (vs reference hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline and acidic media, respectively, surpassing their counterparts and approaching the efficiency of commercial Raney-Ni and Pt/C catalysts. Long-term stability tests, including steady state chronoamperometry and potentiodynamic cyclic voltammetry, revealed remarkable corrosion resistance in both environments. The catalytic activity was significantly enhanced by the inclusion of Cr and V. These oxyphilic elements, with their larger atomic radii, induce a heterogeneous surface charge distribution that enhances the electrocatalytic performance of the CoNiFe(Cr/V) HEA. This work highlights a promising candidate for HER applications and sets the stage for a broader exploration of high entropy alloys in advanced catalytic systems.

Abstract The energy crisis driven by the widespread use of fossil fuels highlights the urgent need for green energy solutions. A variety of green electric generators based on interfacial ion regulation have emerged in recent years. However, conventional electricity generation methods that rely solely on ion movement at interfaces suffer from a rapid decline in electrical signals due to poor ion‐electron conversion at the interface. Inspired by the bioelectrical phenomena based on the variations in membrane potential and the glucose oxidation/reduction reactions, a redox oscillation enhanced water‐enabled electric generator is herein proposed. The oscillating redox process not only boosts the ion‐electron conversion at the interface but also enables the synergy between the non‐Faraday current and the Faraday current. As a result, the generator achieves an impressive peak electric output of 1.20 mA cm −2 and 0.41 W m −2 for 60 days, outperforming various water‐enabled electric generators. Furthermore, this generator can be integrated into a flexible unit for both portable and large‐scale applications. This work presents a novel approach for enhancing the output of green energy devices based on interfacial ion migration.

Abstract Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO 3 RR) is an attractive green route to generate valuable ammonia and remove nitrates in industrial processes. However, under the intense competition of hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), it is a key challenge to improve the selectivity and reduce the energy consumption of the nitrate reduction reaction. Herein, a unique amorphous RuCo Bimetallenes confined on Ti 3 C 2 T x ‐MXene (RuCo/Ti 3 C 2 T x ) is reported as a highly efficient NO 3 RR catalyst, showing a remarkable Faradaic efficiency for ammonia of 94.7% at −0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), with the corresponding high ammonia yield rate of 98.8 mg h −1 mg cat −1 at −0.6 V versus RHE. Significantly, the RuCo/Ti 3 C 2 T x heterostructures are able to operate stably at 1 A cm −2 for over 100 h under membrane electrode assembly (MEA) conditions with a stabilized NH 3 Faraday efficiency. In‐depth theoretical and operando spectroscopic investigations unveil that the in situ generation of heterojunction via interfacial Ru/Co─O bridges can induce charge redistribution through Ru/Co─O‐Ti structure and modulate the electronic structure of RuCo Bimetallenes, significantly promoting * H production and the adsorption and activation of reactants/intermediates, while suppressing HER, thereby boosting NO 3 RR performance. This study offers a new insight the metal‐support interaction for the development of high‐performance electrocatalysts.

Abstract Platinum (Pt) metallenes, an emerging class of ultrathin 2D nanomaterials, have redefined the field of electrocatalysis, offering physicochemical properties that are completely new to conventional catalyst materials. Characterized by their high surface‐to‐volume ratios, abundant active sites, and tunable electronic structures, Pt metallenes exhibit remarkable efficiencies across key reactions in fuel cells and electrolyzers, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and liquid fuel oxidation reaction (LFOR). Overcoming the inherent limitations of rigid Pt‐Pt bonds and the face‐centered cubic structure, recent advances in synthesis, such as bottom‐up methods and top‐down exfoliation, have enabled precise control over the atomic thickness, morphology, and composition of 2D Pt metallenes. In addition, advanced engineering strategies, such as defect creation, ligand modulation, and strain optimization, have further enhanced the intrinsic activity of the active sites and tailored the electronic structures to accelerate reaction kinetics. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest progress in Pt metallene research, emphasizing challenges in synthesis, structural design, and electrocatalytic applications. It is anticipated that the Pt metallenes, promising catalysts for sustainable energy technologies, will offer transformative solutions for efficient energy conversion and environmental remediation.

Abstract The sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the limiting cathodic reaction for the low‐temperature H 2 ‐Air fuel cell. To overcome the limitations of Pt‐based nano‐scale materials, this work explores the possibility of a simple Au–Ag alloy‐based nanosystem for enhanced fuel cell activity by exploiting their substantial electrocatalytic activity, stability, and durability toward ORR in an alkaline medium. This work further demonstrates how the ORR activity of this simple nanosystem can be further tuned by formulating an Au–Ag nanoalloy and manipulating their surface‐ligand chemistry to generate a porous aggregated network structure with enriched crystal defects. The fabricated nanoalloy network follows a 4eˉ ORR pathway with a substantially low overpotential, demonstrating the role of molecular‐level strain in enhancing its catalytic activity. The enhanced catalytic activity for the ORR mechanism is validated through first‐principles calculations by modeling the twin boundary at the Au–Ag nanoalloy junction. In the system‐level application, this catalyst shows a peak power density of 98.18 mW cm −2 at a current density of 443.7 mA cm −2 in a single‐cell H 2 ‐air fuel cell, comparable with a commercial Pt/C catalyst and even shows better performance at higher current density due to which it can serve as potential cathode catalyst in fuel cell devices.

Abstract The development of cost‐effective noble‐metal‐free cocatalysts with exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is critical for advancing scalable and sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen production. Although platinum (Pt) remains a benchmark HER catalyst, its scarcity and high cost stimulates the search for viable alternatives. In this work, a machine learning (ML)‐accelerated strategy is presented to screen highly active ternary CrNiCu alloys. Combining with density functional theory calculations, XGBoost regression models were trained to predict hydrogen adsorption energies and water dissociation energy barriers on CrNiCu alloy surfaces. Consequently, the theoretical exchange current densities were predicted for all possible compositions of CrNiCu alloys, enabling the identification of alloy catalysts with composition of 10∼30 at.% Cr, 30–50 at.% Ni, and 20–60 at.% Cu that exhibits superior HER activity than Pt. Stability assessment of optimal ternary CrNiCu alloys further confirms their excellent resistance to element segregation and hydroxyl poisoning under operational conditions. This work not only identifies promising ternary CrNiCu alloys of non‐noble HER catalysts but also establishes an efficient ML‐accelerated computational framework for the discovery of durable high‐activity alloys for renewable energy applications.

Abstract Turning non-precious metals into efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) presents both fundamental challenges and significant technological implications. Metal nanoclusters (MNCs) exhibit considerable potential to achieve this objective due to their quantum size effects and low-coordination environments. In this study, we comprehensively investigate the size and doping effects of silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) clusters using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). Our findings indicate that the adsorption free energies of hydrogen on both Cu and Ag clusters are enhanced compared to their periodic surface counterparts, leading to significantly improved HER performance. Specifically, for Cu clusters, Cu55 demonstrates the best HER performance with a hydrogen free energy (ΔGH) of only − 0.02 eV at hollow sites. In contrast, Ag13 exhibits the best HER performance among Ag clusters, with a ΔGH of -0.04 eV at bridge sites. The incorporation of nickel (Ni) and platinum (Pt) weakend the hydrogen adsorption energy of the Cu13 cluster, resulting in improved HER performance for Cu13. Partial density of states (PDOS) analysis reveals that as we transition from bulk materials to clusters, the density of states around the Fermi energy increases due to quantum confinement effects, thereby enhancing hydrogen binding ability. Also, the doping of Ni and Pt in Ag and Cu cluster can shift the position of d-band center effectively and tune the hydrogen binding ability. Furthermore, Bader charge analysis indicates that charge accumulation on the Pt and Ni-doped clusters increases with cluster size. This research provides valuable insights into optimizing catalytic activity for hydrogen adsorption across different cluster sizes, as well as in Ni and Pt-doped Cu and Ag nanoclusters in the context of HER.

Citation metrics influence academic reputation and career trajectories. Recent works have highlighted flaws in citation practices in the Neurosciences, such as the under-citation of women. However, self-citation rates—or how much authors cite themselves—have not yet been comprehensively investigated in the Neurosciences. This work characterizes self-citation rates in basic, translational, and clinical Neuroscience literature by collating 100,347 articles from 63 journals between the years 2000–2020. In analyzing over five million citations, we demonstrate four key findings: (1) increasing self-citation rates of Last Authors relative to First Authors, (2) lower self-citation rates in low- and middle-income countries, (3) gender differences in self-citation stemming from differences in the number of previously published papers, and (4) variations in self-citation rates by field. Our characterization of self-citation provides insight into citation practices that shape the perceived influence of authors in the Neurosciences, which in turn may impact what type of scientific research is done and who gets the opportunity to do it.

Harnessing intrinsic properties to modulate the electronic structure of two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for clean energy conversion, but challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning intrinsic dipole is an effective strategy to enhance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of 2D Janus MXenes, which is exemplified by Mo2C_XY (X/Y = O, F, S, H, OH), using density functional theory calculations. Particularly, Mo2C_OF exhibits four intrinsic dipoles (μS↑, μM↑, μL↑, and μ↓), each characterized by distinct magnitudes and/or directions originated from the Mo3+ displacement and its phase change. We propose a single-atom dipole moment to elucidate the underlying mechanism controlling the variation of intrinsic dipole moments in Janus monolayer MXenes. It is found that intrinsic dipole significantly influences the HER activity. Specifically, the adsorption energy of H is reduced when the dipole direction points toward the adsorbed intermediate. Among them, Mo2C_OOH has the Gibbs free energy of −0.04 eV, surpassing the catalytic performance of commercial Pt. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intrinsic dipoles can be tuned via external strain or electronic doping, providing a pathway for optimizing catalytic performance.

ABSTRACT This study presents an automated framework for discovering Diarylethene derivatives with specific HOMO‐LUMO bandgaps by integrating first‐principles calculations with evolutionary optimization algorithms. We develop a protocol for performing automatic, parallel Density Functional Theory calculations using Turbomole, enabled by the Atomic Simulation Environment Python wrapper. This integration allows for fully autonomous evolutionary searches, removing the need for human intervention. To evaluate our platform, we conduct searches within the chemical space of Diarylethene using two optimization strategies: A “local” strategy, which explores local neighborhoods, and a “glocal” strategy, which combines local exploration with memory of past achievements.

Abstract Designing high‐performance catalysts based on supported metal atoms and nanoparticles necessitates rigorous assembly control, which affects reactivity. Yet, attaining synthesis precision to discern catalyst speciation and properties remains challenging. This limitation is tackled by pioneering an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology that combines a decision tree classifier and a random forest regressor sequentially to elucidate synthesis‐structure‐property‐function relationships in nanostructured catalysts, exemplified for the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. The decision tree accurately predicts the formation of single atoms versus nanoparticles for 37 metals anchored on nitrogen‐doped carbon, identifying the metal's standard reduction potential and cohesive energy as determinants of speciation. The random forest regressor correlates the electrocatalytic performance of synthesized single‐atom catalysts (SACs) to intrinsic properties, revealing a volcano‐like relationship of current density with the electronegativity of the active site and metal‐support interaction, providing insights beyond traditional adsorption energy descriptors. The integrated models are validated experimentally with an overall accuracy of over 80%, establishing user confidence. This XAI framework, adaptable to diverse synthetic protocols and material classes is a powerful tool to understand synthesis‐structure‐property‐function relationships and promote data‐informed experiments with reduced characterization efforts.

Abstract High‐loaded Pt intermetallic compounds (IMCs) present the practical application potential in low‐Pt PEM fuel cells while ordering transformation under high temperature inevitably leads to severe sintering of high‐density IMC nanoparticles (NPs), thus the decayed oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Herein, an entropy‐increase assisted anti‐sintering concept is proposed to fundamentally reduce the surface energy of NPs by increasing the mixing entropy, thus hindering the migration and coalescence of NPs. Ex/in situ electron microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) corroborate that the higher the entropy of pristine NPs, the lower the surface energy, the smaller the average size, and the more uniform distribution after annealing. The prepared Pt high‐entropy IMC (Pt‐HEI@Pt/C) demonstrates high metal loading (40.53 wt.%) and small particle size (≈3.15 nm), which endow it with an excellent ORR activity with mass activity (MA@0.9V, 0.65 A mg −1 Pt ) and durability over 20k potential‐cycling. Membrane electrode assembly integrated with this catalyst delivers a peak power density of 0.96 W cm −2 and an exceptional stability (12.5% decline in MA) under H2‐air condition at 0.1 mg Pt cm −2 . DFT reveals the reinforced strain regulation effect of the HEI core on the Pt shell, which optimizes the *OOH adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of Pt dissolution, thus simultaneously enhancing the intrinsic ORR activity and durability.

Tuning the surface strain is a powerful strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of metal nanocatalysts, yet an atomically precise catalyst with intramolecular strain to unlock the atomic-level strain-structure-activity relationship is still highly desired. Herein, we report the synthesis, structural anatomy, and catalytic performance toward cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis of an atomically precise Ag16Cu18(C≡C-C6H11)24 (Ag16Cu18) nanocluster, which has a Cu6 ring in the center. The Cu-Cu distance in the Cu6 ring is only 1.616 Å in a single crystal, the shortest Cu-Cu bond in Cu nanomaterials to date. Furthermore, once Ag16Cu18 was loaded onto carbon paper, the ultrashort Cu-Cu bond elongated to ∼2.40 Å, still showing strong intramolecular compressive strain. Ag16Cu18 exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward oxime electrosynthesis, manifested by a maximal Faradaic efficiency, yield, and yield rate of cyclohexanone oxime reaching 47.4%, 95.4%, and 2.66 mmol·h-1·cm-2 at -0.35 V, respectively. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy revealed that the Cu sites adjacent to the Ag atoms primarily reduce NO and stabilize it at the *NH2OH stage, while the Cu sites with compressive strain provide H* for NO reduction and adsorb cyclohexanone to react with *NH2OH, forming cyclohexanone oxime simultaneously. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the presence of compressive strain in the Cu6 ring, which facilitates H* formation and cyclohexanone adsorption, hence significantly contributing to oxime generation. This study not only reports a case of atomically precise clusters with intramolecular compressive strain but also provides an atomic-level understanding for employing bimetallic nanocluster-based catalysts toward the electrosynthesis of valuable organic molecules.

TrIP2 is an advanced version of the transformer interatomic potential (TrIP) trained on the expanded ANI-2x data set, including more diverse molecular configurations with sulfur, fluorine, and chlorine. It leverages the equivariant SE(3)-transformer architecture, incorporating physical biases and continuous atomic representations. TrIP was introduced as a highly promising transferable interatomic potential, which we show here to generalize to new atom types with no alterations to the underlying model design. Benchmarking on COMP6 energy and force calculations, structure minimization tasks, torsion drives, and applications to molecules with unexpected conformational energy minima demonstrates TrIP2's high accuracy and transferability. Direct architectural comparisons demonstrate superior performance against ANI-2x, while holistic model evaluations─including training data and level-of-theory considerations─show comparative performance with state-of-the-art models like AIMNet2 and MACE-OFF23. Notably, TrIP2 achieves state-of-the-art force prediction performance on the COMP6 benchmarks and closely approaches DFT-optimized structures in torsion drives and geometry optimization tasks. Without requiring any architectural modifications, TrIP2 successfully capitalizes on additional training data to deliver enhanced generalizability and precision, establishing itself as a robust and scalable framework capable of accommodating future expansions or applications to new domains with minimal reengineering.

As predicted by the Hume-Rothery rules, forming solid solutions of rutile IrO2 with other metal oxides that have different crystal structures is thermodynamically challenging. Consequently, achieving high solubility of foreign elements in Ir-based solid-solution oxides has been significantly limited. We demonstrate that hexagonal-perovskite BaIrO3 can serve as a flexible matrix oxide capable of incorporating a wide spectrum of (post)transition-metal cations with different electronic structures, ranging from d0 to d10 configurations. Among 12 cation solutes, Ta5+, Nb5+, and Zr4+ are found to be stable without substantial leaching during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic condition. Acceptor-type trivalent cations, including Sc3+, In3+, and Fe3+, are identified to leach out gradually from the particle surface while enhancing the OER catalytic activity. Both X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently show that the robust face-sharing [IrO6] octahedral framework of the solid solutions remains unperturbed unless electrochemical leaching rapidly occurs. As a result, notably high S-numbers, on the order of 106, are achievable at pH = 1. Although our work focuses on single-element incorporation, it is suggested that the solid-solution methodology is an effective strategy for developing stable, long-lasting OER catalysts with further reduced Ir usage for acidic water oxidation.

Hydrogen is a key energy carrier, playing a vital role in sustainable energy systems. This review provides a comparative analysis of physical, chemical, and innovative hydrogen storage methods from technical, environmental, and economic perspectives. It has been identified that compressed and liquefied hydrogen are predominantly utilized in transportation applications, while chemical transport is mainly supported by liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) and ammonia-based systems. Although metal hydrides and nanomaterials offer high hydrogen storage capacities, they face limitations related to cost and thermal management. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI)- and machine learning (ML)-based optimization techniques are highlighted for their potential to enhance energy efficiency and improve system performance. In conclusion, for hydrogen storage systems to achieve broader applicability, it is recommended that integrated approaches be adopted—focusing on innovative material development, economic feasibility, and environmental sustainability.
