This study explores the synthesis and characterization of platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co)-based electrocatalysts using the sol–gel method. The focus is on the effect of different support materials on the catalytic performance in alkaline media. The sol–gel technique enables the production of highly uniform electrocatalysts, supported on carbon-based substrates, metal oxides, and conductive polymers. Various characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were used to analyze the structure of the synthesized materials, while their electrochemical properties, which are relevant to their application in unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs), were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). This hydrogen energy-converting device integrates water electrolyzers and fuel cells into a single system, reducing weight, volume, and cost. However, their performance is constrained by the electrocatalyst’s oxygen bifunctional activity. To improve URFC efficiency, an ideal electrocatalyst should exhibit high oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) activity with a low bifunctionality index (BI). The present study evaluated the prepared electrocatalysts in an alkaline medium, finding that Pt25-Co75/XC72R and Pt75-Co25/N82 demonstrated promising bifunctional activity. The results suggest that these electrocatalysts are well-suited for both electrolysis and fuel cell operation in anion exchange membrane-unitized regenerative fuel cells (AEM-URFCs), contributing to improved round-trip efficiency.

ABSTRACT By the random distribution of metals in a single phase, entropy engineering is applied to construct dense neighboring active centers with diverse electronic and geometric structures, realizing the continuous optimization of multiple primary reactions for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Many catalysts developed through entropy engineering have been built in nearly equimolar ratios to pursue high entropy, hindering the identification of the active sites and potentially diluting the concentration of real active sites while weakening their electronic interactions with reaction intermediates. Herein, this work proposes an entropy‐engineering strategy in metal nanoparticle‐embedded nitrogen carbon electrocatalysts, implemented by entropy‐engineered Prussian blue analogs (PBA) as precursors to enhance the catalytic activity of primary Cu‐Fe active sites. Through the introduction of the micro‐strains driven by entropy engineering, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and geometric phase analysis (GPA) using Lorentz electron microscopy further elucidate the optimization of the adsorption/desorption of intermediates. Furthermore, the multi‐dimensional morphology and the size diminishment of the nanocrystals serve to expand the electrochemical area, maximizing the catalytic activity for both ORR and OER. Notably, the Zn‐air battery assembled with CuFeCoNiZn‐NC operated for over 1300 h with negligible decay. This work presents a paradigm for the design of low‐cost electrocatalysts with entropy engineering for multi‐step reactions.

Pt-based alloys with precisely controllable element distribution are highly sought after in catalysis. This study focuses on optimizing elemental distribution and alloying in PtNi alloy nanowires (NWs) through high-temperature heat treatment. The resulting PtNi alloy NWs with uniform elemental distribution (U-PtNi NWs) demonstrate exceptional stability, attributed to facilitated electron transfer and a denser Pt shell, in stark contrast to untreated NWs that suffer from elemental segregation and subsequent performance degradation during electrochemical testing. In methanol oxidation reaction tests, U-PtNi NWs demonstrated exceptional mass activity (1562.0 mA mg–1) and specific activity (5.38 mA cm–2), with minimal activity loss after 1000 cycles. This work emphasizes the significance of precise component control in developing high-performance catalysts and presents a strategy to enhance fuel cell performance through one-dimensional nanocomponent adjustment.

Renewable biomass serves as a cost-effective source of carbon matrix to carry single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, the natural abundant oxygen in these materials hinders the sufficient dispersion of element with high oxygen affinity such iron (Fe). The lowered-density and oxidized SACs greatly limits their catalytic applications. Here we develop a facile continuous activation (CA) approach for synthesizing robust biomass-derived Fe-SACs. Comparing to the traditional pyrolysis method, the CA approach significantly increases the Fe loading density from 1.13 atoms nm−2 to 4.70 atoms nm−2. Simultaneously, the CA approach induces a distinct coordination tuning from dominated Fe-O to Fe-N moieties. We observe a pH-universal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance over the CA-derived Fe-SACs with a half-wave potential of 0.93 V and 0.78 V vs. RHE in alkaline and acidic electrolyte, respectively. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the increased Fe-N coordination effectively reduces the energy barriers for the ORR, thus enhancing the catalytic activity. The Fe-SACs-based zinc-air batteries show a specific capacity of 792 mA·h·gZn−1 and ultra-long life span of over 650 h at 5 mA cm−2. Developing efficient single-atom catalysts for clean energy technologies is still challenging. Here, the authors report a facile method to increase the density and tune the coordination of iron atom loaded in single-atom catalysts that boosts the activity for pH-universal oxygen electrolysis.

Identifying efficient and physically meaningful descriptors is crucial for the rational design of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. In this study, we systematically investigate the HER activity of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning techniques. By exploring the relationship between key electronic properties, including the conduction band minimum (CBM), pz band center, and hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG*H), we establish a strong linear correlation between the CBM and ΔG*H, identifying the CBM as a reliable and physically meaningful descriptor for HER activity. Furthermore, this correlation is validated in vacancy-defected TMD systems, demonstrating that the CBM remains an effective descriptor even in the presence of structural defects. To enable the rapid and accurate prediction of the CBM, we develop an interpretable three-dimensional model using the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) algorithm. The SISSO model achieves a high predictive accuracy, with correlation coefficients (r) and coefficients of determination (R2) reaching 0.98 and 0.97 in the training and 0.99 and 0.99 in the validation tests, respectively. This study provides an efficient computational framework that combines first-principles calculations and machine learning to accelerate the screening and design of high-performance TMD-based HER catalysts.

This is a review of theoretical and methodological development over the past decade pertaining to computational characterization of thermoelectric materials from first principles. Primary focus is on electronic and thermal transport in solids. Particular attention is given to the relationships between the various methods in terms of the theoretical hierarchy as well as the tradeoff of physical accuracy and computational efficiency of each. Further covered are up-and-coming methods for modeling defect formation and dopability, keys to realizing a material's thermoelectric potential. We present and discuss all these methods in close connection with parallel developments in high-throughput infrastructure and code implementation that enable large-scale computing and materials screening. In all, it is demonstrated that advances in computational tools are now ripe for efficient and accurate targeting of the needles in the haystack, which are “next-generation” thermoelectric materials.

The quantitative evaluation of the carbon hybridization state by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been a surface-analysis problem for the last three decades due to the challenges associated with the unambiguous identification of the characteristic binding energy values for sp2- and sp3-bonded carbon. Here, we computed the binding energy values of C(1s) core electrons on the absolute energy scale for model structures of amorphous carbon (a-C) using density functional theory (DFT). The DFT calculations show that in the case of hydrogen-free a-C, the C(1s) binding energy for sp3 carbon atoms is a distribution found approximately 1 eV higher than the binding energy distribution of sp2-hybridized carbons. However, the introduction of hydrogen in the a-C network reduces the distance between the characteristic signals of sp3- and sp2-bonded carbon due to the increased ability to screen the core hole by neighboring hydrogen atoms as compared to carbon atoms. This effect hinders the unambiguous quantification of the carbon hybridization state on the basis of C(1s) XPS data alone. This work can assist surface scientists in the use of XPS for the accurate characterization of carbon-based materials. Published by the American Physical Society 2025

Abstract Photoreforming of polylactic acid (PLA) waste into valuable chemicals offers a promising approach for environmental protection and waste valorization, yet faces challenges of low yields and harsh conditions. Herein, a Cd 0.5 Zn 0.5 S nanotwin catalyst decorated with Ru single atoms and clusters is reported, enabling selective photoreforming of PLA into pyruvic acid (PA) and H 2 . It is demonstrated that Ru single atoms favor PA formation via hydroxyl dissociation, while the further incorporation of Ru clusters serve as active sites for H 2 production. This synergistic effect significantly enhances photocatalytic performance, achieving 96.8% PA selectivity and efficient H 2 production with a record‐breaking apparent quantum efficiency of 83.7% at 400 nm. This approach is scalable for outdoor processes, utilizing direct 1 m 2 sunlight irradiation to deliver ≈1191 mL h −1 of H 2 and 47.27 mmol h −1 of PA from PLA waste, paving a viable pathway for large‐scale simultaneous production of high‐value chemicals and H 2 .

Abstract Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to their 100% atomic utilization efficiency. The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to CO using SAC offers a promising approach for CO 2 utilization, but achieving facile CO 2 adsorption and CO desorption remains challenging for traditional SACs. Instead of singling out specific atoms, we propose a strategy utilizing atoms from the entire lanthanide (Ln) group to facilitate the CO 2 RR. Density functional theory calculations, operando spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate the bridging adsorption mechanism for a representative erbium (Er) single-atom catalyst. As a result, we realize a series of Ln SACs spanning 14 elements that exhibit CO Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. The Er catalyst achieves a high turnover frequency of ~130,000 h − 1 at 500 mA cm − 2 . Moreover, 34.7% full-cell energy efficiency and 70.4% single-pass CO 2 conversion efficiency are obtained at 200 mA cm − 2 with acidic electrolyte. This catalytic platform leverages the collective potential of the lanthanide group, introducing new possibilities for efficient CO 2 -to-CO conversion and beyond through the exploration of unique bonding motifs in single-atom catalysts.

Alkyl sulfonated polyimides (ASPIs), as alternative polymer electrolytes for fuel cells, are known to exhibit lyotropic liquid crystalline behavior upon water uptake, forming organized lamellar structures and achieving high proton conductivity. Previous experimental studies have shown that ASPIs with planar backbones exhibit enhanced proton conductivity (0.2 S/cm) compared to those with bent backbones (0.03 S/cm). To explain this difference at the atomistic level, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted using a universal neural network potential. The appearance of monomer unit length in planar ASPIs, indicating higher molecular order, was found to correlate with higher proton conductivity compared to that of bent ASPIs. Despite the similar deprotonation and solvation of sulfonic acid groups in both planar and bent ASPIs, the proton conductivity was independent of these factors. Directional mean square displacement analysis provided further insights into the differences in proton conductivity between planar and bent types.

Two-dimensional materials hold substantial promise for photocatalytic water splitting, primarily due to their unique structural properties and high-efficiency light absorption. However, finding such applicable materials poses a huge challenge because there are many strict requirements to meet. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to design and evaluate two monolayers, Sc2Se2X2 (X = Cl, Br), highlighting their potential as high-performance photocatalysts. these materials exhibit low activation energy barriers for water-splitting redox reactions, which facilitate high catalytic performance. The photogenerated electric field promotes oxygen adsorption, accelerating the overall reaction. The structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermodynamic stabilities of these materials are confirmed through comprehensive analyses. With band gaps of 2.65 and 2.40 eV, respectively, these materials meet the band gap requirements for photocatalytic water splitting. Furthermore, a prominent characteristic of these materials is their significantly high electron mobility along the y-axis, reaching 26,560.74 and 17,634.01 cm2 V-1 s-1, which far surpasses the hole mobility. This characteristic effectively reduces electron-hole recombination and enhances photocatalytic performance. With solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies of 13.60% and 20.58%, respectively, these materials surpass the 10% threshold required for commercial photocatalytic applications. These findings indicate that monolayer Sc2Se2X2 (X = Cl, Br) has great theoretical potential for photocatalytic water splitting.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized molecular simulation by providing efficient and accurate models for predicting atomic interactions. MLPs continue to advance and have had profound impact in applications that include drug discovery, enzyme catalysis, and materials design. The current landscape of MLP software presents challenges due to the limited interoperability between packages, which can lead to inconsistent benchmarking practices and necessitates separate interfaces with molecular dynamics (MD) software. To address these issues, we present DeePMD-GNN, a plugin for the DeePMD-kit framework that extends its capabilities to support external graph neural network (GNN) potentials.DeePMD-GNN enables the seamless integration of popular GNN-based models, such as NequIP and MACE, within the DeePMD-kit ecosystem. Furthermore, the new software infrastructure allows GNN models to be used within combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) applications using the range corrected ΔMLP formalism.We demonstrate the application of DeePMD-GNN by performing benchmark calculations of NequIP, MACE, and DPA-2 models developed under consistent training conditions to ensure fair comparison.

Abstract The dissolution and inactivation of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts remain significant barriers to the development of acidic water electrolysis. Here, the activity and stability of BaIrO 3 (BIO) perovskite are enhanced through the controlled regulation of metal‐oxygen octahedra via B‐site substitution with Co (BICO). During OER process, the dissolution of Ba and Co leads to the formation of highly active IrCoO x nanoparticles on the amorphous surface layers of BICO. The introduction of Co not only increases the concentration of high‐valence Ir species with high activity but also prevents the excessive oxidation and dissolution of Ir by taking over its oxidation role during the reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal a substantial reduction in the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (RDS) after Co doping. BICO‐2 electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional OER performance, requiring an overpotential of 216 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , while maintaining continuous operation for over 140 h without significant degradation, and boasting a stability number (S‐number) of 4.3 × 10 5 . Additionally, BICO‐2 exhibits excellent activity and durability in proton exchange membranes (PEM) water electrolysis. This work introduces a novel approach for designing and fabricating efficient, long‐lasting electrocatalysts, offering significant insights for advancing acidic water electrolysis technologies.

Although noble metals Ag and Au have similar chemical reactivities, their catalytic selectivity for NO electroreduction is significantly different. Namely, hydroxylamine is often considerably produced on Ag while not observed on the Au electrode. In this study, first-principles calculations and the electric field controlling constant potential (EFC-CP) method are adopted to unveil the underlying reasons. We first reveal a distinct NO* adsorption configuration, vertical on Ag and inclined on Au, leading to different reduction pathways to NOH* and HNO*, respectively. Via complete electrochemical barrier calculations and detailed kinetic analysis, we find the hydroxylamine selectivity difference between Ag and Au is mainly induced by adsorption strength of NH2OH*. On Ag, the obtained NH2OH* prefers to desorb and produce hydroxylamine, while NH2OH* is bonded strongly to Au and favors further reduction to ammonia. The study advances our understanding of factors regulating product selectivity, providing crucial insights for designing NO electroreduction catalysts toward hydroxylamine production.

Developing efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for the continuous activation of oxidants is crucial to mitigating the global water resource crisis. Guided by computational predictions, this research achieved this goal through the synthesis of a modified graphitic carbon nitride with enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Its intrinsic activity was further amplified by dynamic in-situ reconstruction using the I−/I3− redox mediator system during photoreactions. Impressively, this reconstructed catalyst demonstrated the capability for at least 30 regeneration cycles while maintaining high purification efficacy. The mechanism underlying the in-situ reconstruction of active sites for periodate functionalization was elucidated through theoretical calculations, coupled with semi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical analyses. The system's capacity to detoxify recalcitrant pollutants was demonstrated through successful Escherichia coli cultivation and Zebrafish embryo experiments. The economic feasibility and environmental impacts are quantitatively assessed by the Electrical Energy per Order (EE/O) metric and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), confirming the system's scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. This dual-site constrained interlayer insertion, and controllable in-situ catalyst reconstruction achieve durable robustness of the photocatalyst, paving the way for the development of sustainable catalytic water purification technologies. Efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for sustained oxidant activation are vital for solving the global water crisis but elusive. Here, the authors explore the in situ dynamic reconstruction of graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts with iodine redox mediators, to develop a solar-driven Fenton-like system that activates periodate for effective and sustainable wastewater regeneration.

Abstract The stability and electronic properties of 2‐D conducting metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) play a crucial role in their potential applications in energy‐related processes. In this study, The structural stability and electronic characteristics of M 3 (C 6 Se 6 ) (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt) are systematically investigated using first‐principles calculations. Formation energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm the excellent thermodynamic and thermal stability of these frameworks. Additionally, density of states (DOS) analysis reveals that nine of these structures exhibit high electrical conductivity, making them promising for electronic and electrocatalytic applications. To further understand their electronic structure, the d ‐band center and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) are analyzed, providing insight into the bonding characteristics and electronic interactions within the frameworks. Moreover, the catalytic performance of the conductive MOFs is evaluated as multifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This study highlights the robust stability and tunable electronic properties of M 3 (C 6 Se 6 ), serving as a foundation for future investigations into their functional applications in energy conversion and storage technologies.

Abstract The primary hurdle faced in the practical application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) involves improving the intrinsic kinetic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts while concurrently enhancing their durability. Although electrocatalysts based on lattice oxygen‐mediated mechanism (LOM) have the potential to significantly enhance the activity in OER without being restricted by scaling relationships, they are neglected in acidic electrolytes due to limited durability. In this study, an innovative approach is presented to simultaneously promote the activation of lattice oxygen and improve the durability of LOM‐based OER electrocatalysts by incorporating d 0 metal ions into the RuO 2 electrocatalyst. Leveraging the unique electronic properties of the d 0 metal ion, the O 2p band center and Ru‐O covalency of the electrocatalyst are successfully engineered, resulting in the change in OER mechanism. Furthermore, in a single cell of PEMWE, the LOM‐based electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding performance, achieving 3.0 A cm −2 at 1.81 V and maintaining durability for 100 h at 200 mA cm −2 , surpassing commercial RuO 2 . This innovative strategy challenges the traditional viewpoint that suppressing lattice oxygen activation in OER is essential for enhancing PEMWE durability, offering new perspectives for the development of OER electrocatalysts in acidic electrolytes.

Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl3 in water.

It is challenging to clarify modulation mechanisms and structure-activity relationships in the ion-regulation engineering of multinary copper chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs) for solar-to-hydrogen conversion. Herein, quaternary 2D Cu-In-Zn-S NCs are fabricated using various indium precursors to expose a high proportion of (0002) crystal facets that are positively correlated with their photocatalytic activities. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the specific adsorption of anions on the crystal facets significantly influences their anisotropic growth and, in turn, photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, 2D Cu-In-Ga-Zn-S (CIGZS) NCs are prepared by partially or completely substituting In3+ with Ga3+ cations. As the Ga3⁺ content gradually increases, the resulting photocatalytic activities follow a bell-shaped trend. The initial increase is attributed to a synergistic effect of optimized catalytic ability and a stronger electron driving force introduced by Ga3⁺ incorporation. However, excessive Ga3⁺ substitution widens the bandgap, reducing light absorption and conversion, ultimately leading to a decline in photocatalytic activities. Notably, the photocatalytic activity of Cu-Ga-Zn-S NCs with the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1566.8 µmol g-1 h-1 under visible light surpassed those of all In-based NCs due to enhanced electron-hole separation efficiency and highly effective active sites. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of multinary copper-based photocatalysts for solar-driven hydrogen production.
