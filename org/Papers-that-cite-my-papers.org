Better understanding and prediction of the electrochemical interface require large-scale atomistic simulations. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have proven to be an effective approach. However, current MLFFs typically do not account for the effect of electrode potential, which requires treating interface electrons with a grand canonical ensemble. Here, we develop a constant potential MLFF (CP-MLFF) based on an equivariant graph neural network and implement it into MACE. Specifically, we design an architecture that can take the number of electrons as the input and accurately predict the Fermi level. The CP-MLFF allows us to examine the convergency of the electrochemical barrier with respect to sampling, which we demonstrate through the example of CO2 reduction on the Ni-N-C catalyst. Our work provides a useful method and tool enabling accurate and efficient large-scale simulation of the electrochemical interface.

Amino acids are key contributors to nitrogenous emissions during biomass pyrolysis, yet the underlying reaction mechanisms governing their thermal degradation remain only partially understood. In this study, we combine systematic reaction path search algorithms with chemical insight and density functional theory (DFT) simulations to investigate the thermal decomposition of glycine (Gly), the simplest amino acid, with a focus on the formation of ammonia (NH3), a major precursor of environmentally harmful NOx species. We derive a comprehensive reaction network for the thermal decomposition of Gly. Notably, we show that, at variance with water (H2O) that can be generated via simple dimerization in the gas phase, NH3 evolution is kinetically unfavorable at moderate temperatures and low-pressure conditions, while it can proceed with much smaller barriers in the condensed phase via many-body mechanisms involving ionic-pair proton-exchange-driven polymerization pathways. Under such conditions, we predict that NH3 evolution competes with H2O formation, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal to sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies. Yet, its sluggish kinetics in acidic media and reliance on expensive noble metal catalysts limit its efficiency in these applications. Spinel cobalt(II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 )‐based catalysts are cost‐effective alternatives with high theoretical catalytic activity. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their poor stability in acidic electrolytes. This review critically examines recent advances in enhancing the stability of spinel Co 3 O 4 ‐based catalysts for acidic OER. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of acidic OER are first analyzed to illustrate how different catalyst design strategies can be used to improve their stability. Next, five key catalyst design strategies reported in recent studies are summarized: 1) constructing protective surface layers, 2) modulating reaction pathways, 3) controlling cobalt redox dynamics, 4) tuning cobalt‐oxygen covalency, and 5) stabilizing lattice oxygen. Further, recent research progress in understanding the structure‐activity‐stability relationship of spinel Co 3 O 4 ‐based catalysts is summarized, with a focus on identifying their catalytically active sites, tracking surface reconstruction, and elucidating degradation mechanisms. This review ends with a discussion of future research directions for addressing key challenges in realizing durable, high‐performance Co 3 O 4 ‐based catalysts for acidic OER applications.

We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental carbon and silicon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders K = 2 to K = 5 trained on a diverse carbon data set and on silicon dimers to pentamers. The potentials trained on diverse structures with standard ACE bases are not able to recover the correct dimer curves, much less produce stable curves or solutions. While employing ACE bases removed of self-interactions still does not generalize to the DFT-expected results, properly tailored data sets and basis sets are able to show signs of convergence and stability in the curves and expansions, suggesting a method to build potentials with interpretable bases with respect to the cluster expansion.

Abstract The dynamic dissolution of active species of electrocatalysts suffers severe durability issues, thus limiting practical sustainable electrochemical application despite the enormous strides in the activity. An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni–O 2 –Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof‐of‐concept strategy with S, Co co‐doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillations. In situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution, while the electron‐withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co–O 2 –Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800 h (5000‐h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05 kWh Nm −3 H 2 @ 4000 A m −2 . The levelized cost of hydrogen of US$ 2.315 per kg H2 overmatches the European Commission's target for the coming decade (<US$ 2.5 per kg H2 ).

While the protonation of homogeneous metal-oxide catalysts is quite relevant for mechanisms in aqueous solution, the relevance of surface acidity to catalytic mechanisms of heterogeneous metal oxides is far less understood. Without a distinguishing metric ascribed to transient intermediates, invoking surface acidity is limited to rationalizing pH-dependent product evolution. Recently, the emissive population associated with intermediates of electron and proton transfer at a titanium oxide surface demonstrated an isotherm with pH whose half-rise occurred at pH = 11.8. As detected by a time-resolved visible broadband probe, the intermediates formed within <2 ps upon photoexcitation of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an electron-doped (0.1% Nb) SrTiO3/aqueous interface. Here, we demonstrate how the pH dependence of the <2 ps population is preserved such that when the intermediate population finally decays with a time constant of 10 μs, it does so with a pH onset at 11.4. The distinctive pH associated with a metastable population ascribes a surface acidity to the first intermediate of water oxidation, interpreted as favoring Ti-OH• below and Ti-O•- above an acid dissociation constant (i.e., pKa). The work shows that the excited state optical spectroscopy is sensitive to protonation over the lifetime of metastable intermediates. Further, it shows that the details of the hydration layer prior to excitation are important for stabilizing intermediate populations of different acidities that then affect the chemical steps of water oxidation catalysis at longer time scales, e.g., bond formation.

The conformational ensemble of a molecule is strongly influenced by the surrounding environment. Correctly modeling the effect of any given environment is, hence, of pivotal importance in computational studies. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be able to model these interactions probabilistically, with successful applications demonstrated for classical molecular dynamics. While first instances of ML implicit solvents for quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations exist, the high computational cost of QM reference calculations hinders the development of a generally applicable ML implicit solvent model for QM calculations. Here, we present a novel way of developing such a general machine-learned QM implicit solvent model by transferring knowledge obtained from classical interactions to QM, emulating a QM/MM setup with electrostatic embedding and a nonpolarizable MM solvent. This has the profound advantages that neither QM/MM reference calculations nor experimental data are required for training and that the obtained graph neural network (GNN)-based implicit solvent model (termed QM-GNNIS) is compatible with any functional and basis set. QM-GNNIS is currently applicable to small organic molecules and describes 39 different organic solvents. The performance of QM-GNNIS is validated on NMR and IR experiments, demonstrating that the approach can reproduce experimentally observed trends unattainable by state-of-the-art implicit-solvent models paired with static QM calculations.

The surface chemical composition of supported single Pt-Rh core-shell nanoparticles was studied to understand the Rh behavior in oxidizing and reducing gas environments using spectro-microscopy with high spatial resolution. We combined in situ X-ray photoemission electron microscopy with ex situ scanning electron-, atomic force-, and scanning Auger-microscopy to distinguish Rh oxidation-reduction, dewetting-sintering, and alloying-segregation during the course of the experiment. A more than 20% higher Rh 3d5/2 oxide to metal photoemission intensity ratio for the Rh layer on top of the Pt-core was found as compared to the bare strontium titanate (STO) oxide catalyst support in close vicinity, where Rh/RhOx nanoparticles are forming. At elevated temperatures, Rh diffuses into the Pt particle, and this alloying at the Pt metal surface competes with Rh oxidation, whereas the Rh/RhOx nanoparticles on the STO support are observed to sinter under identical oxidizing and temperature environments. A nanoparticle facet-dependent analysis of selected Pt-core nanoparticles suggests that Rh oxidation is most advanced on a small nanoparticle with a low coordination top facet that we indexed by electron backscatter diffraction, demonstrating the strength of our correlative approach.

Abstract High-entropy alloys are increasingly recognised as promising catalyst materials due to their highly tunable compositions. In particular, the Cantor alloy, CrCoFeMnNi, has attracted significant interest as a low-cost, earth-abundant alternative to Pt-group catalysts. However, the Cantor alloy is susceptible to degradation in acidic environments. To address this, Pt has been proposed as an addition to the Cantor alloy to leverage the high catalytic activity and surface stability of Pt. In this study, we identify and elucidate the catalytic activity trend for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by screening CrCoFeMnNiPt alloys containing 50–100 at.% Pt and up to 50 at.% of each 3d element at 10 at.% resolution using a purely computational, machine learning-accelerated density-functional-theory workflow. Assuming the formation of a Pt skin through surface reconfiguration, a machine learning-accelerated simulation protocol infers the strain-corrected adsorption strengths of key reaction intermediates and uses them as descriptors for kinetic modelling. Our results show that Pt-modification of the Cantor alloy is a potentially viable strategy towards active and durable ORR catalysts. However, the simulations also predict binary Pt-rich alloys with approximately 80 at.% Pt to exhibit the highest ORR activity due to synergistic ligand and strain effects. As this model identifies known alloys with high ORR performance, we suggest that this framework contributes to a clear understanding of how bulk composition affects the reaction kinetics of complex surface alloys.

The urgent demand for Pt-free oxygen reduction catalysts drives exploration of tungsten-based alternatives, motivated by its Pt-mimetic valence electron configuration and optimal oxygen binding energy (ΔEO ≈ - 2.05 eV) revealed in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) volcano plots. Herein, a hierarchical W3N4-doped catalyst has been engineered through dual-stage thermal activation of covalent triazine framework (CTF)-tungstate complexes, where W precursors serve dual roles as self-sacrificing templates and active site generators. In-depth discussions via distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis elucidates that the hierarchical pore structure and active sites of WNNP-C demonstrate ∼90% reduction in relaxation time (τ = 0.18 vs 1.6 s of WNOSAC-C) at half potential and achieve a 0.83 V half-wave potential (E1/2) approaching Pt/C (0.865 V) in 0.1 M KOH coupled with exceptional methanol tolerance. The mechanistic analysis demonstrates that the enhanced electrical conductivity of the catalyst support facilitates the desorption of *OH intermediates by overcoming their elevated energy barrier, which preferentially promotes the 4e- ORR pathway and consequently improves the overall ORR performance. Moreover, the WNNP-C assembled zinc-air battery delivers 839 mAh gZn-1 specific capacity and over 140 h of stability at a discharge current density of 5 mA/cm2, validating the strategy's effectiveness in synchronizing porous architectures with W3N4 active centers. This work provides a paradigm for unlocking catalytic potential in traditionally inert transition metals through synergistic coordination pyrolysis engineering.

The conversion of CO2 to value-added compounds is an important part of the effort to store and reuse atmospheric CO2 emissions. Here, we focus on CO2 hydrogenation over so-called inverse catalysts: transition metal oxide clusters supported on metal surfaces. The conventional approach for computational screening of such candidate catalyst materials involves a reliance on density functional theory (DFT) to obtain accurate adsorption energies at a significant computational cost. Here, we present a machine learning (ML)-accelerated workflow for obtaining adsorption energies at the metal–oxide interface. We enumerate possible binding sites at the clusters and use DFT to sample a subset of these with diverse local adsorbate environments. The dataset is used to explore interpretable and black-box ML models with the aim of revealing the electronic and structural factors controlling adsorption at metal–oxide interfaces. Furthermore, the explored ML models can be used for low-cost prediction of adsorption energies on structures outside of the original training dataset. The workflow presented here, along with the insights into trends in adsorption energies at metal–oxide interfaces, will be useful for identifying active sites, predicting parameters required for microkinetic modeling of reactions on complex catalyst materials, and accelerating data-driven catalyst design.

Abstract The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) represents an energy‐efficient alternative to the traditional Haber‐Bosch process for industrial ammonia synthesis. However, the cleavage of the strong N≡N bond hinders the practical application of NRR. Herein, an innovative design strategy is proposed based on a Fe 76 Si 8 B 13 Nb 3 metallic glass (MG‐FeSiBNb) catalyst, featuring a unique amorphous structure with endogenous nanoscale compositional heterogeneity. This catalyst achieves an impressive ammonia yield rate of 92.1 µg h −1 mg −1 cat. in 0.1 m Na 2 SO 4 solution, surpassing most state‐of‐the‐art NRR electrocatalysts. Extended X‐ray absorption fine structure analysis reveals that MG‐FeSiBNb provides abundant unsaturated coordination sites, essential for effective N 2 adsorption. Furthermore, electronic structural characterizations and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Si, B, and Nb atoms into the Fe‐based matrix precisely tailors the local electronic environment, effectively shifting the Fe d‐band center toward the Fermi level. This electronic modulation enhances electron transfer efficiency, thus promoting the hydrogenation of * NH 2 to * NH 3 . Additionally, the amorphous nature of MG‐FeSiBNb suppresses hydrogen adsorption by eliminating well‐defined crystal facets, thereby selectively mitigating the hydrogen evolution reaction and enhancing NRR selectivity. This work offers not only a high‐performing NRR catalyst but also a generalizable strategy for sustainable electrocatalysis beyond conventional crystalline systems.

Abstract Structurally ordered high‐entropy intermetallics (HEIs) have garnered increased attention due to their unique physicochemical properties. The ordered atomic configuration and compositional diversity of HEIs contribute to optimal active‐site isolation, broad tunability of catalytic activity, and remarkable electrochemical stability. These advantages have enabled HEIs to achieve exceptional catalytic performance in various energy‐related applications, positioning them as promising candidates for next‐generation catalytic materials. However, comprehensive reviews on HEIs are scarce. This work provides a systematic overview of recent advances in HEIs research, encompassing innovative synthesis strategies, advanced characterization techniques, and catalytic applications such as the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction, and small‐molecule oxidation reactions. Furthermore, the unique catalytic properties of HEIs are thoroughly elucidated, while discussing the challenges and future research opportunities for HEI‐based catalysts. This work highlights the transformative potential of HEIs in driving the development of energy‐related catalytic technologies and provides valuable insights for designing next‐generation high‐performance catalysts.

Heterostructuring nanocrystals into a modular metal-semiconductor configuration enables tunable and novel functionalities. Such combinations at the nanoscale equip hybrid structures with unique electronic, optical, and catalytic properties unobserved in single-phase materials. Here, we report the hot-injection synthesis of Pd-Cu3Pd13S6.65Te0.35 nanoheterostructures (NHCs) from PdCu nanoalloy seeds. First, the growth of Pd-rich chalcogenide nanocrystals was initiated over the preformed PdCu surface through simultaneous sulfidation and tellurization, followed by their transformation into Pd-Cu3Pd13S6.65Te0.35 NHCs. By strategically employing moderate-temperature annealing, we achieved the complete migration of Cu+ due to the higher reactivity of Cu in comparison to Pd at that temperature, establishing a novel mechanistic relationship between cation mobility and temperature. This strategy enables controlled semiconductor domain formation and targeted metal migration. The NHCs showed efficient and stable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution with low Tafel values in acidic media, outperforming conventional nanoelectrocatalysts. Computational analysis identified the active sites responsible for the observed catalytic performance.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has largely subsided, it remains crucial to reflect on past experiences and shortcomings to better prepare for potential future outbreaks. Effective outbreak management is a complex scientific challenge that demands robust interdisciplinary collaboration. However, there is currently a lack of quantitative and objective assessments of progress in interdisciplinary research on coronaviruses, particularly measures that directly evaluate the extent of such collaborations. In this study, we employed Python-based algorithms to analyze 156,674 publications from the Web of Science database, tracing the development of coronavirus research and interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings reveal a significant upward trend in both the volume of coronavirus research and the intensity of interdisciplinary collaboration over the past 5 decades. Notably, major outbreaks have acted as critical catalysts, driving substantial advancements in this field. The past 2 decades, marked by three major coronavirus outbreaks, have seen dramatic growth in the scale and depth of interdisciplinary studies. Nevertheless, achieving seamless cross-disciplinary integration remains a persistent challenge. This study offers valuable insights for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and optimizing academic discipline structures in universities.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used in industry and consumer products due to their unique physical and chemical properties. However, due to their toxicity and environmental persistence, the production of long-chain PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) has been systematically phased out. Instead, short-chain PFAS have been widely used as replacements for long-chain PFAS. However, recent studies indicate that even short-chain PFAS can be toxic to the environment. Despite numerous attempts, complete degradation of these short-chain PFAS has not yet been achieved, leaving room for further exploration. In this work, we explored the potential of plasmonic silver (Ag) and gold (Au) nanoclusters (NCs) in the complete degradation of short-chain PFAS. By considering icosahedral Ag55 and Au55 NCs, as well as different types of PFAS, we present a thorough study of plasmon-induced processes for NC-PFAS complexes. Among different decay channels, our study focuses on plasmon decay through the direct hot electron transfer (DHET) and direct hot hole transfer (DHHT) pathways from NC to PFAS. Our calculations reveal that DHET is more probable in Ag-PFAS complexes and DHHT is more probable in Au-PFAS complexes. Furthermore, among all complexes, the Ag-PFBS complex exhibits the highest DHET with a total probability of 10%. Our Ehrenfest molecular dynamics simulations show that the PFAS in Ag-PFAS complexes undergo efficient degradation in the presence of these hot carriers, albeit at different rates.

We present MS25, a benchmark data set for evaluating machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) across diverse materials-relevant systems including MgO surfaces, liquid water, zeolites, a catalytic Pt surface reaction, high-entropy alloys (HEAs), and disordered Zr-oxides. Five MLIP architectures (MACE, NequIP, Allegro, MTP, and Torch-ANI) are trained and tested, focusing not only on traditional metrics (energies, forces, and stresses) but also explicitly validating derived physical observables such as lattice constants, volumes, and reaction barriers. We find that most models reach comparable accuracy on standard error metrics across the simple systems, although equivariant MLIPs offer 1.5-2× improvements over nonequivariant MLIPs in energy and force error for structurally complex or compositionally disordered environments such as HEAs and Zr-O systems. Our analysis highlights that low errors in energy and force predictions do not guarantee reliable observables, emphasizing the necessity of explicit validation. We demonstrate limitations in cross-framework transferability, as models trained on one zeolite framework (CHA) fail to reliably generalize to predictions of structurally distinct frameworks (e.g., MFI). Size-extensive tests show some dependence on system size for MgO, resulting from forced periodicity. The HEA and Zr-O data sets are identified as challenging tests for future benchmarks and MLIP model architecture developments as they show significant differentiation in error between MLIP architectures and are still relatively difficult at 1000 training images. Moving forward, we recommend that benchmarking efforts shift their focus from marginal accuracy improvements in energy and force errors toward identifying and understanding model failure modes, rigorously assessing transferability, and evaluating how their errors affect observable predictions. For researchers looking to choose an MLIP architecture, we suggest selecting equivariant MLIP architectures if the complexity of the system is a challenge. For simple materials problems, auxiliary features such as integration with molecular dynamics engines, trade-offs between computational data set generation cost vs MLIP inference speed, and framework integration may play a more important decision factor than small differences in error metrics that are unlikely to matter for production-level research.

Abstract Efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for energy conversion technologies, yet its sluggish kinetics remain a significant challenge. Beyond optimizing the catalyst's intrinsic properties, field effects can also profoundly impact the microenvironment at the catalyst/electrolyte interface, thereby affecting electrocatalytic performance. This study explores the tip‐enhanced ORR by leveraging the coupled effects of electric and magnetic fields at the reaction interface. The Pt‐loaded ferromagnetic Ni cone electrode generates strong localized electric fields that reorganize interfacial water molecules into a more ordered structure. This strengthens hydrogen bonding between the electrolyte and reaction intermediates, which in turn facilitates proton‐coupled electron transfer and accelerates the rate‐limiting *OH desorption into interfacial water matrix. Additionally, the amplified electric fields at tips accelerate OH − electromigration away from the catalyst surface, while the migration current couples with the concentrated magnetic fields near tips to drive strong magnetohydrodynamic flows. These intensified flows effectively enhance O 2 molecule delivery to wider electrode surface and facilitate better OH − product removal, thus improving the overall reaction efficiency. This strategy of concentrating both E/M fields using the field‐effect catalyst optimizes the ORR kinetics at the interface as well as the mass transport dynamics near interface, offering an effective approach for advancing ORR performance.

Amorphous metal‐based catalysts are highly promising for water splitting due to their abundance of unsaturated active sites. Herein, we report a one‐step, surfactant‐free synthesis of amorphous nickel nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen‐doped carbon shells (A‐Ni@NC) via pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL). The synergistic integration of the amorphous Ni core and a defect‐rich N‐doped carbon shell markedly enhanced the catalytic activities for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with low overpotentials of 182 mV for HER and 288 mV for OER at 10 mA cm −2 in 1.0 m KOH. Furthermore, the bifunctional catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at 1.63 V and retained 98.9% of its initial performance after 100 h of operation. The nitrogen‐rich carbon shell not only offered abundant active sites and structural protection but also promoted charge transport. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that N‐doping optimized intermediate adsorption energies, while the amorphous Ni core facilitated efficient electron transfer. This green and scalable synthesis strategy provides a promising platform for developing a wide range of transition metal@N‐doped carbon hybrid catalysts for sustainable energy conversion applications.

The development and design of Pt-based alloy catalysts with high activity and stability are important for the hydrogen evolution reaction, especially in acidic media. Here, we report a mild acid-impregnated reconfiguration strategy to construct defects and strain effect (PtRhNiMoPd NCs-80°C-6h) by removing unstable Ni atoms in acetic acid treatment. Only 5.6 mV is required to achieve a current density of -10 mA cm-2 for PtRhNiMoPd NCs-80°C-6h in an acid electrolyte. Meanwhile, PtRhNiMoPd NCs-80°C-6h exhibits negligible degradation after 10,000 cycles, which is superior to commercial Pt/C. This suggests that surface reconstruction can expose more efficient active sites and improve the adsorption of intermediates on the active sites, enhancing the catalytic performance. This study provides a new perspective for the rational design of high-entropy alloy nanomaterials with an efficient hydrogen evolution performance.

Understanding how the electronic structure of electrodes influences electrocatalytic reactions has been a longstanding topic in the electrochemistry community, with predominant attention paid to metallic electrodes. In this work, we present a defect physics perspective on the effect of semiconductor band structure on electrochemical redox reactions. Specifically, the Haldane–Anderson model, originally developed to study multiple charge states of transition-metal defects in semiconductors, is extended to describe electrochemical redox reactions by incorporating the solvent effect, inspired by the Holstein model. The solvent coordinate and the actual charge on the redox species in reduced and oxidized states are assumed to be in instant equilibrium, and the transitions between these states are defined by the framework of Green’s function. With these treatments, the charge state transitions are handled in a self-consistent manner, and the implications of charge self-consistency (or, equivalently, charge self-regulation) on electrocatalysis can be investigated explicitly. We first confirm that this self-consistent approach is essential to accurately depict the hybridization effect of band structure by comparing the model-calculated ionization potential and electron affinity, as well as the redox potential of the species, with those obtained from density functional theory calculations. Next, we illustrate that the effect of charge self-consistency is key to obtaining a fuller understanding of the catalytic activities of semiconductor electrodes and the source of asymmetry in reorganization energies, which is often observed in prior ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, we discuss how band structure impacts redox reactions in the strong coupling limit. Finally, we compare our work with other relevant studies in the literature.

Abstract The pursuit of low‐cost, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution in alkaline media is vital for water‐splitting applications. Herein, the hydrothermal‐based synthesis of a multiphase ferromagnetic catalyst CoFeP, comprising FeP, CoP, and Fe 2 P is reported. Structural analyses confirm the coexistence of phases, and electrochemical studies reveal excellent OER activity. CoFeP exhibits an overpotential of 335 mV at 50 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 116 mV dec −1 without a magnetic field, whereas under the magnetic field of 2000 G, these values lowered to 235 mV and 93 mV dec −1 , respectively. The enhancement is attributed to magnetic‐field‐induced spin polarization, surface reconstruction, and increased ECSA from 70 to 110 mF cm −2 , highlighting the potential of magnetic modulation for boosting catalytic performance. Through spin‐polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations, the structural and electronic features of CoFeP, providing theoretical insights into its role in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is elucidated. This investigation demonstrates that the application of an external magnetic field significantly reduces the overpotential required for OER as the adsorption of intermediate species becomes stronger due to more charge transfer, aligning with experimental observations. These findings highlight the interplay between magnetic fields and electrocatalytic performance, offering a pathway to enhance energy conversion efficiency.

Abstract Uncertainty quantification (UQ) and propagation is a ubiquitous challenge in science, permeating our field in a general fashion, and its importance cannot be overstated. Recently, the commoditization of differentiable programming, motivated by the development of machine learning, has allowed easier access to tools for evaluating derivatives of complex systems, of implicit and nonlinear nature. Motivated by this, we develop a UQ mapping approach based on differentiable programming principles. The approach is novel, faster, and yields equally accurate results when compared against the current state‐of‐the‐art approaches for the UQ problem, which is to quantify and map uncertainty using linear methods or expensive Monte Carlo simulations. Three case studies—namely a continuous stirred tank reactor, a membrane reactor, and a fed‐batch bioreactor—are assessed and compared against typical uncertainty mapping techniques. Lastly, the method allows the use of a single model implementation to perform forward and inverse uncertainty maps, easily switching mapping directions.
