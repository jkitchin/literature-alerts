Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) structures are widely recognized as promising candidates in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). According to the classical Sabatier principle, optimal 3d metal catalysts, such as Fe/Co–N–C, achieve superior catalytic performance due to the moderate binding strength. However, the substantial ORR activity demonstrated by weakly binding M–N–C catalysts such as Ni/Cu–N–C challenges current understandings, emphasizing the need to explore new underlying mechanisms. In this work, we integrated a pH-field coupled microkinetic model with detailed experimental electron state analyses to verify a novel key step in the ORR reaction pathway of weak-binding SACs─the oxygen adsorption at the metal–nitrogen bridge site. This step significantly altered the adsorption scaling relations, electric field responses, and solvation effects, further impacting the key kinetic reaction barrier from HOO* to O* and pH-dependent performance. Synchrotron spectra analysis further provides evidence for the new weak-binding M–N–C model, showing an increase in electron density on the antibonding π orbitals of N atoms in weak-binding M–N–C catalysts and confirming the presence of N–O bonds. These findings redefine the understanding of weak-binding M–N–C catalyst behavior, opening up new perspectives for their application in clean energy.

The accelerated demand for electrochemical energy storage urges the need for new, sustainable, and lightweight materials able to store high energy densities rapidly and efficiently. Development of these functional materials requires specialized techniques that can provide a close insight into the electrochemical properties at the nanoscale. For this reason, the electrochemical scanning microwave microscopy (EC-SMM) enabling local measurement of electrochemical properties with nanometer spatial resolution and sensitivity down to atto-Ampere electrochemical currents is introduced. Its power is demonstrated by studying NiCo-layered double hydroxide flakes, revealing active site locations and providing atomistic insights into the catalytic process. EC-SMM's spatial resolution of 16 ± 1 nm allows detailed analysis of edge effects in this 2D material, including localized electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Coupled with advanced numerical modeling of diffusion and migration dynamics at the material interface, the findings elucidate the previously hypothesized processes responsible for localized enhancements in electrochemical activity, while pinpointing essential parameters for tuning the thermodynamics of ion intercalation and optimizing surface adsorption.

Most state-of-the-art neural network potentials do not account for molecular attributes other than atomic numbers and positions, which limits its range of applicability by design. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of including additional electronic attributes in neural network potential representations with a minimal architectural change to TensorNet, a state-of-the-art equivariant model based on Cartesian rank-2 tensor representations. By performing experiments on both custom-made and public benchmarking data sets, we show that this modification resolves input degeneracy issues stemming from the use of atomic numbers and positions alone, while enhancing the model's predictive accuracy across diverse chemical systems with different charge or spin states. This is accomplished without tailored strategies or the inclusion of physics-based energy terms, while maintaining efficiency and accuracy. These findings should furthermore encourage researchers to train and use models incorporating these additional representations.

Electrocatalysts for oxidation and reduction reactions are crucial for sustainable energy production and carbon reduction. While precious metal catalysts exhibit superior activity, reducing reliance on them is necessary for large‐scale applications. To address this, transition metal‐based catalysts are studied with strategies to enhance catalytic performance. One promising strategy is heterostructures, which integrate multiple materials to harness synergistic effects. Developing efficient heterostructured electrocatalysts requires understanding their intricate characteristics, which poses challenges. While in situ and operando spectroscopy provides insights, computational materials science is essential for capturing reaction mechanisms, analyzing the origins at the atomic scale, and efficiently exploring innovative heterostructures. Despite growing recognition of computational materials science, standardized criteria for these systems remain lacking. This review consolidates case studies to propose approaches for modeling and analyzing heterostructures. It categorizes heterostructure types into vertical, semivertical, and lateral, defines their characteristics, and propose insights into minimizing or exploiting strain effects from lattice mismatches. Furthermore, it summarizes computational analyses of heterostructure stability and activity across reactions, including oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen reduction, and urea oxidation. This review provides an overview to refine heterostructure designs and establish a framework for systematic modeling and analysis to develop efficient electrocatalysts.

Abstract A novel 2D material that is a formidable opponent to graphene (Gr) is borophene, which stands as 2D boron sheets. This innovative material has gained interest in the energy sector due to its wide range of chemical properties, intricate structural geometries, possession of massless Dirac fermions, outstanding hardness, and high carrier mobility. Unlike Gr, which lacks a band gap, borophene exhibits a band gap, endowing it with distinct advantages. Although many advancements in borophene materials, including their synthesis, structural and electronic characterization, and applications, have been discussed in the literature, there is still a need for a quantitative and qualitative assessment from both the experimental and theoretical perspectives, as well as the learned lesson implication in real‐world applications of this material. This review highlights recent theoretical and experimental discoveries about borophene, focusing on key scientific findings, structural and electronic properties, and diverse applications, particularly in energy conversion processes and energy storage systems such as batteries and supercapacitors. Finally, the paper discusses current research challenges and future opportunities for large‐scale borophene synthesis and its potential uses.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a research frontier in catalytic materials, distinguished by their unique atom-level dispersion, which significantly enhances catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. SACs demonstrate substantial promise in electrocatalysis applications, such as fuel cells, CO2 reduction, and hydrogen production, due to their ability to maximize utilization of active sites. However, the development of efficient and stable SACs involves intricate design and screening processes. In this work, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NNs), offers powerful tools for accelerating the discovery and optimization of SACs. This review systematically discusses the application of AI technologies in SACs development through four key stages: (1) Density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations: DFT and AIMD are used to investigate catalytic mechanisms, with high-throughput applications significantly expanding accessible datasets; (2) Regression models: ML regression models identify key features that influence catalytic performance, streamlining the selection of promising materials; (3) NNs: NNs expedite the screening of known structural models, facilitating rapid assessment of catalytic potential; (4) Generative adversarial networks (GANs): GANs enable the prediction and design of novel high-performance catalysts tailored to specific requirements. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of AI applications in SACs and offers insights and recommendations for future advancements in the field.

As an electrocatalyst for water electrolysis, nickel oxide (NiO) has received significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness and high reactivity among non-noble-metal-based catalytic materials. However, NiO still exhibits poor alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics compared to conventional noble metal-based catalysts. This is because NiO has a strong interaction with protons for the HER and too low free energy of the OH* state, resulting in slower rate-determining step (RDS) kinetics for the OER. To address these issues, adding a dopant is suggested as an efficient method to modify the electron structure of the NiO electrocatalyst favorably for each reaction kinetics. In this context, we demonstrate that Bismuth (Bi), due to its higher electronegativity than that of Nickel (Ni), induces a positive charge on Ni sites. This enhances the catalytic activity by reducing the number of excessive cation interactions with the NiO electrocatalyst. Moreover, as the Bi ratio increases, the Ni reaction sites in NiO become more positively charged, and these changes in the electronic structure directly impact the free energy of the reaction mechanism. Particularly, it is confirmed that for the HER, Bi additives increase the proton-adsorbed free energy toward a near-zero value and, additionally, decrease the free energy difference of the second step considered as the RDS in the OER, as calculated by density functional theory. The positive effects of Bi in both the HER and the OER are demonstrated in practical electrochemical evaluations of half/single cells. Notably, the Bi-containing catalysts Bi05:NiO and Bi02:NiO exhibit remarkable alkaline HER and OER kinetics, showing performance improvements of 97.0% and 21.9%, respectively.

Integrating the therapeutic efficacy of early bacterial clearance, midstage inflammatory remission, and late-stage effective tissue healing is considered a pivotal challenge in symptomatic treatment of infected bone defects (IBDs). Herein, a microenvironment-adaptive nanoplatform based on a sulfur quantum dot (SQD) nanozyme was proposed for whole-stage symptomatic therapy of IBDs by mediating the sequence of enzyme cascade reactions. The SQD nanozyme prepared by a size-engineering modification strategy exhibits enhanced multienzyme activity compared to conventional micrometer- and nanometer-sized sulfur particles. In the early stages of bacterial infection, the SQD nanozyme self-activates superoxide dismutase-peroxidase activity, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that effectively eliminate bacteria. After disinfection, the SQD nanozyme self-switched to superoxide dismutase-catalase mimetic behavior and eliminated excess ROS, efficiently promoting macrophage polarization to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in the midinflammatory microenvironment. Importantly, SQD nanozyme-mediated M2 macrophage polarization significantly improved the damaged bone immune microenvironment, accelerating bone repair at late-stage tissue healing. Therefore, this strategy offers a promising and viable approach for the treatment of infectious tissue healing by developing multienzyme-activity nanozymes that respond intelligently to the microenvironment at different stages, effectively fighting bacteria, reducing inflammation, and promoting tissue regeneration for whole-stage symptomatic therapy.

Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D-COFs) exhibit high activity in the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), while the structure-performance relationship toward which remains an unsolved problem, therefore hindering the development of efficient catalysts. In this work, a total of 145 candidate transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc-DX) materials comprised of 29 transition metals and X-phthalocyanine (X = N, O, F, S, and Cl) are evaluated for their capabilities in the NRR by density functional theory calculations. Our computations showed that metal atoms in TMPc-DN/DF/DCl materials could efficiently activate N2 molecules by doping with electron-withdrawing groups. The catalysts MoPc-DN and NbPc-DN are recognized to exhibit the highest electrocatalytic performance for the NRR with the lowest limit potentials of 0.31 and 0.32 V, respectively. Moreover, NbPc-DN showed a significant advantage by suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction, making it a top contender among TMPc-DX materials for the electrocatalytic NRR. Through detailed orbital interaction analysis, our research has demonstrated that embedding transition metals into the substrate (Pc-DX) results in a direct correlation between the number of electrons transferred to the substrate and the reduction of energy splitting of the metal's d orbital, which directly causes a decrease in the metal's magnetic moment. Consequently, the affinity of the metal for N2 adsorption is directly proportional to the extent of the electron transfer. Our findings underscore the significance of the material's magnetic moment as a preliminary indicator for gauging the effectiveness of N2 adsorption.

Glycerol electrolysis is a promising strategy for generating hydrogen at the cathode and value-added products at the anode. However, the effect of the atomic distribution within catalysts on their catalytic performance remains largely unexplored, primarily because of the inherent complexity of the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). Herein, an ordered Pt3Mn (O-Pt3Mn) intermetallic compound and a disordered Pt3Mn (D-Pt3Mn) alloy are used as model catalysts, and their performance in the GOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is studied. O-Pt3Mn consistently outperforms D-Pt3Mn and commercial Pt/C catalysts. It can generate high-value glycerate at a notable production rate of 17 mM h–1 while achieving an impressively low cell voltage of 0.76 V for glycerol electrolysis, which is ∼0.98 V lower than that required for water electrolysis. Statistical analysis using theoretical calculations reveals that Pt–Pt–Pt hollow sites are crucial for the catalytic GOR and HER. The averaged adsorption energies of key intermediates (simplified as C*, O*, and H*) on diverse catalysts closely correlate with their experimentally observed activity. Our proposed linear models accurately predict these adsorption energies, exhibiting high correlation coefficients ranging from 0.97 to 0.99 and highlighting the significance of the distribution of the topmost and subsurface-corner Mn atoms in determining these adsorption energies. By sampling all possible Mn configurations within the fitted linear models, we confirm that O-Pt3Mn establishes the maximum activity threshold for the GOR and HER compared with any disordered variant. This study presents an innovative framework for exploring the effect of the atomic distribution within catalysts on their catalytic performance and designing high-performance catalysts for complex reactions.

Conformational sampling is nowadays a standard routine in computational chemistry. Within this work, we present a method to perform conformational sampling for systems exposed to elevated pressures within the CREST program, allowing us to model pressure-induced changes of molecular ensembles and structural parameters. For this purpose, we extend the molecular Hamiltonian with the PV (pressure times volume) term, using the solvent-accessible volume. The volume computation is performed within the new standalone library libpvol. A first application shows good agreement with experimental data and provides a reasonable explanation for severe pressure-induced structural and spectroscopic changes of the molecules dichloroethane and tetra(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylene.

Abstract Human breath contains over 3000 volatile organic compounds, abnormal concentrations of which can indicate the presence of certain diseases. Recently, metal–organic framework (MOF)‐metal oxide composite materials have been explored for chemiresistive sensor applications, however their ability to detect breath compounds associated with specific diseases remains unknown. In this work, a new high‐throughput computational protocol for evaluating the sensing ability of MOF‐metal oxide toward small organic compounds is presented. This protocol uses a cluster‐based method for accelerated structure relaxation, and a combination of binding energies and density‐of‐states analysis to evaluate sensing ability, the latter measured using Wasserstein distances. This protocol is applied to the case of the MOF‐metal oxide composite material NM125‐TiO 2 and is shown to be consistent with previously reported experimental results for this system. The sensing ability of NM125‐TiO 2 for over 100 human‐breath compounds spanning 13 different diseases is examined. Statistical inference is then used to identify diseases which subsequent experimental efforts should focus on. Overall, this work provides new tools for computational sensor research, while also illustrating how computational materials science can be integrated into the field of preventative medicine.

Abstract Point defects in semiconductors dictate their electronic and optical properties. Vacancies, interstitials, substitutional defects, and defect complexes can form in the semiconductor lattice and significantly impact its performance in applications such as solar absorption, light emission, electronics, and catalysis. Understanding the nature and energetics of point defects is essential for the design and optimization of next-generation semiconductor technologies. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on point defects in semiconductors, focusing on the application of density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in accelerating the prediction and understanding of defect properties. DFT has been instrumental in accurately calculating defect formation energies, charge transition levels, and other defect-related properties such as carrier recombination rates and lifetimes, and ion migration barriers. ML techniques, particularly neural networks, have emerged as powerful tools for enabling rapid prediction of defect properties at DFT-accuracy in order to overcome the expense of using large supercells and advanced functionals. We begin this article with a discussion of different types of point defects and complexes, their impact on semiconductor properties, and the experimental and DFT approaches typically used for their characterization. Through multiple case studies, we explore how DFT has been successfully applied to understand defect behavior across a variety of semiconductors, and how ML approaches integrated with DFT can efficiently predict defect properties and facilitate the discovery of new materials with tailored defect behavior. Overall, the advent of ‘DFT+ML’ promises to drive advancements in semiconductor technology, catalysis, and renewable energy applications, paving the way for the development of high-performance semiconductors which are defect-tolerant or have desirable dopability.

Abstract Iridium (Ir) is recognized to have extremely high catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there are still technical challenges in maximizing the utilization of Ir atoms in the catalytic reaction process through dimensional regulation strategies. Herein, an innovative strategy is utilized to fabricate porous phosphorus‐doped iridium (P‐Ir) with a 2D structure, specifically the reduction of 1T phase‐IrO 2 (1T‐IrO 2 ) nanosheets using phosphine gas. The optimized P‐Ir achieves an overpotential of 17.2 mV (vs RHE without i R‐correction) in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 during the HER process, outperforming benchmark Pt/C (27.0 mV) and most reported Ir‐based electrocatalysts. During the long‐term stability tests, P‐Ir maintains stable operation for more than 100 h at both −10 and −100 mA cm −2 , respectively. Moreover, the HER activity and transient potential scanning results of Ir‐based phosphides prove that doping P atoms in the Ir lattice promotes the reaction kinetic rate and charge transport capacity during hydrogen evolution. Theoretical calculations reveal that P atoms doping weakens the adsorption energy of H intermediates (H*) by regulating the d ‐band center of the Ir sites. Simultaneously, the desorption process of H* is also facilitated by forming a special bridged‐H* bond structure, eventually accelerating the HER kinetics.

Layered orthorhombic single crystals of EuYCuTe3 are synthesized using the ampoule method from the elemental precursors taken in the ratio of 1 Eu:1 Y:1 Cu:3 Te by heating up to 1120 K with an excess of CsI as flux. The orthorhombic structure of EuYCuTe3 is established, and structural parameters are obtained using X-ray diffraction. At ambient conditions, the sample crystallizes in the space group Pnma with the unit cell parameters a = 11.2730(7) Å, b = 4.3214(3) Å, c = 14.3271(9) Å. The structure is composed of vertex-connected [CuTe4]7− tetrahedra, which form chains along the [010] direction, and of edge-connected [YTe6]9− octahedra, which form layers parallel to the (010) plane. The Eu2+ cations are found in a capped trigonal prismatic coordination of Te2− anions. The structural phase transition from the α to the β phase is discovered upon heating the sample to 323 K, which comes accompanied with a decrease of [CuTe4]7− tetrahedral distortion. The symmetry of the high-temperature phase is established as ordered in the space group Cmcm (a = 4.3231(3) Å, b = 14.3328(9) Å, c = 11.2843(7) Å). The nature and microscopic mechanism of the phase transition is discussed. By cooling it down below 3 K, the soft ferromagnetic properties of EuYCuTe3 are discovered. The correlation of the ferromagnetic transition temperature in the series of chalcogenides EuYCuCh3 (Ch = S, Se, Te) with the ionic radius of the chalcogenide anion is established. The structural dynamical elastic properties of α- and β-EuYCuTe3 were calculated within the ab initio approach. The vibrational mode frequencies and decomposition on irreducible representations, as well as the degree of ion involvement in each mode, were determined. The calculations reveal an imaginary mode in the Y-point of the Brillouin zone in the high symmetry β-EuYCuTe3 phase. This finding explains the nature of structural reconstruction in EuYCuTe3 crystal as a second-order phase transition induced by soft mode condensation at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The exfoliation of a single layer is simulated theoretically. The exfoliation energy is estimated, and the dynamical properties of EuYCuTe3 single layers are studied.

Developing a highly active and stable catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), the key half-reaction for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, has been one of the most cutting-edge topics in electrocatalysis. A dual-doping strategy optimizes the catalyst electronic environment, modifies the coordination environment, generates vacancies, and introduces strain effects through the synergistic effect of two elements to achieve high catalytic performance. In this review, we summarize the progress of dual doping in RuO2 or IrO2 for acidic OERs. The three main mechanisms of OERs are dicussed firstly, followed by a detailed examination of the development history of dual-doping catalysts, from experimentally driven dual-doping systems to machine learning (ML) and theoretical screening of dual-doping systems. Lastly, we provide a summary of the remaining challenges and future prospects, offering valuable insights into dual doping for acidic OERs.

While urea is widely used as a chemical raw material, its precursor ammonia (NH3) has traditionally been synthesized under high-temperature/pressure conditions, leading to not only huge energy consumption but also serious CO2 emission. Here, we present a groundbreaking catalyst design approach, which optimizes adsorption configurations and reaction pathways by controlling the adsorption energies of each intermediate in the reaction, thus enhancing catalytic performance. Via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a triatomic catalyst [i.e., Fe2Mo@γ-graphdiyne (γ-GDY)] with a limiting potential of -0.22 V and a C-N coupling energy barrier of 0.34 eV. Notably, the Fe2Mo@γ-GDY catalyst presents a high selectivity and robust antioxidation capabilities under applied potentials. Our comprehensive analysis elucidates the factors affecting the limiting potential and C-N coupling energy barrier. These insights significantly contribute to the advancement of catalyst design strategies for electrocatalytic urea synthesis, offering a more efficient and eco-friendly alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are very often used to make predictions for datasets that were created externally in arbitrary experiments or on already literature known datasets. In this work, we try to make use of active learning techniques to search for an optimal strategy for the startup‐phase of bulk nickel electrodes in the oxygen evolution reaction. The data collected was afterwards reduced in dimensions and used to extract additional information that were learned via an artificial neural network (ANN) on the dataset, respectively.

Electrolytic manganese metal (EMM) produced from recyclable resources has recently gained increasing attention due to the scarcity of high-quality manganese natural resources and its broad range of applications. This review has summarised recent progress in manganese recovery techniques, including pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. It has also critically assessed the processes and mechanisms involved in manganese electrodeposition for the Mn chloride- and Mn sulphate-based systems, with a major focus on electrode reactions and Mn nucleation growth. The key optimisation factors influencing manganese electrodeposition, such as electrolytes, power consumption, additives, cell structures, and electrode materials, were analysed, with particular attention to their impact on current efficiency, specific energy consumption, and product quality. The recent research directions were also highlighted to address practical challenges and enhance the sustainability of the EMM process, which mainly includes improving the ecological outcomes and reducing both the operating and investment costs. Promising strategies for the simultaneous production of EMM and electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) were also identified, which mainly comprised applying membrane technology, electrodeposition from ionic liquids, recycling and reusing waste materials, and exploring hybrid techniques. The results of this study showed that the prospective optimisation approaches for EMM are mainly driven by the need to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve product quality through sustainable technological advancements. This review can be used as a comprehensive guide for manganese electrodeposition approaches for both practical and scientific research communities.

The prediction of the electron density in molecules and crystals is a key pillar in the first-principles computation of their properties. Using machine learning to predict the electron density by using the atomic structure alone can save the computational cost of performing first-principles computations. While various machine learning approaches have been introduced for predicting the electron density, none of them predict the electron density for charged systems. This work extends a recent machine learning charge density model, DeepDFT, by including the charge of the structure as an input parameter into the model. We establish an input charge representation approach that successfully predicts the charged electron densities for several test cases, including charged defective perovskites, LiCoO2 supercells with multiple Li vacancies, diamond-based defects, metal-organic frameworks, and molecular crystals.
