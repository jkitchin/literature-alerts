Noble metal electrocatalysts remain the mainstay for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, majorly due to their exceptional activity and durability in acidic media. However, conventional powder and particle catalysts intensively suffer from aggregation, shedding and poor electron conductivity in practical applications. Here, we develop a micellar brush-guided method to agglomerate and smelt metal nanoparticles into erect nanoarrays with designable constitutions on various substrates. While the nanoarrays of stacked nanoparticles show poor stability in the acidic media, the smelting treatment substantially enhances the electron conductivity by more than four order of magnitude and reinforces the nanoarray architectures. This allows the tailored fabrication of self-supported acid-durable metallic and alloy nanoarray catalysts with outstanding hydrogen evolution activity, and metal oxide nanoarray with extraordinary oxygen evolution activity. The integration of metallic Ru-nanoarray and RuOx-nanoarray in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer further enables a long-term stable water electrolysis process for more than 500 h at 1 A cm-2.

Different nanoporous graphene structures have shown great promise for a wide variety of applications. However, due to limitations in experimental or computational throughput, nanoporous graphenes have not been investigated systematically. In this work, we combine density functional theory and machine learning to study 460 structures of nanoporous graphene made from four different templates. We shed light on structure-band gap relations and perform molecular dynamics simulations and phonon calculations in order to determine the role of electron-phonon coupling on the renormalization of temperature-dependent band gaps. Our results uncover that certain subsets of nanoporous graphene exhibit a similar trend in the band gap as a function of a structural parameter as has been observed for armchair graphene nanoribbons. Furthermore, we find that electron-phonon coupling varies over a large range in the investigated nanoporous graphenes and that it drives the closing of the band gap with larger temperatures. Finally, we suggest nanoporous graphene structures for different applications, such as field-effect transistors. Thus, our work can help guide the development and improvement of nanoporous graphene-based devices.

The many-body expansion (MBE) of the lattice energy enables an ab initio description of molecular solids using correlated wave function approximations. However, the practical application of MBE requires computing the large number of n-body contributions efficiently. To this end, we employ a multi-level coupled-cluster approach which adapts the approximation level based on interaction type and intermolecular distance. The high-level method, including connected triple excitations, is applied only to monomer relaxation and dimer interactions roughly within the first and second coordination shells. Long-range dimers and trimers are treated using a simplified coupled-cluster description based on the random-phase approximation (RPA). A key feature is an energy correction which mitigates the underbinding error of the base RPA. Convergence to the bulk limit is accelerated by the addition of the periodic Hartree-Fock correction. The proposed approach is validated against recent diffusion Monte Carlo reference data for the X23 data set, achieving a mean absolute error of 3.1 kJ/mol, i.e., chemical accuracy for absolute lattice energies.

To probe the properties of single atoms is a challenging task, especially from the experimental standpoint, due to sensitivity limits. Nevertheless, it is sometimes possible to achieve this by making corresponding choices and adjustments to the experimental technique and sample under investigation. In the present case, the absolute value of the electronic charge the Fe atoms acquire when they are adsorbed on the surface of aluminum oxide α-Al2O3(0001) was measured by a set of surface-sensitive techniques: low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and work function (WF) measurements, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The main focus was the submonolayer coverage of Fe atoms in situ deposited on the well-ordered stoichiometric α-Al2O3(0001) 7 nm thick film formed on a Mo(110) crystal face. An analysis of the evolution of the Fe LVV Auger triplet upon variation of the Fe coverage shows that there is electronic charge transfer from Fe to alumina and that its value gradually decreases as the Fe coverage grows. The same trend is also predicted by the DFT results. Extrapolation of the experimental Fe charge value versus coverage plot yields an estimated value of a single Fe atom adsorbed on α-Al2O3(0001) of 0.98e (electron charge units), which is in reasonable agreement with the calculated value (+1.15e). The knowledge of this value and the possibility of its adjustment may be important points for the development and tuning of modern sub-nanometer-scale technologies of diverse applied relevance and can contribute to a more complete justification and selection of the corresponding theoretical models.

Exploring the interaction configurations between substrates and atomic or molecular systems is crucial for various scientific and technological applications, such as characterizing catalytic reactions, solvation structures, and molecular interactions. Traditional approaches for generating substrate-reactant configurations often rely on chemical intuition, symmetry operations, or random initial states, which can be inefficient and challenging for systems with low symmetry or unknown interaction mechanisms. This work introduces a systematic and automated methodology to explore the configuration space between substrates and adsorbates using symmetry-invariant features that characterize the local atomistic topology of the substrate. The approach involves three key components: (1) defining and discretizing a contact space surrounding the substrate, (2) utilizing symmetry-invariant descriptors to capture local atomic environments, and (3) employing unsupervised machine-learning techniques for clustering and hierarchical analysis of interaction sites. The method ensures comprehensive yet nonredundant sampling of the configuration space, independent of the substrate dimensionality. Applications to simple ideal substrates show that symmetry intuition and high-symmetry sites are correctly recovered. Moreover, the method is shown to translate seamlessly to less symmetric substrates.

Hydrogen-centered electrochemical technologies play a vital role in sustainable energy conversion and storage. One of the challenges in achieving cheap hydrogen is to bridge the gap between advanced electrocatalysts and highly effective electrodes. The key lies in designing electrocatalysts with high intrinsic activity and understanding the structure–activity relationship in water electrolysis. Being proposed as promising electrocatalysts, bulk oxides, with their compositional and crystal structure flexibility, provide a good platform for studying the correlation between intrinsic activity and electronic structure and also for screening superior catalysts for water electrolysis. In this review, we discuss the recent developments of oxide electrocatalysts in understanding the structure–activity relationship. Firstly, we present a thorough overview of recent advances from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Subsequently, we highlight the design principles to provide guidance for promoting performance. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives about this field are presented. This review aims to provide guidance for the design of highly advanced oxide electrocatalysts for water electrolysis and large-scale green energy supply.

Synthesizing radicals that have both long lifetimes and high chemical reactivity remains a long-term challenge. Here, persistent phenyl radicals are successfully synthesized on Ag(111) by protecting the carbon radical site by designing the precursor molecule with suitable steric hindrance. As carbon-carbon coupling is prohibited, such radicals remain intact for longer than 6 hours at room temperature on Ag(111). Taking advantage of the long lifetimes, the as-synthesized radicals are directly characterized in the real space at the single-chemical-bond scale by means of bond-resolving scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. Accompanied by the excellent stability, the radicals exhibit high chemical reactivities and facilitate the intermolecular radical transfer reactions at extreme low temperature. The preparation of persistent radicals not only favors the characterization of a surface-stabilized radical in the real space but also aids in illuminating the detailed reaction pathways of subsequent radical-assisted reactions directly.

Renewable electricity driven CO2 electroreduction into methane offers a sustainable route to mitigate our dependence on natural gas. However, this route is now limited by the unsatisfied efficiency and short durability, which originates from a kinetic disparity between water dissociation (WD) and proton-coupled electron transfer on existing catalysts. Herein, we harness the exceptional WD capability of the intermetallic electride (IE) materials for the electrocatalytic methanization from CO2. Combinative experimental and theoretical approaches strongly evidence a spontaneous WD on an IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst due to its unique electronic structure (strongly modified charge states, reversible lattice hydride ions and anionic electrons). Consequently, this catalyst exhibits improved methanization performance in alkaline flow cells, achieving a methane Faraday efficiency of 72% at -1.21 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and peak partial current density of 476.7 mA cm-2 at -1.52 V vs. RHE. Energetic calculations further establish the mechanistic link between WD and methanization processes on our catalyst, on which a lowered free energy barrier for the key *CO to *CHO transformation step is observed. This work sheds light on the pivotal role of WD and expands the repertoire of materials for efficient electrocatalytic methanization from CO2.

MXenes have emerged as promising candidates for energy storage and catalyst design. Through detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a series of new 2D composite MXene-based nanomaterials by covering excellent TM3N2 MXenes (TM = Nb, Ta, Mo, and W) with graphene or buckled silicene. Our findings demonstrate that this coating can lead to high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in these composite MXene-based systems, with silicene exhibiting superior performance compared to graphene. The relevant carbon and silicon atoms in the coated materials serve as active sites for HER due to complex electron transfer processes. Additionally, doping N or P atoms into graphene/silicene, which have similar atomic radii, but larger electronegativity than C/Si atoms, can further enhance the HER activity of adjacent carbon or silicon atoms, thus endowing the composite systems with higher HER catalytic performance. Coupled with their high stability and metallic conductivity, all these composite systems show great potential as electrocatalysts for HER. These remarkable findings offer new strategies and valuable insights for designing non-precious and highly efficient MXene-based HER electrocatalysts.

Abstract This report examines the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by iron‐polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) and pyrazine‐linked iron‐coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz‐FeTPr) conjugated organic polymer (COP) catalysts, utilizing grand‐canonical density functional theory (GC‐DFT) and microkinetic (MK) simulations. The computed half‐wave potential for AA stacking FePPc under alkaline conditions is in strong agreement with experimental findings. The ORR mechanism for AA stacking FePPc is characterized by the * O 2 mechanism (), with the Fe site serving as the active site. In the case of Pz‐FeTPr, the ORR mechanism is similarly governed by the * O 2 mechanism, with the Fe site remaining the active site at lower potentials (less than 0.5 V RHE , vs reversible hydrogen electrode). However, at higher potentials (greater than 0.5 V RHE ), the Fe site becomes obstructed by , resulting in a shift of the active site from the Fe site to a neighboring C site (designated as type A3). The corresponding ORR mechanism at the C site is denoted as mechanism (). This mechanism yields a calculated half‐wave potential that aligns well with experimental observations. The mechanisms identified for FePPc and Pz‐FeTPr can be substantiated by the Raman signals detected in experimental studies.

Abstract Aminopolymer‐based adsorbents are a prominent class of materials being used for direct air capture of CO 2 at the industrial scale. However, improving their working lifetime, specifically by increasing their resilience to oxidative degradation, remains an ongoing challenge. Toward this end, functionalization of aminopolymers with non‐amine functionalities such as hydroxyls has emerged in recent years as a promising strategy toward improving adsorbent lifetime. Although there is a growing body of work demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach and investigating the origin of this improved stability, studies to date have primarily focused on branched aminopolymer systems such as branched poly(ethylenimine). In this work, hydroxyl‐functionalized linear poly(ethylenimine) is used to continue to probe the underlying protective mechanism of this strategy. A combination of thermogravimetric analysis, NMR relaxometry, differential scanning calorimetry, and computational simulations is used to better understand the relationship between the extent of chemical functionalization, physical properties, and adsorbent performance.

Abstract This study investigates the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)₂) catalysts, focusing on the roles of oxygen vacancies (O v ), charge transfer, and silk fibroin. Spectroelectrochemical techniques, including in situ surface‐enhanced Raman (SERS) and UV–vis spectroscopy, revealed that O v formation and Ni‐to‐Au charge transfer facilitate the generation of high‐valence Ni and superoxide species. A Mars–van Krevelen mechanism is proposed to describe the participation of lattice oxygen. Silk fibroin is found to enhance catalytic activity by lowering the activation energy of key intermediates, as indicated by higher transfer coefficients and Tafel slope analysis. At +300 mV overpotential, fibroin‐modified samples exhibited intrinsic turnover frequencies (TOFs) of ≈0.7 s⁻¹, outperforming fibroin‐free counterparts (≈0.4 s⁻¹). These results highlight the synergy between structural defects and interfacial modifications in improving Ni(OH)₂‐based OER catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

Abstract The stabilization of single‐atom catalysts on semiconductor substrates is pivotal for advancing photocatalysis. TiO 2 , a widely employed photocatalyst, typically stabilizes single atoms at oxygen vacancies—sites that are accessible but prone to agglomeration under illumination. Here, we demonstrate that cation vacancies in Ti‐deficient TiO 2 nanosheets provide highly stable anchoring sites for Pt single atoms, enabling persistent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Ultrathin TiO 2 nanosheets with intrinsic Ti 4+ vacancies are synthesized via lepidocrocite‐type titanate delamination and Pt single atoms are selectively trapped within these vacancies through a simple immersion process. The resulting Pt‐decorated nanosheets exhibit superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, outperforming both Pt nanoparticle‐loaded nanosheets and benchmarked Pt single‐atom catalysts on P25. Crucially, Pt atoms anchored at Ti 4+ vacancies display remarkable resistance to light‐induced agglomeration, a key limitation of conventional single‐atom photocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Pt incorporation into Ti 4+ vacancies is highly thermodynamically favorable and optimizes hydrogen adsorption energetics for enhanced catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical role of cation defect engineering in stabilizing single‐atom co‐catalysts and advancing the efficiency and durability of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Abstract Mechanistic understanding of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics is crucial for developing high-performance fuel cell anode catalysts. Adsorbed hydroxide (OHad) significantly impacts HOR kinetics in alkaline conditions by directly participating as a reactant, but its impact in acidic conditions is overlooked due to its instability on metal surfaces and inability to be replenished. Here, we demonstrate that OHad can be stably anchored on Ru, Pd, and Rh surfaces in the HOR potential region through pre-electrooxidation treatment, significantly promoting their acidic HOR kinetics. In-situ spectroscopies and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation verify that OHad persists on pre-oxidized metal surfaces and alters the water orientation from ‘H-down’ to ‘O-down’ within the electric double layer. This change shortens the distance between adsorbed hydrogen (Had) and interfacial water and promotes the formation of the interfacial hydrogen-bond network, thereby weakening the apparent hydrogen binding energy and reducing Had desorption energy barriers from the catalyst surface to bulk electrolyte, enhancing acidic HOR kinetics. Inspired by the fundamental understandings, a Ru-RuOx(OH)y catalyst is synthesized, achieving a 41-fold enhancement in HOR mass activity compared with Ru/C. The Ru-RuOx(OH)y illustrates comparable performance to Pt in practical proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applications and superior voltage reversal tolerance during start-up/shut-down processes, enabling the development of a totally Pt-free PEMFC.

The persistent paradox in electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3-RR)─the requirement of high overpotentials despite its highly exothermic nature─remains a critical roadblock for efficient ammonia electrosynthesis. Here, we resolve this conundrum by identifying a high-valent anionic intermediate as kinetic gatekeepers during the nitrate reduction on a single-atom catalyst by using AIMD simulations under explicit solvation and electrode potentials. Employing our self-developed constant-potential thermodynamic integration method, we reveal a stark kinetic barrier dichotomy: while the reaction is thermodynamically favorable governed by the N-O break, the protonation to oxygen at a low anionic state necessitates substantial activation energy. Mechanistic analysis uncovers that electrode polarization preactivates *NO3- into a metastable high-valent *NO32- intermediate, which serves as the key step to the following protonation process. Crucially, this intermediate's stabilization requires a highly negative potential, directly linking its formation to the observed overpotential. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations also demonstrate that K+ cations play a key role in electrostatically stabilizing the adsorption of negatively charged NO3- onto the negatively polarized cathode. This work calls for the urgent reconsideration of conventional nitrate reduction mechanisms and the exigency of refined interface design principles for improved nitrate electrocatalysis.
