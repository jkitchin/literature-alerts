Abstract The catalytic conversion of CO 2 into high‐value C 2+ products offers a sustainable path toward carbon neutrality. However, traditional photocatalytic and thermal catalytic methods face challenges like low selectivity and yields. Herein, a novel Cu/MoS 2 photothermal catalyst is synthesized via a two‐step hydrothermal method, anchoring single‐atom Cu on layered MoS 2 for CO 2 and H 2 O reduction into C 2 products (ethanol, acetylene, and ethane). Under optimal conditions (250 °C, 903 mW·cm −2 , 320–780 nm), the Cu 5% –MoS 2 catalyst achieves an ethanol yield of 3.1 mmol·g −1 ·h −1 , 4.6 times higher than blank MoS 2 . Mechanistic studies reveal that Cu improves light absorption and enhances CO 2 adsorption and *COOH accumulation at MoS 2 edge S sites, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mo–Cu dual sites stabilize *CHO intermediates, boosting C 2 product selectivity. The synergistic photothermal effect accelerates charge migration and surface reactions. This work provides cost‐effective insights into photothermal CO 2 conversion for fuel production.

Sensitive detection of protein biomarkers is crucial for advancing biomedical research and clinical management. Although colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (CELISAs) have been widely recognized as a benchmark technique for protein biomarker detection, their sensitivity is fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic catalytic limitations of conventional enzyme labels. In this study, we present the engineering of high-performance Pt-based peroxidase nanozymes leveraging the synergistic effects of strain and ligand interactions. This advancement enables the development of an ultrasensitive CELISA platform capable of detecting protein biomarkers at femtomolar levels, providing a promising solution to address the existing sensitivity limitations. These Pt-based peroxidase nanozymes are precisely engineered by conformally coating Pd nanocubes with uniform, ultrathin Pt shells consisting of just four atomic layers (Pd@Pt4L nanocubes). The atomic-level Pt shells endow the Pd@Pt4L nanocubes with the strain and ligand effects, resulting in a ∼2000-fold enhancement in peroxidase-like catalytic activity compared to traditional horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and thus making them highly efficient as catalytic labels for enhancing the sensitivity of CELISAs. Taking interleukin-6 (IL-6) detection as an example, we demonstrate that the Pd@Pt4L nanocube-based CELISA enables quantitative analysis within a dynamic range of 0.05-5 pg mL-1 and achieves an impressive limit of detection (LOD) of 0.046 pg mL-1 (1.8 fM), representing a ∼20-fold enhancement in sensitivity over the conventional HRP-based CELISA. These discoveries underscore the impact of strain and ligand modulation on enhancing the catalytic activity of nanozymes and highlight their potential as catalytic labels for advancing ultrasensitive bioassay technologies.

Borophene, a novel two‐dimensional boron allotrope, has rapidly emerged as a transformative material due to its unique atomic configurations and tunable properties. Its intrinsic electron deficiency gives rise to a diverse range of structural motifs from atomically thin flat sheets to corrugated and striped architectures that underpin remarkable mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and superior ion transport. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in borophene synthesis, stabilization, and functionalization. Special emphasis is placed on understanding how defect engineering, heteroatom doping, and the formation of heterostructures can mitigate borophene's inherent instability while enhancing its catalytic and electrochemical performance. In particular, borophene's potential in electrocatalytic water splitting is highlighted, where its abundant active sites facilitate efficient hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions as well as for high‐capacity anodes in lithium‐ion batteries, where storage capacities far exceed those of conventional materials. Though targeting distinct functions, both of these applications rely on shared electrochemical fundamentals and structural design strategies, supporting a unified treatment of borophene's energy applications. Despite promising theoretical and experimental results, challenges in scalable synthesis, stability, and integration persist, highlighting the need for advanced interdisciplinary strategies to fully harness borophene's potential in next‐generation energy conversion and storage applications.

The electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) is a sustainable approach for converting the gas pollutant nitric oxide (NO) into value‐added ammonia (NH 3 ). Currently, electrocatalytic synthesis remains a significant challenge due to the limited understanding of theoretical principles for designing highly active and selective catalysts. Herein, for the first time, hexagonal ZnIn 2 S 4 with a sulfur vacancy (V S ) as a potential NORR catalyst is systematically investigated using first‐principles calculations. The hybridization between 5 p orbital of the indium (In) atom and absorbed NO leads to a strong interaction between the substrate and the adsorbate. The catalyst demonstrates excellent performance with a low limiting potential and prevents the formation of byproducts. Additionally, the hydrogen evolution reaction can be completely inhibited due to the deviation of the proton adsorption from the optimal zero value. Different from conventional d ‐block transitional metal catalysts, here, the exposed p ‐block indium acts catalytically active center for NORR. This work not only highlights a new sustainable catalyst for NORR but also offers an effective strategy for designing novel catalysts.

A feature-driven model, SLEET, built upon the early reported SchNet-bs-RAN framework, that combines the approaches of SchNet and the bond-step representation weighted by the reduced atom number, is reported for evaluating the molecular electronic structure properties of transition-metal complexes (TMCs). Ligands were derived by segmenting purely two-dimensional SMILES representations, and metal-ligand interactions were modeled by using a Transformer-like architecture to construct a property prediction framework that aligns closely with chemical knowledge. This approach effectively captures the characteristics of the ligand field within TMCs. Consequently, the SLEET model delivers precise HOMO-LUMO gap predictions comparable to those achieved by three-dimensional information-based models while also demonstrating strong performance in predicting the molecular-weight-independent electronic properties.

Abstract Implantation of foreign elements into a host lattice can enhance catalytic activity by modulating electronic properties. Copper (Cu), a low‐cost and abundant material, shows great potential in energy conversion applications. However, its high water dissociation energy barrier limits its catalytic performance in alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Herein, a highly scalable co‐electrodeposition method is presented to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of copper for alkaline HER by incorporating rhenium (Re) into the copper lattice. The incorporated Re improves electrocatalytic activity by promoting exothermic water dissociation and enhancing water adsorption. The optimized catalyst, CuRe‐10/CP, achieves an overpotential of 46 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , demonstrating excellent electrochemical stability for 450 h at 50 mA cm −2 in an alkaline medium (1.0 m KOH). Additionally, the electrochemical activity of the CuRe‐10/CP is evaluated in simulated seawater and alkaline seawater, where it exhibited exceptional activity and stability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), electrochemical surface area measurement (ECSA), and turnover frequency (TOF) analyses confirm the significant enhancement in catalytic performance following Re incorporation. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy, EIS, and density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the Re incorporation into the copper lattice significantly improves the water dissociation and intermediate adsorption. This study gives a scalable strategy for designing platinum group element free electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution.

The low‐potential furfural electrooxidation reaction (FFOR) on copper‐based catalysts provides a novel pathway to upgrade biomass and produce H 2 simultaneously on anode. Herein, a series of oxide‐derived copper catalysts (OD‐Cu‐x, x represents electroreduction time) with distinct Cu 0 /Cu + ratios and residual content of lattice oxygen are successfully constructed by tuning in‐situ electroreduction time. When applied for FFOR, the OD‐Cu‐600 with a Cu 0 /Cu + ratio of 83.3% shows the Faradaic efficiency of 96.1% for furoic acid (FA) and 97.4% for H 2 , which can be achieved at a lowest potential of 0.081 V versus RHE at 10 mA cm −2 in continuous 10 cycles, outperforming the state‐of‐art Cu‐based catalysts reported so far. Detailed characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the moderate coverage (25% based on DFT models) of Cu(OH) ads surface species generated by Cu + during the electrooxidation process endows the optimal furfural molecule adsorption and activation. Moreover, this potential‐dependent coverage of surface OH can promote the kinetics of *H transfer to the Cu surface, allowing the H 2 evolution from the anode. The Cu 0 /Cu + ratio (83.8%) and suitable applied potential windows (0 to 0.4 V vs RHE) are both responsible for the co‐production of FA and H 2 with high intrinsic activity and efficient H atom utilization.

Downscaling of metal interconnects has become a bottleneck in the back-end-of-line processing of CMOS semiconductor devices. The conductivity of the commonly used Cu metal drastically reduces at nanoscale, limiting its use as the devices shrink, as the metal starts forming non-conductive islands. This has led to the requirement for new interconnect metals such as Co and Ru, as they have a much higher tendency to form conductive films with horizontal growth at nanoscale. Understanding how the morphology of interconnects depends on the metals' atomistic properties and their interactions at diffusion barrier layers is necessary to continue the rapid development of interconnects. In this study, we have used first-principles density functional theory (DFT) relaxations, ab initio molecular dynamics, and neural network machine learning potentials (MLPs) to investigate how the morphology of Cu, Co, and Ru differs on TaN substrates. We investigate the binding of single metal atoms and four atom clusters to obtain the metals' substrate binding energy and metal-metal interaction energies. The morphology of the metals was then investigated by 15 ps molecular dynamics simulations with DFT and 5 ns with MLPs using larger metal structures that can display 2D and 3D morphologies. Comparing the binding energies with the obtained morphology allows us to demonstrate how the balance of metal-substrate and metal-metal interactions determines the morphology, while the MLP simulations allow longer timescale processes to be included. These insights help in the development of morphology predictors, allowing a rapid method for screening new interconnect materials with targeted horizontal growth on substrates used in semiconductors.

Two-dimensional lead halide perovskites are of significant interest for a variety of practical applications. However, the relationships between their composition and properties are not fully clear. Here we investigated photoluminescence from 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites with different bulky spacer cations. Significant differences in their optical properties and stability are observed, and perovskites with benzylammonium (BZA) and phenethylammonium (PEA) were selected for more detailed investigation of the observed stability differences due to their similar structure. We find that PEA2PbI4 exhibits more narrow emission and increased stability compared to BZA2PbI4. In addition, PEA2PbI4 exhibits self-healing of defects evident from PL enhancement, which is absent for BZA2PbI4. The observed differences between perovskites with BZA and PEA spacer cations can be attributed to differences in the formation of spacer cation vacancies.

ABSTRACT The low‐cost and highly active FeN 4 C single‐atom catalyst is currently one of the most promising oxygen reduction catalysts for replacing the precious metal catalysts in fuel cells. The electron occupation states of Fe 3d orbitals have been proved to play a determining role in the catalytic activity of FeN 4 C. Herein, by adding the second transition‐metal atom M to form FeMN 6 C, we modulate the 3d‐orbital splitting and spin states of Fe to uncover the spin effects on the adsorption energies of oxygen‐containing intermediates and catalytic activity. The results reveal that the introduction of M gives rise to various electron occupation states and magnetic moments of the Fe atom, tuning the catalytic activity of FeN 4 C. Among them, FeRhN 6 C and FePdN 6 C have low theoretical ORR overpotentials of 0.41 and 0.42 V. It is found that there is a volcano relation between the spin moments of Fe and the adsorption energies rather than the linear relation reported in other work.

Oriented electric currents in metals are routinely driven by applying an external electric potential. Although the response of electrons to the external electric fields occurs within attoseconds, conventional electronics do not use this speed potential. Ultrashort laser pulses with controlled shapes of electric fields that switch direction at petahertz frequencies open perspectives for driving currents in metals. Light field-driven currents were demonstrated in various media including dielectrics, semiconductors, and topological insulators. Now, our research question is whether we can drive and control orders of magnitude more charge carriers in metals enabling ultrafast switching with practically low-energy, picojoule-level pulses. Here, we demonstrate the interaction of light with nanometer-thick metallic layers, which leads to a generation of light field-controlled electric currents. We show that the implantation of metallic layers into a dielectric matrix leads to up to 40 times increase of the sensitivity in contrast to a bare dielectric, decreasing the intensity threshold for lightwave electronics.

Ligand strain energy, the energy difference between the bound and unbound conformations of a ligand, is an important component of structure-based small molecule drug design. A large majority of observed ligands in protein-small molecule cocrystal structures bind in low-strain conformations, making strain energy a useful filter for structure-based drug design. In this work we present a tool for calculating ligand strain with a high accuracy. StrainRelief uses a MACE neural network potential (NNP), trained on a large database of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate ligand strain of neutral molecules with quantum accuracy. We show that this tool estimates strain energy differences relative to DFT to within 1.4 kcal/mol, more accurately than alternative NNPs. These results highlight the utility of NNPs in drug discovery, and provide a useful tool for drug discovery teams.

A bidirectional co-doping of transition metal Fe and post-transition metal Sn on WO3 photoanode via a facile one step flame-doping process demonstrates the challenging amelioration of both thermodynamic charge migration and surface catalytic kinetics, achieving high-efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation reaction in a neutral pH. The direct flamethrower with rapid thermal flux effectively induces the bidirectional doping of Fe3+ and Sn4+ into WO3 without damaging its nanostructure and fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate. From the synergetic effect of the dual-metal doping, the photoinduced charge migration and the surface water oxidation kinetics are effectively ameliorated. As a result, the Fe/Sn co-doped WO3 photoanode shows significantly enhanced PEC response with 6.16-fold higher photocurrent density performance at 1.23 VRHE than bare WO3. This work highlights the facile metal atom co-doping method without affecting intrinsic properties of photoanode and substrate for boosting the PEC water splitting performance and solar fuel production.

The development of efficient photocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for coreduction of N2 and CO2 under ambient conditions represents a highly promising but still challenging strategy for sustainable urea synthesis. In this study, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we present a comprehensive descriptor strategy integrating geometric, electronic, and energetic factors to screen Cu-metal dual-atom photocatalysts (CuM/CeO2, where M = 27 transition metals) for urea synthesis. According to the screening of the catalyst stability, coadsorption capability of N2 and CO2, energy barriers of the rate-determining step (RDS), and urea desorption energies, CuMn/CeO2 emerged as the most promising candidate photocatalyst. Through comprehensive analysis of the effects of the Cu-Mn interatomic distance on catalytic performance, a robust volcano-type relationship was established between the energy barrier for the RDS and the formation free energy of the key intermediate NCON (ΔGNCON). This relationship was found to be independent of the support examined in this study.

Slight changes in potassium levels can affect health. Therefore, rapid, reliable, and quantitative determination of potassium ion content is important for medical diagnosis. AlGaN, as a semiconductor material with good biocompatibility, has many advantages in the development of new potassium ion sensors. Understanding the adsorption behavior of a specific ion on the AlGaN surface and the eventual effect on AlGaN/GaN’s heterostructure interface is the key to obtaining high-performance nitride sensors. In this paper, we calculated the changes in the density of states and energy bands of the material after AlGaN adsorbed potassium ions through first-principles simulation. Combined with two-dimensional device simulation software, the changes in device performance caused by the changes in material properties are presented. The simulation results show that the adsorption of a single potassium ion can cause a current change in the order of milliamperes, providing a theoretical reference for the subsequent development of high-sensitivity potassium ion sensors.

Molecular property prediction with limited data in novel chemical domains remains challenging. We introduce an approach based on the hypothesis that prediction difficulty increases systematically with distance from well-characterized regions in an appropriately defined structure-property space. Our framework combines nonlinear structure-property space embedding with distance-aware domain classification and uncertainty quantification. We create a structure-property embedding connecting molecular similarity with prediction difficulty, implement distance-aware classification balancing precision and true positive rate, and provide distance-based uncertainty estimates scaled by molecular similarity. Across four ecotoxicity data sets, our local models reduced root mean squared error by 28-48% for truly in-domain molecules compared to global models, with strong correlations (r = 0.40-0.62) between distance and prediction error. In a biolubricant base oil property application, our approach reduced prediction error by 29% compared to a global model and outperformed transfer learning and standard machine learning approaches. This framework's focus on relevant domains and distance-calibrated uncertainty estimates for limited, heterogeneous chemical data makes it broadly applicable across applications, such as toxicity prediction, drug discovery, and materials design.
