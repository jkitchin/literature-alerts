Non-platinum group metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions were developed using a CoN4 complex with a 14-membered-ring hexaazamacrocyclic ligand (Co-14MR). The carbon-supported Co-14MR catalyst (Co-14MR/C) showed higher ORR and HER activities than a conventional carbon-supported 16-membered-ring Co phthalocyanine (CoPc/C) catalyst. Heat treatment of Co-14MR/C at 600 °C further enhanced its ORR and HER activity through structural modification of the Co active center via deprotonation of ligand amine groups. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the structural modifications of Co-14MR induced by heat treatment adjusted the adsorption energies of important intermediates in the ORR and HER toward optimal values, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. The Co-14MR/C catalysts also exhibited higher durability in the ORR and HER than CoPc/C and Fe-14MR/C catalysts. Structural analysis suggested that the short Co-N bond lengths and small distortion of the CoN4 active site of the Co-14MR catalysts are the reasons for their high durability. These findings suggest that the Co-14MR structure is a promising design for non-platinum group metal catalysts for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells and water splitting.

Abstract High entropy oxides (HEOs) have recently emerged as excellent alternative catalysts that can potentially replace noble metal catalysts such as RuO 2 and IrO 2 for water splitting applications. However, existing methods of synthesizing these catalysts are often tedious. In this work, a straightforward method is proposed using ultra‐fast laser irradiation to synthesize heavily wrinkled noble metal‐free (CoCuFeMnNi) 3 O 4 HEO 2‐D sheets on nickel foam for excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. These sheets facilitate the OER at a low overpotential of only 245 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 and is stable after 100 h of testing. This performance outmatches the majority of recently reported noble and noble metal‐free HEA and HEO catalysts. As an anode in anion exchange water electrolyzer (AEMWE), a remarkably high current density of 1.722 A cm −2 is achieved at 2.0 V with negligible catalyst deterioration despite 70 h of testing. This result outranks the majority of other state‐of‐the‐art AEMWE catalysts reported today. This work proves that laser irradiation synthesis enables the synthesis of efficient HEO catalysts, and is a pioneer synthesis of HEO 2‐D interconnected sheets using laser irradiation. Crucially, this work proves that noble‐metal free HEOs are highly efficient and durable catalysts in industrial AEMWE devices.

Abstract Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis holds promise for green hydrogen production. One of the main challenges is the preparation of highly efficient electrodes with scalable techniques. Herein, a novel Fe‐modulating Raney‐Ni electrode (NFA‐CA) is developed through atmospheric plasma spraying and chemical etching techniques. The resulting electrode demonstrates high bifunctional catalytic activities with low overpotentials and Tafel slopes (HER: 27 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , 20 mV dec −1 ; OER: 169 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , 49 mV dec −1 ), competing for precious‐metal catalysts and leading transition‐metal‐based compounds reported in the literature. Moreover, the corresponding AEM electrolyzer only requires 1.56 V to drive 1 A cm −2 and exceptional durability for 1000 h. Moreover, the AEM cell can reach 2 A cm −2 at 1.79 V, exceeding the United States Department of Energy target for AWE systems (2 A cm −2 at 1.80 V). The highly efficient and durable performance is attributed to the NiFe nanocrystals (core)‐NiFe hydroxide (shell) nanostructures created by the treatment. This structure not only facilitates superior electrocatalytic properties but it is also maintained after 1000 h of continuous operation. It is consider that the present approach can offer an attractive route for scalable fabrication of NiFe‐based electrodes for industrial AEM water electrolyzers.

Stable, nonprecious catalysts are vital for large-scale alkaline water electrolysis. Here, we report a grafted superstructure, MOF@POM, formed by self-assembling a metal-organic framework (MOF) with polyoxometalate (POM). In situ electrochemical transformation converts MOF into active metal (oxy)hydroxides to produce a catalyst with a low overpotential of 178 millivolts at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. An anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporating this catalyst achieves 3 amperes per square centimeter at 1.78 volts at 80°C and stable operation at 2 amperes per square centimeter for 5140 hours at room temperature. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the synergistic interactions between metal atoms create a fast electron-transfer channel from catalytic iron and cobalt sites, nickel, and tungsten in the polyoxometalate to the electrode, stabilizing the metal sites and preventing dissolution.

The graphitized carbon blocks are used as cathode and anode materials on modern aluminum electrolyzers, which provide a reaction interface between molten salts and a graphitized cathode for the electrochemical reaction. The first-principle calculations were performed to clarify the defluorination mechanism of fluoro-aluminates on graphite cathodes in aluminum electrolysis for energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction. The adsorption behaviors of intermediates involved in defluorination reactions on graphite surfaces are analyzed, revealing their spontaneous adsorption based on their adsorption energies and charge density differences. Furthermore, the defluorination pathways of both single Na3AlF6 clusters and fluoride-aluminate polymers are elucidated. Notably, Na3AlF6, after undergoing the thermochemical defluorination process to obtain AlF3, preferentially undergoes electrochemical defluorination via Al-F-Al polymerization. The key findings indicate that the chemical defluorination of Na3AlF6 leading to NaAlF4 serves as a pivotal step, facilitating the overall defluorination process and enhancing the aluminum production efficiency. This work provides fundamental insights into optimizing aluminum electrolysis processes.

Water's ability to autoionize into hydroxide and hydronium ions profoundly influences surface properties, rendering interfaces either basic or acidic. While it is well-established that protons show an affinity to the air-water interface, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and further away from it. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals local polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.

Abstract The stability of a nanoparticle catalyst during electrochemical reaction is crucial for its application. Despite increasing interest in multi-metallic alloy nanoparticles, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs), for electrocatalysis and emerging models for their catalytic activity, there is limited work on frameworks that can predict the metastability of these alloys under reaction conditions, including stability against electrochemical surface dissolution. Incorporating electrochemical stability in multi-objective optimization would advance HEAs as a catalyst discovery platform. To address the knowledge gap on electrochemical stability, we propose a methodology for simulating the dissolution of n-element alloy nanoparticles comprised of density functional theory and machine-learning regression to calculate the dissolution potentials of the surface atoms. We demonstrate the methodology for the Ag–Au–Cu–Ir–Pd–Pt–Rh–Ru HEA system with the conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction. We investigated trends in stability against dissolution through a compositional grid search for the octo-metallic composition space, uncovering two alloying strategies to increase stability against electrochemical surface dissolution: Alloying with a noble metal or a metal with high relative surface energy. In the simulations, stabilization ensues from forming a protective surface layer, and consequently, the dissolution of persistent alloyed nanoparticles results in core–shell structures. The model enables tracing the evolution of the surface and dissolved composition during electrochemical dissolution, forming paths of dissolution and revealing unretainable surface compositions.

Grain boundary chemistry plays a critical role for the properties of metals and alloys, yet there is a lack of consistent datasets for alloy design and development. With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials science, open materials models and datasets can be used to overcome such challenges. Here, we use a universal interatomic potential to compute a grain boundary segregation and embrittlement genome for the Σ5[001](210) grain boundary for FCC and BCC binary alloys. The grain boundary database calculated here serves as a design tool for the embrittlement of high-angle grain boundaries for alloys across 30 base metals of Ag, Al, Au, Ba, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe (both BCC and FCC), Ir, K, Li, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Rb, Rh, Sr, Ta, Ti, V, W, Yb, and Zr with 75 solute elements for each.

Abstract Nickel‐based catalysts are among the most promising materials for electrocatalytic water splitting, particularly for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Their abundance, cost‐effectiveness, and tunable electrochemical properties make them attractive alternatives to precious metal catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the advancements in nickel‐based catalysts, including pure nickel, alloys, oxides, hydroxides, and spinels, emphasizing their synthesis methods, structural properties, and electrocatalytic performance. Recent nanostructuring, doping, and hybridization innovations with conductive supports have significantly enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and efficiency. Despite notable progress, challenges remain in improving long‐term durability, minimizing surface degradation, and scaling up production for industrial applications. Addressing these limitations through advanced catalyst design, in situ characterization, and integration with renewable energy sources will be crucial for widely adopting nickel‐based catalysts in sustainable hydrogen production. This review highlights the key developments and future directions in the field, underscoring the role of nickel‐based materials in enabling the hydrogen economy and global decarbonization efforts.

The activation of CO 2 is essential for efficient electrochemical conversion, yet its weak physisorption on pristine Cu surfaces severely hinders catalytic performance. To overcome this limitation, we designed Cu stepped structures to create highly reactive sites for enhanced CO 2 adsorption and further doped the edges with 3 d transition metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) to improve CO 2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these dopants significantly reduce the OCO angles and elongate the CO bonds, transforming CO 2 from its original linear configuration into a bent geometry at the interface. Notably, dual‐V and dual‐Fe doping on Cu stepped surfaces demonstrates a strong interaction with CO 2 , leading to a high degree of activation. The computational results demonstrate that these modifications significantly enhance CO 2 activation and favor methane generation. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced Cu‐based electrocatalysts for efficient and selective CO 2 activation, offering a pathway toward sustainable CO 2 utilization.

Abstract An innovative palladium‐doped zinc cobalt oxide nanoelectrocatalyst, ZnPd x Co 2‐x O 4 (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.08)@NF, is successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The resulting material exhibits a spinel oxide phase, as confirmed by X‐ray diffraction (XRD). The electrocatalytic performance of ZnPd x Co 2‐x O 4 (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.08)@NF is evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show significant improvements in efficient hydrogen production, with an overpotential of 31 mV, a Tafel slope of 54.36 mV dec⁻ 1 , and sustained stability for over 72 h, using chronopotentiometry methods. Doping with 8.0% Pd concentration enhances the highest electrochemical performance of the nanoelectrocatalyst, supporting the idea that Pd doping improves HER activity. The results suggest that the increased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and faster charge transfer kinetics at the interface between the semiconductor and electrolyte contribute to enhanced performance. The DFT calculations performed in this work confirm the role of Pd in improving the catalytic activity of the ZnCo 2 O 4 spinel catalyst. Overall, this study has made a significant contribution to the development of sustainable energy solutions, offering a promising path toward the efficient production of hydrogen fuel.

The development of stable and efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media remains challenging. This work reports a novel NH3-assisted pyrolysis strategy to synthesize Co-N4 SACs with controlled nitrogen coordination environments on crumpled graphene supports. The pyrrolic N4-coordinated Co sites demonstrate superior OER activity compared to their pyridinic counterparts, achieving an overpotential of 351 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 m H2SO4. Combined density functional theory calculations and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that the pyrrolic coordination environment facilitates enhanced OH- adsorption and subsequent OER kinetics due to its unique electronic structure and geometric flexibility. A multi-layered protective mechanism in the pyrrolic system enables exceptional stability during long-term acidic OER operation, stemming from higher defect formation energy of Co sites and strategic distribution of sacrificial nitrogen species in the graphene network. These findings provide fundamental insights into designing stable single-atom catalysts for challenging electrochemical applications.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of forever synthetic chemicals. They are widely utilized in industries and household appliances because of their remarkable stability and distinctive oil- and water-repellent properties. Despite their broad applications, unfortunately, PFAS are hazardous to all forms of life, including humans. In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS has raised significant interest in degrading these substances. However, the strong C-F bonds in these chemicals pose several challenges to their degradation. Plasmons of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) offer many exciting applications, including photocatalytic reactions. However, an atomistic understanding of plasmon-driven processes remains elusive. In this work, using the real-time time-dependent density functional theory, we have studied the real-time formation of plasmons, hot-carrier generation, and subsequent direct hot-carrier transfer from metal NPs to the PFAS. Our simulations show that there is an apparent direct hot-electron transfer from NPs to PFAS. Moreover, using Ehrenfest dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that the transferred hot electrons can efficiently degrade PFAS without requiring any external thermal bath. Thus, our work provides an atomistic picture of plasmon-induced direct hot-carrier transfer from NPs to PFAS and the efficient degradation of PFAS. We strongly believe that this work generates the impetus to utilize plasmonic NPs to mitigate PFAS.

The electron density is an important object in quantum chemistry that is crucial for many downstream tasks in drug design. Recent deep learning approaches predict the electron density around a molecule from atom types and atom positions. Most of these methods use the plane wave (PW) numerical method as a source of ground-truth training data. However, the drug design field mostly uses the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) for computation of quantum properties. In this study, we focus on prediction of the electron density for drug-like substances and training neural networks with LCAO-based datasets. Our experiments show that proper handling of large amplitudes of core orbitals is crucial for training on LCAO-based data. We propose to store the electron density with the standard grids instead of the uniform grid. This allowed us to reduce the number of probing points per molecule by 43 times and reduce storage space requirements by 8 times. Finally, we propose a novel architecture based on the DeepDFT model that we name LAGNet. It is specifically designed and tuned for drug-like substances and ∇2 DFT dataset.

Machine learning and automation are transforming scientific research, yet the implementation of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) remains costly and complex, and it remains difficult to learn how to use these facilities. To address this, we introduce Claude-Light, a lightweight, remotely accessible instrument designed for prototyping automation algorithms and machine learning workflows. Claude-Light integrates a REST API, a Raspberry Pi-based control system, and an RGB LED with a photometer that measures ten spectral outputs, providing a controlled but realistic experimental environment. This device enables users to explore automation at multiple levels, from basic programming and experimental design to machine learning-driven optimization. We demonstrate the application of Claude-Light in structured automation approaches, including traditional scripting, statistical design of experiments, and active learning methods. In addition, we explore the role of large language models (LLMs) in laboratory automation, highlighting their use in instrument selection, structured data extraction, function calling, and code generation. While LLMs present new opportunities for streamlining automation, they also introduce challenges related to reproducibility, security, and reliability. We discuss strategies to mitigate these risks while leveraging LLMs for enhanced efficiency in self-driving laboratories. Claude-Light provides a practical and accessible platform for students and researchers to develop automation skills and test algorithms before deploying them in larger-scale SDLs. By lowering the barrier to entry for automation in scientific research, this tool facilitates broader adoption of AI-driven experimentation and fosters innovation in autonomous laboratories.
