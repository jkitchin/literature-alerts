The diversity of chemical environments present on unique crystallographic facets can drive dramatic differences in catalytic activity and the reaction mechanism. By coupling experimental investigations of five different IrO2 facets and theory, we characterize the detailed elemental steps of the surface redox processes and the rate-limiting processes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The predicted complex evolution of surface adsorbates and the associated charge transfer as a function of applied potential matches well with the distinct redox features observed experimentally for the five facets. Our microkinetic model from grand canonical quantum mechanics (GC-QM) calculations demonstrates mechanistic differences between nucleophilic attack and O–O coupling across facets, providing the rates as a function of applied potential. These GC-QM calculations explain the higher OER activity observed on the (100), (001), and (110) facets and the lower activity observed for the (101) and (111) facets. This combined study with theory and experiment brings new insights into the structural features that either promote or hinder the OER activity of IrO2, which are expected to provide parallels in structural effects on other oxide surfaces.

Semiconductor-based materials utilized in photocatalysts and electrocatalysts present a sophisticated solution for efficient solar energy utilization and bias control, a field extensively explored for its potential in sustainable energy and environmental management. Recently, 3D printing has emerged as a transformative technology, offering rapid, cost-efficient, and highly customizable approaches to designing photocatalysts and electrocatalysts with precise structural control and tailored substrates. The adaptability and precision of printing facilitate seamless integration, loading, and blending of diverse photo(electro)catalytic materials during the printing process, significantly reducing material loss compared to traditional methods. Despite the evident advantages of 3D printing, a comprehensive compendium delineating its application in the realm of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is conspicuously absent. This paper initiates by delving into the fundamental principles and mechanisms underpinning photocatalysts electrocatalysts and 3D printing. Subsequently, an exhaustive overview of the latest 3D printing techniques, underscoring their pivotal role in shaping the landscape of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts for energy and environmental applications. Furthermore, the paper examines various methodologies for seamlessly incorporating catalysts into 3D printed substrates, elucidating the consequential effects of catalyst deposition on catalytic properties. Finally, the paper thoroughly discusses the challenges that necessitate focused attention and resolution for future advancements in this domain.

The Fe-embedded N-doped graphene (Fe–N–C) is the most representative single atom catalyst (SAC) that has shown great potentiality in electrocatalysis, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the active moiety of Fe–N–C is still elusive due to contradictory experimental results. Moreover, early simulations mainly focus on the thermodynamic potential of adsorbates, while the effect of spin multiplicity receives little attention. To explore the role of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis, we employ the constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) to systematically study the structural evolution of the high-spin (HS) and intermediate-spin (IS) FeN4 site (marked by FeN4HS/IS) in OER and ORR processes. With the consideration of spin multiplicity, our simulation shows spontaneous oxidation from Fe(II)N4IS to Fe(III)N4HS at potential U = 0.4 V versus SHE. Further simulation indicates that the FeN4IS site undergoes a sequential adsorption of *OH and *OOH along with U increase, which leads to the spin state transition from IS to HS. According to the constant-potential free energy analysis, the FeN4HS*OOH is confirmed to be the practical active centers of OER, while the FeN4HS*OH and FeN4IS are assigned to the active center of ORR in low and high overpotentials. The predicted ORR activity of FeN4HS*OH agrees with the in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy measurement by Xiao et al. [Microporous Framework Induced Synthesis of Single-Atom Dispersed Fe-NC Acidic ORR Catalyst and its In Situ Reduced Fe-N4 Active Site Identification Revealed by X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy. ACS Catal. 2018, 8, 2824–2832]. Based on the geometry and orbital analysis, the bond length of Fe–N and coordination number of Fe center are found to have a significant impact on the d orbital splitting energy and thus induce the turnover of HS/IS stability in the OER/ORR intermediates. Our study brings comprehensive insights into the evolution of coordination and spin state in Fe–N–C, which reveals the significance of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis and benefits further theoretical design of SACs from the perspective of spin effects.

Currently, electrochemical water-splitting activity is limited by the slow intrinsic reaction kinetics and energy conversion efficiency, so designing highly efficient electrocatalysts that can facilitate electrochemical reactions remains necessary. Herein, the catalyst architecture consisting of Fe-doped CoS2 nanocages with nitrogen-doped carbon wrapping (CN/Fe-CoS2) was explored as an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst. Through density functional theory calculations, the introduction of Fe into CoS2 would modulate the density of states, making the reduced band gap and enhanced intrinsic charge transfer efficiency of CoS2. Simultaneously, the adsorption of intermediates during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes is regulated, leading to an improvement in the intrinsic catalytic activity. The experimental results demonstrate that Fe doping significantly enhances the electron transfer, specific surface area, and electrochemical active area of CoS2, which facilitates the efficient utilization of charge and exposes additional active sites for electrochemical reactions. In addition, the nanocage architecture and nitrogen-doped carbon wrapping in CN/Fe-CoS2 act as a protective layer to prevent CoS2 aggregation, thereby exposing additional active sites and enhancing the interface with the electrolyte. By optimizing the amount of Fe, CN/Fe-CoS2 demonstrates a remarkably superior electrocatalytic performance and stability, as evidenced by the low overpotential (η10) of 186 and 304 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm–2 in 1.0 M KOH media for HER and OER, respectively. Overall, combining heteroatom doping and structure designing represents a promising approach to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Carbon nitrides are commonly employed as substrates to anchor single metal atoms. Numerous theoretical studies have previously characterized these single-atom systems using the pristine g-C3N4 structure, featuring a C6N7 motif. However, the relatively large pores in g-C3N4 may not effectively coordinate with metal cations, resulting in discordance with the coordination environment determined by experimental characterization. In this study, we introduce a novel model denoted as CN-N4, which preserves the essential g-C3N4 motif, while offering four nitrogen sites for metal binding. Compared with g-C3N4, the binding affinity between the metal and this new substrate model is significantly enhanced, similar to that of a commonly studied nitrogen-doped graphene model (N-gra). Additionally, we have assessed the catalytic performance in various reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CN-N4-supported system exhibits activity comparable to that of the corresponding N-gra-supported species. Fe- and Co-centered SACs can be promising catalysts for ORR, and relatively stable Cu-g-C3N4 is active to HER and CO2RR, consistent with reported experiments. In addition, V-CN-N4 and Rh-CN-N4 are predicted to be candidates to catalyze the HER and ORR, respectively. We suggest that the CN-N4 model aptly captures the local structure of carbon nitride-based materials with a high coordination number, providing an alternative foundation for investigating the reaction mechanisms of these single-atom catalysts.

The coordination engineering of Fe–N–C single-atom catalysts (SACs) through introducing heteroatom dopants has attracted widespread attention in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the common regularity for tuning the ORR activity by coordinated and environmental heteroatoms has not been sufficiently studied. Herein, we study the ORR activity on 100 Fe–N–C SACs with S, P, and B heteroatoms in diverse coordination shells by density functional theory calculations. Based on the energy level distribution of frontier orbits and molecular orbital theory, it is found that the origin of Fe–N–C ORR activity is the hybridization of molecular orbitals of Fe 3dz2, 3dyz (3dxz), and O2*/OH* intermediates, where hybrid orbitals are adjusted by coordinated and environmental S, P, and B heteroatoms, and then the protonation process of O2* or OH* intermediate is determined. Moreover, we found that the Fe–O bond length, the d-orbital gap of spin states, the d-orbital center, and the valence state of the Fe site can be used as structural descriptors to predict the ORR activity governed by the protonation of O2* or OH* intermediate as potential-determining steps. Our structural descriptors rationalize the superior ORR performance of Fe–N–C with S or B atoms doped in the second coordination shell to those in the first coordination shell, as well as the fact that the P heteroatom is more suitable as a coordinated atom than the environmental atom to enhance the ORR activity of Fe–N–C, in available experimental references. Thanks to structural descriptors, the codoping synergistic effect between P in the first coordination shell and S in the second coordination shell is predicted and confirmed to greatly enhance the ORR activity. This study provides a unified mechanistic understanding on the ORR activity trend among Fe–N–C SACs regulated by coordinated and environmental heteroatoms.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key for the transition to a hydrogen-based energy economy. The observed activity of the OER catalysts arises from the combined effects of surface area, intrinsic activity, and stability. Therefore, alloys provide an effective platform to search for catalysts that balance these factors. In particular, high-entropy oxides provide a vast material composition space that could contain catalysts with optimal OER performance. In this work, the OER performance of the AuIrOsPdPtReRhRu composition space was modeled using an experimentally obtained dataset of 350 nanoparticles. This machine-learned model based on experimental data found the optimal catalyst to be a mixture of AuIrOsPdRu. However, as a "black-box model", it cannot explain the underlying chemistry. Therefore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to provide a complementary theoretical model with defined assumptions and, hence, a physical interpretation through comparison with the experimental model. The DFT calculations suggest that the majority of the activity originates from Ru and Ir active sites and that the addition of Pd improves the performance of these sites. However, the DFT calculation did not find the experimentally observed beneficial effects of Au and Os. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Os contributed to the performance of the tested catalysts by roughening the surface, whereas Au fulfilled the role of a structural support. Overall, it is demonstrated how machine learning can help accelerate catalyst discovery, and combining machine-learned models obtained from experimental data with models based on DFT calculations can provide important insights into the complex chemistry of OER catalysts.

Inspired by the distinctive structural and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we conducted comprehensive high-throughput first-principles computations to screen stable 2D chalcogenides X2T (X = transition metals Sc–Hg, totally 29 and main group elements Li–Ba, totally 37; T = S, Se, and Te) with anti-MoS2 configurations in both 1T and 2H phases. Among 396 evaluated candidates, the selected X2T monolayers (X = Sc, Fe, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, IA elements Li–Fr, IIA elements Ca–Ra, N, In, Tl, and Te; T = S, Se, or Te) demonstrate outstanding thermodynamic, dynamic, mechanical properties, and thermal stabilities in 1T/1T′ or 2H phases. These anti-MoS2 variants exhibit diverse characteristics, serving as nonmagnetic/magnetic metals or nonmagnetic/antiferromagnetic semiconductors, often surpassing MoS2 in Young's modulus and/or displaying negative Poisson's ratios. Transition-metal-based monolayers show susceptibility to O2 oxidization, and some show high N2 dissociation activity. Oxygen/nitrogen-terminations can quench TM magnetism and increase band-gaps over their pristine counterparts. Notably, the 2H-Fe2S monolayer maintains robust antiferromagnetism upon O-termination. Moreover, TM-based X2T sheets demonstrate promise as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions. This study expands the diversity of 2D materials with new members and novel functional properties and broadens their potential applications.

Stretching or compression can induce significant energetic, geometric, and spectroscopic changes in materials. To fully exploit these effects in the design of mechano- or piezo-chromic materials, self-healing polymers, and other mechanoresponsive devices, a detailed knowledge about the distribution of mechanical strain in the material is essential. Within the past decade, Judgement of Energy DIstribution (JEDI) analysis has emerged as a useful tool for this purpose. Based on the harmonic approximation, the strain energy in each bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle of the deformed system is calculated using quantum chemical methods. This allows the identification of the force-bearing scaffold of the system, leading to an understanding of mechanochemical processes at the most fundamental level. Here, we present a publicly available code that generalizes the JEDI analysis, which has previously only been available for isolated molecules. Now, the code has been extended to two- and three-dimensional periodic systems, supramolecular clusters, and substructures of chemical systems under various types of deformation. Due to the implementation of JEDI into the Atomic Simulation Environment, the JEDI analysis can be interfaced with a plethora of program packages that allow the calculation of electronic energies for molecular systems and systems with periodic boundary conditions. The automated generation of a color-coded three-dimensional structure via the Visual Molecular Dynamics program allows insightful visual analyses of the force-bearing scaffold of the strained system.

ReaxFF is a computationally efficient model for reactive molecular dynamics simulations, which has been applied to a wide variety of chemical systems. When ReaxFF parameters are not yet available for a chemistry of interest, they must be (re)optimized, for which one defines a set of training data that the new ReaxFF parameters should reproduce. ReaxFF training sets typically contain diverse properties with different units, some of which are more abundant (by orders of magnitude) than others. To find the best parameters, one conventionally minimizes a weighted sum of squared errors over all data in the training set. One of the challenges in such numerical optimizations is to assign weights so that the optimized parameters represent a good compromise between all the requirements defined in the training set. This work introduces a new loss function, called Balanced Loss, and a workflow that replaces weight assignment with a more manageable procedure. The training data is divided into categories with corresponding "tolerances", i.e. acceptable root-mean-square errors for the categories, which define the expectations for the optimized ReaxFF parameters. Through the Log-Sum-Exp form of Balanced Loss, the parameter optimization is also a validation of one's expectations, providing meaningful feedback that can be used to reconfigure the tolerances if needed. The new methodology is demonstrated with a non-trivial parameterization of ReaxFF for water adsorption on alumina. This results in a new force field that reproduces both rare and frequent properties of a validation set not used for training. We also demonstrate the robustness of the new force field with a molecular dynamics simulation of water desorption from a $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ slab model.

Abstract The creation of metal‐metal oxide interfaces is an important approach to fine‐tuning catalyst properties through strong interfacial interactions. This article presents the work on developing interfaces between Pt and CeO x that improve Pt surface energetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) within an alkaline electrolyte. The Pt‐CeO x interfaces are formed by depositing size‐controlled Pt nanoparticles onto a carbon support already coated with ultrathin CeO x nanosheets. This interface structure facilitates substantial electron transfer from Pt to CeO x , resulting in decreased hydrogen binding energies on Pt surfaces, and water dissociation for the HER, as predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Electrochemical testing indicates that both Pt specific activity and mass activity are improved by a factor of 2 to 3 following the formation of Pt‐CeO x interfaces. This study underscores the significance and potential of harnessing robust interfacial effects to enhance electrocatalytic reactions.

This research aims to analyze the techno-economic and environmental aspects of retrofitting carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on the existing 330 MWe pulverized coal (PC) power plant. Modeling simulations on existing PC and retrofitting PC CCS with variations in biomass co-firing (wood pellet) were carried out using the Integrated Environment Control Model (IECM) version 11.5 software. An amine-based post-combustion capture was used in this study. Coal and biomass co-firing at PC CCS reduce the net power output and thermal efficiency. Carbon neutrality occurs at 10% biomass co-firing on PC CCS. There was a 164% increase in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), from 0.0487 USD/kWh on PC to 0.1287 USD/kWh on PC CCS. A sensitivity analysis of fuel prices shows that at a fuel price of 25 USD/t, the LCOE of PC CCS is 0.0953 USD/kWh or higher than Indonesia’s national weighted LCOE of 0.0705 USD/kWh. The LCOE of PC CCS can be lower than the national weighted LCOE when the carbon price is higher than 80 USD/t CO2.

The investigation of defects in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are of capital interest for future applications because they strongly change the optical, electronic, or vibrational properties of such materials. In this sense, spectroscopic techniques, such as Raman and photoluminescence, are powerful tools to investigate the optoelectronic properties of crystal defects in two-dimensional TMDs. In this work, we observed that defect-activated Raman modes and bound exciton emissions can be strongly correlated. Specifically, we investigated the impact that sulfur vacancies, produced by focused helium ion beam, have on the electronic and phononic properties of WS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition. The photoluminescence spectra show two new emission peaks related to defects in the crystal structure. The defective nature of these bands were corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which showed new electronic states in the band gap associated with sulfur vacancies. Furthermore, by monitoring the evolution of the Raman spectra as a function of the defect concentration, we observed two new defect activated modes. These bands are explained by a second-order double resonant Raman process, similar to the D band of graphene. Finally, we found out that the defect-related Raman peaks become fully resonant for high defect concentrations. It turns out that degenerate electronic states split in two separated levels for high defect concentrations that are involved in the resonance of the Raman processes.

Abstract Green hydrogen production is crucial for a sustainable future, but current catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffer from slow kinetics, despite many efforts to produce optimal designs, particularly through the calculation of descriptors for activity. In this study, we develop a dataset of density functional theory calculations of bulk and surface perovskite oxides, and adsorption energies of OER intermediates, which includes compositions up to quaternary and facets up to (555). We demonstrate that per-site properties of perovskite oxides such as Bader charge or band center can be tuned through element substitution and faceting, and develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts these properties directly from the local chemical environment. We leverage these per-site properties to identify promising perovskites with high theoretical OER activity. The identified design principles and promising materials provide a roadmap for closing the gap between current artificial catalysts and biological enzymes such as photosystem II.

Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction in aqueous electrolytes is a promising route to produce added-value chemicals and decrease carbon emissions. However, even in Gas-Diffusion Electrode devices, low aqueous CO 2 solubility limits catalysis rate and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that when assembled over a heterogeneous electrocatalyst, a film of nitrile-modified Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) acts as a remarkable CO 2 -solvation layer that increases its local concentration by ~27-fold compared to bulk electrolyte, reaching 0.82 M. When mounted on a Bi catalyst in a Gas Diffusion Electrode, the MOF drastically improves CO 2 -to-HCOOH conversion, reaching above 90% selectivity and partial HCOOH currents of 166 mA/cm 2 (at −0.9 V vs RHE). The MOF also facilitates catalysis through stabilization of reaction intermediates, as identified by operando infrared spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory. Hence, the presented strategy provides new molecular means to enhance heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction, leading it closer to the requirements for practical implementation.

Industrialization over the past two centuries has resulted in a continuous rise in global CO2 emissions. These emissions are changing ecosystems and livelihoods. Therefore, methods are needed to capture these emissions from point sources and possibly from our atmosphere. Though the amount of CO2 is rising, it is challenging to capture directly from air because its concentration in air is extremely low, 0.04%. In this study, amines installed inside metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are investigated for the adsorption of CO2, including at low concentrations. The amines used are polyamidoamine dendrimers that contain many primary amines. Chemically reversible adsorption of CO2 via carbamate formation was observed, as was enhanced uptake of carbon dioxide, likely via dendrimer-amide-based physisorption. Limiting factors in this initial study are comparatively low dendrimer loadings and slow kinetics for carbon dioxide uptake and release, even at 80 °C.

Abstract The proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE), crucial for green hydrogen production, is challenged by the scarcity and high cost of iridium‐based materials. Cobalt oxides, as ideal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), have not been extensively applied in PEMWE, due to extremely high voltage and poor stability at large current density, caused by complicated structural variations of cobalt compounds during the OER process. Thus, the authors sought to introduce chromium into a cobalt spinel (Co 3 O 4 ) catalyst to regulate the electronic structure of cobalt, exhibiting a higher oxidation state and increased Co–O covalency with a stable structure. In‐depth operando characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the activated Co–O covalency and adaptable redox behavior are crucial for facilitating its OER activity. Both turnover frequency and mass activity of Cr‐doped Co 3 O 4 (CoCr) at 1.67 V (vs RHE) increased by over eight times than those of as‐synthesized Co 3 O 4 . The obtained CoCr catalyst achieved 1500 mA cm −2 at 2.17 V and exhibited notable durability over extended operation periods – over 100 h at 500 mA cm −2 and 500 h at 100 mA cm −2 , demonstrating promising application in the PEMWE industry.

Cobalt nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-NC) catalysts are synthesized for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via the pyrolysis of zinc-mediated and SiO2-templated 2,6-diaminopyridine (DAP) composites. The resulting Co-NC(Zn12-SiO2[20])-900 demonstrates exceptional ORR activities, with half-wave and onset potentials of 0.835 V and 0.875 V, respectively, which is similar to Pt/C catalyst. In long-term durability test, the Co-NC(Zn12-SiO2[20])-900 catalyst exhibits a negligible E1/2 shift, and in methanol tolerance tests, it displays significantly better performance than commercial Pt/C catalyst. The superior performance can be attributed to the hierarchical porous structure, dense and highly accessible Co-N4 and graphitic nitrogen (g-N) sites. The high content of Co-N4 and g-N sites enhances 3d-orbital filling and reduces the Co centers' on-site magnetic moment, as calculated by density functional theory. This may lead to a decrease in the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS), which in turn enhances the intrinsic activity of the ORR.

Electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices support a promising green, efficient renewable way to solve energy-supply shortages and environmental problems. To promote reaction rates of involved electrochemical reactions, non-metal or noble metal electrocatalysts are elaborately designed. For optimizing the intrinsic structure and decreasing the cost, functional carbon dots (CDs) are chosen to add into these metal or metal-free materials, benefitting from their unique advantages of abundant surface functional groups, excellent electron acceptor/donor properties and high specific surface area. This review aims to support a summary of recent breakthrough in the application of CDs to regulate intrinsic structure of metal or metal-free materials including dispersibility, utilization efficiency, electronic state, partial charge distribution, and coordination environment of active atom-sites. Moreover, electrocatalytic performances (including stability, conductivity and antitoxicity, etc.) are also systematically investigated. Except that, the potential opportunities and challenges for application of CDs-based materials in the future are also discussed to promote the development of this field.

It is technically challenging to quantitatively apply strains to tune catalysis because most heterogeneous catalysts are nanoparticles, and lattice strains can only be applied indirectly via core–shell structures or crystal defects. Herein, we report quantitative relations between macroscopic strains and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities of dealloyed nanoporous gold (NPG) by directly applying macroscopic strains upon bulk NPG. It was found that macroscopic compressive strains lead to a decrease, while macroscopic tensile strains improve the HER activity of NPG, which is in line with the d-band center model. The overpotential and onset potential of HER display approximately a linear relation with applied macroscopic strains, revealing an ∼2.9 meV decrease of the binding energy per 0.1% lattice strains from compressive to tensile. The methodology with the high strain sensitivity of electrocatalysis, developed in this study, paves a new way to investigate the insights of strain-dependent electrocatalysis with high precision.

Heterostructure catalysts are considered as promising candidates for promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process due to their strong electron coupling. However, the inevitable dissolution and detachment of the heterostructure catalysts are caused by the severe reconstruction, dramatically limiting their industrial application. Herein, the NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets attached on Mo-NiO microrods (Mo-NiO@NiFe LDH) by the preoxidation strategy of the core NiMoN layer are synthesized for ensuring the high catalytic performance and stability. Owing to the enhanced electron coupling and preoxidation process, the obtained Mo-NiO@NiFe LDH exhibits a superlow overpotential of 253 mV to achieve a practically relevant current density of 1000 mA cm–2 for OER with exceptional stability over 1200 h. Notably, the overall water splitting system based on Mo-NiO@NiFe LDH reveals remarkable stability, maintaining the catalytic activity at a current density of 1000 mA cm–2 for 140 h under industrial harsh conditions. Furthermore, the Mo-NiO@NiFe LDH demonstrates outstanding activity and long-term durability in a practical alkaline electrolyzer assembly with a porous membrane, even surpassing the performance of IrO2. This work provides a new sight for designing and synthesizing highly stable heterojunction electrocatalysts, further promoting and realizing the industrial electrocatalytic OER.

The complex interplay between local chemistry, the solvent microenvironment, and electrified interfaces frequently present in electrocatalytic reactions has motivated the development of quantum chemical methods that can accurately model these effects. Here, we predict the thermodynamics of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at sulfur vacancies in 1T′-phase MoS2 and highlight how the realistic treatment of potential within grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) seamlessly captures the multiple competing effects of applied potential on a catalyst interface interacting with solvated molecules. In the canonical approach, the computational hydrogen electrode is widely used and predicts that adsorbed N2 structure properties are potential-independent. In contrast, GC-DFT calculations show that reductive potentials activate N2 toward electroreduction by controlling its back-bonding strength and lengthening the N–N triple bond while decreasing its bond order. Similar trends are observed for another classic back-bonding ligand in CO, suggesting that this mechanism may be broadly relevant to other electrochemistries involving back-bonded adsorbates. Furthermore, reductive potentials are required to make the subsequent N2 hydrogenation steps favorable but simultaneously destabilizes the N2 adsorbed structure resulting in a trade-off between the favorability of N2 adsorption and the subsequent reaction steps. We show that GC-DFT facilitates modeling all these phenomena and that together they can have important implications in predicting electrocatalyst selectivity for the NRR and potentially other reactions.

In this work, we propose and validate a generalization of the Helmholtz model that can account for both “bell-shaped” and “camel-shaped” differential capacitance profiles of concentrated electrolytes, the latter being characteristic of ionic liquids. The generalization is based on introducing voltage dependence of both the dielectric constant “ϵr(V)” and thickness “L(V)” of the inner Helmholtz layer, as validated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We utilize MD simulations to study the capacitance profiles of three different electrochemical interfaces: (1) graphite/[BMIm+][BF4−] ionic liquid interface; (2) Au(100)/[BMIm+][BF4−] ionic liquid interface; (3) Au(100)/1M [Na+][Cl−] aqueous interface. We compute the voltage dependence of ϵr(V) and L(V) and demonstrate that the generalized Helmholtz model qualitatively describes both camel-shaped and bell-shaped differential capacitance profiles of ionic liquids and concentrated aqueous electrolytes (in lieu of specific ion adsorption). In particular, the camel-shaped capacitance profile that is characteristic of ionic liquid electrolytes arises simply from combination of the voltage-dependent trends of ϵr(V) and L(V). Furthermore, explicit analysis of the inner layer charge density for both concentrated aqueous and ionic liquid double layers reveal similarities, with these charge distributions typically exhibiting a dipolar region closest to the electrode followed by a monopolar peak at larger distances. It is appealing that a generalized Helmholtz model can provide a unified description of the inner layer structure and capacitance profile for seemingly disparate aqueous and ionic liquid electrolytes.

Improving the hydrogen storage performance of carbon-based materials via transition metals incorporation has been proved experimentally, where control over the hydrogen adsorption kinetics and hydrogen surface diffusion is the key. In this work, we proved theoretically via density functional theory (DFT) how such incorporation promotes better hydrogen storage performance in Ni-based materials supported on graphene, in which static and dynamic behavior of the system were modeled by plane-wave DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), respectively. In addition, the hydrogen storage materials Ni10Al3 and Ni13 supported on graphene, denoted as Ni10Al3/GP and Ni13/GP, are modeled to realize the experimental observation on Ni3Al alloy under high hydrogen pressure. It was found that the Ni10Al3/GP alloy system exhibited better properties in twofold: (1) increased hydrogen adsorption capacity through providing an additional site for H2 molecular adsorption, particularly on the Al atoms, and (2) enhanced hydrogen desorption at ambient conditions observed from reversible H2 adsorption at all coverages with barrierless migration energy. Therefore, the proof from the DFT point-of-view provides valuable insight into exploring other metal alloy systems that can provide additional sites for molecular hydrogen adsorption and improve hydrogen adsorbate mobility.

The interaction of a titanium carbide nanoparticle with aluminum (100), (110), and (111) substrates is investigated within the density functional theory. The nanoparticle–substrate interaction energies are determined; the electron density distribution and the electron localization function between aluminum, titanium, and carbon atoms are analyzed. It has been established that the atoms in the upper layers of the aluminum (100) and (110) substrates are significantly displaced relative to their initial positions as a result of the interaction with the nanoparticle, whereas a minor displacement of atoms is typical for the (111) substrate. The interaction between aluminum and carbon atoms at the Al–TiC interface is due to the formation of covalent Al–C chemical bonds. The aluminum atoms forming carbide bonds do not form chemical bonds with titanium atoms. The aluminum atoms that are adjacent to the titanium atoms and are not involved in the formation of carbide bonds form metallic Al–Ti bonds.

С помощью DFT-моделирования рассчитаны профили свободной энергии реакции восстановления кислорода в кислотной и щелочной средах на поверхности допированного азотом графена в сравнении с бездефектным графеном. Рассмотрены как четырех-, так и двухэлектронный ассоциативный механизм реакции. Расчеты выполнены в большом каноническом ансамбле при фиксированном потенциале электрода. Показано, что расчеты при фиксированном потенциале дают существенное отличие от общепринятого расчета при фиксированном заряде поверхности. Обнаружено, что электрокаталитическое действие азотной примеси связано с ростом энергии хемосорбции интермедиата OOH, что снижает энергию реакции протонирования молекулы кислорода. Также показано, что в щелочной среде азотная примесь ингибирует двухэлектронный механизм реакции.

С использованием метода циклической вольтамперометрии (ЦВА) впервые изучены и описаны электрохимические свойства N-замещенных солей 2,2'-бипиридина – N-метил-2,2'-бипиридиния иодида и N,N'-диметил-2,2'-бипиридиния иодида. Показано, что метильные заместители у атома азота в молекуле орто -бипиридина оказывают сильное влияние на электрохимические свойства. Для N,N'-диметил-2,2'-бипиридиния иодида были рассчитаны значения константы конпропорционирования, что позволило сделать вывод о степени локализации электрона в исследуемых системах.

The PtCo/C electrocatalyst obtained by the method of simultaneous reduction of metal precursors using sodium borohydride was treated at a temperature of 350 ˚C in an argon atmosphere for 1 hour. The results of X-ray phase analysis and transmission electron microscopy indicate an increase in the average size of crystallites and the formation of nanoparticle agglomerates after heat treatment. The shift in the reflection of Pt (111) after treatment indicates the possible segregation of metal components during the heating of the sample. An increase in the catalyst activity after heat treatment is shown, both mass activity and specific activity. The stability of the sample after heat treatment, according to the results of the stress test in the potential range of 0.6–1.4 V, showed a higher value than the material in the “as prepared” state.

The development of highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on more cost-effective and earth-abundant elements is of great significance and still faces a huge challenge. In this work, a series of transition metal (TM) embedding a newly-defined monolayer carbon nitride phase is theoretically profiled and constructed as a catalytic platform for OER studies. Typically, a four-step screening strategy was proposed to rapidly identified high performance candidates and the coordination structure and catalytic performance relationship was thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the eliminating criterion was established to condenses valid range based on the Gibbs free energy of OH*. Our results reveal that the as-constructed 2FeCN/P exhibits superior activity toward OER with an ultralow overpotential of 0.25 V, at the same time, the established 3FeCN/S configuration performed well as a bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysis with extremely low overpotential ηOER/ηORR of 0.26/0.48 V. Overall, this work provides an effective framework for screening advanced OER catalysts, which can also be extended to other complex multistep catalytic reactions.
