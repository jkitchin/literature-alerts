To overcome the limitations of conventional bimetallic catalysts in facilitating the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we employed density functional theory (DFT) screening to evaluate ternary Pd3X@Pt core@shell catalysts (X = transition metals), with the objective of increasing both the ORR activity and durability. Among the 25 candidates, Pd3Mo@Pt emerges as the most promising catalyst, showing a combination of a low limiting potential and a high dissolution potential. Experimental validation reveals that the carbon-supported Pd3Mo@Pt/C catalysts clearly exhibit exceptional mass activity (3.76 A mgPt-1) and specific activity (1.67 mA cm-2); these activities significantly surpass those of their Pt/C counterparts by factors of 10.2 and 3.18, respectively. Furthermore, these core@shell catalysts exhibit robust durability, while also exhibiting enhanced CO tolerance, as evidenced by CO stripping voltammetry. DFT calculations show that the superior activity and stability of Pd3Mo@Pt/C are attributed to the optimal modulation of the Pt surface electronic structures by the core elements, particularly Mo.

Developing advanced catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable hydrogen production. This study presents a multistage machine learning (ML) approach to streamline the discovery and optimization of complex multimetallic catalysts. Our method integrates data mining, active learning, and domain adaptation throughout the materials discovery process. Unlike traditional trial-and-error methods, this approach systematically narrows the exploration space using domain knowledge with minimized reliance on subjective intuition. Then, the active learning module efficiently refines element composition and synthesis conditions through iterative experimental feedback. The process culminated in the discovery of a promising Ru-Mn-Ca-Pr oxide catalyst. Our workflow also enhances theoretical simulations with domain adaptation strategy, providing deeper mechanistic insights aligned with experimental findings. By leveraging diverse data sources and multiple ML strategies, we demonstrate an efficient pathway for electrocatalyst discovery and optimization. This comprehensive, data-driven approach represents a paradigm shift and potentially benchmark in electrocatalysts research.

RuO2 with high intrinsic activity for water oxidation is a promising alternative to IrO2 in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, but it suffers from long-term stability issues due to overoxidation. Here, we report a sub-4 nm Ru-RuO2 Schottky nanojunction (Ru-RuO2-SN) prepared by a microwave reaction that exhibits high activity and long-term stability in both three-electrode systems and PEM devices. The lattice strain and charge transfer induced by the metal-oxide SN increase the work function of the Ru-RuO2-SN, optimize the local electronic structure, and reduce the desorption energy of the metal site to the oxygen-containing intermediates; as a result, it leads to the oxide path mechanism (OPM) and inhibits the excessive oxidation of surface ruthenium. The Ru-RuO2-SN requires only 165 mV overpotential to obtain 10 mA·cm-2 with 1400 h stability without obvious activity degradation, achieving a stability number (6.7 × 106) matching iridium-based catalysts. In a PEM electrolyzer with Ru-RuO2-SN as an anode catalyst, only 1.6 V is needed to reach 1.0 A·cm-2 and it shows long-term stability at 100 mA·cm-2 for 1100 h and at 500 mA·cm-2 for 100 h. The reaction mechanism for the high stability of Ru-RuO2-SN was analyzed by density functional theory calculations. This work reports a durable, pure Ru-based water-oxidation catalyst and provides a new perspective for the development of efficient Ru-based catalysts.

Photoinduced splitting of water using photocatalysts in the form of nanoparticles is a promising and simple way to produce environmentally friendly hydrogen. In this paper, we investigate the potential of modified barium titanate (BaTiO 3 ), an inexpensive perovskite oxide obtained from precursors widely distributed on earth, to develop effective electrocatalysts for water oxidation using first-principles calculations. It has been shown that the BaTiO 3 (001) surface terminated with TiO 2 is more promising in terms of its use as a catalyst. After replacing Ti with Rh, the dopant ion can take over part of the electron density from neighboring oxygen ions. As a result, during the oxidation reaction of water, rhodium ions can be in an intermediate oxidation state between 3+ and 4+. This affects the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates on the surface of the catalyst, reducing the excess potential.

We report on time-resolved coherent diffraction imaging of gas-phase silver nanoparticles, strongly heated via their plasmon resonance. The x-ray diffraction images reveal a broad range of phenomena for different excitation strengths, from simple melting over strong cavitation to explosive disintegration. Molecular dynamics simulations fully reproduce this behavior and show that the heating induces rather similar trajectories through the phase diagram in all cases, with the very different outcomes resulting solely from whether and where the stability limit of the metastable superheated liquid is crossed.

Abstract Hydrogen generation via a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer manifests the vertex of fundamental and practical studies on technology transferring electricity into hydrogen fuels. However, the harsh working conditions, especially the strong reductive acidic electrolyte‐catalyst interface, make non‐noble metal‐based cathodes unsuitable for PEM electrolyzer. Here, a scale‐up application of F modified CoP (CoP|F) cathode is demonstrated from 0.2 cm 2 lab‐scale three‐electrode setup to a commercial 38 cm 2 PEM electrolyzer. The operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Raman results confirm that F modification can promote the breakage of Co─P bonds, reconstructed to amorphous metallic Co as true HER active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the presence of F in the CoP 1‐x lattice would lead to a more facile formation of P‐vacancy under HER conditions, leading to more active zerovalent Co active sites for HER. This reconstructed surface shows high activity and tolerance in the reductive acidic electrolyte‐catalyst interface. When used as a cathode in a commercial PEM electrolyzer, its performance is comparable to the state‐of‐the‐art Pt/C catalyst, with a calculated hydrogen cost to be 2.17 $ kg H2 −1 . This work suggests a surface‐reconstruction pathway to fabricate cost‐saving and durable non‐noble metal‐based cathodes for commercial PEM electrolyzers.

Abstract Zinc–air batteries (ZABs) are promising electrochemical energy storages, but inefficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharging and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging at their cathodes impede achieving high energy density and stable cycling. We report a serrated leaf‐like nitrogen‐doped copper sulfide (N‐CuS) cathode with conductive N 2p‐S 3p hybridized orbitals, oxygen‐transporting mesopores, and about fivefold larger surface area than Cu. A ZAB with the N‐CuS cathode exhibits a 788 mAh g −1 capacity (96% of theoretical) and a hitherto highest energy density of 916.0 Wh kg −1 , surpassing one with the state‐of‐the‐art Pt/C+RuO₂ cathode (712.43 mAh g −1 and 874 Wh kg −1 ). Density functional theory calculations elucidate that O═O bond dissociation is 0.97 eV more favorable on N‐CuS than CuS. Subsequently, protonation of surface‐adsorbed *O to *OH occurs via dissociate (0.55 V), non‐spit associate (1.05 V), and split associate (1.05 V) pathways, with *OH then desorbing as OH ‐ . Under anaerobic conditions, copper oxide transitions from CuO to Cu 2 O (1.05 V) and eventually to Cu (0.75 V) releasing oxygen to sustain ORR. Additionally, a ZAB with the N‐CuS cathode achieves about threefold longer cyclability than one with the Pt/C+IrO₂ cathode, and about six‐fold longer cyclability than one with the Pt/C+RuO₂ cathode.

Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) heavily depends on their substrates. However, heterojunctions with traditional substrate materials often fail to provide the desired dynamic interface effects. Here, through a systematic study of the ferroelectric heterostructure In 2 Se 3 /C‐N‐M, the feasibility of using ferroelectric materials to achieve dynamic optimization of the OER activity on SACs is demonstrated. The ferroelectric In 2 Se 3 is confirmed to be an effective substrate for improving the stability of various SACs, supported by theoretical results of their negative formation energy and positive dissolution potential. Activity analysis indicates that among these In 2 Se 3 /C‐N‐M systems, the In 2 Se 3 /C‐N‐Ir can achieve near‐ideal catalytic activities through polarization switching. It can unprecedentedly catalyze OER via a hybrid pathway of adsorbate evolution mechanism and O‐O coupling mechanism under different pH conditions (from pH = 1 to pH = 13). Machine learning models have been developed to conduct feature analysis and make ultrafast predictions of OER activity, which identify that the interfacial charge transfer triggered by ferroelectric polarization is the key to fine‐tuning the OER performance of SACs. This work provides a theoretical framework that utilizes ferroelectric polarization as a powerful approach to navigate the design of efficient SACs.

Developing highly active, low-cost, and durable catalysts for efficient oxygen reduction reactions remain a challenge, hindering the commercial viability of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this study, an ordered PtZnFeCoNiCr high-entropy intermetallic electrocatalyst with Pt antisite point defects (PD-PZFCNC-HEI) is synthesized. The electrocatalyst shows high mass activity of 4.12 A mgPt-1 toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is 33 times that of the commercial Pt/C. PEMFC, assembled with PD-PZFCNC-HEI as the cathode (0.05 mgPt cm-2), exhibits a peak power density of 1.9 W cm-2 and a high mass activity of 3.0 A mgPt-1 at 0.9 V. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ X-ray absorption fine structure results reveal that defect engineering optimizes Pt's electronic structure and activates non-noble metal site active centers, achieving exceptionally high ORR catalytic activity. This study provides guidance for the development of nanostructured ordered high-entropy intermetallic catalysts.

We introduce the elEmBERT model for chemical classification tasks. It is based on deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder architecture. We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic, and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Materials Project and MoleculeNet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.

ZnAl2O4 spinel is widely used as a support in various reactions due to its thermal stability. Investigating the interaction between CO and ZnAl2O4 is essential for understanding the surface reaction mechanisms. In the present work, density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio atomistic thermodynamics were employed to investigate the adsorption of CO on perfect and O-defective ZnAl2O4 surfaces at varying CO coverages. The results reveal the formation of C* species and the subsequent aggregation can be hindered by the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy (Ovac) at low CO coverages. Notably, at high CO coverages, carbon deposition (CD) occurs on the ZnAl2O4 surfaces. ΔμCO is regulated below its threshold based on surface Ovac concentrations to control CO coverage and thereby suppress CD. At 523 K, the CO partial pressures should be maintained below 100, 10-3, 100, and 10-6 atm for surface with Ovac concentrations of 0, 12.5, 25, and 37.5%, respectively, to prevent CD on the surface. DFT-simulated IR spectra show that varying Ovac concentrations significantly affects the CO adsorption peak types and shifts, causing red shifts in vibrational frequencies for linearly adsorbed CO. These findings provide guidance for synthesizing ZnAl2O4 with varying Ovac concentrations to enhance catalyst efficiency and durability while mitigating CD.

Electron transfer is always the spotlight in electrochemistry, especially electrochemical energy storage. However, the current understanding of electron transfer, particularly in heterogeneous systems as explained by Marcus theory, faces challenges in accurately accounting for surface effects, solvent reorganization, and quantum tunneling, which are critical to real‐world applications. Here, this review presents a comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous electron transfer processes within the framework of Marcus theory, focusing on computing approaches using Python and Wolfram Language. The introduction outlines the significance of Marcus theory in explaining electron transfer reactions and sets the stage for the subsequent discussions. In the results and discussions section, the electron distribution in heterogeneous systems is explored, comparing the effects of different formalisms on electron transfer. A detailed comparison of the computational approaches using Python and Mathematica underscores the essential role of programing in tackling complex electron transfer models. These tools offer powerful, complementary capabilities for simulating the nuanced behavior of heterogeneous electron transfer processes, providing researchers with the flexibility and precision necessary to address the limitations of traditional theoretical methods. Finally, the work delves into the law of conservation of energy within the context of Marcus theory, offering a nuanced discussion of its implications for electron transfer studies. This review aims to equip researchers with practical insights and computing tools to enhance their understanding and application of Marcus theory in heterogeneous systems.

Two-dimensional carbon materials and their derivatives are widely applied as promising electrocatalysts and supports of single-atom sites. Theoretical investigations of 2D carbon materials are usually based on planar models, yet ignore local curvature brought on by possible surface distortion, which can be significant to the exact catalytic performance as has been realized in latest research. In this work, the curvature-influenced electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) reactivity of heme-like FeN4 single-atom site was predicted by a first-principle study, with FeN4-CNT(m,m) (m = 5~10) models adopted as local curvature models. The results showed that a larger local curvature is favored for NRR, with a lower limiting potential and higher N2 adsorption affinity, while a smaller local curvature shows lower NH3 desorption energy and is beneficial for catalyst recovery. Using electronic structures and logarithm fitting, we also found that FeN4-CNT(5,5) shows an intermediate-spin state, which is different from the high-spin state exhibited by other FeN4-CNT(m,m) (m = 6~10) models with a smaller local curvature.

A comprehensive understanding of the electrode-electrolyte interface in energy conversion systems remains challenging due to the complex and multifaceted nature of interfacial processes. This complexity hinders the development of more efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to the theoretical description of the OER process on nickel-iron-based oxyhydroxides (γ-Ni1-xFexOOH) electrodes in alkaline media as a model system. Multiple reaction pathways represented by the single- and dual-site mechanisms were investigated by taking into account the realistic structure of the catalyst, the doping, and the solvation effects using a simple and computationally feasible strategy. Accounting for the variable solvation effects considerably affects the predicted overpotential in a roughly linear relationship between overpotential and dielectric constant. By incorporating quantum chemical simulations with kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that tuning the local solvation environment can significantly enhance the OER activity, opening new routine ways for elucidation of the emerging issues of OER processes on transition metal oxide surfaces and design of cost-effective, efficient electrocatalytic systems.

Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to several energy technologies but suffers from low activity. Leveraging the lattice oxygen activation mechanism (LOM) is a strategy for boosting its activity. However, this approach faces significant thermodynamic challenges, requiring high-valent oxidation of metal ions without compromising their stability. We reveal that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can efficiently activate the LOM through synergistic multi-path electron transfer. Specifically, the oxidation of nickel is enhanced by this electron transfer, aided by the integration of weaker Co-O bonds, enabling effective LOM at the Ni-Co dual-site. These insights allow the design of a NiFeCoCrW0.2 HEA that exhibits improved activity, achieving an overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. It also demonstrates good stability, maintaining the potential with less than 5% variation over 90 days at 100 mA cm-2 current density. This study sheds light on the synergistic effects that confer high activity in HEAs and contribute to the advancement of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.

Biomass-based carbon materials are considered promising metal-free catalysts for the 2e- oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to synthesize H2O2 and act as air electrodes in Zn-air batteries. However, optimization of the catalyst structure is a complex process due to the diversity of biomass precursors and synthesis parameters. Machine learning, a new artificial intelligence technology, has recently been used in various fields owing to its ability to rapidly analyze large amounts of data and guide material synthesis. Consequently, we constructed a machine learning model based on previously reported experimental data and guided the fabrication of a boron-doped biomass carbon catalyst for the 2e- ORR. The achieved catalytic performance exceeded most reported ORR catalysts in terms of H2O2 selectivity (90-95% in broad potentials of 0.30-0.68 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), stability (maintaining over 90% selectivity for 12 h), yield (3450 mmol gcatalyst-1 h-1), and Faraday efficiency (over 90%). We applied the catalysts to Zn-air batteries and showed a high capacity (2856 mAh g-1) and stability twice that of traditional commercial metal catalysts. Therefore, this study proposed an effective machine learning model to guide the fabrication of biomass-based catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis.

The pivotal area of research in the quest for sustainable and efficient methods although highly effective for industrial ammonia production, is energy-intensive and reliant on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to global carbon emissions. NRR offers a promising alternative, enabling ammonia synthesis at ambient temperatures and pressures using renewable energy sources. This reaction, where nitrogen is converted into ammonia through electrochemical means, mitigate environmental demand for green technologies in chemical manufacturing. At the core of NRR is the challenge of nitrogen activation, as molecular Electrocatalysts play a crucial role in facilitating this reaction by lowering the energy barriers associated with nitrogen dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Various materials, including precious metals, transition metal compounds, and novel carbon-based nanostructures, have been explored for their catalytic properties.

Electrochemical hydrogenation, powered by renewable electricity, represents a promising sustainable approach for organic synthesis and the valorization of biomass-derived chemicals. Traditional strategies often rely on alkaline conditions to mitigate the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, posing challenges in sourcing hydrogen atoms for hydrogenation, which can be addressed through localized water dissociation on the electrode surface. In this study, we present a computationally guided design of electrochemical hydrogenation catalysts by optimizing hydrogen coverage density and binding strength on the electrode. Our theoretical investigations identify Cu, Au, and Ag - metals with moderate hydrogen coverage - as promising catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenations in alkaline media. These predictions are experimentally validated using a model organic substrate (acetophenone), achieving yields and faradaic efficiencies of up to 90%. Additionally, Cu, a nonprecious metal, is demonstrated to selectively hydrogenate a wide range of unsaturated compounds, including C═O, C═C, C≡C, and C≡N bonds, at low potentials with moderate to excellent conversion rates and chemoselectivities. This work highlights the potential of tailoring hydrogen coverage on electrode surfaces to rationally design nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for efficient organic hydrogenations. The insights gained here are expected to inform the development of more effective catalysts for organic hydrogenations and other industrially relevant chemical transformations.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has, in recent years, attracted great interest from scientists because of its prime role in a number of renewable energy technologies. It is one of the reactions that occurs during hydrogen production through water splitting, is used in rechargeable metal–air batteries, and plays a fundamental role in regenerative fuel cells. Therefore, there is an emerging need to develop new, active, stable, and cost-effective materials for OER. This review presents the latest research on various groups of materials, showing their potential to be used as OER electrocatalysts, as well as their shortcomings. Particular attention has been paid to metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives, as those materials offer coordinatively unsaturated sites, high density of transition metals, adjustable pore size, developed surface area, and the possibility to be modified and combined with other materials.

Abstract Pt nanoparticles dispersed on carbon supports (Pt/C) are the benchmark oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, their widespread application is hindered by severe stability degradation under high potentials and acidic environments, primarily due to carbon support corrosion. To address this challenge, a multiscale template‐assisted method is proposed, combined with ethylene glycol reduction, to fabricate Pt nanoparticles supported onto multiscale porous conductive antimony tin oxides (Pt/PT‐SSO). Both theoretical and experimental approaches have shown that the strong interaction between Pt and support markedly accelerates electron transfer and optimizes the adsorption strength of key intermediates on the Pt surface. Furthermore, the unique multiscale porous structure of support not only provides an ideal platform for the uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles but also greatly enhances confinement effect, effectively preventing Pt aggregation. As a result, the Pt/PT‐SSO exhibits superior ORR activity and durability compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Specifically, its mass activity at 0.9 V (vs RHE) reaches 0.617 A mgPt⁻¹, which is twice that of Pt/C, while maintaining outstanding stability over 50 h. Notably, PEMFCs utilizing Pt/PT‐SSO achieve a high power density of 1.173 W cm⁻ 2 and retain 94.9% after 30,000 cycles of accelerated durability testing.

This study presents a machine learning (ML)-augmented framework for accurately predicting excited-state properties critical to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. By integrating the computational efficiency of semi-empirical PPP+CIS theory with a Δ-ML approach, the model overcomes the inherent limitations of PPP+CIS in predicting key properties, including singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) energies, singlet–triplet gaps (ΔEST), and oscillator strength (f). The model demonstrated exceptional accuracy across datasets of varying sizes and diverse molecular features, notably excelling in predicting oscillator strength and ΔEST values, including negative regions relevant to TADF molecules with inverted S1–T1 gaps. This work highlights the synergy between physics-inspired models and machine learning in accelerating the design of efficient TADF emitters, providing a foundation for future studies on complex systems and advanced functional materials.

Abstract Molecular graphene provides an attractive man‐made artificial system to realize designer Dirac fermions with exotic properties and significant implications in electronics/spintronics, but its large‐scale fabrication remains a challenge as the available approach involves molecule‐by‐molecule manipulation of CO on a metal surface using a scanning tunneling microscopy tip. Here, we propose the epitaxial growth of molecular graphene on metal surface alloy, where CO molecules could be naturally self‐assembled into a hexagonal lattice. Via high‐throughput first‐principles calculations, the adsorption behaviors of CO on 30 surface alloys Cu 2 M (M represents the alloyed element) with a ()‐ R 30° superstructure on Cu(111) is explored. By systematically analyzing the structures, energetic and electronic properties of the adsorbed systems with different CO coverages, three surface alloys, Cu 2 Zn, Cu 2 Ga, and Cu 2 Ge, on which molecular graphene can be spontaneously formed, are successfully screened out. Remarkably, the self‐assembled molecular graphene is featured by an effective four‐band model involving the molecular (, ) orbitals of CO on a hexagonal lattice, leading to quantum spin Hall effect. This work paves an avenue for the large‐scale growth of artificial graphene, which should stimulate immediate interest among experimentalists in the synthesis, characterization, and implementation of topological states for dissipationless transport and quantum computing.

Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial data set creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.

The scarcity of iridium (Ir) limits its widespread use in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, mesoporous single-crystalline spinel Co3O4 with atomically dispersed low-valence-state Ir has been developed to enable Ir's efficient and stable utilization. The surface Pourbaix diagram suggests that under acidic OER conditions, O* fully covers both Co3O4(111) and (110) surfaces, passivating Co sites but enhancing Co3O4's structural stability, a benefit further improved by Ir doping. Mesopores offer numerous loading sites for Ir single atoms (13.8 wt %), which activate the originally O*-passivated Co3O4(111) surface by creating high-intrinsic-activity Co-Ir bridge sites; meanwhile, Ir and Co leaching rates are reduced to about 1/4 and 1/5, respectively, compared to conventional Ir/Co3O4 catalysts. Our catalyst exhibits a low η10 of 248 mV for over 100 h, showcasing its potential in water electrolysis.

Abstract The hydrogen produced by Al‐doped SrTiO 3 /TiO 2 core‒shell catalysts with a range of Al‐doped SrTiO 3 cores and the same TiO 2 shell are compared. The study included SrTiO 3 cores doped with different amounts of Al (0, 1, 2, or 3 mol%) added at different points in the synthesis (prior to or during the molten salt treatment) and at different temperatures (900°C, 1000°C, and 1100°C). It was found that core‒shell catalysts with different cores had hydrogen generation rates that varied by a factor of more than 40 and varied with the processing parameters in the same way as the hydrogen generation rates of the cores alone. The best catalysts had 2 or 3 mol% added Al, added during treatment in a SrCl 2 molten salt at 1000°C or 1100°C. Because the core absorbs most of the light, its ability to separate and transport photogenerated charge carriers dominates the properties of the core‒shell catalyst. This indicates that, to optimize the properties of core‒shell catalysts, it is essential to optimize the properties of the core. While the shell can be important to protect the core from degradation, it is not as important to the overall reactivity as the core.
