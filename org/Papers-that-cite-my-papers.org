Abstract Enhancement of an alkaline water splitting reaction in Pt‐based single‐atom catalysts (SACs) relies on effective metal‐support interactions. A Pt single atom (Pt SA )‐immobilized three‐phased Pt SA @VP‐Ni 3 P‐MoP heterostructure on nickel foam is presented, demonstrating high catalytic performance. The existence of Pt SA on triphasic metal phosphides gives an outstanding performance toward overall water splitting. The Pt SA @VP‐Ni 3 P‐MoP performs a low overpotential of 28 and 261 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 and 25 mA cm −2 , respectively. The Pt SA @VP‐Ni 3 P‐MoP (+,−) alkaline electrolyzer achieves a minimum cell voltage of 1.48 V at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 for overall water splitting. Additionally, the electrocatalyst exhibits a substantial Faradaic yield of ≈98.12% for H 2 and 98.47% for O 2 at a current density of 50 mA cm −2 . Consequently, this study establishes a connection for understanding the active role of single metal atoms in substrate configuration for catalytic performance. It also facilitates the successful synthesis of SACs, with a substantial loading on transition metal phosphides and maximal atomic utilization, providing more active sites and, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic activity.

Abstract Efficient, stable, and low‐cost oxygen reduction catalysts are the key to the large‐scale application of metal–air batteries. Herein, high‐dispersive Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (NPs) with abundant oxygen vacancies uniformly are anchored on lignin‐derived metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) hierarchical porous nanosheets as efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts (Fe 2 O 3 /M–N–C, M═Cu, Mn, W, Mo) based on a general and economical KCl molten salt‐assisted method. The combination of Fe with the highly electronegative O induces charge redistribution through the Fe–O–M structure, thereby reducing the adsorption energy of oxygen‐containing substances. The coupling effect of Fe 2 O 3 NPs with M–N–C expedites the catalytic activity toward ORR by promoting proton generation on Fe 2 O 3 and transfer to M–N–C. Experimental and theoretical calculation further revealed the remarkable electronic structure evolution of the metal site during the ORR process, where the emission density and local magnetic moment of the metal atoms change continuously throughout their reaction. The unique layered porous structure and highly active M–N 4 sites resulted in the excellent ORR activity of Fe 2 O 3 /Cu–N–C with the onset potential of 0.977 V, which is superior to Pt/C. This study offers a feasible strategy for the preparation of non‐noble metal catalysts and provides a new comprehension of the catalytic mechanism of M–N–C catalysts.

Abstract To enable open-environment application of artificial photosynthesis, the direct utilization of environmental CO2 via an oxygen-tolerant reductive procedure is necessary. Herein, we introduce an in-situ growth strategy for fabricating two-dimensional heterojunctions between indium porphyrin metal-organic framework (In-MOF) and single-layer graphene oxide (GO). Upon illumination, the In-MOF/GO heterostructure facilitates a tandem CO2 capture and photocatalytic reduction on its hydroxylated In-node, prioritizing the reduction of dilute CO2 even in the presence of air-level O2. The In-MOF/GO heterostructure photocatalyst was integrated with a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane to construct a floatable artificial leaf. Through a triphase photocatalytic reaction, the floatable artificial leaf can remove aqueous contaminants from real water while efficiently reducing CO2 at low concentrations (10%, approximately the CO2 concentration in combustion flue gases) upon air-level O2. This study provides a scalable approach for the construction of photocatalytic devices for CO2 conversion in open environments.

With the depletion of traditional energy sources and growing environmental concerns, it is becoming increasingly urgent to develop green, low-emission renewable energy technologies to replace fossil fuel-driven methods that emit carbon dioxide (CO2). Currently, the electrochemical production of high-value-added chemicals and fuels from CO2 has aroused great interest from scientists. However, to make full use of CO2 for the preparation of chemicals, it is necessary to expand the range of electrosynthesis methods, in particular by expanding reaction pathways through the reaction of CO2 with different substrates. In general, CO2 can form new covalent bonds with substrate molecules through the formation of C−X bonds, including C−H, C−C, C−N, C−O, and C−S bonds, which would expand the range of possible products by diversifying the reaction pathway. In this review, we focus on the research progress in electrochemical conversion of CO2 through C−X bond formation. We start by examining fundamentals of the reactions and summarizing the reaction modes. Next, we discuss the electrosynthesis of C−X bonds (C−H, C−C, C−N, C−O, C−S) using CO2 and different substrate molecules. Finally, (i) strategies for the design and activity optimization of catalyst materials and (ii) the future development of forming five types of bonds from CO2 and small molecules are discussed, along with an outlook on their future research prospects.

Hydrogen titanates (HTOs) form a diverse group of metastable, layered titanium oxides with an interlayer containing both water molecules and structural protons. We investigated how the chemistry of this interlayer environment influenced electrochemical Li+-insertion in a series of HTOs, H2TiyO2y+1·nH2O (y = 3, 4, and 5). We correlated the electrochemical response with the physical and chemical properties of HTOs using operando X-ray diffraction, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy, solid-state proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and quasi-elastic neutron scattering. We found that the potential for the first reduction reaction trended with the relative acidity of the structural protons. This mechanism was supported with first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We propose that the electrochemical reaction involves reduction of the structural protons to yield hydrogen gas and formation of a lithiated hydrogen titanate (H2–xLixTiyO2y+1). The hydrogen gas is confined within the HTO lattice until the titanate structure expands upon subsequent oxidation. Our work has implications for the electrochemical behavior of insertion hosts containing hydrogen and structural water molecules, where hydrogen evolution is expected at potentials below the hydrogen reduction potential and in the absence of electrolyte proton donors. This behavior is an example of electrochemical electron transfer to a nonmetal element in a metal oxide host, in analogy to anion redox.

Accurate elucidation of gas-phase chemical structures using collision cross section (CCS) values obtained from ion-mobility mass spectrometry benefits from a synergism between experimental and in silico results. We have shown in recent work that for a molecule of modest size with a proscribed conformational space we can successfully capture a conformation(s) that can match experimental CCS values. However, for flexible systems such as fatty acids that have many rotatable bonds and multiple intramolecular London dispersion interactions, it becomes necessary to sample a much greater conformational space. Sampling more conformers, however, accrues significant computational cost downstream in optimization steps involving quantum mechanics. To reduce this computational expense for lipids, we have developed a novel machine learning (ML) model to facilitate conformer filtering according to the estimated gas-phase CCS values. Herein we report that the implementation of our CCS knowledge-based approach for conformational sampling resulted in improved structure prediction agreement with experiment by achieving favorable average CCS prediction errors of ∼2% for lipid systems in both the validation set and the test set. Moreover, most of the gas-phase candidate conformations obtained by using CCS focusing achieved lower energy-minimum geometries than the candidate conformations without focusing. Altogether, the implementation of this ML model into our modeling workflow has proven to be beneficial for both the quality of the results and the turnaround time. Finally, while our approach is limited to lipids, it can be readily extended to other molecules of interest.

IrOx of the amorphous phase has long been recognized to exhibit higher catalytic activity than crystalline analogues toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but always at the expense of reduced stability. Here, we report an ultrathin Ir surface with high-density grain boundaries (GBs), which transforms into locally stabilized amorphous IrOx by forming an Ir/IrOx interface under OER conditions. The catalyst displays a low overpotential of 263 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a mass activity (5.8 A mgIr–1 at 1.53 V) of over 90-fold higher than that of commercial IrO2, along with long-term stability for over 350 h. The activity enhancement arises from the stronger binding strength of *OOH on the amorphous GBs relative to the crystalline region, thus breaking the scaling relationship between *OH and *OOH and reducing the energy barrier for the potential determining step of the OER. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis using this catalyst achieves 2.7 A cm–2 at 2 V cell voltage and operates stably at 1 A cm–2 for over 200 h. The stabilization of the amorphous IrOx phase at GBs may accelerate the development of more active and robust acidic OER electrocatalysts.

Vacancy-ordered perovskite oxides are attracting attention due to their diverse functions such as resistive switching, electrocatalytic activity, oxygen diffusivity, and ferroelectricity. It is important to clarify the chemical lattice strains arising from compositional changes and the associated vacancy order–disorder phase transitions at the atomic scale. Here, we elucidate the intermediate process of a topotactic phase transition in Ca-doped bismuth ferrite films consisting of alternating stacks of oxygen perovskite layers and a brownmillerite-type oxygen vacancy layer. We use Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to closely examine the evolution of local strains exerted on the constituent sub-layers by electrochemical oxidation. A negative Raman chemical shift is observed during oxidation, which is linearly correlated with the local negative chemical expansivity of the oxygen layer. It seemingly contradicts with the general trend that oxides undergo lattice contraction upon oxidation. Oxygen vacancies initially confined in the vacancy layers can be understood to diffuse into the oxygen layers during melting of the ordered structure. The finding deepens our understanding of the electro-chemo-mechanical coupling of vacancy-ordered oxides.

Abstract Although ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) is an efficacious oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in acidic media, its performance in alkaline conditions is subpar and it is also ineffective for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in common electrolytes. Here, an effective phosphorus (P)‐doping strategy is introduced to manipulate the d ‐band center of ruthenium (Ru) sites, attenuating the adsorption energy of HER intermediates and lowering the energy barrier in OER, thereby significantly accelerating both HER and OER performance. The representative 10%P‐RuO 2 nanofibers (NFs) catalyst presents an ultralow overpotential of 177.9 mV at 1 A cm −2 and long‐term stability of 300 h in 1 m KOH toward HER, greatly exceeding those of benchmark platinum (Pt)/C catalyst. Moreover, the 10%P‐RuO 2 NFs catalyst exhibits an exceptional OER performance with a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm −2 (η 10 ) and desirable stability of 150 h at 1 A cm −2 , which is far better than commercial RuO 2 and many other typical previously reported OER catalysts. Additionally, an overall water electrolytic cell using 10%P‐RuO 2 NFs as both anode and cathode necessitates a working voltage of 1.52 V (η 10 ) and demonstrates long‐term stability over 100 h at 1 A cm −2 , outperforming many typical water electrolysis cells.

Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising route for realizing green and sustainable ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions. However, one of the major challenges of currently available Single-atom catalysts (SACs) is poor catalytic activity and low catalytic selectivity, which is far away from the requirements of industrial applications. Herein, first-principle calculations within the density functional theory were performed to evaluate the feasibility of a single Mo atom anchored on a g-C9N10 monolayer (Mo@g-C9N10) as NRR electrocatalysts. The results demonstrated that the gas phase N2 molecule can be sufficiently activated on Mo@g-C9N10, and N2 reduction dominantly occurs on the active Mo atom via the preferred enzymatic mechanism, with a low limiting potential of −0.48 V. In addition, Mo@g-C9N10 possesses a good prohibition ability for the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. More impressively, good electronic conductivity and high electron transport efficiency endow Mo SACs with excellent activity for electrocatalytic N2 reduction. This theoretical research not only accelerates the development of NRR electrocatalysts but also increases our insights into optimizing the catalytic performance of SACs.

Efficient and durable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction are essential for realizing the large-scale application of water electrolysis technologies. Here, we report a novel Zn-doped NiOOH subnanowires (Zn–NiOOH SNWs) catalyst synthesized via the electrochemical reconstruction of Zn–NiMoO4 SNWs. The inclusion of Zn triggers a transition in the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism of NiOOH from the adsorbate evolution mechanism to the lattice oxygen mechanism, resulted from Zn's adaptive adjustment of coordination types, which also improves the reaction energetics, thereby enhancing the stability and activity. Furthermore, the subnanowire structure provides further stabilization of the lattice oxygen in Zn–NiOOH, preventing its destructive dissolution. Remarkably, Zn–NiOOH SNWs display a current density of 10 mA cm–2 with an overpotential of only 179 mV and maintain stable operation at 200 mA cm–2 for 800 h with minimal changes in overpotential, establishing them as one of the most effective catalysts involving lattice oxygen for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. When utilized as the anode in an alkaline water electrolyzer, our Zn–NiOOH SNWs catalyst demonstrates stability exceeding 500 h under a water-splitting current of 200 mA cm–2, indicating promising potential for practical applications.

Electrode surfaces modified with peptides or other biomolecules are of great interest for applications in catalysis and separations. At the electrochemical interface, the structure of biomolecular adsorbates may be sensitive to the applied potential and the distribution of solvent and ions near the electrode surface. Herein, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to describe changes in the adsorption structure of the l-cysteine amino acid on Au(111) as a function of applied potential. This theoretical study reveals the fundamental mechanisms of potential-dependent rearrangement of cysteine on electrode surfaces. These systems are analyzed using a hybrid quantum–classical computational approach that combines constant-potential periodic DFT with a classical representation of the liquid electrolyte. In agreement with experimental measurements, grand canonical thermodynamic analyses suggest that the cysteine exists primarily in its zwitterionic form over a wide range of applied potentials. The structure of adsorbed zwitterionic cysteine is dictated by the cationic ammonium and anionic carboxylate functional groups, where these charged moieties experience competing Coulombic interactions with the charged Au(111) surface and the electrolyte ions within the electric double layer. These competing interactions drive the rearrangement of cysteine with applied potential, which in turn determines the nature of ion structuring at the interface. The potential-dependent free energies of cysteine zwitterions are also significantly influenced by the ionic strength of the electrolyte because of the interactions between charged zwitterion functional groups and oppositely charged electrolyte ions. Understanding the interplay between adsorption structure, applied potential, and electrolyte ion structuring can guide the assembly of structured biomolecules on solid surfaces. The impact of zwitterionic amino acids and peptides on near-surface electrolyte composition may be further exploited to tailor microenvironments for various applications of interfacial electrochemistry.

Development of high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial to realizing the electrolytic water cycle. C60 is an ideal substrate material for single atom catalysts (SACs) due to its unique electron-withdrawing properties and spherical structure. In this work, we screened for a novel single-atom catalyst based on C60, which anchored transition metal atoms in the C60 molecule by coordination with N atoms. Through first-principles calculations, we evaluated the stability and activity of MN4–C54 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, Pt, Ir, Au). The results indicate that CuN4–C54, which is based only on earth-abundant elements, exhibited low overpotentials of 0.46 and 0.47 V for the OER and ORR, respectively, and was considered a promising bifunctional catalyst, showing better performance than the noble-metal ones. In addition, according to the linear relationship of intermediates, we established volcano plots to describe the activity trends of the OER and ORR on MN4–C54. Finally, d-band center and crystal orbital Hamiltonian populations methods were used to explain the catalytic origin. Suitable d-band centers lead to moderate adsorption strength, further leading to good catalytic performances.

Most chemical processes happen at a local scale where only a subset of molecular orbitals is directly involved and only a subset of covalent bonds may be rearranged. To model such reactions, Density Functional Theory (DFT) is often inadequate, and the use of computationally more expensive correlated wavefunction (WF) methods is required for accurate results. Mixed-resolution approaches backed by quantum embedding theory have been used extensively to approach this imbalance. Based on the frozen density embedding freeze-and-thaw algorithm, we describe an approach to embed complete active space self-consistent field simulations run in the OpenMolcas code in a DFT environment calculated in CP2K without requiring any external tools. This makes it possible to study a local, active part of a chemical system in a larger and relatively static environment with a computational cost balanced between the accuracy of a WF method and the efficiency of DFT, which we test on environment–subsystem pairs. Finally, we apply the implementation to an oxygen molecule leaving an aluminum (111) surface and a ruthenium(IV) oxide (110) surface.

Water electro-oxidation to form H2O2 is an important way to produce H2O2 which is widely applied in industry. However, its mechanism is under debate and HO(ads), hydroxyl group adsorbed onto the surface of the electrode, is regarded as an important intermediate. Herein, we study the mechanism of water oxidation to H2O2 at Pt electrode using in-situ Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and find peroxide bond mainly originated from the coupling of two CO32- via a C2O62- intermediate. By quantifying the 18O isotope in the product, we find that 93% of H2O2 was formed via the CO32- coupling route and 7% of H2O2 is from OH(ads)-CO3•− route. The OH(ads)-OH(ads) coupling route has a negligible contribution. The comparison of various electrodes shows that the strong adsorption of CO3(ads) at the electrode surface is essential. Combining with a commercial cathode catalyst to produce H2O2 during oxygen reduction, we assemble a flow cell in which the cathode and anode simultaneously produce H2O2. It shows a Faradaic efficiency of 150% of H2O2 at 1 A cm−2 with a cell voltage of 2.3 V. Electrosynthesis via two electron water reactions offers a promising method for decentralized H2O2 production, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Here, the authors address the challenge by using in-situ Raman and DEMS, and demonstrate 93% of H2O2 forms via the carbonate coupling route through a C2O62− intermediate.

Abstract Ammonia is an important raw material for agricultural production, playing a key role in global food production. However, conventional ammonia synthesis resulted in extensive greenhouse gas emissions and huge energy consumption. Recently, researchers have proposed electrocatalytic reverse artificial nitrogen cycle (eRANC) routes to circumvent these issues, which can be driven by electrocatalysis and sustainable electricity. Here, a theoretical and computational perspective on the challenges and opportunities with the comparison with experimental results: electrochemical reduction of nitrate (eNO 3 RR) and nitrite (eNO 2 RR), electrochemical reduction of nitric oxide (eNORR) combined with oxidative nitrogen fixation are presented. By comparison, the N 2 →NO→NH 3 route is proposed as the most promising in case the NO solubility can be solved well in reactor design. Its high efficiency of ammonia production is demonstrated. Instead, the eNO 3 RR can be another choice because it is non‐toxic and the solid‐liquid interface is usually efficient for electrochemical reactions, while its low selectivity at low overpotentials is an issue. These fundamentals highlight the potential and key factors of eRANC as an efficient and sustainable route for ammonia production.

A fundamental understanding of the oxidation mechanisms of aluminum (Al) alloys is of great importance for its applications in corrosion, catalysis, sensors, etc. In this work, we systematically investigated the first-stage oxidation behaviors of three low-index Al facets with O coverage up to two monolayers (ML) by using density-functional theory (DFT). The large negative adsorption energies indicated favorable oxidation on all three facets. However, distinctive structural and electronic changes induced by the adsorption of oxygen have led to different oxidation modes. More specifically, the oxidation process proceeded by "intercalating" into the subsurface region along the (111) plane out of the (110) facet with spontaneous O ingress into (110) far below one ML, as revealed by the electron density distribution, whereas the oxide ad-layer grew in a "layer-by-layer" mode on Al(111) and (001) facets. Moreover, various Al–O complexes with different atomic coordination numbers (CN), configurations, and sizes may be indicators of the tendency of an Al surface to be oxidized. Besides, the oxide phases formed on (111)/(001) and (110) assembled the Al–O bond distribution within α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3, respectively.
