Abstract Ligand protected gold nanoclusters have been proposed for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) as an alternative to polycrystalline catalysts, showing higher selectivity control due to the tailored composition and precise microenvironment. Here, two gold cluster families are studied with different staple motifs (Au 25 (SR) 18 and Au 144 (SR) 60 , where SR = thiolate) doped with Ag or Cu to understand the interplay between the composition and the performance of these catalysts. Detailed cluster characterization and Density Functional Theory simulations demonstrate that the dynamic aspects involving ligand removal are crucial to unraveling the role of the dopant, the cluster curvature, and the staple structure. The best activity performance toward CO is obtained for Cu‐doped Au 144 (SR) 60 at U = –0.8 V RHE as ligands are only partially depleted and the staple can bend to stabilize *CO intermediate, while Cu‐containing Au 25 (SR) 18 can produce formate but shows worse CO selectivity. This study points toward the importance of ligand stability during eCO 2 R on bimetallic gold nanoclusters, paving the way for improving the design and operation of this family of catalysts.

Strain engineering has the potential to modify the adsorption process and enhance the electrocatalytic activity, especially in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the introduction of lattice strain in electrocatalysts is often accompanied by a change in chemical composition, surface morphology, or phase structure to a certain extent, impeding the investigation of the intrinsic strain effect on HER.

An electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) presents an appealing strategy for ammonia (NH3) production at ambient conditions. Through systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the eNRR performance of 23 double-atom catalysts has been investigated. These catalysts are composed of a Mo atom and a transition metal atom anchored on the graphdiyne (GDY), and they are named MoM-GDYs. Among the 23 MoM-GDYs studied, 14 MoM-GDYs highlighted catalytic selectivity by inhibiting a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and demonstrated commendable eNRR catalytic performance. MoRu-GDY, MoMo-GDY, MoFe-GDY and MoY-GDY exhibited excellent eNRR catalytic activity with limiting potentials of −0.05 V, −0.13 V, −0.21 V and −0.24 V, respectively. These 14 catalysts favor N2 adsorption compared to H and exhibit less negative UL than the −0.98 V benchmark of the stepped Ru(0001) surface. Among them, MoRu-GDY has the best catalytic activity with an UL of −0.05 V. The excellent catalytic performance originates from the synergistic effect of the dual catalytic sites, where the alternation of the consecutive and enzymatic paths effectively reduces the limiting potentials. In addition, the catalytic activity can be evaluated using ΔG*NH3 − ΔG*NH2 as a theoretical descriptor, while UL and the ΔG*NH3 − ΔG*NH2 fit coefficient R2 reached 0.99. These findings not only contribute to the development of dual-atom electrocatalysts for eNRR but also offer a valuable pathway for identifying new eNRR catalysts with high activity and selectivity.

The use of a single-atom FeN4 catalyst on defective graphene (Fe-NC) has recently emerged as an effective method for the synthesis of amino acids. Herein, we investigated the mechanism of alanine formation on FeN4-doped graphene using comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations. The alanine formation reaction begins with the activation of NO molecules on the surface, followed by their reaction with hydrogen atoms provided in the system. The computational results show that NO molecules can be effectively activated on Fe-NC, facilitating the subsequent alanine formation at a relatively lower potential. The potential-limiting step in alanine production involves either the formation of HNO* or HNOH* intermediates on Fe-NG, as the free energy changes (ΔG) in these two elementary steps are nearly equivalent. Notably, the formation of HNO* exhibits a higher activation energy (Ea) compared to HNOH* formation. This study provides valuable insights into the C–N coupling reaction and the mechanism of amino acid synthesis on single-atom catalysts.

The optimization of atomic structures plays a pivotal role in understanding and designing materials with desired properties. However, conventional computational methods often struggle with the formidable task of navigating the vast potential energy surface, especially in high-dimensional spaces with numerous local minima. Recent advancements in machine learning-driven surrogate models offer a promising avenue for alleviating this computational burden. In this study, we propose anapproach that combines the strengths of universal machine learning potentials with a Bayesian approach using Gaussian processes. By using the machine learning potentials as priors for the Gaussian process, the Gaussian process has to learn only the difference between the machine learning potential and the target energy surface calculated for example by density functional theory. This turns out to improve the speed by which the global optimal structure is identified across diverse systems for a well-behaved machine learning potential. The approach is tested on periodic bulk materials, surface structures, and a cluster.

Surface phase diagrams are useful in material design for understanding catalytic reactions and deposition processes and are usually obtained by numerical calculations. However, a large number of calculations are required, and a strategy to reduce the computation time is necessary. In this study, we proposed a black-box optimization strategy to investigate the surface phase diagram with the smallest possible number of calculations. Our method was tested to examine the phase diagram in which two types of adsorbates, i.e., oxygen and carbon monoxide, were adsorbed onto a palladium surface. In comparison with a random calculation without using machine learning, we confirmed that the proposed method obtained a surface phase diagram with a small number of calculations. In conclusion, our strategy is a general-purpose method that can contribute to the rapid study of various types of surface phase diagrams.

One challenge remaining in the development of Ir-based electrocatalyst is the activity-stability paradox during acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), especially for the surface reconstructed IrOx catalyst with high efficiency. To address this, a phase selective Ir-based electrocatalyst is constructed by forming bridged W-O moiety in NiIrOx electrocatalyst. Through an electrochemical dealloying process, an nano-porous structure with surface-hydroxylated rutile NiWIrOx electrocatalyst is engineered via Ni as a sacrificial element. Despite low Ir content, NiWIrOx demonstrates a minimal overpotential of 180 mV for the OER at 10 mA·cm−2. It maintains a stable 300 mA·cm−2 current density during an approximately 300 h OER at 1.8 VRHE and shows a stability number of 3.9 × 105 noxygen · nIr−1. The resulting W – O–Ir bridging motif proves pivotal for enhancing the efficacy of OER catalysis by facilitating deprotonation of OER intermediates and promoting a thermodynamically favorable dual-site adsorbent evolution mechanism. Besides, the phase selective insertion of W-O in NiIrOx enabling charge balance through the W-O-Ir bridging motif, effectively counteracting lattice oxygen loss by regulating Ir-O co-valency. One challenge remaining in the electrocatalysts for acidic water electrolysis is the activity-stability paradox. Here, the authors report a facile approach to tackle the challenge by introducing a bridged W-O moiety in NiIrOx electrocatalyst, enhancing the efficacy and stability simultaneously.

The meticulous design of advanced electrocatalysts and their integration into gas diffusion electrode (GDE) architectures is emerging as a prominent research paradigm in the H2O2 electrosynthesis community. However, it remains perplexing that electrocatalysts and assembled GDE frequently exhibit substantial discrepancies in H2O2 selectivity during bulk electrolysis. Here, we elucidate the pivotal role of mass transfer behavior of key species (including reactants and products) beyond the intrinsic properties of the electrocatalyst in dictating electrode-scale H2O2 selectivity. This tendency becomes more pronounced in high reaction rate (current density) regimes where transport limitations are intensified. By utilizing diffusion-related parameters (DRP) of GDEs (i.e., wettability and catalyst layer thickness) as probe factors, we employ both short- and long-term electrolysis in conjunction with in-situ electrochemical reflection-absorption imaging and theoretical calculations to thoroughly investigate the impact of DRP and DRP-controlled local microenvironments on O2 and H2O2 mass transfer. The mechanistic origins of diffusion-dependent conversion selectivity at the electrode scale are unveiled accordingly. The fundamental insights gained from this study underscore the necessity of architectural innovations for mainstream hydrophobic GDEs that can synchronously optimize mass transfer of reactants and products, paving the way for next-generation GDEs in gas-consuming electroreduction scenarios. Electrocatalysts and assembled gas diffusion electrodes frequently exhibit discrepancies in selectivity during H2O2 electrosynthesis. Here, the authors report the pivotal role of key species transport beyond the intrinsic properties of electrocatalysts in dictating electrode-scale H2O2 selectivity.

Hydrogen energy plays an increasingly vital role in global energy transformation. However, existing electric–hydrogen coupled integrated energy systems (IESs) face two main challenges: achieving stable operation when integrated with large-scale networks and integrating optimal dispatching code with physical systems. This paper conducted comprehensive modeling, optimization and joint simulation verification of the above IES. Firstly, a low-carbon economic dispatching model of an electric–hydrogen coupled IES considering carbon capture power plants is established at the optimization layer. Secondly, by organizing and selecting representative data in the optimal dispatch model, an electric–hydrogen coupled IES planning model considering the integration of wind, photovoltaic (PV), diesel and storage is constructed at the physical layer. The proposed electric–hydrogen coupling model mainly consists of the following components: an alkaline electrolyzer, a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank with a compressor and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The IES model proposed in this paper achieved the integration of optimal dispatching mode with physical systems. The system can maintain stable control and operation despite unpredictable changes in renewable energy sources, showing strong resilience and reliability. This electric–hydrogen coupling model also can integrate with large-scale IES for stable joint operation, enhancing renewable energy utilization and absorption of PV and wind power. Co-simulation verification showed that the optimized model has achieved a 29.42% reduction in total system cost and an 83.66% decrease in carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the simulation model proved that the system’s total harmonic distortion rate is controlled below 3% in both grid-connected and islanded modes, indicating good power quality.

Establishing energy correlations among different metals can accelerate the discovery of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for complex reactions. Using a recently introduced coordination-based model, we can predict site-specific metal binding energies (ΔEM) that can be used as a descriptor for chemical reactions. In this study, we have examined a range of metals including Ag, Au, Co, Cu, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru and found linear correlations between predicted ΔEM and adsorption energies of CH and O (ΔECH and ΔEO) at various coordination environments for all the considered metals. Interestingly, all the metals correlate with one another under specific surface site coordination, indicating that different metals are interrelated in a particular coordination environment. Furthermore, we have tested and verified for PtPd- and PtIr-based alloys that they follow a similar behavior. Moreover, we have expanded the metal space by taking some early transition metals along with a few s-block metals and shown a cyclic behavior of the adsorbate binding energy (ΔEA) versus ΔEM. Therefore, ΔECH and ΔEO can be efficiently interpolated between metals, alloys, and intermetallics based on information related to one metal only. This simplifies the process of screening new metal catalyst formulations and their reaction energies.

Energy storage technologies have experienced significant advancements in recent decades, driven by the growing demand for efficient and sustainable energy solutions. The limitations associated with lithium’s supply chain, cost, and safety concerns have prompted the exploration of alternative battery chemistries. For this reason, research to replace widespread lithium batteries with sodium-ion batteries has received more and more attention. In the present work, we report cutting-edge research, where we explored a wide range of compositions of cathode materials for Na-ion batteries by first-principles calculations using workflow chains developed within the AiiDA framework. We trained crystal graph convolutional neural networks and geometric crystal graph neural networks, and we demonstrate the ability of the machine learning algorithms to predict the formation energy of the candidate materials as calculated by the density functional theory. This materials discovery approach is disruptive and significantly faster than traditional physics-based computational methods.

Flexible-robust metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit unique hybrid nature comprising both flexible and rigid framework characteristics, exhibit high potential for hydrocarbon separations. However, no clear guidelines have been established to regulate their hybrid characteristics owing to limited understanding of their adsorption mechanism. This study investigates the effects of the particle size of a flexible-robust MOF on its adsorption and structural transition behaviors. The robust nature originates from the structural transition of a metastable guest-free structure, while its flexible nature arises from another guest-free structure. The type of guest-free structure is predominantly determined by the particle size; particles below the critical size are trapped in the metastable guest-free structure. Notably, the critical size varies with the type of guest molecule to be removed; consequently, the difference in critical size results in guest-memory characteristics, enabling guest-free structure switching. These results underscore the importance of controlling the particle size to fine-tune hybrid adsorption characteristics of flexible-robust MOFs.

Although iridium-based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, their exorbitant cost and scarcity severely restrict their widespread application. Herein, we introduce a promising alternative to iridium: zinc-doped ruthenium dioxide (TE-Zn/RuO2), which exhibits remarkable and enduring activity for acidic OER. In situ characterizations elucidate that the dynamic cycling of zinc dopants serves as both electron acceptors and donors, facilitating the activation of Ru sites at low overpotentials while thwarting peroxidation at high overpotentials, thus concurrently achieving heightened activity and robust stability. Additionally, the incorporation of zinc induces weakened Ru–O covalency, thereby stabling *OOH intermediates and instigating a sustained adsorbate evolution mechanism, dramatically stabilizing the RuO2 lattice. Importantly, the TE-Zn/RuO2 catalyst as an anode exhibits good stability over 300 h at a water-splitting current of 500 mA cm–2 in the PEMWE device, underscoring its considerable promise for practical applications.

The single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) have garnered significant attention in recent years. The NRR is regarded as a milder and greener approach to ammonia synthesis. The pursuit of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for the NRR continues to garner substantial interest, yet it poses a significant challenge. In this study, we employed density functional theory calculations to investigate the stability and catalytic activity of 29 transition metal atoms loaded on the two-dimensional (2D) AlN monolayer with Al monovacancy (TM@AlN) for the conversion of N2 to NH3. After screening the activity and selectivity of NRR, it was found that Os@AlN exhibited the highest activity for NRR with a very low limiting potential of −0.46 V along the distal pathway. The analysis of the related electronic structure, Bader charge, electron localization function, and PDOS revealed the origin of NRR activity from the perspective of energy and electronic properties. The high activity and selectivity towards the NRR of SACs are closely associated with the Os-3N coordination. Our findings have expanded the scope of designing innovative high-efficiency SACs for NRR.

Novel (KNbO 3 ) 1− x (Ba 2 FeNbO 6 ) x ( x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) solid solutions corresponding to K 0.82 Ba 0.18 Fe 0.09 Nb 0.91 O 3 , K 0.64 Ba 0.36 Fe 0.18 Nb 0.82 O 3 , and K 0.46 Ba 0.54 Fe 0.27 Nb 0.73 O 3 compounds have been synthesized via molten salt method. X‐ray diffraction confirms the formation of solid solutions, while transmission electron microscopy combined with energy‐dispersive spectroscopy results demonstrates a homogeneous distribution of elements. The obtained solid solutions crystallized in a cubic crystal structure, whereas the parent KNbO 3 possesses an orthorhombic structure. The wide bandgap semiconductor KNbO 3 transformed into a visible‐light‐active material, with its bandgap energy reduced from 3.56 eV to ≈2.4 eV. The substitution of K in KNbO 3 with Ba is responsible for structural modification from orthorhombic to cubic symmetry, whereas both structural modification and the substitution of Nb with Fe correlated with optical properties. The photocatalytic activities of all obtained solid solutions are improved compared with the parent KNbO 3 and Ba 2 FeNbO 6 compounds for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. Among the series of solid solutions, K 0.82 Ba 0.18 Fe 0.09 Nb 0.91 O 3 photocatalysts show the highest MB removal efficiency owing to its relatively higher surface area, suppressed charge carrier recombination, and more negative conduction band edge. Moreover, K 0.82 Ba 0.18 Fe 0.09 Nb 0.91 O 3 photocatalyst (0.1 g) combined with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to form a novel photo‐Fenton system, achieving almost complete degradation of 100 mL of 10 mg L −1 MB dye in 30 min.

Pourbaix diagrams stand as a useful tool in assessing and visualizing materials' electrochemical stability and are widely used for electrocatalyst design. However, their reliability hinges on the accuracy of the chemical potentials of involved phases, which may bear uncertainties and can be significantly impacted by decision-making steps in the computational protocol. This study introduces a robust sensitivity analysis framework, exemplified through a detailed examination of the computational Pourbaix diagram of Ni, the oxides of which are used as high-activity and cost-friendly catalysts for many electrochemical reactions. Quantities of interest derived from the Pourbaix diagram include the appearance and stability domain of the catalytically active Ni oxide phases along with the onset electrochemical potentials of phase transitions. These metrics can guide the design of operational conditions for Ni oxide electrocatalysts. We find that the employed DFT exchange-correlation functional has the most significant influence on the computed Pourbaix diagram. Uncertainties on crystal structures, along with their related ab initio energetics, are also found to affect the size of the phase stability domain. Higher-order coupling among input parameters is found to play a crucial role in influencing the appearance and distribution of Ni phases in the diagram. Our findings suggest a need to consider variations and uncertainties associated with the computational procedures on predicted Pourbaix diagrams for materials design.

Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology is vital for a cleaner and more sustainable future, offering high efficiency, quiet operation, fuel flexibility, and zero‐emission energy production with versatile applications. The drawbacks of PEMFC include its high cost, susceptibility to degradation, and challenges in scaling up production for commercial use. The gas diffusion layer (GDL), the catalyst layer (CL), and the polymer electrolyte are all very important parts of fuel cell technology. Through the optimization of these components, researchers may strive to develop fuel cells that are more efficient, cost‐effective, durable, and high‐performing, therefore enabling the provision of clean and sustainable energy. In this article, we have reviewed the various components of GDL, CL, and polymer electrolyte materials and their impact on the performance of PEMFC. The various characteristics of the GDL such as porosity, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and carbon materials, are fully discussed in this review article. These topics also cover the CL’s properties, including the catalyst, carbon support, ionomer, and solvent. Explore the different polymer electrolytes that are based on aliphatic Nafion and aromatic hydrocarbons‐based membrane. Finally, this review paper gives suggestions for the way forward in regard to creating electrodes and electrolytes for PEMFCs that are cost‐effective, efficient, and durable.

Abstract Developing cost‐effective ruthenium (Ru)‐based HER electrocatalysts as alternatives to commercial Pt/C is crucial for the advancement of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, the strong hydrogen adsorption of Ru‐based catalysts restricts its activity. Herein, a strategy is reported to tune the electronic structure and improve mass transfer by implanting Ru atoms onto the (002) facet of two‐dimensional zeolitic imidazolate framework‐67 (Ru@ L ZIF (002) ) to optimize the d ‐band center ( ε d ) of Ru and the hydrogen spillover behavior. Benefiting from the ultrathin nanosheet structure and optimized ε d of Ru, the over‐strong H adsorption energy is weakened and the electron/mass transfer is facilitated. Ru@ L ZIF (002) exhibits an overpotential of 9.2 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a long‐lasting stability of 35 days at 100 mA cm −2 . The mass activity and price activity of Ru@ L ZIF (002) is 2.9 and 14.7 times higher than Pt/C, respectively. More impressively, Ru@ L ZIF (002) delivers a cell voltage of 2.01 V at a high current density of 4 A cm −2 in PEMWE. The excellent long‐term durability of 1200 hours operating at 4 A cm −2 with an ultralow decay rate of 7.5 × 10 −3 mV h −1 has been achieved, making it promising as a cost‐effective alternative to Pt/C catalyst for PEMWE applications.

Abstract Rutile RuO 2 is recognized for its outstanding acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and notable cost advantage compared to iridium oxide for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, the unsatisfactory stability of RuO 2 hinders its practical application. Here, we report a lattice modulation strategy to enhance both the OER activity and stability of RuO 2 . Interestingly, the newly synthesized Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 ‐RuO 2 , with Mo doped first and then Nb, presents the greatest lattice spacing and possesses an overpotential of merely 205 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , which significantly outperforms Nb 0.05 Mo 0.15 ‐RuO 2 (239 mV), where Nb was doped first followed by Mo, as well as the initial RuO 2 (323 mV). Remarkably, Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 ‐RuO 2 requires only 1.76 V to achieve 1 A cm −2 and exhibits exceptional stability in PEMWE testing, with a voltage rise of only 58 mV at 200 mA cm −2 for more than 80 h.

Abstract Ammonia (NH 3 ) is one of the most widely produced chemicals globally, primarily synthesized through the Haber‐Bosch process, which requires high temperatures and pressures. Dual‐site catalysts can activate N 2 and H 2 at spatially separated sites, enabling efficient NH 3 synthesis under milder conditions. Despite the rapid experimental progress of the dual‐site catalysts (e.g., Ni‐LaN), the feasibility and design of dual‐site catalysts are challenged recently. Herein, the different metal‐loaded metal nitride catalyst models are employed, and their activity map for NH 3 synthesis is explored by the first‐principles microkinetic simulation. The optimum active region of this type of dual‐site catalyst is identified in terms of the formation energy ( E v ) of nitrogen vacancy (N vac ) on metal nitride and the adsorption energy ( E H ) of hydrogen atom on metal cluster, with E v and E H ideally located around ≈1.50 and ≈−0.30 eV, respectively. This offers a framework for designing effective metal‐loaded metal nitride catalysts for NH 3 synthesis. Importantly, this trend aligns with and rationalizes the current experimental observations of metal‐loaded metal nitride reported for NH 3 synthesis. This theoretical work provides significant insights into NH 3 synthesis on dual‐site mechanism, and provides a rational direction for designing metal‐loaded metal nitride catalysts.
