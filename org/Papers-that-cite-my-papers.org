Platinum (Pt) has been documented as the top-tier fuel cell catalyst, yet it faces a notable challenge regarding its poor CO tolerance and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), particularly when using CO-contaminated blue and gray H 2 . Here, we present an interfacial metal coordination strategy to design a bifunctional platinum-cobalt (PtCo) intermetallic catalyst integrated with a tin-nitrogen-carbon (Sn–N–C) support, which forms Pt–Sn–N bonds that substantially boost both ORR activity and CO tolerance. The PtCo/Sn–N–C-made fuel cell achieves a topmost peak power density of 2.11 watts per square centimeter in 100 parts per million (ppm) of CO-containing H 2 , surpassing all previously reported PEMFCs. In addition, it operates stably at a rated voltage for over 710 hours in 100 ppm of CO/H 2 -air. This work demonstrates the feasibility of fuel cells directly using CO-contaminated gray & blue H 2 , paving the way for PEMFC-driven energy vehicles.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit tremendous advantages in the electrochemical N2 oxidation reaction (EN2OR) to HNO3, which is an eco-friendly alternative to the synthesis of conventional industrial nitric acid and nitrates, but methods to rationally design and rapidly screen high-efficiency EN2OR SACs are unclear. Herein, taking pyridinic nitrogen-doped graphene-supported SACs as an example, a simple descriptor has been proposed to evaluate the EN2OR performance through systematically constructing a surface reaction phase diagram. This descriptor is comprised of merely the geometric information and inherent atomic properties (occupied d electron number, electronegativity, and coordinate number) that can accurately predict the activity and selectivity of EN2OR, independent of DFT simulations. Based on this descriptor, high-throughput screening has been executed on partially N/C/O coordinated SACs, including 160 candidates; 13 candidates with the overpotential of less than 1.0 V are selected and then validated by DFT calculations with a mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 0.09 V, indicating the reliability of the descriptor. Meanwhile, the screened CoO2N2-G and RhO2N2-G SACs exhibit lower EN2OR overpotential of 0.64 and 0.68 V and more negative UL(EN2OR) - UL(OER) values of -0.34 and -0.44 V in comparison to other candidates, respectively, demonstrating the excellent activity and selectivity of EN2OR. This work offers a route to rapid discovery of high-performance SACs for EN2OR.

Nanozymes offer diverse therapeutic potentials for cancer treatment which is dependent on the development of nanomaterials. Quasi-metal-organic framework is a class of metal-organic framework-derived nanomaterials with a transition state from metal-organic frameworks towards metal oxide featuring porous structure and high activity. Herein an iron-based quasi-metal-organic framework nanozyme Q-MIL-53(Fe) is reported via a controlled deligandation strategy, exhibiting enhanced peroxidase-/catalase-mimic activity and glutathione depletion capacity, whose underlying mechanisms are studied via density functional theory calculations. Q-MIL-53(Fe) demonstrates biocompatibility and superior antitumor efficacy compared to pristine MIL-53(Fe). It can activate antitumor immune response by inducing ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death, promoting dendritic cell maturation and T lymphocytes infiltration. Furthermore, a combination of Q-MIL-53(Fe) and programmed cell death protein 1 antibody amplifies cancer immunotherapy. This study validates the antitumor activity of quasi-metal-organic frameworks and its immunotherapy induction potential. It would broaden the application of quasi-metal-organic frameworks and open avenues for developing antitumor nanozymes. Nanozymes offer diverse therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment. In this work, the authors report an iron-based quasi-metal organic framework nanozyme Q-MIL-53(Fe) with enhanced peroxidase and catalase-mimicking activity and glutathione depletion capacity and use it for tumor immunotherapy via inducing ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death.

The nitric oxide electroreduction reaction (NORR) has received considerable attention due to its importance in electrochemical denitrification of nitrogen oxides in groundwater and industrial waste gases and electrochemical ammonia synthesis. However, the detailed mechanism and the factors that affect product selectivity are far less understood. Employing coupled differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and attenuated total reflection-surface-enhanced infrared absorption (ATR-SEIRA) spectroscopy, adsorbed species and volatile solution products, during the adsorption of NO and NORR on Pt in both alkaline and acidic media, have been simultaneously studied, enabling us to correlate the potential-dependent product selectivity with the surface ad-species. NOad,M, NOad,B, NOad,L, and NO2,ad were identified using SEIRA spectroscopy as surface ad-species, with their potential-dependent intensities having a strong correlation with the product selectivity. N2O is the only reduction product at potentials beyond the hydrogen region and is attributed to the reduction of weakly adsorbed NO. In contrast, the formation of NH3 and NH2OH occurs only in the hydrogen region and is ascribed to the reaction between strongly adsorbed NO and adsorbed H. N2 is a minor product, and is formed through further reduction of N2O by adsorbed H. The formation of N2 is significantly suppressed in acidic media due to the fast kinetics of NO reduction to NH3/NH2OH, and thus lowering of NO coverage in the hydrogen region. To achieve the selective reduction of NO to NH3/NH2OH, the potential should remain at 0.1-0.2 V (vs RHE) in both acidic and alkaline media while a slow NO supply, and acidic media are preferred over alkaline media due to the faster kinetics. These new spectroscopic results and insights about the NORR could advance the design of more effective NORR catalysts and help develop optimal conditions for selective ammonia synthesis.

The rational design of heterojunctions by coupling two or more two-dimensional (2D) materials is regarded as a feasible strategy to efficiently enhance photocatalytic-hydrogen performance by capturing solar energy to address the increasing global energy crisis. In this work, a functional MoS2/ZnO heterojunction is proposed based on first-principles simulation. Our results reveal that the photogenerated electrons and holes in the MoS2/ZnO heterojunction follow a specific Z-scheme pathway, highly facilitating redox reactions and optimizing optical properties in the visible-light region. Under external strain, the MoS2/ZnO heterojunction demonstrates improved HER performance and remarkable optical-harvesting capabilities. Interestingly, the HER free energy for the heterojunction is only -0.04 eV under -5% compressive strain, highlighting its promising potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. We observe that the absorption edge of the spectrum shifts gradually to the infrared region with increasing tensile biaxial strains, whereas compressive biaxial strains result in a blue-shift absorption spectrum. Additionally, all heterojunctions achieve excellent solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies exceeding 10%, demonstrating their capability to store sufficient solar energy. Our work offers a novel strategy for exploring highly efficient photocatalysts in the field of hydrogen energy with the ability to modulate their activity through external strain.

Electrocatalysts can efficiently convert earth-abundant simple molecules into high-value-added products. In this context, heterostructures, which are largely determined by the interface, have emerged as a pivotal architecture for enhancing the activity of electrocatalysts. In this review, the atomistic understanding of heterostructured electrocatalysts is considered, focusing on the reaction kinetic rate and electron configuration, gained from both empirical studies and theoretical models. We start from the fundamentals of the microkinetic model, adsorption energy theory, and electric double layer model. The importance of heterostructures to accelerate electrochemical processes via modulating electron configuration and interfacial reactive microenvironment is highlighted, by considering rectification, space charge region, built-in electric field, synergistic interactions, lattice strain, and geometric effect. We conclude this review by summarizing the challenges and perspectives in the field of heterostructured electrocatalysts, such as the determination of transition state energy, their dynamic evolution, refinement of the theoretical approaches, and the use of machine learning.

Electrocatalysis is one of the principal pathways for the transition to sustainable chemistry, promising greater energy efficiency and reduced emissions. As the field has grown, our theoretical understanding has matured. The influence of the applied potential on reactivity has developed from the first-order predictions based on the Nernst equation to the implicit inclusion of second-order effects including the interaction of reacting species with the interfacial electric field. In this review, we explore these non-Nernstian field effects in electrocatalysis, aiming to both understand and exploit them through theory and computation. We summarize the critical distinction between Nernstian and non-Nernstian effects and outline strategies to address the latter in theoretical studies. Subsequently, we examine the specific energetic contributions of the latter on capacitive and faradaic processes separately. We also underscore the importance of considering non-Nernstian effects in catalyst screening and mechanistic analysis. Finally, we provide suggestions on how to experimentally unravel these effects, offering insights into practical approaches for advancing the field.

Abstract Machine learning (ML) methods enable prediction of the properties of chemical structures without computationally expensive ab initio calculations. The quality of such predictions depends on the reference data that was used to train the model. In this work, we introduce the QCML dataset: A comprehensive dataset for training ML models for quantum chemistry. The QCML dataset systematically covers chemical space with small molecules consisting of up to 8 heavy atoms and includes elements from a large fraction of the periodic table, as well as different electronic states. Starting from chemical graphs, conformer search and normal mode sampling are used to generate both equilibrium and off-equilibrium 3D structures, for which various properties are calculated with semi-empirical methods (14.7 billion entries) and density functional theory (33.5 million entries). The covered properties include energies, forces, multipole moments, and other quantities, e.g., Kohn-Sham matrices. We provide a first demonstration of the utility of our dataset by training ML-based force fields on the data and applying them to run molecular dynamics simulations.

AuPd is a miscible metal alloy that is often used in catalysis. Supported AuPd catalysts, at high Au/Pd ratios, form single-atom alloys (SAAs) that have been shown to enhance rates and/or selectivities for many catalytic reactions, including (de)hydrogenations, hydrogenolysis, and C–C and C–O coupling reactions. While many computational studies have examined the stability of AuPd structures (the arrangement of atoms within the miscible alloy), most focused on generic alloys rather than SAAs and those that have closely investigated SAAs focused on single crystal surfaces. In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate exchange energies (swapping an Au atom with a Pd atom) in a 201-atom truncated octahedral nanoparticle model with a focus on particles with high Au/Pd ratios. We calculate these exchange energies as a function of Pd location within the nanoparticle, the number of Pd atoms neighboring and near those exchange sites, and the total Pd content in the nanoparticle. These DFT-calculated exchange energies are also used to inform simple physics-based models (in contrast to cluster expansion or neural network models) that show good agreement with DFT-calculated values with relatively few regressed parameters. These models are then implemented into Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to predict the nanoparticle structure as a function of composition and temperature. The results show that Pd prefers to be in the subsurface of nanoparticles and that Pd prefers to be isolated from itself within Au. Both observations agree well with prior experimental and computational studies of single-crystal systems. We also show that the overall composition of the nanoparticle influences exchange energies by changing the electronic properties (e.g., Fermi level) of the system, which is relevant as Pd has one fewer valence electron than Au. MC simulations show that, in a vacuum, Pd begins to populate the surface of these ∼2 nm nanoparticles at around 20 mol % Pd (at 298 K) and that the number of Pd surface monomers, desired for SAA applications, goes through a maximum near 40 mol % Pd. As the temperature increases, Pd is more prevalent at the surface, but the influence of temperature is relatively muted. While AuPd structures are known to change in the presence of reactive gases (e.g., CO or O2), these studies characterize the baseline thermodynamic arrangements that can be used to understand surface restructuring during catalyst characterization and reaction studies.

Abstract Modulating the coordination environment of active centers has been proven to be an effective strategy for tuning the activity and selectivity of single‐atom catalysts (SACs). However, most current research primarily focuses on altering non‐metallic elements coordinating with the single metal atom. In this study, a novel approach is presented by introducing various vacancies into the first coordination shell of single‐atom doped boron–carbon–nitride (BCN) catalysts, systematically evaluating their hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions performances. Results indicate that the introduction of vacancy defects enhances the stability of M‐B X C Y N Z structures. Furthermore, adjusting the coordinating atoms around metal sites modulates charge distribution, influencing the binding propensity of intermediates on the adsorption sites and promoting synergistic effects between metal and nonmetal, thereby altering catalytic activity. Specifically, among 147 M‐B X C Y N Z and M‐B X C Y N Z ‐vacancy structures, 17 catalysts with excellent HER performance have been identified. Notably, C‐vacancy modulated Ni‐BC 2 N exhibits an OER overpotential of only 0.36V, suggesting that Ni‐BC 2 N‐C1 may serve as an efficient multifunctional electrocatalyst for water‐splitting reactions. This work employs vacancy engineering to precisely modulate the first coordination shell of single‐atom catalysts, not only screening out efficient HER/OER electrocatalysts but also providing guidance for the development of potential BCN‐based multifunctional electrocatalysts.

Abstract 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a highly promising candidates for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. This study presents the synthesis, comprehensive linear optical, and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) characterization of a novel 2D vdW semiconductor SnP 2 Se 6 in its bulk single crystal form. It exhibits an indirect bandgap of ≈1.47 eV and an exceptional non‐resonant SHG coefficient of d 33 ∼ −222 ± 30 pm V −1 at a fundamental wavelength of 2 µm, which is ≈7 times larger than that of the commercial AgGaSe 2 with a comparable bandgap. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the linear and nonlinear optical properties exhibit reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements, revealing the chemical origin of the enhanced properties. Moreover, SnP 2 Se 6 can exhibit both type‐I and type‐II phase matching over a wide spectral range, fulfilling one of the key criteria for an ideal NLO crystal. These exceptional properties position SnP 2 Se 6 as a highly promising candidate for NLO applications.

The synergistic Cu0-Cu+ sites is regarded as the active species towards NH3 synthesis from the nitrate electrochemical reduction reaction (NO3-RR) process. However, the mechanistic understanding and the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ remain exclusive. The big obstacle is that it is challenging to effectively regulate the interfacial motifs of Cu0-Cu+ sites. In this paper, we describe the tunable construction of Cu0-Cu+ interfacial structure by modulating the size-effect of Cu2O nanocube electrocatalysts to NO3-RR performance. We elucidate the formation mechanism of Cu0-Cu+ motifs by correlating the macroscopic particle size with the microscopic coordinated structure properties, and identify the synergistic effect of Cu0-Cu+ motifs on NO3-RR. Based on the rational design of Cu0-Cu+ interfacial electrocatalyst, we develop an efficient paired-electrolysis system to simultaneously achieve the efficient production of NH3 and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid at an industrially relevant current densities (2 A cm−2), while maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies, high yield rates, and long-term operational stability in a 100 cm2 electrolyzers, indicating promising practical applications. It is challenging to regulate the interfacial motifs of Cu0-Cu+ sites to understand roles of Cu0 and Cu+ for nitrate electrochemical reduction reaction. Here, the authors report a tunable construction of Cu0-Cu+ interfacial structure by modulating the size-effect of Cu2O electrocatalysts.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have displayed unprecedented activity and selectivity for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, a series of metal single atoms embedded on nitrogen-doped graphene (M–N4G, where M = In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, and Bi) is systematically evaluated as CO2RR electrocatalysts by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The computational results show that most M–N4G exhibit better CO2RR selectivity over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ge/Pb–N4G exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in the generation of HCOOH from the CO2RR with low limiting potentials of −0.292 and −0.306 eV, which surpass the performance of the vast majority of electrocatalysts. Adsorption energy of the key intermediate *HCOO can be used as an effective reactivity reaction descriptor to screen promising CO2RR catalysts. The results of this work highlight M–N4G as an ideal electrochemical for the electrocatalytic CO2RR.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR), with its low thermodynamic potential, offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for efficient hydrogen production. However, its sluggish kinetics still demand the development of an efficient electrocatalyst. In this study, the critical role of Ru doping in Fe₂TiO₅ is demonstrated to accelerate UOR kinetics. The computational finding confirmed the feasibility of this approach, guiding the experimental synthesis of Fe2-xRuxTiO5. Benefitting from surface properties and electronic structure, the synthesized material exhibits superior performance with a potential of 1.30 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for UOR, compared to undoped Fe2TiO5 (1.40 V). Moreover, it demonstrates a favourable Tafel slope of 52 mV dec-1 and maintains robust durability for 72 h. As confirmed from experimental and computational findings, the enhanced activity can be attributed to the Ru doping resulting in structural distortion at the Fe site and creation of a favourable adsorption site thereby enhancing UOR via dual active center. This study not only broadens the potential applications of Fe2TiO5-based materials beyond their traditional role as photocatalysts but also establishes them as promising electrocatalysts underscoring the versatility and improved performance of Fe2-xRuxTiO5.

The development of highly active metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) is crucial for energy conversion and storage, offering optimized atom utilization and high catalytic activity, with bifunctional SACs for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) reactions providing greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness than monofunctional catalysts, making them scientifically and economically valuable. By integrating density functional theory and machine learning methods, we systematically evaluated the potential of TM–N2@C15N5S3H5 monolayers as efficient HER/OER/ORR catalysts, revealing that 27 TM atoms remain stable on N2@C15N5S3H5 with a TM–N2 coordination environment. Rh–N2@C15N5S3H5 outperforms Pt in HER, while Rh–N2@C15N5S3H5 drives both HER and OER, while Ni–N2@C15N5S3H5 catalyzes OER and ORR, making them bifunctional catalysts. Comparative activity analysis reveals that the Ni-d orbitals in Ni–N2@C15N5S3H5 interact with O-p orbitals, pairing up electrons from antibonding states into downward bonding orbitals, thus fitting OH* adsorption and enhancing catalytic performance. We further examined the pH and applied potential effects on OER/ORR performance of Ni–N2@C15N5S3H5 and Rh–N2@C15N5S3H5 monolayers, both show enhanced OER in acidic conditions, with Ni–N2@C15N5S3H5 excelling in ORR under alkaline conditions and Rh–N2@C15N5S3H5 in acidic conditions. Moreover, machine learning techniques were applied to explore the correlation between catalytic activity and a range of structural and atomic properties.

Abstract Developing efficient and sustainable carbon sorbent for mercury vapor (Hg 0 ) capture is significant to public health and ecosystem protection. Here we show a carbon material, namely graphdiyne with accessible sp -hybridized carbons (HsGDY), that can serve as an effective “trap” to anchor Hg atoms by strong electron-metal-support interaction, leading to the in-situ adsorption-coupled-oxidation of Hg. The adsorption process is benefited from the large hexagonal pore structure of HsGDY. The oxidation process is driven by the surface charge heterogeneity of HsGDY which can itself induce the adsorbed Hg atoms to lose electrons and present a partially oxidized state. Its good adaptability and excellent regeneration performance greatly broaden the applicability of HsGDY in diverse scenarios such as flue gas treatment and mercury-related personal protection. Our work demonstrates a sp -hybridized carbon material for mercury vapor capture which could contribute to sustainability of mercury pollution industries and provide guide for functional carbon material design.

Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis is a core reaction in renewable energy devices, greatly promoting the transformation and upgrading of the energy structure. Nonetheless, the performance of energy conversion devices is hindered by the large overpotential and slow kinetics of oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Recently, single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as promising contenders in the field of oxygen electrocatalysis because of their exceptional metal atom utilization, distinctive coordination environment, and adjustable electronic properties. This review presents the latest advancements in the design of Co‐based SACs for oxygen electrocatalysis. First, the OER and ORR mechanisms are introduced. Subsequently, the strategies for regulating the electronic structure of Co‐based SACs are summarized in three aspects, including coordination environment, metal centers, and support carriers. A particular emphasis is given to the relationship between the structure and properties of catalysts. Afterward, the latest applications of Co‐based SACs in energy conversion devices are explored. Ultimately, the challenges and prospects for Co‐based SACs are prospected.

Abstract Wide‐bandgap spinel oxides, such as ZnAl 2 O 4 (ZAO) and ZnCr 2 O 4 (ZCO), are traditionally limited by poor electron activation under light irradiation, resulting in suboptimal photocatalytic performance. This study investigates a novel approach to overcoming these limitations by leveraging the flexoelectric effect in centrosymmetric porous nanoparticles with wrinkled surfaces. The inhomogeneous strain gradients generated under mechanical force induce flexoelectric polarization, offering a promising pathway to enhance photocatalytic activity. ZAO outperforms ZCO due to the smaller atomic radius of aluminum, allowing greater atomic displacement and higher polarization, which prolongs electron‐hole recombination. Oxygen vacancies (O V ) further enhance ZAO performance, with ZAO‐200 (annealed at 200 °C) achieving the longest carrier lifetime (4.65 ns) and an exceptional hydrogen evolution rate of 3737 µmol g −1 h −1 —206% higher than pristine ZAO—without light stimulation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm a lower hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) energy barrier for ZAO (ΔG H = −0.13 eV) compared to ZCO (1.34 eV) and reveal spontaneous water splitting at O V sites without energy input. A unique butterfly curve validates flexoelectric potential generation from strain gradients. These findings establish a novel framework for eco‐friendly hydrogen production, demonstrating that flexoelectric polarization and O V engineering can surpass traditional photocatalytic methods in sustainability and efficiency.

Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) show promise because of their efficient use of precious metals, unique coordination and electronic structures, and excellent tunability. Photocatalysis can harvest solar energy to drive energetically unfavorable reactions under mild conditions, offering a sustainable alternative to energy‐intensive reactions. However, the efficiency of solar photocatalysis is limited by poor solar spectrum utilization and rapid charge recombination. Integrating single atoms into semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising route to address these limitations. Mechanistic understanding of single‐atom photocatalysis is crucial for developing efficient catalysts as they guide effective material design. This work provides an overview of the current knowledge on platinum group SACs applied to photocatalytic applications with a focus on the role of single atoms in photocatalytic reactions. The review begins with a summary of the unique advantages of platinum group metal SACs as well as their common structures. A concise summary of synthesis methods is then provided, followed by a comprehensive review of characterization methods for SAC structure, photoelectronic properties, and mechanisms of action. Next, the role of single atoms in improving general photocatalytic processes as well as specific reactions are discussed. Finally, future outlooks for SAC development are included to guide further advancements in the field.

ABSTRACT Metal nitrides have emerged as promising materials for photoelectrochemical and electrochemical catalysis due to their unique electronic properties and structural versatility, offering high electrical conductivity and abundant active sites for catalytic reactions. Herein, we comprehensively explore the characteristics, synthesis, and application of diverse metal nitride catalysts. Fundamental features and catalytic advantages of metal nitrides are presented in terms of electronic structure and surface chemistry. We deal with synthetic principles and parameters of metal nitride catalysts in terms of nitrogen source, introducing synthesis strategies of metal nitrides with various morphologies and phases. Recent progress of metal nitride catalysts in (photo)electrochemical reactions, such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, nitrogen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and biomass valorization reactions, is discussed with their tailored roles. By providing future direction for remaining challenges, this review aims to guide the design of metal nitride catalysts from a materials point of view, contributing to expanding into energy and environmental technologies.

The aim of this study is to investigate the activity and stability of carbon aerogel‐supported platinum electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, compared to current solutions based on carbon black. Self‐synthesized carbon aerogels (pyrolyzed cellulose, and chitosan‐based aerogels) with multiscale porosity and high overall specific surface area (up to ≈2500 m 2 g −1 ), as well as Vulcan XC‐72R supports were loaded via supercritical deposition (SCD) with platinum nanoparticles (mean particle diameter ≈1.3–2.0 nm, 2.8–3.8 wt% Pt loading). Overpotentials ranged from 46.5 to 50.0 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , whereas self‐synthesized electrocatalysts had similar overpotentials as compared to a commercial catalyst with ≈8–10 times higher Pt loading. In addition, Pt‐carbon aerogel electrocatalysts had higher stability and durability as compared to Pt‐Vulcan, most probably due to the high micro‐ to mesoporosity of carbon aerogels, which promotes nanoparticle stability. The current density at 40 mV for Pt‐Vulcan decreased by 80% after 20 h, whereas an insignificant drop was observed for Pt‐carbon aerogels. These results show that the applied combination of materials (biopolymer‐based carbon aerogels) and loading method (SCD) are a promising approach for synthesizing stable electrocatalysts with reduced platinum content for green hydrogen production.

Abstract Core‐shell nanoparticles are an important class of catalytic materials due to the presence of unsaturated bonds, phase‐separated metals, and synergistic effect of more than one elements. Exploring the electronic properties such as the ‐band center () and the related catalytic properties of these materials are quite challenging due to resource consuming experiments and computationally expensive modeling of the nanoparticles. Therefore, a density functional theory (DFT) coupled recommendation system based approach is developed to predict the of the core‐shell nanoparticles. Here, the recommendation system involves completion of a core‐shell interaction matrix, where each matrix element represents the of a unique core‐shell pair. Matrix completion by predicting the interaction matrix elements is carried out using neural network. The neural network generated a low dimensional representations for each core and shell metals, which are learned iteratively to predict corresponding of the pair. The learned representations brilliantly captures the similarities and dissimilarities between metals present in shell or core. A very low train/test RMSE of 0.009/0.009 is obtained with elemental features based model. The same model is further employed to predict the ‐band width (), suggesting its transferability. This approach recommends the optimum range of / along with the combination of core‐shell metals having most efficient adsorption of species for any reaction. The results presented in this study can help experimentally design the core‐shell nanoparticles having a desired catalytic activity.

We propose a mechanism for generating single photons in the mid-infrared (MIR) using a solid-state or molecular quantum emitter. The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.

Since photocatalytic and electrocatalytic technologies are crucial for tackling the energy and environmental challenges, significant efforts have been put into exploring advanced catalysts. Among them, perovskite type ABO3 oxides show great promising catalytic activities because of their flexible physical and chemical properties. In this review, the fundamentals and recent progress in the synthesis of perovskite type ABO3 oxides are considered. We describe the mechanisms for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions (OER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR), carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RR), and metal-air batteries in details. Furthermore, the photocatalytic water splitting, CO2 conversion, pollutant degradation, and nitrogen fixation are reviewed as well. We also stress the applications of perovskite type ABO3 oxides in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFs). Finally, the optimization of perovskite type ABO3 oxides for applications in various fields and an outlook on the current and future challenges are depicted. The aim of this review is to present a broad overview of the recent advancements in the development of perovskite type ABO3 oxides-based catalysts and their applications in energy conversion and environmental remediation, as well as to present a roadmap for future development in these hot research areas.

Polyimide-based dielectric materials, as excellent high-temperature-resistant polymers, play a crucial role in advanced electronic devices and power systems. However, given the limitations of composite PI materials, it is a significant challenge to simultaneously improve the dielectric constant and breakdown strength of intrinsic polyimide dielectric materials to achieve high energy density. In this study, an indiscriminate copolymerization method was proposed, which utilizes two different diamine monomers with bulky side groups (-CF3) and high polarity (C-O-C), respectively, to copolymerize with the same dianhydride monomer and prepare a series of intrinsic PI films. Remarkably, PI films with a highly dipolar rigid backbone maintain excellent thermal and mechanical properties while enhancing dipole polarization. Meanwhile, a high breakdown strength of PI is shown, because the bulky side groups act as deep traps to capture and disperse charges during the charge transfer process. Under the optimal copolymer ratio, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss are 4.2 and 0.008, respectively. At room temperature, the highest breakdown strength reaches 493MV/m, and the energy storage density and charge–discharge efficiency are 5.07 J/cm3 and 82%, respectively. Finally, based on density functional theory calculations, the copolymerization tendencies of the three monomers are verified, and it is speculated that the copolymerization ratio of PI-60% is the most stable and exhibits the best overall performance, which perfectly aligns with the experimental results. These experimental results demonstrate the exciting potential of intrinsic polyimide in thin film capacitors.
