Abstract Correlating the bond strength with the macro strength of metals is crucial for understanding mechanical properties and designing multi-principal-element alloys (MPEAs). Motivated by the role of grain boundaries in the strength of metals, we introduce a predictive model to determine the grain-boundary energies and strength of metals from the cohesive energy and atomic radius. This scheme originates from the d-band characteristics and broken-bond spirit of tight-binding models, and demonstrates that the repulsive/attractive effects play different roles in the variation of bond strength for different metals. Importantly, our framework not only applies to both pure metals and MPEAs, but also unravels the distinction of the bond strength caused by elemental compositions, lattice structures, high-entropy, and amorphous effects. These findings build a physical picture across bond strength, grain-boundary energies and strength of metals by using easily accessible material properties and provide a robust method for the design of high-strength alloys.

The formation of non-ion conducting byproducts on zinc anode is notoriously detrimental to aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, we successfully transform a representative detrimental byproduct, crystalline zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) to fast-ion conducting solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) via amorphization and fluorination induced by suspending CaF2 nanoparticles in dilute sulfate electrolytes. Distinct from widely reported nonhomogeneous organic–inorganic hybrid SEIs that exhibit structural and chemical instability, the designed single-phase SEI is homogeneous, mechanically robust, and chemically stable. These characteristics of the SEI facilitate the prevention of zinc dendrite growth and reduction of capacity loss during long-term cycling. Importantly, AZIB full cells based on this SEI-forming electrolyte exhibit exceptional stability over 20,000 cycles at 3 A/g with a charging voltage of 2.2 V without short circuits and electrolyte dry-out. This work suggests avenues for designing SEIs on a metal anode and provides insights into associated SEI chemistry.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) promise quantum-level accuracy at classical force field speeds, but their performance hinges on the quality and diversity of training data. An efficient and fully automated approach to sample chemical reaction space without relying on human intuition, addressing a critical gap in MLIP development is presented. The method combines the speed of tight-binding calculations with selective high-level refinement, generating diverse datasets that capture both equilibrium and reactive regions of potential energy surfaces. By employing single-ended growing string and nudged elastic band methods, reaction pathways previously underrepresented in MLIP training sets, particularly near transition states are systematically explored. This approach yields datasets with rich structural and chemical diversity, essential for robust MLIP development. Open-source code is provided for the entire workflow, facilitating the integration of the approach into existing MLIP development pipelines.

Abstract The conversion of nitrate‐rich wastewater and biomass‐derived blocks into high‐value products using renewably generated electricity is a promising approach to modulate the artificial carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, a new synthetic strategy of WO x sub‐nanoclusters is reported and supported on carbon materials as novel efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and its coupling with α‐keto acids. In acidic solutions, the NH 3 ‐NH 2 OH selectivity can also optimized by adjusting the potential, with the total FE exceeding 80% over a wide potential range. After introducing α‐keto acids, the WO x /D‐CB electrode achieves remarkable activity and selectivity toward C 2 ‐C 6 amino acids. For glycine and alanine, impressive FEs of 49.34% and 38.22% based on transitional metal oxides can be obtained, surpassing those of WO x nanoclusters with larger size. In situ analysis and mechanistic studies reveal the critical role of WO x sub‐nanoclusters in reducing the energy barriers of key steps in alanine synthesis. This work opens up new insights into the rational design of cluster catalysts to promote electrochemical amino acid synthesis.

The adsorption/desorption behavior of sulfur species at the (111) surfaces of pure Pt and various Pt-based bimetallic alloys, denoted as Pt3M (M = Co, Cu, Fe, Pd), was investigated by electrochemical measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After the adsorption of elemental sulfur, the current responses characteristic of the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen and hydroxyl species at the sulfur-free bare (111) surfaces completely disappeared, and a doublet peak corresponding to the elemental sulfur appeared in the S 2p region of XPS spectra. The characteristic current responses gradually recovered, simultaneously with the decrease of the S 2p peak, by repeating the potential cycling between −0.2 and 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl, indicating the oxidative desorption of S species. Except for the Pt3Pd(111) surface, in which Pd has a similar atomic radius to Pt and fully occupied 4d orbitals, the Pt3M(111) surfaces showed higher oxidative desorption capability than those of the pure Pt(111) surface; electrochemically active surface area recovered at the Pt3M(111) surfaces by fewer potential cycles than at the Pt(111) surface. Among the various factors, the downshift of the d-band center due to the ligand effect of foreign metal and the electronic interaction between adsorbed S and Pt are the dominant factors promoting the oxidative desorption of sulfur as well as the strain effect of foreign metal with an atomic radius smaller than Pt.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted widespread attention due to their potential to replace platinum-based catalysts in achieving efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the rational optimization of SACs remains challenging due to their elusive reaction mechanisms. Herein, by employing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and a thermodynamic integration method, we have constructed the potential-dependent free energetics of ORR on a single iron atom catalyst dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe-N4/C) and further integrated these parameters into a microkinetic model. We demonstrate that the rate-determining step (RDS) of the ORR on SACs is potential-dependent rather than invariant within the operative potential range. Specifically, under the charge-neutral condition, the RDS is calculated to be water desorption with the highest barrier, while as the potential increases, it gradually transitions to the protonation of *OH species, O2* species, and O* species, regardless of the protonation of *OH species as the potential-determining step. Moreover, we reveal the critical role of the dynamic adsorption of axially adsorbed water in facilitating the release of the single-atom site, thus enhancing the ORR rate. Our work has resolved the long-standing controversies over the RDS of ORR on SACs and implies that the step with the lowest exothermicity is not always synonymous with the RDS, highlighting the importance of examining the kinetic barriers under realistic potential conditions for understanding the electrocatalytic performance.

The relaxation of atomic positions to their optimal structural arrangement is crucial for understanding the emergence of new physical behavior in long scale superstructures in twisted bilayers of two-dimensional materials. The amount of deviation from a rigid moiré structure will depend on the elastic properties of the constituent monolayers which, for the twisted bilayer, the more flexible the monolayers are, the lower the energy required to deform the layers to maximize the areas with an energetically optimal interlayer arrangement of atoms. We investigate this atomic reconstruction for twisted bilayers of highly flexible InSe. Results using two methods are demonstrated: first we train a machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) to enable fully atomistic relaxations of small-twist-angle large-length-scale moiré supercells while retaining density functional theory (DFT) level accuracy. We find substantial out-of-plane corrugation and in-plane domain formation for a wide range of twist angles and moiré length scales. We then adapt an existing continuum approach and show that it can reproduce some, but not all, features of the fully atomistic calculations. Published by the American Physical Society 2025

Alloy nanoparticles based on platinum group metals (PGMs) have been intensively investigated in various fields, especially in catalysis. Recently, the scope of alloying has expanded to include not only d‐block transition metals but also p‐block elements, which have a wide range of properties that are very different from those of d‐block transition metals. By alloying PGMs with p‐block elements, the electronic structure and surface properties of the catalysts can be tuned, enhancing their catalytic performance. The focus of this review is on PGM–p‐block element nanoalloys, their synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and catalytic properties. In addition to typical binary crystalline alloys, such as solid‐solution and intermetallic alloys, this review also highlights the potential of multielement, amorphous, or liquid alloys, which have recently garnered much attention. The review aims to provide valuable perspectives for the development of PGM‐based sustainable and innovative catalysis, while also addressing the current challenges and future directions in this field.

Abstract Electrocatalysis advances rely on the development of efficient catalysts. Systematic material design hinges on identifying activity and selectivity descriptors. While adsorption energy descriptors have helped predict new materials, they are typically based on pure metals, uncertain of their applicability to complex materials like alloys. Here, we systematically analyze the validity of descriptor models for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). For this, we prepare gold, silver, and palladium alloys of variable composition and confirm experimentally the continuous variation of the d-band center (i.e. the CO adsorption energy) and work function (i.e. the potential of zero charge). Our results indicate that while the d-band center is the decisive factor for CO production, it, along with the work function, fails to fully explain the production of HCOO− and H2. Designing a copper-like alloy based on the matching of these descriptor values showed no formation of C2 products (as commonly expected for copper). This breakdown of the descriptor model is explained from first-principles calculations by the heterogeneity of the surface leading to different deactivation pathways for C2 product formation. Our results highlight the problems in transferring conventional descriptor models to more complex, heterogeneous materials motivating future developments.

Abstract Inducing magnetic ordering in a non‐ferrous layered double hydroxides (LDHs) instigates higher spin polarization, which leads to enhanced efficiency during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In nano‐sized magnetic materials, the concept of elongated grains drives domain alignment under the application of an external magnetic field. Hence, near the solid electrode interface, modified magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) positively impacts the electrocatalytic ability of non‐ferrous nanocatalysts. Consequently, significant improvement in the water‐splitting kinetics can be obtained by using even low magnetic fields. At 100 Gauss, 20% and 10% decrement in the overpotential is reported for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are also presented to explain the thermodynamics of the HER/OER processes. It is established that the Gibbs energy of the process can reduce the exchange energy barrier by using dopant like cobalt. The additional cobalt metal active site have the highest probability for adsorption of reactive intermediates during HER and OER, which results in higher efficiencies.
