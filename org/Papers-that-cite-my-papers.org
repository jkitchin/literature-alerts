We predict topological magnetic properties of B20 systems, that are organized in atomically thin multilayers. In particular, we focus on FeSi/CoSi and FeSi/FeGe superlattices with different numbers of layers and interface structures. We demonstrate that the absence of long-range magnetic order, previously observed in bulk FeSi and CoSi, is broken near the FeSi/CoSi interface, where a magnetic state with a nontrivial topological texture appears. Using the Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions calculated from first principles, we perform finite-temperature atomistic spin dynamics simulations for up to 2×106 spins to capture the complexity of noncollinear textures. Our simulations predict the formation of antiskyrmions in a [001]-oriented FeSi/CoSi multilayer, intermediate skyrmions in a [111]-oriented FeSi/CoSi system, and Bloch skyrmions in the FeSi/FeGe (001) system, with a size between 7 and 37 nm. These varieties of topological magnetic textures in the studied systems can be attributed to the complex asymmetric structure of the DM matrix, which is different from previously known magnetic materials. We demonstrate that through structural engineering both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized, where the latter are especially appealing for applications due to the zero skyrmion Hall effect. The proposed B20 multilayers show a potential for further exploration and call for experimental confirmation. Published by the American Physical Society 2024

Abstract Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered attention as potential catalysts for water splitting owing to their unique structures, diverse electronic properties, and composition from earth‐abundant elements. While certain TMD catalysts, notably MoS 2 , have shown promising activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), achieving performance comparable to traditional platinum catalysts remains a challenge. While significant effort has been invested into understanding the effect of TMD's structural properties, such as defectiveness and crystalline phases, recent work has emphasized the role of extrinsic factors on HER. This review summarizes the current understanding of the impact of commonly overlooked electrocatalytic effects that exhibit an enhanced importance in TMD‐based HER. By combining recent advances in theoretical modeling and experimental work, we review the dominating effects of extrinsic factors including electronic resistance, interfacial barriers, surface roughness, oxidation, and valence impurities. Our work aims to provide insights into optimizing TMDs as highly efficient catalysts for HER, facilitating future advancements in hydrogen generation technology.

Abstract Traditionally, Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis is performed using thermal catalysts and syngas (CO and H 2 ) under high‐pressure and high‐temperature conditions. However, this study introduces an approach that relies on FT chemistry assisted by electrochemistry, referred to here as direct electrochemical (EC) FT chemistry, under ambient conditions. A series of CH 4 , C n H 2n , and C n H 2n+2 hydrocarbons (n = 1–7) is successfully produced over gold (Au) nanoparticle‐loaded perovskite strontium titanate (SrTiO 3 ) nanostructures grown on rutile TiO 2 supported on Ti. Au (1.0 nm)–SrTiO 3 shows the best interface formation, with the highest Faradaic efficiency for C 2+ hydrocarbons. This direct EC‐FT process proceeds via a C─C coupling chain growth reaction at the Au‐SrTiO 3 interface as evidenced by the hydrocarbon weight distribution analysis and density functional theory calculations. The robust combination of experimental and computational findings reveals that optimum conditions for producing surface hydrogenation and C─C coupling polymerization, initiated by surface * CO and * H are achieved by controlling the undercoordinated Au at the perimeter sites of supported Au nanoparticles and by ensuring a harmonized density of states between Au and SrTiO 3 . This EC‐FT process opens a promising avenue for the direct conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O into value‐added long‐chain hydrocarbons.

The development of highly efficient and durable alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is crucial for achieving high-performance practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) at ampere-level current density. Herein, we report a design concept by employing Ga single atoms as an electronic bridge to stabilize the Ru clusters for boosting alkaline HER performance in practical AEMWE. Experimental and theoretical results collectively reveal that the bridged Ga sites trigger strong metal-support interaction for the homogeneous distribution of Ru clusters with high density, as well as optimize the Ru-H bond strength due to the electron transfer between Ru and Ga for enhanced intrinsic HER activity. Moreover, the oxophilic Ga sites near the Ru clusters tend to adsorb the hydroxyl species and accelerate the water dissociation for sufficient proton supplement in an alkaline medium. The Ru-Ga

Abstract Among various products from electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (CO 2 ER), HCOOH is highly profitable one. However, the slow kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction lowers overall energy efficiency, which can be replaced by an electro‐oxidation reaction with low thermodynamic potential and fast kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolysis system coupling CO 2 ER with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR). A BiOCl–CuO catalyst was designed to sustain CO 2 ER to HCOOH at partial current density of 500 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 90% and 700 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 80%. In situ and ex situ x‐ray absorption fine structure was used to capture the structure transform of BiOCl–CuO into metallic Bi and Cu during CO 2 ER process, and the presence of CuO will promote this transformation which are supported by DFT calculations. Coupling HMFOR with CO 2 ER, we realize both FE HCOOH and FE FDCA above 95% simultaneously, providing new prospects vista for the electrosynthesis of value‐added products from paired system.

The strengths of glasses are intricately linked to their atomic-level heterogeneity. Atomistic simulations are frequently used to investigate the statistical physics of this relationship, compensating for the limited spatiotemporal resolution in experimental studies. However, theoretical insights are limited by the complexity of glass structures and the accuracy of the interatomic potentials used in simulations. Here, we investigate the strengths and fracture mechanisms of 2D silica, with all structural units accessible to direct experimental observation. We develop a neural network force field for fracture based on the deep potential-smooth edition framework. Representative atomic structures across crystals, nanocrystalline, paracrystalline, and continuous random network glasses are studied. We find that the virials or bond lengths control the initialization of bond-breaking events, creating nanoscale voids in the vitreous network. However, the voids do not necessarily lead to crack propagation due to a disorder-trapping effect, which is stronger than the lattice-trapping effect in a crystalline lattice, and occurs over larger length and time scales. Fracture initiation proceeds with void growth and coalescence and advances through a bridging mechanism. The fracture patterns are shaped by subsequent trapping and cleavage steps, often guided by voids forming ahead of the crack tip. These heterogeneous processes result in atomically smooth facets in crystalline regions and rough, amorphous edges in the glassy phase. These insights into 2D crystals and glasses, both sharing SiO2 chemistry, highlight the pivotal role of atomic-level structures in determining fracture kinetics and crack path selection in materials.

First-principles electronic structure simulations are an invaluable tool for understanding chemical bonding and reactions. While machine-learning models such as interatomic potentials significantly accelerate the exploration of potential energy surfaces, electronic structure information is generally lost. Particularly in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, simulated electron band structures provide fundamental insights into catalytic reactivity. This ab initio knowledge is preserved in semiempirical methods such as density functional tight binding (DFTB), which extend the accessible computational length and time scales beyond first-principles approaches. In this paper we present Shell-Optimized Atomic Confinement (SOAC) DFTB electronic-part-only parametrizations for bulk and surface band structures of all

Diamond is a semiconductor material with remarkable structural, thermal, and electronic properties that has garnered significant interest in the field of electronics. Although hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) terminations are conventionally favored in transistor designs, alternative options, such as silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), are being explored because of their resilience to harsh processing conditions during fabrication. Density-functional theory was used to examine the non-oxidized and oxidized group-IV (Si and Ge)-terminated diamond (100) surfaces. The (3 × 1) reconstructed surfaces feature an ether configuration and show relative stability compared with the bare surface. Hybrid-functional calculations of the electronic properties revealed reduced fundamental bandgaps (&lt;1 eV) and lower negative electron affinities (NEAs) than those of H-terminated diamond surfaces, which is attributed to the introduction of unoccupied Si (Ge) states and the depletion of negative charges. Furthermore, oxidation of these surfaces enhanced the stability of the diamond surfaces but resulted in two structural configurations: ether and ketone. Oxidized ether configurations displayed insulating properties with energy gaps of ∼4.3 ± 0.3 eV, similar to H-terminated diamond (100) surfaces, whereas bridged ether configurations exhibited metallic properties. Oxidization of the metallic ketone configurations leads to the opening of relatively smaller gaps in the range of 1.1–1.7 eV. Overall, oxidation induced a shift from NEAs to positive electron affinities, except for the reverse-ordered ketone surface with an NEA of −0.94 eV, a value comparable to the H-terminated diamond (100) surfaces. In conclusion, oxidized group-IV-terminated diamond surfaces offer enhanced stability compared to H-terminated surfaces and display unique structural and electronic properties that are influenced by surface bonding.

Automatic differentiation (AD) emerged as an integral part of machine learning, accelerating model development by enabling gradient-based optimization without explicit analytical derivatives. Recently, the benefits of AD and computing arbitrary-order derivatives with respect to any variable were also recognized in the field of quantum chemistry. In this work, we present dxtb—an open-source, fully differentiable framework for semiempirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods. Developed entirely in Python and leveraging PyTorch for array operations, dxtb facilitates extensibility and rapid prototyping while maintaining computational efficiency. Through comprehensive code vectorization and optimization, we essentially reach the speed of compiled xTB programs for high-throughput calculations of small molecules. The excellent performance also scales to large systems, and batch operability yields additional benefits for execution on parallel hardware. In particular, energy evaluations are on par with existing programs, whereas the speed of automatically differentiated nuclear derivatives is only 2 to 5 times slower compared to their analytical counterparts. We showcase the utility of AD in dxtb by calculating various molecular and spectroscopic properties, highlighting its capacity to enhance and simplify such evaluations. Furthermore, the framework streamlines optimization tasks and offers seamless integration of semiempirical quantum chemistry in machine learning, paving the way for physics-inspired end-to-end differentiable models. Ultimately, dxtb aims to further advance the capabilities of semiempirical methods, providing an extensible foundation for future developments and hybrid machine learning applications. The framework is accessible at https://github.com/grimme-lab/dxtb.

Abstract All-solid-state Li-metal batteries can conceivably improve the safety and extend the driving ranges of electric vehicles. In this regard, the garnet-type solid electrolyte Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZ) has garnered considerable attention because of its high Li-ion conductivity and nonreactivity towards molten Li metal. Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a universal neural network potential (UNNP) to analyse the Li-ion exchange at the LLZ/Li interface at the atomic scale. The UNNP-MD calculations show that Li ions traverse the LLZ/Li interface and that excess Li ions relative to the stoichiometric composition accumulate in an approximately 1 nm-thick zone near the LLZ phase interface, signifying the formation of a space-charge layer. Electronic structural analysis of the UNNP-MD-derived configuration, performed using density functional theory calculations, reveals band bending near the LLZ phase interface and the simultaneous suppression of Li metal reduction. These findings can help expedite the development of rationally designed all-solid-state Li-metal batteries.

Abstract NiFe‐based nanomaterials are extensively studied as one of the promising candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their practical application is still largely impeded by the unsatisfied activity and poor durability caused by the severe leaching of active species. Herein, a rapid and facile combustion method is developed to synthesize the vertical graphene (VG) supported N‐doped carbon modified (Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se composites (NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG). The interconnected heterostructure of obtained materials plays a vital role in boosting the catalytic performance, offering rich active sites and convenient pathways for rapid electron and ion transport. The incorporation of Se into NiFe facilitates the formation of active species via in situ surface reconstruction. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the in situ formation of a Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 Se/Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 OOH layer significantly enhances the catalytic activity of NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG. Furthermore, the surface‐adsorbed selenoxide species contribute to the stabilization of the catalytic active phase and increase the overall stability. The obtained NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG exhibits a low overpotential of 220 mV at 20 mA cm −2 and long‐term stability over 300 h. This work offers a novel perspective on the design and fabrication of OER electrocatalysts with high activity and stability.

Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) represent a cutting-edge advancement in nanomaterials, merging the high catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes with the benefits of atomic economy. Traditionally, natural enzymes exhibit high specificity and efficiency, but their stability are limited by environmental conditions and production costs. Here we show that SAzymes, with their large specific surface area and high atomic utilization, achieve superior catalytic activity. However, their high dispersibility poses stability challenges. Our review focuses on recent structural and preparative advancements aimed at enhancing the catalytic specificity and stability of SAzymes. Compared to previous nanozymes, SAzymes demonstrate significantly improved performance in biomedical applications, particularly in tumor medicine. This progress positions SAzymes as a promising tool for future cancer treatment strategies, integrating the robustness of inorganic materials with the specificity of biological systems. The development and application of SAzymes could revolutionize the field of biocatalysis, offering a stable, cost-effective alternative to natural enzymes.

Machine learning techniques have significantly transformed the way materials scientists conduct research. However, the widespread deployment of machine learning software in daily experimental and simulation research for materials and chemical design has been limited. This is partly due to the substantial time investment and learning curve associated with mastering the necessary codes and computational environments. In this paper, we introduce a user-friendly, data-driven machine learning interface featuring multiple "button-clicking" functionalities to streamline the design of materials and chemicals. This interface automates the processes of transforming materials and molecules, performing feature selection, constructing machine learning models, making virtual predictions, and visualizing results. Such automation accelerates materials prediction and analysis in the inverse design process, aligning with the time criteria outlined by the Materials Genome Initiative. With simple button clicks, researchers can build machine learning models and predict new materials once they have gathered experimental or simulation data. Beyond the ease of use, NJmat offers three additional features for data-driven materials design: (1) automatic feature generation for both inorganic materials (from chemical formulas) and organic molecules (from SMILES), (2) automatic generation of Shapley plots, and (3) automatic construction of "white-box" genetic models and decision trees to provide scientific insights. We present case studies on surface design for halide perovskite materials encompassing both inorganic and organic species. These case studies illustrate general machine learning models for virtual predictions as well as the automatic featurization and Shapley/genetic model construction capabilities. We anticipate that this software tool will expedite materials and molecular design within the scope of the Materials Genome Initiative, particularly benefiting experimentalists.

Abstract Molecular catalysts represent an exceptional class of materials in the realm of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR), offering distinct advantages owing to their adaptable structure, which enables precise control of electronic configurations and outstanding performance in CO 2 RR. This study introduces an innovative approach to heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 RR in an aqueous environment, utilizing a newly synthesized N4‐macrocyclic cobalt complex generated through a dimerization coupling reaction. By incorporating the quaterpyridine moiety, this cobalt complex exhibits the capability to catalyze CO 2 RR at low overpotentials and reaches near‐unity CO production across a wide potential range, as verified by the online mass spectrometry and in situ attenuated total reflectance‐Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Comprehensive computational models demonstrate the superiority of utilizing quarterpyridine moiety in mediating CO 2 conversion compared to the counterpart. This work not only propels the field of electrochemical CO 2 RR but also underscores the promising potential of cobalt complexes featuring quaterpyridine moieties in advancing sustainable CO 2 conversion technologies within aqueous environments.

Abstract The study of Pt clusters and nanoparticles is a prominent area of research due to their ex- tensive range of potential technological applications, particularly in the field of catalysis. The electronic properties of Pt clusters that result in optimal catalytic performance at the nanoscale are significantly influenced by their size and structure. In this report, we sought to evaluate the lowest-energy candidates for Pt18−20 species via Density Functional Theory, identifying more favorable conformers than those previously documented in the literature. New low-symmetry conformers for the Pt19 and Pt20 systems were identified, which are 3.0 and 1.0 kcal/mol more stable, respectively, than previously reported structures (Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys., 2008, 77, 205418). Furthermore, we examined the impact of diverse DFT ap- proximations, including GGA (PBE), meta-GGA (TPSS, M06-L), hybrid (PBE0 and PBEh), meta-GGA hybrid (TPSSh), and range-separated hybrid (ωB97x) functionals. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the employed basis sets in determining the relative energies and structures of the investigated clusters. Our findings indicate that a correct energy ordering for the different isomers examined can only be achieved by employing density functional approximations that incorporate moderate levels of exact Hartree-Fock exchange, in conjunction with the utilization of basis sets of at least quadruple-zeta quality. The resulting structures are asymmetric, with different active sites as evidenced by the analysis of the sigma holes on the electrostatic potential surface. This observation suggests a potential correlation between the electronic structure and the catalytic properties of these Pt clusters, which merits further investigation. We expect that this work will prove to be a valuable reference point for future electronic structure reports dealing with the precise ordering of structures in the determination of global minima of metallic clusters.

Platinum exhibits desirable catalytic properties, but it is scarce and expensive. Optimizing its use in key applications such as emission control catalysis is important to reduce our reliance on such a rare element. Supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) used in emission control systems deactivate over time because of particle growth in sintering processes. In this work, we shed light on the stability against sintering of Pt NPs supported on and encapsulated in Al

Abstract Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are an important enabler of the nascent hydrogen economy. However, due to the reliance on precious metal catalysts like platinum, reducing the cost and broad penetration of PEMFCs beyond vehicle application remains a challenge. In this respect, alternative non‐precious metal catalysts and other carbon‐based catalysts remain the holy grail toward advanced low‐cost PEMFC. This review summarizes recent progress along the development of non‐precious catalysts and their performance under PEMFC operation. Critical factors such as the activity, stability, and durability of non‐precious metal catalysts and their associated mechanisms including the paths leading to degradation are discussed. Ultimately, the review concludes by highlighting the impressive activity and potential of NPM catalysts and the areas of focus to enable the translation of non‐precious catalysts to commercially viable PEMFC systems.

Abstract The field of quantum computing (QC) is expanding, with efforts being made to apply it to areas previously covered by classical algorithms and methods. Bioinformatics is one such domain that is developing in terms of QC. This article offers a broad mapping review of methods and algorithms of QC in bioinformatics, marking the first of its kind. It presents an overview of the domain and aids researchers in identifying further research directions in the early stages of this field of knowledge. The work presented here shows the current state-of-the-art solutions, focuses on general future directions, and highlights the limitations of current methods. The gathered data includes a comprehensive list of identified methods along with descriptions, classifications, and elaborations of their advantages and disadvantages. Results are presented not just in a descriptive table but also in an aggregated and visual format.

Atomic-scale simulations have progressed tremendously over the past decade, largely thanks to the availability of machine-learning interatomic potentials. These potentials combine the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with the ability to reach extensive length and time scales. The i-PI package facilitates integrating the latest developments in this field with advanced modeling techniques thanks to a modular software architecture based on inter-process communication through a socket interface. The choice of Python for implementation facilitates rapid prototyping but can add computational overhead. In this new release, we carefully benchmarked and optimized i-PI for several common simulation scenarios, making such overhead negligible when i-PI is used to model systems up to tens of thousands of atoms using widely adopted machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Behler–Parinello, DeePMD, and MACE neural networks. We also present the implementation of several new features, including an efficient algorithm to model bosonic and fermionic exchange, a framework for uncertainty quantification to be used in conjunction with machine-learning potentials, a communication infrastructure that allows for deeper integration with electronic-driven simulations, and an approach to simulate coupled photon-nuclear dynamics in optical or plasmonic cavities.

Atomistic simulations often rely on interatomic potentials to access greater time and length scales than those accessible to first-principles methods, such as density functional theory. However, since a parameterized potential typically cannot reproduce the true potential energy surface of a given system, we should expect a decrease in accuracy and increase in error in quantities of interest calculated from these simulations. Quantifying the uncertainty on the outputs of atomistic simulations is thus an important, necessary step so that there is confidence in the results and available metrics to explore improvements in said simulations. Here, we address this research question by forming ensembles of atomic cluster expansion potentials, and using conformal prediction with ab initio training data to provide meaningful, calibrated error bars on several quantities of interest for silicon: the bulk modulus, elastic constants, relaxed vacancy formation energy, and the vacancy migration barrier. We evaluate the effects on uncertainty bounds using a range of different potentials and training sets.

We consider the electron stimulated desorption, via dissociative electron attachment, of anionic species from thin condensed CD4 films deposited on a Pt substrate and compare experimentally observed desorption yields with density functional theory calculations of the binding energies of various anionic and neutral moieties to Pt(111). Certain species (which can be considered chemisorbed) exhibit very high binding energies and large charge transfer with the substrate. Other “physisorbed” species have much lower binding energies. Species that chemisorb have lower desorption yields than those that physisorb, especially at 1–2 monolayer coverage of the Pt substrate. The binding energy of D− to Pt is the weakest, and experimentally, the desorption yield is the highest regardless of the thickness of CD4. The calculations show that the formation and desorption of anionic species at a distance of 16 Å from the substrate, which is equivalent to the thickness of CD4 films of four monolayers, are not influenced by the short-range interactions between the substrate and the molecule and DEA products.
