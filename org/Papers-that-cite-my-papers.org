Atomically dispersed metal atoms within graphitic carbon have shown great potential in enhancing the performance of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), though the fundamental principles to guide their rational design remain to be fully established. Here, we report a combined computational and experimental study demonstrating that a group of metals (Ti, V, Mo, and Nb) incorporated into graphitic carbon have promising catalytic properties due to three factors: strong binding with lithium sulfides, reduced redox overpotentials, and low kinetic barriers for Li–S bond activation. In contrast, metals such as Fe and Mn show moderate catalytic behavior, while Ni representing a third group of elements has worse performance. To validate these computational predictions, we synthesized and studied three representative metal elements─Nb, Fe, and Ni─each exhibiting distinct capabilities in binding LiPSs/Li2S and catalyzing polysulfide conversion with varying overpotentials and kinetic barriers. Among them, Nb delivered the most exceptional performance, including superior rate capability (679.3 mA h g–1 at 5 C), high capacity retention (837.5 mA h g–1), and a low capacity decay rate (0.023% per cycle) after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work demonstrates an effective strategy that combines theoretical screening and experimental validation in exploring atomically dispersed metal catalysts for LSBs.

The widespread deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is hindered by the instability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts under acidic conditions, stemming from coupled degradation mechanisms: lattice oxygen overoxidation (driven by high metal-oxygen (M-O) covalency) and acid-induced metal leaching/collapse. Here, we introduce an electronegativity-guided Li- and Ru-doped spinel Co3O4 (LRCO) catalyst featuring mixed Li-O (ionic) and Ru/Co-O (covalent) bonding. This design simultaneously stabilizes lattice oxygen via strong Li-O anchoring and modulates metal valence states through Ru-O-Co electron sharing, preventing overoxidation. Operando studies reveal a potential-dependent mechanism where Ru donates electrons to Co at low potentials, forming active Ru species, and electron redistribution prevents Ru overoxidation at high potentials. Crucially, Li-O bonds effectively suppress oxygen vacancy formation throughout, and Ru-O coordination remains stable, even at high potentials. LRCO achieves a record-low overpotential of 141 mV at 10 mA cm-2 with >3,300 h stability. Integrated PEM electrolyzers operated >720 h at 1 A cm-2, achieving a key milestone toward next-decade industry targets.

Syngas electrosynthesis stands as an energy-saving strategy for producing chemical raw materials, but it remains a great challenge in achieving a balance between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, a series of single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) were constructed by uniformly dispersing different polyoxometalates (POMs) into ZnAl-layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH) through a simple stripping self-assembly technique, forming single-sandwich-layer-based ZnAl-POM (POM = W10, PW12, and P2W18) with abundant oxygen vacancies and zinc vacancies. The well-defined monodispersed W10 clusters function as electron sponges for reversibly accepting and releasing electrons to boost the level of CO2 reduction. The ZnAl-W10-3 can efficiently adjust HER and CO2RR to achieve a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.9% for both H2 and CO production. A broad CO/H2 ratio (0.32-1.35) can be obtained over the optimized ZnAl-W10-3 within a wide potential window (-0.8 to -2.0 V vs RHE) via adjusting the W10 amount. Systematic investigations reveal that W10-mediated electron and proton transfer processes and abundant unsaturated sites in ultrathin ZnAl-LDH significantly enhance the tunability of the CO2RR and HER activities.

Abstract The realization of a hydrogen (H 2 ) economy confronts formidable challenges in storage, transportation, and logistics. To address these challenges, H 2 carriers have been proposed as alternative solutions. Ammonia (NH 3 ), as one of the most promising H 2 carriers, becomes a game‐changer, offering higher volumetric H 2 density than compressed H 2 , simplified logistics, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, which thereby reduces costs and supply chain complexities. However, fully realizing NH 3 ’s potential requires overcoming downstream inefficiencies associated with its conversion either back into H 2 or into energy. Downstream processes primarily include thermal cracking, NH 3 electrolysis, and direct NH 3 fuel cells, two of which are electrochemical systems leveraging the NH 3 oxidation reaction (AOR). The efficiency of these electrochemical systems is significantly limited by severe surface poisoning and poor AOR catalytic activity, underscoring the urgent need for advanced catalyst design. Here, a comprehensive review of AOR electrocatalysis is provided, with a focus on mechanistic insights into activity‐governing steps and surface poisoning pathways. Recent advances in catalyst design are summarized, and overlooked factors are highlighted for performance enhancement. Finally, perspectives on future research directions are presented for AOR catalyst development to accelerate the integration of NH 3 ‐based technologies into the hydrogen economy.

Abstract Although molecular cocatalysts (MCs) have demonstrated significant application potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, the immobilization and stabilization of them for long‐term application remains challenging. Herein, an integrated photoanode (BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 ) is developed by immobilizing Co 4 O 4 cubanes onto NH 2 ‐MIL‐88B(Fe) (NM88B(Fe)) decorated BiVO 4 via site‐isolation strategy. The unoccupied coordination sites in NM88B(Fe) covalently bound to both Co 4 O 4 and BiVO 4 , which significantly decreases the interfacial charge transfer resistance of BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 and achieve prolonged stability. More importantly, the oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 remarkably lowered the energy barrier and thermodynamically favored surface water oxidation. Consequently, the photocurrent density of BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 photoanode achieved up to 5.26 mA·cm −2 at 1.23 V RHE , which is 3.73 times higher than that of bare BiVO 4 . This work presents a site‐isolation strategy to overcome molecular catalyst stabilization challenges in PEC systems while offering crucial insights into designing efficient charge transfer channels between OECs and semiconductors for enhanced water splitting performance.

Abstract Rational design of high‐entropy intermetallic compounds (HEICs) remains challenging due to complex structure‐property relationships and the lack of predictive tools. Here, a data‐driven framework is presented to evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of L1 2 ‐type quinary Pt 3 M(4) HEICs, where M comprises any four elements from six 3 d transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn). Guided by the Pm‐3m space group, 15 distinct compositions with numerous microstates are designed. A deep neural network, trained on 453 computed datasets, predicts hydrogen adsorption energy (∆ E H* ) across 20 000 microstructures per composition, enabling statistical mapping of site‐specific performance. To capture the effect of local atomic environments, a novel statistical evaluation approach is introduced that quantifies the number of microstates falling within the optimal ∆ E H* range, advancing beyond conventional mean‐based evaluations. Among all candidates, Pt 3 (CrMnFeCo) emerges as the most promising HER catalyst, validated experimentally over a wide pH range. Further in‐depth data mining reveals that surface Co, Cr, and Fe optimize Pt‐Pt‐M sites, while subsurface Ni and Co modulate Pt‐Pt‐Pt interactions. This study establishes a new paradigm for HEIC catalyst design and deepens the mechanistic understanding of activity origin in complex multimetal systems.

With the growing demand for realistic representations of chemical structures and the advent of exascale computing, the intelligent sampling of potential energy surfaces and efficient identification of global minima have become more essential but also more feasible. Building on prior studies demonstrating the efficiency of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) swarm intelligence algorithm, we report a hybrid metaheuristic framework that integrates the adaptive exploration capabilities of ABC coupled with the exploitation strengths of genetic algorithms (GA) in a scalable, Python-based implementation. The resulting tool, RANGE (Robust Adaptive Nature-inspired Global Explorer), provides seamless interfaces to multiple potential energy evaluators, either directly or via widely used Python libraries, and is designed for high-performance computing environments. We describe the implementation details of RANGE and evaluate its performance, relative to ABC- or GA-alone based algorithms, on a variety of chemical systems, including molecular clusters and heterogeneous surfaces. Our results demonstrate RANGE’s efficiency, robustness, and broad applicability in addressing challenging global optimization problems in computational chemistry and materials science.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor-phase thin-film deposition technique offering precise atomic-scale control over film thickness and conformality. Widely used across diverse fields including microelectronics, energy storage, and biomaterials, traditional optimization of ALD processes typically relies on trial-and-error experimentation or computational simulations. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods have emerged as powerful tools to significantly accelerate and improve ALD process optimization, material discovery, and fundamental understanding of ALD chemistry. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in the intersection of ALD and AI/ML, examining their roles in process optimization, new material development, reaction mechanism exploration, and the application of advanced algorithms, including large language models. Additionally, we introduce a bibliometric approach to systematically collect and analyze relevant scientific literature. Finally, we outline existing challenges and provide insights into the future potential of integrating AI with ALD to drive further innovation in materials science and engineering.

Catalysts operate under complex conditions that require sophisticated approaches to understand their dynamics. This perspective outlines advances in experimental operando techniques, theoretical approaches, and machine learning (ML)-based data analysis to elucidate catalyst dynamics and improve the next-generation catalyst design. We first survey operando techniques, spanning electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, and vibrational spectroscopy, that capture catalyst dynamics under operating conditions. We then discuss how operando observations integrate with and inform theoretical models, creating an iterative feedback loop between experiment and computation. Finally, we highlight how advanced data analysis, especially ML, enables the interpretation of high-dimensional operando data sets and can even inform catalyst design. Together, these synergetic approaches provide a unified framework for probing catalyst function and accelerating the rational design of efficient, durable catalytic systems for sustainable chemical manufacturing.

The development of proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technologies urgently demands electrocatalytic systems capable of maintaining exceptional activity and durability under harsh acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. Here, we present ultralow Ru loading on cobalt–manganese oxides (Ru–Co2MnO4.5) through a facile synthetic strategy. Ru and Co sites facilitate the direct coupling of the oxygen radicals, thereby exceeding the limitations of the scaling relation and triggering the oxide pathway mechanism. Structural characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Ru single atoms suppresses both lattice oxygen and metal dissolution while maintaining good coordination environments and crystal structures. Furthermore, Ru single-atom loading enhances the hydroxyl adsorption on the catalyst surface and promotes the OER kinetics. Consequently, the Ru–Co2MnO4.5 catalyst achieves an optimal trade-off between catalytic efficiency and structural durability. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the Ru–Co2MnO4.5 demonstrates a minimal overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and exhibits excellent stability during 600 h. In the PEMWE device, the Ru–Co2MnO4.5 catalyst requires merely a voltage of 1.638 V to achieve 1 A cm–2, with an ultralow Ru loading of 20 μg cm–2. The system can operate for over 100 h under a high current density of 1 A cm–2, showcasing its potential in a practical hydrogen production device. This work presents an innovative strategy for advancing the development of high-efficiency and large-scale green hydrogen production systems while elucidating the underlying reaction mechanisms.

Fouling and corrosion are critical challenges in heat transfer equipment. This study developed nickel-tungsten (Ni-W) composite coatings reinforced with micro- and nano-graphene (Gr) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (Ni-W/Gr and Ni-W/GrPTFE) to enhance resistance to fouling and corrosion. The Ni-W/GrPTFE superhydrophobic coating exhibited a significantly greater water contact angle (152.1°) compared to bare Q235 carbon steel (90.1°) and a notably lower surface free energy of 3.48 mJ/m2, compared to 31.36 mJ/m2 for bare Q235 carbon steel. Surface roughness, chemical composition, and micromorphology were analyzed using atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results revealed superior corrosion resistance for the Ni-W/GrPTFE coating, with a minimal corrosion current density of 2.25 × 10−5 µA/cm2, a higher impedance modulus of 8.8 × 104 Ω·cm2 at low frequencies, and substantial charge transfer resistance of 5.49 × 104 Ω·cm2. Tafel polarization further confirmed a lower corrosion rate of 2.12x10−3 mm/a. Furthermore, fouling tests at various temperatures showed that the Ni-W/GrPTFE coating achieved a 90.74% fouling inhibition rate. Additionally, self-cleaning tests confirmed the absence of surface contaminants. These results indicate that the Ni-W/GrPTFE composite superhydrophobic coating offers exceptional durability, making it a promising solution for harsh conditions in heat transfer systems, geothermal applications, and chemical industries.

Abstract Gasophilic/hydrophobic microstructured Cu nanomaterials address the multi‐carbon (C 2+ ) selectivity bottleneck in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), yet their morphological control is hindered by low reduction potentials and high surface atomic mobility. This study reports a bioinspired gas‐trapping hydrophobic Cu nanostructure (BGH‐Cu) via in situ electrochemical reconstruction, forming an interconnected cavity network that confers gasophilic/hydrophobic properties. Mechanistic studies reveal cavities act as dynamic electrolyte reservoirs, selectively retaining OH − /K + to suppress proton transport and create a local micro‐alkaline environment, while cavity‐enhanced cation enrichment synergizes with C─C coupling. BGH‐Cu achieves C 2 H 4 Faradaic efficiency of 54.7% at current density of 600 mA cm −2 in strongly acidic conditions (pH 1), with 63.7% single‐pass carbon efficiency and 40 h stability in a membrane electrode assembly configuration. This work provides a non‐extreme synthesis strategy for gasophilic/hydrophobic Cu nanomaterials, elucidates the “cavity microenvironment modulation” mechanism for C 2+ selectivity, and offers a new paradigm for high‐current‐density acidic CO 2 RR to C 2+ products.

In this work, we introduce TorchANI 2.0, a significantly improved version of the free and open source TorchANI software package for training and evaluation of ANI (ANAKIN-ME) deep learning models. TorchANI 2.0 builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, while addressing its limitations and introducing new features. These changes greatly enhance its extensibility, performance, and suitability as a framework for developing models ready for molecular dynamics applications. These improvements include the introduction of a modular system to add arbitrary pairwise potentials to models, CUDA-accelerated optimization for faster and more memory-efficient calculation of local atomic features, and a batched system for better performance of network ensembles, among others. Our benchmarks demonstrate that TorchANI 2.0 achieves significant speedup over previous versions in both training and inference, and the library enhancements allow users to train physically constrained models that better represent important qualities of chemical systems. We demonstrate this by introducing three new ANI models that incorporate these features and evaluating their capabilities.

Seventeen-carbon-atom-wide armchair graphene nanoribbons (17-AGNRs) are promising candidates for high-performance electronic devices due to their narrow electronic bandgap. Atomic precision in edge structure and width control is achieved through a bottom-up on-surface synthesis (OSS) approach from tailored molecular precursors in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). This synthetic protocol must be optimized to meet the structural requirements for device integration, with the ribbon length being the most critical parameter. Here, we report optimized OSS conditions that produce 17-AGNRs with an average length of ∼17 nm. This length enhancement is achieved through a gradual temperature ramping during an extended annealing period, combined with a template-like effect driven by monomer assembly at high surface coverage. The resulting 17-AGNRs are comprehensively characterized in UHV by using scanning probe techniques and Raman spectroscopy. Raman measurements following substrate transfer enabled the characterization of GNRs' length distribution on the device substrate and confirmed their stability under ambient conditions and harsh chemical environments, including acid vapors and etchants. The increased length and ambient stability of the 17-AGNRs led to their reliable integration into device architectures. As a proof of concept, we integrate 17-AGNRs into field-effect transistors (FETs) with graphene electrodes and confirm that electronic transport occurs through the GNRs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating narrow bandgap GNRs into functional devices and contributes to advancing the development of carbon-based nanoelectronics.

Abstract Efficient and sustainable hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) requires the development of robust low‐cost oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. A robust acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is fabricated, featuring single Co atoms incorporated into commercial RuO 2 (Co SA /RuO 2 ) and demonstrate that the Co sites suppress the mobility of lattice oxygen in commercial RuO 2 , thereby eliminating the stability‐limited lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism and improving the catalyst stability. The theoretical calculations reveal that the atomically dispersed Co sites shifts the εd‐dn of RuO 2 downward, optimizing the adsorption of O * and * OOH, thereby changing the rate‐determining step and improving the catalytic performance. In addition, atomically dispersed Co enhances the strength of the Ru–O lattice interaction, thereby alleviating the dissolution of Ru and effectively improving the stability of the catalyst under OER conditions. Specifically, the Co SA /RuO 2 ‐promoted PEMWE requires a voltage of 1.662 V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm −2 and can be stably performed for >550 h at 200 mA cm −2 with negligible performance decay. Thus, this work paves the way for the fabrication of highly active and stable ruthenium oxide–based OER catalysts and their use as alternatives to the costly Ir‐based counterparts.

Developing low-cost, high-performance metal-free oxygen reduction catalysts demands precise quantification of structure-performance relationships in nitrogen-doped carbons. Structural search algorithms combined with density functional theory (DFT) enable comprehensive analysis of catalytic performance versus structural features. Using nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) as models, we computationally resolve how nitrogen species types (pyridinic-N, graphitic-N) and substitution positions influence the stability and intrinsic activity. Boltzmann statistics quantify the contributions of all configurations to the current density during oxygen reduction. Furthermore, we identify dominant configurations grouping NGQDs into configuration lumps. Thermodynamically, nitrogen atoms preferentially occupy carbon atoms at defect-adjacent sites as pyridinic-N. Their spatial distribution controls local atomic charge redistribution and adsorption environments, thereby modulating intrinsic activity. These materials exhibit extreme configuration sensitivity: thermodynamically stable dominant configurations may contribute minimally to current density. Crucially, lumped pyridinic-N configurations dominate ORR performance. This work provides theoretical insights supporting carbon adjacent to pyridinic-N as the primary active site in N-doped carbon ORR catalysts. It establishes a universal framework for analyzing structure–activity relationships in nonmodel catalytic systems.

Comprehensive Summary Developing high‐performance, durable, and cost‐effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is essential for advancing next‐generation energy devices like zinc‐air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we engineer a hybrid Fe‐N‐C catalyst (FeSA‐Fe NP /CeO 2 @NC) integrating atomically dispersed Fe‐N x sites, Fe nanoparticles, and oxygen vacancy‐rich CeO 2 nanoparticles within a nitrogen‐doped carbon matrix. Interfacial charge transfer and oxygen vacancy‐mediated electron redistribution, synergistically enhanced by strong metal‐support interactions (SMSI), optimize the electronic configuration of Fe‐N x sites and reduce their electron density. The resulting catalyst exhibits exceptional ORR activity and stability, featuring a half‐wave potential of 0.925 V (vs. RHE) in alkaline media and minimal degradation (1% and 2.8% negative shifts after 10,000/20,000 cycles). In ZABs, it achieves a peak power density of 310.29 mW·cm –2 while sustaining stable operation for over 600 h. This work demonstrates dual role of CeO 2 in enhancing activity and stability, establishing a design principle for high‐performance electrocatalysts in energy conversion systems.

Seamless management of atomistic data sets is a critical prerequisite for the successful development and deployment of machine learning potentials (MLPs). Here, we present dpdata, an open-source Python library designed to streamline every aspect of MLP data handling. Built upon a flexible, plugin-based architecture, dpdata supports reading, writing, and converting between a broad range of file formats─from popular quantum-chemistry packages and molecular-dynamics engines to specialized MLP frameworks. Users may define custom data types, formats, drivers, and minimizers, enabling effortless extension to emerging software. Key utilities include automated train-test splitting, coordinate perturbation for active learning, outlier-energy removal, Δ-learning data set generation, error-metric computation, and unit conversion. Through efficient NumPy-backed storage and system-level operations, dpdata achieves significant memory saving and inference speedups over configuration-by-configuration tools such as ASE. We also highlight practical impact, with dpdata used across published studies, for format conversion, data storage, coordinate perturbation, and utilization in other projects for data processing.

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion (ECC) offers a promising route to reduce CO 2 emissions and to store renewable electricity in the form of chemical fuels. To date, ECC has been mainly based on pure CO 2 gas isolated from carbon capture solutions, which is an energy‐intensive step. Recently, direct CO 2 conversion from a capture solution, which enables integrated CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion, has attracted attention because it can eliminate the energy‐intensive CO 2 isolation step. In addition, producing concentrated gas products in integrated systems reduces the cost for downstream separation. This review discusses the key aspects of integrated CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion systems, including direct air capture (DAC), the chemistry of CO 2 capture and release, electrode designs and system configurations, as well as technoeconomic viability. First, the fundamental concepts and chemistry of CO 2 capture and in situ CO 2 release in electrochemical reactors are summarized. Then, recent advancements in integrated systems are discussed, covering both system configurations and electrode designs. Potential avenues for enhancing product selectivity toward high‐value chemicals, such as ethylene and ethanol, as well as lowering operating cell voltages and improving the economic viability of integrated systems, are highlighted. Finally, major technical and economic challenges as well as emerging research opportunities in the domain of integrated CO 2 capture and conversion are highlighted.

Machine learning models are increasingly used to predict material properties and accelerate atomistic simulations, but the reliability of their predictions depends on the representativeness of the training data. We present a scalable, GPU-accelerated uncertainty quantification framework based on k-nearest-neighbor kernel density estimation (KDE) in a PCA-reduced descriptor space. This method efficiently detects sparsely sampled regions in large, high-dimensional data sets and provides a transferable, model-agnostic uncertainty metric without requiring retraining costly model ensembles. The framework is validated across diverse case studies varying in (i) chemistry, (ii) prediction models (including foundational neural network), (iii) descriptors used for KDE estimation, and (iv) properties whose uncertainty is sought. In all cases, the KDE-based score reliably flags extrapolative configurations, correlates well with conventional ensemble-based uncertainties, and highlights regions of reduced prediction trustworthiness. The approach offers a practical route for improving the interpretability, robustness, and deployment readiness of ML models in materials science.
