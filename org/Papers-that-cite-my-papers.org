The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Among different metal elements, gold (Au) stands out due to its high electronegativity and remarkable catalytic properties, especially when it is in nanoscale size. In this review, we aim to comprehensively analyze the oxygen electrocatalytic performance of nanosized Au, including the influence of the crystal surface, morphology, substrate materials of Au nanoparticles, size and ligands of Au nanoclusters, and Au single atoms on oxygen electrocatalysis. By exploring the catalytic performance of noble metals, non-noble metals, oxides, hydroxides/oxyhydroxides/layered double hydroxides, sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, and selenides through the integration of nanosized Au, which offers valuable insights for enhancing the OER efficiency. These effects can be attributed to two mechanisms: i) adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and ii) lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM), where the nanosized Au changed the electronic structure of the catalysts and improved the adsorption of reaction intermediates to accelerate electron transfer process or exerts the synergistic effect between metallic Au and oxygen vacancies. For instance, Gold-driven OER catalysts can be widely used in zinc-air batteries and water splitting in the future.

The oxidation rate of NO to NO2 is a critical parameter in the removal of NOx within selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. LaCoO3-δ is a kind of potential catalyst to enhance the oxidation of NO to NO2, it may offers an economic and stable alternative to noble metal catalysts, particularly at elevated temperatures. This study aimed to enhance the catalytic efficiency of LaCoO3-δ through strontium (Sr) doping. La1-xSrxCoO3-δ (with varying x values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) was synthesized using a sol-gel method. La1-xSrxCoO3-δ exhibited superior NO oxidation catalytic activity compared to LaCoO3-δ, with the most notable enhancement observed at x = 0.3 (84% conversion). This improvement can be attributed to the substitution of La3+ with Sr2+, which induces lattice distortion and charge imbalance, thereby creating more oxygen vacancies that enhance the catalytic oxidation capability of La1-xSrxCoO3-δ. However, it's important to note that an excessive amount of Sr can result in the formation of SrCO3 deposits on the surface of La1-xSrxCoO3-δ, thereby diminishing its catalytic oxidation performance. The catalytic oxidation reaction behavior adhered most closely to the O2-adsorbed E-R model, the surface defects in La1-xSrxCoO3-δ playing a pivotal role in the catalytic reaction.

Single atom alloys (SAAs) often bring new chemistry in heterogeneous catalysis and well-defined structure for the study of structure–activity relationship (SAR). However, the existing pressure gap causes the reported SARs quite divergent. Herein, we have studied CO activation over Ni/Cu(100) SAAs in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and millibar range. While the Ni SAAs formed on Cu(100) significantly enhance the CO adsorption strength under UHV conditions, the CO treatment at elevated pressure leads to notable surface carbon and oxygen deposition through surface reaction. Density functional theory calculations revealed that either dissociation or disproportionation is thermodynamically forbidden for the coverage of CO less than 5/16 ML. However, these two reaction pathways can be opened at higher CO coverages due to the elevated energy state involving repulsion between adsorbed CO. This work uncovers the initial activation process of CO and demonstrates one typical cause for the pressure gap in surface science study as well.

Modern software engineering of electronic structure codes has seen a paradigm shift from monolithic workflows toward object-based modularity. Software objectivity allows for greater flexibility in the application of electronic structure calculations, with particular benefits when integrated with approaches for data-driven analysis. Here, we discuss different approaches to create deep modular interfaces that connect big-data workflows and electronic structure codes and explore the diversity of use cases that they can enable. We present two such interface approaches for the semi-empirical electronic structure package, DFTB+. In one case, DFTB+ is applied as a library and provides data to an external workflow; in another, DFTB+receives data via external bindings and processes the information subsequently within an internal workflow. We provide a general framework to enable data exchange workflows for embedding new machine-learning-based Hamiltonians within DFTB+ or enabling deep integration of DFTB+ in multiscale embedding workflows. These modular interfaces demonstrate opportunities in emergent software and workflows to accelerate scientific discovery by harnessing existing software capabilities.

While linear scaling relationships have made enormous progress in the computational design of new catalysts, the simultaneous enhancement or weakening of adsorbates for a specific reaction leads to an activity-selectivity trade-off. Focusing on the important industrial reaction, propane dehydrogenation, strategies to break linear scaling relationships have been established to maintain activity with increased selectivity. Nonetheless, elucidating the essential reason for generating the trade-off in propane dehydrogenation from electronic and geometric aspects is still elusive. Moreover, it remains uncertain whether the modified catalyst is restricted by another trade-off. This work begins by examining the effect of electronic regulation on the activity-selectivity trade-off and reveals that either too weak or too strong Pt–C repulsion is the essence of this trade-off. When geometric modulation is introduced, the alloy exhibiting similar Pt–C repulsion to Pt maintains catalytic activity with remarkably improved selectivity. However, despite establishing a better scaling relationship through geometric modulation, the activity-selectivity trade-off still exists with Pt–C repulsion as its essence.

The electrochemical ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) plays a crucial role in electrochemical hydrogen production and direct ethanol fuel cells, both vital for utilizing renewable energies. Ni-based catalysts are pivotal in enabling efficient EOR, leading to the formation of acetic acid/acetaldehyde or CO2. These can serve as alternative anodic oxidation reactions for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis or the anodic reaction for direct ethanol fuel cells, respectively. This review explores recent advancements in EOR over Ni-based catalysts. It begins with an overview of EOR performance across various Ni-based catalysts, followed by an examination of the reaction chemistry, mechanism, and active sites. The review then delves into strategies for designing highly active Ni-based EOR catalysts. These strategies include promotion with transition metals, noble metals, nonmetals, and carbon materials, as well as creating amorphous structures, special morphologies, and single-atom catalysts. Additionally, it discusses the concept of self-supporting catalysts using three-dimensional porous substrates. Finally, the review highlights emerging methodologies that warrant further exploration, along with future directions for designing highly active and stable EOR catalysts.

The electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3–) ions to ammonia (NH3) provides an alternative method to eliminate harmful NO3– pollutants in water as well as to produce highly valuable NH3 chemicals. The NH3 yield rate however is still limited to the μmol h–1 cm–2 range when dealing with dilute NO3– concentrations found in waste streams. Copper (Cu) has attracted much attention because of its unique ability to effectively convert NO3– to NH3. We have reported a simple and scalable electrochemical method to produce a Cu foil having its surface covered with a porous Cu nanostructure enriched with (100) facets, which efficiently catalyzes NO3– to NH3. The Cu(100)-rich electrocatalyst showed a very high NH3 production rate of 1.1 mmol h–1 cm–2 in NO3– concentration as low as 14 mM NO3–, which is 4–5 times higher than the best-reported values. Increasing the NO3– concentration (140 mM) resulted in an NH3 production yield rate of 3.34 mmol h–1 cm–2. The durability test conducted for this catalyst foil in a flow cell system showed greater than 100 h stability with a Faradaic efficiency greater than 98%, demonstrating its potential to be used on an industrially relevant scale. Further, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to understand the better catalytic activity of Cu(100) compared to Cu(111) facets toward NO3–RR.

Here, the study highlights an e g electron‐filling state in octahedral TM‐catalysts, achieved by the modulation of splitting energy (Δ) via different anions (R) (Cl − , PO 4 3− , NO 3 − , F − , SO 4 2− , CO 3 2− ). The e g ‐ electron filling state customization predominantly arises from the adjustment of Co‐ d z 2 orbital energy, which can tailor the bandgap between Co‐ d z 2 and O‐ p orbits (Δε d‐p ), thus customizing lattice‐oxygen (O L ) activities and the OER mechanism. Combining the experimental measurements with DFT calculations, it is concluded that increased e g electron in TM‐catalysts brings decreased Δε d‐p , which can manageably strengthen lattice‐oxygen reactivity. Consequently, the OER mechanism on TM catalyst is transformed from adsorbate precipitation mechanism (AEM) to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) and customized OER pathways with different lattice‐oxygen activities. The screened PO 4 3‐_ TM, with the optimal O L activity in LOM path, possesses excellent activity and stability, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at 236 mV overpotential and maintaining stable operation for 300 h with inapparent degradation at 10 mA cm −2 .

The creation of ordered collective vacancies in experiment proves challenging within a two-dimensional lattice, resulting in a limited understanding of their impact on catalyst performance. Motivated by the successful experimental synthesis of monolayer molybdenum borides with precisely ordered metal vacancies [Zhou et al. Science 2021, 373, 801–805] through dealloying, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in monolayer borides was systematically investigated to elucidate the influence of such ordered metal vacancies on catalytic reactions and the underlying mechanisms. The results reveal that the N-containing intermediates tend to dissociate, facilitating the NRR process with reduced UL. The emergence of ordered metal vacancies modulates the electronic properties of the catalyst and partially facilitates the decomposition of N-containing intermediates. However, the UL for NRR in Mo4/3B2 and W4/3B2 exhibits a significant increase. The compromised electrochemical performance is explained through the development of a simple electronic descriptor of the d–p band center (ΔdM–pB). Among these materials, Mo4/3Sc2/3B2 exhibits the most superior catalytic activity with a UL of −0.5 V and favorable NRR selectivity over the HER. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the role of ordered metal vacancies in transition-metal boride for the NRR and highlight a novel avenue toward the rational design of superior NRR catalysts.

Abstract In response to the climate goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, efficient electrochemical energy conversion devices are garnering increasing attention. However, the enhancement of electrochemical performance using noble metal electrocatalysts, along with cost reduction and electrode fabrication, remain significant challenges. Noble metal hybrid nanostructures, possessing multiple surface functionalities, lead to outstanding electrocatalytic performances and low‐cost potential. Strain effects can bolster the bonding strength between the noble metal layers and the substrate or core layers, while simultaneously affecting electrocatalytic performance through tuning the binding strength between catalytically active sites and reactants, including intermediates. This review encapsulates the research efforts directed towards improving the performance of noble metal electrocatalysts and provides an overview of the latest advancements in controlling the surface state of noble metals by incorporating a secondary component. We discuss systematic approaches to adjusting surface strain effects on noble metals, characterization techniques, and application case studies, while extracting key design indicators for readers to consider from a macroscopic perspective. Further, we outline the challenges encountered and current solutions when advancing noble metal catalysts from theoretical mechanisms to practical use. Finally, the perspectives on the future research of noble metal surface layer control techniques were also provided.

Abstract Atomically dispersed single‐atom catalysts (SACs) on carbon supports show great promise for H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis, but conventional wet chemistry methods using particulate carbon blacks in powder form have limited their potential as two‐electron (2e − ) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Here, we demonstrate high‐performance Co SACs supported on a free‐standing aligned carbon nanofiber (CNF) using electrospinning and arc plasma deposition (APD). Based on the surface oxidation treatment of aligned CNF and precise control of the deposition amount in a dry‐based APD process, we successfully form densely populated Co SACs on aligned CNF. Through experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that Co SAC has a Co–N 2 –O 2 moiety with one epoxy group, leading to excellent 2e − ORR activity. Furthermore, the aligned CNF significantly improves mass transfer in flow cells compared to randomly oriented CNF, showing an overpotential reduction of 30 mV and a 1.3‐fold improvement (84.5%) in Faradaic efficiency, and finally achieves an outstanding production rate of 15.75 mol g cat −1 h −1 at 300 mA cm −2 . The high‐performance Co SAC supported on well‐aligned CNF is also applied in an electro‐Fenton process, demonstrating rapid removal of methylene blue and bisphenol F due to its exceptional 2e − ORR activity.

Abstract In this work, three dimensional (3D) self‐supported Ni‐FeOH@Ni‐FeP needle arrays with core‐shell heterojunction structure are fabricated via in situ hydroxide growth over Ni‐FeP surface. The as‐prepared electrodes show an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, only requiring the low overpotential of 232 mV to reach 200 mA cm −2 with the Tafel slop of 40 mV dec −1 . For overall water splitting, an alkaline electrolyzer with these electrodes only requires a cell voltage of 2.14 V to reach 1 A cm −2 . Mechanistic investigations for such excellent electrocatalytic performances are utilized by in situ Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The computation results present that Ni‐FeOH@Ni‐FeP attains better intrinsic conductivity and the D‐band center (close to that of the ideal catalyst), thus giving superior excellent catalytic performances. Likewise, the surface Ni‐FeOH layer can improve the structural stability of Ni‐FeP cores and attenuate the eventual formation of irreversible FeOOH products. More importantly, the appearance of FeOOH intermediates can effectively decrease the energy barrier of NiOOH intermediates, and then rapidly accelerate the sluggish reaction dynamics, as well as further enhance the electrocatalytic activities, reversibility and cycling stability.

Abstract NiFe‐based hydroxides are well‐established as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline purified water. However, they usually degrade rapidly in seawater electrolysis because of concentrated Cl − anions in seawater. In this work, a facile approach utilizing an ultrafast dipping method is presented to fabricate durable and scalable NiFe hydroxides, enhanced by interfacial akaganéite FeOOH for seawater splitting. This study reveals significantly improved electrocatalytic stability of NiFe hydroxides at an ampere‐level current density of 1000 mA cm −2 for 100 h in alkaline seawater. It is realized by the formed FeOOH in a specific akaganéite phase whose lattice tunnels are well filled by intrinsic Cl − anions, that serve to electrostatically repel corrosive chlorides in electrolyte. This anionic design also provides superior corrosion protection for other active metal‐based OER electrocatalysts when deployed in alkaline purified water and allows for facile scaling up of the anode, facilitating the practical utilization for seawater electrolysis.

Abstract In this work, a highly accurate neural network potential (NNP) is presented, named Pt NNP , and the exploration of the reconstruction of the Pt(001) surface and its vicinal surfaces with it. Contrary to the most accepted understanding of the Pt(001) surface reconstruction, the study reveals that the main driving force behind Pt(001) quasi‐hexagonal reconstruction is not the surface stress relaxation but the increased coordination number of the surface atoms resulting in stronger intralayer binding in the reconstructed surface layer. In agreement with experimental observations, the optimized supercell size of the reconstructed Pt(001) surface contains (5 × 20) unit cells. Surprisingly, the reconstruction of the vicinal Pt(001) surfaces leads to a smooth shell‐like surface layer covering the whole surface and diminishing sharp step edges.

Using reference reduction potentials of quinones recently measured relative to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), we benchmark absolute one-electron reduction potentials computed for 345 Q/Q•– and 265 Q•–/Q2– half-reactions using adiabatic electron affinities computed with density functional theory and solvation energies computed with four continuum solvation models: IEF-PCM, C-PCM, COSMO, and SM12. Regression analyses indicate a strong linear correlation between experimental and absolute computed Q/Q•– reduction potentials with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between 0.95 and 0.96 and the mean absolute error (MAE) relative to the linear fit between 83.29 and 89.51 mV for different solvation methods when the slope of the regression is constrained to 1. The same analysis for Q•–/Q2– gave a linear regression with r between 0.74 and 0.90 and MAE between 95.87 and 144.53 mV, respectively. The y-intercept values obtained from the linear regressions are in good agreement with the range of absolute reduction potentials reported in the literature for the SCE but reveal several sources of systematic error. The y-intercepts from Q•–/Q2– calculations are lower than those from Q/Q•– by around 320–410 mV for IEF-PCM, C-PCM, and SM12 compared to 210 mV for COSMO. Systematic errors also arise between molecules having different ring sizes (benzoquinones, naphthoquinones, and anthraquinones) and different substituents (titratable vs nontitratable). SCF convergence issues were found to be a source of random error that was slightly reduced by directly optimizing the solute structure in the continuum solvent reaction field. While SM12 MAEs were lower than those of the other solvation models for Q/Q•–, SM12 had larger MAEs for Q•–/Q2– pointing to a larger error when describing multiply charged anions in DMF. Altogether, the results highlight the advantages of, and further need for, testing computational methods using a large experimental data set that is not skewed (e.g., having more titratable than nontitratable substituents on different parent groups or vice versa) to help further distinguish between sources of random and systematic errors in the calculations.

Abstract We here introduce the Aquamarine (AQM) dataset, an extensive quantum-mechanical (QM) dataset that contains the structural and electronic information of 59,783 low-and high-energy conformers of 1,653 molecules with a total number of atoms ranging from 2 to 92 (mean: 50.9), and containing up to 54 (mean: 28.2) non-hydrogen atoms. To gain insights into the solvent effects as well as collective dispersion interactions for drug-like molecules, we have performed QM calculations supplemented with a treatment of many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions of structures and properties in the gas phase and implicit water. Thus, AQM contains over 40 global and local physicochemical properties (including ground-state and response properties) per conformer computed at the tightly converged PBE0+MBD level of theory for gas-phase molecules, whereas PBE0+MBD with the modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) model of water was used for solvated molecules. By addressing both molecule-solvent and dispersion interactions, AQM dataset can serve as a challenging benchmark for state-of-the-art machine learning methods for property modeling and de novo generation of large (solvated) molecules with pharmaceutical and biological relevance.

Atomically dispersed iron–nitrogen-carbon (Fe–N4–C) catalysts show great promises for the electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3−) reduction to ammonia (NH3). Nevertheless, the microenvironmental engineering of the single Fe active sites for further optimizing the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Herein, we proposed to regulate the coordination environment of single Fe active sites to boost its intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for NO3− –to–NH3 conversion by the incorporation of new heteroatoms, including B, C, O, Si, P, and S. Our results revealed that most of the candidates possess low formation energies, showing great potential for experimental synthesis. Moreover, incorporating heteroatoms effectively modulates the charge redistribution and the d–band center of single Fe active sites, enabling the regulation of the binding strength of nitrogenous intermediates. As a result, the N and C coordinated Fe active site (Fe–N3C) exhibits superior catalytic performance for NO3− electroreduction with a relatively low limiting potential (–0.13 V) due to its optimal adsorption strength with nitrogenous intermediates induced by its moderate charge and d–band center. Importantly, our experimental measures confirmed such theoretical prediction: a maximum NH3 yield rate of 21.07 mg h−1 mgcat.−1 and 95.74 % Faradaic efficiency were achieved for NO3− electroreduction on Fe–N3C catalyst. These findings not only suggest a highly efficient catalyst for nitrate reduction but also provide insight into how to design and prepare electrocatalysts with enhanced catalytic performance.

Exploring inexpensive electrocatalysts that can efficiently and selectively convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels is important to promote carbon neutrality and solve the energy crisis. Current electrocatalysts, such as Cu-based alloys, single-atom catalysts, and dual-atom catalysts, use the d states of metal in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Inspired by this, this work studies CO2 reduction reaction from another approach. Herein, using first principles study, we systematically investigate the prospect of nonmetal (B, C, O and F) doped monolayers g-GaN as electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction. We found that nonmetal doping can effectively regulate the electron distribution and p-band center of the active center (N site), which can adjust the initial adsorption, activation degree, charge transfer amount of CO2, and promote the formation of intermediates. Interestingly, B and C doped systems have better catalytic activity for CH4, with limiting potentials of −0.61 and −0.53 V, respectively. More importantly, F doped system has higher activity and selectivity for CH3OH production and inhibit competitive HER, with lower limiting potentials of −0.60 V. This study provides a new theoretical basis for the design and screening of electrocatalysts with high activity and product selectivity using nonmetal as the active site.

Supported nonprecious metal catalysts such as copper (Cu) are promising replacements for Pt-based catalysts for a wide range of energy-related electrochemical reactions. Direct electrochemical deposition is one of the most straightforward and versatile methods to synthesize supported nonprecious metal catalysts. However, further advancement in the design of supported nonprecious metal catalysts requires a detailed mechanistic understanding of the interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics of the deposition phenomena under realistic reaction conditions. Here, we study the electrodeposition of Cu on carbon nanotubes and graphene derivatives under electrochemical conditions using

We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of the atomic positions scheme.

High-throughput computational materials discovery has promised significant acceleration of the design and discovery of new materials for many years. Despite a surge in interest and activity, the constraints imposed by large-scale computational resources present a significant bottleneck. Furthermore, examples of very large-scale computational discovery carried out through experimental validation remain scarce, especially for materials with product applicability. Here, we demonstrate how this vision became reality by combining state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models and traditional physics-based models on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) resources to quickly navigate through more than 32 million candidates and predict around half a million potentially stable materials. By focusing on solid-state electrolytes for battery applications, our discovery pipeline further identified 18 promising candidates with new compositions and rediscovered a decade's worth of collective knowledge in the field as a byproduct. We then synthesized and experimentally characterized the structures and conductivities of our top candidates, the Na

Estimating the potential energy of a molecular system at a quantum level of theory is a task of paramount importance in computational chemistry. The often employed density functional theory approach allows one to accomplish this task, yet most often at significant computational costs. This prompted the community to develop so-called machine learning potentials to achieve near-quantum accuracy at molecular mechanics computational cost. In this paper, we introduce OBIWAN, a feed-forward neural network that bears some relevant structural properties that also led to the definition of a new kind of general-purpose neural network layer. Its featurization process scales efficiently with newly added atomic species. This allows one to seamlessly add new atom types without requiring to change the topology of the network. Also, this allows one to train on new data sets leveraging a previously trained OBIWAN, hence converging very quickly. This avoids training from scratch and renders the approach more compliant with a green computing perspective.
