Abstract Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, yet its widespread application remains constrained by the scarcity of annotated training data. While deep generative models offer a promising solution, they typically struggle to reproduce the complex high‐frequency components that define experimental STEM images. Here, STEMDiff, a conditional diffusion model that transforms simple binary labels derived from crystal structures into realistic STEM images through a physical information embedding strategy, is proposed. By developing a novel Discrete Wavelet Transform‐based skip‐connection architecture, the high‐frequency bias inherent in diffusion models are addressed, enabling the preservation of experimental noise characteristics. This approach generates images that are quantitatively nearly indistinguishable from experimental data (17 fold improvement over previous methods) while retaining ground truth structural information. Fully convolutional networks trained exclusively on these synthetic images achieve high‐precision atomic column detection in experimental STEM images of WSe 2 and graphene, despite the presence of substantial background noise and contamination. This approach effectively eliminates the need for laborious manual annotation, providing a scalable solution to the data bottleneck in STEM image analysis. The principles underlying STEMDiff can extend to other scientific imaging modalities, accelerating advancements in materials design for water treatment.

Abstract Real‐time visualization of alloying evolution is crucial yet challenging for designing and synthesizing face‐centered cubic (fcc) nanoalloy catalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a trimetallic fcc NiFeMo nanoalloy is synthesized via topological reduction of NiFeMo layered double hydroxide (LDH) under an Ar/H 2 atmosphere. In situ heating transmission electron microscopy reveals the transforamtion of non‐hexagonal NiFeMo LDH nanosheets into irregular inverse‐spinel Ni 1‐x Mo x Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles, eventually forming spherical fcc NiFeMo nanoalloy particles. Furthermore, the NiFeMo nanoalloy demonstrates a Faradaic efficiency of 99.3% and superior intrinsic OER activity compared to NiFe and Ni nanoalloys at a consistent mass loading, due to synergistic metal interactions. The NiFeMo nanoalloy‐modified nickel foam electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, with structural and elemental analyses confirming that the original fcc structure remains intact after long‐term OER testing. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry coupled with isotope labelling experiment illustrates that the OER on NiFeMo nanoalloy proceeds via an adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway. Theoretical calculations suggest that Mo species reduce the potential barriers for *OH intermediate formation, thereby enhancing the inherent activity of Ni active sites in the NiFeMo nanoalloy. This work presents a novel approach for developing advanced trimetallic and high‐entropy nanoalloy OER catalysts.

We present a response-augmented machine-learning (ML) approach to the energetics of electrified metal surfaces. We leverage local descriptors to learn the work function as the first-order energy change to introduced bias charges and stabilize this learning through Born effective charges. This permits the efficient extension of ML interatomic potential architectures to include finite bias effects up to second order. Application to OH at Cu(100) rationalizes the experimentally observed pH dependence of the preferred adsorption site in terms of a non-Nernstian charge-induced site switching.

Developing cost-effective and high-performance electrodes is critical for advancing hydrogen (H2) production through electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we present a novel electrode design by integrating a β-MnO2 monolayer onto a conventional Ni(100) substrate (MnO2(110)/Ni(100)). This work uniquely explores the influence of oxygen vacancies (OVs) at distinct sites─Osub-top and bridge sites─on both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our findings reveal that the Osub-top vacancy (OOV-MnO2(110)/Ni(100)) significantly enhances HER activity, achieving a hydrogen Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) of −0.015 eV, which surpasses the performance of noble metals such as Pt/C (−0.082 eV) and Ir (−0.08 eV). Additionally, the cathodic exchange current density (J0,c) of OOV-MnO2(110)/Ni(100) reaches 10–0.774 Acm–2, outperforming Pt/C (10–0.92 Acm–2) and Ir (10–1.44 Acm–2). Electrochemical analysis confirms a cathodic activation overpotential (ηa,c) of 0.141 V at 10 mAcm–2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, achieving a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.91 mmolh–1cm–2 at an applied voltage (Vapp) of 1.60 V. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of site-specific oxygen vacancy effects on bifunctional MnO2-based electrodes, demonstrating superior HER activity while maintaining dual functionality for both cathodic and anodic processes. Our results highlight the potential of engineered oxygen vacancies to develop low-cost, high-efficiency electrodes for sustainable hydrogen production, offering a competitive alternative to precious metal-based catalysts.

One of the primary challenges for halide perovskite technology lies in its instability. Water is a ubiquitous environmental factor known to induce lattice expansion to perovskite. Lattice expansion has been proven beneficial to perovskite solar cell, but little is known about its role in lattice stability. In this work, we expose perovskites with pre-adsorbed water to vacuum and investigate the evolution of their structure. Our results show that vacuum induces water desorption and results in the removal of lattice expansion. This lattice recovery leads to an increasing lattice distortion, ultimately favoring the formation of halogen trimers in the case of hybrid perovskites. We thus find that the lack of lattice expansion facilitates the generation of defects detrimental to hybrid perovskite devices. Here, we report the crucial role of lattice expansion in preventing degradation of hybrid halide perovskites, which is of critical importance in the context of solar cell fabrication. Water adsorption is known to induce lattice expansion to perovskite. This work reveals that the elimination of lattice expansion causes formation of detrimental defects in hybrid perovskite, highlighting its critical role in lattice stability.

Abstract Iron‐nitrogen‐carbon (Fe‐N‐C) materials are promising non‐precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet their long‐term stability remains a critical challenge due to the dissolution of Fe‐based active sites and corrosion of the carbon support. Here, a Fe‐Zr dual‐atom carbon‐based catalyst (Fe,Zr‐NC) via a one‐step solid‐state synthesis method is reported. The introduction of atomically dispersed Zr–N units adjacent to Fe–N 4 centers creates a dual‐metal coordination structure that modulates the local electronic environment of Fe and weakens * OH adsorption, which is the rate‐limiting step in the ORR process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Fe–Zr synergy positions the catalyst near the apex of the ORR activity volcano. Extended experimental EXAFS confirms a Fe–Zr distance of ≈3.30 Å, closely matching the theoretical optimum (≈3.39 Å). As a result, Fe, Zr‐NC achieves a high half‐wave potential (0.891 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with negligible activity loss over 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, outperforming commercial Pt/C. In zinc–air batteries, the catalyst delivers a peak power density of 185.7 mW cm −2 and operates stably for over 453 h. This work highlights the importance of dual‐atom synergy in tuning intermediate binding energies and provides design principles for next‐generation ORR electrocatalysts.

Abstract Ammonia (NH 3 ) is a globally important commodity for energy storage, carbon‐free energy carrier, and fertilizer production, but its synthesis through the Haber‐Bosch process is energy‐intensive and emits significant amounts of CO 2 . Electrochemical reduction of N 2 under ambient conditions is a green and potentially promising approach for NH 3 synthesis, but is limited by a high energy barrier of the first *N 2 protonation step, competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, and lack of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a newly designed electrocatalyst is reported by bridging B 2 N 2 with an Mn single atom in B/N co‐doped carbon (denoted MnB 2 N 2 /C), which exhibits a highly efficient N 2 reduction reaction (N 2 RR) activity with NH 3 Faradaic efficiency (FE NH3 ) of ≈37.15% in the aqueous phase system and good electrocatalytic and material stability. The FE NH3 of the MnB 2 N 2 /C catalyst is ≈2.1 times higher than that of the as‐synthesized MnN 4 /C counterpart under the same conditions. In the gas phase system, this MnB 2 N 2 /C catalyst shows a remarkably high NH 3 production rate (87.54 µg mg cat. −1 h −1 ) and FE NH3 (45.66%). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the high N 2 RR to NH 3 performance arising from the Mn site and the neighboring B site suppresses the parasitic HER on the Mn sites.

To tackle the pressing issue of nitrate (NO3–) pollution in wastewater and simultaneously convert it into ammonia (NH3), Cu nanocluster-modified Rhodium (Rh) single atoms anchored on N-doped carbon were synthesized via pyrolysis of a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) precursor and applied to the electrochemical reduction of nitrate at a low concentration. Structural characterizations (X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) confirmed the coexistence of Rh single atoms and Cu nanoclusters as well as their strong electronic interactions. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Rh sites enhanced *H generation via water dissociation and promoted NO3– adsorption, thereby facilitating *H transfer and subsequent hydrogenation steps. As a result, the optimized Cu97.5Rh2.5/NC catalyst exhibited outstanding NO3–RR performance, with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84.53%, an NH3 yield rate of 1252.22 μg·h–1 mgcat–1 at −1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), an NH3 selectivity of 89.13% at −1.0 V vs RHE, and a NO3– conversion rate of 93.34% at −1.1 V vs RHE. This work presents a rational design for atom-economical catalysts, enabling sustainable NH3 electrosynthesis from nitrate-laden wastewater and reducing effluent NO3––N to meet World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards.

Solar-driven photoelectrochemical conversion of nitrite to ammonia represents a sustainable yet unexplored approach for environmental remediation and resource recovery. Here, we demonstrate that Cu5Pd1 alloy nanoparticles, integrated with vertically grown GaN nanowires on an n+-p Si photocathode (Cu5Pd1/GaN/Si), enable highly efficient and selective nitrite reduction to ammonia. This photoelectrode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 99.7% for NH3, with a yield rate of 162.2 μmol h–1 cm–2 and a nearly 100% selectivity. Additionally, the Cu5Pd1/GaN/Si photoelectrode maintains robust performance in the presence of various anions and can effectively remove ∼98% of nitrite even at low concentrations. Density functional theory calculations, supported by in situ spectroscopic techniques, reveal that Cu–Pd alloying fundamentally alters the nitrite reduction mechanisms. Unlike the *NOH-mediated pathway on Cu and Pd, which can lead to competing N2 formation, the CuPd alloy preferentially stabilizes the *NHO intermediate, making NH3 production thermodynamically preferred and highly selective. These findings highlight that a rational electrocatalyst design can effectively tune reaction pathways to enhance both the efficiency and selectivity of photoelectrocatalytic nitrite upcycling.

Solar-driven photocatalytic water splitting is a process for hydrogen production from a renewable source. The practical implementation of this technology is limited by the low conversion efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light and the insufficient long-term stability of photocatalysts. Here we demonstrate a dye (Eosin Y)-sensitized photocatalyst for efficient hydrogen production. The topological semimetal CoAs3 achieves a hydrogen production rate of 2688 μmol h−1 g−1 (λ ≥ 420 nm) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 15.2% at λ = 500 nm. Efficient photocatalytic activity is attributed to the electronic properties of CoAs3, which facilitate electron transfer at the Eosin Y/CoAs3 interface, determined by transient absorption spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations predict that CoAs3 is a Luttinger semimetal, exhibiting a quadratic band touching point near the Fermi level and an associated topological insulator gap. The carrier mobility of the material facilitates the transfer of injected electrons from the dye to active sites. Herein, we report a topological photocatalyst that exhibits enhanced stability and efficiency for solar hydrogen production. Developing photocatalysts from earth-abundant materials is crucial for sustainable solar hydrogen production, yet challenges in efficiency and stability persist. Here, the authors report that the topological semimetal cobalt triarsenide functions as an active and durable platform for this reaction.

The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. Up to around 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation can remain unused. Of the more than 150,000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. For the analyzed dataset, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as >90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.

Data-hungry machine learning methods have become a new standard to efficiently navigate chemical compound space for molecular and materials design and discovery. Due to the severe scarcity and cost of high-quality experimental or synthetic simulated training data, however, data-acquisition costs can be considerable. Relying on reasonably accurate approximate legacy baseline labels with low computational complexity represents one of the most effective strategies to curb data-needs, e.g. through Δ-, transfer-, or multifidelity learning. A surprisingly effective and data-efficient baseline model is presented in the form of a generic coarse-graining Hammett-inspired product (HIP) Ansatz, generalizing the empirical Hammett equation toward arbitrary systems and properties. Numerical evidence for the applicability of HIP includes solvation free energies of molecules, formation energies of quaternary elpasolite crystals, carbon adsorption energies on heterogeneous catalytic surfaces, HOMO-LUMO gaps of metallorganic complexes, activation energies for SN2 reactions, and catalyst-substrate binding energies in cross-coupling reactions. After calibration on the same training sets, HIP yields an effective baseline for improved Δ-machine learning models with superior data-efficiency when compared to previously introduced specialized domain-specific models.

Electrolyte pH is known to affect catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). But a clear understanding of why ORR rates respond more strongly to pH over certain catalysts than others has not been developed. Here, we propose that pH effects on the ORR result from electric field induced changes in the binding energies of intermediates involved in kinetically relevant elementary steps. For strongly binding metals (Pt, Ir, Ru, and Pd), whose rates are limited by the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step to form *OOH or remove adsorbed OH (*OH), ORR rates are weakly affected by electrolyte pH. This behavior is observed because the binding energies of the reaction intermediates in these steps are minimally affected by electric field strength. The weak pH dependence is most pronounced for Pt, which shows essentially identical rates in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. For weakly binding metals (Au, Ag), whose rates are limited by non-PCET O2 adsorption, ORR rates increase significantly when moving from acidic to alkaline electrolytes. This strong pH dependence results from the stabilization of adsorbed O2 by the increasingly negative electric field present at the catalyst surface under alkaline conditions. We argue that modifying electrolyte pH does not change the rate-determining elementary step for the ORR, but does decrease the apparent activation barrier for O2 adsorption over weakly binding catalysts. These arguments are substantiated by a combination of experimental kinetic studies and atomistic simulations.

Abstract Understanding the phase behavior of mixed-cation halide perovskites is critical for optimizing their structural stability and optoelectronic performance. Here, we map the phase diagram of MA 1− x FA x PbI 3 using a machine-learned interatomic potential in molecular dynamics simulations. We identify a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) at approximately 27% FA content, delineating the transition between out-of-phase and in-phase octahedral tilt patterns. Phonon mode projections reveal that this transition coincides with a mode crossover composition, where the free energy landscapes of the M and R phonon modes become nearly degenerate. This results in nanoscale layered structures with alternating tilt patterns, suggesting minimal interface energy between competing phases. Our results provide a systematic and consistent description of this important system, complementing earlier partial and sometimes conflicting experimental assessments. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that band edge fluctuations peak near the MPB, indicating an enhancement of electron-phonon coupling and dynamic disorder effects. These findings establish a direct link between phonon dynamics, phase behavior, and electronic structure, providing a further composition-driven pathway for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. By demonstrating that phonon overdamping serves as a hallmark of the MPB, our study offers insights into the design principles for stable, high-performance perovskite solar cells.
