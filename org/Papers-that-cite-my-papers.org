In this work, we introduce an automated methodology for the efficient and relatively inexpensive exploration of large high-dimensional chemical spaces, with particular focus on number-of-atoms-conserving processes, such as in mechanochemical reactions. Our approach combines: (1) a physically motivated stochastic global-landscape exploration phase (mechanochemical distortion), which efficiently overcomes entropic barriers, and (2) a local exploration phase in which the previously determined local basins are sampled with molecular dynamics and graph theory. Specifically, this last phase makes use of the (vdW-) transition state search using a chemical dynamical simulations algorithm. Our methodology requires minimal input from the user. As a case study, we have explored the conformational landscape, including transition states and minimum energy paths, of the C60H10 hydrogen-carbon clusters owing to their astrochemical relevance as potential carriers of the aromatic infrared bands. From a single initial seed (geometry), we have obtained a series of 212 mechanochemically relevant conformers, and from just 3 of them, we have obtained a set of >13 000 minima spanning the domain of our interest. The underlying chemical network has been fully characterized and rationalized using statistical analysis tools. Our case study perfectly illustrates the potential of our approach in the automatic generation of chemical databases, in other words, annotated data for the training of data-hungry deep learning models in chemistry.

Abstract Excessive adsorption of oxygen‐containing intermediates during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) on palladium (Pd)‐based materials is a critical factor limiting their catalytic activity. Alloying presents a powerful strategy to overcome this inherent challenge. In this study, the alloying of the low electronegativity lanthanide gadolinium (Gd) with Pd is explored. Pioneering theoretical calculations indicate that Gd, acting as an electron donor, induces charge redistribution between the metals. This process weakens the over‐adsorption of OH* intermediates on the Pd surface and reduces the reaction overpotential. Subsequent experiments yield Pd 3 Gd solid‐solution nano‐alloys supported on conductive carbon black (Pd 3 Gd/C‐600), resulting in a 30 mV enhancement in half‐wave potential and a 4.5 fold increase in mass activity in an alkaline medium compared to Pd/C‐600. Due to its superior performance in ORR, Zn‐air batteries utilizing Pd 3 Gd/C‐600 cathodes demonstrate remarkable peak power density and stability over 330 h. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of rare earth alloys and their catalytic chemistry in ORR.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA, affecting cellular function and disease development. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, analyzes large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions. Over the past two decades, advances in bioinformatics technologies for arrays and sequencing have generated vast amounts of data, leading to the widespread adoption of machine learning methods for analyzing complex biological information for medical problems. This review explores recent advancements in DNA methylation studies that leverage emerging machine learning techniques for more precise, comprehensive, and rapid patient diagnostics based on DNA methylation markers. We present a general workflow for researchers, from clinical research questions to result interpretation and monitoring. Additionally, we showcase successful examples in diagnosing cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and multifactorial diseases. Some of these studies have led to the development of diagnostic platforms that have entered the global healthcare market, highlighting the promising future of this field.

Abstract Ni–N 4 –PAN–NC, consisting of an atomic Ni–N 4 site, mimics the intramolecular electron‐harnessing of natural laccase (LAC) confined in a zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (LAC@ZIF‐8) for anodic electrooxidation of bisphenol‐A (BPA). We have introduced a facile π‐conjugated unit of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)‐resorcinol‐derived N‐doped conjugated ‐C≡N. The atomically dispersed Ni‐single‐atom in Ni–N 4 ‐ PAN–NC exhibits high activity for the paired electrolysis of ORR and the electrooxidation of BPA with an enhanced current density. The single Ni–N 4– PAN–NC electrode effectively withdraws the electrons from electrooxidizing BPA due to a built‐in electric field via incorporation of Ni–N 4 . The paired electrolysis of Ni–N 4– PAN–NC biofuel cells is determined by LSV, EIS, and power‐polarization curve for anodic electrooxidation of BPA. Machine learning molecular dynamics (ML‐MD) simulation depicts non‐covalent interaction (hydrogen bonding) between the O‐hydroxyl of BPA and the N of the Ni–N 4– PAN–NC, suggesting preferential adsorption on the Ni–N 4– PAN–NC surface via weak van der Waals interactions and π–π stacking between the aromatic rings of BPA and the conjugated PAN‐NC. An increased power density with increased concentration of BPA in the absence of ABTS suggests a DET mechanism of BPA electrooxidation on Ni–N 4 , unlike a MET in the presence of ABTS when using LAC@ZIF‐8. Thus, single atomic Ni − N 4 opens avenues with a DET mechanism.

Abstract A central challenge in water electrolysis lies with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) where the formation of molecular oxygen (O 2 ) is hindered by the constraint of angular momentum conservation. While the reactants OH − or H 2 O are diamagnetic (DM), the O 2 product has a paramagnetic (PM) triplet ground state, requiring a change in spin configuration when being formed. This constraint has prompted interest in spin‐selective catalysts as a means to facilitate OER. In this context, the roles of magnetism and chirality‐induced spin selectivity (CISS) in promoting the OER reaction have recently been investigated through both theoretical and experimental studies. However, pinpointing the key principles and their relative contribution in mediating spin‐enhancement remains a significant challenge. This roadmap offers a forward‐looking perspective on current experimental trends and theoretical developments in spin‐enhanced OER electrocatalysis and outlines strategic directions for integrating incisive experiments and operando approaches with computational modeling to disentangle key mechanisms. By providing a conceptual framework and identifying critical knowledge gaps, this perspective aims to guide researchers toward dedicated experimental and computational studies that will deepen the understanding of spin‐induced OER enhancement and accelerate the development of next‐generation catalysts.

Green transformation demands efficient protocols to convert renewable energy into usable forms. Microwave (MW)–driven catalytic systems offer a promising electrification strategy for chemical processes by enabling targeted, energy-efficient reactions. Unlike conventional heating, MW irradiation can localize energy at catalytic active sites. A major breakthrough is the selective MW heating of isolated metal ions or nanoparticles. This study presents a general catalyst design strategy to control MW-induced heating of single metal ions by tuning the zeolite framework and electrostatic interactions. Key structural and electronic factors governing atomic-scale energy localization are identified. Applying this approach to the reverse water-gas shift reaction results in energy efficiency improvements via targeted heating of single-ion sites. These findings mark a milestone in MW-assisted catalysis, establishing a framework for using MW energy in heterogeneous systems. The work introduces design principles for single-atom-antenna MW catalysts, advancing the development of next-generation catalytic reactors driven by electromagnetic energy.

Abstract The synergistic effects in multimetallic nanocrystals make them attractive catalysts, but constructing hollow architectures with controlled features poses substantial challenges. Here, the galvanic replacement reaction between Ag nanocubes and three metal precursors (Pd 2+ , Pt 2+ , and Au 3+ ) is used to demonstrate that both atomic mixing and atomic arrangements of the resulting AgPdPtAu hollow nanocrystals can be tuned through four distinct precursor addition strategies. This study reveals that increasing the mixing entropy induces a transition from phase‐separated domains to a homogeneous solid solution. Moreover, preferential bonding between deposited and template metals promotes the formation of nanocubes enclosed by {100} facets with square atomic arrangements. When dispersed on semiconductor supports, these facet‐controlled AgPdPtAu hollow nanocrystals exhibit enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. Operando synchrotron X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Pt‐containing bridge sites act as primary hydrogen adsorption centers, exhibiting high local electron density and strong hydrogen binding. Additionally, bridge sites formed by mixed‐affinity metal pairs (e.g., AuPt and AgPd), coupling strongly (Pt or Pd), and weakly (Au or Ag) hydrogen‐adsorbing elements, exhibit near‐optimal hydrogen adsorption and serve as key active sites for hydrogen evolution. This study establishes a versatile approach for engineering multimetallic hollow nanocrystals with tunable structures for catalytic applications.

Integration of renewable energy into modern power grids remains limited by intermittency and the need for reliable energy storage. Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are promising for large-scale energy storage, yet their widespread adoption is hindered by the high cost. In this study, we investigate isopropanol as a redox-active species with Pt-Cu alloy electrocatalysts for aqueous-organic RFBs. A series of PtxCu catalysts with varying Pt:Cu ratios were synthesized and studied for isopropanol electro-oxidation reaction (IPAOR) performance. Among them, PtCu demonstrated the best performance, achieving a low activation energy of 14.4 kJ/mol at 0.45 V vs. RHE and excellent stability at 1 M isopropanol (IPA) concentration. Kinetic analysis and in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy revealed significantly reduced acetone accumulation on PtCu compared to pure Pt, indicating enhanced resistance to catalyst poisoning. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further identified the first proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) as the rate-determining step (RDS) with C-H bond scission as the preferred pathway on PtCu. A proof-of-concept PtCu-catalyzed H-cell demonstrated stable cycling over 200 cycles, validating the feasibility of IPA as a low-cost, regenerable redox couple. These findings highlight PtCu-catalyzed IPA/acetone(ACE) chemistry as a promising platform for next-generation aqueous-organic RFBs.

Abstract Ni–N 4 –PAN–NC, consisting of an atomic Ni–N 4 site, mimics the intramolecular electron‐harnessing of natural laccase (LAC) confined in a zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (LAC@ZIF‐8) for anodic electrooxidation of bisphenol‐A (BPA). We have introduced a facile π‐conjugated unit of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)‐resorcinol‐derived N‐doped conjugated ‐C≡N. The atomically dispersed Ni‐single‐atom in Ni–N 4 ‐ PAN–NC exhibits high activity for the paired electrolysis of ORR and the electrooxidation of BPA with an enhanced current density. The single Ni–N 4– PAN–NC electrode effectively withdraws the electrons from electrooxidizing BPA due to a built‐in electric field via incorporation of Ni–N 4 . The paired electrolysis of Ni–N 4– PAN–NC biofuel cells is determined by LSV, EIS, and power‐polarization curve for anodic electrooxidation of BPA. Machine learning molecular dynamics (ML‐MD) simulation depicts non‐covalent interaction (hydrogen bonding) between the O‐hydroxyl of BPA and the N of the Ni–N 4– PAN–NC, suggesting preferential adsorption on the Ni–N 4– PAN–NC surface via weak van der Waals interactions and π–π stacking between the aromatic rings of BPA and the conjugated PAN‐NC. An increased power density with increased concentration of BPA in the absence of ABTS suggests a DET mechanism of BPA electrooxidation on Ni–N 4 , unlike a MET in the presence of ABTS when using LAC@ZIF‐8. Thus, single atomic Ni − N 4 opens avenues with a DET mechanism.

Atomically dispersed bimetallic catalysts (ADCs), an emerging class of electrocatalysts, combine the synergistic advantages of dual-metal active sites with the atomic dispersion and high metal utilization efficiency characteristic of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Their unique structural features offer the potential to exceed the catalytic performance of conventional systems but simultaneously pose challenges due to the absence of well-established rational design principles. This paper proposes and validates a structural design strategy, "Active Center Inheritance," wherein high-performance SACs are transformed into ADCs by retaining the same active center (M–Nx). This approach not only preserves high catalytic activity but also significantly reduces the computational cost associated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations over 13,500 candidate systems, thereby accelerating the discovery of bifunctional electrocatalysts. A total of 17 high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional catalysts were identified through this strategy. This strategy was successfully generalized to three other ADC structural systems with different spatial arrangements. Moreover, a unified descriptor (φ), composed of four key electronic and atomic features, was constructed to effectively correlate the adsorption behaviors of critical reaction intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH) across diverse systems. The results reveal that SACs and ADCs can achieve comparable catalytic activity when constructed with the same M–Nx active center, thereby enabling the synergistic optimization of active sites. This work provides a theoretical basis and a rational design framework for the development of efficient multisite electrocatalysts.

The formulation of a structured framework dedicated to the systematic review of the literature, identification of potential compounds, theoretical quantum chemistry characterization, and assessment of the significance of stability descriptors is essential for accelerating the discovery of two-dimensional materials for technological applications. In this work, we selected the two-dimensional monochalcogenides (MQ), which have attracted increased interest due to their potential applications in future devices, as prototype materials for the present investigation. Our framework started with a natural language processing analysis of more than 5400 articles, revealing a growing research interest in the two-dimensional MQ compounds, especially in electronics, energy, and fundamental studies. This led to the selection of 27 diverse MQ compounds across 13 distinct two-dimensional structural phases for density functional theory calculations, resulting in an extensive database of physicochemical properties. We evaluated formation enthalpies, uncovering clear stability trends (e.g., stability declines with heavier chalcogens, dynamic robustness of GeSe), and evaluated equilibrium lattice parameters, noting predictable expansions and significant anisotropies. Bader charge analysis offered insights into charge-transfer and ionicity trends. Our electronic structure analysis identified band gaps (direct or indirect, depending on the M element group and the weight of the chalcogen) and optical absorption anisotropies significantly influenced by crystal symmetry and spin orbit coupling. Importantly, band alignment calculations classified all possible heterojunctions as type I, II, or III, underscoring their extensive potential for future optoelectronic device development. Additionally, we incorporated machine learning, using a random forest approach, along with our density functional theory calculations to accurately forecast trends in energetic properties. This analysis identified the electronic charge as a highly significant stability descriptor among the 34 descriptors, underscoring its importance for future machine learning endeavors. Hence, this study offers a streamlined framework for the characterization and discovery of promising two-dimensional materials, highlighting the synergy between data-driven analysis and quantum-based simulations.

The development of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires advancements in both the mechanism understanding and material design. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) typically has a lower thermodynamic barrier than the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), yet controlling the OER pathway from the AEM to the LOM remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate efficient lattice oxygen activation in a spinel-structured CoFeMoRu medium-entropy oxide (CoFeMoRuMEO) catalyst through strategic octahedral engineering. The introduction of Mo increases the electron density at the Co sites, thereby weakening OH adsorption and suppressing CoOOH formation via the AEM pathway. Meanwhile, compressed RuO6 octahedra create shortened Ru–O bonds, enhancing Ru–O covalency and facilitating the critical O–O coupling step. As a result, the CoFeMoRuMEO catalyst achieves a remarkable overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA cm–2, setting a new benchmark for medium-to-high-entropy OER catalysts. Our work provides valuable insights into the transformation of the OER mechanism and performance optimization.

Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the traditional Haber–Bosch process to generate ammonia (NH3). Exploring NRR electrocatalysts with efficient performance and stability is crucial for NH3 production. In this work, on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically studied various TMO4–HTP and TMN4–HTP (TM refers to V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt; HTP refers to hexatriphenylene) of conductive two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as potential electrocatalysts for the NRR. The strong interaction between TM atoms and the O4–HTP/N4–HTP substrates could guarantee the thermodynamic and electrochemical stabilities of the designed TMO4–HTP and TMN4–HTP. The calculated results suggest that ReO4–HTP, MoO4–HTP, and MoN4–HTP could serve as promising electrocatalysts. Moreover, ReO4–HTP possesses the highest activity with a calculated limiting potential value of −0.34 V. Notably, ReO4–HTP exhibits good NRR selectivity with the effective suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our results contribute to searching for NRR electrocatalysts and highlight a potentially efficient class of catalysts based on 2D MOF materials for electrochemical reactions.

Abstract The kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) decline by orders of magnitude when varying from acidic to alkaline environments. Consequently, narrowing the kinetic gap between alkaline and acidic HOR (acid–base kinetic gap) and identifying the prominent reaction intermediates under varying pH conditions remain significant yet challenging. Herein, through introducing p‐block Ga and Sn elements, the HOR behaviors of the constructed d‐p hybridized Pd‐based catalysts are investigated under different electrolyte pH, particularly in alkaline and acidic conditions. Remarkably, the specific activity of PdGa/C alloy surpasses that of other prepared Pd‐based catalysts in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Additionally, the PdGa/C alloy exhibits the smallest acid–base kinetic gap among these catalysts. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations, it is determined that the incorporation of Ga optimizes the electronic structure of Pd via d‐p orbital hybridization, thereby enhancing the adsorption behaviors of reaction intermediates, facilitating the HOR process, and narrowing the acid–base kinetic gap. More critically, it can be inferred that the decisive reaction species for HOR vary with increasing pH, namely, it transitions from H/H 2 O species in acidic conditions to OH/H 2 O species in alkaline conditions, which accounts for the observed trends in alkaline/acidic activity as well as acid–base kinetic gap.

Atomically dispersed metal atoms within graphitic carbon have shown great potential in enhancing the performance of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), though the fundamental principles to guide their rational design remain to be fully established. Here, we report a combined computational and experimental study demonstrating that a group of metals (Ti, V, Mo, and Nb) incorporated into graphitic carbon have promising catalytic properties due to three factors: strong binding with lithium sulfides, reduced redox overpotentials, and low kinetic barriers for Li–S bond activation. In contrast, metals such as Fe and Mn show moderate catalytic behavior, while Ni representing a third group of elements has worse performance. To validate these computational predictions, we synthesized and studied three representative metal elements─Nb, Fe, and Ni─each exhibiting distinct capabilities in binding LiPSs/Li2S and catalyzing polysulfide conversion with varying overpotentials and kinetic barriers. Among them, Nb delivered the most exceptional performance, including superior rate capability (679.3 mA h g–1 at 5 C), high capacity retention (837.5 mA h g–1), and a low capacity decay rate (0.023% per cycle) after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work demonstrates an effective strategy that combines theoretical screening and experimental validation in exploring atomically dispersed metal catalysts for LSBs.

The widespread deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is hindered by the instability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts under acidic conditions, stemming from coupled degradation mechanisms: lattice oxygen overoxidation (driven by high metal-oxygen (M-O) covalency) and acid-induced metal leaching/collapse. Here, we introduce an electronegativity-guided Li- and Ru-doped spinel Co3O4 (LRCO) catalyst featuring mixed Li-O (ionic) and Ru/Co-O (covalent) bonding. This design simultaneously stabilizes lattice oxygen via strong Li-O anchoring and modulates metal valence states through Ru-O-Co electron sharing, preventing overoxidation. Operando studies reveal a potential-dependent mechanism where Ru donates electrons to Co at low potentials, forming active Ru species, and electron redistribution prevents Ru overoxidation at high potentials. Crucially, Li-O bonds effectively suppress oxygen vacancy formation throughout, and Ru-O coordination remains stable, even at high potentials. LRCO achieves a record-low overpotential of 141 mV at 10 mA cm-2 with >3,300 h stability. Integrated PEM electrolyzers operated >720 h at 1 A cm-2, achieving a key milestone toward next-decade industry targets.

Syngas electrosynthesis stands as an energy-saving strategy for producing chemical raw materials, but it remains a great challenge in achieving a balance between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, a series of single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) were constructed by uniformly dispersing different polyoxometalates (POMs) into ZnAl-layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH) through a simple stripping self-assembly technique, forming single-sandwich-layer-based ZnAl-POM (POM = W10, PW12, and P2W18) with abundant oxygen vacancies and zinc vacancies. The well-defined monodispersed W10 clusters function as electron sponges for reversibly accepting and releasing electrons to boost the level of CO2 reduction. The ZnAl-W10-3 can efficiently adjust HER and CO2RR to achieve a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.9% for both H2 and CO production. A broad CO/H2 ratio (0.32-1.35) can be obtained over the optimized ZnAl-W10-3 within a wide potential window (-0.8 to -2.0 V vs RHE) via adjusting the W10 amount. Systematic investigations reveal that W10-mediated electron and proton transfer processes and abundant unsaturated sites in ultrathin ZnAl-LDH significantly enhance the tunability of the CO2RR and HER activities.

Abstract The realization of a hydrogen (H 2 ) economy confronts formidable challenges in storage, transportation, and logistics. To address these challenges, H 2 carriers have been proposed as alternative solutions. Ammonia (NH 3 ), as one of the most promising H 2 carriers, becomes a game‐changer, offering higher volumetric H 2 density than compressed H 2 , simplified logistics, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, which thereby reduces costs and supply chain complexities. However, fully realizing NH 3 ’s potential requires overcoming downstream inefficiencies associated with its conversion either back into H 2 or into energy. Downstream processes primarily include thermal cracking, NH 3 electrolysis, and direct NH 3 fuel cells, two of which are electrochemical systems leveraging the NH 3 oxidation reaction (AOR). The efficiency of these electrochemical systems is significantly limited by severe surface poisoning and poor AOR catalytic activity, underscoring the urgent need for advanced catalyst design. Here, a comprehensive review of AOR electrocatalysis is provided, with a focus on mechanistic insights into activity‐governing steps and surface poisoning pathways. Recent advances in catalyst design are summarized, and overlooked factors are highlighted for performance enhancement. Finally, perspectives on future research directions are presented for AOR catalyst development to accelerate the integration of NH 3 ‐based technologies into the hydrogen economy.

Abstract Although molecular cocatalysts (MCs) have demonstrated significant application potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, the immobilization and stabilization of them for long‐term application remains challenging. Herein, an integrated photoanode (BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 ) is developed by immobilizing Co 4 O 4 cubanes onto NH 2 ‐MIL‐88B(Fe) (NM88B(Fe)) decorated BiVO 4 via site‐isolation strategy. The unoccupied coordination sites in NM88B(Fe) covalently bound to both Co 4 O 4 and BiVO 4 , which significantly decreases the interfacial charge transfer resistance of BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 and achieve prolonged stability. More importantly, the oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 remarkably lowered the energy barrier and thermodynamically favored surface water oxidation. Consequently, the photocurrent density of BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 photoanode achieved up to 5.26 mA·cm −2 at 1.23 V RHE , which is 3.73 times higher than that of bare BiVO 4 . This work presents a site‐isolation strategy to overcome molecular catalyst stabilization challenges in PEC systems while offering crucial insights into designing efficient charge transfer channels between OECs and semiconductors for enhanced water splitting performance.

Abstract Rational design of high‐entropy intermetallic compounds (HEICs) remains challenging due to complex structure‐property relationships and the lack of predictive tools. Here, a data‐driven framework is presented to evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of L1 2 ‐type quinary Pt 3 M(4) HEICs, where M comprises any four elements from six 3 d transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn). Guided by the Pm‐3m space group, 15 distinct compositions with numerous microstates are designed. A deep neural network, trained on 453 computed datasets, predicts hydrogen adsorption energy (∆ E H* ) across 20 000 microstructures per composition, enabling statistical mapping of site‐specific performance. To capture the effect of local atomic environments, a novel statistical evaluation approach is introduced that quantifies the number of microstates falling within the optimal ∆ E H* range, advancing beyond conventional mean‐based evaluations. Among all candidates, Pt 3 (CrMnFeCo) emerges as the most promising HER catalyst, validated experimentally over a wide pH range. Further in‐depth data mining reveals that surface Co, Cr, and Fe optimize Pt‐Pt‐M sites, while subsurface Ni and Co modulate Pt‐Pt‐Pt interactions. This study establishes a new paradigm for HEIC catalyst design and deepens the mechanistic understanding of activity origin in complex multimetal systems.

The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) can enable distributed conversion of waste to ammonia. Unlike the electrocatalytic dinitrogen reduction reaction, measurements of NO3RR often consider a fixed quantity of the nitrate anion in a batch system, presenting unique concerns for measurements of catalytic activity and selectivity. In addition, the sensitivity of kinetics and transport to electrolyte composition—where a diverse range of waste feedstocks are of interest—can have a notable impact on catalyst performance, hindering catalyst comparison. We highlight reaction complexities and advocate best practices for robust measurement of catalyst activity, selectivity, and Faradaic efficiency in this burgeoning field. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is widely studied, but under a range of conditions, with implications on catalyst performance. Here, the authors highlight potential pitfalls in comparing across (and within) existing literature and suggest approaches to assess electrocatalysts under common conditions.

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion (ECC) offers a promising route to reduce CO 2 emissions and to store renewable electricity in the form of chemical fuels. To date, ECC has been mainly based on pure CO 2 gas isolated from carbon capture solutions, which is an energy‐intensive step. Recently, direct CO 2 conversion from a capture solution, which enables integrated CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion, has attracted attention because it can eliminate the energy‐intensive CO 2 isolation step. In addition, producing concentrated gas products in integrated systems reduces the cost for downstream separation. This review discusses the key aspects of integrated CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion systems, including direct air capture (DAC), the chemistry of CO 2 capture and release, electrode designs and system configurations, as well as technoeconomic viability. First, the fundamental concepts and chemistry of CO 2 capture and in situ CO 2 release in electrochemical reactors are summarized. Then, recent advancements in integrated systems are discussed, covering both system configurations and electrode designs. Potential avenues for enhancing product selectivity toward high‐value chemicals, such as ethylene and ethanol, as well as lowering operating cell voltages and improving the economic viability of integrated systems, are highlighted. Finally, major technical and economic challenges as well as emerging research opportunities in the domain of integrated CO 2 capture and conversion are highlighted.

Abstract Determining suitable dopants with optimized doping concentration is critical to design efficient water splitting photocatalysts. However, there is currently a lack of fundamental knowledge to guide this process. Herein, we examine the impact of Al 3+ , Mg 2+ , and Ga 3+ on the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO 3 and propose a defect compensation model to understand the doping effect. Doped SrTiO 3 crystals were grown hydrothermally and treated in molten SrCl 2 . The hydrogen production rates from 50 catalysts produced in this way were measured with a high‐throughput parallelized and automated photochemical reactor (PAPCR). The investigation revealed that all three dopants significantly enhance the photocatalytic reactivity. According to Brouwer diagrams computed using available reaction constants, the optimum reactivity is achieved when the concentration of acceptor dopants fully compensates the oxygen vacancy donors. The improved reactivity can be attributed to the reduction in free electron concentration, resulting in a space charge layer that is 1000 times longer. Consequently, this situation enhances the number of photogenerated charge carriers capable of being separated by the band bending and transported to the surface.
