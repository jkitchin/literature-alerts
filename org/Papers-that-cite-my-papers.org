ABSTRACT Metal nitrides have emerged as promising materials for photoelectrochemical and electrochemical catalysis due to their unique electronic properties and structural versatility, offering high electrical conductivity and abundant active sites for catalytic reactions. Herein, we comprehensively explore the characteristics, synthesis, and application of diverse metal nitride catalysts. Fundamental features and catalytic advantages of metal nitrides are presented in terms of electronic structure and surface chemistry. We deal with synthetic principles and parameters of metal nitride catalysts in terms of nitrogen source, introducing synthesis strategies of metal nitrides with various morphologies and phases. Recent progress of metal nitride catalysts in (photo)electrochemical reactions, such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, nitrogen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and biomass valorization reactions, is discussed with their tailored roles. By providing future direction for remaining challenges, this review aims to guide the design of metal nitride catalysts from a materials point of view, contributing to expanding into energy and environmental technologies.

The aim of this study is to investigate the activity and stability of carbon aerogel‐supported platinum electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, compared to current solutions based on carbon black. Self‐synthesized carbon aerogels (pyrolyzed cellulose, and chitosan‐based aerogels) with multiscale porosity and high overall specific surface area (up to ≈2500 m 2 g −1 ), as well as Vulcan XC‐72R supports were loaded via supercritical deposition (SCD) with platinum nanoparticles (mean particle diameter ≈1.3–2.0 nm, 2.8–3.8 wt% Pt loading). Overpotentials ranged from 46.5 to 50.0 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , whereas self‐synthesized electrocatalysts had similar overpotentials as compared to a commercial catalyst with ≈8–10 times higher Pt loading. In addition, Pt‐carbon aerogel electrocatalysts had higher stability and durability as compared to Pt‐Vulcan, most probably due to the high micro‐ to mesoporosity of carbon aerogels, which promotes nanoparticle stability. The current density at 40 mV for Pt‐Vulcan decreased by 80% after 20 h, whereas an insignificant drop was observed for Pt‐carbon aerogels. These results show that the applied combination of materials (biopolymer‐based carbon aerogels) and loading method (SCD) are a promising approach for synthesizing stable electrocatalysts with reduced platinum content for green hydrogen production.

Abstract Core‐shell nanoparticles are an important class of catalytic materials due to the presence of unsaturated bonds, phase‐separated metals, and synergistic effect of more than one elements. Exploring the electronic properties such as the ‐band center () and the related catalytic properties of these materials are quite challenging due to resource consuming experiments and computationally expensive modeling of the nanoparticles. Therefore, a density functional theory (DFT) coupled recommendation system based approach is developed to predict the of the core‐shell nanoparticles. Here, the recommendation system involves completion of a core‐shell interaction matrix, where each matrix element represents the of a unique core‐shell pair. Matrix completion by predicting the interaction matrix elements is carried out using neural network. The neural network generated a low dimensional representations for each core and shell metals, which are learned iteratively to predict corresponding of the pair. The learned representations brilliantly captures the similarities and dissimilarities between metals present in shell or core. A very low train/test RMSE of 0.009/0.009 is obtained with elemental features based model. The same model is further employed to predict the ‐band width (), suggesting its transferability. This approach recommends the optimum range of / along with the combination of core‐shell metals having most efficient adsorption of species for any reaction. The results presented in this study can help experimentally design the core‐shell nanoparticles having a desired catalytic activity.

We propose a mechanism for generating single photons in the mid-infrared (MIR) using a solid-state or molecular quantum emitter. The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.

Polyimide-based dielectric materials, as excellent high-temperature-resistant polymers, play a crucial role in advanced electronic devices and power systems. However, given the limitations of composite PI materials, it is a significant challenge to simultaneously improve the dielectric constant and breakdown strength of intrinsic polyimide dielectric materials to achieve high energy density. In this study, an indiscriminate copolymerization method was proposed, which utilizes two different diamine monomers with bulky side groups (-CF3) and high polarity (C-O-C), respectively, to copolymerize with the same dianhydride monomer and prepare a series of intrinsic PI films. Remarkably, PI films with a highly dipolar rigid backbone maintain excellent thermal and mechanical properties while enhancing dipole polarization. Meanwhile, a high breakdown strength of PI is shown, because the bulky side groups act as deep traps to capture and disperse charges during the charge transfer process. Under the optimal copolymer ratio, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss are 4.2 and 0.008, respectively. At room temperature, the highest breakdown strength reaches 493MV/m, and the energy storage density and charge–discharge efficiency are 5.07 J/cm3 and 82%, respectively. Finally, based on density functional theory calculations, the copolymerization tendencies of the three monomers are verified, and it is speculated that the copolymerization ratio of PI-60% is the most stable and exhibits the best overall performance, which perfectly aligns with the experimental results. These experimental results demonstrate the exciting potential of intrinsic polyimide in thin film capacitors.

Anion‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) holds immense promise for hydrogen (H 2 ) production yet faces challenges due to the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Highly efficient and durable catalysts for HER are crucial for the successful implementation of AEMWE to produce hydrogen gas reliably. Ruthenium phosphides (Ru x P) have emerged as promising non‐Pt catalysts for alkaline HER; however, they suffer from rapid degradation due to weak RuP bonding, which cannot protect the Ru center from further oxidation and subsequent dissolution. Herein, first‐principles calculations indicate the enhanced stability of RuSe against oxidation compared to RuP, highlighting the importance of introducing Se into the Ru 2 P phase. Electrochemical studies using the selenium (Se)‐doped Ru 2 P double‐walled nanotubes (Ru 2 (P 0.9 Se 0.1 ) DWNTs) demonstrate significantly lower overpotentials (29 mV @ 10 mA cm −2 ) and robust stability (>50 h) in 1.0 m KOH, surpassing those of Pt/C. In AEMWE, Ru 2 (P 0.9 Se 0.1 ) DWNTs exhibit an outstanding performance (10.31 A cm −2 @ 80 °C, stable @ 1.0 A cm −2 for ≈200 h), surpassing state‐of‐the‐art catalysts. The findings of this study highlight the pivotal role of anion modification in enhancing the catalytic stability and performance for efficient hydrogen production in AEMWE systems.

Abstract Tuning transition metal spin states potentially offers a powerful means to control electrocatalyst activity. However, implementing such a strategy in electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) is challenging since rational design rules have yet to be elucidated. Here we show how the addition of P dopants to a ferromagnetic element (Fe, Co, and Ni) single‐atom catalyst (SAC) can shift its spin state. For instance, with Fe SAC, P dopants enable a switch from low spin state ( d x2‐ y2 0 , d z2 0 , d xz 2 , d yz 1 , d xy 2 ) in Fe‐N 4 to high spin state ( d x2‐y2 0 , d xz 1 , d yz 1 , d z2 1 , d xy 2 ) in Fe‐N 3 ‐P. This is studied using a suite of characterization efforts, including X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. When used for CO 2 R, the SAC with Fe‐N 3 ‐P active sites yields > 90% Faradaic efficiency to CO over a wide potential window of ≈530 mV and a maximum CO partial current density of ≈600 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory calculations reveal that high spin state Fe 3+ exhibits enhanced electron back donation via the d xz / d yz ‐π* bond, which enhances * COOH adsorption and promotes CO formation. Taken together, the results show how the SAC spin state can be intentionally tuned to boost CO 2 R performance.

Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution in acidic media at industrial-level current densities is limited by high overpotential, performance degradation, and thus low throughput. To address these issues, we developed a novel nanoedge-enriched molybdenum oxycarbide (MoOxCy) electrocatalysts with a uniform phase by non-equilibrium plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The vertically standing MoOxCy exhibits low overpotential of 415 mV and outstanding long-term operational stability (~ 0.11% performance degradation over 1,000 h) at high current densities up to 10 A cm− 2, corresponding to an ultrahigh hydrogen throughput of 4,477.4 L cm− 2 and a lifetime throughput of 407,033 L cm− 2 which exceed the department of energy (DOE) targets of 1,253.7 L cm− 2 and 100,503 L cm− 2, respectively. Molybdenum oxycarbide catalysts outperform state-of-the-art transition metal- and even noble metal-based catalysts (throughput of 9 ~ 269 L cm− 2 and lifetime throughput of 8 ~ 269 L cm− 2) by more than an order of magnitude for throughput and three orders of magnitude for lifetime throughput. The key mechanisms enabling high catalytic performance and stability are achieved by incorporating carbon into MoO2 lattices, which reduces the valence state of Mo, leading to weakened binding energy of Mo-H and thus improved hydrogen evolution performance. Density functional theory results suggest that the presence of carbon atoms in MoOxCy increases the binding energy between Mo and the adjacent atoms, improving the stability of MoOxCy operating under harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the development of new transition metal-based catalysts for practical industrial electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

The development of efficient and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable energy conversion. Although platinum (Pt) serves as a benchmark HER catalyst, its practical application is hindered by the high cost, limited durability, and susceptibility to CO poisoning. In this work, we report a heterojunction Pt-based catalyst, Pt@NCL-MXene, synthesized by LiF etching of MXene and subsequent NH3 calcination. This process introduces dual nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) doping and yields a nitrogen-doped carbon layer (NCL) coating on Pt nanoparticles with an average size of only 3.4 nm. Compared with conventional Pt–C catalysts, Pt@NCL-MXene exhibits a larger specific surface area, enhanced electron transfer efficiency, and an optimized d-band center, thereby facilitating both H* adsorption and desorption. As a result, Pt@NCL-MXene achieves a significantly lower overpotential of 73 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm–2, alongside improved kinetics and stability under operational conditions. Furthermore, the 9 wt % F-rich MXene support effectively suppresses CO adsorption on Pt, reducing the CO uptake to 0.224 mmol g–1, which is purportedly lower than that of Pt–C (0.264 mmol g–1), thereby mitigating CO poisoning and prolonging the catalyst's service life. These findings offer insights into the rational design of advanced CO-resistant Pt-based HER electrocatalysts.

The electrochemical synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules from biomass-derived compounds under ambient conditions is demonstrated, relying only on green sources of feedstock, renewable energy, and water. In this study, we report a two-step method of electrochemically synthesizing 5-(aminomethyl)furan-2-carboxylic acid (AFCA) from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as the nitrogen source in an acidic electrolyte. In the first step, HMF was reductively aminated into (5-(aminomethyl)furan-2-yl)methanol (HMFA) using NH2OH as the source of nitrogen. This was followed by a second step, involving the oxidation of HMFA to AFCA on a manganese oxide (MnOx) anode at the same pH. MnOx was able to selectively oxidize the alcohol group on HMFA to produce AFCA with 35% Faradaic efficiency without affecting the amine group. As both of these reactions are completed in a pH 1 electrolyte, it eliminates the need to separate HMFA before proceeding with the second reaction. Among different metal electrodes (Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, Pt and Sn) tested for the electrochemical reductive amination reaction, Ag electrodes displayed the best performance to selectively aminate HMF to the intermediate species, HMFA, with up to 69% Faradaic efficiency at mild potentials of −0.50 VRHE. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to explore a possible reaction pathway for the reductive amination on Ag(111), which suggests a thermodynamically feasible reaction even at 0 VRHE. The cathodic experimental reaction parameters were optimized to reveal that an electrolyte pH of 1 is optimal for the electrochemical reductive amination reaction. Our work shapes the future possibility of an electrochemical synthesis to produce AFCA without the need for any product separation between steps by combining the Ag cathode reaction to the MnOx anode reaction sharing the same electrolyte. Since both the cathode and anode reactions both involve four electrons transferred, combining both half reactions in a single electrochemical reactor can eliminate the need for energy-wasting auxiliary counter reactions such as hydrogen evolution or water oxidation.

Understanding active phases across interfaces, interphases, and even within the bulk under varying external conditions and environmental species is critical for advancing heterogeneous catalysis. Describing these phases through computational models faces the challenges in the generation and calculation of a vast array of atomic configurations. Here, we present a framework for the automatic and efficient exploration of active phases. This approach utilizes a topology-based algorithm leveraging persistent homology to systematically sample configurations across diverse coordination environments and material morphologies. Simultaneously, efficient machine learning force fields enable rapid computations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in two systems: hydrogen absorption in Pd, where hydrogen penetrates subsurface layers and the bulk, inducing a "hex" reconstruction critical for CO2 electroreduction, explored through 50,000 sampled configurations; and the oxidation dynamics of Pt clusters, where oxygen incorporation renders the clusters less active during oxygen reduction reactions, investigated through 100,000 sampled configurations. In both cases, the predicted active phases and their impacts on catalytic mechanisms closely align with previous experimental observations, indicating that the proposed strategy can model complex catalytic systems and discovery active phases under specific environmental conditions. Discovering active phases in heterocatalysis entails efficient configuration sampling and optimization. Here, the authors developed a framework based on topology and machine learning to effectively explore the active structures, applied in the CO2 electroreduction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized catalysis research with their efficiency and accuracy in modeling complex chemical interactions. However, adapting GNNs trained on nonaqueous data sets to aqueous systems poses notable challenges due to intricate water interactions. In this study, we proposed an active learning-based fine-tuning approach to extend the applicability of GNNs to aqueous environments. The geometry optimization and transition state search workflows are designed to reduce computational costs while maintaining DFT-level accuracy. Applied to the CO2 reduction reaction, the workflow delivers a 2-3-fold acceleration in geometry optimization through a relaxed force threshold combined with DFT refinement. The versatility of the transition state search algorithm was demonstrated on key C-C coupling pathways, pinpointing *CO-*COH as the most energetically favorable pathway in aqueous systems of Cu and Cu-based Ag, Au, and Zn alloys. The Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationship remains robust under water-induced fluctuations, with alloyed metals such as Al, Ga, and Pd, along with Ag, Au, and Zn, exhibiting coupling efficiency comparable to that of Cu. Additionally, perturbation-based training on forces and energies extends the application of GNNs to aqueous ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, enabling efficient modeling of dynamical trajectories. This work presents novel approaches to adapting nonaqueous models for application in aqueous systems, highlighting GNNs' potential in solvated environments and laying a foundation for accelerating predictions of catalytic mechanisms under realistic conditions.

Abstract Heterogeneous single-atom systems demonstrate potential to break performance limitations of single-atom catalysts through synergy interactions. The synergy in heterogeneous single atoms strongly dependes on their anchoring sites. Herein, we reveal the site-specific synergy in heterogeneous single atoms for oxygen evolution. The Ru T Ir V /CoOOH is fabricated by anchoring Ru single atoms onto three-fold facial center cubic hollow sites and Ir single atoms onto oxygen vacancy sites on CoOOH. Moreover, Ir T Ru V /CoOOH is also prepared by switching the anchoring sites of single atoms. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate the Ru T Ir V /CoOOH exhibits enhanced OER performance compared to Ir T Ru V /CoOOH. In-situ spectroscopic and mechanistic studies indicate that Ru single atoms at three-fold facial center cubic hollow sites serve as adsorption sites for key reaction intermediates, while Ir single atoms at oxygen vacancy sites stabilize the *OOH intermediates via hydrogen bonding interactions. This work discloses the correlation between the synergy in heterogeneous single atoms and their anchoring sites.
