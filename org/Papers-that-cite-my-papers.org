Nanoparticle sintering remains a critical challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we present a unified deep potential (DP) model based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof approximation of density functional theory for Cu nanoparticles on three Al2O3 surfaces (γ-Al2O3(100), γ-Al2O3(110), and α-Al2O3(0001)). Using DP-accelerated simulations, we reveal that the nanoparticle size-mobility relationship strongly depends on the supporting surface. The diffusion of nanoparticles on the two γ-Al2O3 surfaces is almost independent of the size of the nanoparticle, while the diffusion on α-Al2O3(0001) decreases rapidly with increasing size. Interestingly, nanoparticles with fewer than 55 atoms diffuse several times faster on α-Al2O3(0001) than on γ-Al2O3(100) at 800 K while expected to be more sluggish based on their larger binding energy at 0 K. The diffusion on α-Al2O3(0001) is facilitated by dynamic metal-support interaction (MSI), where Al atoms move out of the surface plane to optimize contact with the nanoparticle and relax back to the plane as the nanoparticle moves away. In contrast, the MSI on γ-Al2O3(100) and on γ-Al2O3(110) is dominated by more stable and directional Cu-O bonds, consistent with the limited diffusion observed on these surfaces. Our extended MD simulations provide insight into the sintering processes, showing that the dispersity of the nanoparticles strongly influences the coalescence driven by nanoparticle diffusion. We observed that the coalescence of Cu13 nanoparticles on α-Al2O3(0001) can occur in a short time (10 ns) at 800 K even with an initial internanoparticle distance increased to 3 nm, while the coalescence on the two γ-Al2O3 surfaces are inhibited significantly by increasing the initial internanoparticle distance. These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of the supporting surface is crucial to understanding the sintering mechanism and offer guidance for designing sinter-resistant catalysts by engineering the support morphology.

Abstract As a renewable energy conversion method, the hydrogen from seawater electrolysis needs to overcome problems such as chlorination reaction and corrosion resistance. Considering these questions, it is vital to design a highly efficient and corrosion‐resistant catalyst. Here, we developed a vanadium‐doped cobalt phosphide encapsulated within an iron oxyhydroxide shell (V‐CoPx@FeOOH) as an efficient core‐shell electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater electrolytes. In particular, the OER overpotential of the V‐CoPx@FeOOH catalyst at 100 mA cm −2 was 270 mV. Notably, V‐CoPx||V‐CoPx@FeOOH was able to operate in alkaline seawater at 500 mA cm −2 for more than 1000 h, showing excellent stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the enhanced HER activity is attributed to the introduction of V, which strengthens the bonding between Co sites and H atoms, and the optimized OER activity results from the presence of both V and Fe, which together optimize the bonding strength between Co sites and OOH intermediates. The highly efficient catalyst of the core‐shell structure has great prospects for overall water/seawater electrolysis.

Selective extraction of precious metals from urban mines plays a crucial role in mitigating the risk of depletion of precious metal resources and reducing waste pollution. However, a major obstacle in precious metal extraction lies in the difficulty of distinguishing the subtle differences in the physicochemical characteristics between them, especially gold and palladium. Herein, a proton‐driven separation system was presented for cascade recovery of gold and palladium from waste‐printed circuit boards (W‐PCBs) leachate using poly(amidoxime) (PAO) hydrogel. This exhibits an ultra‐high capacity, extra‐fast rate, and excellent selectivity for the extraction of Au(III) and Pd(II). Notably, the separation of Au(III) and Pd(II) can be achieved with high selectivity at pH = 0, resulting in a remarkable separation factor of k Au(III)/Pd(II) = 36.5. This was demonstrated to originate from the differential mechanism of PAO hydrogel for the capture of Au(III) and Pd(II) under proton‐mediated conditions. Drawing inspiration from the mechanism, the proton‐driven cascade recovery system demonstrates remarkable efficiency in sequentially recovering 99.92% of gold and 99.05% of palladium from W‐PCBs acid leachate. This research opens up a strategy to precisely separate and recover precious metals from e‐waste of urban mines.

Abstract This review focuses on the advances and outlook of integrated Ni‐based MOFs (Metal‐Organic Framework) and LDHs (Layered Double Hydroxides) photo(electro) catalysts, and addresses the pivotal gap in water splitting for sustainable energy generation application. MOFs and LDHs are two classes of materials with high potential for applications in photo(electro)catalytic water splitting reaction. However, challenges such as limited intrinsic activity, low electrical conductivity of a single material, lack of more exposed active sites, weak mass transport ability, and poor crystalline structure remain. State‐of‐the‐art strategies including doping, the development of composites, nano‐structuration are used to solve these issues. Machine learning and artificial intelligence‐assisted advanced in situ characterization techniques are proposed as unavoidable tools to address these challenges and optimize the catalyst design. This review outlines the key parameters involved in the assessment of the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic performance of water‐splitting catalysts. The importance of density functional theory in Ni‐based MOFs and LDHs for electrocatalytic water splitting is emphasized. Details about the balance of high activity along with long‐term stability as a crucial requirement for large‐scale applications are provided. This review will propel the knowledge and know‐how in using Ni‐based MOFs/LDHs as electro(photo)catalysts for hydrogen (H 2 ) production, and guide the researchers in the field.

Abstract Intermediate band solar cells offer a promising avenue to surpass the Shockley–Queisser limit of    ∼  30   %    that constrains conventional single-junction devices, with the potential to approach an efficiency limit of    ∼  45   %    in terrestrial environments by incorporating a metallic band within the valence-conduction gap. Yet, their practical realization is challenged by difficulties in developing suitable intermediate band (IB) materials. Current approaches, which involve adding inclusions or utilizing highly mismatched alloys, often degrade material quality or present significant technological hurdles. A possible solution that remains underexplored, is to identify crystalline materials that inherently possess an IB and fine-tune their properties. In this work, thousands of crystalline chalcogenides are analyzed using a detailed balance model to quantitatively evaluate their expected efficacy as IB materials. Notably, orthorhombic     VB   1     VIA   2     and     IA   4     VIA   6     compounds, such as     Ta   1     Se   2     and     Cs   4     S   6     , are projected to achieve maximum efficiencies exceeding 35%, that is, surpassing the Shockley–Queisser limit. The interplay of IB filling and chemical substitution on the properties of these systems is analyzed, to unravel the impact on performance. This study not only identifies new material candidates for IB solar cells, but also provides insights into efficiency-property relations, hence advancing the understanding of these systems.

Inorganic solid electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for realizing all-solid-state batteries because they eliminate flammable, low boiling-point liquids in lithium-ion battery cells, improving safety and cycle life. In this study, we present a highly lattice-matched composite solid electrolyte consisting of an antiperovskite-perovskite system, offering the benefits of both antiperovskites as melt-infiltratable solid electrolytes and perovskites as fast-ion conductors. Atomistic simulations predict significant lithium-ion diffusion at the interface between cubic Li2OHCl and Li0.31La0.56TiO3. The incorporation of fluorine enables room-temperature operation by stabilizing the high-temperature cubic phase of Li2OHCl1-xFx and reduces the lattice mismatch ratio to 0.8% at the interface through lattice contractions. The composite solid electrolyte was synthesized via pressure-assisted melt infiltration. The solid electrolyte effectively infiltrates conventional lithium-ion battery electrodes while maintaining a stable interface structure. Electrochemical testing demonstrates promising charge-discharge characteristics, including long cycle life and rate performance. Intricate infiltration of the solid electrolyte into an electrode structure composed of active materials with microcracks and high surface area enables stable operation by mitigating degradation phenomena typically observed in liquid electrolyte-based lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries face safety and capacity limitations. Here, authors develop a composite solid electrolyte combining anti-perovskite and perovskite phases, enabling low-temperature processing and stable interfaces. This advance supports safer, high-performance all-solid-state batteries.

The selective hydrogenation of α,β‐unsaturated aldehydes, such as cinnamaldehyde (CAL), into value‐added aromatic hydrocarbons like propylbenzene (PPR) remains a formidable challenge due to competing CC and CO hydrogenation pathways. Here, a plasmon‐enhanced catalytic strategy employing Au@Au 3 Pd core–shell nanoparticles supported on silica is reported. The catalyst features a plasmonic Au core and a 1 nm Au 3 Pd alloyed shell (25 at% Pd), enabling light‐driven modulation of reaction selectivity. Under visible‐light irradiation, the catalyst achieves complete CAL conversion with a ≈34% yield of PPR, corresponding to a 7.7‐fold enhancement in turnover frequency relative to dark conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that interfacial electronic coupling between the Au core and Pd‐rich shell upshifts the Pd d ‐band center and enhances charge transfer, promoting both CC and CO hydrogenation steps followed by hydrogenolysis to PPR. This study demonstrates a robust approach to overcome selectivity limitations in multifunctional molecule hydrogenation by harnessing localized surface plasmon resonance effects. The insights gained offer a foundation for the rational design of light‐responsive bimetallic catalysts for selective and sustainable transformations.

Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) deliver near ab initio accuracy in energy and force calculations at a low computational cost, making them invaluable for materials modeling. Although uMLIPs are pretrained on vast ab initio data sets, rigorous validation remains essential for their ongoing adoption. In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet with compound-specific ab initio (density functional theory (DFT)) data mitigates the systematic softening (i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves the alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra. While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using ∼100 structures is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for determining optimal fine-tuning data set sizes.

We report a colloidal synthesis strategy for producing MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 nanoheterostructures under mild conditions, i.e., low temperature and ambient pressure. The role of carboxylic acid ligands in directing the synthesis is systematically explored, revealing that lower ligand concentrations along with low-molecular weight molecules favor the formation of well-defined MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 heterostructures. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the resulting nanocomposites exhibit significantly enhanced electrochemical surface area and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity compared to their single-component counterparts. Specifically, MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 achieves a low overpotential of 299 mV at 10 mA cm–2, a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec–1, and a low charge transfer resistance of 9 Ω. The improved OER performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, which facilitate *OOH intermediate formation, and the MnO2 component, known for its intrinsic catalytic activity. Additionally, Mn3O4 serves as a stabilizing phase and precursor to MnO2, contributing to the overall durability and structural integrity of the catalyst.

Abstract Developing efficient oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for the progress of future energy conversion and storage systems. Herein, a fully conjugated ladder organic framework is designed with densely populated cobalt sites (HATN‐BiSalphen@KB). The molecular characteristics of the catalytic sites provide a trustworthy model for investigating the oxygen catalysis mechanism. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy demonstrate that the electronic interaction of the Co 2 N 4 O 2 and CoN 2 Cl 2 sites shifts the d ‐band center of Co atoms, optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption/desorption energetics and boosting bifunctional catalytic performance. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits exceptional bifunctional activity, achieving a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half‐wave potential of 0.983 V alongside a low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm −2 . In addition, the assembled rechargeable zinc‐air batteries demonstrate a high peak power density of 254.1 mW cm −2 and outstanding charge–discharge cycling stability for 450 h. This work provides valuable insights into designing advanced bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts through atomic‐level modulation of the coordination environment.
